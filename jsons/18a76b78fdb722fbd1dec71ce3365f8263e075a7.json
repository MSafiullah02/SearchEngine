            "text": "Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, an emerging viral infection with a global case fatality rate of 35.5%, caused major outbreaks first in 2012 and 2015, though new cases are continuously reported around the world. Transmission is believed to mainly occur in healthcare settings through aerosolized particles. This study uses Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment to develop a generalizable model that can assist with interpreting reported outbreak data or predict risk of infection with or without the recommended strategies. The exposure scenario includes a single index patient emitting virus-containing aerosols into the air by coughing, leading to short-and long-range airborne exposures for other patients in the same room, nurses, healthcare workers, and family visitors. Aerosol transport modeling was coupled with Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the risk of MERS illness for the exposed population. Results from a typical scenario show the daily mean risk of infection to be the highest for the nurses and healthcare workers (8.49 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 7.91 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively), and the lowest for family visitors and patients staying in the same room (3.12 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 1.29 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicates that more than 90% of the uncertainty in the risk characterization is due to the viral concentration in saliva. Assessment of risk interventions showed that respiratory masks were found to have a greater effect in reducing the risks for all the groups evaluated (>90% risk reduction), while increasing the air exchange was effective for the other patients in the same room only (up to 58% risk reduction).",

The new millennium, however, has marked the emergence via zoonosis of two highly virulent CoV strains novel to the human population. In 2003, a novel CoV emerged in the Guangdong Province of China that caused a new and deadly outbreak of respiratory disease in humans termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Within months, SARS-CoV spread rapidly to 25 countries (in part due to the modern, highly globalized nature of air travel), with thousands sickened and close to 800 fatal cases (Hilgenfeld & Peiris, 2013) . Investigation of the origin of SARS-CoV led first to the exotic animal markets of China and the initial implication of palm civet cats and raccoon dogs (which were found to be intermediate hosts), with further study indicating bats as the true natural reservoir of SARS-like CoVs (Han et al., 2015) . In April 2012, an outbreak of severe respiratory viral illnesses localized in several intensive care units occurred in the Middle Eastern country of Jordan; both patients and healthcare workers were infected. Within several months, cases had also surfaced in several nearby Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with rapid movement into 20 additional countries in North Africa and Europe (Al-Tawfiq, 2013; Breban, Riou, & Fontanet, 2013) . Early indications pointed to a highly virulent infectious agent, as a high percentage of patients were dying, particularly those with comorbidities. A novel strain of CoV was soon isolated and named after the region of origin in conjunction with the primary manifestation of symptoms-Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (de Groot et al., 2013) .",

Therefore, to date, containment of infectious viruses via personal hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation of MERS symptomatic persons, and quarantine of potentially exposed individuals to prevent contact with others is recommended (CDC, 2017a (CDC, , 2017b . The published literature on MERS has consistently estimated a reproductive number (R 0 ; the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case) of <1, suggesting that MERS-CoV does not yet pose a pandemic risk (Breban et al., 2013; Nishiura, Miyamatsu, Chowell, & Saitoh, 2015; Poletto, Pelat, L\u00e9vy-Bruhl, Boelle, & Colizza, 2016; World Health Organization, 2018) .

Mean incubation period for the virus has been reported to range from 2 to 15 days, with a median value of five days (Banik, Khandaker, & Rashid, 2015) . MERS-CoV infection results in fever, cough sore throat, headache, and occasionally results in nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In more severe cases, patients may experience shortness of breath, pneumonia, and death (Banik et al., 2015) . In the South Korean outbreak, the morbidity rate was estimated to be 1.08% (Ki, 2015) . The patient mortality rate has been reported to vary greatly depending on the age and underlying conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and chronic lung disease. In the South Korean outbreak, the overall mortality rate was reported to be 19.4%. MERS infected persons who were already hospitalized for other medical conditions had a higher mortality rate (33.8%) than the persons without prior medical conditions (9.2%). Similarly, patients over 60 years of age had a higher mortality rate (38.1%) than younger patients (6.4%) (Ki, 2015) .",

On contrast, studies suggested that the main transmission route of MERS was via the airborne route, especially over close contact airborne exposure (Xia et al., 2014) . Hence, isolation of index patient in a negative-pressure room and quarantine of potentially exposed persons are considered key risk management measures for literature that investigated the South Korean MERS outbreak (Cowling et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Park et al., 2017; Park et al., 2016; World Health Organization, 2015) . In consequence, isolation and quarantine would be measures that would drastically lower the risk of MERS infection once patients are identified. From previous outbreaks, the index patient stays unidentified as a MERS carrier for up to two days . Additionally, the time for identifying MERS from a diagnostic laboratory in a patient takes up to three days (Cowling et al., 2015) , so probable exposure durations around two to three days are relevant scenarios to model.",

The parameter values were selected from multiple sources including the latest reported large outbreak that occurred in South Korea, and data from other sources. Risk of infection is estimated for four types of at-risk populations: nurses and healthcare workers visiting the index patient (before the patient was identified as carrying MERS) and other patients sharing the same room; family visitors coming to visit the index patient; and the other patients sharing the same room . Risk estimation is conducted by using the Monte Carlo simulation method to incorporate uncertainty and variability in the risk characterization. Sensitivity of the model parameters is assessed to determine where additional data or knowledge could potentially reduce uncertainty and increase our understanding of these risks. Finally, the effectiveness of mask and increased ventilation risk management measures is evaluated. Rather than a retrospective case analysis, the study is intended to contribute a framework for analyzing current and future MERS risk in similar settings.",

The influence of nebulizer treatments that can be done on the index patient was considered negligible and not included in the model. Although the contribution of this treatment was suggested by Park et al. (2016) , studies have also demonstrated that nebulizers do not specifically impact transmission (Seto, 2015; Thompson et al., 2013) . Fomites may also serve as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV due to the settling of aerosols after release from infected persons. However, some studies stated that fomite-based exposure pathways were not significant compared to airborne routes, and so it was not considered in this study (Xiao, Li, Sung, Wei, & Yang, 2018) . Two forms of modeling were included in this MERS assessment: (1) modeling aerosol concentrations to identify at-risk populations in hospital settings; and (2) estimating exposure dose and characterizing risk. The risk of infection for several exposure populations was considered as follows: (1) other patients in the same room of index patient; (2) nurses; (3) other healthcare workers (e.g., doctors) visiting the index patient and others in the room; and (4) family members coming to visit the index patient.",

Expiratory events (i.e., coughing) produces a broad distribution of aerosol particles, however, this analysis was only concerned with aerosols that were likely to be inspirable and respirable. Aerosol production values were taken from Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010) and the references therein. Particles with a diameter of <10 \u00b5m were considered as respirable aerosols. Respirable aerosols are expected to be easily transported, due to their small diameter, and thus represent a potential exposure pathway for people that are farther away from the source (e.g., more than 1-2 m from the source). Thus, respirable particles were the only evaluated exposure pathway for patients sharing a room with an infected symptomatic patient. Aerosols with a diameter of 10-100 \u00b5m were considered as inspirable aerosols as these large particles are not expected to be transported long distances and are only relevant for persons in close contact.

For particles that had a terminal settling velocity greater than the critical velocity (v i(terminal) > v (critical) ), it was assumed that settling was a viable removal mechanism.

This acknowledges that all the settleable aerosol droplets settled to the floor in a time interval less than \u03c4 . However, due to the continuous generation, there were some fractions of the settleable droplets that were not yet settled. At a given time, for the droplets with terminal velocity greater than the critical velocity (v i(terminal) > v (critical) ), it was assumed that the aerosol concentration of settleable droplets was proportional to the ratio of settling velocities, as shown in Equation (7).

The number of cough events per hour was modeled based on Loudon and Brown (1967) , using the estimates for the number of cough events in nonsmokers with pneumonia. Based on Nicas and Jones (2009), we assumed that 0.044 mL of saliva was emitted per cough, which represents the most conservative estimate compared to other published volumes in the literature (Duguid, 1946; Loudon & Brown, 1967; Papineni & Rosenthal, 1997) . Saliva volume was assumed to have a uniform distribution with a \u00b110% of the reported value. Of the expired fluid, 0.00015% was considered respirable and 0.54% was considered inspirable. In other words, about 99.45% of the volume expired during each cough was considered to be nonrespirable and noninspirable, and therefore was not included in this analysis. Respirable droplets were modeled as aerosols with mean postevaporation diameters of 4 \u00b5m and 8 \u00b5m (for small and large respirable droplets), which Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010) estimated were produced at a rate of 160 and 7.5 droplets per coughing event, respectively. Similarly, based on Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010), representative inspirable droplets corresponded to aerosols with mean postevaporation diameters of 7.3 \u00b5m and 74 \u00b5m diameter droplets (corresponding to inhalable aerosols), which were produced at 41.47 and 138.48 droplets per cough, respectively. Other than this initial evaporation, it is assumed that the aerosol droplets did not change in size, including that neither further evaporation nor particle aggregation occurred. Uncertainty in the droplet production numbers was investigated by holding the number of particles constant, and using bootstrap iterations to compare the uncertainty in the relative number of particles for each of the four respective representative particle sizes. The results of the bootstrap uncertainty analysis were used to model particle production as a stochastic input.",

MERS has several similarities to SARS: both have an animal origin and appeared around 2002 in approximately the same regions-Asia and Middle East (Sutton & Subbarao, 2015) , both are respiratory CoVs with the same transmission route, both have a comparable protein structure for binding to host cells (Lu, Wang, & Gao, 2015) , and both have reported similar tropism within cells (Zhou, Chu, Chan, & Yuen, 2015) . Hence, despite probable differences in attack rates and mortality rates between the two viruses , it was assumed in this study that the SARS dose-response model is the best available model for MERS. Several dose-response studies for SARS were evaluated to determine a recommended dose-response model (De Albuquerque et al., 2006; DeDiego et al., 2008; Mitchell & Weir, n.d.; Watanabe, Bartrand, Weir, Omura, & Haas, 2010) . Recommended SARS dose-response model follows the exponential dose-response relationship (Equation (14)) for exposure dose expressed in PFU and the probability of a response based on an end point of death in mice (De Albuquerque et al., 2006; DeDiego et al., 2008) . For translating this animal dose-response relationship to a human doseresponse relationship, a generally accepted assumption that a death end point for an animal model may be used for examining the human risk of infection was applied (Haas, Rose, & Gerba, 2014) .",

Fig. 2 shows the boxplot of daily risk of infection to each group for the base scenario, meaning without any preventive interventions, the standard rate for hospitals of 6 ACH was considered (Zumla & Hui, 2014) . The median (mean) daily risk for the nurses coming to visit the index patient and other patients in the same rooms; the healthcare workers (e.g., doctors); the family members coming to visit the index patient; and the other patients sharing the room were found to be 1.33 \u00d7 10 \u22128 (8.49 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), 1.18 \u00d7 10 \u22128 (7.91 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), 6.36 \u00d7 10 \u22129 (3.12 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), and 2.73 \u00d7 10 \u22129 (1.29 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) , respectively. The estimated highest daily risk of infection for the healthcare workers and nurses suggested the frequency of airborne close-range exposure route plays a bigger role in the transmission of MERS, compared to the long-range airborne route to which other patients are exposed, confirming what was suggested by Xiao et al.'s (2018) work. Statistical t-tests showed that the daily risk of infection for healthcare workers was significantly higher than the one for the other patients or the family visitors (p-value = 0.0014 and 0.0240, respectively, at \u03b1 = 0.05). When comparing nurses and other healthcare worker, the result is not significant (p-value = 0.8475), so they have similar risks. Other patients in the same room had a statistically significant lower risk of infection compared to nurses (p-value = 0.0017), but had nonsignificant statistical differences in risk with family visitors (p-value = 0.0547). Fig. 3 shows the aggregated risk of infection for the exposed populations during multiple daily exposures to the MERS-infected patient for typical hospital durations. As expected, the results show increased risk of infection to all the exposed populations over time. The rate of increase was highest for the healthcare workers and nurses, in comparison to the family visitors, which itself had higher rate of increase compared to the other patients sharing the room. Similar to the daily risk, aggregated risk of infection was the highest for the healthcare workers and nurses, followed by family visitors and other patients. By day 41, the average risk of infection to the nurses was 1.01, 1.2, and 2.4 times the risk for the healthcare workers, family members, and other patients, respectively. Fig. 3 . Aggregated mean risk of infection rate with six air changes over days exposed. Vertical bars denote standard error. HCW = healthcare worker. Fig. 4 shows the parameter sensitivity of the model for daily risk of infection. A parameter with a greater rank correlation coefficient indicates that the input parameter distribution was more correlated with the output risk of infection for the population specified. Input parameter sensitivity can either be due to the uncertainty in estimating the value of a parameter, the known naturally occurring variance of this parameter, or because disparate data from different sources were used to estimate the range of a parameter. Here, while many parameters were modeled stochastically, only the most sensitive parameters are shown in Fig. 4 . For all exposed groups, the concentration of MERS virus in the saliva was the most sensitive parameter, which accounted for over 90% of the uncertainty in the daily risks. Because viral load of MERS in saliva is believed to naturally vary among people, sensitivity of this parameter is understood as being due to natural variance. For the family members, nurses, and the healthcare workers, the duration of each visit was the second most sensitive parameter, with contribution to variance ranging from 1.7% to 2.6%. As the other patients were assumed to be continuously exposed, this parameter was obviously not important for them.",

Animal models are being evaluated for their suitability for dose-response models, and nonhuman-primates appear promising, exhibiting similar symptoms to human (Sutton & Subbarao, 2015) . However, no dose-response models have been completed for MERS. Hence, the model developed applied a dose-response relationship based on SARS-CoV pathogen, believed to be the best surrogate to use for MERS-CoV because of their identical animal origin, same regions of main occurrence in Asia and Middle East (Sutton & Subbarao, 2015) , their consistent respiratory transmission route, their comparable protein structure for binding to cells (Lu et al., 2015) , and their similar tropism within cells . For these reasons, the proposed best-fit SARS-CoV doseresponse from QMRA Wiki website was applied (Huang, 2013) . However, it must be mentioned that some other researchers applied different SARS-CoV dose-response, such as the Xiao et al. (2018) team did. In addition, since depending on the context, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may show different or higher infectivity , the question could arise to maybe use a developed dose-response from other RNA viruses, such as influenza (Chabrelie, Mitchell, Rose, Charbonneau, & Ishida, 2018) or any other. Yet, estimated risk of infection is believed to slightly vary if using other SARS-CoV dose-responses, because of their relatively similar k parameter value: Xiao et al. (2018) 00214, all to be compared with the median k value of 0.00246 derived from the best-fit SARS-CoV dose-response provided by QMRA (Huang, 2013) .",

Running the model with a 1:1 ratio gave daily risk of infection at 6 ACH about 2 log higher than the ones reported with a 1,239:1 ratio (developed base model), with new mean daily risk of 3.07 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 2.96 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 2.26 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , and 1.39 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for nurses, healthcare workers, family visitors, and other patients, respectively (data not shown). Applying a uniform distribution from 1:1 to 1,600:1 for the copies:PFU ratio lead this parameter to contribute for risk variance to about 3%. Because the RNA copies:PFU proposed by Sampath et al.

Since an index patient in the MERS was reported having undergone a bronchoscopic examination and nebulizer therapy , risk of infection might be underestimated. However, it must be clarified that according to Seto's (2015) and Thompson et al.'s (2013) works, nebulizer usage have been proven to not significantly increase the viral transmission through air. Other exposure routes of infection, such as the fecal-oral and fomite transfer routes that have been postulated for other CoVs, were not included in this analysis.

The outbreak selected was one of the two major outbreaks that occurred in South Korea, specifically the one reported in the Samsung Medical Center hospital outbreak in Seoul, for which attack rates per population exposed were given from literature . No viral loads were reported from literature for the shedding index-patient in this outbreak. However, researchers suggest that major outbreaks occurred because of a \"super-spreader\" index-patient having a disproportionately higher viral load in their respiratory system (Xiao et al., 2018) . Hence, the model was run applying a triangular distribution based on the reported highest observed MERS-CoV concentration found in sputum of MERS-carrying patients (Min et al., 2016) , using the reported minimum of 5.00 \u00d7 10 8 , average of 6.30 \u00d7 10 8 , and maximum of 1.40 \u00d7 10 9 copies/mL. Corman et al. (2015) even reported a concentration as high as 10 11 copies/mL, but this value was not used since researchers suggested it to be very unlikely, mentioning that the probable highest concentration would more likely fall around 10 9 copies/mL during the first week of shedding. Additionally, a two-day exposure duration (before diagnosis) was set based on the observed 44-hour exposure time in the South Korean MERS outbreak . Finally, a rate of 3 ACH for the ventilation rate in the emergency room was used to match the outbreak conditions . Under these conditions, the calculated median risks of infection were found to be in the same ranges of the ones reported from Cho et al. (2016) . Estimated median risks were found to be of 2.08 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 1.82 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 9.82 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , and 7.14 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for nurses, healthcare workers, family visitors, and other patients sharing the room, respectively, while attack rates observed from the outbreak were measured at 2.72 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 1.85 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 5.56 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , and 4.44 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , for same exposed groups. These comparable results provide validity to the model developed herein; thus, demonstrating its applicability to known outbreaks. Finally, the model developed estimated risk of infection from transmission to first-generation-only patients-those infected from direct exposure to index patient-not from any potential second-or thirdgeneration contacts. Therefore, risks might be underestimated, as additional contacts would increase the exposure dose.",
