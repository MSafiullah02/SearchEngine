To tackle this still ongoing infodemic, scientific oversight as well as a better understanding by practitioners in crisis management is needed. We have conducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content of misinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain early insights into the COVID-19 infodemic. Our results enable us to not only give first indications but also to suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic. Moreover, we propose actions for authorities to counter misinformation and hints for social media users on how to help stop the spread of misinformation.",

[82] . It has even been claimed that the spread of COVID-19 is supported by misinformation [22] . The actions of individual citizens guided by the quality of the information they have at hand is crucial to the success of the global response to this health crisis. By the 23 April 2020, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) [54] uniting over 100 fact-checking organisations unearthed over 4 000 false claims regarding the pandemic. However, misinformation does not only contribute to the spread: misinformation might bolster fear, drive societal disaccord, or could even lead to direct damage -for example through ineffective (or even directly harmful) medical advice or through over-(e.g. hoarding) or underreaction (e.g. deliberately engaging in risky behaviour) [50] .",

So far, four studies have investigated the magnitude or spread of misinformation on Twitter regarding the COVID-19 pandemic [16, 33, 21, 62] . However, they either investigated a very small subset of claims [62] ; manually annotated a small subset of Twitter data [33] or used the reliability of cited sources to identify misinformation [21, 16] . In line with Vosoughi et al. [77] , we believe reliance on 'reliable' sources is problematic, as the reliability of news sources is a subject of considerable disagreement. In contrast, we use the verdicts of professional fact-checking organisations which manually check each claim. Furthermore, none of the previous studies have investigated how the language use of COVID-19 misinformation differs from other COVID-19 tweets or which Twitter accounts are associated with the spreading of COVID-19 misinformation, although there have already been some indications that bots might be involved [21, 19] .",

We believe it may be more challenging for users to recognise claims as false when they contain elements of truth, as this has found to be the case even for professional fact-checkers [37] . As such it is crucial for fact-checking organisations and governments battling misinformation, to better understand how to sustain information sovereignty [41] .

In fact, 51.9% of the re-shares of false rumours occur after this debunking comment. This may in part be due to readers not reading all the comments before re-sharing. Complete retractions of the misinformation are also generally ineffective, despite people believing, understanding and remembering the retraction [35] . Social reactance [8] may also play a role here: people do not like being told what to think and may reject authoritative retractions.Three factors that do increase their effectiveness are (a) repetition, (b) warnings at the initial exposure and (c) corrections that tell an alternate story that does not leave behind an unexplained gap [35] .",

Second, we investigate the most distinctive terms in our data to gain a better understanding of how COVID-19 misinformation differs from other COVID-19 related content on Twitter. To this end, we compare our data to a background corpus of all English COVID-19 tweets on 15/04 (See Section 3.4).

These topics may be of special interest, as there may be little correct information to balance the misinformation circulating on these topics. Third, we make use of the language used in the circulating misinformation to gauge the emotions and underlying psychological factors authors display in their tweets. The latter may be able to give us a first insight into why they are spreading this information. Again the prevalence of emotional and psychological factors is compared to their prevalence in a background corpus in order to uncover how false tweets differ from the general chatter on COVID-19.",

Since we did not use any hashtags in the data collection of our corpus of COVID-19 misinformation (See Section 3.1), this confirms that our method managed to capture misinformation related to the corona crisis. Additionally, the hashtag #fakenews stands out: the term fake news is widely used to refer to inaccurate information [84] or more specifically to \"fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organisational process or intent\" [34] . Thus, it appears that some authors are discrediting information spread by others. Yet, we are unable to determine based on this analysis who they are discrediting. Furthermore, two locations can be discerned from the hashtags: Both Spain and Qom, the first city of Iran to have corona infections, seems to be connected to COVID-19 misinformation. Another topic that is reflected in the hashtags is Event 201 (#event201 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [25] . This event is known to be used as evidence to claim that Bill and Melinda Gates predicted or profited from the coronavirus [52] . Lastly, it appears that some claims concern public applauding of Spanish health care workers (#aplausosolidario).

Also emojis relating to certain countries (i.e. United States and India) are popular. Moreover, authors use emojis to direct attention towards URLs (pointing finger). The party emojis do not appear to be used sarcastically but in reference to actual parties (e.g. 'Carnival in Bahia -WHO WILL ? -URL-' which refers to a video showing Carnival in Bahia but of which some claim it shows a gay party in Italy shortly before the COVID-19 outbreak [2] ).",

Second, compared to general COVID-19 tweets, misinformation more often concerns discrediting information circulating on social media ('fake news' 'circulating on social media' 'social media'). An example for this is the following tweet: 'Messages being circulated on social media as WHO protocol for lockdown are baseless and FAKE. WHO does NOT have any\u00e2\u0102\u0119 -URL-'.

Lastly, other phrases that more common in our corpus than in general COVID-19 tweets are: 'interferon alpha' which refers to the alleged claim that Cuba is using interferon alpha as an effective medication against the corona virus; 'aerosol infection ' which concerns whether corona is airborne; 'kibundani kwale' which refers to an alleged incident in Kenya of youth beating up a corona patient, and 'bicentennial bank' which refers to the rumours surrounding images of a robbery of this bank in Venezuela by bandits [13] .",

One of the major challenges with collecting Twitter data is the fact that the Twitter API does not allow for retrieval of tweet replies over 7 days old and limits the retrieval of retweets. As it typically takes far longer for a fact-checking organisation to verify or discount a claim, this means early replies cannot be retrieved in order to gauge the public reaction before factchecking. Recently, Twitter has created a endpoint specifically for retrieving COVID-19 related tweets in real-time for researchers [73] . Although we welcome this development, this does not solve the issue at hand. Although large data sets of COVID- 19 Twitter data are increasingly being made publicly available [14] , as far as we are aware, these do not include replies or retweets either.",

In a crisis where speed is of the essence, this is not trivial. Our data was limited by the number of claims that included a tweet (for more on data limitations see Section 6.3), causing a loss of around 90% of the claims we collected from fact-checking websites. This problem could be mitigated to some extent by employing similarity matching to map misinformation verified by factchecking organisations to tweets in COVID- 19 Twitter data [14] . However, this would be computationally intensive and require the creation of a reliable matching algorithm, making this approach far slower. Moreover, automatic methods for creating larger data sets will also lead to more noisy data. Thus, such an approach should rather been seen as complementary to our own. Probably, social media analytics support can draw from lessons learned on crisis management decision making under deep uncertainty [56] . Eventually, more work and a a scientific debate on this topic is necessary. Additionally, as an academic community it is important to explicitly convey what can and what cannot be learned from the data so as to prevent practitioners from drawing unfounded conclusions. The other way around, we deem it necessary to \"look over the shoulder\" over practitioners to learn about their way of handling the dynamics of social media, eventually leading to a better theory.",

Additionally, each fact checker appears to have its own process of debunking and set of verdicts. We even encountered cases where fact checkers discuss multiple claims in one go, resulting in additional confusion. Moreover, fact checkers do not always explicitly specify the final verdict or class (false or not) of the claim.

This will help them to keep updated on developing misinformation, as we found that for example psycho-linguistic analysis can reveal particularities that differ in misinformation compared to the \"usual talk\" on social media. Debunking fake news and keeping information sovereignty is an arms race -using social media analytics to keep pace is therefore advisable. In fact, we would recommend authorities to employ methods such as the ones discussed in this paper as they work not only expost but also during an ongoing infodemic. However, owed to the limitation of data analysis and regarding API usage (cf. with the prior and with the following section), we recommend making social media monitoring part of the communication strategy, potentially also manually monitoring it.

As we already set out in this paper, it would be ideal to provide as much discriminatory power as possible, for example by distinguishing misinformation that is completely and partly false; misinformation that is spread intentionally and by accident (maybe even with good intention, but not knowing better); and misinformation that is shared only in silos versus misinformation that leaves such silos and propagates further. Not only such a typology (maybe even taxonomy) would make a valuable contribution to theory but also in-depth studies of the propagation by type. Such insights would also aid fact checkers, who would for example learn when it makes sense to debunk facts, and whether there is a \"break even\" point after which it is justified to invest the effort for debunking.",

While Twitter is attractive for study and important for misinformation due to the brevity and speed, other social media should also be researched. COVID-19 misinformation is not necessarily restricted to a single platform and may thus be spread from one platform to another. Consequently, factchecking organisation may not mention any tweets despite a claim also being present on Twitter. Especially if the origin of the claim was another platform there may be several seeds on Twitter as people forward links from other platforms. As part of this, the spread of fake news through closed groups and messages would make an interesting object of study.",

For example, it would be worthwhile to investigate how the diffusion of misinformation about COVID-19 differs per country.",

On the one hand, social media analytics could benefit from the expertise of crisis managers and researchers in the field of crisis management in order to better interpret their findings and to guide their research into worthwhile directions. On the other hand, researchers in crisis management could make use of novel findings on the propagation of misinformation during crisis to improve their existing theoretical models in order to provide holistic approaches to information dissemination throughout the crisis. Crisis management in practice needs a set of guidelines. What we provided here is just a starting point; an extension requires additional quantitative and especially qualitative research as well as validation by practitioners.

Therefore, we have presented rich results, discussed our lessons learned, have first recommendations for practitioners, and raised many open questions. That there are so many questions -and thereby research gaps -is not surprising, as the COVID-19 crisis is among few stress-like disasters where misinformation is studied in detail 8 -and we are just at the beginning.

Rather, we will seek to verify our early findings quantitatively with much larger data sets. We will seek collaboration with other partners to gain access to historical Twitter data in order to investigate all replies and retweets to the tweets on our corpus. This extension should not only cover additional misinformation but also full sets of replies and retweets. Moreover, it would be valuable to longitudinally study how misinformation propagates as the crisis develops. Regarding COVID-19, medical researchers warn of the second wave [81] , and maybe consecutive further ones. Will misinformation also come in waves, possibly in conjunction to societal discussion, political measurements, or other influencing factors? Besides an extension of the data set, our work will be extended methodologically. For example, we seek to stance detection methods to determine the position of replies towards the claim. At the same time, we would like to qualitatively explore the rationale behind our observation.",
