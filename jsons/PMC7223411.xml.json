            "text": "The girl was admitted to the emergency department of a hosptial in Malaysia with respiratory distress. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Afterwards, she was treated for severe bronchopneumonia with IV ceftriaxone and IV azithromycin. Additionally, she required a high ventilator setting using pressure control mode. Due to persistent tachycardia with poor pulse volume, she was given an IV vitamin K, IV sodium chloride [normal saline] bolus 30 mL/kg and transfused fresh frozen plasma 15 mL/kg. Despite the high ventilator support, she was unable to maintain good oxygenation. She was started on high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) at FiO2 90, MAP 22, Rate 10, \u03bb P 40, which was further increased to FiO2 100, MAP 20, Rate 8, \u03bb P 64. Despite this treatment, the blood gas remained hypoxaemic and clinical oxygen saturation decreased to 80%. Therefore, she was commenced with inhaled nitric oxide 20 ppm. She was hypotensive, and was initiated on triple inotropes, namely IV norepinephrine [noradrenaline], IV dobutamine, and IV dopamine. An echocardiogram showed bilateral pleural effusion with normal heart and good function. Bilateral chest tubes were inserted and 70\u201380mL brownish fluid was drained. Microbiological test of both blood and pleural effusion fluid showed growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae. She immediately received two doses of IV vancomycin on day 2 and day 3, while IV ceftriaxone was continued. IV immune-globulin [immunoglobulin] was also administered twice on day 2 and day 4.",
