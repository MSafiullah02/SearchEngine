Pan coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was positive for the throat swab sample, and sequencing of the PCR amplicon showed that the sequence was identical to that of the 2019-nCoV isolated from the Wuhan patient.

Entry screening may help slow the importation of an emerging virus. However, it is not a guarantee against the possible importation of it, because it could miss many infected but asymptomatic or mild symptomatic passengers. During the pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, a study at Auckland International Airport showed the sensitivity of the screening method was only 5.8%. 6 Therefore, once the virus is spreading widely and an epidemic already starts, the entry screening will add little value to contain it. The real benefit is its advertising effect; it may raise travelers' awareness and educate them about what they should do if they develop symptoms after arriving. ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It is important to note that the patient had pneumonia as early as three days after the symptom onset, although her condition was stable. During the first three days, she did not develop any clinical features suggesting pneumonia, such as sputum, pleuritic chest discomfort, hemoptysis, crackles on lung auscultation, and infiltrates in chest radiography. If we had not taken an HRCT scan of the lung, we would have missed the pneumonia diagnosis. This case highlights that the possibility of 2019-nCoV pneumonia cannot be excluded based only on the clinical clues mentioned above. This clinical feature, i.e., mild flu-like symptoms despite pneumonia during the first week of illness (\"walking pneumonia\") resembles that of MERS-CoV pneumonia. 7, 8 We do not know the infectious period of 2019-nCoV pneumonia yet. We also do not know if patients with mild (or upper respiratory tract infection) symptoms are less infectious than patients with pneumonia. What makes the problem more confusing is that we cannot predict who may progress from upper respiratory infection to pneumonia. Considering all this, it is safer to do a 2019-nCoV screening test for all symptomatic patients with epidemiological risk than to wait until pneumonia develop and then test them. Any clinical criteria for pneumonia would miss substantial number of pneumonia patients, especially during the early phase of illness. Infected individual before symptom onset may transmit 2019-nCoV to other people, 9 but it remains to be determined how common are such transmissions.
