Mortality among children younger than 5 years dropped from 54\u00b71 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 1990 to 12\u00b75 per 1000 livebirths in 2015,1 meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 well ahead of schedule. Additionally, the maternal mortality ratio declined from 111\u00b70 deaths per 100 000 livebirths in 1990 to 21\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015,1 achieving MDG 5 on target. China has also met the target for reducing the number of maternal deaths in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, but the challenge of improving equity remains.",

They used data from China's national Annual Report System on Maternal and Child Health to analyse the progress made in achieving MDG 5 and the level and trends of maternal mortality ratios across China from 1996 to 2015, including inequalities. Overall, maternal mortality ratios declined substantially and rapidly, from 108\u00b77 per 100 000 livebirths in 1996 to 21\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015, making the annualised rate 8\u00b75%. As expected, substantial heterogeneity was found at the county level. However, at the provincial level, trends in inequality varied, showing much smaller inequalities within provinces than between provinces. This disparity illustrates the substantial geographical inequity of maternal health in China.",

In 2000, the maternal mortality ratio was 29\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 livebirths in urban areas and 69\u00b76 per 100 000 livebirths in rural areas, giving an urban-to-rural ratio of 1:2\u00b737. By contrast, in 2015, the maternal mortality ratio had declined to 19\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in urban areas and 20\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in rural areas, reducing the urban-to-rural ratio to 1:1\u00b705.3\n",

Most of these counties were in poor rural areas in western China. If as well as maternal mortality ratios, the rate of decline in these ratios in the western regions is taken into account, the gap has been gradually shrinking. From 1990 to 2015, the total maternal mortality ratio in China declined by 4\u00b742 times, while that in Tibet declined by 7\u00b712 times, catching up with the national average maternal mortality ratio.5 Since the start of the 21st century, China has taken targeted measures to help people lift themselves out of poverty, improving women's status and education equity, which will all contribute to the improvement of maternal health.1\n",

However, a question worth exploring is whether it is appropriate to calculate and compare maternal mortality ratios by county. The population differences between provinces in China are large, and between counties are even greater. The largest county in China has a population of 2\u00b744 million, while the smallest has a population of less than 10 000. The number of livebirths in the small counties can be less than 200 per year.8 Many of the small counties are located in the western regions. Thus, the maternal mortality in these counties can be very unstable from year to year, which should be considered when drawing conclusions from Liang and colleagues' research.",
