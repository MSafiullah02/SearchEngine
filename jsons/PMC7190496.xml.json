This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS\u2010CoV, and may cause acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV (Li et al., 2020). The characteristic symptom reported by patients with COVID\u201019 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. It has been recently described that SARS-CoV-2 has neurotropic activity with neurological consequences leading to centrally mediated respiratory insufficiency due to virus invasion into the brainstem (Li et al., 2020). The fatality rate is the highest among elderly and those with comorbidities and immunological deficiency.",

All patients gave consent on study participation and requested anonymity, which was fully guaranteed. The demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1\n. All patients were tested after reported person-to-person contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and had viral infection confirmed with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens. All of them had two-week quarantine since documented exposure and none developed clinical manifestations of infectious disease. They also did not report any significant changes in neurological status in the course of primary nervous system disease.",

Recognition of modest antiviral effects shown for amantadine, rimantadine, memantine, and bananin in models for bovine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, human coronavirus OC43, and SARS\u2010CoV, led to the suggestion that adamantanes could be repurposed for COVID-19 (Cimolai, 2020). Among adamantanes, amantadine and memantine are commonly used as symptomatic treatment to alleviate fatigue, parkinsonian symptoms and cognitive dysfunction (respectively) and might be of potential to protect against COVID-19 among the most fragile patients (Tipton and Wszolek, 2020).",
