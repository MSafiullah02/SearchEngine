Mechanisms of HEV replication in host cells are unclear, and only a few cellular factors involved in this step have been identified so far. Here, we used brefeldin A (BFA) that blocks the activity of the cellular Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2, which play a major role in reshuffling of cellular membranes. We showed that BFA inhibits HEV replication in a dose-dependent manner. The use of siRNA and Golgicide A identified GBF1 as a host factor critically involved in HEV replication. Experiments using cells expressing a mutation in the catalytic domain of GBF1 and overexpression of wild type GBF1 or a BFA-resistant GBF1 mutant rescuing HEV replication in BFA-treated cells, confirmed that GBF1 is the only BFA-sensitive factor required for HEV replication. We demonstrated that GBF1 is likely required for the activity of HEV replication complexes. However, GBF1 does not colocalise with the ORF1 protein, and its subcellular distribution is unmodified upon infection or overexpression of viral proteins, indicating that GBF1 is likely not recruited to replication sites.",

It is a quasienveloped virus containing a linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that encodes three open reading frames (ORFs), namely, ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 (Tam et al., 1991) . ORF1 is the largest gene that encodes a non-structural polyprotein (ORF1 protein) that contains several functional domains essential for viral replication (Koonin et al., 1992) . These functional domains include the methyltransferase (Met), papain-like cysteine protease, RNA helicase (Hel), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (reviewed in Debing et al., 2016) . To date, there is no clear evidence of ORF1 protein processing by protease and antibodies that robustly recognise ORF1 protein are not available. ORF2 encodes the ORF2 viral capsid protein, which is involved in particle assembly, binding to host cells and eliciting neutralising antibodies. Very recently, we demonstrated that during its lifecycle, HEV produces three forms of the ORF2 capsid protein: ORF2i (infectious/intracellular ORF2), ORF2g (glycosylated ORF2), and ORF2c (cleaved ORF2). The ORF2i protein is associated with infectious particles, whereas ORF2g and ORF2c proteins are massively produced glycoproteins that are not associated with infectious particles and are the major antigens present in HEV-infected patient sera (Montpellier et al., 2017) . ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional phosphoprotein that is involved in virion morphogenesis and egress (reviewed in Holla, Ahmad, Ahmad, & Jameel, 2013) .",

The inactive, cytoplasmic GDP-bound form of Arf proteins, upon nucleotide exchange to GTP, undergoes conformational changes that allow Arf-GTP proteins to bind membranes. The active GTP-bound form of Arf proteins is essential for the formation of secretory vesicles, actin remodelling and phospholipid metabolism by recruiting to membranes effectors that mediate these processes. BFA blocks Arf activation by inhibiting a subset of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that regulate the conversion of Arf-GDP into Arf-GTP. In human cells, BFA inhibits the function of three of the 15 known Arf GEFs: GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2, by stabilising normally transient complexes formed between the GEF and Arf-GDP. Here, we demonstrate that BFA inhibits HEV replication and identified GBF1 as the BFA-sensitive GEF required for HEV replication.",

The Gaussia luciferase (Gluc)-encoding subgenomic replicon construct derived from the HEV gt3 Kernow-C1 p6 strain was modified to produce the subgenomic replicon p6 SP GLuc. In this replicon, the first 20 amino acids matching with the signal peptide of Gaussia luciferase were deleted to block secretion of the luciferase. In this context, the amount of intracellular GLuc is proportional to viral RNA synthesis and consequently to HEV replication. In addition, this system allows replication to be monitored independently of protein secretion that is blocked by BFA. Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated with in vitrotranscribed p6 SP GLuc RNA and luciferase activities were measured at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hr post-electroporation (p.e.). For each time point, values are presented as fold increase compared to luciferase activities measured at 6 hr p.e. As shown in Figure 1a , the level of p6 SP GLuc steadily increased over time to reach a fold increase of 490 times at 72 hr p.e., indicating that the p6 SP GLuc replicon efficiently replicates in Huh-7.5 cells and can be used as a tool to study the HEV replication step. HEV-p6 SP GLuc-electroporated Huh-7. (Figure 1b) , indicating that BFA is an inhibitor of gt3 HEV replication. Next, to verify that the decrease of HEV replication was not due to a toxic effect of the BFA treatment, we performed a 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium viability assay on Huh7.5 cells treated for 16 hr with BFA. As shown in Figure 1d , although a weak toxicity was observed at 1 \u03bcg/ml, the concentration of 0.1 \u03bcg/ml for which HEV replication was reduced by 1 log had no significant toxic effect, indicating that the inhibitory effect of BFA on HEV replication was not due to cell toxicity. In order to confirm the inhibitory effect of BFA on HEV replication in another cell line, we next analysed BFA activity on HEV replication in PLC3 cells, a PLC-PRF-5 derived cell clone that highly replicates HEV genome (Montpellier et al., 2017) (Figure 1a , PLC3/p6 SP GLuc). As shown in Figure 1e , BFA efficiently inhibited p6 SP GLuc replication in transfected PLC3 cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of BFA on HEV replication is not cell line dependent.",

Among the 15 members of the Arf GEF family in human cells, only three are inhibited by BFA: BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1 (D' Souza-Schorey & Chavrier, 2006; Gillingham & Munro, 2007) . To check which of the three BFA-sensitive GEFs are required for HEV replication, we analysed the effect of their depletion on HEV replication ( Figure 2 ). However, GBF1 silencing was toxic in our experimental conditions due to the slow kinetics of HEV replication, which requires long depletion times. As an alternative, we used Golgicide A (GCA) that specifically inhibits GBF1 with no effect on BIG1 and BIG2 (S\u00e1enz et al., 2009 ). Huh7.5 cells were transfected with siRNA pools targeting BIG1, BIG2, BIG1 and BIG2 or a non-targeting siRNA pool ( Figure 2a ). Two days post-transfection, depleted cells were electroporated with the p6 SP GLuc replicon, and luciferase activities were measured at 24, 48, and 72 hr p.e., as described previously. As shown in Figure 2b , depletion of BIG1, BIG2 or BIG1 and BIG2 together did not result in any significant decrease of HEV replication levels. In contrast, when p6 SP GLuc-electroporated Huh-7.5 cells were treated with GCA, which specifically targets GBF1, HEV replication levels were strongly inhibited ( Figure 2c ) without any significant toxicity ( Figure 2d ). Altogether, our results suggest that GBF1 is likely the BFA-and GCA-sensitive factor required for HEV replication.",

The R2 cell line is resistant to 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of BFA and able to support HCV replication in the presence of 100 times more of BFA than the parental Huh-7 cell line. This resistance is due to a point mutation (M832L) in the sec7 catalytic domain of GBF1, which is known to impair the binding of BFA (Farhat et al., 2013) . In order to confirm that BFA inhibition of HEV replication was only related to the effect of the drug on GBF1, we transfected the p6 SP GLuc replicon in R2 and parental Huh-7 cells (Figure 3 Together, these results support the conclusion that GBF1 is the BFA-sensitive factor that is required for HEV replication, and that the inhibition of HEV replication is not due to a direct effect on the virus. FIGURE 2 GBF1 is the brefeldin A-sensitive factor required for hepatitis E virus replication.

Indeed, it has been shown that GBF1 overexpression or expression of the M832L BFA-resistant GBF1 mutant can rescue HCV replication from BFA inhibition whereas expression of the E794K catalytically inactive GBF1 mutant cannot (Farhat et al., 2016; Goueslain et al., 2010; Jackson & Casanova, 2000; Niu, Pfeifer, Lippincott-Schwartz, & Jackson, 2005) . We therefore transfected Huh-7.5 cells with plasmids expressing YFP-fused wildtype GBF1 (GBF1wt) Liang, Zheng, Bao, & Zhang, 2017; Qin et al., 2014; van der Linden et al., 2010; Verheije et al., 2008; Wang, Du, & Jin, 2014) . However, it has been shown that GBF1 is not involved in the formation of poliovirus, mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and HCV replication complexes but rather in their maturation or activity (Belov et al., 2008; Goueslain et al., 2010; Verheije et al., 2008) . In order to investigate how GBF1 is involved in HEV replication, we next performed time-course experiments in which BFA was added for 16 hr at various time points (0, 24, and 48 hr) after electroporation, and replication levels were measured at 24, 48 and 72 hr p.e. (Figure 5) . A strong inhibition of HEV replication by BFA was observed whatever the time of addition of the drug, even when BFA was added 48 hr p.e., indicating that BFA is able to inhibit HEV replication in cells in which replication complexes are already formed. Together, these results suggest that GBF1 is required for the activity of HEV replication complexes and not for their assembly.",

As expected, in non-transfected PLC3 cells, GBF1 staining was observed in Golgi-like perinuclear structures and in cytoplasmic small dot-like structures ( Figure 6, PLC3) . Similar intracellular GBF1 distributions were observed in HEV-replicating cells (Figure 6 , PLC3/HEV-p6), indicating that the major subcellular localisation of GBF1 is not modified upon HEV replication and therefore is likely not recruited and stably maintained on HEV replication complexes. The same results were obtained in transfected Huh-7.5 cells (data not shown). As an alternative approach to determining whether GBF1 is recruited to the replication sites, we analysed the subcellular localisation of GBF1 in cells overexpressing the non-structural ORF1 polyprotein in combination or not with the structural ORF2 and ORF3 proteins (Figure 7) . The ORF1 protein was detected with three different antibodies directed against either the Met, Hel, or Pol domain. We observe no difference in the localisation of GBF1 upon expression of the viral proteins. In addition, GBF1 and ORF1 did not co-stain regardless of the antibody used, strengthening our hypothesis that GBF1 is probably not recruited to HEV replication sites.",

The site of RNA replication within the host cell has not been identified yet. However, the use of vector systems showed that the non-structural ORF1 polyprotein might be membrane-associated and localised in the ERGIC, suggesting that HEV replication might occur within the early secretory pathway (Perttil\u00e4 et al., 2013) . In our study, we show that activity of HEV replication complexes strongly depends on GBF1, a GEF regulating the activity of Arf small G-proteins, which in turn are key regulators of the cellular secretory pathway. We demonstrate that BFA and GCA, a specific inhibitor of GBF1, inhibit HEV replication and that GBF1 is the only BFA-sensitive cellular factor required for HEV replication.",

GBF1 also participates in Golgi morphogenesis and lipid droplet metabolism (Jackson & Bouvet, 2014) . In addition, GBF1 is hijacked by several positive-strand RNA viruses including Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae members for their replication (Belov et al., 2008; Carpp et al., 2014; Goueslain et al., 2010; Lanke et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2014; van der Linden et al., 2010; Verheije et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014) . For instance, GBF1 was shown to interact with poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) non-structural protein 3A (Wessels et al., 2006; Wessels et al., 2007) . GBF1 overexpression rescues enterovirus replication in cells treated with BFA, whereas its silencing strongly inhibits viral replication (Belov et al., 2008; Lanke et al., 2009 ). The precise role of GBF1 in enterovirus replication is not clear. It has been proposed that Arf-activating function of GBF1 would be necessary for enterovirus replication to recruit other cellular factors supporting replication such as the phosphatidylinositol kinase PI4KIII (Hsu et al., 2010) . However, more recent data suggest that enterovirus replication requires the N-terminal region of the GBF1 protein but not its Arf-GEF activity (Belov, Kovtunovych, Jackson, & Ehrenfeld, 2010; Viktorova, Nchoutmboube, Ford-Siltz, & Belov, 2015) . In contrast, GBF1-mediated Arf1 activation is crucial for mouse hepatitis coronavirus RNA replication (Verheije et al., 2008) . GBF1 is also a host factor required for HCV replication (Goueslain et al., 2010) . In contrast to enteroviruses, no interaction between GBF1 and viral proteins has been reported so far. In addition, it has been shown recently that the role of GBF1 in HCV replication is mediated by its Arf-GEF activity (Farhat et al., 2016) . Interestingly, Arf4 and Arf5 were shown to be essential for mediating GBF1 function in HCV replication, yet depletion of these two Arf proteins did not inhibit the secretory pathway, instead affecting lipid metabolism (Farhat et al., 2016) . In our study, we demonstrate that GBF1 has essential functions in HEV replication.",

            "text": "Further experiments using Arf protein expression knockdown, and mutants of the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1 (Farhat et al., 2016) , are now necessary to define the importance of Arf-GEF activity of GBF1 in HEV replication. (Belov et al., 2006) and ER-resident reticulon proteins (Tang et al., 2007) , whereas alphaviruses subvert amphiphysins localised at the plasma membrane for membrane remodelling and viral RNA replication (Neuvonen et al., 2011) . As mentioned previously, GBF1 is essential for the replication of enteroviruses, coronaviruses, and flaviviruses, all of which are viruses inducing remodelling of intracellular membranes. In the present study, we demonstrated that GBF1 is a cellular factor required for the activity of HEV replication complexes. Based on the fact that viruses using GBF1 for their replication induce membrane rearrangements, we can therefore speculate that HEV replication might depend on such membrane reshuffling. Further studies using electron microscopy of cells highly replicating the HEV genome are thus required to test this hypothesis.",

            "text": "In order to determine whether GBF1 is recruited by the ORF1 protein at replication complexes, as observed for poliovirus and CVB3 non-structural protein 3A (Wessels et al., 2006; Wessels et al., 2007) , we analysed the subcellular distribution of GBF1. However, although the full-length protein or domains of the non-structural ORF1 protein can be detected by antibodies in cells transfected with vector systems (Lenggenhager et al., 2017; Perttil\u00e4 et al., 2013) , these antibodies fail to detect ORF1 protein in HEV-replicating cells (data not shown; Lenggenhager et al., 2017) . This lack of tools directed against ORF1 prevents us from analysing whether GBF1 is recruited to replication complexes in HEV-replicating cells. As an indirect approach, we first analysed the subcellular distribution of GBF1 in HEV replicating and non-replicating cells and found no evidence of a change in its intracellular localisation. As a second alternative approach, we studied the subcellular distribution of GBF1 in cells overexpressing the ORF1 viral replicase and found that GBF1 intracellular pattern was unaffected by viral protein expression. In addition, we did not find any evidence of GBF1-ORF1 co-localisation. These results suggest that, as for its involvement in HCV replication, GBF1 might have an indirect role in HEV replication by activating effectors involved in HEV replication. However, further experiments of co-staining of ORF1 protein and GBF1 in HEV-replicating cells are needed to elucidate the involvement of GBF1 in HEV replication. The development of tools allowing the probing of ORF1 protein in HEVreplicating cells is thus essential to characterise the mechanisms of HEV replication and the involvement of GBF1. ",

Two days post-transfection, expression levels of YFP-fused GBF1 proteins and YFP protein were controlled by western blotting (Figure 4a) and fluorescent microscopy (Figure 4b), and transfected with the fulllength infectious p6 RNA (Figure 4c). Cells were next treated for 16 hr with 75 ng/ml BFA, a concentration that inhibits approximately 60% of the HEV replication. It has to be noted that BFA treatment had no impact on the subcellular localisation of GBF1 proteins (Figure 4b). Four days p.e., cells were fixed and analysed by immunofluorescence with an anti-ORF2 capsid protein antibody, as described in For each transfection, control DMSO values were set to 100%, and the corresponding percentage was calculated for the BFA treatment condition. As shown in Figure 4c, upon treatment with BFA, the number of ORF2-positive cells was reduced by approximately 50% in cells transfected with YFP and GBF1EK mutant. In contrast, overexpression of GBF1wt led to an increase of 20% in the number of ORF2-positive cells, and the expression of the BFA-resistant mutant M832L restored more than 35% of HEV replication, as compared to DMSO treated cells, indicating a protective effect of functional GBF1 overexpression over BFA-induced inhibition of HEV replication. 2.5 | GBF1 is likely required for the activity of HEV replication complexes and not for their assembly Several viruses of the Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae families rely on GBF1 for their replication (Belov et al., 2008; Carpp, Rogers, Moritz, & Aitchison, 2014; Goueslain et al., 2010; Lanke",

This compartmentalisation allows coordination of the different steps of the replication cycle, resulting in highly efficient RNA replication as well as protection of the viral genome from cell defense mechanisms. These remodelled membranes are characterised by two different types of membrane structures: the invaginated vesicle or spherule type induced for instance by Dengue virus and the double membrane vesicle induced for instance by poliovirus and HCV (reviewed in Paul, 2013). To induce and maintain such membrane rearrangements, viruses usurp cellular factors that are active on membranes. For instance, enteroviruses recruit Arf GEFs to rearrange Golgi and ERGIC membranes",
