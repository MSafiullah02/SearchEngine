The most common diagnoses were: symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. 65% of clinical consultations resulted in extractions, 0.5% an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25km on average to access care, however this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and to our knowledge no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure.",

At this early stage and in the absence of national guidance, the clinic had to balance providing a core service for the most in need (aiming to minimise dental attendances at Medical Emergency Departments) against limiting patient throughput with a new, stricter triaging system to protect staff, other patients, and to preserve potentially limited personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. Following the inception of the adapted clinic on the 23 rd March 2020, national guidance (3) was published on the 25 th March, stipulating that dental practices stop seeing patients face-toface, leading to 337 NHS practices in our region closing their doors overnight. This guidance stated for patients to contact their General Dental Practitioner (GDP) for Advice, Analgesia and/or Antimicrobials (commonly referred to as AAA) in the first instance, prior to any referral to a local UDCC to try and minimise patient travel and unnecessary attendances.",

Figure 1 illustrates some key events in the COVID-19 pandemic alongside milestones in the development of the NDH UDCC. The clinic quickly transitioned to using remote triage for all patients, both in, and out-of-hours (OOH). In-hours (Monday-Friday 8.30-16.30) triage was initially via walk-in and direct calls to the clinic from patients and dentists. With the assistance of NHS111, a national free-to-call non-emergency medical helpline (4), the inhours service at NDH progressed to only accepting referrals by email, mainly from GDPs and NHS111 to manage the flow of referrals. A limited number of exceptions were made for clinically urgent walk-in cases who were triaged at a designated desk at the entrance of the building. All patients referred by email had a further telephone triage by a dentist to establish their need for treatment and advice or an appointment was given. OOH triage (i.e. weekends) was provided by NHS111/DCAS. Both in-hours and OOH the service was divided into three distinct areas within the hospital: one for COVID-19 symptomatic and isolating patients; another for the asymptomatic; and a separate clinic for shielding and vulnerable patients (referred to as shielding in our practice) to minimise the risk of cross infection. The criteria for COVID-19 symptomatic patients was in line with NHS advice (5) and we limited treatment in this group to true dental emergencies only (trauma, swelling or bleeding). The criteria for shielding patients is defined by the NHS as those who would be 'extremely vulnerable' if they were to contract COVID-19. These patients were grouped with those defined as 'vulnerable' under the general headings of:",

The number of patients reporting failure of AAA increased throughout the study period. This increase could represent more stringent enforcement of optimal AAA by our triage team prior to a clinical visit, or it could suggest that these measures aren't sufficient to manage severe dental pain.

This was followed by a continued high number of referrals to the service, which peaked in week 5 before declining as more UDCCs became operational across the region in weeks 5 and 6. Due to the initial almost four week period where NDH UDCC was the only service provider, patients accessed the service from a wide geographic area. This was clearly an undesirable situation given that UK government advice recommended only essential travel, avoidance of public transport where possible (25) , and the need for community-centred care to reduce flow into hospitals in order to limit the spread of infection (26) . In the final two weeks as more UDCCs were established, patient volumes decreased and patients became more local to the hospital, allowing a reduction in staffing level on the clinic and in turn, the number of potential infectious contacts for staff members. This demand for the NDH UDCC in the early stages of the pandemic, due to lack of service provision regionally, demonstrates the need for early contingency planning in dentistry for future pandemics.

Our management of symptomatic or isolating patients was to try and avoid any attendance if at all possible, accepting only dental trauma, swelling or bleeding as reasons for attendance in this group, which would have reduced this number further.

For the 'triage diagnosis' this was not always recorded and in this case the data collectors were asked to review the information recorded and use their judgement to give the most likely diagnosis (or reason for contact). Our anonymised data collection did not include a patient identification number meaning we were unable to retrospectively state the exact number of individual patients seen within the service, rather we report consultation episodes. The data and experiences presented in this paper are our experience.

Very few symptomatic COVID-19 patients accessed the service but demand from those shielding was high.
