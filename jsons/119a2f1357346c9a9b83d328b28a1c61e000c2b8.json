The specimens were examined using fluorescein isothiocyanate-(FITC) and gold-labelled antiserum to S. pyogenes and fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. S. pyogenes could be identified both in the mucous layer covering the tonsils and attached to the surface epithelial cells. Long chains of coccus-shaped bacteria could be seen encroaching on the epithelial cell borders. S. pyogenes can apparently penetrate the mucous barrier, attach to the epithelial cells, spread from cell to cell and possibly penetrate into the outermost layer of the epithelial cells. These events in turn provoke cytokine production and/or complement activation, which induce inflammatory reaction in the tonsillar tissue.",

Their palatine tonsils showed signs of acute inflammation: an inflamed surface, pus plugs in the tonsillar crypts and a yellowish exsudate partly covering the tonsillar surfaces. A rapid identification test for S. pyogenes in swabbed material obtained from the palatine tonsils proved positive (Streptest, Pharmacia, Sweden) and subsequent aerobic culturing on blood-agar and chocolateagar plates (incubation in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 for 24-48 h at 37\u00b0C) could confirm the initial bacteriological diagnosis. Swabbed material was obtained from both tonsils by rotating a cotton wool tipped swab on the tonsillar surfaces within 24 h of onset of the pharyngeal symptoms. No antibiotics had been administered prior to sampling. All material was loosened from the swab by rinsing it in 8 ml physiological saline. The samples were homogenized by extruding the cell suspension twice through a 20 G needle in order to disrupt clumps. The cell suspension was then pressed through a filter (pore size 5 vm; Sartorius, Ministart, NML), which allowed unattached bacteria to pass but trapped epithelial cells with and without attached bacteria. Both cell fractions were used in the subsequent analysis. The cell mixtures were given a light centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 rpm to harvest the cells at the bottom of the tubes. The supernatants were carefully discharged using a Pasteur pipette. Thereafter, the precipitates were adjusted to 0.5 ml with physiological saline. The samples were then treated as follows: 2.1.

A rapid desquamation of such infected cells must be regarded as being of the utmost importance in host defence. Any factor hindering desquamation of these infected cells will increase the susceptibility to S. pyogenes infection. In our study we recognized only a few intracellular pathogens. Thus our findings were in accord with a previous report [18] which showed that bacteria do not to any great degree penetrate the tonsillar epithelium during acute pharyngotonsillitis.",
