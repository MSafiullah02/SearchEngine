The highest mortality rate is found among infants requiring surgery 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The overall incidence of NEC varies between studies, from 0.3 to 1.0 per 1000 live births 1, 6, 7. However, in extremely preterm and very low birth weight infants, the incidence is approximately 7% 5, 8. The pathogenesis of NEC is multifactorial, and there are some factors that remain unknown 4, 5.",

Seasonal variations in the incidence of NEC have been described, which also indicate that an infectious agent may contribute to the clustering of the disease 6, 12, 15. Several microbial organisms have been proposed as possible causes of NEC, for example Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus Aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, norovirus and rotavirus, but no specific causative organism was identified in some outbreaks 9, 11, 14, 16, 17. It has also been suggested that overcrowding in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has contributed to clusters of NEC 14. Nevertheless, the majority of reports describing outbreaks of NEC are retrospective and based on observed suspected outbreaks that could just be random. Furthermore, most of the described outbreaks have been on a hospital level, while clustering based on the mother's residential municipality has not been addressed 9, 11, 12, 13. In reports on NEC outbreaks, the cluster concept tends to be used subjectively without a standard definition 18.",

The Knox test is based on an analysis of the proximity in space and time of all possible n(n \u2212 1)/2 distinct pairs of cases 23. Each individual pair is classified into one of four cells in a 2 \u00d7 2 table, with distance (close/not close) and time (close/not close) on the two axes, according to whether the two parts are close or not close to each other in terms of geographical distance and time. A pair of cases is regarded as being in close proximity if their dates of birth are close and if their geographical locations at the time of birth are close. Closeness in the date of birth was divided into time windows of seven, 14 and 21 days apart. Two geographical levels were used to define closeness in space: the mother's residential municipality and the delivery hospital. The number of pairs of cases observed in close proximity was compared with the expected number of pairs, which was obtained from the cross\u2010products of the column and row totals. If the observed number of pairs of cases exceeded the expected number of pairs, there was evidence of space\u2013time clustering. The magnitude of the excess, or deficit, was estimated by calculating the strength of clustering using the equation S = [(O\u2010E)/E] \u00d7 100, where S was the strength, O was the number of pairs of cases observed and E was the expected number of pairs.",

Kulldorff's scan statistic is based on the number of observed cases among all births that have taken place within a circle of varying radius in space in one dimension and in a time window with a varying duration in the other dimension. The statistic is centred at all geographical locations to look for possible clusters. Thus, the circular window is flexible in location, size and time. For the analyses of clustering on the residential level, we used the geographical coordinates of the centre of the mothers\u2019 residential municipality. For the analyses of clustering at each delivery hospital, we used a purely temporal scan statistic, with a time window of varying duration. The number of observed cases in a cluster was compared to what would have been expected if the spatial and temporal locations of all cases were independent of each other, so that there was no space\u2013time interaction. As described by Kulldorff et al., the scan statistic makes minimal assumptions about the time, geographical location or size of the cluster and can be adjusted for both purely spatial and purely temporal variations 21.",

The results from the Knox test showed significant clustering during 1987\u20131997, but not during 1998\u20132009, which did not support an overestimation of clusters due to centralised care, as the centralisation of neonatal intensive care in Sweden has increased over the last few decades. The finding of a decrease in clustering over time could be related to improvements in the neonatal intensive care of preterm infants. In this study, it was not possible to analyse whether the decrease in clusters was related to improved control of infection in the NICU, less overcrowding, better routines in the NICU or other reasons for reduced transmission of NEC between patients.

These findings could indicate that the virus had its origin in the community and was then transmitted to the infants. The findings in the present study, in which the Knox test found no clustering on a residential level and Kulldorff's scan statistic found only one cluster, are strong indications against the theory that there is a connection between NEC and infections spread in the community. However, when studying the clusters on a hospital level with the Kulldorff\u2032s scan statistic, it was noticed that the majority of the clusters at a hospital level occurred during November to April, which is also the season when most infections in the community occur.
