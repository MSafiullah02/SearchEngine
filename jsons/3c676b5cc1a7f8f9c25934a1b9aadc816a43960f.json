Viral RNA was extracted using the viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); respiratory pathogens were detected using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits.

All 16 students had fever and diarrhea or abdominal pain, while the 10 canteen staff denied having any symptoms. The five environmental samples included two swabs from the chopping board and one swab each from the kitchen garbage bin, vegetable freezer room, and vegetable refrigerator room. Rotavirus, HAstV, adenovirus, and norovirus were examined using real-time RT-PCR kits (Jiangshu Shuoshi Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Taizhou, China). All specimens tested negative for rotavirus and adenovirus. Only one specimen from the canteen staff tested positive for norovirus. Thirteen specimens tested positive for HAstV, including specimens from six students and six canteen staff members and one swab from the chopping board.",

[1] The amplified products were sent to Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) for Sanger sequencing. Twelve nucleotide sequences of the HAstV capsid protein gene were obtained; these sequences were found to be 100% identical to each other. Finally, this isolate was named 0631/Wuzhou/Guangxi/2017; the sequence was submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession MH643741). The Evolutionary history was inferred using the neighborjoining method and the software program MEGA7. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on capsid protein gene sequences (348 bp) of the HAstV 1 to 8 subtypes isolated in the present study and the respective representative strains. HAstV-1 is classified into 6 lineages (HAstV-1 a-f), [5] and the isolate in this study belonged to the HAstV 1b lineage [ Figure 1B ]. Generally, HAstV strains of 1b lineage from the mainland of China can be divided into 2 groups: isolated before 2015 and isolated after 2015, based on the capsid protein gene sequence (348 bp). The current isolate was closely related to Hu/HAstV1/0603/2015/ Haerbin/CHN and was clustered with strains circulating in the mainland of China after 2015.",

Another limitation was that an insufficient number of clinical and environmental samples were collected for detection of bacterial pathogens. Our data highlight the possibility that HAstV infections not only include viral gastroenteritis-like symptoms but also influenza-like symptoms. Overall, the importance of HAstV infections occurring in middle school should not be neglected and hygiene-related conditions in middle schools should be improved to prevent HAstV outbreaks.",
