The connection is kept patent by the deployment of an expandable metal stent across it, so that some of the portal venous blood flow is shunted to the systemic circulation, thereby decreasing portal pressure and decreasing variceal bleeding. Several studies have shown that TIPS is very effective for refractory variceal hemorrhage. The TIPS is formed by passing a needle catheter via the transjugular route into the hepatic vein and wedging it there. The needle is then extruded into the liver parenchyma and attempts are made to find a branch of the intrahepatic portion of the portal vein. Figure 37 .1 shows the catheter in place in the portal vein. A series of balloon catheters are then used to dilate the tract from the hepatic vein to the portal vein ( Fig. 37. 2) and the stent, which is typically a 10-mm diameter covered wire mesh device, is inserted ( Fig. 37.3) .",

FAP is an autosomal dominant multisystemic fatal disorder, characterized by a progressive peripheral neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy with neural and systemic amyloid deposits. The disease is caused by a mutant gene on chromosome 18. The amyloid protein in type 1 FAP (the most common form) is the variant transthyretin in which methionine is a substitute for valine at position 30 (TTR Met 30). More than 90% of TTR Met 30 is produced by the liver. Amyloidosis is a generic term that refers to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of proteins, many of which circulate as a constituent of plasma. There are at least 25 different human protein precursors of amyloid fibrils known.",

Approximately 25-30% of patients with alcoholic hepatitis present with manifestations of portal hypertension (ascites, varices, encephalopathy), which may be a consequence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis or the result of transient portal venous obstruction from hepatic swelling. Up to 50% of patients presenting with acute alcoholic hepatitis will have underlying cirrhosis. The spectrum of alcoholic liver disease ranges from asymptomatic fatty liver to alcoholic hepatitis to decompensated cirrhosis. Fatty liver or hepatic steatosis is the most common form of alcoholic liver disease and is reversible with abstinence from alcohol intake. Its first clinical manifestation is typically asymptomatic hepatomegaly. As a consequence of preferential alcohol oxidation, the liver develops fatty deposition. Alcoholic fatty liver is rarely diagnosed clinically because most patients are asymptomatic and do not seek medical attention. However, up to 90% of alcoholics have steatosis. Fatty liver can occur within hours after a large alcohol binge. It represents a direct effect of ethanol and can occur despite an adequate nutritional state. The CT scan image ( Fig. 39.1 ), in this case, reveals an enlarged fatty liver (Hounsfield units of the liver are much lower when compared with the spleen; i.e., the liver is less dense, correlating with severe fatty infiltration).",

A small proportion of patients with hepatitis A experience relapsing hepatitis weeks to months after apparent recovery from acute infection. Relapses are characterized by recurrence of symptoms, aminotransferase elevations, occasionally jaundice, and fecal excretion of HAV. Another unusual variant of acute hepatitis A is cholestatic hepatitis, characterized by protracted cholestatic jaundice and pruritus.

At therapeutic doses, 90% of acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are then excreted in the urine. Approximately 2% is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remaining acetaminophen is metabolized via the hepatic cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase pathway to a toxic, highly reactive intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQ1). Appropriate acetaminophen doses produce a small amount of NAPQ1 which is rapidly conjugated with hepatic glutathione, forming nontoxic cysteine and mercaptate compounds that are excreted in the urine. However, with toxic doses of acetaminophen, the sulfation and glucuronidation pathways become saturated, and more acetaminophen is metabolized to NAPQ1 via cytochrome P450. When hepatic glutathione stores are depleted by approximately 75%, NAPQ1 begins to react with hepatocytes and leads to injury and necrosis. There is evidence that conditions that deplete stores of glutathione, such as malnutrition and a period of fasting may predispose patients to acetaminophen toxicity.",

The extreme elevations in iron studies seen in many cases of acute severe hepatitis can cause some confusion to the unseasoned clinician; however, these constitute a manifestation of hepatocellular damage and likely have no prognostic value. Moreover, hereditary hemochromatosis should never be on the differential of acute liver failure.",

A sclerotherapy needle is being used to inject a sclerosant into the varix and the bleeding stops. The patient has a known history of chronic hepatitis C infection. From his social history, it is likely that he had had the infection for more than 30 years, which increases the likelihood of advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis. About one-third of patients with varices experience variceal hemorrhage, and each episode of hemorrhage can have 20-30% mortality. In patients with acute variceal hemorrhage, diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy should be done emergently once patients are hemodynamically stable. Intravenous octreotide and antibiotics should be started promptly when variceal hemorrhage is suspected. Type I gastric varices (GOV I) are found along the lesser curve (usually 2-5 cm in length) which are potentially treatable with endoscopic band ligation therapy. Type II (GOV II) are found along the greater curve extending toward the fundus of stomach. Isolated gastric varices are found in the fundus (IGV I) or other parts of the stomach (IGV II). Band ligation is ineffective in GOV II and IGV. The AASLD guidelines for variceal hemorrhage recommend: Acute GI hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients is an emergency that requires prompt intravascular volume support and blood transfusions, being careful to maintain a hemoglobin of approximately 8 g/dl. Short-term (max. 7 days) antibiotic prophylaxis should be instituted in any patient with cirrhosis and GI hemorrhage with PO norfloxacin or IV ciprofloxacin. In patients with advanced cirrhosis, IV ceftriaxone (1 g/day) may be preferable, particularly in centers with a high prevalence of quinolone-resistant organisms. Pharmacological therapy (somatostatin or its analogues octreotide and vap-reotide; terlipressin) should be initiated as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected and continued for 3-5 days after the diagnosis is confirmed. EGD, performed within 12 h, should be used to make the diagnosis and to treat variceal hemorrhage either with band ligation or sclerotherapy. TIPS is indicated in patients in whom hemorrhage from esophageal varices can-not be controlled or in whom bleeding recurs despite combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy. Balloon tamponade should be used as a temporizing measure (max. 24 h) in patients with uncontrollable bleeding for whom a more definitive therapy (e.g., TIPS or endoscopic therapy is planned). For gastric varices, endoscopic variceal obturation using tissue adhesives such as cyanoacrylate is preferred, where available. Otherwise, EVL is an option. TIPS should be considered in patients in whom hemorrhage from fundal varices cannot be controlled or in whom bleeding recurs despite combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy.",

Precipitating factors should be reversed if present such as constipation, GI bleeding, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, infections, and medications, and worsening hepatic function. Lactulose should be titrated to 3-4 soft bowel movements daily. Protein restriction is generally not recommended. Other agents used include neomycin, metronidazole, and zinc although the data for their efficacy is limited. Recently, oral rifaximin has been shown to be effective but is very expensive in the US. As a last resort, the TIPS can be occluded or downsized, but this will very likely cause the ascites to reaccumulate.",

She has not been seen for some time, and we are not told her baseline bilirubin. However, she is coagulopathic, has an elevated white-cell count with abdominal tenderness in the setting of jaundice. She very likely has hepatic encephalopathy, but the question is what is the etiology? The main differential diagnosis is between alcoholic hepatitis and SBP, but the development of HCC or another infection is also possible. Apart from SBP, which is defined as infection in the ascitic fluid without evidence of an intraabdominal surgically treatable source, the possibility of secondary bacterial peritonitis (from a ruptured viscus -gallbladder, colon, or peptic ulcer) should be considered and abdominal imaging is advisable.",

Apart from the tap, blood cultures and a sepsis workup are warranted, and abdominal imaging with ultrasound would not be unreasonable.",

The diagnosis of SBP is made on a positive culture and an elevated absolute polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) cell count of >250 cells/mm 3 . A small amount of the fluid should be sent for chemistry to determine the albumin content. In this case, the difference between the serum albumin and ascites albumin (serum ascites albumin gradient or SAAG) was 1.4 g/dl, indicative of portal hypertension. Another 10 ml should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside (rather than sent to the laboratory in a syringe since this reduces the sensitivity). The gram stain can be ordered but has a very low sensitivity in determining if bacteria are present.",

The opposite variant is monomicrobial, nonneutrocytic bacterascites where the culture is positive but the PMN count is <250. Both should be treated as SBP, particularly if the clinical setting is convincing. It is also possible to get polymicrobial bacterascites from trauma to the bowel during paracentesis.",

The varices become thinner and disappear in the mid to distal esophagus. Downhill varices are a result of obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). When the SVC is obstructed superior to the azygous vein, venous blood is redirected downhill as it flows through the esophageal veins into the azygous vein. This results in development of downhill varices in the upper to mid esophagus. The most common etiologies of downhill varices are malignancies such as lung cancers and mediastinal tumors. Other potential etiologies include mediastinal fibrosis, substernal goiter, and trauma from central intravenous line placement. The patient may also have other signs of SVC obstruction such as dyspnea, dysphagia, facial and arm swelling, plethora, and headache. Because malignancy is the most common etiology, the prognosis from bleeding is often poor.",

The CT scan ( Fig. 59 .1) shows a lesion that does not enhance after contrast compatible with a treated lesion (arrowed). The liver is cirrhotic, and ascites is apparent. No biliary dilation is seen to suggest obstruction.The differential diagnosis includes anything that could cause decompensation in a cirrhotic patient such as infection, bleeding, acute alcohol, and medications. However, she looks well and has an undetectable alcohol level. Her enzymes argue against infection or a medication-induced effect. Her tumor could have recurred or perhaps she has developed another lesion at or near the hilum that is causing biliary obstruction but again her numbers and imaging do not correlate with this. The most likely explanation is worsening of her underlying liver disease due to TACE.Since the bulk of blood supply to HCCs comes from the hepatic artery, the principle behind TACE is to embolize or infuse chemotherapy directly into a hepatic artery branch that supplies the tumor. It is not surprising that some adjacent liver tissue suffers some ischemic damage.Indeed, some of the contraindications for TACE include situations where an added ischemic insult could push the patient into liver failure such as portal vein thrombosis, elevated bilirubin, high tumor volume, ascites, or high transaminases.Several large studies and meta-analyses have examined the incidence of complications after TACE and found the most common adverse effect, occurring in 60-80%, is a self-limiting postembolization syndrome that causes pain, fever, and a rise in liver enzymes. The rate of liver failure after TACE depends on the pretreatment liver function but can be as high as 20% and can be irreversible in 2-3%.",

The first image (Fig. 60.1) shows the gastric antrum where there is severe PHTG with hyperemic mucosa and diffuse oozing on contact with the scope. More proximally in the stomach, the second image demonstrates the \"chickenwire\" appearance of mild PHTG. Severe PHTG in the antrum can be confused with gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE or watermelon stomach). The latter is characterized by ecstatic mucosal blood vessels and is also seen in patients with cirrhosis. It can present in a similar manner with microcytic anemia but can be treated with cautery or argon plasma coagulation.PHTG typically is worse in the proximal stomach but can be present anywhere. Biopsy is usually not required to make a diagnosis. Increasing incidence or severity is not always the natural history in cirrhosis and the presence of PHTG is not related to age, sex, cause of cirrhosis, or grade of gastroesophageal varices. However, severe gastropathy is associated with an increase in portal venous pressure gradient and impaired liver metabolic activity. Interestingly, several studies have suggested that sclerotherapy or band ligation of esophageal varices increases the risk of developing portal hypertensive gastropathy.As with causes of bleeding in portal hypertension, PHTG can be treated by trying to decrease portal pressure through non-selective beta blockers, TIPS, shunt surgery or ultimately by liver transplant. TIPS appears to work quite well for this condition, but in my experience most patients seem to do well with iron supplementation and beta-blockade.",
