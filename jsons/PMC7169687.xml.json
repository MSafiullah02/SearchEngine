CPV is a small, non\u2010enveloped, single\u2010stranded DNA virus. Genome consists of an approximately 5,000\u2010nucleotide (nt) DNA molecule containing two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, encoding for two non\u2010structural (NS1 and NS2) and two structural (VP1 and VP2) proteins through alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2012; Reed, Jones, & Miller, 1988). VP2 is the major capsid protein, represents the major determinant of parvovirus host range (Hueffer et al., 2003) and is subjected to antibody\u2010mediated selection (Nelson, Palermo, Hafenstein, & Parrish, 2007). For this reason, most studies during the years have focused on the evolution of the VP2 gene, with limited works on the non\u2010structural genes (Hoelzer, Shackelton, Parrish, & Holmes, 2008).",

After its emergence, two CPV variants (CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b) rapidly replaced the original type 2 (Decaro et al., 2005; Parrish, O'Connell, Evermann, & Carmichael, 1985; Parrish et al., 1988, 1991). In 2000, a new antigenic type (CPV\u20102c), which showed amino acid (aa) Glu at VP2 residue 426, emerged in Italy (Buonavoglia et al., 2001), spreading in the last 15 years to many countries worldwide (Miranda & Thompson, 2016). Additional changes (Ser297Ala, Gly300Asp, Thr324Ile) in the VP2 sequence were also observed in strains detected in last decades (Ikeda et al., 2000; Jeoung, Ahn, & Kim, 2008; Truyen, 1999). Among these, a change at residue 324, first reported in 2006 (Zhou, Zeng, Zhang, & Li, 2017), may represent a common change in CPV strains circulating in the Asian continent (Geng et al., 2015). Recently, change Thr324Ile has been observed in European CPV\u20102a strains (Cs\u00e1gola, Varga, L\u0151rincz, & Tuboly, 2014). The aim of this work was to report the detection and genetic characterization of a CPV strain from a dog imported from Thailand to Italy.",

Whereas new CPV\u20102a/2b are prevalent strains circulating in Asia (Yi, Tong, Cheng, Song, & Cheng, 2016), CPV\u20102c has been sporadically detected in this continent. This variant has been detected in India in 2006 (Nandi, Chidri, Kumar, & Chauhan, 2010), in China from 2009 to 2015 (Geng et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010) and in Taiwan between 2014 and 2016 (Chiang, Wu, Chiou, Chang, & Lin, 2016). Our strain showed 100% nucleotide identity with complete VP2 sequence of 10 CPV strains detected in China in 2014 (Wang et al., 2016) and with partial VP2 sequence of 14 strains detected in China in years 2014\u20102015 (Geng et al., 2015) and with partial VP2 sequence of 6 viruses circulating in Vientiane, Laos, in 2016 (Vannamahaxay et al., 2017). Laos is located between China and Thailand, the latter being the country of origin of the infected dog. In the same country, a high prevalence of CPV strains closely related to Chinese isolates has been recently reported (Vannamahaxay et al., 2017). After the first report of CPV in Thailand (Tingpalapong et al., 1982), only CPV\u20102a/2b types have been proven to circulate in this country, with no evidence for the presence of the variant 2c (Phromnoi, Sirinarumitr, & Sirinarumitr, 2010). The findings of the present study suggest that CPV\u20102c is currently circulating in more Asian countries than previously reported, which deserves further extensive surveillance.",

            "text": "The presence of different nt and aa changes between European and Asian CPV strains and the presence of high genetic identities among Asian strains support the Asian origin of the CPV strain detected in the imported pup, thus representing the first evidence in Europe of a CPV\u20102c strain with Asian signatures. In addition, determining the nearly complete genome of this Asian\u2010like CPV contributes to gain new information about these Asian CPV strains for further studies. Trading and transport of dogs between countries and continents play an important role in introduction or re\u2010introduction of novel or re\u2010emerging viral strains, as already observed for other canine viruses (Decaro et al., 2007; Martella et al., 2006). Thus, this report represents the evidence for transcontinental viral spread. Future epidemiological survey and determination of complete genome sequences will allow to better trace the possible spread of CPV variants among countries and continents.",
