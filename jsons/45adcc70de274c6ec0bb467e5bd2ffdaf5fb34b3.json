This discussion has mostly focused on therapy-induced immune suppression. Here, we examined the expression patterns of ACE2, the receptor through which SARX-CoV2 enters human cells, and found that ACE2 mRNA levels are elevated in tumor-adjacent normal tissues of cancer patients, including in normal-adjacent lung tissues of lung cancer patients. These observations raise the possibility that the elevated COVID-19 risk of cancer patients may not be limited to those undergoing immune-suppressing treatment. 2. Liang W, Guan W, Chen R, et al.
