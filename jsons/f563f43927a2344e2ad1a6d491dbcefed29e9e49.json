            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are frequent among Hajj pilgrims. We conducted this study to describe the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens, their potential interactions and risk factors for possible lower respiratory tract infection symptoms (LRTI) among French pilgrims during the 2018 Hajj. Pilgrims from Marseille who were participating in the Hajj were recruited. Each participant underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs before and during their stay in Saudi Arabia. Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. Polymicrobial carriage was observed in 73.8% samples. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22, 95%CI [2.04-19.01]). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria.",

            "text": "Each year, an increasing number of people travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, which attract around 10 million pilgrims annually from more than 180 countries. More than two million pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia participated in the Hajj pilgrimages in 2017 [1] . Each year, about 2,000 pilgrims from Marseille, France, participate in the Hajj [2] . The event presents major challenges for public health, including inter-human transmission of infectious diseases, notably respiratory tract infections (RTIs), due the crowded conditions experienced by pilgrims [1] . In a recent study on morbidity and mortality among Indian Hajj pilgrims, infectious diseases represented 53% of outpatient diagnoses, with RTIs and gastroenteritis being the most common [3] . Between 69.8% and 86.8% of French pilgrims presented RTI symptoms during the Hajj [4] . A recent literature review suggested that etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is complex; several studies showed a significant acquisition of respiratory pathogens by pilgrims following participation in the Hajj in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [5] . In a systematic review of 31 studies, Al-Tawfiq et al. showed that human rhinovirus (HRV) and influenza viruses were the most common viral respiratory pathogens isolated from ill Hajj pilgrims [6] . In addition, human non-MERS coronaviruses (HCoV) were also a common cause of RTIs during the event [7] . On the other hand, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus were shown to be the most commonly acquired respiratory bacteria at the Hajj [5] .",

Nasopharyngeal colonisation is likely to be a reservoir for respiratory pathogens resulting in interhuman transmission between pilgrims during close contact experienced during the Hajj ritual. Furthermore, antibiotic use or vaccines, which target specific pathogen species, may alter polymicrobial interactions in the nasopharynx and have unanticipated consequences [12, 13] . To our knowledge, the dynamics and interaction between the main respiratory pathogens acquired during the Hajj pilgrimage have not been specifically investigated, to date.

Overcrowding during the event is thought to increase the risk of the transmission of infectious diseases, but interaction between respiratory pathogens is probably one factor contributing towards the development of RTIs. To our knowledge, no study on respiratory microbiota alteration among pilgrims during the Hajj has been conducted. Our results about the occurrence of RTI symptoms are in line with previous results obtained regarding French pilgrims [18] and others [1, 19] . Notably, we observed that RTI symptoms occur soon after the pilgrims' arrival in Mecca, with most symptoms starting between 4 to 13 days after arrival, corresponding to the period when pilgrims are stationed in Mecca hotels and are visiting the Grand Mosque daily, where highly crowded conditions are common [7] . We also confirmed that an overall increase in the carriage of respiratory viruses and bacteria can be seen when comparing pre-travel samples and post-Hajj samples, as previously documented [7, 12, [19] [20] [21] [22] . Higher acquisition rates were observed for rhinovirus with a ninefold increase when comparing pre-travel to post-Hajj carriage and for S. pneumoniae with a seven-fold increase, but an increase was observed for all pathogens tested in this study. The unique design of our study with sequential systematic sampling at regular intervals allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of pathogen carriage during the pilgrimage.",

These studies also underlined that rhinovirus infection may facilitate the propagation of S. aureus from staphylococcal carriers to the environment and the transmission of the bacterium between humans. Among healthy persons who were experimentally infected by rhinovirus, the relative abundance of S. aureus first increased and then returned to its baseline level after the rhinovirus infection was cleared [29] . These results suggest that changes in the composition of the respiratory microbiota following rhinovirus infection may play a role in the development of bacterial superinfection. Morgene et al. proposed several potential mechanisms through which rhinovirus may increase bacterial infection [30] .",

Potential adult participants were invited to participate in the study. They were included and followed-up by two bilingual (Arabic and French) medical doctors who travelled with the group. All participants departed to KSA on the same date, were housed in the same accommodation during their stay and performed the rituals together. Upon inclusion, before departing from France, pilgrims were interviewed using a standardised pre-Hajj questionnaire that collected information about demographic characteristics, medical history and immunisation status. Pilgrims were considered to have been immunised against influenza when they had been vaccinated within the past year and until before 10 days of the date of travel. Pilgrims were considered to be immune to IPD when they had been vaccinated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) in the past five years[14,15]. A post-Hajj questionnaire was completed two days before the pilgrims' return to France. Clinical data, antibiotic intake and information on compliance with face masks use as well as hand washing, the use of hand gel disinfectant and disposable handkerchiefs was collected. To evaluate the dynamic and interaction of respiratory pathogens during the Hajj, all pilgrims underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs at different times: pre-travel, five to six days post arrival, 12 to 13 days post arrival and just prior to leaving KSA (post-Hajj).
