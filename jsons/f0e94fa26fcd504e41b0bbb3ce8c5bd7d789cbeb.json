We aim to enhance the query recommendation experience for a commercial image search engine. Our proposed methodology incorporates current state-of-the-art practices from relevant literature -the use of generation-based sequence-to-sequence models that capture session context, and a multitask architecture that simultaneously optimizes the ranking of results. We extend this setup by driving the learning of such a model with captions of clicked images as the target, instead of using the subsequent query within the session. Since these captions tend to be linguistically richer, the reformulation mechanism can be seen as assistance to construct more descriptive queries. In addition, via the use of a pairwise loss for the secondary ranking task, we show that the generated reformulations are more diverse.",

There has been much progress allowing search engines to respond effectively even to short keyword queries on rare intents [5, 9, 25] . Despite this, recommendation of queries is an integral part of all search experiences -either in the form of query autocomplete (queries that match the prefix the user has currently typed into the search box) or query suggestions (reformulation options once an initial query has been provided). In this work, we focus on the query suggestion task. Original algorithms for this scenario relied on extracting co-occurrence patterns between query pairs, and their constituent terms, within historical logs [3, 12, 16, 18] . Such methods often work well for frequent queries. Recent work utilizing generative approaches common in natural language processing (NLP) scenarios offer generalization in terms of being able to provide suggestions even for rare queries [10, 21] . More specifically, the work by Sordoni et al. [26] focuses on generating query suggestions that are aware of the context of the user's current session. The current paper is most similar to this work in terms of motivation and the core technical component.",

As a result, it is useful to think of a search session as a series of interactions -where the user enters a query, examines and potentially interacts with the returned results, and constructs a refined query that is expected to more accurately represent their intent. Search engines therefore mine historical behavior of users on this query and similar ones in an attempt to optimize the entire search session [24] .",

[17] pointed out that successful reformulations, especially those involving changes to words and their order, can be identified as those that retrieve new items which are presented higher in the subsequent results. An automatic reformulation experience involves implementing lessons from such analyses. The first of these is the use of previous queries within the current search sessions to inform the subsequent suggestions -i.e., modeling the session context. Earlier papers (e.g. [7] ) explicitly captured co-occurrence within sessions which, while being an intuitive and simple strategy, had the disadvantage of not being able to account for rarer queries. Newer efforts (e.g. [21] ) therefore utilize distributed representations of terms and queries to help generalize to unseen queries.",

            "text": "Such efforts are part of a wider expansion of techniques originally common within NLP domains to Information Retrieval (IR) scenarios. Conceptually, a generation-based model for query reformulation is obtained by mapping a query to the subsequent one in the same session. Such a model incorporates two signals known to be useful from traditional IR: (1) sequence of terms within a query & (2) sequence of queries within a session. Recent papers have investigated models anchored in the original generic NLP settings but customized to the characteristics of search queries. For example, Dehghani et al. [11] suggest a 'copy' mechanism within the sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq) models [27] to allow for terms to be carried over across queries in the session. In the current paper, we consider the work of Sordoni et al. [26] as a reference for the core seqto-seq model. The model, referred to here as H ierarchical Recurrent E ncoder Decoder (HRED), is a standard encoder-decoder setup, where word embeddings are aggregated into a query representation, a sequence of which in turn leads to a session representation. A decoder for the hierarchically organized query and session encoders is trained to predict the sequence of query words that compose the subsequent query in the session. Along with being a strong baseline, it serves to illustrate the core components of our work: (a) use of a novel supervision signal in the form of captions of clicked results, and (b) jointly optimizing ranking along with query reformulation. These extensions could similarly be done with other seq-to-seq models used for query suggestion.",

The session encoder, which is modeled by a unidirectional LSTM [15] , updates the session context V qi S after each new V qi is presented to it. Figure 2 (b) illustrates one such update where the session encoding is updated to V qi S after V qi is provided as input to the session encoder by the query encoder. Since it is unreasonable to assume access to future queries in the session while generating a reformulation for the current query, we use a unidirectional LSTM to model the forward sequence of queries within a session. Accordingly, the session encoder updates its hidden state based on the forward pass over the query sequence. As shown in Fig. 2(b) , max-pooling is applied over each dimension of the hidden state to obtain the session encoding V qi S . Query Decoder: The generated session encoding V qi S is used as input by a query decoder to generate a reformulationq reform = {\u0175 1 , . . . ,\u0175 lr } for the query q i \u2208 S. As shown in Fig. 2(c) , the reformulation is generated word by word using a single layer unidirectional LSTM.
