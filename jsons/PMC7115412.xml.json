Researchers have identified crucial proteins of SARS-coronavirus and thousands of compounds are being screened in an effort to find new drugs [7], [20], [32]. Anand et al. [7] described a homology model of SARS coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro or 3CLpro) based on the experimental Mpro structures of human coronavirus (HCoV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) complex. Recently, the crystal structures of SARS CoV Mpro at different pH values were reported by Yang et al. [34]. The X-ray structures revealed some differences with the homology model obtained earlier [7]. However, experimental structure of SARS CoV Mpro folds in an arrangement that is similar to the HCoV and TGEV Mpro structures, and both homology model and experimental structure have a His\u2013Cys catalytic dyad between domains I and II [34]. The structures of the three coronavirus main proteinases reveal remarkable degree of conservation on the substrate-binding sites and form the structure basis for rational drug design [7], [20].",

[7] could well serve as a starting point to design efficient inhibitors for SARS CoV Mpro. AG7088 is a peptide inhibitor designed based on the structure of HCoV Mpro and is being clinically tested by Pfizer for the treatment of the human common cold. Chou et al. [20] have found some deficiency of AG7088 for binding to SARS CoV Mpro and suggested to use its derivative KZ7088 that could form better interactions with the active pocket of SARS CoV Mpro. Chou et al. also proposed an octapeptide inhibitor NH2\n\u2014AVLQ\u2193SGFR\u2014COOH (the cleavage site is indicated by \u2193) based on molecular modelling. This suggestion was supported by the recent work of Yang et al. [34]. In their structural determination, these authors used a decade peptide NH2\n\u2014TSAVLQ\u2193SGFR\u2014COOH, which is quite similar to the octapeptide NH2\n\u2014AVLQ\u2193SGFR\u2014COOH. According to a very recent report by Gan et al. [23], the octapeptide originally proposed by Chou et al. [20] has been synthesized and tested as the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS coronavirus compared with other compounds reported. Moreover, it has been found that the octapeptide had no toxicity in vivo under the physiological concentration [23].",

However, one needs to make some further chemical modification for the octapeptide in order to stabilize its inhibition power to SARS CoV Mpro and make it become an effective drug. This may be realized based on the \u201cdistorted key\u201d theory [12], [13]. To reach such a goal, a detailed understanding of the cleavage mechanism of the octapeptide by SARS CoV Mpro as well as the 3D structure of the enzyme is essential. Similar strategies have been used to investigate Cdk5\u2013Nc5a*\u2013ATP complex [19], [36], apoptosis proteins [10], [11], [15], [17], and beta-secretase zymogen [14]. Many useful insights have been gained through these studies. Accordingly, it is expected that the present study may also provide useful insights for the development of anti SARS drug.",

In Fig. 1b, however, the scissile peptide bond is replaced by a strong \u201chybrid peptide bond\u201d between R1 and R1\u2032 through a chemical modification, and the enhanced chemical bond become not cleavable by the protease. According to the \u201cdistorted key\u201d theory [12], a cleavable octapeptide can be likened to a key that fits well in binding to the protease active region leading to a cleavage at its scissile bond. The octapeptide after some chemical modification can still bind to the active region but its peptide bond can no longer be cleaved by the protease. Thus, the modified octapeptide can be vividly compared to a \u201cdistorted key\u201d that can be inserted into a lock but that can neither open it nor be easily pulled out from the lock [12]. In view of this, the modified octapeptide naturally becomes a stable competitive inhibitor and a potential candidate of drug.",

The study is performed in the following four steps: (1) using molecular mechanics to minimize the energy of the SARS CoV Mpro complex with the octapeptide from the basis derived from docking studies; (2) computing the atomic charge distribution around the binding pocket of SARS CoV Mpro using ab initio quantum mechanics and the minimizing conformational energy; (3) computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the octapeptide in the background charge distribution [24] of SARS CoV Mpro using ab initio quantum mechanics; and (4) in the same background charge distribution, computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the modified octapeptide.",

Twenty-five docking structures were obtained, and the one with the most optimal docking score was used for further energy minimization. Fig. 2\nshows the energy-refined docked structure obtained by the aforementioned step 1. In contrast to the common serine proteases that have a Ser\u2013His\u2013Asp catalytic triad, SARS CoV Mpro has a His\u2013Cys catalytic dyad (His-41 and Cys-145), which is similar to TGEV Mpro (His-41 and Cys-144) and HCoV Mpro (His-41 and Cys-144) [7], [29]. According to Chou et al. [20], the catalytic active region is located within the pocket between domain I and II of SARS coronavirus main protease that contains the following 23 amino acid residues: Cys-22, Gly-23, Thr-24, Thr-25, Leu-27, His-41, Val-42, Cys-44, Thr-45, Ala-46, Glu-47, Asp-48, Met-49, Leu-50, Asn-51, Pro-52, Tyr-54, Cys-145, His-164, Met-165, Asp-187, Arg-188, and Gln-189. Fig. 3\na shows the location of catalytic dyad His-41 and Cys-145 in SARS CoV Mpro. The active cleft of SARS CoV Mpro can well accommodates the octapeptide, and the ligand binds to the receptor through six hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3b), fully in consistent with the results reported by Chou et al. [20].",

In Fig. 5, the grey bold line is the 0-value line that means the electronic densities in gaseous phase and in protease background charges are unchanged. The solid thin lines show the regions where the electron densities are greater in SARS CoV Mpro background charges than in gaseous phase and the dashed thin lines show the areas where the electron densities are smaller in protease background charges than in gaseous phase. We find that along the peptide bond between (Gln)C\u2013N(Ser) the electron densities increase on N(Ser) side and decrease on (Gln)C side. This change is favorable for the neucleophilic attack of anion OH\u2212 on (Gln)C and electrophilic attack of cation H+ on N(Ser).",

If we replace the carboxyl group CO of glutamine on subsite R1 to CH2 or CF2 group, the \u03c0-bond system is broken and the modified octapeptide AVLQSGFR [20] may become a competent inhibitor for SARS CoV Mpro and an effective drug candidate against SARS.

Even limited in the range of octapeptides, it is by no means easy to answer the question. It would be exhausting to experimentally test out such a huge number of possible octapeptides. A good cleavable octapeptide could be found by using some existing prediction algorithms, such as discriminant function algorithm [12], [18], vectorized sequence-coupled algorithm [13], and some other relevant algorithms [8], [9], [35].

For example, if we know a protein consisting of 129 amino acid residues is not cleavable by SARS CoV Mpro, we can get 122 = 129 \u2212 7 non cleavable octapeptides immediately.
