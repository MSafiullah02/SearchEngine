To avoid a larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the numerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.",

Usually, the viruses cause respiratory infections among people and the first identification is in the 1960s [1] . The main transmission of coronavirus is like other viruses: through sneezing, coughing, coming into contact with the infected people, or touching daily-used items [2] . On December 26, 2019, the first detected novel coronary pneumonia case in China was reported as an unknown etiology pneumonia in Wuhan. Evidences pointing to the human-to-human transmission in hospitals and families are found in retrospective studies [3] [4] [5] [6] . It takes a few days to arouse people's attention and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) isolated the first strain of the causative virus (2019-nCoV) successfully on January 7, 2020. With Chinese New Year migration, the large epidemics occur in China and spread to many countries rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) declares that the pneumonia outbreak caused by 2019-nCoV as a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020 [7] . WHO has announced the official name of the disease caused by a novel coronavirus as COVID-19 [7] on February 11, 2020 , it is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans [8] . As of February 19, 2020, there have been 74576 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 2118 deaths in China, there are about 30 countries around the world reported over 1000 diagnosed cases.",

Although people have identified and analyzed the coronavirus for a long time, knowledge of the coronavirus is quite limited and there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Last major outbreak in China was SARS which is an acute respiratory infectious disease with high fatality rate caused by SARS-CoV in 2003. Chinese people managed the outbreak of SARS through multiple control and prevention measures effectively. Compared with SARS, the incubation period of COVID-19 is significant and rather long. Different mean incubation period of COVID-19 is reported, 5.2 days [9] in the early stage, 3.0 days [10] and 4.75 days [11] in recent research. The patient with up to 24 days of incubation period is reported in [10] , even 38 days is also reported in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hubei Province. Notice that there is quite a lot of people infected with asymptomatic [6] and the fatality is much lower than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [10] . Genetic studies of viruses show that the homology of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV is 85% [12] . But 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S [13] . By the end of January 29, 2020, the confirmed cases caused by COVID-19 are surpassed SARS. The uncertain of incubation period, asymptomatic cases and super transmissibility of the virus bring great difficulties in epidemic control.",

The travel related risks of disease spreading is evaluated in [15] , which indicates the potential of domestic and global outbreak [3] . The travel restriction effect are also discussed by means of the simulation result for Beijing, it shows that with travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14%, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction. A Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People network is developed in [16] for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection and the analytic form of basic reproduction number for a simplified Reservoir-People network is calculated. Ming et al. [17] apply a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU). The estimation suggests that assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions are implemented, the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported. Chen et al.

In order to avoid the situation worsening, Chinese government has pursued the most strictest isolation strategy for all people throughout the country to restrict the population mobility. Traffic control, limitation of travel, extension of the Chinese New Year vacations, delay to return to work, rigorous management of communities and even the wartime management ensure the susceptible population stay at home. At this stage, the main aim of the disease control is called 'the prevention of disease spreading inside'. The proposed model mainly focuses on the home quarantine strategy. It requires people to stay at home for at least 14 days, which is aiming at reduce the chance of contact with the infected people as much as possible. The asymptomatic transmission and isolation treatment policy are also taking into account in this paper. We use the official data published by China CDC and employ a Least-Squares procedure to estimate the parameters. We simulate the cases of most provinces in China, calculate the control reproduction number (R 0 c ) for each selected provinces. To capture the variation of effective control reproduction number (R c (t)), we divide the control process into three periods, calculate the average of R c (t) for each stage and compare the results inside and outside Hubei province. The numerical results show that the intervention and support strategy carried out by the government decreases R c (t) quickly. Chinese government provide free medical care for the diagnostic COVID-19 patient. Furthermore, as of 24:00 on February 14, 217 medical teams (military medical teams are not included) including 25633 team members have arrived Hubei from all over China. It relieved the medical pressures of Hubei Province greatly. We estimate the disease burden by means of accumulated medical resource needed in 90 days, the peak value and peak time of the diagnostic population are also given in the numerical simulation part.",

It has pointed out that high temperature will weaken the activity of SARS-CoV [21] . Spring is coming in China, the meteorological factors, such as temperature and humidity, is changing. To clarify the relationship between the meteorological condition and the transmission of COVID-19, we obtain the weather data from China Meteorological Data Service Center (CMDC) and define a comprehensive meteorological index M eI. The outbreak of COVID-19 coincides with Chinese New Year Migration, based on the migration level, we separate all the selected provinces into two groups. The correlation analysis shows that for the spread rate are significantly associated with M eI in each group. The air index plays an important but interesting role, it is a positive factor in the low-migration group, but negative in the high-migration group. The high relative humidity helps to control the spread of COVID-19 for both groups.",

It results in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei Province. Due to the different circumstance inside and outside Hubei Province, the estimation and prediction are investigated for the two cases. Notice that, the spread of COVID-19 is very strong, it may cause twice outbreak without effective control. Zhong declares that, the disease may be controlled well by the end of April [25] under our powerful control strategy, we take parameter 1/\u03bb as 90 days. Based on the procedure in Section 2.2, the corresponding parameter \u03b2 and \u03b3 I are given. The results of inside and outside Hubei province are presented in Figure 2 , the blue solid line shows the fit based on current circumstances and the trends until the end of April are shown. Asterisks represent the D pub . All the other parameters, initial values and the corresponding R 0 c for inside and outside of Hubei Province can be seen in Tabel 1. We find that the R 0 c outside Hubei is much higher than it in inside Hubei. This is mainly caused by the huge total size of Chinese population, it represent the initial situation in a way. To evaluate the strictest isolation strategy, we calculate the average R c (t) for three stages and show them in Table 2 . We can clearly see that the values of the average R c (t) decrease quickly under current control strategy. It almost down to 1 in metaphase outside Hubei Province and below 1 now. The situation in Hubei Province is more complex, though the average R c (t) decreases sharply, it is still greater than 1 in anaphase. The disease isn't under control completely, it still has a high risk of sustainable spread. Specific medicine and effective vaccine are absent till now, the strictest isolation strategy makes great contribution to the prevention of the disease spread, it needs to persist in. To make a better illustration of quarantine strategy, we test different home quarantine period (1/\u03bb) in Figure 2 . The corresponding peak value, peak time of D(t) and the accumulated medical resource needed in 90 days by AM R which defined in (2.5) are listed in Table 3 . In Figure 2 , the colorful dashed lines show that if the quarantine period isn't long enough, the isolation strategy can not work well. There needs a longer quarantine period in Hubei Province than outside. The longer quarantine period, the earlier peak time of D(t) comes. Unlike normal infectious disease, the ward for COVID-19 is particular. To avoid nosocomial infection, it requires maximal barrier precautions in the hospital and there are quite a few critically ill patient in ICU. Our medical system is facing the huge challenges caused by patients shoot up rapidly, especially the peak value of D(t). The study of the maximum capacity to deal with the emergency is necessary for disease control. In the simulation, the peak time of D(t) in outside Hubei is on February 12, 2020 and inside Hubei is February 24, 2020, which is in line with the actual data (the last line in Table 3 ). By adjust the parameter \u03bb, we find that, if we fix the quarantine period as 30 days, both the peak value and AM R are more than triple as now inside Hubei. Particularly, the peak time won't reach in three months in Hubei. The situation outside Hubei is not much better than that in Hubei. The peak time delays a week, though the peak value isn't increase much, the AM R almost doubled. More details of shorter quarantine period can be seen in Table 3 . Notice that, in shorter quarantine period (5, 10 and 20 days), T peak seems proportional to 1/\u03bb. It is mainly caused by a large amount of infected people, that is, the disease almost infected every susceptible person. The medical burden in shorter quarantine period situation is horrible. Above study gives an intuitionistic understanding of COVID-19 in China. According to the different characters in each province, we study the transmission and control strategy of COVID-19 more intensively. The simulation for other provinces are shown in Figure 3 with blue solid lines. Colorful dashed lines represent the trends of D(t) under different quarantine period. All the parameters are shown in Appendix Table 8 and Table 9 . The peak value, peak time of D(t) for each province under different \u03bb can be found in Appendix Table 7 . Our model fit the published data accurately for most of the provinces. We estimate the R 0 c for each province and plot the distribution heat map in Figure 4 , the initial situation for each province is serious. If the control strategy is insufficient, the disease will out of control in each province. Back to the strictest isolation strategy, up to February 19, 2020, the disease is in the decline phase for most provinces, it is effective for controlling the transmission of COVID-19. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Heilongjiang should pay more attention, they are in the key period of the disease control. The home quarantine period in most province can be much shorter than Hubei and the disease can also be controlled well. From Figure 3 , we find that, the trends of D(t) between 30 days and 60 days quarantine period are roughly the same, such as GanSu, Yunnan, Tianjin and so on. Considering the need of daily production, the workers of these provinces can return to work actively and orderly. The medical resources in each province are distributed unevenly. After the disease outbreak, the government deployed medical resources to rescue Hubei Province. We estimate the AM R needed for each provinces by integrating D(t) from 0 (Jan 23) to 90 (Apr 22) days under different quarantine period (5 \u2212 60 days). The detail parameter values and corresponding AM R in 90 days are shown in Table 7 . We collect the number of 3A hospital in each province, which can reflect the level of medical resources. In Table 4 , we show the 3A hospital (N 3 ) number in each province, the medical burden (M B) is measured by",

In this case, the probability of contact with infected people is increased. In low M iI group, the bad air condition will aggravate the spread. The impact of wind power in both group has similar pattern. Bad air condition and strong wind suggests that, people should pay more attention to the personal protection.

It is said that the first vaccine has produced antibodies and the process is in the animal experiment [29] . The director-general of WHO said that there are more than 20 COVID-19 vaccines candidates are currently in development phase and some new treatment are in clinical trials, the results will be expected within a few weeks [30] . The progress of the development of vaccines is much quicker than expected. If the new vaccine of COVID-19 comes into service, it will be great benefit for the disease control. Considering the strictest isolation strategy, from the mathematical point of view, the process of the strategy is just like a short-time vaccine for susceptible population. The effect of stay away from the source of infection is equal to contact with infected people but doesn't get infected. After a little modification on model (2.1), it can describe the impact of the vaccine, by changing the quarantine compartment Q into the vaccine compartment V and setting parameter p as the vaccination rate, 1/\u03bb as the mean protection period of the new vaccine.",

In this section, we show the effect of different starting time we begin to use vaccine inside and outside Hubei Province. Considering the three control phases we defined, we take the starting day on January 28 (prophase), February 2 (metaphase) and February 12 (anaphase). We assume the average vaccination period is five year, it means \u03bb = 1/1825. We test different parameter p to present the impact of vaccination efficiency, the corresponding numerical results are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 . In the area of outside Hubei Province, we take the parameter p as 1/3 and 1/7 to compare with current control strategy (p = 1/3). We find that the application of vaccine accelerates the epidemic process, bring the peak forward and reduce total amount of diagnostic population. The trends of R c (t) with vaccine are much lower than that in current strategy. In the simulation inside Hubei, we take p as 1/7 and 1/14, which is smaller than optimal simulation (p = 1/6.2). Totally speaking, the effect will be better as the parameter p increases. The vaccination strategy does an excellent job of reducing R c (t) and effective action of taking the vaccine immunity is very important to prevent the growth of diagnostic population. Both inside and outside Hubei, the control of disease in prophase should be paid more attention. If the parameter p is smaller than that in isolation strategy, the peak value of D(t) will be greater than current situation. It means that, in the prophase of control, it is suitable for taking both vaccination and isolation strategy into account. Compared with isolation strategy ,vaccination strategy is more convenience for our daily life and the effect persist long.",

Although the control reproduction number R 0 c is high, the effective control reproduction number R c (t) decreases sharply under intervention. R c (t) of outside Hubei down to the critical value on February 2, 2020, and in our simulation the value will maintain about 0.6 (see Figure 6b ). In Hubei Province, R c (t) reaches 1 on February 13, 2020, we can see that it is a continued momentum of decline (see Figure 7b ). To have a better understanding of the isolation strategy, we simulate for each selected provinces, the goodness of fit shows that the proposed model is suitable to describe the situation of control in China. We find that if the isolation period isn't long enough, the strategy won't work. In Hubei Province, the quarantine period is simulated as 90 days, our result coincide with Zhong's study [25] . That is, the control period we suggest in Hubei is from January to the end of April. In the area outside Hubei, the trends of COVID-19 in most provinces between 30 days and 60 days isolation period are similar. Under careful personal protection, the people can return to their work actively and orderly in these provinces.",

An index called AM R is well defined to measure the needs of medical resources. Sufficient medical resources is the basic of the disease control. So it is necessary to assign medical resources to deal with the shocks caused by booming demand of patients. To study the detail situation of each province, AM R and original medical power are both considered. We find that, the set up of designated hospital decreases the medical burden sharply. It has released the pressure of diagnosis and isolation in each provinces. But the situation of Hubei is crisis, the disease burden is still huge. Medical workers and materials are transferred to Hubei from other provinces to ensure the control of COVID-19.",
