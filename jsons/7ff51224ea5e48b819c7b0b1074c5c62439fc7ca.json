Respiratory secretions were collected and the presence of different viruses and atypical bacteria analyzed by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction.Results: Two hundred nine patients (118 females) aged (mean AE SD) 4.4 AE 4 years were included. A potential causative agent was detected in 78% of the patients. The most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (n \u00bc 85; 40%) and rhinovirus (HRV) (n \u00bc 52; 24.5%); M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were detected in 4.5% and 2% of the cases, respectively. Patients with HRSV (vs. HRV) were hospitalized for a longer time (6.7 vs. 5.2 days, P \u00bc 0.012), required more days of oxygen supply (5.1 vs. 3.4, P \u00bc 0.005), had a longer duration of the exacerbation before hospitalization (3.6 vs. 1.9 days, P \u00bc 0.001) and were younger (3.7 vs. 5.1 years, P \u00bc 0.012). Three peaks of admissions were observed. A first peak (early autumn) caused by HRV, a second peak (winter) caused mainly by HRSV and a third one (spring), caused by HRSV, an increase in HMPV together with a second outbreak of HRV.

Infections associated with respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria are the main cause of asthma exacerbation. About 85-90% of the wheezing episodes in infants and 65-70% in children and adolescents are triggered by respiratory viruses. 3 Various viral agents, including the respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), influenza A and B (FLUAV and FLUBV), parainfluenza (HPIV), adenovirus (HAdV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (HEV), coronavirus (HCoV), and the recently described metapneumovirus (HMPV) 4 and bocavirus (HBoV) 5 have been detected in patients presenting with asthma exacerbation. While HRSV is the main agent associated with wheezing in infants and preschool children HRV is the most-frequent agent 1 detected in school children, adolescents, and adults. 3 Infections caused by atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) have been associated not only with asthmatic exacerbations but also with the development of chronic infections that may contribute to the persistence and severity of asthma. 6, 7 Numerous adequately treated asthmatic patients continue to experience wheezing episodes, so studies are necessary to understand the relationship between the inflammatory process triggered by various infectious agents and the events that lead to the loss of asthma control. 8, 9 This knowledge will assist the development of prevention and treatment strategies to help decrease the morbidity caused by bronchial asthma.

This finding supports previous observations that HRSV can cause acute exacerbations of chronic diseases at any age. 20 Community-based studies in school children 21 have found that HRV is the most prevalent virus, responsible for up to 70% of the asthma exacerbations. In our study, we detected HRV in 25% of the patients. This difference could be that our patients were not only hospitalized, but also younger. Some concerns could be regarded about the sample size that could lack sufficient statistical power, specially in smaller subgroups of analysis. However, several differences between groups reached statistical significance. Patients with exacerbations caused by HRV had a significantly shorter number of days from the beginning of the respiratory symptoms to hospital admission, and also shorter hospitalization and less oxygen requirement days than those with exacerbations caused by HRSV. Although the children affected by HRV were older and thus could be expected to have a wider airway caliber, this difference may be because the exacerbations triggered by HRV show a better response to treatment than those triggered by other respiratory viruses due to different pathogenic mechanisms of airway obstruction. 22 Thus, it was not possible to determine if the difference in clinical outcome observed might be related to the age of the patients' group or to the different pathogenic mechanisms of HRV and HRSV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 279, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 323, "end": 325, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1386, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In our cohorting, other common respiratory viruses, such as FLUV, HBoV, HCoV, HMPV, and HPIV, exhibited a much lower prevalence than HRSV and HRV. It is well known that FLUV triggers asthma exacerbations less frequently than other respiratory viruses. 23 Due to its frequent presence in co-detection and its long period of excretion after an active infection, the role of HBoV as a causative agent of asthmatic exacerbations requires further studies. The detection of HMPV, HCoV, HPIV, and HAdV, while higher in infants and school children, was significantly lower than that of HRSV and HRV. 24 In asthmatic hospitalized children, studies have reported prevalence of 20% for M. pneumoniae and 5-15% for C. pneumoniae, 25 which is higher than that found by our group (4.5% for M. pneumoniae and 2% for C. pneumoniae). This difference may be due to a lower circulation of these agents during the year in which the study was performed or to a lower detection rate, as we did not use serological methods. Another possible explanation could be the preponderance of young children sampled, as M. pneumoniae is usually less frequent under 4 years of age than in school age children. Therefore, treatment with macrolides is not justified in all patients presenting an asthma exacerbation but should be considered in children presenting persistent symptoms that cannot be controlled with conventional treatment. 26 In almost a quarter of patients (22%) we found evidence of a co-detection between respiratory viruses and/or atypical bacteria. We did not find significant differences when analyzing the occurrence of co-detections between the different agents involved and the hospitalization or Pediatric Pulmonology oxygen requirement days and the development of complications. 27, 28 However, the presence of such a high index of co-detection points to the need to revise the concept of ''cohortization'' or grouping patients in hospital rooms. Co-detections in which any of the viral agents recently described is involved can favor the development of nosocomial infections. 29 Although previously described in other regions of the world, to our best knowledge, this is the first report of respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria associated to wheezing in children described in the southern cone of America. In the near future, when antiviral therapies become more readily available, to know the regional patterns of circulation of viral agents might be useful to treat specific viral respiratory infections, helping to prevent asthmatic exacerbations.
