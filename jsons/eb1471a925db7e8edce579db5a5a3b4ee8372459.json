Reliable detection and identification of HRSV subgroup A and B infections are essential for accurate disease burden estimates in anticipation of licensure of novel HRSV vaccines and immunotherapies. To ensure continued reliability, molecular assays must remain current with evolving virus strains. We have developed a HRSV subgroup-specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detection and subgroup identification using primers and subgroup-specific probes targeting a conserved region of the nucleoprotein gene combined in a single duplex reaction using all genome sequence data currently available in GenBank. The assay was validated for analytical sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and clinical performance with a geographically diverse collection of viral isolates and respiratory specimens in direct comparison with an established pan-HRSV rRT-PCR reference test. The assay was sensitive, reproducibly detecting as few as 5-10 copies/reaction of target RNA. The assay was specific, showing no amplification with a panel of 16 other common respiratory pathogens or predicted by in silico primer/probe analysis.

Given their inherent design advantages and wide general use, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for HRSV that both detect and discriminate between the two HRSV subgroups are available (Kuypers et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2016; Perkins et al., 2005; van Elden et al., 2003) .

To remain viable, molecular assays must \"evolve\" with the pathogen. Instructive of this, Kamau et al. (2017) recently described their failure to detect HRSV among some immunofluorescence assay (IFA) positive specimens using a widely used multiplex respiratory pathogen rRT-PCR assay (Gunson et al., 2005) that acquired HRSV primer/probe sequences from an assay reported in 2003 by van Elden et al.

The investigation revealed that the IFA-positive-rRT-PCR-negative samples collected during 2014/ 15 and 2015/16 HRSV epidemic seasons in Kilifi, Kenya, contained a new HRSV B strain with polymorphisms in the rRT-PCR probe region that hindered annealing. The authors noted that failure to detect these strains could have adversely affected studies that used this assay (Anderson et al., 2013; Choudhary et al., 2013; Gimferrer et al., 2015) .
