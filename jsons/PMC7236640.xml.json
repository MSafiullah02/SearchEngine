It has now spread to other provinces of China. Liu et al. [1] carefully examined the important characteristics of the disease transmission patterns among the population of different age-groups.",

Till now (14 April 2020), there is no specific treatment or vaccine or drug for the disease caused by the COVID-19. The outbreak of infections due to COVID-19 is pushing many countries and regions around the World to take harsh policies, improve medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks, sanitizations etc.) for protection of people. It has resulted more than 1 lakhs deaths of people of different age groups. However, it has been proven that on the basis of the common signs or symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, patients are being treated (the drug named Hydroxychloroquine is useful) based on the patients\u2019 health/clinical conditions. Moreover, a highly supportive care for infected persons is highly effective. WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency and encouraged to continue strengthening and improving their preparedness for health emergencies against COVID-19.",

India further suspended all type of tourist visas because it was found that a majority of the cases were linked to other countries like Spain, Italy, Indonesia etc. On 22 March 2020, India announced a 14-h public curfew. Further, on 24 March 2020, the Prime Minister Shree Narendra Modi ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days (till 14 April 2020).

Big data, data mining, machine learning and several other technologies can be used to analyze data quickly and effectively for tracking and controlling the spread of COVID-19 around the world [2\u20135]. Big data became nowadays a thrust area for researchers, engineers, health managers and administrators [6]. Several researchers exploited data mining techniques widely which detects hidden information from big data [7, 8]. The results obtained from the study by Liu et al.

There is no prior assumption required for this technique and the clustering is done on the basis of similarities within the data set. The ward method is the simplest and the most commonly used method that uses the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate distances between clusters [16]. It has been found an efficient method of data analysis by several authors in case of a large number of data set.
