Regarding the use of topical nasal corticosteroids, current evidence shows no harm, and its use can be continued in patients who were already using this medication chronically. However, due to the lack of conclusive studies on COVID-19 and extrapolating the consequences of systemic corticosteroid treatment, the ABR advises that the chronic use of topical nasal corticosteroids be maintained and continue to be indicated, and in the occurrence of fever or other symptoms suggestive of flu, the physician may consider its temporary discontinuation. As for the use of topical nasal corticosteroids in acute viral infections, there are conflicting recommendations from the American (2016) and European (2020) guidelines; therefore, the ABR advises that the use of topical nasal corticosteroids in acute viral conditions should be avoided in the context of COVID-19. The ABR recommends not performing nasal or nasal sinus surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In cases of urgent or extremely necessary surgery, we suggest performing a test to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 with another test 24 hours later. In patients with COVID-19 or when it is impossible to perform the test, the use of a of surgical gown with personal protective equipment (PPE) and powered air-purifying respirator is recommended. On March 20, 2020, the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine (Conselho Federal de Medicina, CFM, in Portuguese) recommended canceling appointments, examinations, and elective surgical procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CFM also warned that if it is not possible to cancel the procedures, the physicians can perform them provided that they comply with the determinations of the local authorities and technical director of the service, as well complying witg the recommended hygiene, individual protection, and contact restriction protocols.\n6\n",

As the pandemic progresses, there will come a point when channeling a large amount of resources to an individual patient will be in direct conflict with the greater social good. If an oncology patient with late-stage disease or with comorbid health conditions such as heart or lung dysfunction acquires COVID-19 and requires mechanical ventilation, the prognosis is likely to be very poor. According to a recent retrospective study from Wuhan, China, only 1 one patient survived among 32 who were seriously ill with confirmed COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation.\n8\nThus, we believe it is imperative to have proactive end-of-life and palliative care discussions with cancer patients who may become infected with COVID-19. Although these practices should be a part of routine oncology care, such discussions with all cancer patients have become even more vital in these times. It is our duty to not only educate but also provide resources to help patients make decisions regarding treatment during this period of uncertainty. With dwindling resources, oncologists must also consider carefully what treatments are most likely to be successful, symptom-relieving, or lifesaving, and consider those patients likely to get the greatest benefit from treatments. Proactive discussions surrounding these challenging decisions should occur among disease-specific groups, medical ethicists, and palliative care teams.\n9\n",
