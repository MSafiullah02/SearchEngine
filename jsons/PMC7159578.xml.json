The technique behind MS dates back about a hundred years, when people like Thomson and Aston were amongst the first to separate particles of different mass to charge ratios (m/z), discovering isotopes of rare gases and other elements. For half a century, MS remained primarily in the hands of physicists, and often shrouded in secrecy, as it was also used to enrich uranium for the Manhattan project.1 Around the 1960s, the technique began to be adopted by chemists, for instance working in the petroleum industry, to investigate the chemical nature of the compounds formed in refinement processes. In the domain of chemistry, MS subsequently came to bloom particularly in the chemical analysis of unknown compounds (assisted by the coupling to separation technologies, such as gas and liquid chromatography) and as a research area by itself, termed organic MS, concerned with studying structures and fragmentation mechanisms of ions, and ion\u2013molecule reactions.2\n",

Another problem is posed by the transient nature of the intermediates formed during assembly and/or maturation impeding their purification and analysis.26 Although virus structure, dynamics, and assembly has been studied for decades, in recent years MS has entered this area of research and tackled several important questions that were less accessible by other means.27 Proteomics approaches were early on used to study the \u201cnew\u201d SARS virus,28 but MS is also an emerging method to reveal the constituents of a virus, the stoichiometry of the viral structural proteins, virus assembly and the corresponding intermediates.27 After introducing briefly a few general concepts in structural virology, we describe how modern MS can assist in virus characterization, especially focusing on structural aspects.",

Next, the protein and nucleic acid machinery of the cell is taken over to produce the viral constituents, finally comes the assembly and release of the infectious virus. After successful attachment to the host cell, the nucleocapsid can enter the cytosol by various mechanisms (Figure 2), such as, membrane fusion or phagocytosis often used by eukaryotic viruses.37, 49, 50 Bacteriophages generally inject their genome directly into the cell,51, 52 whereas most other viruses release the genome from the capsid at the pore complexes of the cell nucleus.53 An exception are (+)ssRNA viruses, which also uncoat in the cytoplasm, but replicate their genome outside the nucleus in close proximity to the membrane.54 Some viruses are incorporated metastably into the host genome, for example retroviruses and lysogenic phages. Replication of such proviruses is then induced spontaneously or after a specific trigger.55\u201357 Generally following infection, viruses take control of the host\u2010cell machineries to facilitate their own replication.58 At late stages of infection, the structural proteins either assemble around new copies of nucleic acid or assemble independently and package the nucleic acid afterwards.59\u201361 Eventually, mature virions are released by budding like vesicles or the cell can rupture as a consequence of the viral load.62, 63 The virus can then spread and infect new cells, reinitiating the cycle. Also multiple ways of replication occur during the lifecycle of different viruses, an important step is usually maturation, signaling complete assembly of infectious particles that are ready for release. This process includes a variety of biochemical adaptations such as conformational changes triggered by the nucleic acid incorporated, attachment of auxiliary proteins, or protein posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, proteolysis, and cross\u2010linking.64\u201368 Viruses represent a strong selective pressure on the host. Resistant cells have an evolutionary advantage by increased viability. As a consequence, viruses evolve by constantly altering their genome. RNA viruses, in particular, often show a high mutagenesis rate enforcing a constant struggle for survival.69 Another mechanism which results in an increased virulence and a switch in species specificity is the recombination of partial genomes from related viral strains, as is common in influenza viruses.70, 71\n",

The high copy number of a limited set of small proteins beneficially decreases the length of nucleic acid needed to encode for them, requiring less space for encapsulation.72 This illustrates some of the brilliant and efficient principles underlying virus structure and function.",

After formation of this nucleus, further building blocks attach to it until the capsid is completed (Figure 3). Under conditions of efficient assembly, the nucleation is generally the rate\u2010limiting step and only a small fraction of the proteins are in this intermediate state. The following elongation steps take place at a much higher rate leading to immediate propagation of the nucleus to a capsid. Therefore, the intermediate oligomeric species forming the assembly nucleus are typically only present in trace amounts under assembly conditions.26, 73, 76, 77 For some viruses, it is possible to change the solution conditions favoring over\u2010nucleation, whereby intermediates become kinetically trapped. Still, even under such conditions, processes such as protein mis\u2010folding and aggregation, can further hamper the detection of these intermediates.67, 78\u201380 A low nucleation rate ensures effective capsid assembly. Nucleation can be triggered by increasing concentration or posttranslational modifications to secure a sufficiently high titer of cp in the cell. Also, interactions with the nucleic acid can facilitate nucleus formation.78, 81, 82\n",

Theoretical and experimental results suggest that the interaction between individual building blocks is rather weak and cannot account for the high apparent stability.73, 88 However, in the capsid the binding energies of the subunits add up, explaining the pseudo\u2010stability of the capsids under conditions where assembly typically does not occur. Nevertheless, theory suggests that in such a pseudo\u2010equilibrium, there are always some free building blocks in solution that could dynamically exchange with proteins in the capsid. This process has been termed \u201ccapsid breathing\u201d and some indirect experimental evidence has been described supporting this model.88\u201392 We like to note that the term \u201cbreathing\u201d has also been used to describe the significant conformational changes that can occur in viral cp proteins, sometimes even resulting in transient externalization of domains that, according to structural models, are on the inside.91, 93\n",

In this virus, cp monomers assemble around the RNA and the length of the genome defines the nucleocapsid size.94, 95 Icosahedral structures allow the complete closure of the shell using just one type of protein.72 Additionally, the almost spherical structure reduces the surface area relative to the enclosed volume. An icosahedron consists of 12 vertices, 20 faces, and 30 edges corresponding to the different symmetry axis (5\u2010, 3\u2010, and 2\u2010fold, respectively). At least 30, generally dimeric, building blocks are required to form the smallest possible icosahedron, where all proteins are located in pentamers. Larger capsids are formed by addition of hexamers. Only certain numbers of hexamers can be inserted to produce a perfect icosahedron reflected by the triangulation number (T): T=h\n2 + h \nk + k\n2 where h and k can be any positive integer and T=2 is therefore not allowed. The number of building blocks corresponds to 30 T. Even though viral capsids can be built up by a single cp, the surrounding contacts between subunits in hexamers and pentamers are different.96, 97 However, the conformational changes to compensate this are often marginal, yielding cp structures that are quasi\u2010equivalent. Additional hexamers may be introduced in a ring\u2010like fashion leading to prolate capsids as in bacteriophage Phi29.98, 99 Complex viruses often deviate from icosahedral symmetry, for example the HIV cp typically forms conical, but also rod\u2010shaped capsids.100\n",

These capsomers then build the spherical, thick\u2010walled prohead I (Figure 5). The N\u2010terminal \u0394\u2010domain functions as a scaffold and is cleaved off during maturation leading to prohead II. Such examples of proteolytic cleavage have been observed in many viruses and the exact location of cleavage can be identified using proteomics based methods (Figure 4).163 A critical step in HK97 maturation is the conformational change leading to a thin\u2010walled icosahedral capsid or phagehead. This expansion is usually accompanied by DNA packaging, but can be triggered in vitro in the absence of DNA and of the packaging machinery. Major structural changes associated with this transition were recognized in EM and crystallography studies. However, the resolution achieved was limited for some intermediate structures. H/D\u2010exchange MS (Box 3) on the different intermediates in the head assembly, from capsomers to the nearly mature head I, could precisely demonstrate which amino acids were involved in the changes accompanying maturation (Figure 5).66, 131, 164 The next step in maturation is the autocatalytic cross\u2010linking of the cp subunits locking the capsid in the expanded conformation.

The successful transfer of the TMV into the gas phase using ESI was demonstrated as early as 1996.83 In these pioneering studies, the exact mass determination was precluded by the limitations of the mass analyzer employed. However, collection of the electrosprayed TMV particles and subsequent EM analysis disclosed that the viral structures had been largely retained. The TMV harvested after MS was even infective. Since then, multiple instrumental setups have been applied to estimate the mass of virus particles. A combination of m/z and charge detection in a ToF analyzer resulted in an estimated mass of 40 MDa for TMV, with a substantial uncertainty of 15 %.170 ESI can thus be readily used to ionize viruses and viral particles, but accurate mass analysis is not straightforward when these particles become too big or heterogeneous. ESI has been combined with gas\u2010phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analyzers (GEMMA).171, 172 The high charge of particles produced by ESI is reduced to obtain singly charged ions, which are subsequently separated and sized by their electrophoretic mobility. GEMMA analysis was successfully applied on the 4.6 MDa cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV). Although the mass resolution of such an instrument is still too low to enable accurate mass measurement, GEMMA does provide in parallel information about the electrophoretic mobility diameter of the analyzed particle. Such analysis indicated that the gas\u2010phase CCMV particle had largely retained its quaternary structure (Figure 4).171, 172\n",

More acidic pH values resulted in chiefly cp dimers. Intriguingly at basic pH values, higher order oligomers were formed preferentially at high ionic strength. Remarkably, the transition between T=3 particles and other oligomers was fully reversible. The larger oligomers most likely arose from initial dissociation of the T=3 capsids into dimers and subsequent reassembly. The main products of this pathway were identified as 60\u2010 and 80\u2010mers, although also smaller oligomers were present under certain conditions (Figure 7). Atomic force microscopy (AFM)177 and earlier EM studies178 confirmed that T=1 norovirus capsids consisting of 60 cp subunits can be formed at basic pH values.

Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature,66 2009. d) In HIV, the immature capsid of the Gag polyprotein encloses the (+)ssRNA and becomes enveloped. After release from the cell, the viral protease cleaves the Gag into three major proteins and some small peptides. The matrix domain stays bound to the lipid envelope through a myristoyl residue and the nucleocapsid domain is associated with the ssRNA. A conformational change in cp leads to a collapse of the spherical towards a conical capsid. At this stage the virus is infective. Other proteins, including the protease and peptide fragments, are omitted for clarity.64\n",
