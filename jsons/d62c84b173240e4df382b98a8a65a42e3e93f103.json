The top position of the filter could potentially help eliminate water vapor more efficiently. An air-filled silicone tube is utilized to create an air-tight silicone cushion seal with the user's face. Figure 4B illustrates a top down view of the design in Figure 4A . Note that the frame creates a separation between the face and the lenses, which is designed to fit over one's prescription glasses. Figure 4C illustrates a front view of a filter cartridge with a frame and filter. The filter cartridge is placed (large arrow) into the cartridge slot on a FEM.",

This hole can be covered with a small replaceable filter with an adhesive portion to secure it to the lens.

In this article, we discussed a novel FEM, which holds promise in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Design considerations for a Filtered Eye Mask (FEM). Finally, the use of proper PPE including eye protection is very important, especially for the health workers who are in close contact with the patients with active COVID-19 infections during a pandemic or even an outbreak. Additionally, such an eye protection would also be quite useful for research personnel around the world who must wear eye protection with a face shield or full head respirators, such as Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs). First, and foremost, heeding the recommendations of the CDC is of paramount importance in mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak. See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html With respect to minimizing transmission through the eyes, the CDC recommends avoid touching your eyes with unwashed hands.",
