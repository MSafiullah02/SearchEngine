Moreover, dental staff may be conflicted about performing their professional roles as health care providers versus their roles as family members (e.g., spouse/parents). According to Maunder et al. [5], the conflict of altruism and professional liability, on the one hand, with fear and blame for potentially endangering their relatives to a highly infectious agent, on the other hand, was a tremendous burden for many medical staff individuals during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

This may be supported by scientific evidence showing that there is an unwillingness on the part of dentists to treat patients with infectious diseases such as HIV [26,27] and tuberculosis [28]. With reference to the psychological factors, high subjective overload and a low score for self-efficacy were found to be associated with elevated psychological distress. The association of subjective overload with psychological distress might be explained through the Karasek\u2019s job demand\u2013control\u2013support model [29] which argues that the experience of stress (stress outcomes) is a consequence of the interaction between the stressor (e.g., job demands), the individual\u2019s perception of their control over the stressor (e.g., job control), and social support. As the on-going management of COVID-19 is full of uncertainty and characterized by the individual having low levels of control (along with social isolation, which prevent teamwork), it might be that dental staff are experiencing a higher than usual subjective overload.",

Indeed, in stressful events, self-efficacy plays a crucial role, as at high levels it can enhance personal performance in different occupational tasks and related behaviors [30]. In accordance with this finding, self-efficacy among rescue workers was found to mediate the association between stress appraisal and compassion satisfaction [31]. Furthermore, general self-efficacy was found as a mediator for the association of daily life stressors with psychopathological symptoms and subjective well-being [32]. One possible explanation may stem from the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory [33,34] which proposes that individuals seek to build up and retain resources as a result of actual or threatened loss thereof, after coping with stressful circumstances. Resource gains can help to offset the impact of resource losses. As such, it might be that those with higher self-efficacy succeed in acquiring more resources to handle such situations and their consequences in the future. ",
