According to the data of China Statistical Yearbook, dozens of hazards occur every year, causing direct economic losses amount to tens of billions Yuan. Cities need not only to establish a defense system against natural disasters, but also to protect the lives and properties of residents from hazards such as economic fluctuations and epidemics (Godschalk 2003). Therefore, cities need an ability to defend, recover and adapt disturbances when facing with them (Fang et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018). Evaluating urban resilience and analyzing the factors that influence city\u2019s response to hazards can find weak points in urban management, so that relevant departments can take targeted improvement measures and build a stronger city.",

The research methods involved mathematical analysis methods and spatial analysis methods (Cimellaro et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2018). Moreover, most scholars focused on the performance of cities in response to a single disaster such as earthquake or flood disasters (Martins et al. 2012; Lyu et al. 2018), while the engagement with the evaluation of comprehensive urban resilience is still limited. Additionally, when evaluating the urban resilience comprehensively, it is necessary to consider the impact of various factors such as social, economic and environmental factors (Wang et al. 2018). The evaluation indicators have characteristics of both accuracy and fuzziness, and some indicators need to be quantified by the subjective opinions of experts. Therefore, the comprehensive urban resilience evaluation is a hybrid multiple attribute group decision-making problem, but the research of scholars on solving this problem is still limited. In order to bridge the gap, the specific objective of this study was to propose a method in solving the hybrid multi-attribute urban resilience evaluation problem and evaluate the comprehensive urban resilience of a certain city, hoping it may help to improve the city resilience.",

In the group decision-making process, different backgrounds, personal habits, the nature of human judgment or vague knowledge about the preference degree of experts will lead to different evaluation results (Liao et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2016). Intuitive trapezoidal fuzzy numbers can not only express decision makers\u2019 uncertainty and hesitation when considering the membership of indicators, but also express decision information in different dimensions (Li and Chen 2014; Wei 2015).

Cities are not only a carrier of production and residents\u2019 life, but also an important protector against hazards (Godschalk 2003; Lhomme et al. 2013). A city can be regarded as an integrated system, consisting of many sub-systems such as building systems, medical systems, transportation systems and government management systems (Javidroozi et al. 2015). The effective operation and cooperative work of these systems ensure the normal function of a city. The term \u201cresilience\u201d originated in ecology, it is considered that the resilience of an ecosystem can maintain normal operation when exposed to external threats, or it can return to equilibrium after being disturbed (Hoiling 1973; Folke 2006). These years, scholars extended the definition of resilience and combined it with urbanism and proposed the concept of \u201curban resilience\u201d (Cavallaro et al. 2014; Meerow et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018).",

With consideration of the three abilities above, many organizations and scholars have proposed frameworks regarding city as a system to evaluate the urban resilience. The United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation has all proposed frameworks to evaluate urban resilience (UNISDR 2005; McAllister 2015). The UK government proposed the Strategic National Framework on Community Resilience in 2011 to develop key resilience factors for community resilience (Cabinet Office of UK 2011). Researchers from Kyoto University and Kitakyushu City Center in Japan have also established a comprehensive evaluation framework of resilient cities system (GFDRR 2016). Usually, the evaluation system of urban resilience involved aspects of social, economic, institutional and physical; some of the researchers divided it more detailed into biodiversity, modularity, tight feedbacks, social capital, acknowledging slow variables and thresholds, and innovation (Walker and Salt 2006; Cutter et al. 2008; Orencio and Fujii 2013; Singh-Peterson et al. 2014; Qasim et al. 2016).",

The decrease in per capita urban road area is related to the urban construction of Dalian municipal government and the annual growth of population. After 2014, the per capita urban road area has increased slightly, and the number of health institutions has also increased.

Based on the results of the above sensitivity analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:Among the 28 indicators for comprehensive evaluation of urban resilience, the most sensitive ones that affect urban resilience involve four (4 out of 20) crisp indicators and two (2 out of 8) fuzzy indicators. It shows that in the comprehensive evaluation of urban resilience, it is impossible to reflect the real situation by relying only on crisp indicators, and it is necessary to consider fuzzy indicators.The urban resilience is closely related to A Class indicators, and the following aspects of the city need to be remediated or constructed to lift urban resilience.Among the fuzzy indicators, the ones with greater influence are A7 climate change risk and C6 price. Therefore, the result may give us an inspiration that climate change needs to be paid more attention on. Moreover, when a city suffers hazards, residents are likely to be pessimistic and less cooperated if prices are not stable. Thus, the government\u2019s ability to control prices is also one of the important factors for a city to get through it.",

For example, coastal cities are prone to natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis, and cities in plate turbulent regions are more likely to suffer from disasters such as earthquakes. Therefore, the aspects of emphasis on prevention and construction vary between cities. Meanwhile, under the context of the world\u2019s great development, hazards such as epidemics and financial crises are also unpredictable. Many hazards occur suddenly and have no obvious omen. A novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Corman et al. 2020). In the event of such hazards, are there enough health facilities to receive patients? Can the government carry out a medical emergency plan rapidly to avoid the disease spreading into a larger scale? These abilities are closely related to the comprehensive resilience of a city, and the improvement in it is a long-term and slow process.
