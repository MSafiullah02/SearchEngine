These stem-loops in the 3\u2032 UTR, including the binding site for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), are involved in the accumulation, minus-strand RNA initiation, polyadenylation, and long-distance movement of viral RNA (Cheng et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2001, Tsai et al., 1999).",

In contrast, poly(A) tails play an important role in mRNA translation and turnover (Proudfoot, 2011, Sachs and Wahle, 1993, Weill et al., 2012) and the movement of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in eukaryotes (Huang and Carmichael, 1996, Millevoi and Vagner, 2010). For positive-sense RNA viruses, poly(A) tails have been implicated in RNA stability, translation (Bergamini et al., 2000), and replication (Guilford et al., 1991, Tsai et al., 1999). A positive correlation between the length of the poly(A)-tail and virus infectivity has been reported for several viruses including BaMV (Tsai et al., 1999), White clover mosaic virus (Guilford et al., 1991), poliovirus (Sarnow, 1989) and Cowpea mosaic virus (Eggen et al., 1989). Furthermore, the 3\u2032 poly(A) sequences of several positive-sense RNA viruses, such as bovine coronavirus (Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000) and BaMV (Lin et al., 2007), interact with the host proteins required for viral RNA replication.",

Although cytoplasmic polyadenylation has been reported previously in eukaryotes, the polyadenylation activities are mainly involved in oogenesis (the early development of many animal species) and regulating the diverse forms of translational activation in the cytoplasm (Radford et al., 2008, Villalba et al., 2011).",

Accordingly, only 7 to 10 adenylates at the 3\u2032 end of the plus-strand RNA are initially synthesized from the minus-strand RNA template during viral replication.

In this study, we test whether the same extract contains the polyadenylation activity. For a polyadenylation activity assay, RNA products synthesized from endogenous RNA were labeled with radioactive [\u03b1-32P] ATP during RNA replication and subsequently analyzed based on digestion with the RNase A/T1 (specific on the unpaired pyrimidines and guanine, respectively) digestion (\nFig. 1A). The poly(A) RNA fragments with a higher radio-labeling intensity were generated by NP40-treated replicase complex rather than by untreated replicase complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). The sizes of the poly(A) fragments ranged from approximately 40 to 200 nts, which is consistent with the reported 3\u2032 poly(A) length of BaMV genomic RNA (Chen et al., 2005). All subsequent polyadenylation activity assays were conducted using NP40 solubilization.",

Furthermore, the radioactive RNA fragments generated by RNase A/T1 digestion were hybridized with oligo-dT39 and subjected to RNase T2 (cleavage at the unpaired nucleotides) digestion (\nFig. 2A). The results indicate that the treatment converted the smeared radioactively labeled RNA fragments (Fig. 2, lane 2) into a 39-base ladder (up to 195 bases) (Fig. 2, lanes 3\u20135). Therefore, the RNA smears detected on the gel were likely polyadenylates generated in vitro by the replicase complex.

The highest endogenous RNA polyadenylation activity was detected in BF3 (\nFig. 3A, top panel, lane 2), whereas the highest RdRp activity was detected in BF3 to 5 (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). In other words, BF4 and 5 appeared to contain components of full RdRp activity but lower polyadenylation activity compared with BF3. Subsequently, BF4 and 5 were pooled together and supplemented with fractions from uninfected plants to test whether host proteins are involved in polyadenylating BaMV RNA. Soluble fraction (HS30) and NP40-solubilized membrane fractions (healthy fraction; HF1 to HF10) of uninfected N. benthamiana plants were added to BF4-5 to test their effects on polyadenylation activity ([\u03b1-32P] ATP labeling; Fig. 3B, top panel) and RdRp activity ([\u03b1-32P] UTP labeling; Fig. 3B, bottom panel) using endogenous RNA templates.

To further demonstrate that the AAUAAA motif in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV RNA is involved in the regulation of polyadenylation, we tested the inhibitory effects of different BaMV 3\u2032 UTR-related RNA molecules on polyadenyaltion. RNA r138/10A contained the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR with 10 adenylates at the 3\u2032 end, whereas r138/10A/\u0394bulge and r138/10A/\u0394IL were r138/10A with a bulge and an internal loop deletion, respectively, (\nFig. 4) (Cheng and Tsai, 1999). The effects of the 3 RNA molecules on polyadenylation activity were evaluated in the in vitro replication assay. The results showed that the signal intensity of polyadenylation was largely unaffected by the addition of RNA in which the conserved AAUAAA sequence was deleted (r138/10A/\u0394IL) (Fig. 4C, lane 2), but reduced and shortened in size by the RNA containing the AAUAAA motif (r138/10A and r138/10A/\u0394bulge) (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4).

However, the polyadenylation enzyme complex could return to the template and copy the G3 sequence during polyadenylation. This could be due to the enzyme copying slippage, although the cloning artifact could not be disregarded. Overall, the results indicate that polyadenylation began before the replication enzyme complex reached the GGG sequence and that BaMV RNA replication was accompanied by an exonuclease activity in which the C3 sequence was removed before the poly(A) tail was added.",

Because BSM13 is a suitable template for minus-strand RNA synthesis, the in vitro reaction could be more efficient in RNA replication than in polyadenylation. To exclude minus-strand RNA synthesis from the reaction, we included only ATP and GTP in the RdRp assay. To test the requirements of the 3\u2032 end structure for polyadenylation, we used the RNA transcripts derived from PCR products to obtain the precise sequence instead of using run-off transcripts, which contain a nonviral sequence (the EcoRI site). BSM13/noA, \u2212/4A, \u2212/7A, and \u2212/13A templates were prepared and incubated with the BaMV replicase complex, and ATP and GTP were included in the reaction. The reaction products were examined using a head-to-tail ligation and RT-PCR analysis (Wu and Brian, 2010) instead of 3\u2032 RACE in which the primer (dT20) might cover the authentic 3\u2032-end sequence. The sequence results indicate that no adenylate can be added to the template without a preexisting adenylate (\nTable 1, BSM13/noA). Long preexisting adenylates at the very 3\u2032 end of the template (with 4, 7, and 13 As) cause efficient for polyadenylation (22%, 46%, and 68%, respectively). The results indicate that the partially purified BaMV replicase complex is capable of polyadenylating the preformed exogenous RNA templates. The RNA template required at least 4 adenylates to obtain a minimum of 22% efficiency for polyadenylation.",

Compared with the untreated BaMV replicase complex preparation, the NP40-treated preparation resulted in enhanced poly(A) signal intensity in the products of the in vitro RNA replication assay (Fig. 1B). This was probably due to particular conformational changes or subunit rearrangements in the enzyme complex induced by the detergent NP40. Numerous studies have not connected the BaMV infection cycle with the nucleus. Therefore, it is unlikely that the addition of the poly(A) tail to the BaMV genome during its replication cycle is processed by the nuclear polyadenylation machinery of the host cell. Plants encode enzymes, such as nucleotidyltransferase and polynucleotide phosphorylase, for the RNA polyadenylation involved in the poly(A)-stimulated RNA degradation pathway in mitochondria and chloroplasts (Lange et al., 2009, Zimmer et al., 2009). Accordingly, the possibility that the polyadenylation of viral RNA occurs through this type of host-encoded cytoplasmic proteins cannot be disregarded.",

Approximately 9 adenylates are added to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA containing a conserved AAUAAA sequence during the first phase. Subsequently, independent of the AAUAAA motif and the associated factors, the polyadenylation complex extends efficiently from the short oligo(A) to generate a full-length poly(A) tail (approximately 200 adenylates) (Sheets and Wickens, 1989). In general, the polyadenylation process of BaMV plus-strand RNA is similar to that of eukaryotic mRNA. These similarities include the requirements of the AAUAAA motif (Chen et al., 2005), the synthesis of a short oligo(A) (derived from the minus-strand template), and the synthesis of a poly(A) tail of a similar length. BaMV minus-strand RNA synthesis was shown to initiate between the seventh to tenth adenylate abutting the 3\u2032 UTR on plus-strand RNA (Cheng et al., 2002), leading to the presence of a few uridylates at the 5\u2032 end of the minus-strand RNA. These uridylates in minus-strand RNA could serve as the template for the first few adenylates of the poly(A) tail on plus-strand RNA. These adenylates could be used as the primer for the synthesis of up to 300 adenylates (Chen et al., 2005). Moreover, mutation of the AAUAAA sequence in the BaMV system led to poly(A) tails of a shorter length (Chen et al., 2005), indicating that the polyadenylation complex of the BaMV replication machinery is associated with the AAUAAA motif during the tailing process.",

In brief, the healthy and BaMV infected leaves were kept in \u221280 \u00b0C. The frozen leaves were homogenized in RdRp complex extraction buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.6, 15 mM MgCl2, 120 mM KCl, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 1 \u03bcM pepstatin A, 0.1 mM phenylmethenylsulphonyl fluoride). The homogenate was filtrated through Miracloth (CalBiochem) and centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. The clarified supernatant was applied to a 30,000\u00d7g ultra-centrifugation for 35 min, and the pellet (P30) was re-suspended in solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 \u03bcM pepstatin A, 1 \u03bcM leupeptin). The 50-\u00b5l BaMV RNA replication assay containing 20 \u00b5l of 1.5% NP40-solubilized replicase fractions (Cheng et al., 2001), 4.8 mg/ml bentonite, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 \u00b5M ATP, 0.066 \u00b5M [\u03b1-32P]-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Dupont-NEN, Boston, MA ), and 2 mM UTP, CTP, and GTP was carried out at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h. For labeling with [\u03b1-32P]-UTP, the concentrations of UTP and ATP were changed to 2 \u00b5M and 2 mM, respectively. The RNA products were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. For assays using exogenous templates, NP40-treated BaMV replicase complex was treated with micrococcal nuclease (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA) and the reaction stopped by adding 30 mM EGTA before the addition of the RNA template (1 \u00b5g).",
