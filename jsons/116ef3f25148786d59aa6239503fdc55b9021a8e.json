While there is a substantial body of literature on burnout in healthcare providers, burnout in pediatric nurses has received less attention. This subpopulation may be unique from adult care nurses because of the specialized nature of providing care to children who are typically seen as a vulnerable population, the high potential for empathetic engagement, and the inherent complexities in the relationships with families. Thus, the aim of this scoping review was to investigate, among pediatric nurses, (i) the prevalence and/or degree of burnout, (ii) the factors related to burnout, (iii) the outcomes of burnout, and (iv) the interventions that have been applied to prevent and/or mitigate burnout. This scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA Guidelines Scoping Review Extension. CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, and The Cochrane Library were searched on 3 November 2018 to identify relevant quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies on pediatric nurse burnout. Our search identified 78 studies for inclusion in the analysis. Across the included studies, burnout was prevalent in pediatric nurses. A number of factors were identified as impacting burnout including nurse demographics, work environment, and work attitudes. Similarly, a number of outcomes of burnout were identified including nurse retention, nurse well-being, patient safety, and patient-family satisfaction. Unfortunately, there was little evidence of effective interventions to address pediatric nurse burnout. Given the prevalence and impact of burnout on a variety of important outcomes, it is imperative that nursing schools, nursing management, healthcare organizations, and nursing professional associations work to develop and test the interventions to address key attitudinal and environmental factors that are most relevant to pediatric nurses.",

As nurses make up the largest group of healthcare professionals, there have been a number of studies that have explored contributing factors [13] and interventions for their burnout [14] . Pediatric nurses are a lesser-studied population, perhaps due to the relatively small number of pediatric nurses compared to general service nurses and the broader population of healthcare professionals. Burnout in pediatric nurses may be unique from adult care nurses because of the specialized nature of providing care to children who are typically seen as a vulnerable population, the high potential for empathetic engagement, and the inherent complexities in the relationships with families [15, 16] . Only one literature review could be located on the topic of pediatric nurse burnout; it mainly focused on burnout prevalence, which was found to be moderate to high [17] . Further synthesis of the literature in other domains of the topic is needed to explore factors associated with pediatric nurse burnout, the associated outcomes, and interventions.",

After deduplication, 8629 titles/ abstracts were screened and 1206 articles were assessed for eligibility at the level of full-text screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 78 studies [16, were deemed relevant and retained for analysis (Fig. 1) . The characteristics of included studies are provided in Table 1 . Publication dates ranged from 1981 to 2018, with the majority published between 2009 and 2017. The number of pediatric nurses who participated as either a primary or sub-sample ranged from five to 3710. The most common study design was cross-sectional (n = 60), with 10 studies using multi-or mixed methods, seven using an interventional design, and one each using case-control, exploratory prospective, and longitudinal designs. Only 45 of the 78 studies reviewed used exclusive samples of pediatric nurses; the remaining studies only included pediatric nurses as a subpopulation of a larger sample. The results in this review are reported for pediatric nurse samples and subsamples only. Almost half (46%) of the included studies were conducted in the USA, followed by Canada (n = 7), China (n = 5), Turkey (n = 3), Brazil (n = 3), Taiwan (n = 2), Australia (n = 2), and Switzerland (n = 2), plus 18 other countries where only a study was conducted. Out of the 78 studies included, 53 (68%) used some form (either complete or abbreviated) of the MBI to measure burnout (see Table 1 ).",

A lack of university-level education or lower self-reported levels of clinical competency were also associated with higher levels of burnout [57, 90] .

Davis et al. [38] found that adult oncology nurses had higher personal accomplishment than pediatric oncology nurses while Neumann et al. [74] found nurses who care for both pediatric and adult patients had lower emotional exhaustion than those who cared for adult patents only. Conversely, Sun et al. [94] found that nurses who worked in adult obstetrics and gynecology units had more burnout than nurses who worked in pediatric units; however, Ohue et al. [78] reported the inverse. Working in hematology/oncology [88] and unit-level factors such as workload [65, 85] , number of assigned patients [26] , increased number of admissions, understaffing, and shifts > 8 h were associated with increased burnout [51, 92, 95, 96] . Aytekin et al. [29] found working longer years in the NICU was associated with lower levels of personal accomplishment. Brusch et al. [36] found that nurses working exclusively day shifts had higher levels of depersonalization than those working night shifts or a mix of days and nights. Favrod et al. [45] found NICU nurses reported more traumatic stressors in their working environment. Pediatric nursing workplaces with a strict structure of rules and regulations [33] or nurse leaders who valued structure over staff considerations [41] were found to have nurses with higher burnout. Nurses who had higher perceived organizational support had lower burnout [39] . Higher burnout was generally associated with systems issues such as unreasonable policies, staffing shortages, insurance frustrations, high volumes of paperwork [65] , lack of nursing supplies [36] , and lack of regular staff meetings [56] . The relationship between resources and facets of burnout was mixed: Rochefort and Clarke [83] found a negative relationship between nurses' emotional exhaustion and their rating of the adequacy of the resources available to them, while Gallagher and Gormley [46] found that even nurses who reported that Higher EE associated with nurses working most frequently in the PICU relative to those working most frequently in the NICU, those who found communication with nurses more stressful, and having a lack of necessary nursing supplies Lower EE associated with being married or in a domestic partnership relative to respondents who were unmarried and not in a domestic partnership, identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander relative to respondents identifying as White",

Nine studies examined work outcomes associated with burnout including nurse retention, nurse well-being, patient safety, and patient-family satisfaction ( Table 4 ). An increase in burnout was associated with nurses considering a career change [37] , decreased quality of life [29] , tiredness [89] , and feeling negatively toward their teammates and the impact of their work [37] . Work-associated compassion fatigue [16, 66] , secondary traumatic stress [48, 58] , and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [37, 60, 70] were all found to be associated with pediatric nurse burnout. However, Li et al. [60] report that high group cohesion may prevent pediatric nurses from developing burnout from PTSD by protecting nurses from the impacts of negative outcomes. Nurse burnout was found to be negatively associated with the safety climate of the hospital in which they work [27, 39] and positively associated with higher infection rates when nurses were feeling overworked [96] . Moussa and Mahmood [71] found that as nurses' personal accomplishment increased, so did patients' mothers' satisfaction with meeting their child's care needs in the hospital.",

Burnout was measured with a variety of instruments and interpretations, thereby making score comparisons a challenge. Even in those studies that used the MBI, the most commonly used burnout measurement [105] , variations of the tool were applied, as were diverse subscale cutoff scores. Similar challenges in synthesizing extremely heterogeneous burnout data were echoed in a 2018 JAMA review of the prevalence of burnout among different types of physicians [106] . Of the MBI Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization subscale results that were synthesized, the results showed moderate scores indicating a significant level of burnout in pediatric nurses. Personal Accomplishment subscale results were high, perhaps indicating a factor of pediatric nursing that increases resilience despite moderate burnout in other domains. In studies that compared nurses who work in pediatric units to other in-patient units, burnout results were mixed [26, 32, 35, 36, 38, 74, 78, 94] . The majority of the included studies identified correlational relationships using cross-sectional study designs, which limited causal inferences. Study designs, such as longitudinal approaches, would allow for causal inference and in-depth analysis of this phenomenon in this unique population.",

Similar burnout associations were found in research studying healthcare providers caring for adults such as younger age (< 31 years) [107, 108] and years of experience (> 7 years) [109] . It is likely that nurses new to the profession are younger, are experiencing the challenges of the nursing profession for the first time, and are less likely to have well-developed skills for resiliency. Given that the start of nurses' careers is a vulnerable stage for burnout, nursing schools and orientation programs may be wellpositioned to highlight burnout prevention and mitigation strategies with students and new hires [107] . Personality traits such as high neuroticism and low agreeableness were found to be associated with pediatric nurse burnout [31] . These results have been supported in other nurse and physician populations, along with conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness contributing to lower levels of burnout [110] [111] [112] [113] . Although personality traits appear to have significant correlations with healthcare provider burnout, targeting modulation of personality traits as a mitigation strategy for burnout may be a high-cost, low-yield strategy.",

Although Bursch et al. [36] found that pediatric nurses who worked straight day shifts had higher depersonalization than those who worked mixed shifts or just night shifts, Poncet et al. [108] found that working more night shifts was associated with higher burnout in adult critical care nurses. Day shift nurses have potentially more strenuous workloads as patients are more wakeful, have diagnostic tests, or consulting services visiting; however, night shifts could be perceived as more strenuous as it requires the provider to work against their natural circadian rhythm and less support staff are available [120] .

In pediatric nurses [39] , increased perception of organizational support is associated with lower burnout; this association is supported in general nursing populations [119, 123] . In all populations, the support a healthcare provider perceives they get from the organization is predictive of their level of organizational commitment. When healthcare providers perceive that they have high organizational support, they will exhibit greater organizational citizenship behavior, which are extra-role tasks that ultimately improve the organization [124] . Burnout itself results in reduced organizational commitment on the part of the healthcare provider [125] . The experience of witnessing patient suffering and death [65, 122] , uncertainty around plan/utility of care [15, 56, 126] , moral distress [15, 85] , and behavioral issues with patient families (e.g., aggressive patients/families) [65, 79, 127] were found to be significant factors that contributed to burnout in both pediatric nurses and general population physicians and nurses.",

            "text": "Although only seven of the studies analyzed in this review included interventions, there is modest evidence on the efficacy of burnout interventions in the broader healthcare provider population. Similar to the results of Hallberg [50] , a study of Swedish district nurses showed no impact of clinical supervision on burnout [143] . While Morrison Wylde et al. [70] found a marginal improvement in pediatric nurse burnout with smartphonebased intervention vs. traditional mindfulness interventions, studies investigating mindfulness interventions in other healthcare populations reported mixed results [144] [145] [146] [147] . Similar to pediatric nurses [84] , social workers showed a significant decrease in burnout after attending skills development courses [148] suggesting that improving clinical knowledge and skills may reduce burnout. This is supported by the finding that pediatric nurses with lower clinical competency and education level have increased burnout [57, 90] . Although Edmonds et al. [42] showed significant decreases in pediatric nurse burnout using in-person trauma, adaptive grief, and coping sessions with follow-up, similar sessions have shown mixed results in other healthcare provider populations [149] [150] [151] . More research is needed to identify reliable interventions for pediatric nurse burnout that can be pre-emptively and routinely implemented by nursing schools and healthcare organizations.",

Factors associated with pediatric nurse burnout were similar to those found in other healthcare professional groups and can be separated into the domains of nurse personal factors, work environment, work attitudes, and work outcomes. Only 45 of the 78 studies reviewed studied exclusive populations of pediatric nurses, and most associations identified were correlational. Few interventions to prevent or mitigate pediatric nurse burnout have been undertaken, and the results were mixed, at best. Further studies using mixed methods are needed to expand on these results and incorporate the direct feedback of the nurses. Additional research is needed to develop and test interventions for pediatric nurse burnout. The improvement of pediatric nurse burnout has the potential to improve nurse well-being and, ultimately, patient care. ",
