Patients with signs of Covid 19 infection (respiratory problem) were told about the increased radiation dose that they would receive from an additional ULDCT test. They volunteered themselves for this test and the ULDCT test was performed only after they signed the consent form. Patients were scanned successively with routine and ULD chest CT protocols, without patient motion between two scan protocols. The 128-MDCT Philips Ingenuity system was used to scan the patients. Routine dose protocol uses 120 kVp along with the tube current modulation to scan the chest of the patients referred to the CT department, being done routinely by default. Two ULD scanning parameters were used to scan the volunteer patient, first group of patients were scanned by 98% dose reduction protocol (compare to routine dose) and the second group was scanned by about 94% dose reduction. In the two ULD chest CT protocols, 80 kVp was selected as the excitation tube voltage, while the tube current time product was fixed at 10 and 25 mAs for the first and second group of patients respectively.",

Thus, in either case, the photoelectric effect contributio n at V=80 kVp is much higher than that at V=120 kVp. This means that at V=80 kVp, any small difference in the effective atomic number Zeff, gets highly magnified owing to the higher value of b(80) than b(120)and significant increase in Zeff x . This is the reason for more sensitive detectability of structures by increasing the photoelectric contribution (increasing contrast). Enhancement of the contribution from the Compton scattering part would be very limited, since a(80)\u2248a(120)~1-0.90, and the lung is made of low density material (Compton scattering is dominant) [10] .",

The photon number for 80 kVp with filter is thus only 7.8% of the corresponding one in the 80kVp case while the SNR in the ULDCT case is thus lower by a factor of \u221a2.56 3.25 \u2044 , i.e. 0.35 than that in the normal case.

The SNR, though reduced by a factor of 0.14, from that of the normal dose, is presumed to be not beyond the power of the Iterative Reconstruction of algorithm to correct for. This is important for the patients' safety as well as for that of the technical staff. This low voltage and mAs, used in ULDCT, would also protect the machines from breakdown, which is another important requirement for dealing with the situation under the threat of Covid 19 epidemic.",

Also, using ULD CT protocols reduces the CT system's work load, therefore increases the stability and lifetime of x-ray tubes. In the background of the new pandemic (Covid 19), there is an increasing demand for chest CT requests in 2020 compared to the same season in the previous years. Its importance is in diagnosis of covid 19 patients is pointed out in the present paper. The authors of this study suggest that ULD chest CT protocol with 94% dose reduction should be used as a new guideline to substitute routine dose chest CT.",

Both of them independently reported the existence of the same features in both routine dose and ULD chest CT protocols. Some of the typical findings, as presented in the result section are; Ground glass opacity, consolidation, reticular lines, atoll or reverse halo sign and air bronchogram.The authors of this study decided to use the 94% dose reduction protocol as a ULD CT protocol in patients suspected of Covid 19. Since chest CT images are used as a very important and valuable means to detect lung lesions related to new coronavirus (Covid 19) in early stage, ULD chest CT with 98% dose reduction can be used as a substitute to plain radiograph in non-pandemic situatio n.This preliminary study shows the importance of ULDCT for early detection of lung infection inCovid 19 patients by identifying the abnormal structures in the lung such as ground glass opacities and consolidations. Two questions need to be addressed here, to be explained on the basis of CT's operational principles and thus justify the power of the method used. The CT machine works on the principle of x-ray attenuation coefficient of matter in the part of the radiation. The mean attenuation coefficient () is given by \u0302 = [a(V)\u03c1e + b(V) (\u03c1e Zeff x )], where \u03c1e is the electron density and Zeff is the effective atomic number of the material with x=3-4 being the exponent of the photoelectric absorption while a(V) and b(V) are the coefficients of the Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption. These quantities, a(V) and b(V) are averaged over the source spectrum of the CT, with V in kVp, is the operational voltage of the CT machine. While the Compton scattering part has a weak dependence on the photon energy(E), the photoelectric absorption has a strong increase (~1/E 3 ) with decreasing E. Our computations with the well-known Boone-Seibert source spectrum [9] show that without filter, a(80)=5.76\u00d710 -25 , b(80)=3.34\u00d710 -27 ; a(120)=5.05\u00d710 -25 , b(120)=2.2\u00d710 -27 ; while on using a standard aluminum filter of 7 mm thickness, we have: a(80)=5.4\u00d710 -25 , b(80)=5.43\u00d710 -28 , a(120)=5.35\u00d710 -25 ,b(120)= 4.75\u00d710 -28 ,",
