From reviewing the organization of infection control in other countries and from descriptions of outbreaks in the literature, the extent of the resources available in many European hospitals in not clear. In particular, there is a need to define the minimum number of infection control nurses per acute hospital beds, in general and in tertiary referral centres, and whether or not the infection control doctor/microbiologist should always be based on site. In tandem with this, there is a need to agree a minimum number of isolation beds for an acute hospital and the minimum space between beds, as both factors are important components in preventing infection.",

Nonetheless, the absence of a European or global consensus on the minimum resources for nosocomial infection prevention is a handicap as there is no agreed standard to bring to national agencies. Agreement on the definitions and priorities for the surveillance of nosocomial infection are welcome, but this needs to be linked to the minimum resources required to achieve this. The Irish Health Services Executive is currently developing a set of national standards for infection control in Ireland. These standards, when finalised, will hopefully inform the provision of appropriate resources while also establishing corporate responsibility for infection control within the Irish health service.",
