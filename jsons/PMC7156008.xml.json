Both health insurance and healthcare delivery systems were under direct control of the government. Health insurance was determined based on people\u2019s working status and residence. In urban areas, the Government Insurance Scheme (GIS) covered government officials and staff, and the Labor Insurance Scheme (LIS) covered employees at state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In rural areas, the Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS) covered much of the population. All programs were government-based. No private insurance was available in that period. As for the delivery system, all healthcare facilities, including village clinics, township health centers, and county and city hospitals, were owned and operated by the government, at different levels. Providers were subsidized by the government. Prices of healthcare services were kept low by regulation, with the aim\u2014\u201cequal access to the healthcare system for all.\u201d",

Due to the breakup of communes there has been a lack of funding, which resulted in an almost total collapse of CMS in rural areas. As many SOEs faced financial difficulties, a large number of SOE employees in urban areas lost insurance coverage. In 2003, 78% of the population was uninsured (Ministry of Health, 2008). Private health insurance was introduced in the early 1980s, but its development was limited. As for the delivery system, subsidies received by healthcare institutions decreased dramatically. Since hospitals had become financially autonomous, they had incentives to oversupply healthcare services in order to increase revenues. Although private hospitals and clinics were permitted to enter markets, the percentage of private providers was relatively low. In 2003, there were only 2037 private hospitals, compared to 15,727 public hospitals (National Health and Family Planning Commission, 2015). The percentage of number of visits in private institutions was even smaller.",

In 2009, Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) was formally introduced nationwide to cover urban residents who were not eligible for UEBMI. The above programs, which covered over 95% of the population, remained the three basic insurance programs in China. In 2012, Catastrophic Health Insurance (CHI) was also introduced to provide coverage for enrollees in URBMI and NRCMS who had catastrophic medical spending. In recent years, private insurance was also allowed and encouraged to act as a supplement to public insurance. Fig. 9.1\nillustrates the structures of the five types of insurance programs.",

The government had gathered much experience by implementing previous programs, but faced problems in the process. It was risky and expensive to reform the existing system. CHI is the latest program, and has provided the government with an opportunity to design alternative policies. The scheme has a smaller budget than the other programs. As the financial risk is smaller, the government has been willing to pilot new policies. A significant difference between CHI and other programs is that the private insurance firms involved participated more actively in the system. This was due to the fact that there were mechanisms designed to incentivize private firms. We also briefly discuss the other four types of insurances.",

The program was initially piloted in some regions, and was then rapidly extended to the entire nation.

However, it is difficult for the government to predict the magnitudes of the enrollees\u2019 responses to changes in reimbursement policies. The government is concerned that the program funding could become insufficient for compensation, if the coverage becomes too generous. This was the reason for initiating a separate program, CHI, with a limited budget. Even if the reimbursement rate was inappropriately designed, the program would have only borne limited financial risk. In addition, the government has been encouraging private firms to manage CHI and to share in the risks associated. This is another benefit of the separate implementation of the CHI.",

Most of the basic programs are directly undertaken by the government, which collects premiums and makes payments to hospitals. There are only a few exceptions where private insurance firms participate in managing the public programs. However, experience has indicated that the government is inefficient in managing the insurance in terms of controlling medical cost and improving quality of care. In many places the objective of the local governments seems to be balancing the budget and to achieve a small surplus. The authorities have little incentive to spend funds efficiently. Many government employees in charge of the programs have lacked the professional skills needed to engage in insurance administration. Hence, in CHI, instead of direct management, a large portion of local governments have been choosing to contract out their reimbursement processes to private insurance firms, or they have been purchasing catastrophic insurance from private firms and providing it to the population.",

First, it provides consulting services for enrollees and explains the insurance policy to them. Second, it constructs an electronic system to collect and manage the medical claims information of the enrollees. Third, it reviews medical bills, controls unnecessary care, and tries to detect fraudulent behaviors on the parts of the enrollees or providers. Fourth, it implements the reimbursement procedures and makes payments to providers. In some areas, the insurance firms in question do not take the risk of loss from excess payment. In some regions, the private firms share financial risk with the government. The model depends on communication and negotiation between the government and insurance firms in local areas.",

In the course of administering the insurance, firms could collect abundant medical information concerning the enrollees. This information could be used to support the design and management of supplemental private insurance. Furthermore, recognition by the enrollees and the government is important for the reputation of private insurers. Enrollees are more likely to purchase private insurance plans provided by the same insurer, if they are satisfied with their CHI services. The same insurer is more likely to be selected to undertake the three basic medical insurance programs, in the case that the service-purchase model continues to be applied by the government in the future.

In 2009, the government made a contract with a private insurance firm to manage URRBMI, including making payments, reviewing medical bills, and managing financial risk. The firm\u2014the PICC Health Insurance Company\u2014was the first health insurance company in China. It was founded jointly by the People\u2019s Insurance Company of China (PICC) and the DKV in 2005. The former has continued to be one of the top comprehensive insurance companies in China, and the latter is the largest commercial insurance company in Europe. The firm was given permission to sell supplemental private insurance plans in the market. In 2012, the city implemented the CHI, and the firm continued to manage the associated CHI services.

The range of profit/loss rate was 3%. Within this range, the insurer took full responsibility for the profit or the loss. In the case that the profit or loss exceeded 3%, the insurer only took half of the profit/loss, and the other half was shared by the government. At the same time, CHI had a ceiling on coverage.

Insurers have comparative advantages while providing professional services. For example, in Zhanjiang, about 700 employees would be hired to implement the CHI if the program was directly provided by the government. Instead, by purchasing services from private firms, no additional positions were added to the government.1 In addition, the electronic system and office equipment are provided by the private firms, which has also saved the government from providing funding.2 For instance, in Zhanjiang, this privatization was estimated to have saved the government about 8 million RMB in relevant investment. While collaborating with the government, the insurer has to make an effort to provide high-quality services while controlling the medical costs, such as helping the enrollees to understand the insurance policy, reviewing the medical bills to reduce fraud, and improving the information system to speed up the reimbursement process. Per capita inpatient medical spending decreased from 8851 RMB in 2007 to 3869 RMB in 2011 in Zhangjiang (Chen, 2013).

In 2011, only 0.3% of the population, or about 4.0 million people, were covered by private insurance (Ministry of Health, 2013). The majority were urban residents with relatively higher incomes. In 2013, the total claims of private insurance only accounted for 1.3% of total healthcare expenditure (Yan, 2015). In general, private insurance is much more expensive than public insurance and the coverage is usually more generous. Both adverse selection and moral hazard appear to be at work in the market for private insurances. The average medical spending for the population with private insurance is therefore much higher than that for the population without it.",

The second model is capitated global budget (CGB) combined with the notion of a risk corridor. The global budget is determined by a simple capitation rate. At the end of the compensation period, government and providers share the surplus or the loss of the fund. This method reduces the financial risk borne by providers. The third model is similar, but determines the capitation rate with a more sophisticated method. Similar to risk adjustment models in other countries using regulated competition in the health insurance sector, age and diagnoses are considered while determining the capitation rate for each enrollee.5 Different models are applied in different regions to suit the skills and policy choices of the local government.

The first was an equalization fund, which constituted an additional fund used to compensate for the loss of small hospitals ex post. The second was open enrollment. Enrollees could freely choose any in-network provider as a gatekeeper when seeking care and were allowed to change the gatekeeper each year. Thus hospitals were incentivized to compete with each other to attract patients. Enrollees were able to get reimbursed only when they received services from or were referred by the gatekeepers. The gatekeeper was responsible for all costs related to the enrollees, including the referrals. Gao et al.

There are several possible reasons to explain why no significant impacts are found. First, providers may not change their behavior immediately. As stated in Yip et al. (2014), it takes almost a year for providers to understand the incentives embedded in the reform. It is possible that impacts might appear if studied over a longer time period, though current studies contain no evidence about this. Second, the reforms were implemented for some but not all insurance programs that made payments to providers, thus potentially diluting their effects. For example, the Ningxia reform only implemented NRCMS, and the Changde reform only implemented URBMI. It is possible that the share of revenue from the reformed programs, or the reformed services, was insufficient to change the behavior of providers. Third, some reforms imposed limits on policy designs. For example, in the Shandong reform, the comparison is between CGB and CGB combined with pay-for-performance, so the conclusion is that pay-for-performance had not significantly affected medical spending under the capitation payment system. The reason could be that the performance measures were not appropriately selected, at least, measures on total spending, or the incentives were not strong enough to influence physician behaviors.",

            "text": "Two lessons can be learnt from the reform experiences narrated above. First, reform can be successfully implemented only when the government, as the major payer, has an incentive to do so. In the sample described above, the reforms were either initiated by the government or were using policies designed by researchers, but with strong government support. Payment system reform was first recognized as a direction for reform by the government in 2009, and its importance kept increasing since then (State Council, 2009). In 2011, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued a special document promoting payment system reform, stating that local governments were to be encouraged to explore alternative payment methods, including global budget, capitation on outpatient care, and bundled payment on inpatient care (Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, 2011). In the government document issued in November 2016, payment system reform was one of the major tasks listed by the government, along with public hospital reform and referral system implementation. It is expected that there will be more reforms in the future, and the implementation would progressively become easier. Second, pay-for-performance works well, at least with respect to the designated performance measures. In most reforms where pay-for-performance was introduced, inappropriate prescribing was reduced. The change of incentives in this realm indeed changed the behaviors of providers. However, combined with the observation that total spending had not changed, it is difficult to draw a general conclusion that the quality of care had been improved or costs reduced. It is possible that the unnecessary prescribing had been replaced by unnecessary examinations and tests. Changes of provider behavior need to be assessed more comprehensively in future research.",

The debate has concentrated not only on promotion of private investment in hospitals, but it has also influenced the insurance sector. On the one hand, compared to government bureaucracies, insurance firms are professional institutions with more up-to-date methods and skilled personnel. They have come up with incentives to perform well and reduce unnecessary care. On the other hand, as the goal of a firm is to earn profits, the quality of services may be affected if public supervision is insufficient. How the private insurance firms are managed and supervised remains an empirical question. Though many CHI programs are being operated by private insurers, there has been sparse analysis comparing privately operated and publicly operated models.",

At present, each region has chosen a single insurer to manage the insurance. The model is simple, and payment can be easily transferred. However, the disadvantage is that the government may have less negotiation power while purchasing services from a single firm. It may also be hard to switch to another insurer, as those compensating services require a large amount of investment on fixed cost in early stages, such as equipment and staff training. If competition were introduced, perhaps in a way similar to the Medicare Advantage system of the United States, insurers would face competitive pressure and may have greater incentives in controlling costs.",

            "text": "When capitation is implemented in China, it would raise concerns about narrow provider selection. In the capitation model, patients are usually restricted to seeking medical care in contracted hospitals. In some models, referrals are allowed, but primary facilities have little incentive to do so as they have to bear the cost of transferred patients. This is the reason why a lot of capitation reforms were firstly piloted on outpatient services. Inpatient services involve more serious illnesses, and it may be inefficient to restrict patients to specific hospitals that may be able to treat them. However, even with regard to outpatient care, it remains a question whether it is appropriate to keep all or the majority of the care in one facility. Medical resources are unequally distributed, and there is a large portion of the population living away from their place of registration. An example is rural-to-urban migrants, usually registered in rural towns but working in cities. As they enroll in NRCMS, the capitation payments are more likely to be paid to the township hospitals. In such a scheme, they may have no access to hospitals where they live and work. Therefore, accessibility and quality of care are likely to be affected. Unfortunately, largely because of lack of data, little evidence is available on this issue.",
