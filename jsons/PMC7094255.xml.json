Silver (Ag) nanoparticles boast a broad antimicrobial spectrum (Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al., 2009, Shrivastava et al., 2007) and have shown greater antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi than copper (Cu) (Ruparelia, Chatterjee, Duttagupta, & Mukherji, 2008) or titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (Yun, Bae, Lee, Ji, & Kim, 2009). The antimicrobial efficacy of Ag nanoparticles depends on the size, shape, and concentration of particles and exposure time (Ji et al., 2007, Jung et al., 2011a, Lee and Lee, 2006, Lee et al., 2010). As a result, Ag nanoparticles have been extensively studied with regard to indoor air quality and public human health. The airborne dispersion of Ag nanoparticles is an effective means of air purification (Ji et al., 2007, Jung et al., 2011a), and coating surgical masks with nanoparticles improves the bactericidal performance of the masks (Li, Leung, Yao, Song, & Newton, 2006). Ag nanoparticle-coated activated carbon filters exhibit both effective gas adsorption and antimicrobial activity (Yoon et al., 2008).",

They are typically less toxic, inexpensive, and relatively environmentally friendly compared to inorganic materials such as Ag, Cu, and TiO2 (Carson, Hammer, & Riley, 2006). As such, NPs may be more appropriate for indoor environments. Jung et al.

Another study found that essential oil vapors of savory had a lethal effect on bacteria in ventilation systems and reported a bacterial reduction rate close to total disinfection (Pibiri, Goel, Vahekeni, & Roulet, 2006).",

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are known to be toxic to bacteria (Kang, Herzberg, Rodrigues, & Elimelech, 2008) and they have been used as a substrate to prepare antimicrobial Ag nanoparticle composites due to their excellent chemical and mechanical stability. Using a supercritical fluid technique, Niu, Han, Wu, Yu, and Xu (2010) synthesized one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanomaterials wrapped with Ag nanoparticles, which exhibited a high degree of antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. Rangari et al. (2010) showed that Ag/CNTs and Nylon-6/Ag/CNT hybrid particles were more toxic to microbes than pure Ag particles or CNTs alone. Jung et al. (2011a) demonstrated a simple aerosol technique for fabricating Ag/CNTs hybrids and antimicrobial filters. In addition, Aymonier et al.

Furthermore, co-electrospraying, which entails the use of two parallel nozzles, is capable of producing various hybrid nanoparticles, including coated, nano-laden, and nano-coated particles (Camelot, Marijnissen, & Scarlett, 1999). Using an oppositely charged, twin-head electrospray system (THES), Mou, Chen, Guan, Chen, and Jing (2013) built so-called Janus nanoparticles (those with two or more distinct properties) with controlled nanostructures. Langer and Yamate (1969) synthesized encapsulated (coated) aerosol particles.

The powder was dissolved in pure ethanol and sonicated for 10 min. The liquid was then filtered through a cellulose\u2013acetate membrane filter (0.45-\u00b5m pore size; National Scientific Co., Rockwood, TN, USA) to eliminate insoluble residues, resulting in a 0.625% (w/v) solution of NP. A commercial MWCNT solution (1.0 wt% hollow CNT 50, in sterilized deionized water as the base solution, purity >95%) was purchased from Nano Karbon Co. Ltd., Korea, and used to create MWCNT aerosols.

The system consisted of two separate spray chambers with separate capillaries, a particle hybrid chamber, positive and negative power supplies, and two syringe pumps. The NP and MWCNT suspensions were transferred using metal taper tips (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) and stainless steel tubing (IDEX Health & Science, Oak Harbor, WA, USA), respectively. The tip with an inner diameter of 100 \u00b5m was used for the NP suspension. For the MWCNT suspension, tubing with an inner diameter of 150 \u00b5m was used to increase the number of MWCNTs transferred and to reduce the likelihood of nozzle blockage by nanotubes of the undesired size. Two separate syringes (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) on two individual syringe pumps (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) were used to drive the two solutions. The pump flow rates were 0.08 mL/h (for the NP solution) and 0.8 mL/h (for the MWCNT suspension). Carrier air was filtered through a HEPA filter and a diffusion dryer at a flow rate of 10 L/min prior to its introduction into the separate spray chambers of the THES. Upon application of positive and negative voltages to the separate capillaries via a DC high-power supply (Korea Switching, Seoul, Republic of Korea), the two suspensions were electrosprayed, and the generated droplets were transported immediately into the hybrid chamber (volume: 892.21 cm3) located directly below the orifice plate. The size of the liquid droplets was further reduced by solvent evaporation. Oppositely charged NPs (positive) and MWCNTs (negative) collided with each other via electric Coulombic attraction, coagulating into single NP/MWCNT nanostructures. The electrospray process was monitored using a light source (MLC-150; Motic Instruments, Richmond, BC, Canada), a microscopic charge-coupled device (CCD) digital camera (MARIN F-145C2; Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany), and a computer.",

When the bacterial suspension reached an optical density of 0.7\u20130.8 at 600 nm, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (10,000\u00d7g, 10 min) and washed three times with sterile water. To aerosolize the bacteria, a 30-mL aliquot was placed into a six-jet Collison nebulizer (BGI, Waltham, MA, USA). The bacterial density in the suspension was measured as ~107\n colony forming units (CFU)/mL using a traditional plate count method. As shown in\nFig. 2a, the bacteria were nebulized at an airflow rate of 5 L/min. Dispersed bacterial aerosols were passed through a diffusion dryer to remove moisture and then introduced to a filter holder in which the fabricated antimicrobial filter was installed. The size distribution and concentration of the bacterial aerosol were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS 3321; TSI, Shoreview, MN, USA). The bacteria were allowed to reside on each filter for 5 min. The filter was then removed from the holder and soaked in a 50-mL conical tube containing 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) with 0.01% Tween 80. Samples in the fluid were vortexed for 2 min and then sonicated in an ice bath for 10 min to ensure bacterial transmission from the filter to the PBS buffer. Finally, the suspension was serially diluted, and 100 \u00b5L of each resulting suspension were respectively plated onto nutrient agar (Becton Dickinson) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h.

            "text": "THES was used to prepare NP/MWCNT hybrid nanoparticles. The procedure consisted of two steps: electrospraying two kinds of droplets followed by controlled ethanol evaporation and coagulation of particles resulting from Coulombic collisions between oppositely charged NPs and MWCNTs. In the first step, the droplets containing dissolved NPs experienced a transient phase change from a liquid to a solid (Camelot et al., 1999, Morozov, 2011, Tan et al., 2007).\nFig. 3 shows the WPS size distributions and TEM images of the NPs, MWCNTs, and NP/MWCNTs. A significant transport loss of particles (>90%) was observed when generating pure NP nanoparticles or pure MWCNTs via single-nozzle electrospraying without charge neutralization. These losses were due to the high electrical charge per particle. This phenomenon was similar to that shown in the experimental results of Fu et al. (2012). To mitigate this effect, as shown in Fig. 3a and b, NP nanoparticles or pure MWCNTs were generated using simultaneous electrospray of pure ethanol, the opposite charge polarity of which served to neutralize unipolarly charged NP nanoparticles or MWCNTs. The neutralized NP nanoparticles had a positively skewed size distribution of 10\u2013100 nm with a peak diameter of 11.5 nm, a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.63, and a geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 18.5 nm (Fig. 3a,\nTable 1) (Chen et al., 1995, Feng et al., 2001, Gomez and Tang, 1994, Hogan et al., 2006, Ku and Kim, 2002, Rosell-Llompart and Fernandez de La Mora, 1994, Tang and Smith, 2001). The MWCNTs had a normal distribution of 10\u2013700 nm with a peak diameter of 39.2 nm, GSD of 1.99, and GMD of 44.6 nm (Fig. 3b, Table 1). Hence, the concentration of <40 nm particles observed by the particle sizer in response to the MWCNT solution was not caused by MWCNTs but rather by small debris and impurities such as catalyst particles. The concentration of NP/MWCNT nanoparticles was lower than that of NP nanoparticles but higher than that of MWCNTs (Table 1). The NP/MWCNT particles had a bimodal size distribution with peak diameters of 21.1 and 49 nm, GSD of 1.96, and GMD of 40.7 nm (Fig. 3c, Table 1). We hypothesize that most of NP/MWCNT particles at sizes <30 nm were actually NP particles that did not attach to MWCNTs. Thus, the observed shift in peak size from 39.2 nm (MWCNTs) to 49 nm (NP/MWCNTs) resulted from the combination of NP and MWCNT nanoparticles. TEM was used to confirm the morphology of the nanoparticles. The NP particles were mostly spherical and non-agglomerated due to repulsion forces produced by their unipolar charge, with sizes from ~83 to 183 nm in diameter (Fig. 3a). The MWCNTs were ~0.4\u201320 \u00b5m in length and ~66\u201373 nm in diameter (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c shows NP particles attached to the surface of MWCNTs. Successful combination of MWCNTs and NPs was confirmed by TEM. An analysis of 18 images containing NP/MWCNT nanoparticles showed ~4\u20139 NPs attached to each CNT. Fig. 3c suggests that a small portion of NP nanoparticles was attached to the MWCNTs and that significant transport losses reduced the number of NP nanoparticles in the mixing chamber. As described above, these losses were due to a high electrical charge on NP nanoparticles formed without neutralization, i.e., solely generated NP nanoparticles or MWCNTs in Fig. 3a and b.",

For each filter to have an identical volume of nanoparticles, the deposition time was adjusted depending on the number and volume of particles and their filtration efficiency. Since the NP, MWCNT, and NP/MWCNT nanoparticles had different sizes and densities, determining the amount of particles deposited by volume rather than by number or mass concentration was deemed more appropriate. The particle deposition efficiencies of the control filter against NP, MWCNT, and NP/MWCNT nanoparticles were ~92, 95, and 94%, respectively. Thus, the total particle volume per cross-sectional filter area was ~1.1\u00d710\u20132\n cm3/cm2\nfilter.\nFig. 4 shows the surfaces of pristine filters and antimicrobial filters onto which NP, MWCNT, and NP/MWCNT nanoparticles were deposited. The surface of the pristine filter (Fig. 4a, b) was smooth and clear, while the surfaces coated with NP (Fig. 4c, d) and MWCNT (Fig. 4e, f) nanoparticles were relatively uneven. Compared to the MWCNT coatings, the NP coatings were uniformly deposited onto the filter surface. In contrast, the NP/MWCNT-coated filters (Fig. 4g, h) formed dendrites on the filter surface, which suggests that the unique shape of the NP/MWCNT particles contributes to the formation of dendrites on the filter surface and that the deposition structure increased the contact surface area between the antimicrobial substance and bacteria. There was no additional separation unit for NP and NP/MWCNT nanoparticles. Therefore, the coating on NP/MWCNT-coated filters also contained NP nanoparticles. However, the NP/NWCNT nanoparticles were expected to show a greater antimicrobial activity than that of either the pure NP nanoparticles or pure MWCNTs.",

The total density of bacteria deposited on each filter was ~2.35\u00d7107\n particles/cm2\nfilter.\nFig. 7 shows that the NP/MWCNT filters had a higher antimicrobial activity than the NP and MWCNT filters. Under identical experimental conditions, the NP/MWCNT filters inactivated 95% of the test bacteria while the other filters inactivated <70% of the bacteria (SPSS t-test: p<0.05). These results are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that Ag/CNT nanoparticles or NYLON-6/Ag/CNT hybrid polymer nanocomposite fibers had significant antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species including E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis (Jung et al., 2011a, Rangari et al., 2010). Such inhibition appears to be due to the high contact surface area between bacteria and antimicrobial substances. Factors that have been shown to influence the antimicrobial efficacy of such coated filters include the size, concentration, and shape of the coating materials (Ji et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2007, Pal et al., 2007). The NP nanoparticles used in this study were composed primarily of flavonoids. Flavonoids exhibit an antibacterial activity by reducing the fluidity of the inner and outer layers of bacterial membranes, thereby inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis and deterring energy metabolism (Cushnie & Lamb, 2005). In addition, direct contact between CNTs and bacteria cells causes damage to the outer bacterial membrane and subsequent cell death. Short CNTs are more effective in damaging bacterial cells due to increased interactions with the cell membrane. The open ends of nanotubes can induce further bacterial cell damage (Kang et al., 2008). The primary reason for the enhanced antimicrobial activity of the NP/MWCNT filters was the increased contact surface area resulting from the high surface area of the NP particles and the presence of the MWCNTs. The net effect was the high antimicrobial efficacy of filters coated with hybrid NP/MWCNT nanoparticles.",

The particle size distribution and TEM and SEM analyses showed that NP particles were successfully combined with MWCNTs. The hybrid nanoparticles were continuously deposited onto filter surfaces using an aerosol process. The NP/MWCNT-coated filters exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than those coated only with NP particles or MWCNTs. The fabrication technique described is simple and the resulting hybrid particles have demonstrated a potential for applications in indoor air and/or water purification systems. However, the experimental results also showed that electrical charge optimization on the particles was necessary to increase the synthesis rate of the hybrid nanoparticles. Thus, future studies will include electrical charge optimizations for efficient hybrid nanoparticle synthesis.",
