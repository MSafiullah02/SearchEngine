Although infections we now know as, e.g., rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, etc. were clinically evident in early human history, the initial isolation of individual viruses and their assignment to specific diseases did not occur until about 1898, 120 years ago, a proverbial drop in the bucket of time. Just one lifetime ago, Peter Medawar, awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1960, defined viruses as a piece of nucleic acid surrounded by bad news.",

            "text": "The early pioneers in virology had a very limited armamentarium on hand to classify or identify viruses as microbial agents. At the time of their initial discoveries, microscopes of sufficient power to see viral agents were not yet invented; cell cultures to grow viruses were unknown, and probes like antibodies or nucleic acids to mark an infectious agent were not available. Further, biophysical apparatuses like centrifuges or acrylamide gels to concentrate or separate viral proteins or nucleic acids did not exist. Eventually, the will for discovery caused such techniques to emerge. Their use not only defined modern virology and its classifications, but as virology developed it also provided insights that created contemporary cell and molecular biology, protein and structure/function study, immunology, epidemiology for infectious disease analysis, and emergence of treatment. A triumph of modern pharmacology is the formulation of vaccines and, recently, antiviral drugs. Vaccines changed the landscape of virology. Devastating infectious diseases like smallpox, which once killed or maimed millions of humans, have been eliminated, whereas others like poliomyelitis, measles, rubella (German measles), yellow fever, mumps, etc. can be well controlled and others, like influenza, managed. Antiviral therapeutics against HIV now markedly lessen the almost universal mortality rate formerly associated with AIDS. Further, viruses cause at least 20% of all cancers, and vaccines now routinely control liver cancers caused by hepatitis B virus as well as uterine, cervical, and penile cancers caused by several papilloma virus strains. Vaccines have provided the greatest punch-per-buck of any therapeutic regimen in medicine.",

            "text": "The identification of viruses as infectious agents followed on the heels of pioneer work in the mid-1800s by Louis Pasteur and associates. During that period, the laboratory culturing process was developed for bacteria, which could be grown on enriched agar preparations or broths and were identifiable when the bacteria were fixed on glass slides, stained, and examined under the microscope. Bacteria were isolated by their retention on filters with specific pore sizes (Figure 1(a)). After their collection on filters, growth on agar and identification, specific bacteria could be linked with individual diseases by using Koch's (Henle\u2013Koch) postulates (Figure 1\n(a)). It was with this framework that the first viruses were uncovered (Figure 1(b)). In 1898, Dmitri Losifovich Ivanovski (Ivanovski, 1899), in Russia, and Martinus Beijerinck (Beijerinck, 1899), in the Netherlands, demonstrated that the material responsible for a disease of tobacco plants, instead of being retained, passed through the then smallest pore-sized filter used in the Pasteur\u2013Chamberland apparatus without losing infectivity. Thus, the material at the bottom of the filter-containing flask was smaller than bacteria and proved to remain infective when transferred to an uninfected recipient (plant) of the type from which it was first retrieved (Figure 1(b)). Ivanovsky and Beijerinck identified the first virus, a plant virus they named the tobacco mosaic virus. Almost concurrently, Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch (Loeffler and Frosch, 1898), in Germany, utilizing a similar approach, concluded that the agent causing foot-and-mouth disease of cattle also passed through porcelain filters and induced symptoms of disease when inoculated back into healthy cattle (Figure 1(b)). These observations, highly controversial at the time, provided the basis for defining viruses as subcellular entities that caused distinct forms of tissue destruction, which became hallmarks of specific diseases. The uniqueness of this detective work is even more dramatic when one considers that the infectious virus particles were too small to see and could not grow on the culture media available (Table 1\n). Visualization of viruses awaited the use of electron microscopy in the mid-1930s, and the culturing of living cells necessary for viral replication was not possible until the late 1940s to early 1950s. Figure 1(a) illustrates the beginning of microbiology, and Figure 1(b) illustrates the first viral isolations and lists the conceptual problems such virologists had while proving Koch's postulates. Conceptually, a viral replicating agent was distinguishable from a toxin when dilution of the supernatant material that passed through the Pasteur\u2013 Chamberland filter lost potency on injection into the appropriate host (then it was a toxin). In contrast, if the diluted material retained potency after injection, it was a replicating agent. Yet, not all material obtained from an infected source and passed through a Pasteur\u2013Chamberland-like filter followed by transmission of infectious supernatant material proved to be a virus (Figure 1(c)). In this illustration, filter passage-infected material from scrapie-infected sheep caused a similar disease when inoculated back into healthy sheep, the natural host. However, not until the 1980\u20131990 did research show that this infectious material did not contain nucleic acids but rather that disease was transmitted by the misfolded abnormal prion protein (termed PrPres or PrPsc) from infected sheep (Table 1).",

            "text": "Many viral infections cause acute illnesses. That is, the causative virus enters the body, multiplies in one or more tissues, and spreads locally through the blood, along nerves, or along the respiratory or gut tracts. The incubation period of 2 days to 2 or 3 weeks is followed by signs and symptoms of disease and local or widespread tissue damage. Viruses can be isolated from the patient's blood (serum or blood cells), secretions or washes for a short time just before and after the appearance of symptoms or from their infected tissues. Afterward, the infected host either recovers from the infection, and is often blessed with lifelong immunity to that virus, or dies during the acute phase of illness. Although the majority of life-threatening and debilitating acute virus infections are now controlled through vaccination, it is worthwhile considering the consequences of acute infections like smallpox, measles, and yellow fever in the prevaccine era. Smallpox, before its eradication in 1980, killed over 300 000 000 persons just in the twentieth century and caused a mortality rate of approximately 33% (reviewed in McNeill, 1976, and Oldstone, 2010). In the sixteenth century, when Native Americans were inadvertently exposed to infectious viruses, often carried by Europeans colonizing the New World, the result was a reduction of the native population in Mexico and Latin America from an estimated 20 million to 2 million. This devastating depopulation came primarily from smallpox and measles infections, since these viruses had never before existed in the New World (Oldstone, 2010). Smallpox has now been eliminated from our planet and measles virus controlled, at least in most developed countries. However, measles virus infection was and remains a serious disease today with approximately one per thousand infected persons developing severe destruction of the central nervous system requiring institutionalization. Yellow fever spread up the Mississippi River, carried by infected passengers incubating the disease as they traveled on riverboat(s), embarking from the Caribbean to New Orleans on 24 July 1878, moving on to Vicksburg a few days later and arriving in Memphis, where the first case occurred by 14 August (reviewed in Oldstone, 2010). At that time, no one knew that the infection was transmitted by the bite of Anopheles Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The mosquito sucks blood from an infected person, then transmits the virus by biting an uninfected susceptible person. At the time of the yellow fever outbreak in Memphis, the city population was approximately 98 000 persons. By the end of the two-month epidemic, 20 000 people had fled Memphis. Of those who stayed, 77% were infected and 70% died. The economic result was the destruction of Memphis as a commercial capital in the American South, to be replaced by Atlanta. As reported in the New York Herald newspaper by writer Robert Blakeslee, on assignment from New York City to Memphis to cover the yellow fever epidemic, \u201cThe city was almost deserted \u2026 We had not gone far, however, before the evidence of the terrible condition of things became apparent. The first thing in the shape of a vehicle that I saw was a truck (wagon), loaded with coffins, going around to collect the dead. As this was within four blocks of the depot you may imagine how soon I came to a realizing sense of the desolation. Two blocks further on, coffins were piled on tiers on the sidewalk in front of the undertaker's shop, and we were compelled to walk between them \u2026 Everyone was thoroughly frightened, a young doctor said to me. \u2019It takes a man of great moral courage to stay in this place. You talk with a man tonight and tomorrow hear that he is in the grave\u2019\u201d (reviewed in Oldstone, 2010). To those who consider this part as ancient and perhaps nonrelevant contemporary history, it is well to recall that during the 1918\u201319 influenza epidemic in the USA, over 600 000 people died in less than 2 years. In the city of Philadelphia and some other locales, the supply of coffins ran out causing the dead to be buried in mass graves. As recently as the 1980s\u201390s, a similar scenario played out in parts of Africa when the AIDS epidemic caused by HIV resulted in widely publicized mass deaths and still do in parts of Africa and Asia.",
