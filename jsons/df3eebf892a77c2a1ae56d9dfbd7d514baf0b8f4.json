The possible adverse reaction of rhinitis medicamentosa after long-term use of topical vasoconstrictors with mucosal damage should be mentioned! When selecting pharmacotherapy, the clinical symptoms should be considered. If obstruction is prominent, a combination of antihistamines, vasoconstrictors, and steroids is recommended while patients with predominant rhinorrhea usually respond well to antihistamines and anticholinergics. Mucosal dryness with increased irritability can be treated in perennial rhinitis with ointments and inhalations or lavages.",

The frequent distinction between \"extrinsic\" (= allergic) and \"intrinsic\" (no antibodies detected) is not satisfactory since the term \"intrinsic\" is ill defined and would be better replaced by \"cryptogenic.\" Mostly, the so-called infect-allergic or pathophysiologically unclear conditions are included. In intrinsic asthma, the typical signs and symptoms of atopy, such as increased serum IgE, detection of specific sensitizations in skin tests or RAST, are miss-ing. However, eosinophilia in blood and sputum is often demonstrable. Furthermore, asthma can be classified according to prognosis and therapeutic response. Intrinsic asthma responds to a lesser degree to beta-adrenergics, cromoglycate or theophylline. Sometimes, anticholinergics or ketotifen are effective; most patients, however, are glucocorticosteroid dependent [17, 20, 35] .",

In some cases, the differential diagnosis from severe chronic asthma may be difficult (Table 5 .10). The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but also other indoor air pollutants or occupational toxic exposures play a role. In contrast to bronchial asthma, COPD responds only weakly to pharmacotherapy [30] . Steroids and thiotropin are used with moderate effect. Differential diagnosis also comprises allergic bronchopulmonal aspergillosis as well as interstitial lung diseases such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (see Sect. 5.3). Functional laryngospasm, also called \"vocal cord dysfunction,\" may be triggered by physical and chemical stimuli and induce wheezing. Among the many forms of sleep apnea syndromes, there are obstructive variants similar to nightly asthma attacks.",

This form is often associated with psychosomatic stress, but is also found in combination with IgE-mediated allergy. The occurrence of urticaria factitia is variable and sometimes directly stress dependent (a female colleague of mine only had urticaria factitia on Thursdays when Prof. Braun-Falco was doing his grand rounds). I sometimes try to console my patients: \"Be glad that you are living today; some centuries ago, you would have been burnt as a witch!\" Cholinergic urticaria is characterized by the occurrence of small follicular wheals triggered by exercise, sweating, or strong psychologic stress.",

We call this phenomenon \"summation\" or \"augmentation anaphylaxis\" and think that it may be much more common than generally suspected. Possibly, this type of reaction is the rule and that explains why fortunately many sensitized individuals tolerate allergen contact without clinical incompatibility symptoms!

The most common allergens are whey proteins (beta-lactoglobulins) but also casein, which is not species-specific and shows cross reactions between cattle, goat, sheep, etc. During milk preparation, whey proteins remain in solution while casein coagulates; in spite of this, whey proteins may be present in cheese or butter as well as casein in whey. Casein is heat-stable, whereas whey proteins are partly denatured. Allergenic proteins may be denatured to different degrees by hydrolysis, leading to socalled hypoallergenic infant formulas. The term \"hypoallergenic\" is not well defined. One distinguishes between prophylactically hypoallergenic preparations (a low degree of hydrolysis) and strongly hydrolyzed products, which can be used for therapy of cow's milk allergic individuals.

After immunotherapy with a whole-body extract of homogenized honeybee, the asthma improved. Based on this report, a worldwide practice of immunotherapy of insect venom allergy with whole-body extracts started with reports of therapeutic effects in up to 75 % of cases [30] . Early evidence of possible hyposensitization with purified bee venom [17, 26] was probably not followed because of anaphylactic complications [10, 27] . Only after it was shown that bee venom and whole-body extracts contain very different allergens [23] and that the relevant allergens are in the venom [22] was hyposensitization with venom extracts proposed [9, 14, 22, 40, 43, 56] . Lichtenstein et al. pioneered the work with a double-blind study: From three groups of 20 patients each, 58 % of the placebotreated, 64 % of the whole-body extract treated, but only 5% of the bee venom extract treated patients reacted to sting challenge. This study was only possible through the production of purified venom extracts in larger amounts. Bee venom is produced by electrical stimulation of bees [5] ; wasps have to be killed, operated on, and the venom sac removed. For 500 g wasp venom, 250 collectors have to work for 1 year and need 74 million insects (= 6,000 kg).

As allergic disease, farmer's lung was classified by Pepys [24] and bagassosis by Salvaggio [28] in the 1960s after first reports by Gronemeyer in 1951. An acute and chronic form are distinguished. In the acute form, 4-6 h after exposure dyspnea with tachypnea, coughing (some- times itchy throat), fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache, tightness of the chest, as well as sputum (sometimes hemoptoe) develop. In the auscultation, a fine vesicular noise is heard, changing to rough basal noises and the typical end-expiratory rattling noise followed by fibrotic noises in inspiration (sclerosiphony) ( Table 5.45) . Chest X-ray shows small patches of nodular shadows (1 -3 mm) and milky opacification. Lung function shows restrictive ventilatory disturbance as well as disturbed diffusion capacity (diminished for CO 2 ). Decreased arterial oxygen concentrations are found, especially after exercise [34] . Blood count shows leukocytosis with deviation, sometimes eosinophilia. The differential diagnosis (Table 5 .46) includes bronchial asthma as type I reaction (sometimes elicited by similar exposure) which can be excluded by precipitating antibodies and negative IgE as well as lung function (no obstructive ventilatory disturbance). The family history of atopy is negative. In the bronchial provocation test, the reaction occurs after 4 -6 h as diffusion disturbance.",

Interestingly, this idea illustrates very well the most modern pathophysiology of dermoepidermal inflammation with the subsequent intercellular edema formation (spongiosis). The colorful spectrum of eczematous diseases may lead to confusion since definitions are given according to variable criteria (morphology, localization, route of contact, kinetics, etiology, or pathophysiology). It is most unfortunate that the term \"contact dermatitis\" only focuses on the route of elicitation and does not describe the actual difference in pathophysiology to atopic eczema, which also can be elicited by external contact (see below). Therefore the common classification as it is used in most textbooks (Table 5 .52) is not very logical. Earlier the term \"vulgar\" eczema [28] was used for contact dermatitis; however, this is not an attractive diagnosis to give a patient today. Therefore one should focus on the different characteristics between \"atopic eczema\" and \"contact dermatitis\" both pathophysiologically and clinically (Table 5 .53).",

The allergen is diluted properly (adequate concentrations have to be determined first in healthy volunteers in order to avoid toxic reactions) in an indifferent vehicle (mostly petrolatum) and fixed to a patch on the skin. Patches either are fixed in aluminum foil or aluminum chambers (Finn chambers). A new technique uses allergen-coated thin layer foils (TRUE test, thin layer rapid use epicutaneous test) [21] . After 1 or 2 days, the patch is removed. The test reaction is read after 24/48 and after 72 h and graded from 0 to +++ [0 = negative, (?) = questionable (erythema), + = weakly positive (erythema and infiltration, single papules), ++ = strongly positive (erythema, infiltrate, papules, and vesicles), +++ = very strongly positive (erythema, The \"contact allergy time\" (CAT) as the time interval needed to become sensitized against neoantigens through epidermal contact deter- mines the afferent part of the cellular immune response quantitatively [11] .",

The eczema becomes drier with increasing age, the skin shows lichenification, and in adulthood excoriated nodules (prurigo-like) (Figs. 5.43 -5.51) are common [30, 50] . Unfortunately, atopic eczema -contrary to common opinion -does not clear regularly before puberty, but two-thirds of affected children will also suffer from the disease as adults [26] ( Fig. 5.52 ). Atopic eczema may also first appear in adulthood, sometimes even in elderly persons. Atopic eczema occurs with so-called \"stigmata\" or \"minimal variants\" [30, 33, 38, 49, 52] (Table 5 . 59, Figs. 5.53, 5.54) . There is still controversy regarding the primary skin lesion, which is described as erythema, flush, papule, seropapule, or vesicle. In the tradition of St. John or J.W. von Goethe and together with the French school [5] , we say: \"In the beginning there was the itch.\" In many cases all skin lesions can be explained as secondary reactions to the itch. In children undergoing oral provocation, I have often observed that they com- (Ring 1982) . With four or more positive findings, the diagnosis \"atopic eczema\" can be made (note that by this criterion, the diagnosis \"atopic eczema\" is possible without history or laboratory tests for atopy) Eczema morphology (age-dependent) Itch Typical localization (age-dependent) Atopy stigmata Atopy in personal or family history IgE sensitization Table 5 .61 shows our diagnostic criteria from 1982: with four out of six positive parameters, the diagnosis atopic eczema can be made. Similarly in the 1990s, the \"UK-refined criteria\" [64] or the \"Millennium criteria\" [9] were developed.",

These IgE antibodies are directed against environmental allergens, in central Europe in adults most commonly against cat epithelia, housedust mite, and grass pollen, in infants against hen's eggs and cow's milk. The evaluation of the relevance of IgE sensitization for the induction or elicitation of eczema may be difficult. It is achieved by careful history and provocation tests. The detection of IgE and IgEreceptors on epidermal Langerhans cells (Fig.  5 .56) [6, 12, 55, 66] opens new perspectives for an understanding of the pathogenesis of atopic eczema (Table 5 .63). Positive epidermal test reactions induced by typical aeroallergens (e.g., housedust mites) help to show the relevance of an IgE response for the eczematous skin lesions (\"atopy patch test,\" APT) [16, 46] (Fig. 5.57 ).

Some patients under the combined influence of light and photoallergen develop a chronification, the so-called persistent light reaction, occurring with thickened erythematous lichenoid plaques and a strong itching or burning pain. Persistent light reaction is characterized by a general increase in photosensitivity in different parts of the UV spectrum. Persistent light reaction can further develop into chronic actinic dermatitis (\"actinic reticuloid\"), which may sometimes turn into cutaneous lymphoma [8, 17, 24] . In patients with persistent light reaction the minimal erythema dose (MED) is generally decreased, mostly in the UVB but also in the UVA range. Rarely there is also hypersensitivity against visible light. These patients develop inflammatory skin lesions after exposure to light, independent of allergen contact.",

Similar molecules can show \"cross-reactions\"; small molecules can elicit a reaction when they have capacity for at least divalent binding to the antibody molecule. Metabolism of drugs is important for the induction of incompatibility reactions. In the balance between activation and detoxification, disturbances may be crucial, involving especially the enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system as well as N-acetyltransferase (NAT) [34, 35] . In cutaneous drug reactions, keratinocytes also play a role with metabolizing enzymes [45] .",

It is not enough to write down the general class of drug (e.g., \"penicillin\" is often used as a wide term for any antibiotic), but the individual substance, the brand name, the producer, the formula, the batch number (especially in intravenous solutions and biologicals) should be recorded. If possible, single substances of combination drugs should be documented since the drug content may change over the years under the same brand name (Table 5 .78). The allergist also needs the \"physician's desk reference\" from previous years! Sometimes the intensity of a reaction can be evaluated from the treatment given.

The reasons for the increased prevalence of exanthematous drug eruptions in HIV infections are not clear. Besides the immanent challenge due to the multiple pharmacotherapy with drugs to be taken continuously, the use of very different and new substances with ill-defined side reactions needs to be discussed.

Nikolski I and II signs are positive. The patient is \"swimming in his own skin.\" Mucous membranes are involved, and sometimes hair loss occurs. After successful therapy, skin will heal within 2 -4 weeks with large scaling of epidermal components. Finger-and toenails may be lost. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is common. Mucosal changes heal more slowly, especially in the eye, giving rise to synechia (Fig. 5.83) . Generally, there is a severe disease (high fever!). Through the fluid loss, hypovolemia occurs, leading to shock. Superinfection may compromise other organs (pneumonia). Mucosal involvement gives rise to intestinal bleeding. Toxic changes of the liver (dystrophy, toxic fattening) and the kidneys (tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis) have been described as well as endocarditis, myocarditis, or central nervous involvement (cerebral edema, encephalomalacia) [11] .",

Drugs inducing stomatitis medicamentosa include heavy metals (mercury, gold), antibiotics (sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, streptomycin), local anesthetics, hypnotics (barbiturates, hydantoin), and analgesics (phenylbutazone, aminopyrine) [2] .",

There is considerable need for research.
