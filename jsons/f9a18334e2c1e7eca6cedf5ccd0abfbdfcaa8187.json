Another interesting finding is that the time between onset and hospitalization of the older patients who died was significantly shorter than patients who survived, which was also true in the multivariate analysis. Previous studies [10, 11] reported that the time from symptoms to dyspnea and ICU transfer were between 7 days and 9 days, respectively. It has been speculated that patients with shorter symptom duration may have a more rapid progression of the disease.

In addition, four other identified as the cause of several cases of idiopathic pneumonia in Wuhan, China [1]. On February 11, 2020, the International Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) named the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A national large sample epidemiological survey including 72,314 COVID-19 cases showed that the proportion of cases in older patients (>60 years of age) was 44.1% in Wuhan, 35.1% in Hubei (including Wuhan), and 31.2% across China (including Hubei). Of the 203 confirmed patients in this study, 55 (27.1%) were older than 65 years of age. The main clinical manifestations included fever, dry cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and muscle/joint soreness, which are consistent with the clinical manifestations reported in the previous literature [13]. Although abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dizziness are uncommon COVID-19 symptoms, the patients with these symptoms often do not display fevers during the early stages of infection. It was previously reported that the virus might be detected in stool samples, which is consistent with the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients. Hence, the viral infection may impact the digestive tract, yet additional studies are needed to determine if gastrointestinal transmission is possible.",
