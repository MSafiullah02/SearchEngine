The genome is comprised of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, a characteristic that allows reassortment during natural infection to yield new strains. These segments encode six structural viral proteins (VPs) that form virus particles and six nonstructural proteins (NSPs). The NSPs are synthesized in infected cells and interact with host proteins to influence pathogenesis and the immune response to infection.",

These particles produce capped viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are then displaced from the transcribing particles into the cell cytoplasm. There, they are then translated into proteins and replicated to new genomic RNA. This viral replication process is unique and occurs in viroplasms, electron-dense structures near the cell nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum. Newly assembled particles with newly replicated dsRNA bud into the endoplasmic reticulum from the viroplasm and are equipped with outer capsid proteins.
