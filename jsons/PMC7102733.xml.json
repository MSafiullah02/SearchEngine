First, the region tackled severe zoonotic influenza outbreaks episodes with lethal cases during the last years [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Second, the Northern Hemisphere human influenza viruses circulate in the region and are the most frequently detected respiratory viruses among pilgrims [9], increasing the risk for further spread of the disease. In addition, there is a risk of human infection from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Indeed, since 2012, outbreaks of MERS-CoV and very few sporadic travel-related cases were recorded in Saudi Arabia [10] and returning Haji [11], respectively. Although epidemiological analysis does not support human to human transmission, overcrowding, mass gathering and travel increase the fear about potential MERS-CoV international dissemination.",

Participating countries concluded that a better understanding of the factors underlying hesitancy and acceptability of the influenza vaccine is needed to devise evidence-based communication campaigns aimed at increasing vaccination coverage. The adaptation of WHO-SAGE available tools is each country has been suggested as an appropriate means to determine the underlying determinants of vaccine hesitancy in each country. The cost of the vaccine is another key barrier that could contribute to low vaccination coverage. Country representatives concluded that depending on the economic situation, countries should primarily focus on increasing vaccination coverage among known high-risk groups (diabetics, pregnant women, people with underlying chronic diseases, etc.). Some countries believed that even within the high-risk groups, a priority list should be drawn according to influenza burden in each group and each country.",
