A network of nearly 100 partner hospitals nationwide enables us to operate in a large, collaborative system in caring for more than 80,000 patients a year. This provides the ability to also develop and share local learnings and best practices. Our protocols for the care of COVID-19 patients are informed by cases and situations from several of the US epicenters, first hand experiences of our clinicians in conjunction with the bedside teams at our partner hospitals as well as data from the first cases shared out of Wuhan China.",

This does not include non-invasive ventilation (2) and other forms of oxygenation, which are generally preferred so long as they are effective. After studying the earliest cases of COVID-19 seen in Wuhan it has become increasingly clear that the use of noninvasive ventilation in treating COVID-19 was associated with deterioration to invasive ventilation while placing healthcare workers at increased risk of becoming infected (3), as the procedure can enable the virus to be aerosolized which can facilitate the further spread of the disease. The significant increase in intubated patients who require additional monitoring and management can overwhelm an already task-saturated bedside team.",

Understanding how to properly utilize a ventilator takes time to learn and knowing how to increase oxygenation levels appropriately becomes as much art as it is science. This is one of the many areas where tele-ICU support can make a significant difference. A critical care specialist with years of training and experience is able to virtually enter the room with a bedside nurse, respiratory therapist (RT), or provider and walk them through various modes and methods of ventilation, providing real-time support while evaluating for the patient\u2019s response to vent changes. After being placed on a ventilator, patients can be assigned to a tele-ICU Respiratory Therapist (RT) who safely performs virtual rounds using high-definition audio/visual equipment, gathering information and providing a constant and clear flow of that information to ensure appropriate patient vent management with minimal virus exposure for bedside clinicians.",

As time is of the essence, the ability to deliver an intensivist to the room via A/V technology within seconds, much sooner than a bedside provider might be able to get there, can initiate life-saving treatments when seconds matter. Typically, running a code involves an \u201call hands on deck\u201d approach, with care team members running into the room to be led in response by an on-site physician. When faced with the realities of COVID-19 patient isolation and PPE requirements, code leadership by a tele-ICU intensivist has allowed the number of staff responding on-site to be reduced to essential personnel only. The teleintensivist provides the bedside clinicians with an additional set of eyes as well as a clinician that is removed from the inherent chaos of the situation. An Intensivist\u2019s experience can provide needed expertise and leadership during this critical time.",

            "text": "With patients isolated on such a grand scale due to COVID-19, we are finding new clinical considerations that tele-ICU adapts to address them. Paramount among these is a widely-observed increase in patient loneliness, as clinicians are strapped for time, slowed by the need to don personal protective equipment (PPE), and dissuaded by frequent patient visits due to the risk of virus exposure. Beyond providing clinical expertise and 24/7 monitoring, tele-ICU stands with the bedside team as first line of care for patients. As the pandemic spreads in the U.S., we quickly worked with client teams and technology suppliers to enable local use of the tele-ICU A/V equipment. Access that had been utilized by tele-ICU clinicians is now being shared with physicians and nurses within the hospital to visit patients virtually to decrease the frequency and need to physically enter an isolation room. Collaboration between tele-ICU and bedside teams has helped to minimize the use of PPE and limit unnecessary exposure of the bedside team to the contagious virus. Tele-ICU nurse practitioners have increased their video check-ins to provide additional support to the patients and provide human connection and emotional support to patients during a time of significant stress. Even hospital chaplains, social workers, and housekeeping have leveraged the tele-ICU technology to provide essential services to patients while maintaining minimal physical contact. Standard workflows are being modified to make room for more physician to physician conversations and consultations and adjusting to the immediate needs that are arising during the outbreak while providing best practices to help stem the tide of this wave.",
