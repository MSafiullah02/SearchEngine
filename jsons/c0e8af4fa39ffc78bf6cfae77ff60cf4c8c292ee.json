Virus whole genome sequencing was conducted for the SARS-CoV-2 isolate (NTU03) from her throat swab collected on March 2, 2020. The derived NTU03 sequence was most similar to clade A2a with only 5 nucleotide differences, which included 2 synonymous mutations (Orf 1b/5410 CTA>TTA, and orf 3a/819 GTG>GTT), 2 nonsynonymous mutations (Orf 1b/799 G>V, and orf 3a/57Q>H), and a mutation within 5'UTR (Table) . An average of 12 nucleotide differences were observed between NTU03 and sequences of other clades, whereas an average of 10 nucleotide differences were observed with other previous viruses isolated from Taiwan. The phylogenetic analysis also reveals that the NTU03 belongs to clade A2a (Figure) . With the limited transmission clusters in Taiwan and the fact that NTU03 exhibits at least 8 unique nucleotide difference compared to other previously reported viruses from Taiwan, we conclude that it is much more probable that the present patient was infected during her travelling abroad. To our best knowledge, in late and its relationship to other viral sequences derived from case patients identified in Taiwan (red arrows).
