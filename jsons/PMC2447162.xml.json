            "text": "The genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae consists of 28 viruses, most of which cycle between mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts. Several alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), O'nyong-nyong virus and Chikungunya virus, can cause severe disease in humans, that typically includes fever and neurological sequelae (Griffin, 2007). Of these, VEEV is the most important human pathogen, with several recent outbreaks consisting of hundreds of thousands of cases occurring mostly in Latin America (Weaver et al., 2004). Furthermore, EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are considered bioterrorist threats because they cause severe disease in humans, can be produced in large quantity and/or are potentially transmitted by aerosol (Hawley and Eitzen, 2001, Sidwell and Smee, 2003). Veterinary vaccines of varying quality against EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are commercially available, but only IND preparations are approved for human use and their availability is limited to military and laboratory personnel. No therapeutic for alphavirus-induced disease exists, although supportive treatment and anti-inflammatory drugs may be beneficial. Recently short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to be effective against the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus (Caplen et al., 2002) and VEEV (O'Brien, 2006), in cell cultures, and against O'nyong-nyong virus replication in its natural mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae (Keene et al., 2004).",

The open reading frames are flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of approximately (\u223c) 60 and \u223c 300 nucleotides, respectively. The nonstructural proteins are translated from the full-length genomic RNA and are utilized to produce a full-length negative-strand antigenomic RNA. The negative-strand intermediate is used as template to produce both full-length positive-strand, and, using a 24 nucleotide internal promoter, a \u223c 4 kb subgenomic RNA is produced, which is identical in sequence to the 3\u2032 terminal third of the genomic RNA. The structural proteins are translated from the subgenomic RNA. Both genomic and subgenomic RNA are 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated. Sindbis virus (SINV) has been extensively used as a model alphavirus because of its low pathogenicity to humans, easy propagation in a variety of cell lines, and molecular biology that is considered representative of the genus (Strauss and Strauss, 1994).",

            "text": "Antisense oligomers of various structural types have been used to interfere with gene expression of several human viral pathogens (Schubert and Kurreck, 2006), and a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide designed to target mRNA of cytomegalovirus (CMV) that is intended to treat CMV-induced retinitis is an approved drug (De Clercq, 2004). However, antisense therapeutic technology continues to be hampered by limitations in both oligomer stability and delivery to RNA targets within relevant cells (Kurreck, 2003). Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are a class of oligonucleotide-like antisense agents that possess the same four bases as DNA, but contain a different backbone. The deoxyribose ring and phosphodiester linkage of DNA are replaced by a morpholine ring and phosphorodiamidate linkage in PMO (Summerton and Weller, 1997). PMO are nonionic, are stable in cellular extracts and human serum (Nelson et al., 2005, Youngblood et al., 2007) and typically are synthesized to a length of 20\u201325 subunits. The PMO mechanism of antisense action is via steric-blocking of complementary RNA sequence (Stein et al., 1997), and thus differs from that of antisense agents based on DNA chemistry, which induce RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA strand of a RNA\u2013DNA duplex, or RNAi/siRNA involving double-stranded agents that recognize target mRNA and induce its degradation by cellular proteins (Masiero et al., 2007). PMO covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) can be delivered efficiently into cells (Deas et al., 2005, Moulton et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2006). CPP-PMO are water-soluble and have been shown to generate potent inhibition of several RNA viruses, including dengue virus (Holden et al., 2006, Kinney et al., 2005), West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2005), SARS Coronavirus (Neuman et al., 2005), Equine Arterivirus (van den Born et al., 2005) and influenza virus (Ge et al., 2006) in cell culture, and Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006), Ebola virus (Enterlein et al., 2006), murine Coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007) and West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2007) both in cell culture and in mouse models. Two different CPP-conjugated PMO (PPMO), one containing oligoarginine (P3) and one containing 6-aminohexanoic acid (P7), have been utilized (Moulton et al., 2004, Abes et al., 2006). A recent report documented that P7-conjugated PPMO are highly stable in human serum for at least 2 hours (h), and moderately stable for 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007).",

We found that two PPMO, one targeting the 5\u2032-terminal sequence and the other targeting the first functional AUG translation start site regions of the genome, were effective in blocking viral production. Subsequently, PPMO were designed to target the two corresponding regions in VEEV. As for the SINV PPMO, VEEV-specific PPMO were found to inhibit the replication of several VEEV strains in cell cultures and were efficacious in a murine model of VEE.",

            "text": "Considerations in PPMO sequence design for this study included our current understanding of the function of various alphavirus genetic regions, and PPMO mechanism of action. As with other positive-strand viruses that utilize cap-dependent translation, access of trans-acting proteins to the 5\u2032 terminal region of the genome is critical to alphavirus capping reactions and the process of translation pre-initiation (Vasiljeva et al., 2000). It has also been shown by mutational studies that certain sequence and secondary structure requirements in the 5\u2032 terminal region of the alphavirus genome must be present for efficient viral replication to occur (Frolov et al., 2001, Gorchakov et al., 2004, Niesters and Strauss, 1990, Tsiang et al., 1988). The 3\u2032 terminal region of the antigenome has likewise been shown to play an integral role in positive-strand synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001), perhaps through the presence of a stem-loop structure corresponding to the inverse of that present in the 5\u2032 end of the genome. Specific sequence requirements in the 19 nucleotide 3\u2032 conserved sequence element (3\u2032CSE) immediately preceding the polyA tail are necessary for efficient minus-strand synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001). Another study reported high antiviral activity from PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminal region of the Equine Arterivirus genome, and moderate activity with PPMO targeting either the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome or 3\u2032 terminus of the antigenome (van den Born et al., 2005), although the 5\u2032 end of the antigenome was not included as a target. Other groups have also reported high efficacy by PPMO targeting the genomic 5\u2032 terminal region of other positive-strand viruses, including dengue (Kinney et al., 2005), West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2005), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Zhang et al., 2006) and murine Coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007). The above reports documenting the importance of sequence and structures in terminal regions of the alphavirus genome, along with the success of termini-targeted PPMO, led us to design PPMO against each of the four termini of SINV genomic RNA (Fig. 1\n). Alphavirus subgenomic (sg) RNA encoding the structural proteins is synthesized by internal initiation on the genome-length negative-strand RNA. The minimal sequence essential for promoter activity extends from nucleotide \u221219 to +5 (in relation to the start codon of the sg positive-strand) and corresponds to the genomic positive-strand sequence from nucleotides 7579 to 7602 in SINV (Levis et al., 1990). We therefore targeted this core-promoter region in the antigenome, in an effort to interfere with the synthesis of plus-strand sg RNA. The genomic 5\u2032-most AUG codon is required for translation initiation of the nonstructural proteins of alphaviruses (Lemm et al., 1994). The region flanking the translation start site has been a favored target site for PMO mediated silencing of viral (Enterlein et al., 2006, Neuman et al., 2005, van den Born et al., 2005) and cellular (Heasman, 2002, Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000) mRNAs, and was an obvious PPMO target selection. Three of the six sites we initially chose to target with PPMO are regions of highly conserved sequence either between alphavirus species, or between strains within a species: (i) the CSE at the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome (ii) the sg core-promoter region and (iii) the 5\u2032 terminal region (Lemm et al., 1994).",

SinLuc virus was harvested following electroporation of BHK cells with in vitro transcribed SinLuc RNA. Prior to infection with SinLuc virus BHK cells were treated with SINV P3-PPMO in the concentration range that was demonstrated to be non-cytotoxic in the cell viability experiment (shown in Fig. 2A). For quantitative comparison, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the luc levels for all groups (PPMO or untreated control at all concentrations via two way ANOVA, \u03b1\n = 0.05) as well as pairwise comparison of luc levels for SINV PPMO treatments or untreated (\u201cNo PPMO\u201d) at each concentration to the corresponding Scr treatment (Bonferroni's post-test, \u03b1\n = 0.05). Dose-responsive inhibition of SINV replication, as represented by luc readings, was observed for both the SINV 5\u2032+ PPMO (Fig. 3\nA, right panel) and SINV AUG PPMO (3A, left panel). For the SINV AUG PPMO, at 5, 7.5 and 10 \u03bcM this reduction was in the range of 70\u201390% relative to Scr and was statistically significant (p-values < 0.01). For the SINV 5\u2032+, a reduction of 85\u2013100% with the dose tested in the range of 0.5\u201310 \u03bcM was significant (p-values < 0.001). In contrast, the level of inhibition produced by the SINV 5\u2032-, 3\u2032+ and 3\u2032- PPMO was similar at all concentrations, and these levels were significantly different from Scr PPMO (p-values < 0.01); however, this reduction (%) did not appear to be dose dependent. For the SgP, no significant differences were detected at the majority of the concentrations tested, with the exception of 0.1 and 7.5 \u03bcM. However, at 0.1 \u03bcM, for all groups (PPMO or untreated controls), the luc values were generally higher relative to Scr, but were not statistically different from Scr (p-values > 0.05). Thus, significant dose-responsive inhibition was observed for the SINV 5\u2032+ and SINV AUG PPMO.",

At both time points, viral titers of the VEEV 5+ or VEEV AUG-treated cultures were below the limit of detection (0.6 log10 PFU/ml) for all VEEV strains.

No deaths occurred in the group of uninfected mice receiving VEEV-specific PPMO before and after infection (8/8, 100% survival), indicating that this dosing regimen was well-tolerated. In the VEEV-infected groups, there were no survivors in the group receiving both pre- and post-infection treatment with Scr PPMO (0%, 0/10). In contrast, 100% (8/8) of the group receiving both pre- and post-infection treatment with VEEV 5+ and VEEV AUG PPMO survived while 63% (5/8) of the group receiving only post-infection treatment with the VEEV-specific PPMO survived. There was a statistically significant difference among all survival curves (logrank, p\n < 0.0001).

At all time points tested, VEEV was undetectable in the blood, brain, and peripheral tissues (liver, lung and spleen) of mice that received the VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO pre- and post-infection (+pre/+post) treatments. In mice that received only post-infection (\u2212pre/+post) 5\u2032+ PPMO treatment, reduction in VEEV titer varied, depending upon the tissue examined. In the blood, VEEV titers for the VEEV 5\u2032+ treated groups were similar to those of the mock-treated mice at days 2 and 3 pi, but over 2 logs lower than mock-treated on day 4 (Fig. 5B, panel i). In the brain, the VEEV 5\u2032+ group treated following infection (\u2212pre/+post) showed higher titer at day 2, but lower titer at days 3 and 4 compared to the mock-treated group (Fig. 5B, panel ii); notably, on 4 dpi, VEEV titers for the \u2212pre/+post VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO was reduced to 80 PFU/g tissue, a level near the limit of detection in this assay of 60 PFU/g. Compared to mock-treated mice, the average liver titers in the mice receiving \u2212pre/+post VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO following infection was about 1 log10 higher at 2 dpi, and about 2 log10 less at 3 and 4 dpi, (Fig. 5B, panel iii). Spleen titers in the group receiving VEEV 5\u2032+ treatment following infection were similar to mock-treated mice at 2 dpi, somewhat lower than mock at 3 dpi, and considerably lower (undetectable) than mock at 4 dpi (Fig. 5B, panel iv). Lung titers were similarly low for mice treated \u2212pre/+post VEEV with 5\u2032+ and mock-treated mice at 2 and 3 dpi, while at 4 dpi, mock-treated mice had an average titer of \u223c 4 log10 while both PPMO treatment groups had undetectable titers (Fig. 5B, panel v).",

The antiviral efficacy of PPMO targeted to various locations in the 5\u2032 end of the genome of positive-strand RNA viruses has been observed for Nidoviruses (Neuman et al., 2005, van den Born et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2006), Flaviviruses (Deas et al., 2005, Kinney et al., 2005), and Picornaviruses (Vagnozzi et al., 2007, Yuan et al., 2006). It remains undetermined why four of the six SINV PPMO in this study were relatively ineffective. Future studies may evaluate other regions of alphavirus sequence as prospective PPMO targets, including the 5\u2032 terminal- and AUG-regions of the subgenomic RNA. Results from cell culture (Fig. 3C) and in cell-free translation assays (Fig. 3D) indicate that both active PPMO identified in this study can directly interfere with viral translation. The lack of activity by several PPMO incidentally provides confirmation of the specificity of the inhibitory action of the effective PPMO. In addition, these experiments did not reveal any non-specific toxicity associated with PPMO chemistry, which would be reflected in overall lowered luciferase (Fig. 3A), plaque (Fig. 3B), or viral protein production (Fig. 3C) in comparison with untreated or Scr controls. Further evidence of the lack of toxicity of this compound is provided by cell viability assays for all PPMO used (Fig. 2), the relatively low inhibitory activity of VEEV-specific PPMO against VSV (Fig. 4A), the control (Scr) PPMO employed throughout this study, and the uncompromised health of PPMO-treated (uninfected) mice (Fig. 5A).",

Additionally, a 20-mer PMO of random sequence having 50% G/C content (named 'Scr\u2019) was conjugated to either P3 or P7 peptide for use as a control for non-sequence-specific activity of the two respective PPMO chemistries. To preclude unintentional hybridization events, antisense and negative control PPMO sequences were screened via BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) against primate and murine mRNA sequences. In addition, the negative control was screened against all published alphavirus sequences. PPMO targeted to human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14) were used as additional controls for SINV in vitro translation experiments. Prior to use, lyophilized PPMO were suspended with filter-sterilized distilled water to a concentration of 1\u20132 mM, and stored at 4 \u00b0C.",

Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with the indicated strain of VEEV (TC-83, SH3, ZPC738, or 68U201) or, as a negative control, with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for 2 h prior to the addition of the indicated PPMO at 5 \u03bcM. At 8 (left) or 24 hpi (right), supernatants were harvested for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. The VEEV serotype is indicated in parentheses. SH3 and TC-83 are epizootic (or epizootic derivative) strains; 68U201 and ZPC738 are enzootic strains. The horizontal line depicts the limit of detection. Asterisk (\u204e) indicates that no virus was detected for any sample in that group. The result of a single experiment is shown. B) PPMO dose\u2013response inhibition of VEEV. Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with VEEV (TC-83 strain) for 1 h prior to the addition of the indicated AMCA-conjugated PPMO at doses in the range of 0.5 to 7.5 \u03bcM. At various time points post-infection (indicated in graph), supernatants were harvested for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. The result of a single experiment is shown. C) Effect of VEEV PPMO on VEEV and on the control virus, VSV (eight replicates). Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with VEEV (TC-83 strain), or as a control, with VSV, for 1 h prior to the addition of the indicated P7-AMCA-conjugated PPMO at 5 \u03bcM. Supernatants were harvested at 8 and 24 hpi for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay, performed in eight replicates at each time point for VEEV or VSV. Statistical analysis was performed on log10-transformed viral titer values comparing all treatments using one-way analysis of variance (\u03b1 = 0.05, GraphPad Prism). Pairwise comparison of the log10-titer values by treatment group was performed using Bonferroni post-test. Bars with asterisk indicate a statistically significant difference (Bonferroni, p-value < 0.001). The average percent change was calculated from log10 titers as: 100 \u204e (VEEV PPMO-average control) \u00f7 average control. A summary table showing the average percent change, relative to either the untreated (\u201cNo PPMO\u201d) or Scr controls is shown. D) Effect of combined VEEV 5\u2032+ and VEEV AUG PPMO on VEEV. Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with VEEV (TC-83 strain), or as a control, with VSV, for 1 h prior to the addition of the indicated P7-AMCA-conjugated PPMO at 7.5 and 10 \u03bcM (each PPMO). Supernatants were harvested at 8 and 24 hpi (and for VSV, at 8, 24, and 48 hpi) for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. The result of a single experiment is shown.",

Treatment groups are indicated in the figure legend, as follows: 1) AUG and 5\u2032+ (+pre, +post)/no VEEV: VEEV-specific PPMO at time points prior to (+pre) and following (+post) infection; graph symbol \u25cb, 2) No PPMO/+VEEV: no treatment of VEEV-infected mice; graph symbol +, 3) Scr (+pre, +post)/+VEEV: Scr treatment at pre- and post-infection time points; graph symbol \u2666, 4) AUG and 5\u2032+ (+pre, +post)/+VEEV: VEEV-specific PPMO at pre- and post-infection time points; graph symbol \u25b2, 5) AUG and 5\u2032+ (\u2212pre, +post)/+VEEV: VEEV-specific PPMO at post-infection time points only; graph symbol \u0394. On day 0, mice were infected via i.n. route with virulent VEEV (ZPC738) at a dose of 103 PFU per animal (groups 2\u20136). As a control for P7-PPMO toxicity, group 1 was treated with VEEV-specific P7-PPMO in an identical manner as group 4, but was not infected with VEEV. Mice were observed daily and deaths recorded over a 28-day period following infection. B) Infectious virus levels in the tissues of no PPMO or VEEV-specific PPMO-treated mice. Randomly pre-selected mice (N = 5 per group) from groups receiving no PPMO treatment (group 2) or VEEV-specific PPMO treatment (groups 4 and 5), described for panel A, were euthanized at 2, 3 and 4 days post-infection (dpi) for harvest of blood, brain and peripheral organs (liver, spleen and lung). Infectious virus levels were determined via plaque assay. The horizontal line depicts the limit of detection. Asterisk (\u204e) indicates that no virus was detected for any organ sample tested in the respective group.",
