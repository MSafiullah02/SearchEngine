In addition, some of these microorganisms may colonize the surface or internal parts of plants and animals, thereby providing an additional level of interaction complexity. These microbial relations range from intraspecific to interspecific interactions, and from simple short-term interactions to intricate long-term ones. They have played a key role in the formation of plant and animal kingdoms, often resulting in coevolution; they control the size, activity level, and diversity patterns of microbial communities. Therefore, they modulate trophic networks and biogeochemical cycles, regulate ecosystem productivity, and determine the ecology and health of plant and animal partners. A better understanding of these interactions is needed to develop microbe-based ecological engineering strategies for environmental sustainability and conservation, to improve environment-friendly approaches for feed and food production, and to address health challenges posed by infectious diseases.

Thus, even though individuals have constantly disappeared and the species succeeded each other, the main types of living beings continue to exist to this day, whether they appeared 3 billion years ago or recently. The most striking example is provided by prokaryotes, which have remained ubiquitous and diversified in all areas of the world, despite the emergence of all kinds of unicellular or multicellular organisms. The evolution of life has led to the emergence of multiple interactions between all levels of organization, the first species to appear also taking advantage of the emergence of new ones, as shown, for example, by the colonization of eukaryotes by prokaryotes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 103, "text": "(Gould 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Interactions are so much the rule that we may even wonder if, in a given ecosystem -inasmuch as there is unity of place and time -there are living species not interacting directly or indirectly with other species.

This concept of unity, of which Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire was the defender in the middle of the nineteenth century, is evidenced, for example, by the construction of proteins from a list determined once and for all of 20 amino acids, by the similarities of metabolic pathways and biophysical processes, and of course by the universal genetic code. The ability of a transposon to insert foreign DNA, the ability for bacteria to invade animal tissues, the ability of Toxoplasma (protozoan) to manipulate the behavior of a rodent, and the possibility of limitless pairwise interactions are all further evidence that life probably arose only once, or at least only the descendants of a particular life form survived (cf. Sect. 2.1). For example, any pathogen and its host share a common ancestor. The result is that signals can be exchanged between organisms whose common ancestor existed billions of years ago, and this might explain why a pathogen can use and manipulate to his advantage the biochemical processes of its host. What has changed throughout evolution is the complexity of organisms, but not the basis for their functioning or the nature of the molecular signaling pathways: this could only facilitate the establishment of multiple interactions (Table 11 .1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1350, "end": 1359, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "2.7 billion years ago, cyanobacteria developed molecular tools allowing photosynthesis, a feature that allows us to divide most living beings into two major groups, photosynthetic organisms such as algae and green plants that get their energy from the sun and those who, directly or indirectly, derive their energy from the former. Food chains and webs in ecosystems are essentially based on these two types of organisms, typically referred to as primary producers (comprising also chemoautotrophic bacteria such as nitrifiers) and consumers, respectively, as well as on microbial decomposers. These food webs involve several types of conflictual interactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflictual Interactions"}, {"text": "Conflictual interactions within ecosystems are of multiple types. They can be classified according to trophic level, distinguishing, e.g., primary consumers (such as herbivores), secondary consumers (e.g., carnivores that eat herbivores), etc. We can distinguish the interactions between organisms from different trophic levels from interactions between individuals at the same trophic level, which may lead to intra-or interspecific competition. Competition* is an interaction in which partners use the same resource, whether nutrients, water, or even space. Intraspecific competition can be particularly intense, when the partners involved have needs that are very close and use comparable if not identical means for the resource acquisition. Competition can also occur between individuals belonging to different trophic levels, and even different kingdoms, such as the competition for nitrate between plant roots and microorganisms in soil. Competition is sometimes assisted by the production of toxic compounds in the environment, such as bacteriocins or antibiotics. It corresponds to interference competition*, which relies on chemical warfare mechanisms, to be distinguished from competition by exploitation. The distinction between the two types of competition is sometimes difficult to establish. Another difficulty lies in the distinction between interference competition and another conflictual interaction, amensalism*. Amensalism (synonym of antagonism) is an interaction that has a negative effect on one partner but no effect on the other. Amensalism assumes that the two species do not compete significantly with each other. Amensalism is based on a physical or chemical modification of the environment and, in the latter case, often involves the release of toxic compounds. Thus, the production of antibiotics (i.e., antibiosis) may correspond to interference competition or antagonism, depending on the nature of the partner affected and on the energy invested in the synthesis of these secondary metabolites. Allelopathy, i.e., the synthesis by a higher organism of compounds bioactive on another higher organism, is conceptually close to antibiosis and deserves to be mentioned in this chapter because microorganisms can metabolize some of these compounds and thus interfere with the interaction.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflictual Interactions"}, {"text": "Finally, there are two types of conflictual interactions for which the interaction is negative for one partner but beneficial for the other, i.e., predation and parasitism. Predation* is of short duration (a cat that eats a mouse or a protozoan that feeds on a bacterium) and usually leads to destruction of the genetic information of the prey (in this case the mouse or the bacterium). Parasitism* is sustained in time (the parasite in its host) and the genetic informations of the partners remain in intimate contact over time; here we recognize the traditional distinction between predator-prey and parasite-host relationships. The predator is free, while the parasite is physically associated with its host, at least for part of its life cycle. It should be noted that the importance of signals is very different in the two types of interactions. When a cat chases a mouse, signals are visual, auditory, or olfactory, and they last only the duration of the hunt. When a virus or bacterium settles in a host, the exchange of molecular signals can persist for months or years, for example, involving the immune system of the host and processes by which pathogens circumvent these defenses. One of the most amazing aspects of these sustainable interactions is manipulation: Toxoplasma are parasitic protozoa whose complex life cycle requires them, when they are in a rodent, to pass into a cat to perform their sexual reproduction; Toxoplasma settles in the nerve cells of the rodent and induces in them a suicidal attraction to cats, as well as altered social behavior. Although we do not know the precise mechanisms involved, it is clear that this manipulation of rodent behavior must rely on biochemical compounds produced by Toxoplasma. The more research is done on it, the more manipulation appears to be widespread -the result of natural selection -in pathogen-host interactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflictual Interactions"}, {"text": "Some interactions, unlike the previous ones in which conflict predominates, provide benefits to the different partners. Among beneficial interactions, commensalism* is the only one for which the positive effects are exerted on only one of the two partners. This interaction is therefore the counterpart of amensalism. Cooperation* is a mutually beneficial, facultative relationship, this facultative aspect distinguishing it from symbiosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Beneficial Interactions"}, {"text": "In the case of mutualism* or symbiosis (Box 11.1), both species benefit from the interaction. It is interesting to note that, as in conflictual interactions, genetic distance is not a barrier to partnership: one can observe mutualistic interactions between plants and animals, bacteria and vertebrates, and fungi and plants; a complete list would be endless. Mutualistic interactions have played a very important role in evolution ( Fig. 11.1 ). Mitochondria and chloroplasts -and certainly other structures -of eukaryotic cells are nothing more than ancient bacteria. In fact, the modern eukaryotic cell, the cornerstone of all multicellular organisms, can be seen as a collection of bacteria. Such interactions are also reversible: for example, the agent of malaria, the Plasmodium protozoan, has lost its chloroplasts (which its ancestors had, as indicated by recently discovered remnants of these chloroplasts), the same way tapeworms lost their gut.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 433, "end": 442, "text": "Fig. 11.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Beneficial Interactions"}, {"text": "It should be added that the distinction between parasitism and mutualism is not always easy to make. In some cases it is difficult to measure mutual benefits; in other cases we can question the \"honesty\" of the interaction. To cite just one example, many organisms living in deep ocean hydrothermal ecosystems harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria that provide the bulk of their energy resources. This interaction can be seen as a simple exchange of protection against food, but if we take into account that the host regularly consumes part of the bacterial population, one can also see true parasitism. The length of the interaction is not an absolute guarantee of peace between the partners. For instance, \"mitochondrial bacteria,\" which in sexually reproducing organisms are usually transmitted to zygotes by females, \"endeavor\" to skew the sex ratio at the expense of males.

The word protosymbiosis is also used, when the relationship is with little mutual benefit as in the case of yogurt where Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus coexist without strong metabolic complementarity. The term associative symbiosis is also used as a synonym for cooperation, especially in the case of saprophytic microorganisms in the rhizosphere that enhance plant growth.

Of course, this totally peaceful interaction is made possible by the perfect genetic similarity of the cells constituting the group.

Arms races represent one of the fundamental drivers of evolution, because selective pressures that organisms exert on each other remain the sine qua non of evolutionary change. In a 1973 paper, the American evolutionist Leigh Van Valen gave for this driver of evolution an explanation known as the Red Queen hypothesis, which has become a classic ( Fig. 11 .2). He suggested that changes constantly generate new adaptations to meet adaptations in the competing species; if species share, even partially, the same spatial or energy resources, and if one of them increases its fitness, the other species have then to compensate for this adaptive advantage or else will disappear. Species that adapt will in turn modify the fitness of the others; and so forth, says Van Valen, life is in a self-sustaining perpetual movement.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 424, "end": 431, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Dynamics of Interactions"}, {"text": "Van Valen's hypothesis leads to the concept that humans and bacteria, although differing profoundly in their complexity, may be equally adapted to their environment.

However, as we have seen, even an interaction as ancient as that of the eukaryotic cell with mitochondria is not without discordant notes.

One of them, particularly formidable, is their very short generation time, inherited from the early ages of life, which can lead to high production of individuals with mutated genes. In contrast, hosts of microbial parasites must compose with one major constraint that evolution has imposed onto multicellular organisms, i.e., their long generation time. Indeed, the advent of multicellularity was accompanied by increased body size, which resulted also, inevitably, in longer generation time. While the time between two divisions, thus opportunities for mutations and selection, is sometimes counted in minutes in bacteria, many multicellular organisms only acquire the ability to reproduce, and thus to mutate, after several years (somatic Fig. 11 .1 Plant cell comprising a nucleus (gray) originating from an ancestor such as Thermoplasma (a), mitochondria (red) originating from an ancestor such as an alphaproteobacterium (b), chloroplasts (green) originating from an ancestor such as cyanobacteria (c) (Redrawn from John H. Miller (jhmiller@uh.edu)) mutations that arise during development and postembryonic life are not transmitted and are thus useless for evolution). This issue is discussed by Ochman and Wilson (1987) . They argue that replication is not the only time when mutations occur; instead these may occur at any time over the lifespan of organisms.

The microbial numbers in the plant are generally low (10 2-5 bacteria per g), except for some endophytic bacteria (up to 10 8 per g) and especially symbionts and parasites, when they are engaged in a successful interaction with the host (McInroy and Kloepper 1995; Gamboa et al. 2003 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 157, "text": "(Gamboa et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 531, "end": 546, "text": "(Brundrett 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 651, "end": 672, "text": "(Bertaux et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1366, "text": "Gamboa et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 385, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Location and Population Levels of Microorganisms Associated with Plants"}, {"text": "Microorganisms interacting with plants have various provenances. First, many originate from soil. They can find themselves in contact with plants if they are present in an area of the soil that is penetrated by a root. However, many terrestrial microorganisms have the ability to actively come into contact with seeds or roots, through a process of chemotaxis (for bacteria) or chemotropism (for fungi) triggered by the perception of plant exudates (Bais et al. 2006) . Terrestrial microorganisms in contact with plants will mostly be associated to the root system, but some may colonize plant shoots or fruits. This situation is mainly documented for pathogens, including fungi such as Fusarium spp. (Deuteromycetes) that produce mycotoxins (Leplat et al. 2013) . Second, certain microorganisms that interact with plants come in contact with the plant through precipitation and irrigation water, the fall of atmospheric dust, or wind (Agrios 1997; Morris et al. 2010) . Precipitations also lead to runoff events along the aerial parts of the plants and the soil surface. This runoff will lead to a redistribution of some phyllospheric microorganisms. The presence of microorganisms in the atmosphere can be explained by the formation of aerosols, i.e., microdroplets, which originate from liquid phases that are turbulent or that face convection, e.g., by wind. This presence can also be explained by the transportation, caused by wind or air currents, of microorganisms or microparticles colonized by microorganisms, including for resting stages such as many fungal spores (Savage et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 467, "text": "(Bais et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 742, "end": 762, "text": "(Leplat et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 935, "end": 948, "text": "(Agrios 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 949, "end": 968, "text": "Morris et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1595, "text": "(Savage et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sources of Microorganisms Associated with Plants"}, {"text": "Third, animals can act as carriers of microorganisms.

In comparison with non-rhizosphere soil, the rhizosphere has specific physical and (bio) chemical features. From a physical point of view, the root surface is not homogeneous in terms of topography and rhizodeposit flux, noticeably with the occurrence of a groove and the preferential release of exudates at the junction of epidermal cells (Beattie and Lindow 1999) . The level of hydrophobicity of the root surface (and thus its contact properties) may vary depending on the plant considered. Root growth results in the creation of a root-based soil macroporosity, which leads to compaction of the rhizospheric soil. It is also in the rhizosphere that diffusion of soluble rhizodeposits occurs, resulting in stimulation of microbial populations. Insoluble rhizodeposits render the mucigel gelatinous, which facilitates adhesion between root and soil particles. The mucigel also affects water movement in the rhizosphere, thereby modulating the availability of water to roots. From a chemical point of view, the properties of the rhizosphere are largely related to the presence of rhizodeposits (formerly referred to as root exudates). Depending on the mode of release of rhizodeposits in the soil ( Fig. 11 .8), we distinguish exudates (in the modern sense of the term) or diffusates (soluble or gaseous lowmolecular-weight compounds released by passive transport), secretions (compounds actively transported out of the root cells), cell lysates (compounds released during the lysis of epidermal cells, cortical cells, or senescent sloughed-off cells detached from the root cap), and the mucigel (plant polysaccharides, to which microbial exopolysaccharides can be added) (Nguyen 2003) . Quantitatively, the rhizodeposits represent 15-20 % of the net organic carbon from photosynthesis, i.e., about half the organic carbon translocated to roots (Nguyen 2003) . The organic rhizodeposits have a high functional and chemical diversity. They include the following: 1. Simple substrates, namely, a very large number of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, fatty acids, sterols, nucleic acid derivatives, etc. 2. Insoluble polymers (cellulose and other carbohydrates) 3. Vitamins and other growth factors (biotin, inositol, thiamine, etc.) 4. Phytohormones (auxins, cytokinins, etc.) 5. Enzymatic proteins (amylases, phosphatases, proteases, etc.) 6. Toxins (e.g., calystegines) and defense compounds (such as phytoalexins and glucosinolates) 7. Signals acting on microorganisms as chemoattractants (sugars, organic acids, etc.) and/or transcription inducers (e.g., flavonoids), etc. (Bais et al. 2006 ). The rhizosphere exhibits other chemical particularities, which are also related to root functioning. Plant nutrition requires selective uptake of mineral nutrients by roots, which leads to accumulation and sometimes also precipitation (e.g., calcium carbonate or iron oxide) of excess constituents and especially depletion for metabolized nutrients (to a larger extent for soluble anions such as nitrate than for poorly soluble anions such as phosphate or for cations) in the rhizosphere. Cations and anions uptake involves parallel excretion of proton or hydroxide anion, respectively, which can lead to local pH change in the rhizosphere (Hinsinger et al. 2003) . Finally, root (and microbial) respiration may lead to a decrease in oxygen concentration, with a parallel increase in carbon dioxide content, in particular, when soil is very wet. However, these processes can be offset by the ease of gas exchange in the root macroporosity. This is particularly the case in soils containing swelling clays, which retract during drying. It can be noted that certain plants that thrive in submerged conditions (e.g., rice) can release oxygen through their roots (Liesack et al. 2000) . Depending on these factors, the availability of oxygen in the root zone will be lower (most often) or higher than in non-rhizosphere soil.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 537, "text": "(Beattie and Lindow 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1858, "text": "(Nguyen 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2031, "text": "(Nguyen 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2768, "text": "(Bais et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3435, "text": "(Hinsinger et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3931, "end": 3952, "text": "(Liesack et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1372, "end": 1379, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Ecological Factors"}, {"text": "To colonize plants, a microorganism must not only use the trophic resources they provide (in a context of competition with the rest of the microbial community) but also tolerate abiotic stress conditions (including desiccation and UV in the phyllosphere) as well as toxins and other host defense compounds.

This selection process is amplified by the molecular dialogues with the plant, including microbial chemotaxis/chemotropism phenomena (cf. Sect. 9.2) and the ability of certain plants to interfere with bacterial quorum sensing (Bauer and Robinson 2002) . Finally, all terrestrial microorganisms are not affected the same way by the antimicrobial compounds produced by the other microorganisms associated with plant (Gilbert et al. 1993; Raaijmakers et al. 2009 ) and by predation by protozoa (Bonkowski 2004 ) and nematodes (Jousset et al. 2009 ). In total, the trophic stimulation of microbial growth by the plant is therefore selective. This usually results in a lower microbial diversity when comparing bulk soil with rhizosphere soil or the surface with the inside of the plant.

At the lowest taxonomic levels, especially the intraspecies level, horizontal gene transfer can influence microbial selection. Indeed, plants favor horizontal gene transfer events, including the exchange of conjugative plasmids between bacteria (Bjorklof et al. 2000) . Many abiotic and biotic factors modulate microbial selection by the plant, mainly through an effect on plant photosynthetic activity (and hence on exudation). This can be reflected by the occurrence of microbial successions in the rhizosphere, which can be related to host phenology (Garbeva et al. 2004; Mougel et al. 2006) .

Phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes are often facultative parasites called necrotrophic, whose saprophytic and parasitic phases alternate. They are responsible for penetrating injuries and necroses on a broad host range. Others are obligate parasites (biotrophic) developing only in living host plant. They require specialized bodies intrusion (appressorium* and haustorium*), their host range is narrow, and often they cause different types of symptoms. The majority of phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes affect the aerial parts of plants, causing diseases such as downy mildew (caused by oomycetes Phytophthora parasitica on tomato or Plasmopara viticola on vines), powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis on herbaceous or Uncinula necator on vines), corn smut (Ustilago maydis on corn), rust (Puccinia spp. on cereals and Uromyces spp. on Fabaceae), or rot (Botrytis cinerea on grapevine) (Agrios 1997; Heitman 2011) . In some cases, the disease symptoms are subtle, like ergot (Claviceps purpurea) or head blight of cereals (Fusarium spp.) because the phytoparasite produces mycotoxins such as (Berthiller et al. 2013) ]. These mycotoxigenic fungi are present all around the world and cause great losses to the world's agriculture. The disease caused by these molds reduces seed vigor, crop yield, and grain quality, making them poisonous to animals and humans. Mycotoxins are produced in the cereals, fruits, as well as in vegetables, in the field, and during transportation, storage, and processing. The problem of mycotoxins fluctuates from year to year, due to changes in the environmental conditions favorable for the production of mycotoxins and the development of the producing fungi. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the European Union have set limits for the most important mycotoxins in different crops, to avoid the adverse effects toward animals and humans. Soil-borne fungi and oomycetes that infect the seed or roots cause important diseases. Damping-off is generally caused by oomycetes such as Aphanomyces cochlioides on sugar beet and more particularly Pythium spp. on most crops, but fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani can also cause damage in vegetables or forest nurseries.

The contact of the plant with spores (constituting the primary inoculum) of fungal pathogens involves, as presented above, several environmental factors including wind, water, insects, and microfauna that vectorize the pathogens, but also the biochemical and mechanical infectious potential of these pathogens. Production of fungal mucilage consisting of polysaccharides and/ or glycoproteins ensures the adhesion of spores and germ tubes to the plant tissues. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the cuticle surface (U. necator on grapevine) or production of small proteins such as hydrophobins Mgp1 (Magnaporthe grisea on rice) enhances the adhesion of the propagules to the plant (Ebbole 2007) . In most cases, there is no specific site of infection on the surface of the plant. Fungi penetrate the aerial part of the plant by piercing the cuticle, growing through the anthesis, exploiting wounds (opportunistic fungi), or growing between the stomata guard cells. The fungal germ tube generally forms an appressorium that is simply a swelling of the tip of the hypha (B. cinerea) or results from cell differentiation (case of rusts) to puncture through plant cell wall using high physical pressure, cell wall degrading enzymes, or both. In the case of pathogenic bacteria too, penetration occurs most often through natural openings, such as nectaries of flowers (E. amylovora), stomata or hydathodes (X. campestris), or wounds (P. syringae). Their lytic enzymes play an important role in virulence (Kazemi-Pour et al. 2004 ). Quorum sensing is sometimes involved in the infectious process (Smadja et al. 2004 ). Different types of trophic relationships can then be established. Some fungi such as Venturia inaequalis, responsible for apple scab, establish under the leaf cuticle and use epidermal walls as trophic base thanks to pectinases they produce. Others, such as powdery mildews, exploit the cytoplasm of epidermal cells thanks to a sucker they develop from the surface of the leaf. In rust or mildew agents, colonization of a first cell is followed by the development of secondary hyphae that gradually colonize other cells. Similar strategies are observed among soil-borne fungi and oomycetes when penetrating the plant root and crown. For instance, no specific site of infection was found for F. oxysporum attacking tomato roots , and a set of extracellular enzymes is produced by the pathogens to degrade cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins of the plant epidermis and parenchyma leading to necroses, generalized rot, or tracheomycoses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 720, "end": 733, "text": "(Ebbole 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1562, "text": "(Kazemi-Pour et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1648, "text": "(Smadja et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection Processes"}, {"text": "As we saw previously, plants interact with many microorganisms, some of which being neutral or beneficial, while others are deleterious.

The plant, for instance, can respond to the presence of pathogens by the production of volatile compounds that will either promote or block microbial development, as for B. cinerea on strawberry (Abanda-Nkpwatt et al. 2006) .

These microbial elicitors called microbeassociated molecular patterns (MAMPs), also referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), are recognized at the surface of the host cell by receptor proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). MAMPs are basic components of all classes of pathogens. They may be constituents of the wall of the pathogen (exogenous elicitors) that are recognized by receptors. They may also correspond to the constituents of the plant cell wall that are released after degradation by microbial enzymes and recognized by receptors. A number of these common MAMPs and their role in the elicitation process have been recently described (Pel and Pieterse 2013) . Recognition by the plant of these nonself compounds is a first step toward an effective immune response.

The pathogens deliver effectors into the host cell by type III secretion (for bacteria) or using haustoria or other intracellular structures by an unknown mechanism (for fungi and oomycetes) (Dodds and Rathjen 2010) . These intracellular effectors often act to suppress PTI. However, many effectors are recognized by intracellular nucleotide-binding (NB)-LRR receptors; these sentry proteins are present at various levels in the plant (wall, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell membrane), and they allow a rapid response upon pathogen intrusion by inducing effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The gene-for-gene interaction takes place in that context (Table 11 .2). The pathogen avirulence genes encode the elicitor. Host plant resistance genes corresponding to avirulence gene in the pathogen encode plant receptors recognizing this elicitor. This recognition leads to cascades of defense reactions involving essential metabolic pathways such as the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways, as well as a massive influx of calcium ions into the cell together with potassium and chlorine efflux. Then, alarm signals are transmitted to the interior of the cell inducing the production of oxidizing radicals capable of inhibiting pathogen development. They lead to the activation of defense genes, synthesis of phytoalexins (plant antibiotics), and defense proteins called PR proteins (pathogenesis-related proteins), whose spectrum of activity is broad or narrow (van Loon et al. 2006) . Some correspond to chitinases (PR3) and glucanases (PR2), whereas others are poorly known (PR17). To reduce the spread of the pathogen, the plant cell wall thickens (Fig. 11 .7e) or, in the case of the hypersensitive response (HR), the infected cell transmits alarm signals to the neighboring cells that then destroy them (apoptosis*). It has to be noted that NB-LRR-mediated disease resistance is effective against pathogens that grow only (obligate biotrophs) or during part of the life cycle (hemibiotrophs) on living host tissue, but not against pathogens that kill host tissues during colonization (necrotrophs) (Jones and Dangl 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 340, "text": "(Dodds and Rathjen 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1598, "text": "(van Loon et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2240, "text": "(Jones and Dangl 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 764, "end": 773, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1774, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Interplay with Plant Defense Systems"}, {"text": "According to Dodds and Rathjen (2010) , ETI and PTI reveal different coevolution dynamics between the plant and the pathogen, as, in contrast to PAMPs, effectors are variable and unessential. Similarly, the diversity of ETI receptors and pathogen effectors both within and between species is frequent, whereas PRR functions are widely conserved across families. Usually, PTI and ETI provide similar responses, but ETI is qualitatively stronger and faster and often it is responsible for the hypersensitive response (HR). PTI is generally effective against nonspecific pathogens, whereas ETI is active against specific pathogens. However, these relationships are not exclusive and depend on the elicitor molecules present in each infection (Dodds and Rathjen 2010) . Jones and Dangl (2006) proposed a simple zigzag scheme including four steps to illustrate the functioning of the plant immune system: First, PRRs recognize PAMPs, which results in PTI and may stop further pathogenic invasion. Then, successful pathogens produce effectors that contribute to pathogen virulence. They negatively interfere with PTI. In a third step, a given effector is \"specifically recognized\" by one of the NB-LRR proteins, which leads to ETI. ETI is an accelerated and amplified PTI response, resulting in disease resistance and, usually, a hypersensitive cell death response at the infection site. At last, on one side, natural selection drives pathogens to avoid ETI by diversifying the recognized effector gene or by acquiring additional effectors that suppress ETI. On the other side, natural selection favors new plant NB-LRR alleles that can recognize one of the newly acquired effectors, resulting again in ETI. Therefore, the interplay between microbial pathogens and plants presents several similarities with the case of animal diseases (cf.

Interference with plant hormonal metabolism may also be involved, via bacterial production of phytohormones (auxins and cytokinins) and/ or bacterial deamination of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), the ethylene precursor in the plant (Dobbelaere et al. 2003) . The auxin indole-3-acetic produced by PGPR helps getting around plant defense mechanisms, thereby facilitating PGPR colonization of the plant (Remans et al. 2006 ). Finally, phytobeneficial effects also include triggering of systemic resistance in the plant, in particular, induced systemic resistance (ISR) pathways relying on jasmonate and ethylene (van Loon et al. 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 412, "end": 435, "text": "(Dobbelaere et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 590, "end": 613, "text": "(Dobbelaere et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 716, "end": 737, "text": "(Amellal et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 763, "end": 783, "text": "(Groppa et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1052, "text": "(Dobbelaere et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1216, "text": "(Remans et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1428, "text": "(van Loon et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 205, "text": "(Fig. 11.11a", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Cooperation"}, {"text": "Indirect phytobeneficial effects of PGPR entail inhibition of parasitic bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes, and even parasitic plants (e.g., Striga), mainly through competition or antagonism (Chapon et al. 2002; Raaijmakers et al. 2009 ). Competition can take place for macronutrients (such as organic carbon), micronutrients (such as soluble ferric iron via high-affinity siderophores), and/or infection sites. Antagonism (syn. amensalism) may involve extracellular lytic enzymes (e.g., cellulases, chitinases, proteases), which act on the cell wall of pathogenic microorganisms, their virulence factors (such as fusaric acid from Fusarium oxysporum, degraded by some Burkholderia), or their intercellular signals (such as N-acyl homoserine lactone in Pectobacterium carotovorum) (Raaijmakers et al. 2009 ).

Phytobeneficial microorganisms promote plant development primarily by altering plant hormonal balance, while their impact on plant growth may also involve trophic microbial effects. For example, the potential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation is typically in the order of 60-200 kg N/ha/year, for which the plant will invest 3-25 % of net photosynthates, versus only 5-25 kg N/ha/year for free nitrogen fixation. Nevertheless, the symbiotic nitrogen fixation potential is often poorly exploited in modern agriculture, which relies on massive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Mycorrhization improves plant nutrition in phosphorus and nitrogen, and to a lesser extent in potassium and iron, especially in low-fertility soils (Brundrett 2009 ). Phosphorus can be recovered by mycorrhizal hyphae at more than 7 cm from the root.

Pioneer plant species will modify soil microbial community composition/functioning which, in turn, may then influence plant succession and the composition of intermediate groups, both by favoring certain plant species and counterselecting others.

Biofertilizers aim at improving plant mineral nutrition, e. g., symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium and other genera) and to a lesser extent mycorrhizal fungi. For PGPR having mainly hormonal effects on the plant, the term phytostimulation is used instead of biofertilization. The main phytostimulators used belong to the genus Azospirillum, especially for cereals (0.5-1 million ha of corn inoculated each year). Azospirillum inoculation resulted in increased cereal yield (by 10-30 %) in two-thirds of the cases (Dobbelaere et al. 2001 ). Biological control is most often implemented in commercial greenhouse, using bacteria or fungal inoculants. The objective is to protect crops against phytopathogens (often fungi or oomycetes, sometimes bacteria), parasitic nematodes or plants, or weeds.

Such cohabitation usually leads to more or less intimate associations between microorganisms and animals. Spatial proximity, contact time, and the degree of dependence between the interacting partners influence the type and evolution of these associations. Microorganisms use animals as habitats in which they live and from which they retrieved nutrients necessary for their multiplication. They colonize the outlying areas, such as the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, and can penetrate the tissues and organs of host animals. Some microorganisms can colonize the cytoplasm of germ cells, oocytes, and sperm and are thus subject to possible vertical transmission (from parents to offsprings), which can allow a greater ability to spread among host population. The presence and activities of microorganisms will affect development, reproduction, and survival of host animals. The nature of the effects caused by microorganisms and the animal responses to these infections are very diverse and are part of a continuum from parasitism to mutualism (Buchner 1965) . Whatever the outcome of the interaction (neutral, beneficial, or deleterious), animals respond to infection by implementing defense systems, either by inducing immune responses or setting up physical barriers to prevent or limit the spread of microorganisms considered as potentially infectious agents. In parallel, microorganisms develop strategies to circumvent the defenses of animals by manipulation host traits or molecular mimicry. It is the tradeoff between cost and benefits, that is to say, the balance of the association in terms of adaptive value, which defines the type of interaction (Moran 2007) .

The T4SS, meanwhile, allows the translocation of nucleoprotein complexes to hosts, either directly inside the target cell or via the extracellular medium (Llosa and O'Callaghan 2004) . Mammal cells such as human cells but also plant cells are potential targets, providing an agronomic and medical interest to the study of these systems. Pili formed by the T3SS and T4SS are also involved in the attachment process of bacteria to target cells.

Buchnera genomes contain multiple copies of genes that encode the biosynthesis of essential amino acids such as tryptophan and appropriate gene regulators (Shigenobu et al. 2000) . The intracellular localization of the bacteria facilitates the transfer of microbial compounds produced to the host. In return, the host provides the bacteria with energy for growth in an environment free of competitors. Like most obligate intracellular symbionts, unable to grow outside the host cell, the genome of Buchnera has undergone a significant size reduction by eliminating a large number of genes (for membranes, metabolism, etc.), whose functions are performed by the aphid. It is possible to identify genes lost in Buchnera by comparative analysis with the genome of its closest relative, the bacterial saprophyte E. coli (Moran and Mira 2001) . From an evolutionary point of view, the mutual dependence between aphids and Buchnera dates back nearly 200 million years and the congruence of phylogenies of the partners reflects a coevolutionary process supported by vertical transmission of Buchnera across generations of aphids (van Ham et al. 2003) . In addition to Buchnera, aphids are hosts of many bacteria termed secondary symbionts. The role of these clandestine passengers is now better understood.

Active anaerobic intestinal bacteria in the gut, anoxic, are similar between humans and animals. Recent work confirms the existence of mutualistic bacteria in the human gut. Indeed, the genomes of the obligate anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides, the dominant human gut bacterial genus, confirm the presence of genetic determinants and proteins involved in the degradation of polysaccharide compounds (Xu et al. 2003 ).

Four effects of reproductive manipulation are known: feminization of genetic males, male-killing by larval development arrest, parthenogenesis in haplodiploid Hymenoptera, and cytoplasmic incompatibility, which is a non-fertile cross between infected males with Wolbachia and uninfected female or carrying a different strain of Wolbachia (Werren et al. 1999) . Wolbachia is thus qualified as a parasite of the reproduction of its host. These reproductive manipulations have resulted in biased sex ratios disadvantaging males, thus generating more females that transmit Wolbachia transovarially to their descendants. This explains the high prevalence of Wolbachia in natural populations of arthropods, estimated at up to 76 % in insects (Jeyaprakash and Hoy 2000; Hilgenboecker et al. 2008) .

Microbes can also induce apoptosis in immune cells to destroy these cells thereby facilitating their escape. The ability to circumvent host defenses by modulating apoptosis is found in various microbial taxa, Fig. 11.19 Comparison of apoptotic pathways between drosophila and mammals. In D. melanogaster, dArk adapter (protein homologous to Apaf-1 in mammals) activates the initiator caspase Dronc. Proteins having pro-and antiapoptotic domains Debcl and Buffy, belonging to the Bcl-2 family, may regulate the activation through dArk, but this step has not been demonstrated. The apoptosis inhibitor protein, DIAP-1, negatively regulates activity of Dronc and of the caspase effector Drice. The RGH family proteins (such as Rpr, Hid and Grim) activate apoptosis by inhibiting the action of DIAP-1 on caspases. In mammals, the intrinsic pathway is characterized by the activation of caspase 9 (functional homologue of Dronc) by Apaf-1. But the activity of Apaf-1 depends on the Bcl-2 family proteins: Bax and Bak have a proapoptotic activity, while Bcl-2 inhibits this activity to prevent apoptosis. Intracellular death signals activate BH3 domain proteins, thereby promoting activity of Bax and Bak. The latter form pores in the mitochondrial membrane resulting in the release of proteins that either promote the activation of the Smac/Diablo complex, preventing the action of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), or activate Apaf-1 (role of cytochrome C). In the extrinsic pathway, the cell death receptor is activated by its specific ligand which causes the recruitment of the FADD adapter. FADD can then activate caspase 8, an initiator caspase. Finally, the two routes meet in the activation of effector caspases (such as caspases 3 and 7, Drice homologues) that lead to cell death (Adapted from Hay and Guo 2006) especially in intracellular microbes (Roulston et al. 1999; Gao and Abu Kwaid 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 365, "end": 375, "text": "Fig. 11.19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1980, "text": "Hay and Guo 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2040, "text": "(Roulston et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF220"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2064, "text": "Gao and Abu Kwaid 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modulation of Apoptosis"}, {"text": "Commensal and pathogenic bacteria can inactivate apoptosis by modulating the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (Fig. 11.20) .
