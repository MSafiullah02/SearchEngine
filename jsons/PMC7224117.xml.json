            "text": "Major perioperative cardiovascular events, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, and pericardial tamponade, are important causes of morbidity in patients undergoing repair of congenital heart disease (CHD) [1]. A number of clinical risk indices have been developed, but their predictive power is limited [2], raising the need for a simple and strongly predictive noninvasive alternative. MiRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that was shown to be useful biomarkers in various diseases. The posttranslational regulatory roles of miRNAs have been demonstrated in almost all physiological processes. Unlike other extracellular RNA molecules, extracellular miRNAs are remarkably stable in serum and, together with their tissue specificity and the ease by which they can be detected and quantified, they have sparked great interest in their use as clinical biomarkers for a wide range of medical states [3]. We had reported that the level of circulating cardiac miRNA-208a following surgery can serve as a sensitive biomarker for the postoperative course of pediatric patients with CHD undergoing heart surgery for the repair of their defect [4]. In the present study, we hypothesized that preoperative miRNA-208a levels in the blood of pediatric patients with CHD can predict postoperative complications.",

The inclusion criteria were age younger than 21 years and an echocardiographic diagnosis of CHD that required cardiac surgery. The laboratory parameters assessed in the study were as follows: troponin at 24 h after surgery, lactate at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and maximal lactate after surgery, and maximal creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels measured during the hospitalization period. The preoperatively measured parameters were Aristotle score [5], invasive or noninvasive ventilator support, oxygen saturation levels, and whether the surgery was elective or nonelective. The surgical parameters were the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and aortic crossclamp (ACC) times. The postoperative parameters were invasive and noninvasive ventilator support, length of ventilation, length of hospitalization (LOH), need for reintubation, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), maximal inotropic support, and number of days during which inotropic support was given. These parameters were divided into two groups in order to examine correlations. The first group contained the parameters that were related to the LOH (i.e., invasive and noninvasive ventilation days and the total number of hospitalization days), and they did not account for children who died following surgery. The second group contained all the other parameters and accounted for all the children in the study.",

MiRNA quantification was performed on a StepOne\u2122 PCR (QPCR). Reactions (10 \u03bcl total) were run in triplicates and consisted of: 5 \u03bcl PCR-mix (ABI, #AB-4444557), 0.5 \u03bcl of either of the Taqman miRNA assays (ABI, #AB-4427975): cel-miRNA39 (#000200) or miRNA-208a (#000511), and 1.5 \u03bcl of the cDNA and 3 \u03bcl H2O. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated with the StepOne software v2.3. \u2206Ct values are calculated by subtracting the Ct of miRNA-208a from the Ct of cel-miRNA39 of the same sample.

Accurate preoperative risk assessment at an individual patient level enhances clinical decision-making of postoperative patient management and the estimation of associated risks. To date, preoperative prediction of the postoperative course involves the use of the Aristotle score which takes into account the complexity of the surgical procedure and predicts 30-day mortality and LOH during the first postoperative week. In addition, recent papers have shown the potential benefit of preoperative ST2 levels to identify children with increased risk of mortality or readmission after pediatric heart surgery [6, 7]. We were intrigued by the possibility that miRNA-208a could also serve as a preoperative biomarker for the child\u2019s potential sequelae. Our results indeed showed that high expression levels of preoperative circulating miRNA-208a were predictive of a better postoperative outcome, as reflected by fewer complications following surgery and, accordingly, were correlated with a low Aristotle score and a shorter LOH.",

The hearts of those patients were \u201cprepared\u201d before surgery by a yet to be determined mechanism, which enabled them to cope optimally with the stress caused during and immediately after the operation, with the result of fewer postoperative complications. Our study is not the first to suggest that a beneficial postoperative outcome is seen in patients whose hearts were exposed to preoperative stress. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) was found to be clinically effective in a study by Wu et al. on TOF children undergoing open heart surgery [8]. Those authors showed that RIPC attenuated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and improved the short-term prognosis of those patients [8]. Not surprisingly, miRNAs have been reported to mediate such protection of the heart in several studies [9, 10]. The involvement of miRNAs in protective mechanisms has also been described in preconditioning of the brain [11].",

            "text": "The source of the high levels of circulating miRNA-208a before surgery has yet to be determined. In general, extracellular circulating miRNAs originate from two main sources: they can be merely byproducts of cellular activity and cell death [12], or they can be the result of a selective export system which enables the secreted miRNA to be transferred to a recipient cell where it can carry out its role [13]. We and others have shown that the presence of miRNA-208a in the blood correlates with damage caused to the heart [4, 14, 15]; however, there are no studies that define the exact mechanism of the export system. Notably, however, circulating miRNA-208a in the blood could be a trigger for inducing a heart-protective mechanism whose results become evident following surgery in both of the above-mentioned scenarios. A role for miRNA-208a in communicating signals from the heart to other parts of the body has been reported by Feng et al., who found that cardiac miRNA-208a released into the circulation following myocardial I/R is capable of activating innate immunity [16]. We suggest that because the hearts of the children that were subjected to prolonged physiological stress until the date of the operation had the opportunity to be more prepared, and possibly more protected, from the effects of the operation, those children sustained fewer postoperative complications. Although the correlation between the levels of miRNA-208a and the postoperative course was more significant in the cyanotic patients, results pointing in the same direction were also obtained for the non-cyanotic ones. This observation strengthens our position that exposing the heart to abnormal physiological constraints, as could be expected in children with low oxygen saturation, produces a stronger \u201csignal\u201d to provoke a protective mechanism, whatever it may be.",
