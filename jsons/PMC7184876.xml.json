            "text": "As a former K-12 teacher, whenever I hear the word assessment, I still cringe a little. I taught from 2004 to 2015. My entire teaching career was essentially contemporaneous with No Child Left Behind and the obsession over standardized testing and data. And while it makes me cringe, I know that assessment and evaluation is or should be at the heart of what any great teacher does. Mathison (2014, 247) similarly noted that assessment is usually seen as an externally mandated phenomenon which is \u201cdefined by others.\u201d Mathison (2014, 247) urges teachers to resist these external calls and definitions of assessment and practice assessment that \u201csupports a democratic vision of public schooling.\u201d A note on terminology is in order. The terms assessment and evaluation overlap, but there are some distinctions (Rea, 2020). Assessment refers to the methods of gathering data on student performance and using this data to make decisions regarding learning, while evaluation refers to the judgements about students and teachers made based on those assessments (Banks, McGee-Banks, & Clegg, 1999; Chapin, 2015; Rea, 2020). Both are important for our purposes. Teachers and professors must use the information gained from the assignments in this book (e.g. ideas from class discussions and student created comics) to continually improve the assignments, adjust them to the unique conditions of individual classrooms, to evaluate the effectiveness of the assignments and teacher practice, and ultimately, help students arrive at their own ideas of citizenship in the hyperreal.",

            "text": "In order to accomplish these tasks, teachers need to know if what they are doing is indeed helping students think. A standardized test created by a corporation I think is very limited in this respect. Perhaps this is the crotchety teacher coming out in me, but to truly assess and evaluate student thinking, we need to go much deeper. It simply requires more. Below, I examine a number of ways that graphic novels, both the reading and creating of them, might be assessed and evaluated. There are not specific rubrics for every exercise, although I do have rubric for the culminating symbolism assignment (the mini-comics assignment) which was presented in Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_5. I think rubrics for every assignment would defeat the purpose and crush any variability and spontaneity. Following Kincheloe (2001), I am wary of anything standardized for classrooms and teachers because this standardization neglects the fact that each classroom is different. I do not want to crush teacher creativity (Kincheloe, 2001). Instead, what I offer below are more general guidelines for teachers to make evaluations about student work. These guidelines however do not just serve as assessment guidelines, but also as a way for students to see what is expected of them (for my culminating symbolism project, I showed students the rubric beforehand so they knew what I was looking for in the project).",

            "text": "Two other important notions related to assessment are formative assessment and the use of different assessment tasks. Chapin (2015) examines the importance of formative assessment, which is assessment that is ongoing during teaching. Specifically, informal formative assessment, known as \u201con-the-fly\u201d assessment is crucial (Chapin, 2015, 159). Regarding formative assessment Mathison (2014, 256) asserts that assessment can be fused with instruction, which can yield a \u201ccontinuous flow of information about what students do and do not yet know.\u201d Informal formative assessment includes looking at students work as they complete it to see what they know, teacher questioning of students and observations of student discussions (Chapin, 2015; Larson, 2017; Mathison, 2014). I utilized these types of formative assessments for the comic assignments. As students were completing the assignments and frameworks, and even as I was explaining and assigning them, I constantly checked for understanding. I talked to students to ensure they understood what was to be done. After we discussed completed assignments, I used the discussions as a type of assessment. One thing I learned about implementing the reading assignments was that I needed to make sure students were paying attention not only to the content, but the comics form. Indeed, it is the comics form which differentiates this whole enterprise from just reading regular prose novels.",

            "text": "The process of action research is also useful here as well. Mertler (2020) argues that action research is performed by teachers and for teachers to understand their own specific classrooms and schools. For action research studies, teachers generally first identify a topic that they want to examine and then consult scholarly literature (Larson, 2017; Mertler, 2020). Next teachers decide on their research methods, implement the intervention and collect data on it and analyze the data (Mertler, 2020). Finally, an action plan for the future is developed, the results are shared and the teacher reflects on the process (Mertler, 2020). Of course action research is not this linear, but this gives some inkling of the process (Mertler, 2020). Action research is cyclical, meaning that an intervention can be performed by the teacher, who then reflects on it, and can then keep implementing the same intervention while incorporating the lessons learned from the last iteration (Mertler, 2020). An important consideration of action research is the uniqueness of individual classroom settings (Larson, 2017; Mertler, 2020).",

I consulted the literature (see Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_1 and relevant parts of the other chapters), implemented the activities in my classes, gathered information and feedback, and am using the feedback to guide future implementation. I am also sharing the results (this book, as well as at professional conferences). The data analysis utilizes the formative assessment procedures and rubrics (I will get to these shortly). In line with action research, I view these endeavors as incomplete and cyclical. While it was not feasible for me to implement every assignment in this book, I learned from the assignments that I did implement. I would recommend that teachers implementing the comic assignments utilize similar procedures and consult the literature on action research for more clarification (Larson, 2017).

Students, many times asked questions which I did not anticipate and which forced me to reconsider aspects of assignments. For instance, in my History 402 class, we examined an excerpt from the graphic novel Uncle Sam. I used this excerpt to introduce the ideas of symbolism and imagery and part of our political discourse. We had a great discussion in class. Afterwards, my students noted how they would have liked a primer on how to read comics. This information was extremely useful as I moved forward and introduced more comics related material.",

Many of these assignments are asking students to take on creative, open ended tasks which may create ambiguity. I view all of this from an assessment perspective. My own experiences in implementing comics related pedagogy have been invaluable and constantly inform future practice. Every comment and criticism (either formally on class evaluations or informal comments) a student gives to me helps me to refine these assignments for the next go around. Obviously no two classes are the same, but formal and informal student feedback has helped me to continue to fine tune these assignments. Paying attention to student comments is good practice (Carter, 2013). This is probably good advice for any teacher and all assignments, but I think it especially pertinent with these types of assignments.",

I include this as a form of assessment because it helped me see new applications for some of the material in this book. She told me that she began to use comics to teach aspects of the social studies, specifically economics. She began using Calvin and Hobbes comics to teach concepts of opportunity costs and supply and demand. These are admittedly somewhat boring concepts, especially to fourth graders, but she found a way to use comics to convey these dry social studies concepts in a lively way. I believe her words are worth quoting at length. She wrote in an email to me:We were discussing supply and demand, specialization, competition, and opportunity cost after introducing the Industrial Revolution and Maryland\u2019s economy. The comic strip discusses how without competition, prices increase and quality of product may decrease. Calvin demonstrates opportunity cost with how he is skimping on environmental and safety issues in order to keep prices lower, despite it not being satisfactory to the buyer. For supply and demand, this illustrates perfectly the consumer is the demand and supplier is whomever fills the need. Specialization was a bit trickier, but after discussing Maryland\u2019s economy and using the abundance of certain natural resources to specialize and build industries, the students actually connected that Calvin is using what resources he has to make a product. Even if that product is just a lemon thrown in water. While it\u2019s not a perfect representation, it gives a picture of how economics is a relationship between the buyer and seller. I had two students act out the cartoon, and we labeled the parts as a class. We then labeled the labels with examples from Maryland. The students seemed to enjoy. (E. Gore, email communication, May 29, 2019)\n",

Does it \u201chang together?\u201d do the elements \u201cwork together?\u201d), generativity (the way a piece allows the viewer to see phenomena differently), social significance (the work has a \u201cfocus on the issues that a make a sizeable difference in the lives of people within a society\u201d) and evocation/illumination (\u201cone begins to feel the meanings that the work is to help its readers grasp\u201d) (2012, 148\u2013154). Regarding citizenship, student\u2019s creations should be concise and incisive. They should help other citizens, especially those of a different political persuasion, to think differently about a topic. The piece should also make sense to readers so they can get something out of it. Of course, there can and usually should be multiple meanings of a piece of art (Duncombe & Lambert, 2018).

I have adapted and modified this rubric (the rubric was presented in Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_5). I have also combined it with aspects from Epstein (1997). The criteria for my rubric are: narrative/historical understanding, use of comics medium, interanimation of words and pictures, and the images themselves. These criteria embody not only literary and artistic qualities, but literary and artistic concerns in conjunction with historical and citizenship notions. I stress to my students that I am not concerned with how well they draw, but rather, how they use art and words to convey meanings of citizenship. If given the rubric beforehand, it may foster creativity and conversations about that creative process and product, somewhat like distributing a playbill prior to a play (Barone & Eisner, 2012). I do not see the rubric as an immutable standard that students must attain. This rubric, along with criteria from Epstein and Barone and Eisner, can help teachers evaluate student created art work. Further, Barone and Eisner\u2019s (2012), Epstein (1997), and Novak\u2019s ideas are related in many ways to the concern of the first chapter and citizenship in hyperreality. They all call attention to the actual construction of the comic, to historical plausibility, to its significance and ability to generate empathy. Following Epstein (1997), we want to indulge students\u2019 imaginations, but not allow for an anything goes approach. There needs to be some grounding in reality, students cannot simply abdicate into fantasy. At the same time, there must be ample room for creativity and divergent thinking. All student creations are \u201cevidence.\u201d Each student assignment gives me a window into a student\u2019s thought process regarding citizenship.",

Many times I only require small comics as part of a classroom activity. For the larger assignment like the culminating symbolism activity in Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_5, a more formal rubric or something similar might be necessary. Nevertheless, even with the more informal assignments, the points above can still help teachers and professors judge student work. Teachers can ask of student work: Is the work illuminating different aspects of an issue? Does the student work help to convey political and historical messages or messages regarding citizenship theories? Is the work concise and use minimal verbiage? These loose questions can give teachers and professors some idea as to the worth of the assignments, as well as ways to improve for the next iteration. Teachers can look for historical accuracy (when applicable), historical possibility, and empathy (Epstein, 1997) as well as incisiveness and social significance (Barone & Eisner, 2012) in the more informal student comics done as classwork assignments. The guiding questions can get students and teachers thinking explicitly about how the work relates to some of the citizenship ideas in the hyperreal.",

The assignment from Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_4, where students had to draw their own Version of Reality (VOR) is shown in Fig. 6.1. The student who drew this cartoon is an art teacher, so it looks better than most. This assignment had students construct their VOR or version of reality (Shealy, 2014). The assignment called for an exploration of how beliefs and experiences cause actions. Since this piece is not as historical, I utilized Barone and Eisner\u2019s (2012) criteria. The student who drew this is a lesbian who grew up in a very conservative area of the south. She then moved to the Baltimore area as a young adult. The first thing that struck me was the incisiveness and social significance of this piece. This piece touches on LGBTQ issues which is obviously a pertinent question in contemporary American society. Further, the piece is concise. She uses minimal verbiage to get her point across. There are some speech bubbles but the words are minimal. However, the words are important to the piece, they help to convey her rejection by society and the piece might not be as powerful without those words. The piece is also coherent, it is put together well and makes sense.\n",

In the first panel she is rejected by society that scorns her, but in the second panel we realize that she doesn\u2019t really care. I have known some from the LGBTQ community (as well as other marginalized and non-dominant communities) who experienced a similar type of rejection. Yet the piece is actually happy. She is rejected but overcomes this and starts a new life in a more welcoming community\u2014Baltimore. I can see the rejection and happy ending in this piece and I think it is as or more effective than reading about it. It is here where I also began to \u201cfeel\u201d the meaning and power of the piece, which is what Barone and Eisner (2012, 153) call evocation and illumination. This assignment let me truly see and feel Jennifer\u2019s VOR. As a heterosexual white male, I may not be able to truly understand what she went through, but at least I can begin to contemplate it. And this contemplation of another human being, another citizen, is an important part of citizenship. I saw how her VOR shaped who she is and led her to act the way she did. She encoded elements of her VOR into a comic to challenge injustice and invite readers to consider this sensitive topic from a new and more empathetic angle.",

We had spent a good deal of deal of time talking about first amendment rights in the classroom which is reflected in the comic. The comic is concise. It does not employ excess verbiage or details. The words are sparse but necessary. Some of the verbiage is posted, such as the title of the school and the establishment date on the post (the date is 1791, the date the bill of rights were ratified). Much of the factual information is conveyed pictorially, such as the gate itself, which is a reference to the famous quote \u201cIt can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate\u201d in landmark Tinker v. DesMoines case. The second frame has the children from Tinker, who are admitted to the school because their armbands were found to be free speech, while students in later cases were denied. All of these are accurate historical details which are woven into this fictional piece. Here Epstein\u2019s (1997) ideas of historical accuracy and plausibility come to mind, as well as the idea that arts based research can be empirical (Barone & Eisner, 2012). The story and activity in the comic are simple and repetitious. There is a school which are some are admitted to and some are not. It is simple and to the point, which relates back to incisiveness. The social significance of this piece was blatantly obvious to me. The question of free speech is ongoing and complex in hyperreality. What constitutes free speech\u2014and what are the parameters in a school setting? The comic forces the reader, by use of skillful encapsulation and historical detail in sequence, to confront this question in a unique manner.\n",

As noted in the last chapter, one theme that we discussed at length in my history class was the notion of education as an institution of liberation or social control and my student drew a comic examining these ideas.

So, she exhibited historical knowledge. However, in some cases, she had to make decisions about how people felt and expressed themselves in these different circumstances. She could infer this knowledge from our readings and discussion, but ultimately had to depict it the way she saw fit. She expertly used the comics medium, as well as emotions on the figures she drew to convey her messages. The scenes of social control were left in pencil, while the scenes of liberation were in vibrant color. The scenes of social control were drawn with more constricting panel sizes. In addition, on pages depicting no social control, there were no panels at all. This I thought was an excellent use of the comics medium itself, specifically the use of encapsulation and the page as a unit, to convey messages about historical materials and ideas related to citizenship. While she could have written about social control in a traditional way, I think she captured the essence of social control visually and it resonates deeper with the reader. Social control and liberation are two narratives of education and she was able to grapple and present both of them in her comic- and many times we as citizens are forced to deal with simultaneous and competing narratives, especially as they proliferate on social media. In addition, the symbols and imagery she employed were powerful; pencils, priests, schools, American flags as well as people and situations that she created for the comic. She spoke to the reader with symbols, which is an important skill in hyperreality.",

As stated earlier, I do not claim that these assignments will make students better citizens, but the assignments can at least start a conversation as to what this citizenship might look like. Below, I have also provided some questions for teachers and students to consider. These questions are a shorthand for all of the complex ideas sketched out in Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_1 and ask how the use of the comics form helps to portray these notions of citizenship. These guiding questions, in conjunction with the ideas of Epstein (1997), Barone and Eisner (2012) and Novak (2014), are an attempt to link the assignments in this book, and the products that result, to citizenship in the hyperreal. Moreover, I think this relationship must always be flexible and tenuous. Citizenship cannot be nailed down into a quantitative score. Rather, I think citizenship must be viewed through the things we as citizens create, through our conversations, through actions and relationships to other citizens. Professors and students themselves should answer the questions below by giving examples from student work and using these examples to facilitate conversations. Hopefully, the rubrics and guiding questions can begin to illuminate these elements. But the result of the rubric and answers to the questions below are not final, rather they are just another intermediate step in the ongoing process of maintaining a healthy republic.",

My student\u2019s use of symbolism and imagery is intriguing. She incorporated buses, maps, contemporary signs (e.g. MAGA hats) to convey her ideas. She used strong symbols and imagery, such as by depicting desegregation with the use of black and white dots as well as the use of a maze. In her own words, she wrote: \u201cI chose to use a maze to show the systemic barriers that prevent black individuals from succeeding in the same way that white individuals do easily.\u201d I think her use of a maze could also be related to dispositions\u2014she is depicting dispositions of social justice and equality visually (an inequality). Moreover, there is an obvious commentary on power relations throughout the whole work which can make the work a statement on justice oriented citizenship.

Comics become a class discussion, a group thing which helps to change thinking and values (Duncombe & Lambert, 2018). I believe the act of teaching progressive citizenship is inherently activist anyway. Students are (hopefully) changed because they are taught to think differently and the hope is that they then will take these new understandings and then participate in the republic. In this case, students are taught to think differently with comics pedagogy. Further, if the comics activities in this book are done with current or prospective teachers as I am advocating, those individuals can then take the comics pedagogy and adapt it for their classes, infusing countless students who are citizens in the making in hyperreality. This is happening to me, a number of my students have taken these ideas and adapted them for use in their own class, as I noted earlier.",

The audience includes (but is not limited to; 6\u201312 social studies teachers, social studies methods professors, professors of history and other professors interested in promoting citizenship). With that said, what is suitable in a college classroom may be wildly inappropriate for a 7th grade classroom. So, for one, there has to be great discretion and professional judgment when employing comics in the classroom at the middle and high school level. There may also be curricular concerns at the middle or high school level because these teachers, especially in core subjects like history, are generally more restricted by standardized tests and state curriculums. It may be a hard to sell to bring a Batman comic into a class which does not have time to spare and where the teacher is racing through content to teach what is on the end of year test. Nevertheless, I think comics can still be utilized in the 6\u201312 classroom in a variety of ways.",

For one, even traditional superhero comics may at times, even tangentially, center on real world events and social issues, or the subject matter itself may be of social concern. Further, comics can be understood in historical terms (Ricca, 2012; Wright, 2003). Social studies teachers can look carefully at comics and find links to their curriculum or the NCSS themes and use those links to justify the inclusion of those comics. Mathison (2014, 262) does note that while linking assignments to standards is good practice, this should not be an \u201cexercise in compliance.\u201d Rather, teachers must constantly work though and figure out how their assignments link to the standards but how this action is situated in the wider purposes and goals that the standards promote (Mathison, 2014). Teachers can make these links explicit to their students or help guide student\u2019s to find those links as part of the overall analysis of the comics. Further, teachers can constantly link the comic\u2019s assignment to larger social studies goals and to student\u2019s decision making in the republic by asking such questions as outlined in the last section.",

Another consideration may be the actual method used to analyze the comic itself. For example, suppose a teacher has to teach about Buddhism. If for a supplemental activity, the teacher was to utilize or modify a Buddhist framework offered in this book, and has students apply this to a comic or graphic novel with no link to the curriculum (e.g. a Batman comic), this could still be justified because the method itself centers on Buddhism.

I would assume that other teachers may have similar experiences. I taught two electives, Introduction to Philosophy and African American studies. In these classes, there were no required state tests and there was little oversight of the curriculum. I had almost free reign to do what I wanted. Again, I cannot speak to how other schools structure or oversee their electives, but at least for me, I had a great deal of freedom. If teachers teach electives and have freedom like I did, the use of comics to promote citizenship can be very beneficial.

Obviously this is an issue that cannot be overlooked, especially in middle and elementary schools. While I would not advise using explicit materials in an elementary or middle school, there may be some leeway in high schools. For instance, when I taught African American History, I had to send home permission slips when I showed certain movies, such as Malcom X. While the permission slip was a practical measure, it could also, as one of the reviewers of this work pointed out, allow for a degree of student choice. Of course, depending on the school and the district, it may just be prudent to steer clear of all questionable material or at least check with an administrator.",

In this section, I offer some description and analysis. Entertaining Comics ( EC Comics) aroused much controversy in the 1950s (Wright, 2003). And while many of those comics were gory and outlandish, Wright (2003) points out that many contained amazingly prescient social and political barbs aimed at American society (Wright, 2003). This fact makes them excellent objects of study for this book. Many of the EC comics have been reprinted. I have some paperback issues, but there are also hard cover anthologies. One story from Weird Science-Fantasy, No. 6, February called The Inferiors is a tale that I read as a kid and to this day haunts me. A group of astronauts are on a mission to answers questions about a lost but highly advanced alien civilization. What we come to find out is that the civilization voluntarily killed itself because it had grown decadent and immoral. Yet a small band of the aliens did not want to die, they wanted to live with their imperfections, and so their memories were wiped and they were jettisoned off the planet to start a new civilization\u2014earth. We descended from the immoral and decadent rejects. It is explained that man is the ultimate de-evolution of this once great race. It is a harrowing tale which can be used to call into question humanities grandeur, sense of purpose and self-worth. Further, while the question of species suicide may be delicate at the high school level, it is a fascinating concept which can spark questions of societal peaks and declines, and the ultimate question of when and if a society is too immoral or decadent to continue.",

            "text": "Another EC story, this time from Shock Suspense stories, No. 13, September, titled Blood Brothers, can bring up questions of racism. A man named Sid finds out his best friend is actually part African-American. Sid torments his friend and eventually burns a cross on his lawn, driving the friend to suicide. Sid is obsessed with the idea of Negro Blood contamination. The town doctor explains to Sid that the idea of Negro blood is nonsense and that when Sid was a child, the doctor had to perform an emergency blood transfusion from a Black farmhand. The story ends with Sid in disbelief that he has had Negro blood in him all along and that he drove his friend to suicide. For me, this story always called into mind irrational racist and ethnic hatreds juxtaposed with the ultimate similarity between white and black bodies. It is a harrowing tale that is just as prescient now as it was then.",

In this story, there is a tyrannically interplanetary alliance and two rebel groups opposing them. One rebel group is willing to use any means necessary, even killing innocent people, to topple the alliance (and the leader speaks these words with a maniacal face). The other rebel group, led by the pilot Mal, want to topple the alliance but question and disagree with the other group\u2019s course of action. For me, this story always called into question the price one has to pay to achieve drastic political change (something directly referenced in the book as well). The comic makes people question the uses of violence to achieve political ends and for me, brings to mind historical figures who did advocate for violence to achieve change. Further, this violence was not only directed at the opposition, but innocents as well, who became collateral. Again, some of these topics might be sensitive with high schoolers, but political violence has been part of history and it needs to be discussed.",

Then only the valiant, the venal and the insane remained in the place they called No Man\u2019s Land.\u201d Batman: Shadow of the Bat, no. 86 from June 1999 opens with a description of gang wars. In Batman: Detective Comics, no. 733 from June 1999 has Batman, like Solomon, decide who a baby belongs too. The point is that law and order are gone, and this situation, new types of citizenship ideas may be needed. It can lead to an interesting discussion of how people should (or might) act in this situation. I also think of the Walking Dead series which explores these notions as well. In the absence of government, how will people act? How should they act? What would citizenship look like with no government? These questions can be excellent springboards to deep discussion.",

In one instance, television executives are not compelled to give up Joker\u2019s location because due to constitutional concerns. Joker is giving them a story for a television show. This is over Gordon\u2019s objection that the Joker is a public menace. A few panels later Batman, with his mask off, watching the show with Alfred laments: \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening\u2026not in a civilized country.\u201d To which Alfred retorts: \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is sir\u2026\u201d Of course Joker dupes everyone and terrorizes the cast because of this decision. But I think the comic can raise interesting points. If the Joker or someone like him was real, what protections would he be given? How would the law deal with this? How do you balance freedoms with security? Again, the fictional comic, while dramatic and over the top, can raise these types of questions to ponder.",

In one scene, Scarlett brutally murders a dirty cop. She reflects on this act and notes: \u201cIt is my opinion that he gave up his rights as a human being by betraying society\u2026\u201d These types of statements can serve as fodder for class discussion on rights, citizenship and accountability. This graphic novel however is extremely explicit with regards to sex and violence, and probably cannot be used in a high school classroom. Nevertheless, it can raise important questions.
