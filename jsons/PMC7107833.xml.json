Of 79 patients who were screened, 39 were excluded before randomization (33 patients) or were excluded from analysis (6 patients), and 16 were excluded because they were found to be bacteremic. The diagnosis was based on quantitative cultures of lavage specimens. Patients randomly assigned to aerosol treatment were to receive ceftazidime (15 mg/kg 8 times daily for 8 days) and a single administration of amikacin (25 mg/kg once daily for 3 days). In the control group, patients were given ceftazidime (30 mg/kg over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 90 mg/kg per day for 8 days) plus amikacin (15 mg/kg once daily for 3 days).",

Overall, however, no significant differences were detected between the treatment groups. Clinical success was achieved in 70% of the aerosol group and 55% of the IV group. Improvement of lung aeration, as determined by CT scans, also did not significantly differ between treatment arms. Bacterial eradication, however, occurred more often and more rapidly in the aerosol group. Elevation of minimum inhibitory concentrations of isolates to the intermediate or resistant range during therapy occurred only in the patients assigned to receive IV therapy. Overall, therapy was generally well tolerated. However, 3 adverse events occurred that were related to obstruction of the respiratory filter, and one of these resulted in nonfatal cardiorespiratory arrest.",

One hundred adults were randomized to receive, in addition to systemic therapy, normal saline or colistimethate equivalent to 75 mg colistin base by nebulization every 12 hours. The duration of therapy was left to the discretion of the clinicians. All isolates were susceptible to colistin; most infections were caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii or P. aeruginosa. Treatment was well tolerated in both groups. The incidence of favorable clinical outcomes was 51% in the group given nebulized colistimethate and 53.1% in the control group. There was also no significant difference in favorable outcomes between treatment arms among patients with P. aeruginosa infection (39.2% vs 28.6%; P = .36) or those with A. baumanii infection (69.6% vs 61.2%; P = .57). Favorable microbiologic outcomes, in contrast, were observed in 60.9% of recipients of nebulized colistimethate and only 38.2% (P = .03) of those in the control group.",

Infection was due to A. baumanii in 77%, to Klebsiella pneumoniae in 14%, and to P. aeruginosa in 9.3%; all isolates were susceptible to colistin. Clinical success (cure or improvement) was observed in 60% of the IV alone group and 74% (P = .10) of those assigned IV plus aerosol colistin. The mortality rates while still in the intensive care unit in the 2 groups were 42% and 24% (P = .289), respectively.

Although the population studied by Lu et al was more homogenous, because it was limited to patients with P. aeruginosa infection, the sample size was small (despite being conducted over 36 months at multiple centers), the patients and their treatment were complex, and lack of information about their parenteral therapy makes coming to firm conclusions difficult.",

In this study, no clinical benefit from the addition of nebulized to IV colistimethate was observed overall or individually with either of these pathogens. Finally, in a matched control study in which A. baumanii accounted for slightly more than three-fourths of infections, no significant benefit was detected by the addition of aerosolized to IV colistin.",

            "text": "It may be reasonable to conclude that, in a highly selected group of adults with nonbacteremic VAP due to P. aeruginosa, it may be possible to avoid IV therapy by administration of antibiotic combinations by nebulization alone. The addition of aerosolized to IV colistimethate, however, does not appear to improve clinical outcomes in patients with pneumonia due to gram-negative pathogens. Antibiotic administration by aerosolization, however, may more rapidly lead to bacterial eradication (although this may be an artifact resulting from antibiotic carry-over in cultures and was not seen in all studies) and may reduce the likelihood of emergence of drug resistance during therapy. The clinician must be aware of the important risk associated with the aerosol administration of at least some antibiotics\u2014clogging of respiratory filters with the potential, as in the study of Lu et al, of serious adverse effects.",
