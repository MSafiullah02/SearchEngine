These foreign bodies can thus become foci for infections and allow bacteria to escape immune control [ 45 ] without altering their pathogenicity [ 46 ] . Neutropenia and innate immune dysfunction following postinduction therapy and transplantation may also help facilitate biofi lm formation [47] [48] [49] .

The majority of cases are due to chemotherapy-associated bacterial translocation from mucosal sites. Most early infections in these patients are caused by gram-positive organisms; however, GNRs are not infrequent in patients with severe mucositis or lower gastrointestinal GVHD. GNR resistance to prophylactic antibiotics is increasing [ 43, 54 ] .

In addition, when addressing this topic, there is a large variation on the strength of clinical evidence in the literature. Randomized clinical trials evaluating treatment and prevention of infections, for example, are the strongest for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and fungal infections, but the majority of data are based either on retrospective clinical studies or on expert opinion. In this overview, we do not address the strength of evidence and instead refer you to more comprehensive guidelines and reviews whenever possible throughout the chapter [ 31, 32 ] .

Patients with bloodstream infections are usually febrile, but fever may be masked in some patients on immunosuppression, particularly those on high-dose steroids. Hypothermia is an infrequent presentation. Careful examination of the central venous catheter (CVC) may provide visual clues that suggest infection, such as erythema or purulence around the line or exit site; some patients may complain of chest wall pain or numbness at sites of catheter placement. A thorough skin exam is also important, as some patients develop skin nodules, ecthyma gangrenosum, or other lesions during episodes of bacteremia [ 41, 42 ] or fungemia [ 43, 44 ] . The development of hypoxia, renal insuffi ciency, and liver function abnormalities are ominous signs of developing septic shock and multiorgan failure.",

Gram-negative and gram-positive organisms can get into the CNS and lead to meningitis during treatment, and although rare, resistant bacteria may be more common due to prior antibiotic exposure. Communityacquired meningitis caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae is infrequent, but due to alterations in humoral immunity, emerging microbial resistance and a move to more outpatient care can occur late posttransplant and during periods of treatment for GHVD [ 100, 101 ] . Rothia mucilaginosa , a gram-positive organism that is a commensal organism in oral fl ora, is associated with a rare, but severe, meningitis that occurs almost exclusively during periods of severe mucositis [ 102 ] . Central line-associated bacteremia rarely leads to ophthalmic infection causing sight-threatening endophthalmitis or brain involvement [ 103, 104 ] , and even less frequently, bacteria can gain access through intracranial interventions such as Ommaya port placement [ 105 ] . Some bacteria have a known predilection for the CNS and may not be addressed by standard prophylaxis strategies. Listeria monocytogenes is a non-spore-forming gram-positive rod that is most commonly acquired as a food-borne illness with a particular penchant for involving the CNS [ 106 ] . Nearly 50% of immunocompromised patients who develop listeriosis develop CNS disease [ 107 ] , which can present as acute cerebritis or brain abscesses ( Fig. 12. 2 ). Nocardia species are fi lamentous bacteria that usually lead to pulmonary infections, of which over 30% develop CNS lesions; most commonly single or multiple abscesses. Many with CNS involvement are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, so routine brain imaging is recommended in all patients diagnosed with Nocardia [ 108 ] .",

An MRI of the brain demonstrated an abscess ( yellow arrow ) with surrounding edema. Blood cultures were positive for gram-positive rods which were later indentifi ed to be Listeria monocytogenes. Symptoms improved after institution of ampicillin and gentamicin therapy. The patient improved after a prolonged course of antibiotics 4 weeks posttransplant, and symptoms can range from mild delirium and cognitive dysfunction to seizures and encephalitis [ 125 ] . Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is another neurotropic virus primarily associated with encephalitis, though vasculopathy can also be associated with CNS involvement [ 126 ] . Interestingly, although VZV reactivation usually presents with prominent skin involvement (herpes zoster), patients with CNS disease may present without rash [ 127, 128 ] . Herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis can also occur in leukemia and transplant recipients, though patients are more likely to present with personality changes and focal abnormalities [ 129 ] . Additionally, both HSV and VZV can present with involvement in the otic branch presenting with unilateral facial paralysis, ear pain, and vesicles in the auditory canal and auricle (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) [ 130, 131 ] . CNS involvement of both VZV and HSV usually occurs only after the discontinuation of prophylactic acyclovir; such prophylaxis has not been shown to prevent HHV-6. Other latent herpesvirus infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [ 132 ] and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [ 133, 134 ] , can also cause CNS disease and, in EBV's case, can be associated with both encephalitis and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) [ 37, 135 ] .",

International criteria for the diagnosis of fungal infections, which include radiologic fi ndings, can help providers determine which patients should receive antifungal therapy [ 212 ] .

Pulmonary consolidation [ 213 ] and nodular disease [ 214 ] have also been described for viral infections (e.g., CMV, HMPV).

Cultures, cytology, and antigen testing (e.g., GM from BAL) [ 215 ] can all provide additional microbiologic evidence to avoid the institution of empiric therapies (see Table 12 .2 ). Additionally, this modality may help to evaluate other nonfungal infections, separate specifi c pathogens from each other, detect coinfections, and provide samples for antimicrobial resistance testing. While PCR-based strategies for specifi c fungal pathogens are still under development, PCR-based respiratory testing for viral pathogens from BAL samples is becoming standard at many centers [ 209, 220 ] . PCP is classically diagnosed from induced sputum samples in other immunocompromised populations (e.g., HIV); however, bronchoscopy may enhance diagnosis in transplant recipients due to the low burden of disease [ 223, 224 ] . CMV shell vial assays and cultures from BAL are also necessary criteria for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia [ 225 ] . A microbiologic diagnosis is important to allow targeted treatment and can help determine the duration of therapy. When a diagnosis of a pulmonary process is not made by BAL, video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy (VATS) or CT-guided biopsy may be necessary to determine the cause of the pulmonary symptoms. For sinus infections, Otolaryngology evaluation should be obtained in all high-risk patients with sinus symptoms, as early nasal/sinus endoscopy with visual inspection, and biopsy can allow for more prompt diagnosis.",

Candida species are commonly associated with this phenomenon, but any bacteria can lead to this complication [ 234 ] . Endocarditis in this population is an uncommon outcome following transplantation. These cases are often due to Streptococcus , Staphylococcus , or Enterococcal species, but other rare GNRs and atypical organisms have occasionally been reported [ 235 , 236 ] ; nearly all cases involve the right side of the heart unless patients have known underlying valvular pathology [ 235 ] . Candida or other fungal endocarditis is rare but associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [237] [238] [239] . Interestingly, noninfectious etiologies of endocardial masses (thrombi or marantic changes) can lead to similar symptoms in this population [ 236, 240 ] . Invasive fungal infections of the myocardium can also occur, but most are associated with primary pulmonary involvement or dissemination [ 241, 242 ] . Rare bacterial and fungal processes can lead to purulent pericarditis [ 243, 244 ] .",

Patients typically present with abdominal pain, but others can have only fever or nonspecifi c fi ndings; GI bleeding or perforation can be late signs of invasive involvement. The most frequent GI moulds are Aspergillus species and the Mucorales which can both lead to disease throughout the GI tract [ 263, 264 ] including the liver [ 265 ] .

Elevated liver transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, and rising bilirubin, can also suggest potential etiologies [ 294 ] . Viral testing including adenovirus PCR, norovirus PCR, and rotavirus EIA from stool can be considered for patients. All patients with known HBV exposure should have a HBV PCR at baseline, and if they develop severe transaminitis, have it repeated. Additionally, although CMV, EBV, and adenovirus PCRs from serum can suggest an underlying diagnosis, VZV and HSV PCRs from serum/plasma in the face of symptoms consistent with visceral zoster or acute hepatitis are of critical importance for diagnosis. Serum GM can be sent in patients who are felt to be at risk for gut-related Aspergillus but may be falsely positive in patients with severe mucosal breakdown or in those receiving piperacillin-tazobactam therapy [ 295, 296 ] .

Hepatosplenic candidiasis, for example, presents with multiple hypodense \"bull's eye\" lesions in the liver and spleen which are indicative of Candida abscesses within the liver [ 294 ] . Neutropenic enterocolitis typically demonstrates infl ammation and stranding around the cecum (Fig. 12.5 ) . Unfortunately, GI mould infections may be diffi cult to diagnose from imaging [ 264 ] , with many diagnosed following death (Fig. 12.6 ). Intervention may also be important in the work-up of patient's symptoms. In patients at risk for GVHD, gastroenterology consultation is suggested to evaluate by endoscopy. Endoscopic visualization and biopsies can help differentiate between viral infections (CMV and adenovirus) and GVHD and may detect other infectious lesions [ 297 ] . It is important to stress that more than one diagnostic method for CMV detection is needed in the GI tract [ 298 ] and that CMV PCR still needs to be validated as a diagnostic entity for the diagnosis. Surgical intervention or liver biopsy may be necessary particularly in patients without a clear diagnosis or if CT fi ndings are suspicious for a fungal process. Patients with severe neutropenic enterocolitis or those with severe abdominal pain may need emergent surgical consultation [ 258 ] .",

Dermatology consultation and biopsies can also help in making a diagnosis and may be necessary in some cases that have a large differential diagnosis.

In patients with increased concern for necrotizing fasciitis, a high lactate and abnormal chemistry panel (low CO 2 and elevated creatinine) can also be suggestive. Diagnosis must be confi rmed by visual inspection of the fascia and on pathologic review, so an urgent surgical consultation is required. Patients with lesions consistent with HSV or VZV should have lesions unroofed and samples from the base of the lesion sent for DFA, shell vial, and PCR.

Fever can be caused by numerous etiologies, and only about 20-30% of patients have documented infections during a neutropenic evaluation [ 39 ] . However, due to the high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with infections, most providers give standard prophylaxis during this period of risk. There are numerous risk categories that are reviewed in detail by Freifeld et al. and prevention strategies differ slightly between groups [ 39 ] . Patients receiving therapy for leukemia and transplant recipients are expected to have prolonged periods of neutropenia (>7-10 days) so are considered to be higher risk. Most centers and guidelines recommend the use of fl uoroquinolone prophylaxis in this population, and this appears to be as effective as IV ceftazidime [ 31, 57 ] . Due to the emergence of fl uoroquinolone-resistant S. viridans (particularly ciprofl oxacin) [ 346 ] , some centers add additional penicillin VK or amoxicillin to fl uoroquinolones [ 347, 348 ] and others early vancomycin in patients at high risk for this organism [ 349 ] . Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be considered in patients who have an allergy to fl uoroquinolones but is often not possible in patients with neutropenia [ 32 ] . Prophylaxis should be stopped after neutrophil recovery. Late strategies to prevent posttransplant S. pneumoniae and encapsulated bacteria in patients with chronic GVHD should be based on local resistance patterns [ 31 ] .",

In general, all of these specimens provide good sensitivity, although comparisons suggest that cell-free plasma may provide superior specifi city for PTLD [ 367 ] . Most authors favor a preemptive therapy similar to what is seen in CMV, in which detection of EBV DNA levels above a certain threshold triggers a reduction in immunosuppression or rituximab therapy [ 368, 369 ] . There are no current guidelines for a threshold for EBV viremia due to variances in testing and in transplant populations [ 31 ] . Other groups use \"prompt\" therapy in which treatment is triggered only when detection of EBV DNA is accompanied by overt signs of EBV disease. Prompt therapy has shown similar effi cacy to preemptive therapy [ 370 ] . Based on the concern that the delay in treatment may lead to increased complications, many groups still favor preemptive approaches [ 31, 301 ] . T-cell immunotherapeutic regimens are still experimental and not widely available.",
