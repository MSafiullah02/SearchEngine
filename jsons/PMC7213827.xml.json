She had a history of diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension. Her family confirmed previous contact with patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical examination in our Internal Medicine (\u2018Clinica Medica\u2019) department revealed the patient had bilateral crackles in both lungs. She was stable haemodynamically. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, blood tests and a chest x-ray were carried out. The ABG results showed mild hypoxemic hypocapnic respiratory failure, the chest x-ray showed bilateral signs of interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 1), and the blood tests showed lymphocytopenia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (42 mm), C-reactive protein (138 mg/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (471 U/l). Platelets were low (54 000/mm3) as was procalcitonin. These findings together with the history suggested the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Unfortunately, she developed ARDS and died from severe respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is first reported case of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and CMV. Our team have previously often found lymphocytopenia in other cases of CMV infection and reactivation, particularly in patients who had been given biological drugs. This merits investigation, as the literature [3] suggests a link between SARS-CoV-2 and CMV infection/reactivation caused by the increasingly widespread use of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-1 biological therapies in COVID-19.",
