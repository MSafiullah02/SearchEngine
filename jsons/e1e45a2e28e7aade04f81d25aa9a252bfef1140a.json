He worked as an employee in the property management company of his residential community until he was hospitalized. On January 29, he accompanied his wife to a local hospital due to a slight fever presented to his wife, who had experienced upper respiratory symptoms intermittently since last month.

He had undergone surgery of the duodenal papillary carcinoma 17 years ago. His body temperature was elevated to 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) and coarse breath sounds were heard in both lungs at auscultation. Laboratory studies showed elevation of C-reactive protein (203 mg/L; normal range, 0-10 mg/L), procalcitonin (0.100 ng/mL; normal range, 0-0.5 ng/mL), and D-dimer (1.13 mg/L; normal range, 0-0.55 mg/L). The white blood cell differential count showed 80.0% neutrophils and 9.9% lymphocytes. Unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scan manifested multiple peripheral lesions in both lungs. This patient contained all the characteristics of pneumonia (2) caused by 2019-nCoV. Some of the lesions presented with pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) (Fig. 1A) , GGO with interlobular septal thickening (Fig. 1B) , GGO with consolidation (Fig. 1C) , or prominent consolidation (Fig. 1D) . Most of the lesions were contained with consolidated composition, and no lung cavitation, pleural effusions, or lymphadenopathy were found. However, despite a long disease course and extensive lung lesions, this patient's first RT-PCR result was negative, indicating a low sputum viral load.",
