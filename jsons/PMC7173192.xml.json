Incubation of these cells with anti-galectin-3 antibodies raised against the N-terminus of the molecule before the addition of the HA-inducing anti-CD13 mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of HA at two hours of incubation (98.37% inhibition), whereas pre-incubation with an antibody against galectin-1, another galectin expressed in monocytes [25], did not inhibit CD13-induced HA at any time of incubation (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect of anti-galectin-3 antibodies was still evident after 24 h of incubation although the percentage of inhibition decreased progressively (Fig. 2B and D). This suggests that although galectin-3 is essential at the initial phases of CD13-mediated HA, a galectin-3-independent mechanism becomes involved at later phases. Because the anti-galectin-3 antibody used induces some HA (Fig. 2D, gal-3), residual HA could be due to galectin-3-induced HA and/or to an incomplete dependence of CD13 on galectin to mediate HA. Pre-incubation with anti-galectin-3 antibodies at 4 or 37 \u00b0C had the same inhibitory effect on HA, suggesting that the effect of anti-galectin-3 antibodies is not an energy-requiring process. Addition of the anti-galectin-3 antibody simultaneously with the anti-CD13 mAb resulted in a less significant inhibitory effect (Fig. 2C, co-incubation) suggesting that the participation of galectin-3 in CD13-mediated cell aggregation occurs at the initial steps following anti-CD13 mAb binding. In summary, these results demonstrate that blocking galectin-3 with antibodies significantly hampers the early steps of CD13-mediated HA.",

Consequently, a direct participation of galectin-3 in the mechanism of HA was hypothesized. An association between galectin-3 and CD13 was likely considering the predicted glycosylation characteristics of CD13 and the previously described interaction between galectin-4 and CD13 in the intestine. As shown in Fig. 3b, galectin-3 and CD13 co-immunoprecipitate from resting U-937 cells. Unexpectedly, induction of HA consistently diminished the amount of galectin-3 co-immunoprecipitating with CD13. These results show that galectin-3 is constitutively associated with CD13 and that induction of HA by the anti-CD13 mAb decreases this association. We have reported that during anti-CD13 mediated HA, the membrane levels of CD13 decrease to some extent due to its internalization [9]. Although the relevance of the CD13 internalization during HA is presently unknown, we tested the effect of anti-galectin-3 antibodies on this phenomenon. Galectin-3 antibodies did not inhibit CD13 internalization (Fig. 3c) suggesting that their inhibitory effect does not depend on disturbing this event.",

We found identical membrane levels of galectin-3 in aggregated and non-aggregated cells as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 3d), suggesting that the galectin-3 that dissociates from CD13 either binds to a different membrane receptor or oligomerizes with other membrane-associated galectin molecules. In this regard, it has been reported that monomeric galectin-3 has a tendency to oligomerize at high concentrations, specially with galectins already attached to an immobilized ligand (e.g. laminin or a membrane receptor) [24], [26]. If oligomerization of galectin-3 is important for CD13-mediated HA, this could explain why anti-galectin-3 antibodies are capable of inhibiting HA.",

Galectin-3 molecules that have dissociated from CD13 could participate in HA by interacting with other galectin-3 molecules or other galectin-3 receptors. Interaction of galectin-3 with molecules on neighboring cells may result in a \u201cbridging\u201d phenomenon as has been suggested for galectin-3 by other authors [18]. However, since CD13-mediated HA does not occur at 4 \u00b0C and is sensitive to inhibitors of protein kinases, it is likely that dissociated galectin-3 mediates cross-linking of CD13 and/or other membrane receptors thereby triggering transmembrane signals responsible for a pro-adhesive effect in the cell in which CD13 has been ligated. If this is true, incubation of one population of cells with the anti-CD13 mAb would induce their aggregation with calcein-labeled cells that had not been incubated with the mAb. As shown in Fig. 3e, after combining these two populations of cells, aggregates formed by both of them appeared. This result suggests that changes in the association of membrane proteins and signal transduction events induced through CD13 in one cell are sufficient to induce its adhesion to another cell in which no signaling has occurred. Next, to determine if the galectin-3 of the cells that were not incubated with anti-CD13 is involved in the aggregation observed in the previous experiment, the calcein-labeled cells were pre-incubated with the anti-galectin-3 antibodies at 4 or 37 \u00b0C before the assay. Aggregates appeared again formed by labeled and unlabeled cells (Fig. 3f) suggesting that the galectin-3 molecules involved in HA are mainly the ones on the cell that has been \u201cactivated\u201d through CD13.",

            "text": "Based in our observations, a model for the role of galectin-3 in CD13-induced HA can be proposed (Fig. 4\n). Galectin-3 is constitutively associated with CD13 in resting U-937 cells (Fig. 4A). Although a direct physical association is likely via highly glycosylated domains of CD13 such as the stalk or other domain, an indirect association through another receptor of galectin-3 complexed with CD13 can not be ruled out. Antibody binding to CD13 induces the release of galectin-3 from the targeted molecules and triggers a signal transduction event that results in changes in the adhesion properties of the cell. Conformational changes have been demonstrated after binding of substrates, inhibitors and antibodies to CD13 [27], [28]. Galectin-3 released from CD13 might participate in HA by different mechanisms. First, since membrane levels of galectin-3 do not change during HA and because of the results presented in Fig. 3f, dissociated galectin-3 appears to establish interactions with other molecules on the same cell (e.g. one of the known receptors for galectin-3 (integrins), a chemokine receptor, or other galectin-3 molecules). Galectin-3 has been shown to participate in integrin activation [29] and to be a chemoattractant for human monocytes/macrophages [30]. We have found that cells treated with the anti-CD13 mAb show a chemokinetic and later chemotactic behavior migrating to the zones where aggregates are starting to form [9]. Finally, it is known that galectin-3 can form homo-oligomers [24], [26] raising the possibility that galectin-3 molecules that have dissociated from CD13 participate in HA by a mechanism involving homo-oligomerization and/or bridging. The presence of excess lactose or anti-galectin-3 antibodies might inhibit galectin-3 oligomerization and/or the subsequent cross-linking of other receptors thus inhibiting HA.",

Although saturating concentrations of the anti-CD13 mAb do not induce HA when left in the medium during HA [9], they induce optimal aggregation levels when pre-incubated at 4 \u00b0C and washed to eliminate the excess of antibody (not shown). This suggests that an excess of antibody in the medium blocks interactions mediated by newly exposed epitopes. Cryptic epitopes have been shown to double after certain antibodies and substrates bind to the molecule [27]. In this scenario, CD13-bound galectin-3 could function as an epitope masker in resting cells.",
