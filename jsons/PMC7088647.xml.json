            "text": "Vaccines work by creating disease-specific immune memory cells that quickly quash future infections. For example, memory B-cell-derived plasma cells secrete antibodies that help remove extracellular pathogens, while memory CD8+ T-cells kill infected host cells to eliminate viruses inside. Immune protection requires the persistence of memory cells; yet, between infections the total number of memory cells returns to a relatively constant level (Freitas and Rocha 1993; Tanchot and Rocha 1995). Maintaining this homeostatic memory compartment size despite post-infection influxes requires that some existing memory be replaced by newly generated memory cells. Even when the memory compartment permanently grows after infection, some loss of prior memory can occur (Vezys et al. 2009). Thus, immune memory established via infections or vaccination can decline upon subsequent infections by other pathogens (De Boer et al. 2003; Selin et al. 1999). We explore the impact of new infections on existing immune memory under homeostatic constraints. For simplicity, we assume a constant homeostatic memory compartment size, but we discuss how to extend our models and results to allow for compartment growth.",

            "text": "Most infections add newly generated memory cells to a full memory compartment (Janeway et al. 2005). The resulting scarcity of survival signals like interleukin 15 (IL-15) prompts passive attrition, the death of memory cells following an infection to restore the homeostatic memory compartment size (Kennedy et al. 2000; Ku et al. 2000; Selin et al. 2006; Welsh et al. 2004b). Viruses such as SARS, measles, influenza, and West Nile also cause a large number of memory T-cells to die in the first 1\u20134 days of infection, a process called active attrition, and create an immune-deficient environment known as lymphopenia (Bahl et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2005; Selin et al. 2006; Welsh et al. 2004a, 2004b). Surviving memory cells as well as some naive cells then proliferate (and differentiate if necessary) to refill the memory compartment, a process termed lymphopenic (or homeostatic) proliferation (Almeida et al. 2005; Goldrath 2002; Sprent and Surh 2001). However, the memory compartment might not return to its previous composition, which means that immunity to some diseases could be weakened or lost (Selin et al. 1996, 1999).",

We focus on how the memory CD8+ T-cell population changes with new viral infections. Every T-cell possesses a T-cell receptor that recognizes a specific peptide sequence (antigen) complexed with MHC molecules. We define a T-cell lineage as all T-cells that possess the same T-cell receptor (i.e., a T-cell clone). The range and size of lineages covered by existing memory CD8+ T-cells defines the memory CD8+ T-cell repertoire. The composition of the memory repertoire determines the breadth of diseases against which the host is immune. We explore how active attrition, new memory generation, and homeostatic regulation of the memory CD8+ T-cell compartment impact the lineage distribution in the memory repertoire, and thus alter overall immunity.",

            "text": "Memory repertoire changes have been examined experimentally by infecting inbred mice with sequences of heterologous viruses and sacrificing them at different times to count disease-specific memory CD8+ T-cells (Selin et al. 1996, 1999; Chapdelaine et al. 2003; Bahl et al. 2006). However, inbred mice with the same infection history possess private specificities for diseases, so these repertoire snapshots cannot precisely show how memory lineages change in a single host (Kim et al. 2005; Welsh et al. 2006). Nevertheless, these experiments substantiate the hypothesis that memory to one disease is diminished upon subsequent infection with other pathogens (Brehm et al. 2004; Selin et al. 1996, 1999, 2006). Using MHC tetramers to observe changes in particular memory lineages following proliferative immune responses yields similar results (McNally et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2005). MHC tetramers have also shown that substantial attrition of bystander memory CD8+ T-cells occurs early in infection followed by an imperfect rebound in lineage frequencies leading into homeostasis (McNally et al. 2001; Kim and Welsh 2004; Selin et al. 2006). The authors hypothesize that post-infection (passive) attrition of memory cells should permanently alter the memory repertoire less than early, active attrition of memory (Kim and Welsh 2004; Selin et al. 2006).",

Sep\u00falveda et al. (2010) evaluate both the frequency and size of T-cell lineages within the T-cell repertoire at one time point using Poisson abundance models. Venturi et al. (2007) use statistical approaches to compare sampled repertoires of T-cells (including memory T-cells) from different mice to determine how individual hosts respond differently to infections. Three models examine how infections alter the memory repertoire over time. The first, by Antia et al. (1998) was extended by Ganusov et al. (2006); they model changes in memory CD8+ T-cell lineage sizes following infections that induce new memory cell generation followed by passive attrition to restore a constant homeostatic memory compartment size. They enforce compartment constancy via a frequency-proportionate decrease in all memory lineages after an infection, and find that decay in existing memory lineages is directly proportional to the total number of cells in previously unoccupied memory lineages and inversely proportional to the homeostatic size of the memory compartment (Antia et al. 1998; Ganusov et al. 2006). Selin et al. (2004) used IMMSIM, a cellular automata model of the immune system, to determine that active attrition hinders the growth of medium-affinity cross-reactive T-cell memory allowing new lineages with higher affinities to arise while passive attrition leads to lineage codominance.",

This allows us both qualitatively and quantitatively to examine how immunity conferred by memory CD8+ T-cells changes with infections and to predict how long immunity to a disease may last.

Correspondingly, higher degrees of attrition have higher coefficients of variation; larger compartments have smaller coefficients of variation because mean lineage sizes increase faster than their deviations.

Lineages that begin small are more prone to stochastic effects that allow larger lineages to dominate a greater percentage of the memory compartment. This causes the probability distributions for small initial repertoires to be more skewed than for larger initial repertoires and correspondingly less diverse. Comparing a 100-cell compartment that initially possesses an 8- and a 2-cell lineage (Fig. 3e) with a 1,000-cell compartment that begins with an 80- and a 20-cell lineage (Fig. 3f), we see that with a proportionate increase, the trends found for the smaller final compartment size hold for the larger compartment size as well. For these repertoires, the ratios of the mean final lineage size to the total compartment size for each lineage are nearly identical and the compartment becomes similarly less biodiverse as the second lineage\u2019s weight decreases. This suggests that the same qualitative and quantitative behaviors should hold for larger, more biological lineage sizes.",

Using the \u201cus versus them\u201d approach, we first pit the memory lineages against the naive lineages using the additive means of the weights and obtain the mean final number of memory cells and of newly differentiated naive cells (971 cells and 29 cells, respectively, in Fig. 4a). The two memory lineages then compete with their original weights to fill a 971-cell compartment (Fig. 4b) while the two naive lineages compete to fill a 29-cell compartment (Fig. 4c). In this way, we obtain the final-size probability distributions for each lineage. Thus, a more realistic number of lineages can be examined with these mathematical models by grouping lineages or by sequentially identifying lineage sizes. \n",

Attrition does not change the ratio of mean cells in lineage 1 versus lineage 2; only proliferation does this. Thus, the final mean cell ratio is impacted only by proliferation events and not by early or late attrition events.

We develop mathematical models of cellular attrition and proliferation that give insight into how the memory CD8+ T-cell repertoire changes as a result of viral infections. The models solve Markov death and birth processes for multiple coupled lineages. We employ them in sequence to explore how viruses that cull memory CD8+ T-cells in the first few days of infection alter the memory repertoire; for such infections, active attrition is followed by lymphopenic proliferation that restores the homeostatic memory compartment size but not necessarily the original lineage composition. We use the same models to investigate the impact on the memory repertoire of more typical antiviral immune responses characterized by antigenic stimulation of memory CD8+ T-cells, which leads to the generation of new memory cells; this creates a dearth of cytokine survival signals and can precipitate the passive attrition of memory cells to restore the homeostatic compartment size. Finally, we combine the models of active attrition and antigenically stimulated immune responses to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how active-attrition-inducing viruses alter the memory CD8+ T-cell repertoire. These results additionally allow us to compare the relative impacts of viruses that cause active attrition followed by proliferative recovery versus viruses that stimulate new memory cell generation followed by less drastic, but permanent, passive attrition.",

If bona fide memory cells refill a lymphopenic memory compartment, the lineages likely have the same proliferative propensity since the cells respond to the same lineage-independent antigen signals (McNally et al. 2001; Bahl et al. 2006; Chapdelaine et al. 2003). With equal lineage weights, the memory repertoire on average returns to the initial repertoire following the infection. However, the final-size probability distributions are skewed such that common lineages are more likely to grow in repertoires that contain rare lineages. As lineage sizes increase, the probability of a lineage extinction diminishes and the skews become more subtle. Larger degrees of attrition are associated with increased stochastic effects and higher extinction probabilities and thus require bigger lineage sizes to avoid distribution skewing. Correspondingly, the diversity of the memory repertoire decreases most substantially with high amounts of attrition and small compartment sizes. Larger compartments generally maintain lineage diversity despite attrition and proliferation events. Thus, in humans and other organisms, active attrition and lymphopenic proliferation of memory cells should have little lasting impact on the composition of the memory CD8+ T-cell repertoire, even in the presence of stochastic effects.",

There is evidence that naive cell contributions are small (Tanchot and Rocha 1995; Freitas et al. 2005), so unweighted bona fide memory cell proliferation should provide a good approximation to the full effects. If bona fide memory lineages and naive lineages compete to proliferate, then the bona fide memory population is reduced, and the spurious memories of newly differentiated naive cells successfully gain a foothold in the memory compartment.

In classic viral infections, which do not cause active attrition, new memory cell generation is followed by passive attrition to restore the homeostatic compartment size. If every lineage in the memory compartment recognizes and reacts to viral antigens, relative proliferation weights are vital. With similar weights, we find that lineages return to their initial sizes on average. With disparate weights, the lineage size ordering within the memory compartment can be drastically altered, and a single infection could cause the extinction of a previously common lineage. More often, only a few lineages react to the virus, which for computational feasibility we explore by grouping all cells that proliferatively respond to the infection in one lineage and placing nonreactive cells into a second lineage. The generation of 50 memory cells per proliferative precursor cell creates a vast memory pool with which the initially large, nonproliferating lineage must compete during passive attrition for space in the final compartment. Consequently, this bystander population diminishes substantially in size. The degree to which this occurs depends heavily on the ratio of the proliferative peak to the overall compartment size. The models predict that small acute infections tend to increase the number of disease-specific cells while avoiding the complete elimination of bystander immunity against other contagions. Conversely, acute viruses that stimulate large proliferative responses could eliminate the majority of the heterologous memory cells through natural homeostatic processes and significantly narrow the memory CD8+ T-cell repertoire.",

These indicate that, with only surviving memory cells contributing to lymphopenic proliferation, the initial repertoire is restored on average. An additional proliferative response should therefore cause proliferative lineages to increase their presence in the memory compartment, and subsequently reduce the number of nonproliferating cells during passive attrition.

Meanwhile, 80 % active attrition has an extinction probability of 10\u22123 while 20 % active attrition causes a lineage extinction with probability 10\u221221. Thus, while protective immunity against heterologous viruses is most likely to be lost under high degrees of active attrition, low amounts of active attrition incite extinctions less frequently than passive attrition. Sequential infections will exacerbate these effects. The probability that active-attrition-inducing viruses cause extinctions should be higher when they also antigenically stimulate new memory generation due to the added decay from passive attrition. Nevertheless, the final repertoires are nearly identical for active-attrition-causing infections and for viruses that do not induce active attrition, and therefore their extinction likelihoods should roughly match as well.

Therefore, regardless of whether active attrition precedes new memory cell generation, the initial lineage configuration cannot be restored, and some immunity will be lost. In contrast, active attrition followed by lymphopenic proliferation does not often reach low enough lineage sizes for stochastic extinctions to occur, and the compartment rebounds to the initial repertoire on average.

However, finding the final-size probability distributions would be more computationally intensive. Hence, we streamline the process by using the simplifying assumption that new memory cell generation is the direct result of precursor cell division. This assumption is reasonable when proliferation weights are roughly equal so that the number of new memory cells an infection generates may correlate with the number of activated precursor cells (De Boer et al. 2003; Kaech and Ahmed 2001). This method is also consistent with the fact that newly created memory cells are descendants of the original naive or memory cells, and it is precise under the hypothesis that naive cells asymmetrically differentiate into one effector cell and one memory cell if these memory cells also proliferate (Chang et al. 2007; Littman and Singh 2007).",

Accounting for this in our models requires changing one parameter: the final compartment size. Qualitatively, this will reduce the degree to which an infection alters precursor, non-cross-reactive lineage sizes. For instance, the likelihood of a lineage extinction due to passive attrition could drop to zero if the memory compartment expands so much that little passive attrition occurs. The limited effects of active attrition remain true whether or not passive attrition occurs.",

Yet, by comparing the results of different repertoire sizes, we have shown that the trends we identified also hold for larger compartments and larger numbers of lineages. Therefore, these characteristics should scale to biologically relevant cases in which lineages with 103 to 106 cells reside in a memory CD8+ T-cell compartment with 107 to 1010 cells. For larger compartments, the 50-fold expansion we assume during antigen-induced proliferation substantially underestimates the >1,000-fold expansion seen experimentally (Blattman et al. 2002). Thus, the final distribution changes we observe with small numbers may underestimate true shifts, and greater expansion will likely exacerbate the differences between immunity loss due to antigen-induced proliferation and passive attrition versus active attrition. We also assume that only two lineages (or two lineage groups) compete for proliferation signals at a given time to make computation times feasible. We discern the dynamics of multiple competing lineages by using an \u201cus versus them\u201d approach that pits each lineage against the rest of the memory compartment. This process can be cumbersome with a large number of lineages, but the attrition and proliferation models can nevertheless determine how multiple lineages interact to refill a lymphopenic compartment. Furthermore, the analytical models hold for any lineage and compartment size; thus, with faster numerical approaches or platforms, the final-size probability distributions can be calculated for more biologically realistic population numbers.",

Both may significantly narrow the memory repertoire through persistent or recurrent T-cell responses directed at a few antigens. Integrating the dampening effect of negative selection could be interesting. If antigens from a chronic virus become included in the antigen pool that defines self during selection, complete narrowing of the repertoire might be avoided. This could be modeled using dynamic proliferation weights that drop to zero when the peptides become recognized as self. Models like these might also apply to other immunological systems. Memory B-cells compete for limited niches (Freitas and Rocha 1993; Manz et al. 2005), but examining memory B-cell repertoire shifts involves tracking not only antigenic specificity but also immunoglobulin type and other factors. As biological and mathematical exploration advances our knowledge of immune repertoire dynamics, we gain better insight into how immunity evolves in a lifetime.",
