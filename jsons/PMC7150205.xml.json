These changes are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. Due to either limited fidelity of the replication apparatus copying the genome or physico-chemical activity of the environment, nucleotides may be changed, inserted, or deleted. Genomes of other origin may also be a source of innovation for a genome through the use of specially evolved mechanisms of genetic exchange (recombination). Accepted changes, known as mutations, may be neutral, advantageous, or deleterious, and depending on the population size and environment, the mutant lineage may proliferate or go extinct. Overall, advantageous mutations and large population size increase the chances for a lineage to succeed. The lineage fit is constantly re-assessed in the ever-changing environment and lineages that, due to mutation, became a success in the past could be unfit in the new environment. Due to the growing number of mutations accumulating in the genomes, lineages diverge over time, although occasionally, due to stochastic reasons or under similar selection pressure, they may converge.",

Phylogeny deals with past events and, therefore, it is reconstructed by quantification of differences accumulated between lineages. Due to the lack of fossils and (relatively) high mutation rate, viruses were not considered to provide a recoverable part of phylogeny until the advent of molecular data proved otherwise. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and, occasionally, other quantitative characteristics such as distances between three-dimensional structures of biopolymers, have been used to reconstruct virus phylogeny. Results of phylogenetic analysis are commonly depicted in the form of a tree that may be used as a synonym for phylogeny. For instance, all-inclusive phylogeny of cellular species is depicted as the Tree of Life (ToL).",

For inferring phylogeny, differences between the sequences of species members, assumed to be of a discernable common origin, are analyzed. If species in all lineages evolve at a uniform constant rate, like clock ticks, their evolution conforms to a molecular clock model. The utility of this model in relation to viruses may be very limited. Rather, related virus lineages may evolve at different and fluctuating rates and some sites may mutate repeatedly with each new mutation erasing a record about the prior change. As a result, the accumulation of inter-species differences may progress nonlinearly with the time elapsed. At present, our understanding of these parameters of virus evolution is poor and this limits our ability to assess the fit between a reconstructed phylogeny and the true phylogeny, with the latter practically remaining unknown for most virus isolates. This gap in our knowledge does not eliminate the conceptual strength of phylogentic analysis for reconstructing the relationships between biological species.",

In contrast to cellular species, which form three compact domains (kingdoms) and whose origin is traced back to a common ancestor in the ToL, major virus classes may combine species that have originated from different ancestors. Thus, reconstructing the comprehensive virus phylogeny requires comparisons that involve genomes of virus and cellular origins. This formidable task remains largely \u2018work in progress\u2019. In fact, most efforts in virus phylogeny are invested in reconstructing the relationships at the micro, rather than grand, scale and they focus on well-sampled lineages that have practical (e.g., medical) relevance. Phylogeny itself or in combination with other data may provide a deep insight into virus evolution and diverse aspects of virus life cycles, including virus interactions with their hosts.",

The entire process of generating contemporary species diversity from a common ancestor is believed to proceed through a chain of intermediate ancestors specific for different subsets of the analyzed species. The relationship between the common ancestor, intermediate ancestors, and contemporary species may be likened to the relationship between, respectively, root, internal nodes, and terminal nodes (leaves) of a tree, an abstraction that is widely used for the visualization of this relationship. Trees are also part of graph theory, a branch of mathematics, whose apparatus is used in phylogeny. Formally and due to a strong link between phylogeny and taxonomy, leaves may be called operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and internal nodes and roots, since they have not been directly observed, are known as hypothetical taxonomy units (HTUs). Nodes are connected by branches or edges.",

The topology is determined by relative position of internal and terminal nodes; it defines branching events leading to contemporary species diversity.

The branch length of a tree may define either the amount of change fixed or the time passed between two nodes connected in a tree, and is known as \u2018additive\u2019 or \u2018ultrametric\u2019, respectively. The tree shape may be linked to particulars of evolutionary process and reflect changes in the population size and diversity due to genetic drift and natural selection. The position of the root at the tree defines the direction of evolution. Species that descend from an internal node in a rooted tree form a cluster and the node is called most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the cluster that thus has a monophyletic origin. The branch lengths and the root position may be left undefined for a tree that is then called \u2018cladogram\u2019 and \u2018unrooted tree\u2019, respectively.",

The quality of alignment is among the most significant factors affecting the quality of phylogenetic inference. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, changes in polynucleotide sequences are accumulated at a higher rate than those in amino acid sequences. In viruses, including RNA viruses, this difference is not counterbalanced by other constraints linked to di-nucleotide frequency and RNA secondary (tertiary) structure. Because of these differences, phylogeny of closely related species is commonly inferred using polynucleotide sequences, while protein sequences, preserving better phylogenetic signal, may be used to infer phylogeny of distantly related species.",

The respective methods dealing with these quantitative characteristics are known as distance and discrete (character state). The distance methods are praised for their speed and are considered a technique of choice for analysis of large data sets. They are often designed to converge on a unique phylogeny, with none others being even considered. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) in which a constantly recalculated distance matrix is used to define the hierarchy of similarities through systematic and stepwise merging of most similar pairs at a time was the first technique introduced for clustering. The neighbor-joining (NJ) method uses a more sophisticated algorithm of clustering that minimizes branch lengths, and is the most popular among distance methods. Although different trees may be compared in how they fit a distance matrix, it is distance character-based methods that are routinely used to assess numerous alternative phylogenies in search for the best one in a computationally very intensive process. Due to the calculation time involved, assessing all possible phylogenies is found to be impractical for data sets including more than 10 sequences; for larger data sets different heuristic approximations are used that may not guarantee a recovered phylogeny to be the best overall. There are two major criteria for selecting the best phylogeny using character-state based information through either maximum parsimony (MP) or maximum likelihood (ML). In MP analysis, a phylogeny with a minimal number of substitutions separating analyzed species is sought. The ML analysis offers a statistical framework for comparing the likelihood of fitting different trees into the data in search for one with the best fit. The latter approach is mathematically robust and its statistical power may also be used in combination with other techniques of tree generation. Most recently, a Bayesian variant of the ML approach has gained popularity. It utilizes prior knowledge about the evolutionary process in combination with repeated sampling from subsequently derived hypotheses.",

            "text": "After a tree is chosen, it is common to assign support for internal nodes through assessing nodes\u2019 persistence in trees related to the chosen tree. One particular technique, called bootstrap analysis, in which trees are generated for numerous randomly modified derivatives of the original data set, is most frequently used. Each internal node in the original tree is characterized by a so-called bootstrap value that is equal to the number of nodes appearing in all tested trees. Although the relationship between bootstrap and statistical values is not linear, nodes with very high bootstrap values are considered to be reliable. If species evolve according to a molecular clock model, the root position in a tree could directly be calculated from the observed inter-species differences as a midpoint of cumulative inter-species differences. Alternatively, the root position may be assigned to a tree from knowledge about analyzed species that was gained independently from phylogenetic analysis. Commonly, this knowledge comes in the form of a single or more species which are assumed (or known) to have emerged before the \u2018birth\u2019 of the analyzed cluster. These early diverged species are collectively defined as \u2018outgroup\u2019, while the analyzed species may be called \u2018in-group\u2019. Also, a tree may be generated unrooted, a common practice in phylogenetic analysis of viruses for which the applicability of the molecular clock model remains largely untested and reliable outgroups may not be routinely available. In the unrooted tree, grouping of species in separate clusters may be apparent, although these clusters may not be treated as monophyletic as long as the direction of evolution has not been defined. These challenges are addressed by the development of new approaches that infer rooted trees without artificially restricting species evolution to a constant rate (known as relaxed molecular clock models).",

Under the first approach, genome-wide alignments are used for analysis. Due to complexities of the evolutionary process that may be region specific, reliable genome-wide alignments can routinely be built only for relatively closely related viruses whose analysis, however, may be further complicated by recombination events (see below). Using the second approach, genes with no evidence for recombination may be merged (concatenated) in a single data set that may be used to produce a superior phylogenetic signal compared to those generated for distinct genes or entire genomes. For viruses with small genomes or for a diverse set of viruses, it is common practice to use a single gene to infer virus phylogeny. Although the results produced may be the best models describing evolutionary history of a group of viruses, the validity of this gene-based approach for the genome-wide extrapolation remains a point of debate.",

Trees may also become incongruent due to various technical reasons related to the size and diversity of a virus data set and deviations of the evolutionary process among lineages.

Answers to these questions form the basis for implementing immediate practical measures and prospective planning enabling specific and rapid virus detection and epidemic containment, which may include the use and development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.

For these viruses, there exist large databases of previously characterized isolates and strains that comprehensively cover the natural diversity. Should a newly identified virus belong to one of these species, chances are that it has evolved from a previously characterized isolate or a close variant and this immediately becomes evident in the clustering of these viruses in the phylogenetic tree. Combining the results of gene-specific and genome-wide phylogenetic analysis allows one to determine whether recombination contributed to the isolate origin. For instance, recombination was found to be extremely uncommon in the evolution of HCV, but not for poliovirus lineages that recombine promiscuously, also with closely related human coxsackie A viruses, both of which belong to human enteroviruses.",

This was the case with many emerging infections including those caused by most recently introduced Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus, and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). With the latter virus, poor sampling of the coronavirus diversity in the SARS-CoV lineage at the time, some uncertainty over the relationship between phylogeny and taxonomy of coronaviruses, and the complexity of phylogenetic analysis of a virus data set including isolated distant lineages led to considerable controversy over the exact evolutionary position of SARS-CoV among coronaviruses.

In this quest, phylogenetic analysis canalizes the effort and provides crucial information for reconstructing parameters of major evolutionary events that promoted the virus origin and spread. For instance, intertwining HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) lineages in the primate lentivirus tree led to postulation that the existing diversity of HIV in the human population originated from several ancestral viruses independently introduced from primates over a number of years. Similar phylogenetic reasoning was used to trace the origin of a local HIV outbreak to a common source of HIV introduction through dental practice (known as \u2018HIV dentist\u2019 case).

Phylogenetic considerations also played an important role in forming recently established families, for example, the Marnaviridae and Dicistroviridae.
