The first is exponential growth, widely studied in analysis of early-time data. The second is a self-exciting branching process model which includes a delay in transmission and recovery. It allows for meaningful fit to early time stochastic data. The third is the well-known Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR) model and its cousin, SEIR, with an \"Exposed\" component. All three models are related quantitatively, and the SIR model is used to illustrate the potential effects of short-term distancing measures in the United States.",

Put in place at an early stage, distancing measures that reduce the virus's reproduction number -the expected number of individuals that an infected person will spread the disease to -may allow much-needed time for the development of pharmaceutical interventions, or potentially stop the spread entirely. By slowing the speed of transmission, such measures may also reduce the strain on health care systems and allow for higher-quality treatment for those who become infected. The models presented here demonstrate that relaxing these measures in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions prior to the outbreak's true end will allow the pandemic to reemerge. Where this takes places, social distancing efforts that appear to have succeeded in the short term will have little impact on the total number of infections expected over the course of the pandemic. This work is intended for a broad science-educated population, and includes explanations that will allow scientific researchers to assist with public health measures. We also present examples of forecasts for viral transmission in the United States. The results of these models differ depending on whether the data employed cover infected patient counts or mortality. In addition, many aspects of disease spread, such as incubation periods, fraction of asymptomatic but contagious individuals, seasonal effects, and the time between severe illness and death are not considered here.",

For COVID-19, we expect an exponential growth phase during the first 15-20 days of the outbreak, in the absence of social distancing policies. This estimate is based on patient data from the Wuhan outbreak, which indicate that the average time from illness onset to death or discharge is between 17 and 21 days for hospitalized patients [27, 42] . Because they are a fraction of infections, deaths initially increase at a similar exponential pace, with some delay relative to the beginning of the outbreak. These observed doubling time estimates are significantly smaller than early estimates (\u223c7 days) obtained using data collected in Wuhan from field investigations [19] .",

Both models are fit, using maximum likelihood estimation with a Poisson likelihood, to data for three US States (CA, NY, and IN) [6] . The results are shown in Table 1 with a comparison to HawkesN. We use the Akaike information criteria [1] to measure model performance for each dataset; it is biased against models with more parameters. The SEIR model performs better on the Confirmed data for California and New York State, possibly due to the larger amount of data, compared to mortality for which SIR is the best for all three states. HawkesN performs best for confirmed cases in NY. Dimensionless models are commonly used in physics to understand the role of parameters in the dynamics of the solution (a famous example being the Reynolds number in fluid dynamics). The compartmental models (4) have a dimensionless form. There are two timescales dictated by \u03b2 and \u03b3, so if time is rescaled by \u03b3, \u03c4 = \u03b3t, and s = S/N , i = I/N , and r = R/N represent fractions of the population in each compartment, then we retain only one dimensionless parameter R 0 that, in conjunction with the initial conditions, completely determines the resulting behavior. There are three timescales in SEIR, thus resulting in a dimensionless equation with two dimensionless parameters. For SIR, given an initial population with r(0) = 0 and any sufficiently small fraction of initial infected = i(0), the shapes of the solution curves s(\u03c4 ), i(\u03c4 ), r(\u03c4 ) do not depend on , other than exhibiting a time shift that depends logarithmically on (Fig, 2) . This is a universal similarity solution for the SIR model in the limit of small (Fig. 3) , depending only on R 0 . Critically, the height of the peak in i(t) and the total number of resistant/susceptible people by the end of the epidemic are determined by R 0 alone. But, the sensitivity of the time translation to the parameter , and the dependence of true time values of the peak on parameter \u03b3 makes SIR challenging to fit to data at the early stages of an epidemic when Poisson statistics and missing information are prevalent. All of this is important information for public health officials, policymakers, and for political leaders to understand, in terms of the importance of decreasing R 0 for potentially substantial periods of time, explaining why projections of the outbreak can display large variability, and highlighting the need for extensive disease testing within the population to help track the epidemic curve accurately.",

This variability illustrates the tremendous challenge of making accurate predictions of the course of the epidemic while still in its early stages and while operating under very limited data. At the same time, this uncertainly may lend weight to the idea of erring on the side of caution, and continuing current social measures to curtail the pandemic.

If we assume S \u2248 N in equations (4), then dI(t)/dt \u2248 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)I, with the exponential solution I(t) = I 0 e \u03b1t with \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 and I 0 the initial number of infections. We expect at very early times (t 1/\u03b3) that the recovery will lag infections so one might see \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2 at very early times and then reduce to \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 once t > 1/\u03b3. Reports and graphs disseminated by the media typically report cumulative infections, which include recoveries and deaths. Using the SIR model, cumulative infections are I c (t) = I(t) + R(t) and evolve as dI c (t)/dt = \u03b2sI. Integrating this, we see that I c likewise grows exponentially with the same rate \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3. An important observation is that the doubling time for cumulative infections (T d = ln(2)/\u03b1) will change during the early times, with a shorter doubling time while (t 1/\u03b3) and a longer doubling time when t > 1/\u03b3.",

The process satisfies P (dC t = 1) = \u03b2S t I t dt/N + o(dt) P (dR t = 1) = \u03b3I t dt + o(dt) , which then gives the rate of new infections and new recoveries as [31] \u03bb I (t) = \u03b2S t I t /N, \u03bb R (t) = \u03b3I t .",
