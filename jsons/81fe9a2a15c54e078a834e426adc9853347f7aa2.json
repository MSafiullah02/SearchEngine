            "text": "The highly predictable increase in emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and unscheduled physician consultations for childhood asthma in North America every September is uniquely related to school return. Rhinovirus infection is likely the major trigger, initially affecting asthma in school-age children, followed by similar but lesser increases in asthma morbidity in younger children and in adults. Low use of asthma medications during summer may fuel the epidemic, which may be attenuated by the short-term addition of an effective controller therapy. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;120: 526-9.) Hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and physician consultations for childhood asthma increase with predictable regularity every September in many Northern Hemisphere countries. Epidemics have been reported in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Israel, Finland, Trinidad, and Canada, where 20% to 25% of all childhood asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization have occurred in September. 1 Fig 1 shows cycles of asthma hospitalization from 1990 to 2004 in school-age children in Canada. The stability of the pattern in timing and the amplitude of the peak in relation to the rest of the yearly cycle suggests that the factors underlying the epidemic are constant.",

Rather, we concluded that the September peak has such highly predictable timing because it is related directly to the date of school return, and that the initial focus of the epidemic is in school-age children, most notably those at the beginning of their schooling. Viral infections, predominantly rhinovirus, have been shown to be associated with approximately 80% of asthma exacerbations in this age group. 4 Rhinovirus infections are most common in early fall, and school-age children introduce rhinovirus infections into their families 3 times more frequently than working adults. 5 Our observation that the September peak in school-age children occurs earlier in northern areas of Canada suggests that opportunities for transmission of infection may be greater, possibly because of increased contact on school buses or in closed classrooms.",

There is a rapid acceleration in uptake of these prescriptions, again particularly in children, after school return. In addition, compliance with inhaled corticosteroids is generally poor and could be even lower in summer months when children are on vacation and out of routine.",

Increasing adherence to prescribed inhaled asthma control medication before and during the school return period could be beneficial but is unlikely to be achieved through interventions easily and economically conducted in general practice. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can reduce exacerbations in children with persistent asthma 9 and morbidity in children with intermittent apparent viral-induced wheezing. 10 We considered that addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists to usual therapy over the time of the epidemic may offer advantages in that the therapeutic effects occur shortly after inception of treatment and oral medication can easily and safely be added to existing asthma therapy.",

Children receiving montelukast experienced a 53% reduction in days with worse asthma symptoms compared with placebo (P < .02) and a 78% reduction in unscheduled physician visits for asthma (P 5 .011). The benefit of montelukast was seen both in those using and not using regular inhaled corticosteroids, and among those reporting and not reporting colds during the trial.",
