In humans, Borrelia spp. are the causative agents of a major disease: Lyme borreliosis (LB) (mainly caused by B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto). LB is also an important disease of domestic animals and wildlife worldwide. LB-group spirochetes, commonly known as B. burgdorferi s.l., cause one of the most significant natural zoonosis diseases that is carried and transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks (Wodecka et al., 2010). There are at least 20 genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l., which are classified based on their genetic differences. More than six of these genospecies have been reported in China (B. burgdorferi s.s., B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. sinica and B. yangtze) (Yu et al., 2016). B. garinii is the main genospecies and is distributed mainly in northern China, while B. burgdorferi s.s. is widely distributed in south China (Chen et al., 2013; Wan et al., 1998). B. burgdorferi s.l. has been detected in more than 20 mammalian species and seven genera of birds (Li, 2009). Studies have shown that in addition to humans, at least six other taxa of mammals (sheep, cattle, horses, dogs, cats and mice) and two types of birds (seabirds and migratory birds) can be infected by Borrelia spirochetes in China (Keesing et al., 2009). Previous research used antibodies to detect the Borrelia spp. antigen within camel sera in Egypt and reported a positive rate of 47.8% (Helmy, 2000).",

The aim of this study is to understand the role of camels as carriers and potential spreaders of Lyme disease in China. The exposure of camels to B. burgdorferi s.l. complex was investigated using PCR assay and sequencing. The sequences of the 5S-23S rRNA, OspA, flaB and 16S rRNA genes obtained from positive DNA samples were analysed, and the ticks that potentially act as vectors were discussed.",

The primer sequences are shown in Table 1\n. First-round PCR reactions were performed in a thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) with a total volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 2.5 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer (Mg2+ Plus), 2.0 \u03bcl of each dNTP at 2.5 mM, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 1.0 \u03bcl of template DNA, 1.0 \u03bcl of each primer (10 pmol), and 17.25 \u03bcl of distilled water. The PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C; 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s (annealing temperatures of primers are listed in Table 1), and 72 \u00b0C for 30\u201348 s (depending on amplicon size); with a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Nested PCR reactions included 1 \u03bcl of the first-round PCR product as template for another 30 cycles with the same parameters and annealing temperature profile as described above and in Table 1. To avoid cross-contamination and sample carryover, pre- and post-PCR processing and PCR amplification was performed in separate rooms. B. garinii SZ genomic DNA (from Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute) was used as a positive control, while distilled water was used as a negative control. PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and some positive amplicons from the second round of PCR amplification were directly used for sequencing (GENEWIZ, Inc. Beijing China) or cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Positive colonies were then selected for PCR amplification and sequencing.",

The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences indicated that the 16S rRNA gene sequences (5 from Aksu, 3 from Ili) from our study formed three distinct clades. The five AKU (Aksu) strains cluster within a sub-clade of one of three main clades, forming a sister clade with the B. garinii 16S rRNA sequences from China. Interestingly, the strains from the Ili area belonged to two different clades, with two sequences of B. garinii and B. burgdorferi belonging to the LD Borrelia spp. group and one sub-clade of B. theileri belonging to RF Borrelia spp. group. In general, the results show the presence of high heterogeneity among the 16S rRNA sequences of the 8 different Borrelia species strains (Fig. 2). The 5S-23S rRNA sequences formed two distinct clades: 4 strains (2 from Aksu and 2 from Zhangye) formed two distinct sub-clusters in the Borrelia 5S-23S rRNA phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3). The 5S-23S rRNA sequences from the 2 Aksu strains (AKU3\u201312 = AKU2 of 16S rRNA, AKU3\u201338 = AKU4 of 16S rRNA) and one Zhangye Borrelia spp. strain belong to one clade of the same branch, which are sister to B. garinii 16S rRNA. One Zhangye strain of the 5S-23S rRNA sequence was located within the same branch (Fig. 3). A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on all the Borrelia flaB sequences deposited in GenBank and two sequences (AKU3-14 = AKU3 of 16S rRNA and AKU3-45 = AKU5 of 16S rRNA) obtained in this study. The flaB sequences from Borrelia spp. formed two main clades. The sequences of the two Aksu strains clustered together with the B. garinii flaB sequences (Fig. 4). Two distinct clades were formed from the sequences of the Borrelia spp. OspA phylogenetic tree. The sequences of two strains from Zhangye clustered with the B. burgdorferi OspA sequences (Fig. 5).",

According to our knowledge, this is the first report of Borrelia spp. infection in camels in China, indicating their reservoir role in the maintenance of this organism in the environment. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of Borrelia spp. detected from the Aksu region had the highest infection rate (11.6%), followed by the Ili region (6.1%). The genetic identity of B. burgdorferi spirochetes can be clarified by their differential reactivity with genospecies-specific PCR primers targeting the 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer amplicon gene. Genetic heterogeneity should be further classified by analysing longer sequence data among B. burgdorferi strains that have been previously identified as the same genospecies of atypical strains of Borrelia spirochetes (Mathiesen Jr et al., 1997; Postic et al., 1998). Moreover, the 16S rRNA gene was detected at a higher positive rate in blood examined for Borrelia spirochetes than other genes in previous research (Wodecka et al., 2010). Our study showed that the infection rate of these genes decreased in the order 16S rRNA >5S-23S rRNA > flaB > OspA.",

In the present study, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s. were identified in camels from Aksu and Ili in Xinjiang Province. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that those isolates were closely related to the corresponding genotypes based on 16S rRNA gene with high sequence similarities (99.4%\u2013100%, GenBank accession numbers: CP007564; 100%, GenBank accession numbers: AY342028), although the bootstrap values of the phylogenetic tree were relatively low. This finding suggested the genetic diversity of B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s in different hosts and geographic locations. Interestingly, the sequencing of cloned PCR products from the 16S rRNA gene of Borrelia spp. from the Ili region showed the presence of a new Borrelia species belonging to the relapsing fever group. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Borrelia sp. obtained from camel has a 99.5%, 99.8% and 99.8% similarity to the gene of B. theileri KAT strain, Borrelia sp. 120618D12 and Borrelia sp. 130707_13_HJF, respectively (GenBank accession numbers: KF569941, AB897890 and AB897891).

B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s. were highly prevalent in the sampling areas of the two provinces surveyed. Further studies concerning the prevalence of Borrelia spp. groups for both Lyme disease and relapsing fever should be performed to confirm the presence of these different Borrelia species in camels within China. Our findings suggest that Borrelia infection in camels could potentially present a concern for public health. More detailed and widespread monitoring of tick populations and the screening for Borrelia in a greater variety of hosts are warranted in future studies.",
