We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of 47 65 gained.

In the context 185 of prioritisation, avoidance of a six-month delay restitutes on average 4.1 RALYGs in the 186 former group, compared to 0.7 in the latter ( Table 3, Supplementary Table 5 ). Wide local 187 excision for breast cancer has low resource requirement and therefore confers substantial 188 RALYGs, even in good prognosis subtypes. For aggressive cancers, our analysis demonstrates that even short delays (three months) 248 have a significant impact on patient survival. However, even for cancers of comparatively 249 favourable prognosis, a delay of six months will result in significant summed attributable 250 deaths as many of these cancers are common. Delay will also result in tumours being more 251 advanced, meaning not only is survival poorer, but that the upstaged cancers will be more 252 costly to treat both in terms of surgery and/or chemotherapy. Furthermore, resource 253 requirements (for example, ICU stay) are dramatically higher for the many who will Materials). Active focus is required to establish 'cold' sections of the healthcare system, 285 with rigorous protocols for staff screening and shielding protocols. This will serve to 286 minimise nosocomial acquisition and mortality from COVID-19, to protect staff, and also to 287 provide reassurance to the public regarding uptake of diagnostics and surgery for cancer. Given an accrued backlog of cases and ongoing tight competition for resources, decisions 295 regarding surgical prioritisation may be required for a number of years, with capacity 296 varying geographically and temporally. Recognising its limitations regarding assumptions 297 and parameters, we propose a model that provides a rational approach by which to 298 evaluate across patients of different ages, tumour types, and stages, the benefit and 299 resource implications of their cancer surgery. We highlight in our model those age-stage 300 groups for which COVID-related mortality currently exceeds survival benefit for surgery 301 and/or SACT. Whilst these and other groups for whom benefit is marginal will be the most 302 rationale to delay, they will nevertheless require monitoring and surgery downstream.",

Whilst 74 COVID-19 causes minimal or mild illness in most, a small but appreciable proportion of 75 individuals require oxygen therapy and often admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The 76 ensuing unprecedented pressure on hospital wards and ICUs has necessitated rapid 77 redeployment of staff and capacity towards the management of COVID-19 cases with 78 deprioritisation of non-emergency clinical services, including diagnostics and elective 79 specialist surgery. Concurrently, lockdown of the population has impacted dramatically on 80 presentation and referral of symptomatic patients from primary into secondary care[1]. 81 82 For patients with cancer, delay of surgery has the real potential to increase the likelihood of 83 metastatic disease, with some patients' tumours progressing from being curable (with near 84 normal life expectancy) to non-curable (with limited life expectancy)[2]. The situation has 85 been further exacerbated by recent safety concerns regarding aerosol generation from 86 endoscopy, cystoscopy and surgery[3, 4]. 87 88 Current projections indicate that COVID-19-related disruption may well last for 18 months 89 or more, until there is either long term effective containment in the population or large-90 scale vaccination.",
