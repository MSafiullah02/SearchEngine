            "text": "BACKGROUND: Plasma fractionators have implemented many improvements over the past decade directed toward reducing the likelihood of pathogen transmission by purified blood products, yet little has been published attempting to assess the overall impact of these improvements on the probability of safety of the final product. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety margins for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), parvovirus B19, and variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) were calculated for the two fibrin sealants licensed in the United States and for thrombin. These products were selected because their use in a clinical setting is, in most cases, optional, and both were relatively recently approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, thrombin and fibrinogen both undergo two dedicated virus inactivation steps and/or removal steps in accord with the recommendations of regulatory agencies worldwide. Safety margins were determined by comparing the potential maximum viral loads in contaminated units to viral clearance factors, ultimately leading to the calculation of the residual risk per vial. RESULTS: The residual risk of pathogen transmission per vial was calculated to be less than 1 in 10 -15 for HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV for both fibrinogen and thrombin. Owing to the greater quantities that can be present and its greater thermal stability, the calculated risk for parvovirus transmission was 1 in 500,000 vials for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 10 7 per vial for thrombin. Assuming that vCJD is found to be present in plasma donations, its risk of transmission by these purified and processed plasma derivatives would appear to be very low. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen safety initiatives implemented by plasma fractionators over the past 10 to 20 years have resulted in products with excellent pathogen safety profiles. Of the agents examined, parvovirus continues to have the lowest calculated margin of safety. Despite this, parvovirus transmissions should be rare. Manufacturers are encouraged to continue exploring processes to further enlarge parvovirus safety margins and to continue exploring ways of eliminating prions.

These include 1) improved selection of donors, 2) use of plasma only from \"qualified\" donors who repeatedly pass viral screening procedures, 3) use of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) methods to detect and eliminate virus before the pooling of donor units, 4) inventory hold policies that allow interdiction of \"window-phase\" units before pooling, 5) employment of purification procedures shown to remove virus or prions should they be present, 6) the use of two complementary or \"orthogonal\" methods of virus inactivation, and 7) the engineering and design of facilities so as to prevent contamination of downstream process streams with upstream fractions.",

Two fibrin sealants, one from Omrix (New York, NY) and one from Baxter (Deerfield, IL), are licensed in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Omrix also recently received approval of a topically applied thrombin. While they cannot be used in all surgical settings, such as to control high-pressure (arterial) bleeds, these products have been shown to improve surgical outcomes, reduce the time to hemostasis, reduce blood loss, and reduce surgical complications. 8 Substitutes for these human plasma-derived hemostatic agents have also been developed, including bovine thrombin and recombinant-derived human thrombin. Bovine thrombin is antigenically distinct from human thrombin and has been shown to elicit antibodies when used in man. 9 These antibodies, as well as antibodies elicited to bovine impurities in the product, especially antibodies to coagulation factor (F)V, have resulted in severe bleeding complications due to cross-reaction with their human counterparts. [10] [11] [12] [13] Higher purification has reduced this complication, although a recent report 14 indicates that antibody formation still occurs. Products made by recombinant technology have their own, somewhat unique, issues. Depending on the gene construct used and the cell line chosen, the amino acid sequence may differ from that which occurs naturally, and differences in posttranscriptional processing often result in altered patterns of glycosylation or other molecular changes. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Consequently, immunogenicity is a potential problem that needs to be continually assessed. Also, depending on specific production details, manufacturing procedures must employ steps designed to inactivate and/or remove viral contaminants (and other potential pathogens) known to be present in the cell line and/or in the culture medium employed. 20 Additionally, in many circumstances, the higher cost associated with recombinant proteins limits their use.",

            "text": "In the past decade, many estimates of the viral safety of transfused whole blood and its components (i.e., red blood cells, platelet concentrates, and fresh-frozen plasma) have been published, with each passing year showing improved viral and bacterial safety. 21, 22 In the same time frame, aside from monitoring clinical outcomes and despite the aforementioned improvements, little has been published to assess the parallel increase in safety of manufactured plasma products. A recent publication by Janssen and colleagues 23 used a probabilistic, Monte Carlo model to estimate the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a hypothetical plasma derivative subjected to what appears to be a single method of viral inactivation. Based on their assumptions, they calculated that the risk per vial approximated 1 in 1 million. Given these improvements, the recent licensure of human plasma-derived topical thrombin, and the frequent surgical use of fibrin sealants, consisting of fibrinogen in addition to thrombin, it is timely to estimate their pathogen safety. These estimates are especially useful since the fibrinogen component of fibrin sealants is among the least processed blood derivatives, while the manufacturing procedures for thrombin, whether part of a fibrin sealant kit or used by itself, are typical of those employed with most newer plasma derivatives. Thrombin and fibrinogen both undergo two dedicated virus inactivation steps and/or removal steps. Fibrinogen and thrombin from each company are each treated by solvent/detergent (S/D). Additionally, Omrix pasteurizes its fibrinogen and nanofilters its thrombin, while Baxter vapor heats both components following lyophilization. The fibrinogen preparation cannot be nanofiltered without suffering large losses in fibrinogen and fibronectin due to their large size. The presence of fibronectin may be important since it contributes to cell adhesion. 24 For HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HBV, this report updates estimates made by one of us (BH) in 1990 25 using better information on viral loads than was available then and enlarges the pathogen list to include hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus, both of which are nonenveloped viruses, and the prion that causes variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). It is anticipated that the method of approach reported here can be applied to other existing or experimental blood protein products.",

The first is to calculate safety margins by comparing the number of infectious units or doses of pathogen in the starting material to the clearance capacity of the manufacturing process. The second is to measure clinical outcomes, comparing the incidence of transmission to the quantity of product infused. Transmissions in a clinical setting should be considered the gold standard since they involve actually measuring what we want to know, and with this information, one can back-calculate clearance capacities of processes for known pathogen burdens. On the other hand, clinical studies of the type required can be extremely lengthy and expensive and the results possibly misleading. The former method has the advantage that estimates of safety can be made in advance of clinical testing. Moreover, the safety margins calculated for a wide range of viruses likely will also be applicable to unstudied and newly emerging viruses.",

These loads vary dramatically during the progressive stages of infection with the highest viral loads seen transiently during the acute preseroconversion (i.e., so-called window period) stage of infection; moreover, infectiousness is also highest during this same period. [28] [29] [30] Subsequent to antibody seroconversion (and coincident with innate and adaptive cellular immune responses to infection), the agents are 1) eliminated from the body (e.g., eradication of infection, as occurs with WNV, HAV, and dengue); 2) cleared from plasma but with persistence of cell-associated virus in tissues (e.g., latent infections such as herpes viruses, parvovirus B19, and \"occult\" HBV infections); or 3) persistent at reduced concentrations in plasma (i.e., so-called set-point viremia after establishment of chronic HBV, HCV, and HIV infections). In addition to variations in viral load measured by NAT, as infections evolve the infectivity of viruses change profoundly. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] For HIV (and its model agent simian immunodeficiency virus), HBV, HCV, and WNV, it is now well established that during the acute preseroconversion phase of infection (pre-ramp-up and ramp-up stages), virion particles in plasma are highly infectious, with 10 or fewer geq in the entire volume of plasma sufficient to transmit infection following parenteral injection. In contrast, viral particles present in plasma from the same infected individuals have significantly (10-to 1000-fold) reduced infectious potential weeks to years after seroconversion. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [40] [41] [42] [43] The reduced infectivity of plasma virus from postseroconversion phases of chronic infection is attributable to a combination of factors, including presence of endogenous neutralizing antibodies, generation of defective virions (i.e., lacking full genomes or other required infectivity factors), and immune selection of virions with reduced fitness. Hence, viral load distributions observed during acute versus chronic stages of infection need to be adjusted by a factor to account for the relative infectivity of virion particles to derive estimates for the functional viral load during each stage.",

Donors are also excluded if they have certain risk factors that make their exposure to viruses or prions more likely. Additionally, plasma manufacturers screen donated plasma in a minipool format for HBV, HAV, and parvovirus by NAT. The use of NAT greatly reduces viral loads since positive units missed by serologic screening procedures typically have the highest concentrations of virus, which is also highly infectious. Consequently, with very rare exceptions of concordant testing errors in serology and NAT screening, only units that test both serologically negative (i.e., window-phase units) and that have relatively low titers of infectious virus (<500-5000 infectious doses [IDs]/mL) are pooled. Furthermore, manufacturing pools are retested by NAT before fractionation to assure that high-titer viremic units were not missed as a result of erroneous testing. As a result, the probability that a fractionation pool contains a significant level of virus is extraordinarily remote.",

To estimate the number of positive units missed by the screening procedures employed, currently observed NAT yields, expressed as number of positive samples per million donations, were adjusted to account for the amount the window period is believed to be closed through the use of NAT. From this, we conclude that few plasma pools will contain HIV, HCV, or HAV while contamination by HBV and parvovirus B19 will be considerably more frequent. Based on the analytical sensitivity of the NAT assays, the dilution factors during assay, and the volume of an individual donor unit, we calculated the * For HIV, HCV, and HBV, a NAT yield unit is defined as an antibody-or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative donation detected by RNA and/or DNA screening using pooled NAT systems. Rates presented are published rates from United States and European whole-blood donor screening programs. [76] [77] [78] Although NAT yield rates for these viruses among source plasma donors are higher, this is offset by source plasma policies that stipulate that only plasma from \"qualified donors\" be released for fractionation and that frozen units be held in inventory enabling interdiction of quarantined potential window-phase units when donors later test reactive for infectious disease markers or are deferred for other reasons. 79 For HAV and parvovirus B19, we use the rate of detection of high titer viremic donations by low sensitivity NAT screening of whole-blood and plasma donors, irrespective of serostatus of viremic units. 80, 81 \u2020 The percentage is determined by dividing the number of days NAT detects positive samples by the number of days from when a donor becomes infectious until there is sufficient antibody to be detected serologically (HIV, HCV, HBV) or there is sufficient antibody to render the donation noninfectious (HAV, parvovirus; see Busch et al. 82 for conceptual basis for this approach and Kleinman and Busch 83 for application of this approach to HBV). The residual infectious window periods are defined as the number of days from viremia reaching the minimal infectious threshold (set as 1 copy per 20 mL of plasma; Busch et al. 84 ) to the level of viremia detected by pooled-sample NAT, using the viral doubling-times during the acute ramp-up phases established for each agent (20.5 hr for HIV, 10.8 hr for HCV, 2.6 days for HBV, and approx. 1 day for HAV and parvovirus B19). This yielded pre-NAT infectious window periods of 12 days for HIV, 7 days for HCV, 33 days for HBV, and 2 days for HAV and parvovirus B19. The NAT detection windows are based on time from reaching the 50 percent sensitivity of the NAT screening assays to the point of seroconversion for HIV (11 days), HCV (50 days), and HBV (10 days) or the duration of the estimated NAT yield window period for HAV (5 days) and parvovirus B19 (5 days). \u2021 We assumed that the 50 percent sensitivity levels for assays used by source plasma donors are in the same range as those reported by the National Genetics Institute (NGI). NGI NAT assays are used by approximately 60 percent of the source plasma sector for all five viruses, as well as by the American Red Cross for HAV and parvovirus B19. For HIV-1, HBV, and HCV, the analytic sensitivity quoted is that of the assay itself without taking sample dilutions or pooling into account (Schreiber et al. 79 ). Operational sensitivity takes these dilutions into account and refers to the maximum quantity that could be present in the contaminated donor unit. For parvovirus, Omrix's acceptance requirement for a pool of 512 units is less than 10,000 geq per mL, and thus for operational sensitivity we used 10,000",

For vCJD, we assumed 30 ID per mL in a contaminated unit. \u00b6 For HIV and HCV, the infectious load is considered to be equivalent to the viral load expressed in geq or copies, given that we are restricting consideration to the acute preseroconversion viremic phase, which is known to be highly infectious (see text), and that seropositive units from other donors, which might contain neutralizing antibodies, have been detected by serologic screening and excluded from the manufacturing pools. For HBV, we similarly assume high-level infectivity of window-phase donations 35, 85 but reduce this to a ratio of 1 in 10, in part, because of the likely presence of anti-HBsAg in the plasma pool. We used a ratio of 1:1000 for HAV and parvovirus. We believe this to be justified since the neutralization capacity of anti-HAV is well established. While the ratio of infectious units to geq for parvovirus is unknown, results from tissue culture infectivity studies indicate that the ratio is 1:5000 for genotype 1 and 1:260,000 for genotype 2 86 for products devoid of parvovirus antibody, the lowest ID that has been reported on infusion into a seronegative recipient is 2 \u00a5 10 4 geq, 70 and the infectivity of products containing parvovirus antibody has been shown to be reduced considerably. 83, 87, 88 maximum genomic load likely to be present in a fractionation pool (Table 1, Column 7) . This was adjusted downward for HBV, HAV, and parvovirus B19 to account for the reduced infectivity of virus that occurs as a result of neutralizing antibodies derived from other donors in the pool, since antibody screening is not performed for these prevalent agents. No adjustment was applied to HIV or HCV since later-stage infections with potential neutralizing antibodies are interdicted by the currently deployed serologic tests. Although attempts to transmit vCJD by human plasma have failed, 44 epidemiologic evidence supports its transmission by whole blood and blood components. [45] [46] [47] Based on animal models, its concentration is likely to be quite low, estimated at 20 to 30 IDs per mL. 48 With the use of this estimate, the maximum concentration in the plasma pool approximates 0.003 IDs per mL (3 IDs/L), and the total maximum load in a 6000-L plasma pool will approximate 10 4.3 IDs (Table 1 ).",

Thus, viral elimination studies typically use HIV, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV; model for HCV), pseudorabies virus (PRV; model for HBV), HAV or another picornovirus such as encephalomyocarditis virus, and canine parvovirus (or another model for human parvovirus B19).",

The clearance factors for enveloped viruses and the models for HIV, HCV, and HBV exceed the challenge dose for each of the dedicated viral elimination steps (i.e., S/D, pasteurization, nanofiltration, and vapor heating). Consequently, when the same virus has been studied in each of the two dedicated steps, the validated clearance factors exceed 9 log, and where higher doses of virus have been used or more steps validated, clearance factors as large as 18 log have been reported. The validated clearance of nonenveloped viruses is significantly less than for enveloped viruses since only one of the two dedicated viral elimination methods is effective against these viruses. Parvoviruses are a special case since they are especially heatstable, and only 1 to 2 log of animal parvoviruses are inactivated by either pasteurization or vapor heating. It should be noted, however, that human parvovirus B19 may be more heat-sensitive than the models used here. 49 Nanofiltration is significantly more effective, and Omrix has shown for its thrombin preparation that nanofiltration removes approximately 6 log of parvoviruses.",

            "text": "A more complete estimate of safety margin needs to take into account the contribution of the other steps in the process that contribute to safety despite not being formally validated. It is commonly accepted that immune neutralization contributes to HAV and parvovirus B19 safety and that the neutralization capacity of antibodies to these viruses is at least 3 to 4 log. 50 Since fibrinogen is purified by simple precipitations, it, like intermediatepurity FVIII preparations, likely benefits from the copresence of antibody in the final preparation. 51 Ion-exchange chromatography typically removes 2 to 3 log of virus. [52] [53] [54] [55] Finally, some contribution to the calculation of safety margins should be ascribed to the \"reserve capacity\" of the viral inactivation method(s) employed, defined as the ability to achieve complete virus kill in a fraction of the treatment time allotted. While numerous publications make clear that linear extrapolation of virus inactivation curves overstates inactivation potential, 56, 57 assigning no benefit to reserve capacity when calculating safety margins clearly underestimates inactivation capacity. Unless data indicate otherwise, we propose adopting the scheme described in Table 5 . Although seemingly arbitrary, this scheme has the value of simplicity. Its use is supported by the dozens if not hundreds of times results with S/D and heat treatment methods have been reproduced, thereby increasing the quantity of virus subjected to challenge. Also, for S/D treatment methods, viral kill has been shown to be complete even when using tri-(n-butyl)phosphate (TNBP) together with sodium cholate, a combination that provides far slower kill kinetics than the more frequently employed TNBP-Tween 80 or TNBP-Triton X-100 combinations (Fig. 2) , and the fact that reagent concentration can be halved without affecting viral kill (data not shown). We have not made reserve capacity estimates for vapor heating since much of the loss in viral infectivity occurs before initiation of the heat cycle (Fig. 3 ). Taking these factors into account, along with published information on the inactivation of HIV, HCV, and HBV, 58 for fibrinogen, we estimate that 15 to 17 log of enveloped viruses, 10 to 11.5 log of HAV or most other nonenveloped viruses, and 7 log of parvovirus are eliminated. For thrombin, we estimate that 17 to 22 log of enveloped viruses, 11 to 13 log of HAV, and 7 to 10 log of parvoviruses are eliminated ( Table 6 ).",

As a consequence, when new threats from enveloped viruses (e.g., WNV, pandemic influenza, and dengue viruses) are identified, the procedures in place for manu-factured blood products are sufficient to ensure safety. This contrasts with the record of so-called labile blood components that have been shown to transmit, for example, WNV, at least until new screening tests are developed and deployed. From a patient safety perspective, it is also important to note that the safety margins for fibrin sealant and thrombin exceed those for labile blood components by many orders of magnitude. This is a direct consequence of the multiple improvements adopted by manufacturers of purified blood products over the past 20 years including deploying robust methods of virus inactivation.",

Beginning around 2001, commercial manufacturers of plasma products began employing NAT to screen incoming plasma units in a minipool format to limit viral loads. Originally, testing was performed to ensure that titers did not exceed 10 5 geq per mL; for Omrix's and Baxter's fibrin sealant products, a standard of not more than 10 4 geq per mL has been adopted for the minipool being tested. A recent article by Geng et al. 51 confirms the benefits of screening incoming plasma for parvovirus B19 by NAT. Despite this improvement, the maximum load of infectious virus that might be present remains considerable, and it would appear that the fibrinogen component might still transmit parvovirus B19, albeit at very low frequency. Clinical studies will be required to confirm this since the antibody content of fibrinogen might provide adequate protection, or parvovirus B19 might be more sensitive to heat treatment than the animal parvovirus models used, as has been suggested. 74 The greater safety margin calculated for the thrombin component arises from the use of more vigorous purification procedures and the overall effectiveness of nanofilters in removing parvovirus. Because of its size and shape, fibrinogen cannot be nanofiltered successfully.",

Safety may result from the geographic restrictions that have been instituted to eliminate individuals who are at high risk of exposure, the very low levels in blood, and its removal by steps in common use including precipitations, filtrations, and column chromatography. If a vCJD contaminated unit was included in the plasma pool, the calculated safety margin for fibrinogen and thrombin is very high. Unlike viruses used in spiking studies, however, the structure of the causative agent of vCJD is unknown and may differ significantly from the models in use. Because of this uncertainty and the devastating nature of the disease, the authorities in the United Kingdom have concluded that recipients of plasma-derived FVIII, F IX, and antithrombin prepared using donations from individuals who subsequently developed vCJD should be told that they may be at increased risk for developing the disease. 75 This emphasizes the importance of donor exclusion criteria implemented for all products licensed in the United States or Europe. With these exclusions taken into account, the risk for vialed product should remain well less than 1 in 1 million for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 1 trillion for thrombin. Finally, we should comment about the methods employed in making these calculations. In addition to the validated studies presented to the FDA and other regulatory agencies, we examined other steps in the manufacturing process that were likely to contribute to safety together with published information from other related processes. We also have taken into account the benefit of using viral inactivation methods that have a large reserve capacity. Our intent in employing this approach was not to replace the stricter approach taken by regulatory authorities, but simply to more completely assess safety. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that our calculations are estimates and actual findings may differ. Acknowledging these shortcomings but based on our calculations, we encourage manufacturers and other interested parties to continue seeking ways to enlarge the safety margin, especially for nonenveloped viruses and to address the theoretical risk posed by vCJD by plasma collected prior to detectable viremia, and infectivity of ramp-up versus chronic stages.
