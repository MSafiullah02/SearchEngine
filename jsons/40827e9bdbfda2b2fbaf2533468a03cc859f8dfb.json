The novel coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 from the wet seafood market [3] . COVID-19 was regarded as a public health emergency of international concern in the world by mid-February 2019 [4] . The epicentre of the pandemic shifted from Europe to USA from time to time and at present there are around 17.8 lakhs cases of COVID-19 with 109,275 casualties in the world, amounting to 6.12% mortality rate according to World Health Organization (WHO) as of now. The number of cases and deaths are increasing day by day and the infection is spreading to almost every corner of this world.",

On 25th March 2020, Prime minister of India announced a nationwide 3-week lockdown to prevent community transmission in India. This lockdown has been extended further and we have no idea when this lockdown gets released. Even after the release of lockdown, the situation will not be the same as in the past and we have to be more careful in attending patients.",

If possible, get portable X-rays and ultrasound to avoid contamination of the radiology area and it also helps in decreasing movement of COVID patients. For investigations like CT scan or MRI, we have to sterilize the respective area after investigating every patient as per centres for disease control and prevention guidelines [7, 8] . Patients with closed fractures should wait for surgical interventions until the COVID-19 results are out. All cases which need urgent management like an open fracture, vascular injuries, compartment syndrome or mangled limb; we cannot wait until COVID results. These patients should be managed as COVID positive patients and strict precautions should be taken to avoid transmission to caregivers or to other patients. If the results are positive keep the patient in the COVID isolation ward until the results are negative and take the help of the COVID response team of the hospital. If the results are negative shift the patient to the orthopaedic ward and then discharge as early as possible.",

Low-and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia require a standard protocol that can be followed throughout the country with minimum resources available to ease burden over the health care system. There are no guidelines published in the past. Hence, this article can be valuable for the development of a standard universal guidelines for management these emergencies. The patient attendees should also be screened for the risk factors and number of visitors to be restricted. Contact tracing can also be done with the help of these visitors.

They are not allowed to attend other patients and remain segregated from the other department colleagues. We need to have 2-3 such teams who work according to shifts.
