Microbiological studies that rely on culture\u2010based techniques underestimate the diversity of species present10 and offer limited detection of intracellular pathogens. The application of culture\u2010independent approaches offers the opportunity to both provide a broader picture of tracheal microbiome composition and identify discrete pathogenic species associated with disease states.",

Our unbiased molecular interrogation of the tracheal microbiota of iSGS patients provides detailed nucleic acid, protein, and immunologic evidence to demonstrate Mycobacterium species within tracheal scar. Together with our previous work, these studies offer new insights into the pathogenesis of iSGS. They suggest that human tracheal mucosal health is highly dependent on the composition of the resident microbiota, identify a novel pathogenic role for established large airway bacteria, and offer targets for future therapeutic interventions.",
