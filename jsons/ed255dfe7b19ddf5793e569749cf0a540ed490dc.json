In the case of mobile apps, this methodology is often combined with Bluetooth or GPS solutions. The common structure of these surveys starts by asking for some personal information: generally gender, age range and location (the level of detail depends on each survey and country, going from the name of the city, to the zip code or even the street name), but could also be extended to professional sector, level of income and others. Next, a series of questions are asked to reveal possible COVID-19 symptoms. All this information is collected and analysed in order to study the evolution of the pandemic and identify those areas where it was more present than in others, and ultimately to help governments and health authorities to take decisions. Many of these surveys were initially published as Google forms, which presents some controversies from an ethical perspective: there was a lack of privacy statement, informed consent, the purpose of the investigation or the proper explanation of data storage and processing. Although most of them have tried to correct and improve those issues, there is still a lack of information of how all the previous data has been treated.",

We can find many applications, especially in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) that use BLE technology for communication between different types of devices. The BLE protocol is now being used as the base technology behind proximity contact tracing apps that are being developed as a way to monitor the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic. The characteristics of BLE against other technologies are, first the before-mentioned low power consumption, which allows contact tracing apps to run for hours without shortening mobiles' batteries too fast. Second, BLE works very well as a short-distance tracker and is especially beneficial in indoor environments.",

At the same time, they seek for data minimisation by collecting only anonymous information about infected people and discarding any tracing information from non-infectious individuals. This is used by epidemiologists to build the network of contacted people with a possibility to have been infected, but no other personal or health information. At the same time, this protocol enhances user empowerment by giving them the choice to voluntarily share the information gathered by their mobile devices with health authorities. With these requirements, the DP-3T seeks to follow the General Data Protection Regulation (hereafter: GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive, prioritising the limitation of data usage and storage, as it will be described in Section 3.",

The team led by Carmela Troncoso, Assistant Professor at EPFL, has published the documentation of their protocol 1 with an aim of obtaining feedback from the community.

However, in the last few days, many partners -including KU Leuven -have withdrawn from the PEPP-PT consortium due to the lack of transparency around the protocol. The main criticism being the fact that, in case a user is diagnosed positive to COVID 19, the PEPP-PT's protocol (NTK) preconizes the sending of the observed EphIDs to the backend server while DP-3T's counterpart relies on the infected user's own emitted EphIDs. Similarly, the computation of the risk happens on the backend server in the former case, while it is processed locally in the latter. DP-3T consortium describes the main conflicts that PEPP-PT's protocol presents in terms of privacy and data protection 3 . This is not the only approach that has been used for contact tracing apps. In Singapore, the government has developed BlueTrace, an open source protocol used in the TraceTogether PPPT app, which is also based on Bluetooth. The methodology is very similar: every time a mobile phone detects proximity with another device that is also using the app, it will that information store locally and share it with the health authorities. The main difference with the European initiatives is the encryption method but both seek for being as less invasive as possible. Apple and Google have also started a joint initiative to design their own protocol which is based on DP-3T, which will be directly installed as a feature of their respective operating systems iOS and Android.",

            "text": "GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite-based radionavigation system which is operated by the United States Space Forces. Usually, modern mobile phones incorporate a special type of GPS, i.e. the Assisted Global Positioning System (AGPS), which improves the performance of a stand-alone GPS by leveraging the wireless network of mobile's operator. GPS uses radio waves between satellites and a receiver inside the mobile phone to provide location and time information to any application that needs to use it (like Google Maps). Geolocalisation services are many and range from emergency calls to tracking, sharing location data with friends and location-based ads. Note that since the AGPS uses the cellular network, the precision of the geolocation data depends on the strength of the signal between the phone and the cell tower. Although new GPS chips promise to pinpoint a device's accuracy to within 30 centimetres (Kastrenakes, 2017) , today's solutions offer typically a range of three to five meters and in certain environments (e.g. underground locations) they may lack precision. For this reason, inside buildings like airports or car parks, indoor positioning systems, based for instance on Bluetooth or a wireless local area network, are preferred. An example of an app using GPS is SOS Italia, where location data are collected only after users' authorization, i.e. activation is not automatic. Also, SOS Italia relies on a digital platform accessible only to authorized persons, responsible for collecting and organizing the information entered in the app directly from citizens, starting with name, surname and personal data on residence and domicile, accompanied by their tax code (Rusconi, 2020) .",

Applied in the present context, this means that the operators of the mobile app must explain, in clear and plain language, the reason(s) why each category of personal data is processed (e.g., in the context of BLE-based contact tracing apps, the emitted EphIDs of a patient diagnosed positive with COVID-19 are sent to the backend server in order for the system to inform, via push notification, the other users of the app that they have been in contact with an infected person). It is crucial that the purpose of the processing of personal data should be limited to fighting the current sanitary crisis, and nothing else. In the same vein, controllers must refrain from using the collected personal data for purposes that are incompatible with contact tracing (e.g., in the context of symptom checker apps, using the answers to the questions to target individuals with personalised ads).

In the case of BLE-based proximity tracing, the institution also recommends using temporary user IDs that change regularly rather than fixed identifiers linked to the user's device. All in all, it should not be possible for the receiving user to re-identify the individuals using the emitted ephemeral identifiers, and vice versa.

In the case of COVID-19, there are no previous data sets nor research focused on this problem, since it is the first time that the humanity is facing it. Also, the effectiveness of tracing apps depends on the number of people using them. For example, a group of researchers at the university of Oxford reported that 80% of UK users of smartphone devices (56% of the population) would need to install and use the app in order to be effective (Hinch et al., 2020) . These numbers are far from being representative of the whole population of a country, taking into account that there are specific groups that will be excluded from the sampled data: older adults and young kids, but also people with low incomes or no access to digital resources. A survey carried by Digimeter 13 showed that 27% of Flemish people aged 65 years and older do not even own a smartphone. Even when sufficient trust can be created for a widespread adoption of the app or if the installation of the app will be obligatory, we still need to keep in mind that a substantial part of population does not own a smartphone. To provide technical robustness, the possible outcomes of such apps and surveys require of vast amount of new information, which should be verified and validated to provide trusted results.

While these and similar initiatives are fundamental to guarantee a safe introduction of tracing apps into society in these unique and exceptional conditions, we argue that privacy by design is not enough. Technical and organisational measures cannot substitute the human effort needed to build a culture of trust among citizens and between citizens and institutions. Safety is not only a matter of a technical or an organisational provision. It is also a condition which reflects a relationship between the ones who expect protection and those who take the responsibility to fulfil this expectation.
