            "text": "Viral respiratory infections cause serious health problems in human populations. Many agents can infect and replicate in the respiratory tract, however, causative agents for 30 percent of respiratory infections remain unidentified [1,2,3], suggesting that not-yet-identified pathogens, including viruses, remain to be discovered. Many of these unknown viruses may be difficult to propagate in culture and for this reason, culture- and sequence-independent metagenomic methods are needed to identify these agents. VIDISCA-454 (virus discovery cDNA-AFLP, amplified fragment-length polymorphism combined with Roche 454 high-throughput sequencing) includes a reverse transcription, second strand synthesis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation to adaptors, PCR amplification, and deep sequencing to generate virus sequences independent of the viral characteristics and its genome composition [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Discovery of unknown pathogens in respiratory samples can be complicated by high concentrations of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which competes for sequence space, reducing the number of reads that originate from viruses [11]. Furthermore, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease, or even an infection, can be a challenge. In particular, new viruses have been identified in human respiratory samples by sensitive deep sequencing techniques, but a clear association of a new virus with a disease requires further detailed investigations (e.g., torque teno mini virus and gamma human papillomavirus are not yet established as human pathogens [6,12,13]). Another difficulty is to recognize new viruses among the massive amount of sequence data generated. With most currently used methods, virus identification is dependent on the identity of the new virus to already known virus genomes. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Blast tool searches can identify viruses if a closely related virus is present in GenBank, but highly divergent virus sequences may remain unrecognized.",

            "text": "To overcome these limitations in virus discovery, we recently developed a modification of the VIDISCA-454 method by adding an antibody capture step. This method uses host antibodies elicited by an infection, obtained from convalescent serum one month after the respiratory illness. These antibodies are used to enrich the causative viral agent from the respiratory material that was collected during the acute phase of the infection. The advantage of the antibody capture approach is multi-fold: (1) it decreases the background rRNA increasing the relative percentage of virus sequence reads (2) it identifies viruses that induced an immune response in the patient, which increases the chance to find a pathogenic virus; and (3) it allows the identification of new viruses that have very low identity to known viruses [14]. In this study we identified a new type of rhinovirus C with this novel antibody capture VIDISCA-454 method.",

            "text": "Rhinoviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7200 nt. Their genome encodes a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved into four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D) [15]. VP1-4 form the capsid that surrounds the RNA genome, while the remaining nonstructural proteins are involved in viral genome replication and virion assembly [16]. Rhinoviruses belong to the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family [17] and three species are known: RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C [17]. Rhinoviruses were first discovered in the 1950s and have been linked to the majority of upper respiratory tract infections in humans. Furthermore, RV-C infection is found in about half of all rhinovirus infections in young children [18]. Despite being highly prevalent, RV-Cs are however difficult to culture, with replication reported on commercial 3D human upper airway epithelia [19], sinus mucosal organ culture [18], human primary bronchial [20], and sinus epithelial cells [21]. According to the latest classification, 53 Rhinovirus C types have been identified thus far [22] with the novel virus identified here named RV-C54 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Picornaviridae Study Group [22].",

Subsequently, nucleic acids were extracted by the Boom extraction method [25], with elution in sterile water containing rRNA-blocking oligonucleotides to prevent amplification of rRNA [9]. The nucleic acids from the input original samples (\u201cinput\u201d) and nucleic acids from the captured material (\u201cenriched\u201d) were reverse transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II (Invitrogen) using non-ribosomal random hexamers [26]. Second strand DNA synthesis was performed with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and double-stranded DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The double stranded DNA was digested with MseI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Adaptors were ligated to the digested fragments followed by a size-selection purification to reduce the amplification of DNA fragments smaller than 200 bp using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, MA, USA). A 28-cycle PCR with adaptor-binding primers was executed, combined with a purification of the PCR products (Agencourt AMPure XP PCR, Beckman Coulter, MA, USA) to remove excess primers and short PCR-fragments. The DNA concentration was determined with the Quant-it dsDNA HS Qubit kit (Invitrogen) and the KAPA Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Subsequently, the Bioanalyser (hsDNA chip, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to determine the average nucleotide length of the library which was diluted until 106 copies/\u00b5L, clonally amplified in an emulsion PCR according to the suppliers\u2019 protocol (LIB-A SV emPCR kit, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and sequenced on a GS FLX Titanium PicoTiterPlate (70 \u00d7 75) with the GS FLX Titanium XLR 70 Sequencing kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).

The Xcompare2 script creates a custom BLAST nucleotide database [27] comprised of all reads within the input dataset, and subsequently identifies identical or near-identical sequences (based on sequence identity) within the same input dataset by performing a stringent BLASTN search (Dust filter disabled, E-value: 3E-60, word size: 11, match/mismatch scores 1/\u22122, gap existence/extension penalty: 5/2) with this database utilizing the input sequences as a query. These BLAST results are used to construct a new library, containing both unique read sequences and consensus sequences of reads found multiple times (aligned with MUSCLE (Version 3.8.31, 2013) [28,29] with the following settings: maximum number of iterations: 1; diagonal optimization enabled, and metadata on sequence abundance). This library is converted into a second custom BLAST database (flat database) to which sequences from the enriched dataset are compared using BLASTN (Dust filter disabled, E-value: 3E-60, word size: 11, match/mismatch scores 1/\u22122, gap existence/extension penalty: 5/2). The results obtained from the second stage BLAST analysis are used to identify sequences, which are either unique or more frequently detected in one of the two datasets (input or enriched). For every sequence present in both the input and enriched dataset the Enrichment Index is calculated as the ratio between the percentage of sequence space occupied by each unique sequence in the input dataset (number of reads in the input library matching the unique sequence divided by the total number of reads of the library) and the enriched dataset (number of reads in the enriched library after antibody capturing matching the unique sequence divided by the total number of reads of the library). Sequences which are observed solely in either the input or the enriched datasets are automatically flagged and stored separately for manual inspection. In this study all sequences with an Enrichment Index higher than 1.0 and sequences identified only in the enriched sequence set, were extracted and further analyzed.",

The full-length genome was 7054 nt in size, with a single large ORF of 6447 nt. The base composition of the RNA genome is rich in A (31.5%) and U (25.2%) and relatively poor in G (22.0%) and C (21.3%), a property similar to other rhinoviruses [40]. The single large ORF runs from nucleotide position 608 to 7054 preceded by a 5' untranslated region (UTR). The ORF encodes a polyprotein of 2148 amino acids, which in analogy to other rhinoviruses is probably cleaved by virally encoded proteases (2A and 3C) to yield 11 proteins. Proteinase cleavage sites on the polyprotein were predicted by the NetPicoRNA program [35] and potential cleavage sites are listed in Table 1. At the VP4/VP2 junction there is the Met 67/Ser 68 cleavage site, similar to what has been described for other RV-Cs [41].

This strong secondary structure is followed by a spacer tract (88-GCUAUCCCCCCCAACUUAUGUAAU-107, [42]) and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The IRES length is 498 nt (109\u2013606) and forms an unbranched stem in the 3' part of the predicted RNA structure. As has been shown for other rhinoviruses, in the new type of RV-C the last AUG of the IRES and the open reading frame AUG create a variably pair (Figure 1B), facilitating ribosome entry in a specific mechanism known for rhinoviruses [42]. Within the VP4/VP2 gene of RV-Cs, there is a cis-acting regulatory element (CRE), and in the RV-C54 this CRE is located between nucleic acid positions 220\u2013267 (Figure 1C).",

The closest relatives based on the VP4/VP2 sequences of strains that are completely typed are RV-C45 and RV-C29 with 85.0% and 84.8% identity, respectively. However, there are eleven additional strains of which only the VP4/VP2 sequences are available in GenBank. These strains are awaiting type assignments when their complete genome or VP1 sequences have been determined. The VP4/VP2 sequence of RV-C54 has close identity with one of these unassigned strains (95% at nt level: rhinovirus isolate RV1039 (EU752398.1), see Figure 3).

We have previously shown that the method facilitates virus identification by enriching viral material with convalescent autologous patient antibodies prior to deep sequencing [14]. The requirement that an agent is recognized by the patient\u2019s antibodies adds an important selection for immunogenic viruses [14]. The discovery of a new rhinovirus type by the antibody capture technique demonstrates that the method can be used on clinical samples and that it has good potential to identify novel immunogenic and likely pathogenic viruses. Although the immunogenicity of rhinoviruses is known, in case of a completely new virus for which no prior data is available, the antibody capture gives a strong indication of infectivity in human cells and immunogenicity. The enrichment index can be used to exclude non-immunogenic viruses or viruses from other sources, including ingredients used in sample preparation or contaminants of the sample.",

According to the most recent proposal for classification of rhinoviruses, a threshold of 13% divergence for VP1 nucleotide sequences is used for type assignment of RV-A and RV-C [17], and 12% divergence at the nucleotide level of RV-B VP1 [17]. Since RV-C54 virus has 19% divergence in the VP1 region, the virus is classified as a new type [22].",
