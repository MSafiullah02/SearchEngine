IB poses a major economic threat to the poultry industry worldwide because of poor weight gain and lost feeding efficiency in broilers, and reduced egg numbers and quality in egg-laying birds (Jackwood, 2012, Xu et al., 2007, Yu et al., 2001). The typical symptoms of IB include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and tracheal rales (Cavanagh, 2007, Yan et al., 2016). Despite a predilection towards the respiratory tract, IBV also displays kidney and oviduct tropisms, thereby causing urogenital problems (Naqi et al., 2003, Zhong et al., 2016).",

The IBV genome contains at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) as follows: 5\u2032-1a-1b-S1/S2-3a-3b-3c (E)-M-5a-5b-N-poly (A) \u22123\u2032 (Xu et al., 2016). Approximately two-thirds of the genome encodes non-structural proteins (nsps) including the overlapping ORFs 1a and 1b, which are translated as the large polyprotein, 1ab. Protein 1ab is associated with RNA replication and transcription and can be further cleaved into 15 nsps (Zhao et al., 2014). The remaining 3\u2032-end one-third of the genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Zhao et al., 2016). The S1 subunit of the spike protein is a major inducer of protective antibodies and is closely associated with viral tissue tropism and immune protection. The C-terminal portion of the S2 protein is intercalated in the virus envelope and assists S1 protein anchoring in the membrane (Li et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2016). The N protein is associated with the RNA genome and forms the ribonucleoprotein (Cavanagh, 2007).",

IBV immunity is serotype-specific, and Mass-type vaccines (H120) can be ineffective against infection with different IBV isolates in China (Chen et al., 2017, Sun et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2015). Therefore, the continuous testing of pathogenicity in new isolates, epidemic serotype determination, and typing new IBV strains remains crucial for better epidemiological understanding and control of IB in regions and/or countries.",

The Massachusetts serotype was believed to be the only serotype until a second (Connecticut) was identified in the mid-1950s (Keeler et al., 1998). However, in recent years, a large number of IBV serotypes, antigenic variants, and field strains have been isolated (Xu et al., 2016). A previous study has shown that the incidence of the QX-like genotype increased from 11.7% to nearly 70% in China over a 20-year period from 1994, whereas the vaccine-like genotype, including the common vaccine strains (such as Mass 41, H120, and Connecticut), declined from 50.4% to 4.4% (Zhao et al., 2016). Concurrently, the QX-like IBV-type was found to cause renal, respiratory and reproductive lesions in chicken flocks in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East (Mo et al., 2013, Valastro et al., 2010, Worthington and Jones, 2006, Worthington et al., 2008). The emergence of many QX-like IBVs is a major problem in the poultry industry. We have previously isolated two wild IBV strains, called \u201cSZ\u201d and \u201cSD\u201d, and a primary phylogenetic analysis showed that they belong to the QX-like genotype. Therefore, we performed a series of experiments to investigate their molecular characteristics and identify the pathogenicity and antigenicity of QX-like IBVs for better understanding of them with the aim of improved disease control.",

The SZ IBV strain was isolated in 2012 from IB-affected chickens in the Jiangsu Province of China, which exhibited signs of respiratory (coughing and sneezing). Other viruses, including two vaccine strains (M41 and 4/91), and two wild-type virulent strains (YN and GD), were used for virus cross neutralization tests in this study. The M41 and 4/91 strains belong to genotype Mass-type and 4/91-like, respectively. The YN strain (GenBank accession no: JF893452) is a YN-type originating from a H120 vaccinated broiler flock with a death rate of 30% in the Yunnan Province of China (Xu et al., 2016, Zhao et al., 2015). The GD strain was isolated from IB-affected chickens in the Guangdong Province of China, and is closely related to the TW-type according to phylogenetic analysis (Xu et al., 2016). All IBVs used in this study were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs via the allantoic route and the infectious allantoic fluid was collected at 40 h post-inoculation. The median embryo infectious doses (EID50) for these strains were calculated using the standard method (Reed and Muench, 1938).",

Briefly, all sera were inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, and then diluted ten-fold or serially two-fold and incubated with the same volume of 100 EID50 of the IBV strains at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The virus-serum mixtures were then inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos. Six days afterwards, the embryos were examined for the lesions typical of IBV infection (embryo dwarfing). The neutralizing titer of each serum sample against these viruses was determined and calculated by the Reed and Muench method (1938). A negative serum sample was always included in this study. The cross-neutralization R-values for the strains were calculated by the method described by Archetti and Horsfall (1950). Antigenic (serotype) difference between two given strains was defined as follows: an R value higher than 70% indicated antigenic identity between the two tested viruses, an R value between 33% and 70% indicated a minor subtype difference, an R value between 11% and 32% indicated a major subtype difference, and an R value below 11% indicated different serotypes.",

The SZ QX-like strain, along with 4/91, M41, YN, SD and GD, which all represent different serotypes, showed different levels of cross-neutralization. Isolate SZ conferred poor cross neutralization to Mass-like M41 (R = 8.1%) or to YN-like YN (R = 6.9%), indicating that the strains belonged to different serotypes. The R-values for 4/91 (R = 14.6%) and GD (R = 16.7%) obtained in this study were below 32%, indicating that the strains belong to a different major subtype. Notably, the results showed that the antisera against SD used in this study could completely neutralize the SZ IBV isolate (R = 91.1%), a finding consistent with them belonging to the same serotype.",

The QX-like genotype was first isolated in 1998 in China, and it was considered to have a different genotype to all of the other IBVs (Li et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2014). However, some studies have suggested that there is an uncertain correlation between its genotype and serotype (Chen et al., 2015). Therefore, accurate characterization of QX-like strains is an essential prerequisite for control measure implementation, and for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of IBVs. In this study, genotype, serotype and pathogenicity analyses of the QX-like strains SD and SZ were conducted.",

Consistent with previous reports is that the IBV serotype is associated with HVR 1 in the N-terminus (residues 45\u2013114) of the S1 gene (Wang and Huang, 2000). The results of the cross-neutralization tests are in accordance with the phylogenetic analyses, which showed that the serotype of strains SD and SZ are obviously very different from those of the four selected serotypes (YN-like, TW-like, 4/91-like and Mass-like) investigated in this study.",

            "text": "The pathogenicity test indicated that inoculation of SPF chickens with the SD strain resulted in clinical signs consistent with an IB-like disease, and respiratory signs in the birds were most apparent. The mortality rate of the SD strain was higher (reaching 67%) than that reported previously (Gallardo et al., 2012) suggesting it is a highly pathogenic strain. The SD strain caused obviously swollen and pale kidneys, with ureters distended with urate. Lesions caused by the SD strain were similar to those described in previous reports, which have characterized it as a nephropathogenic IBV strain (Cong et al., 2013, Feng et al., 2012, Yan et al., 2016). However, we found that obvious clinical signs and lesions were not observed after the 3-week-old SPF chicks were inoculated with 105.0EID50 of SZ. Also, the SZ group, when compared with the SD group, presented with mild histopathological changes in the trachea, lungs, spleen, glandular stomach, kidneys, and bursa of Fabricius. These findings confirm the lower virulence of SZ compared with SD in 3-week-old-SPF chicks. But analysis of the degree of sequence homology among the strains showed that SD shared high identity with SZ strains. As we know, the pathogenicity of IBV is determined by multiple factors, which may involve its tissue tropism, replication efficacy and its ability to deal with the host\u2019s immune system. The spike protein was shown to be an important virulence determination of IBV and some other protein genes have also been shown to exhibit obvious influence to IBV virulence (Armesto et al., 2009, Casais et al., 2003, Quinteros et al., 2015, Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). So the specific amino acids differences between them in the spike protein possibly contributed to the difference in the two viruses (SD and SZ). Alternatively, some of the distinct amino acid sites in the other structural proteins may have a positive influence on the pathogenicity of the two strains. There are 1 and 0 different amino acid sites in E and M proteins, respectively, suggesting that these proteins may not be directly linked with virulence, as has been suggested earlier (Neuman, 2011, Sapats and Wright, 1996). Clearly, more studies are needed to explore the function of these amino acids.",
