This information is highly pertinent to health care practitioners collecting clinical samples and reinforces We surmise human cellular control testing has an adjunctive role in ensuring quality sampling and test accuracy. Though the control does not fully ensure the sample is correctly taken, it is instructive and reassuring to those collecting samples. Most importantly, we evidence a reduction in the possibility of false-negative results and the inherent potential for ongoing harm that could result. 3 We are also pleased to acknowledge that only a minority of our samples were cellular control failures meaning poor sampling is uncommon in our population. If generalisable, our findings indicate poor sampling is not a major contributor towards the high numbers of false negative results reported. 4 We would like to commend and encourage the continued good practice of frontline staff.

Poorly taken clinical samples can result in false negative tests resulting in misinformed decisions. To address this, we at the Public Health England laboratory in Manchester have used beta-2-microglobulin as a marker of human cellular control alongside COVID-19 testing (RpRd gene; Roche FLOW system). 2 Samples failing the control and testing negative for COVID-19 were reported as inadequate thereby ensuring samples with no human tissue present were not reported as true negatives. From 11/02/2020, 15,485 respiratory tract samples have been tested (figure 1). A total of 241 (1.6%) samples were human cellular control failures, all of these were swabs of the upper respiratory tract.",
