In the field of surgical oncology, some elective operations have been postponed, and non-essential outpatient clinic visits are deferred pending control of the pandemic in the United Kingdom and most likely also in other parts of the world1. When the pandemic will be declared over and whether further episodes will return remain unknown. As with every crisis, this situation brings opportunities for reflection and improvement. Thus, considering the technological advances available, surgical oncologists might want to review their mindset and reconsider how they manage certain cancers during this pandemic and beyond.",

Patients with symptoms suggestive of cancer might initially defer seeking the opinion of a specialist or be asked to defer procedures deemed \u2018non-essential\u2019, such as mammograms, colonoscopies or surgery2. Substantial delays in diagnosis and treatment of any cancer would invariably result in poorer oncological outcomes. Patients with early stage cancers needing surgery could be found to have advanced-stage or metastatic disease when surgery is eventually performed.

With careful selection and timely delivery, surgery is potentially curative in 30\u201340% of patients with resectable colorectal cancer.

We propose several solutions learnt from our experience as gastrointestinal cancer surgeons, which can be applied to the surgical management of other malignancies (Fig. 1). Upon a cancer diagnosis (for example, any gastrointestinal cancer on endoscopy), patients should ideally be referred to \u2018clean\u2019 health-care facilities, away from hospitals delivering acute care, to undergo staging scans and any necessary blood tests. With the burgeoning of teleconferencing, pre-operative consultations can be performed with the patient in their own home3. In our experience, these consultations can incorporate consent taking, counselling for enhanced recovery after surgery, pre-rehabilitation therapy and even stoma education. Bowel-preparation medications and dietetic supplements can be delivered or purchased from a local neighbourhood pharmacy. In Singapore, some anaesthetists have also begun to conduct their pre-operative assessment via teleconferencing with selected patients. In these situations, patients would potentially only need to arrive at the hospital on the day of the operation. Last-minute preparation, such as stoma marking, could be performed just before the surgery.",

In the case of elective gastrointestinal cancer surgeries, a minimally invasive approach is being increasingly adopted (see Related links). This approach has been associated with objective benefits in large-cohort randomized clinical trials and recommended widely (see Related links); however, these trials also indicate that patients who undergo open surgery would not be unduly disadvantaged. If concern exists regarding the considered risk of infected pressurised droplets at laparoscopy, deferring laparoscopy to ensure the safety of theatre staff would be sensible during pandemics, especially in areas with high incidence of COVID-195. When successfully performed, patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures, preferably with smoke filtration system during this pandemic, often recover quickly; thus, to free up precious hospital resources, selected patients can be transferred to nearby hotels or even to the comfort of their own homes after the first post-operative day with continuous monitoring of the vital signs, which is now feasible with certain wearable devices6. A dedicated team of health-care professionals could conduct regular home visits or telehealth consultations to ensure that recovery is uneventful.",

That said, there are serious potential pitfalls to abandoning some of the long-held traditions, particularly the human contact and face-to-face interaction between the surgeon who is going to undertake a potentially life-threatening procedure and a patient entrusting themselves to that procedure. In a long lifetime of performing high-risk complex surgery, we have always felt that proper communication in its broadest sense and fully informed consent from patients and their relatives are best delivered in person. Our personal experiences have shown us that this approach minimizes dissatisfaction, complaints and litigation. Litigation as a result of poor communication derived from forced isolation during this pandemic could be problematic, and careful safeguards must be implemented.
