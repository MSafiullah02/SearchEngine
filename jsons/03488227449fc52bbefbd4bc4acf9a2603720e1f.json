Only M and N genes were analyzed in strain KU-2 and strain 79-1683, which still had unknown nucleotide sequences. Deduced amino acid sequences of S, M and N proteins were compared in a total of 7 strains of coronaviruses, which included FIPV type II strain 79-1146, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain Insavc-1 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) strain Purdue. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of M and N proteins revealed that both M and N proteins had an identity of at least 90% between FIPV type I and type II. The phylogenetic tree of the M and N protein-deduced amino acid sequences showed that FIPV type I and type II form a group with FECV type II, and that these viruses were evolutionarily distant from CCV and TGEV. On the other hand, when the S protein-deduced amino acid sequences was compared, identity of only about 45% was found between FIPV type I and type II. The phylogenetic tree of the S protein-deduced amino acid sequences indicated that three strains of FIPV type I form a group, and that it is a very long distance from the FIPV type II, FECV type II, CCV and TGEV groups.",

The second group contains avian infectious bronchitis virus. The third group consists of human respiratory coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus (CCV), FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). By using monoclonal antibodies we have shown the existence of at least 2 sero-types of FIPV, and the antigenicity of type II strain of FIPV and FECV were closer to TGEV and CCV than to type I FIPV (7, 8) . Both types I and II FIPV cause infectious peritonitis in cats, and the pathogenicity of type II FIPV is greater than that of type I FIPV (25) . However, in the field, the prevalence of FIPV type I is high, and about 70% of feline cases of FIP are due to infection with type I (9) .",

(kb) long and the three major structural protein genes are located in the 3' half of the genome (4). The complete nucleotide sequences of these genes have been established with FIPV type II strain 79-1146 (3, 5, 31) and several other serologically related coronaviruses, such as TGEV and CCV (10, (12) (13) (14) 26) . With regard to FECV strain 79-1683, the sequences of the peplomer (S) gene and 3' end 1-kb gene have been reported (32, 33) . Wesseling et al (33) have determined, from the phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the S protein-deduced amino acid sequences, that 2 strains of CCV (strain Insavc-1 and strain K378) are evolutionarily more closely related to FIPV strain 79-1146 and FECV strain 79-1683 than TGEV. We have recently determined the nucleotide sequence of the S gene of strain KU-2 classified as type I, and compared it with that of FIPV type II strain 79-1146, CCV strain Insavc-1 and TGEV strain Purdue (17) . Deduced amino acid sequences of S protein showed identities of 90.9%\u00a9 and 80.9% between FIPV type II and CCV and between FIPV type II and TGEV, respectively. However, deduced amino acid sequences of S protein showed identity of only 45.9% between FIPV type II and FIPV type I. These findings supported the results of our study on antigenic relationships among feline, porcine and canine coronaviruses with monoclonal antibodies (7, 8) . However, it is not clear whether a similar pattern would be obtained by phylogenic analysis by comparison of integral membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes or whether other strains of FIPV type I would be differentiated from the groups in a way similar to that for KU-2.

Some studies have shown that S protein amino acid sequences of FIPV type II, FECV strain 79-1683, CCV and TGEV have identity of about 75% or more (10, 33) . However, we have recently reported that the S protein amino acid sequence of FIPV type I strain KU-2 has only about 45% identity with FIPV type II, CCV and TGEV (17) . In the present study, S proteins of FIPV type I strain UCD1 and strain Black showed results similar to those of strain KU-2. The phylogenetic tree prepared from the deduced amino acid sequence of S protein showed that three strains of FIPV type I were a very long evolutionary distance from FIPV type II, FECV strain, 79-1683, CCV and TGEV groups. However, the phylogenetic tree newly prepared from the M and N proteins showed a pattern which differed from that of the S protein; the phylogenetic tree of the M and N proteins FIPV type I and type II can be said to belong to the same group of viruses in that both induce FIP. In addition, the length of the open reading frame (ORF) 6b of FIPV type I was the same as that of FIPV type II ORF 6b (data not shown), and there was not as much deletion as in FECV strain 79-1683 (32) . However, the homology of the deduced amino acid sequence of FIPV type I and type II S proteins was very low, and it was impossible to regard the two virus types as members of the same group from the aspect of nucleotide sequence. S protein plays an important role in neutralization and adsorption to cellular receptors, suggesting that the function of type I is very different from that of type II. The results of our analysis of neutralizing epitopes using monoclonal antibodies support this suggestion (7) . On the other hand, FECV type II strain 79-1683 causes only mild enteritis, and the homology of its S, M and N genes is the highest with FIPV type II. The homology of the S protein amino acid sequence between FIPV type II and FECV strain 79-1683 was higher than that among three strains of FIPV type I. That is, on the basis of pathogenicity, FIPV causing FIP is divided into type I and type II, and another virus, FECV, that does not cause FIP is thought to exist. If pathogenicity is neglected, and nucleotide sequence is considered as the basis, FIPV type II and FECV type II will be included in the same group of viruses. One study has shown that a type I virus strain is present in FECV as well as in FIPV (23) . However, since it is impossible to culture FECV type I in vitro, its study has been delayed. The viruses including this type should be analyzed in the future.",

Does FIPV type II that is currently prevalent throughout the world have such homology? If so, FIPV type II may be a virus with very high conservation of the nucleotide sequence of genomic RNA or it may be a virus that has recently appeared and become prevalent. It has to be shown in the future to what degree FIPV type II strains are different from each other. In the field, FIPV type I is significantly more prevalent than FIPV type II (9) . FIPV type I may be the prototype of FIPV. Some reports have shown that CCV infects cats (15) .
