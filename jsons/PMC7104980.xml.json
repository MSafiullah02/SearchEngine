            "text": "The interest of scientific community to identify and characterize bioactive constituents from various plant extracts for suitable use in pharmaceutical industry or in composition of functional foods is significantly increasing. Today, it is generally accepted that nutrition plays an important role in the prevention of different chronic diseases and decreasing the risk factors by virtue of its functional ingredients. Among the broad category of plant-derived bioactive compounds, flavonoids are found to possess multiple health benefits. Therefore they are being considered as a medicinally important class of dietary molecules (Ravishankar, Rajora, Greco, & Osborn, 2013). These plant-based secondary metabolites are known to represent a number of structurally diverse classes of polyphenols with potential pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-pathogenic properties (Rajendran et al., 2014, Ravishankar et al., 2013). Indeed, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported the ability of flavonoids to interfere in different stages of carcinogenesis like migration, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis (Ravishankar et al., 2013). Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown that long-term and regular consumption of dietary items rich in flavonoids, such as fruits and vegetables, are associated with the lower risk of malignancy developments (Batra and Sharma, 2013, Kozlowska and Szostak-Wegierek, 2014, Tena et al., 2013). The daily intake of flavonoids among humans is still greatly variable, ranging from about twenty milligrams to virtually one gram (Jaramillo-Carmona et al., 2014). Although, flavonoids are characterized by a common skeleton of diphenyl propane, they can be further subdivided into flavanols, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones and anthocyanins based on the peculiarities in their chemical structures (Batra and Sharma, 2013, Kozlowska and Szostak-Wegierek, 2014, Sak, 2014, Tena et al., 2013).",

It has been reported that KMF has potential to significantly modulate a variety of signaling pathways that are involved in many adverse clinico-pathological conditions (Batra and Sharma, 2013, Chen and Chen, 2013, Jaramillo-Carmona et al., 2014, Kim and Choi, 2013, Rajendran et al., 2014). In contrast to the standard chemotherapeutic drugs utilized in cancer treatment at present, KMF showed minimal side effects evidenced in the different experiments along with its effective synergistic ability in combination with various synthetic cytotoxic drugs (Chen and Chen, 2013, Chen et al., 2013, Kim and Choi, 2013, Rajendran et al., 2014). However, essential efforts are still needed to uncover its unexplored health benefits. This review highlights the multiple molecular targets of KMF that are involved in a variety of cellular signaling pathways. In addition to this, the review also discusses synergistic studies of KMF with other known therapeutic drugs along with its pharmacokinetics and epidemiological findings.",

Chalcone has been considered as the most widely studied precursor for a variety of flavanol synthesis. Further, chalcone isomerase mediates isomerisation reactions and leads to the formation of naringenin (flavanone) (4). In the next step, the hydroxylation is known to occur at C3 position of naringenin by flavanone 3-dioxygenase which leads to the synthesis of dihydrokaempferol (5). In the last step, flavonol synthase mediated exordium of a double bond at the C2\u2013C3 position occurs in the dihydrokaempferol skeleton which results in the formation of KMF (Devi et al., 2015) (Fig. 2\n). Naturally, KMF is also known to exist in conjugate forms with different sugar molecules such as rutinose, rhamnose, glucose and galactose that cause the formation of glycosidic combinations of KMF, such as astragalin (kaempferol-3-O-glucoside), kaempferol-3-beta-D-galactoside, kaempferol-3-rutinoside. Besides these, other derivatives, such as kaempferol methyl ether, kaempferol dimethyl ether, kaempferol trimethyl ether and kaempferol sulphate have also been noted (Calderon-Montano et al., 2011, Murakami and Tanaka, 1988).",

Most of these studies demonstrate that the mechanism of KMF is dependent on the inhibition of proliferation of various cancer cells either via cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis (Kuo et al., 2015, Liao et al., 2016). KMF-dependent inhibition of cancer proliferation is mediated through arrest of the different phases of cell cycle (Fig. 4\n) and inhibition of cell cycle transition points including G0/G1 transition in esophagus squamous cell carcinoma (Yao et al., 2016) or G2/M transition in HT-29 human colon cancer cells (Cho, 2013). KMF additionally inhibits the expression of various cyclins like cyclin D1 and cyclin E in breast cancer cells (Kim et al., 2016), cyclin B1 in gastric cancer cells and renal cell carcinoma (Song et al., 2014, Song et al., 2015) cyclin D, cyclin E and cyclin A in colon cancer cells (Cho, 2013) and cyclin-dependent kinases like CDK4 and CDK2 (Cho, 2013). KMF treatment has also been known to up-regulate the CDK inhibitors including p21 and p27 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, results of these studies demonstrate that KMF-dependent arrest of G0/G1 or G2/M transition is possibly due to inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity, hexokinase-2 expression (Yao et al., 2016), inhibition of the activity of estrogen (Kim et al., 2016) or uptake of glucose (Azevedo et al., 2015). Of note, growth factors, hormones, glucose and hexokinases are positive regulators of cell cycle.",

            "text": "A large body of evidence indicates that KMF induces cancer cells apoptosis by activating the apoptosis-related signaling pathways (Fig. 5\n). Xu, Liu, Li, Wu, and Liu (2008) have indicated mitochondria in human cervical cancer cells (Hela cells) and HEK293 cells (embryonic kidney cells) as the source of KMF-dependent activation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling (Xu et al., 2008). Further, studies by Kang et al. (2009) have substantiated that KMF could cause apoptosis MCF-7 breast cancer cells with estrogen receptor (ER) by activating intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway and by down-regulation of PLK1 expression (Kang et al., 2009). Similarly, Song et al. (2015) have shown that in gastric cancer cells KMF decreases the expression level of an anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 on the mitochondrial membrane and concomitant induction of pro-apoptotic protein Bax release from mitochondria (Song et al., 2015). Very recently, by utilizing a number of cancer cell lines, including human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells, human stomach carcinoma (SGC-7901) cells, human cervical carcinoma (Hela) cells and human lung carcinoma (A549) cells Laio et al. have attested that mitochondrial dysfunction is the major reason of KMF-dependent apoptosis induction in these cancer cells (Liao et al., 2016). However, a number of other independent studies claimed that TNF cognate apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is related to KMF-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Of note, the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, and TRAIL are cognate to the activation of extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. For example, Yoshida et al. (2008), have shown that KMF-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines is mediated by inducing TRAIL (Yoshida et al., 2008). Likewise, TRAIL-KMF, mediated apoptosis is the result of suppression of survivin in human glioma cells (Siegelin, Reuss, Habel, Herold-Mende, & von Deimling, 2008). Besides, KMF may also affect and inhibit various pro-survival molecules, i.e. Akt, PI(3)K, ERK 1/2 in the downstream signaling pathways (Kim et al., 2016, Kuo et al., 2015). KMF also suppresses cancer metastasis in osteosarcoma cells (Chen et al., 2013) and induces autophagy (programmed cell survival) in human hepatic cancer cells (Huang et al., 2013). It has been shown that carcinoma cells activate AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent autophagy as the survival response to KMF-mediated energetic impairment (Filomeni et al., 2010). In summary, KMF decreases the number of various cancer cells through a multiprong mechanisms that include the arrest of the cell cycle, activation of proapoptotic proteins, inhibition of antiapoptotic proteins and by attenuating the phosphorylation and activity of prosurvival proteins (e.g. Akt) and activation of programmed cell survival or autophagy.",

            "text": "Cancer cells exhibit high metabolic rate to fulfil their energy requirements that in turn is found to be associated with the neovascularization (angiogenesis). A number of studies have reported the involvement of a variety of transcriptional (ERK 1/2, Akt, and MAPK) and growth factors (VEGF and FGF) in the tumour microenvironment for the neovascularization (Kashyap et al., 2016, Kashyap et al., 2016, Kashyap et al., 2016, Kumar et al., 2016, Tuli et al., 2014). These factors are being targeted as therapeutic approach for the cure of cancer in advanced stages (Fig. 6\n). Treatment of Huh7 cell with KMF under hypoxic (low oxygen tension) condition inhibits the HIF-1\u03b1 protein through the inactivation of p44/42 MAPK pathways which could be possible ways of cancer inhibition (Mylonis, Lakka, Tsakalof, & Simos, 2010). In a study conducted by Luo et al. (2009) using human ovarian cancer cells, they suggested that KMF can inhibit angiogenesis significantly by altering the VEGF expression through both HIF dependent and independent (ESRRA) pathways (Luo et al., 2009). In context to their previous studies Luo et al., 2012a, Luo et al., 2012b, Luo et al., 2012 further proposed a novel angio-prevention mechanism of KMF via down-regulation of ERK-NF\u03baB-cMyc-p21-VEGF signaling pathway (Luo et al., 2012a, Luo et al., 2012b, Luo et al., 2012). In in vitro (HUVECs model) and in vivo studies (zebrafish model), Liang et al. (2015) demonstrated the anti-angiogenic effect of KMF via VEGF and FGF angiogenic promoters inactivation that are further known to interact with tyrosine kinase-associated angiogenic receptors. Fig. 6 summarizes the various above discussed molecular targets of KMF in the inhibition of cancer angiogenesis and further research is required to explore the remaining details of its mechanisms of action.",

            "text": "Metastasis is considered as a hallmark of uncontrolled proliferation of the tumour cells at primary site followed by the invasion to the nearby tissue and invasion to the distant organs via bloodstream. The EMT proteins (Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transitions), such as E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are known to play a paramount role in the process of metastasis by trailing the cell-cell contacts (Short et al., 2016, Tulotta et al., 2016, Zhu et al., 2016). Therefore, EMT proteins are considered as promising targets to combat tumour metastasis. The STAT3 is another most widely studied transcription factor associated with cancer metastasis and survival which has been found to be suppressed by KMF treatment in human prostate cancer cells (DU145) (Kwon, Kang, Kang, & Yoon, 2010). In a study by Chen et al. (2013), the anti-metastatic effect of KMF in human osteosarcoma cells (OS) was investigated by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of a transcription factor called activator protein (AP-1) which resulted in reduced expression of MMP-2 & 9 (Chen et al., 2013). Moreover, the other associated molecules, including ERK 1/2 and p38 were also found to be down-regulated under KMF treatment (Fig. 6). Similarly, ERK 1/2-mediated down-regulation of MMPs has observed in KMF-treated human tongue squamous cancer cells (SCC4) (Lin et al., 2013). In another study, KMF suppressed the transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) induced human non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, A549) transition from epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) and migration by abolishing Akt1-mediated Smad3 phosphorylation (Eunji, Park, Choi, Jeon, & Kim, 2015). Correspondingly, Hang, Zhao, Chen, Sun, and Zhang (2015) observed the modulation of EMT-cognate proteins, including E-cadherin and vimentin in KMF-treated non-minuscule lung cancer cells (Hang et al., 2015).",

However, chronic inflammation has been considered to be associated with the progression of various diseases, including cancer, arthritis, and neurodegeneration (Tuli et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2015). KMF has been proven to be a potent inhibitor of pro-inflammatory molecules such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (Kong et al., 2013a, Kong et al., 2013b, Liu et al., 2014). The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of KMF are mainly mediated (Fig. 7\n) by the down-regulation of several transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B) and STAT that have ability to stimulate the activation of inflammatory molecules (Hamalainen, Nieminen, Vuorela, Heinonen, & Moilanen, 2007). Garcia-Mediavilla et al. (2007) examined the anti-inflammatory potential of KMF in the human hepatocyte-derived cell line and proved that KMF was able to reduce the expression of C-reactive protein (CRP), COX-2, and iNOS via alterations in NF-\u03baB pathway. Osteopontin (OPN), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cytokine, which engenders and activates the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling, has been found to be down-regulated in aldosterone-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by KMF (Liu et al., 2014). Comparably, KMF treatment in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages revealed the consequential down-regulation of COX-2, iNOS and TNF-\u03b1 (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1) both at transcriptional and translational levels via inhibition of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factor (Kim et al., 2015, Kim et al., 2015). Moreover, the protein kinase cascade mechanisms governed by Src, Syk, IRAK1, and IRAK4 that are usually involved in the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcriptional factors can also be blocked by KMF. The docking studies have substantiated the homogeneous binding energies of KMF as that of MG-132 which is considered to be a potent NF-\u03baB inhibitor (Kadioglu, Nass, Saeed, Schuler, & Efferth, 2015). Therefore, evidences are suggesting that KMF may have great potential as an anti-inflammatory drug and could be introduced for in vivo trial.",

            "text": "Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generated by enzymatic reactions during metabolism are the major source of harmful oxidative stress (Adegoke and Forbes, 2015, Hazra et al., 2004). Although human body has antioxidant enzymes as a defenses mechanism that constantly neutralizes the ROS, the excess concentrations of ROS become fatal and cause cellular dysfunction, oxygen toxicity, senescent, stroke, autoimmune diseases, cancer, Parkinson\u2019s disease, infection and arteriosclerosis (Adegoke and Forbes, 2015, Melo et al., 2015). Studies have been performed using various funtional foods with antioxidant agents that may be availed to dispense ROS (Gao and Yang, 1999, Kim et al., 2003). These results showed that flavonols could be effective secondary metabolites against oxidative stress (Yoshida et al., 2008). KMF directly scavenges peroxynitrite (reactive nitrogen species) and hydroxyl radicals at low concentration whereas at high concentrations it enhances the expression of antioxidant enzymes (Calderon-Montano et al., 2011). The proposed mechanisms of action of KMF as a potent antioxidant have been reported to be associated with its up-regulatory effect on antioxidant response elements (ARE)-mediated antioxidative enzymes (Fig. 8\n), such as heme oxygenase, catalase and superoxide dismutases (SODs) under the control of Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways (Saw et al., 2014). KMF can also be utilized in the inhibition of platelet aggregation and LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) oxidative susceptibility (Kowalski, Samojedny, Paul, Pietsz, & Wilczok, 2005). Choe et al. (2012) extracted and purified KMF from the roots of Rhodiola sachalinensis and anticipated its antioxidant potential (Choe et al., 2012). Similarly, Wahab et al. (2014) extracted KMF from the beans of Cassia alata to study its antioxidant properties. KMF has additionally been found to bulwark myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats by incrementing the calibers of SOD and decrementing the activity of P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Zhou et al., 2015). In a study, utilizing 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine induced male Wistar rats, Nirmala and Ramanathan (2011) investigated that KMF treatment not only lowered down the erythrocyte lysate and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) but additionally up-regulated the antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, SOD, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) levels (Nirmala & Ramanathan, 2011). Likewise, hepatoprotective effect of KMF glycosides has been investigated against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injuries in mice by uplifting the oxidative stress scavenging potential (Wang et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015). In osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, KMF inverted the antimycin A (AMA)-induced toxicity by averting the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and accumulation of intracellular calcium ions and ROS via P(I)3K-Akt-CREB pathway (Choi, 2011).",

In this scenario, KMF could act as a promising molecule to boost the therapeutic potential of the chemotherapy by refining the pharmacokinetics as well as by subsisting side effects of the therapy. A coalescence of quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin was found to be significantly more efficacious antiproliferative agent against mouse liver cancer cells Hepa-1c1c7 and human prostate cancer cells LNCaP (Campbell, King, Harmston, Lila, & Erdman, 2006). In a study utilizing male SD rat models, Xu, Yang, Zheng, Zhu, and Zhu (2006) observed that KMF improves the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine by reducing the drug metabolic processes (Xu et al., 2006). Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen has also been found to be altered by KMF via inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes, including CYP3A (Piao, Shin, & Choi, 2008). Besides inhibiting the activity of phase I CYPs enzymes, KMF additionally works as an inhibitor of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or P-glycoproteins when co-administrated with etoposide and quercetin in rats and in human leukemic cells K562/A, respectively (Li et al., 2009, Yanqiu et al., 2013). The neuroprotective effects of quercetin, KMF and biapigenin have been investigated against kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced neuronal cell death by Silva, Oliveira, Dias, and Malva (2008). Utilizing ovarian cancer cell lines, Luo et al. investigated that KMF intensified the apoptotic effect of cisplatin by significantly down-regulating c-myc gene expression (Luo, Daddysman, Rankin, Jiang, & Chen, 2010). Thus, drug combinations could co-act and potentiate the control of intricate biological disorders. Besides governing these promising pharmacological effects, KMF has additionally been known to promote other organ protective effects as summarized in Table 2\n.",

            "text": "Different methodologies, including estimation of dietary intake, determination of plasma or urinary level, have been used to study the absorption and bioavailability potential of flavonoids. In the USA and Netherlands, KMF gives an important contribution to the daily consumption of flavonoids (25\u201333%), with a mean intake of 6\u201310 mg/day (Hertog et al., 1993, Sampson et al., 2002). Though, studies have been done concerning the assimilation of other flavonoids, like quercetin, the data on the bioavailability of KMF has still remained to elucidate. DeVries et al. (1998), conducted a 7-days study by utilizing tea and onions-based diet in a group of volunteers to quantify the concentrations of KMF in plasma and urine (DeVries et al., 1998). Their results revealed that KMF was excreted in about 2.5% of its consumed quantity which was higher than for quercetin (0.5%) after 4 h of dose ingestion. Similarly, using healthy humans as subject models, DuPont, Day, Bennett, Mellon, and Kroon (2004) have also reported the similar concentration (0.05 mM) of KMF in plasma after 4 h of intake of endive-based diet, containing up to 246 mg of KMF per kg (DuPont et al., 2004). In another study, researchers observed the KMF excrete about 0.9% of the total consumed flavonoids from broccoli (Nielsen, Kall, Justesen, Schou, & Dragsted, 1997). Furthermore, the absorption rate of KMF from small intestine mainly depends on the microbial hydrolysis of \u03b2-glucuronide before aglycone uptake. Rowland, Wiseman, Sanders, Adlercreutz, and Bowey (2000), reported that variation in the gut microflora population alters the absorption rate of KMF by modulating the process of hydrolysis of conjugates and alterations in aglycone ring (Rowland et al., 2000). Chromatographic studies revealed the presence of early absorption peak preferentially due to the absorption of kaempferol-3-glucoside. Nemeth et al. (2003), investigated that kaempferol-3-glucoside is the most preferred substrate for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, as compared to kaempferol-3-(6-malonyl)-glucoside and kaempferol-3-glucuronide (Nemeth et al., 2003). Being hydrophilic in nature, kaempferol-3-glucuronide is found to be absorbed directly from the small intestine. KMF glucosides are preferentially absorbed via mechanisms of active transport and deglycosylation processes as reported for quercetin absorption (Day et al., 2003, Day et al., 2000, Gee et al., 2000, Nemeth et al., 2003). Hydroxylation is a phase I cytochrome P450 dependent enzymatic activity that is known to be involved in the metabolism of KMF. In a study, Nielsen, Breinholt, Justesen, Cornett, and Dragsted (1998), investigated the hydroxylation capability of microsomes toward flavonols and flavones (Nielsen et al., 1998). Like quercetin, KMF may also be subjected to basic phase II metabolic conjugation in accumulation with glucuronide or sulphate (Day et al., 2001). It is essential to identify KMF metabolites to know the various circulating forms of this moiety. DuPont et al. (2004), has observed the conjugated form of KMF metabolite i.e. kaempferol-3-glucuronide (55\u201380%) in the circulating plasma (DuPont et al., 2004). Another form of metabolite subsists as kaempferol-7-sulphate which could be due to the action of human hepatocytes (Day et al., 2001). These evidences have suggested the lesser bioavailability of KMF in the bloodstream, which needs to be improved with the aim to utilize the full therapeutic potential of KMF. Using G. biloba extract-phospholipid complexes (GBP) of KMF, Chen et al. (2010), have shown the increase in oral bioavailability of flavonoids including quercetin and KMF in a rat model (Chen et al., 2010). Similarly, Wang et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015, investigated that phospholipid complex (TFH-PC) of KMF may not only increase the bioavailability (172%) but also increase the solubility (22.0 folds) in comparison to total intake of flavonoids (Wang et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015). Another approach to improve the bioavailability of the therapeutically active flavonols is to explore the effect of the supplemented food matrix ingredients. So far, very limited data are reported about the effect of food ingredients on absorption and bioavailability of KMF. It has been found that the total absorption and bioavailability of flavonoids are associated with the composition of carbohydrate based food matrix. Rodriguez-Mateos, Oruna-Concha, Kwik-Uribe, Vidal, and Spencer (2012), demonstrated that the maltitol and sucrose were found to increase and decrease the absorption of flavonoids by altering the activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2012). Also, the methylation of flavonoids, such as genistein and KMF, appeared to modulate the metabolism as well as transportation of these wonderful molecules. Cao, Jing, Wu, and Shi (2013), indicated that the methylation of KMF not only enhances its transporting ability but also increases its hydrophobicity which further assists in the absorption, bioavailability, and binding affinity to both HSA (human serum albumin) and ovalbumin (Cao et al., 2013). Furthermore, route of administration and nanotechnology-mediated implementations in the drug delivery may also ameliorate the bioavailability of KMF. In 2009, Barve et al. reported that the half-life of KMF was 3\u20134 h and 1\u20132 h, respectively, after intravenous (10 and 25 mg/kg) and oral (100 and 250 mg/kg) dosages of KMF in male SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats (Barve et al., 2009). In a study, Luo et al., 2012a, Luo et al., 2012b, Luo et al., 2012, observed that encapsulated poly (ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) and poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) drug dosages were found to be more efficacious than KMF alone (Luo et al., 2012a, Luo et al., 2012b, Luo et al., 2012). Similarly, nano-suspension of KMF was found to improve its bioavailability as well as solubility by increasing the Cmax and Area under the curve (AUC0-\u221e) value (Qian et al., 2016). Therefore, the data confirmed the significance of bioavailability and solubility of flavonoids to exert their bioactivity and indicated that improving these important pharmacokinetic parameters may probably further enhance the biological efficacy and potential physiological capacity of KMF.",

An inverse association of KMF intake with advanced stage (stage III/IV or stage IV, but not non-advanced) prostate cancer in the Netherlands Cohort Study was also described (Geybels et al., 2013). Although there was no remarkable relationships between high KMF intake and colorectal cancer risk among women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (Lin et al., 2006), a statistically significant reduction in the risk of advanced adenoma recurrence was observed in Polyp Prevention Trial (Bobe, Sansbury, et al., 2008). Furthermore, consumption of higher dose of KMF was found to be protective against gastric cancer in a case-control study conducted in the Spain (Garcia-Closas, Gonzalez, Agudo, & Riboli, 1999). KMF intake was also significantly associated with decreased risk of pancreatic cancer among current smokers (but not among never or former smokers) in the large Multiethnic Cohort Study with participants from Hawaii and California (Nothlings, Murphy, Wilkens, Henderson, & Kolonel, 2007) and among male smokers who were not consuming supplements of vitamin E or \u03b2-carotene in the \u03b1-Tocopherol, \u03b2-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (Bobe, Weinstein, et al., 2008). Moreover, high intakes of KMF were inversely associated with the development of lung tumour in a case-control study carried out in Los Angeles County, manifesting still only among tobacco smokers and not among non-smokers (Cui et al., 2008). The data of a case-control study of lung cancer in women in Spain exhibited a non-significant association for the highest vs. lowest tertile intake of KMF (Garcia-Closas, Agudo, Gonzalez, & Riboli, 1998).",

Evidences have suggested the salutary effects of dietary KMF in plummeting the peril of lethal diseases, such as cancer. Current chemotherapeutic agents are known to pose serious health risks which could be solved by utilizing natural bioactive metabolites like KMF. However, the scientific community should always endeavour to ameliorate the potency of such wondrous molecules. As the structure of KMF revealed the availability of electron donor atoms, such as oxygen which can make the co-ordinate bond with metal atoms and resulting metal complexes of KMF may further boost its biological activity (Kashyap et al., 2016, Kashyap et al., 2016, Tuli et al., 2014). Computational implements like QSAR models can be acclimated to explore the unknown molecular interactions of KMF with recognized cellular receptors (Bose, Michael, Prashanth, & Chitraa, 2015). Synergistic amalgamations with other promising natural bioactive molecules could also be visually perceived as another prospective of future study to enhance the therapeutic potential of KMF (Tuli, Kashyap, & Sharma, 2015). Moreover, the role of KMF in modulating the expression and activity of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as CYPs could also avail the scientific communities to come forward to design novel strategies with subsisting chemotherapeutic agents (Bibi, 2008, Huang et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2006a, Zhang et al., 2006b). Such approaches might be auxiliary in reducing the KMF-associated toxic (Canada et al., 1989, Silva et al., 1997) effects by lowering the requisite of active dosages. Furthermore, novel derivatives of KMF could additionally be an option to ameliorate the potency as well as dose-associated toxicity of this molecule. Rho and his colleagues have designed KMF predicated rhamnosides and purposed them as a paramount moiety in the obviation of inflammatory disorders (Rho et al., 2011). Lower potency of a drug has also been found to be associated with its poor solubility and low bioavailability that can further be amended by utilizing the modern nanotechnology implements (Kuldeep and Ganju, 2014, Pinho et al., 2014). Luo et al., 2012a, Luo et al., 2012b, Luo et al., 2012, have designed a novel nano-formulation for KMF utilizing Poly DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, nanoparticles with amended bioavailability and cytotoxic effect against ovarian cancer (Luo et al., 2012a, Luo et al., 2012b, Luo et al., 2012). Moreover, the acerbic and astringent taste of most of the flavonoids could additionally be overcome by utilizing the nanotechnology mediated encapsulation processes which may further enhance their applicability on the more astronomically immense scale in aliment items (Munin and Edwards-Levy, 2011). Thus, KMF could prove to be a promising therapeutic agent and is certainly worth of further molecular studies.",

Furthermore, KMF inhibits the Akt/mTOR/p07S6K, a well resolved signaling pathways in the neovascularization during the tumour progression. It also inhibits the STAT3 or its phosphorylation that have been required for the signaling cascades via HIF-1\u03b1 activation. Inflammatory mediators like iNOS which activates the VEGF are noticed as down-regulated by KMF. Moreover KMF also inhibits the MMPs (MMP 2 & 9) via inhibition of MAPK/Akt pathways, both of these enzymes are important for the ECM remodelling during the cancer progression and facilitate the cancer metastasis.",
