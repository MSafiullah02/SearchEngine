Different terms are used to describe the clinical presentations of HLH; in this Viewpoint, we use cytokine storm syndromes. Cytokine storm syndromes represent a key interface between rheumatology and general internal medicine. Rheumatologists often lead in management, in view of their experience with immunosuppressive therapies and managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders or infection (known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome [sHLH/MAS]). However, these patients might present to any medical specialty.",

Off-licence anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is recommended (if available) in treatment algorithms for HLH,2, 3, 4, 5 but guidance regarding the route of administration is absent. Subcutaneous dosing could be difficult in patients with cytokine storm syndromes due to unreliable absorption in the context of critical illness and the fact that multiple daily injections are needed to achieve high-doses. Additionally, subcutaneous dosing can be painful and might be contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Therefore, intravenous anakinra is already used in clinical practice for some cases of cytokine storm syndrome, including sHLH/MAS, although it is an off-licence indication and route of administration and little evidence exists to support its efficacy in this context. In this Viewpoint, we describe current challenges in managing patients with cytokine storm syndromes and our experience using intravenous anakinra in patients with sHLH/MAS in three international tertiary centres. We review the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of intravenous anakinra, define potential indications for intravenous dosing in patients with cytokine storm syndromes, and outline strategies to improve outcomes in these rapidly fatal and complex conditions.",

Initiation of treatment is time sensitive, but missed and delayed diagnoses are common. Recognition of cytokine storm syndromes is challenging because the hyperinflammatory spectrum ranges from an innocuous and indolent state to a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia, with non-specific overlapping features of many systemic illnesses, including the potential underlying drivers themselves (eg, sepsis, malignancy, and rheumatic disease).",

Diagnostic criteria for sHLH have not been universally agreed nor adopted, and current strategies (using HLH-2004 guidelines and HScore) have substantial limitations. The HScore has been shown to be more accurate for diagnosis than the HLH-2004 criteria if used at the time of presentation (sensitivity of 90%, but specificity of only 79%),28 although it is not widely used by haemato-oncologists in clinical practice. Use of the HLH-2004 criteria in adults is questionable, as the criteria have only been validated in children and include specialist tests (eg, soluble CD25) that are expensive, often difficult to access, and associated with long turnaround times for results in some centres, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment. Hyperferritinaemia is a key laboratory feature in both paediatric and adult practice. Ferritin levels within the normal range (<500 ng/mL) have a high negative predictive value for HLH, and this parameter has been incorporated in diagnostic algorithms, given the wide availability and low cost of the ferritin test.4, 6 Ferritin levels of more than 10 000 mg/L are diagnostic of HLH in children, with 96% specificity and 90% sensitivity.29 Ferritin level correlates with disease activity, and serial measurements are useful to monitor the response to treatment and relapse.3, 30 Both peak ferritin levels and a fall of less than 50% after treatment are associated with higher mortality.30 Hyperferritinaemia is less specific for HLH in adults,31, 32 as it can have other causes including liver failure. Different specialties might prioritise some features for diagnostic confirmation, adding further complexity. Tissue haemophagocytosis is probably the most contentious criteria for HLH diagnosis, although technically it is not considered essential for diagnosis. Haemophagocytosis has limited sensitivity and specificity, might be absent in the early stages of disease, and might be present in critical illness without sHLH.7\n",

Anakinra is recommended off-licence for management of sHLH/MAS, starting with at least 1\u20132 mg/kg per day, increasing to a maximum of 8 mg/kg per day3 (paediatric doses are often higher). Notably, refractory cases of sHLH/MAS have been reported to require 100 mg anakinra four times per day;50 as such, some clinicians choose to start at higher doses and down titrate the dose when the inflammation is controlled. Anakinra is also used intravenously in clinical practice for patients with cytokine storm syndromes, and the intravenous route was endorsed in a recent multidisciplinary consensus guideline,4 despite limited rationale and supportive evidence. It is unclear when or why the practice of intravenous administration of anakinra first started; its use might have originated from a desire to achieve a rapid onset of action in critically unwell patients with high mortality, limited treatment options, and purported poor peripheral absorption. Safety data from clinical trials of intravenous anakinra (24\u201348 mg/kg per day) in sepsis might have provided reassurance for its wider use in patients with cytokine storm syndromes, in whom secondary infections are almost universal, although the maximal treatment duration in these sepsis trials was only 72 hours.51 Long-term safety data for anakinra is reassuring in rheumatoid arthritis (3 years)52, 53 and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (5 years);54 steroids and comorbidities could increase the risk of infections.53\n",

The drug has longer half-lives in more obese individuals, suggesting that those with greater adipose tissue have slower anakinra transport and consequently less rapid systemic subcutaneous absorption.56 The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of anakinra is higher with intravenous dosing compared with subcutaneous dosing (24\u201329 times higher).56, 57 Furthermore, the time to achieve maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after subcutaneous injection ranged from 3\u00b77 h to 4\u00b73 h56 in healthy volunteers (3\u20137 hours in patients with rheumatoid arthritis).55 Taken together these findings suggest that intravenous dosing of anakinra enables a higher and faster maximal plasma concentration (ie, higher Cmax and shorter Tmax) to be achieved, compared with subcutaneous delivery. To our knowledge, pharmacokinetic studies have not been done in patients with subcutaneous oedema, but given the influence of adiposity on the absorption rate of subcutaneous anakinra, it is plausible that intraveous dosing might be preferable in patients with peripheral oedema and anasarca.

Based on these results, a confirmatory phase 3 trial was done in 696 patients with severe sepsis comparing intravenous anakinra (100 mg bolus followed by a 72 h continuous infusion at 2 mg/kg per h; n=350) and placebo (n=346).68 Safety data for the anakinra and placebo groups were comparable. This study68 was discontinued following an interim analysis, in which no survival benefit of anakinra could be shown. In a retrospective review 20 years after the original phase 3 trial67 was completed, 43 (5\u00b76%) of 763 patients with available data could be classified as having hyperinflammation at enrolment, based on deranged liver function and coagulopathy as proxy markers. 26 (60%) of these patients received intravenous anakinra and 17 (40%) received placebo, with a 28-day mortality of 35% and 65%, respectively (p=0\u00b70006).69 These post-hoc results suggest that a subgroup of patients with sepsis and inflammation (macrophage activation-like syndrome) might respond to anakinra and potentially other immunotherapy drugs. The PROVIDE trial (NCT03332225) is a double-blind randomised trial of personalised immunotherapy in sepsis, in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg of intravenous anakinra three times daily, subcutaneous recombinant human IFN\u03b3 (rhIFN\u03b3), or placebo for 7 days, based on a panel of biomarkers and laboratory tests to identify a hyperinflammatory profile (treated with anakinra) or hypoinflammatory profiles (treated with rhIFN\u03b3). Although clinical trials of anakinra in sepsis have so far shown equivocal efficacy, they have not raised any safety concerns in the anakinra groups. The results of the PROVIDE trial are awaited.",

However, in a subgroup of patients, treated in our tertiary care centres and elsewhere, intravenous dosing is already in use for induction, with or without subcutaneous maintenance thereafter. We suggest starting anakinra within 12 h of sufficient clinical suspicion, and therefore prefilled syringes of anakinra should be stocked and locally available for emergency, out-of-hours access. As described in this Viewpoint, intravenous dosing of anakinra achieves a higher and faster maximal plasma concentration (higher Cmax and shorter Tmax), compared with subcutaneous delivery. The intravenous route is usually preferred if high doses (>2 mg/kg per day or >100 mg/day) are required (eg, to avoid pain from multiple daily injections); hence induction doses are often given by the intravenous route in critically ill patients, in whom higher starting doses are often required. Furthermore the intravenous route might be preferred if subcutaneous administration is relatively contraindicated, for example severe thrombocytopenia (platelets <20 \u00d7 109/L), haemorrhagic complications, subcutaneous skin oedema (that could impede absorption, similar to the effects of adiposity),56 or if there are neurological symptoms. If there are substantial concerns regarding infection, the intravenous route could be favoured because of the shorter half-life of the drug compared with subcutaneous dosing, potentially allowing for faster wash-out after drug discontinuation.",

Anakinra is a key drug used in the first-line management of patients with cytokine storm syndromes, and as such there are ongoing national initiatives in the UK to improve early access to this potentially life-saving treatment, similar to the existing comissioning policies for anakinra in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated MAS74 and adult-onset Still's disease.75\n",

The heterogenity and perceived rarity of cytokine storm syndromes, coupled with a reticence to conduct clinical trials in critically ill patients, has hampered the development of novel therapies.

This includes switching off the cytokine storm, treating the underlying cause, and treating and preventing complications. To target the cytokine storm, immunosuppressants (often in combination) are used in an induction-maintenance treatment paradigm. Notably, higher doses of anakinra are often required in paediatric practice. Second-line therapies are added if inflammation is not controlled. A personalised approach for tapering (withdrawal) of therapy is recommended when inflammation is controlled. The figure illustrates the positioning of anakinra in a management framework for HLH and is not intended as a definitive treatment guideline for cytokine storm syndromes, and the various underlying drivers.
