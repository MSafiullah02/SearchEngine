            "text": "On February 5th, 2016 the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights Mr Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein urged abortion-banning Latin American countries affected by the Zika outbreak to legalize abortion, and allow pregnant women affected by the virus to choose whether to terminate their pregnancy (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 2016). In Brazil, the country most affected by the Zika outbreak, abortion is illegal, as in several other Latin American countries affected by the outbreak, including Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela and Peru. Does the Zika outbreak justify a change in abortion laws in Latin American countries? Although the ethics of abortion should certainly be debated, and both pro-abortion and anti-abortion sides should be free to voice their concerns, the plea to abortion in the context of the Zika outbreak is problematic. The link between the Zika outbreak and abortion could prove a major distraction from what would actually help the most vulnerable and affected: meeting their basic health needs (i.e. preventive measures), and fostering research and development (R&D) leading to a vaccine or treatment for Zika. These should surely be the priorities when it comes to addressing such a poverty-related disease.",

Of the 3177 pregnant women infected with the Zika virus in Colombia, none had given birth to an infant with microcephaly. Although the causal relation between the mosquito-born Zika virus and microcephaly has been recently established, (Rasmussen et al. 2016; Victora et al. 2016) prenatal tests and ultrasound may not necessarily detect of microcephaly until the third trimester (Camosy 2016; Romero 2016).",

Although 67 % of Brazilians are in favor of the current law, and only 11 % are in favor of a more relaxed law, (Senra 2016; Diniz 2016) pro-abortion activists in Brazil, led by a group of law professors from University of Brazilia, are about to petition the Brazilian Supreme Court to legalize abortion (Senra 2016; Diniz 2016). They claim that access to legal and safe abortion is an effective solution for dealing with an increased risk of birth defects (Diniz 2016; Gostin and Phelan 2016; Yamin 2016). As such, they claim that the Brazilian government have the duty to provide access to safe abortion services in public hospitals for all Brazilian women\u2014particularly for those in the poorest and most affected regions of the country, and who do not have the financial means to procure safe abortions in private clinics (Diniz 2016; Gostin and Phelan 2016; Yamin 2016). Other organizations abroad are echoing the same concerns. For example, the Canada-based group Women on Web that sends abortifacient drugs like Mifepristone and Misoprostol to women wanting an abortion in countries where it is legally prohibited has voiced their \u2018worry that these women will turn to unsafe abortion methods, while we can help them with a safe, medical abortion\u2019(Miller 2016). Planned Parenthood\u2019s international arm has developed a special Zika virus fundraising campaign, (Mora 2016) and Amnesty International has warned about the \u2018devastating effect\u2019 of anti-abortion laws (Dawber and Marters 2016).",

Health care resources are particularly scarce in the developing countries affected by the Zika outbreak, requiring local governments and communities to define health care priorities carefully. The fact that the Zika outbreak is a public health concern in need of an urgent remedy is not controversial. Nor is the importance of finding, and implementing effective solutions to the Zika virus outbreak. The controversy lies in whether abortion legalization should be conceived of as such an effective solution to the outbreak, particularly for pregnant women in the poorest and most affected regions, and if so, whether it constitutes a legitimate means to a worthwhile end. The latter question concerns what is due to human individuals in their earlier stages of development, and is at the center of the abortion debate. Here I am interested in the former question, which is the one more specifically focused on issues relating to global health and poverty.",

Because neglected diseases affect mainly or exclusively poor populations with little or no purchasing power, there is insufficient medical knowledge about its causes, as well as little market incentive to foster research and development (R&D) for medical products addressing these medical conditions (Hollis and Pogge 2008). Typically, therefore, there is no adequate prophylactic and therapeutic medication for neglected diseases, mainly because the afflicted population cannot afford the treatment\u2019s price (Hollis and Pogge 2008).",

Simple precautionary measures, such as cleaning and using non-toxic insecticides to eliminate areas that breed mosquitos, teaching people how to clean and reduce the breeding of mosquitos in their vicinities, emphasizing the importance of using protective covering such as adequate clothing and mosquitos nets, and distributing insects repellent to poor communities are examples of some measures that would immediately help in reducing the risks of infection.",

In short, the Zika outbreak, therefore, is not the place to have this debate, because the moral controversies of abortion distract law and policymakers from what needs to be done to address the outbreak effectively. Priorities in health care resources allocation need to be set carefully, given that resources are scarce. And not only material, but also human resources are finite: political will, and attention need to be focused on the main measures that can solve Zika-related problems, rather than squandered in an intense moral debate. Brazil is facing this important public health problem amidst a number of other difficult political, economic, and social challenges. To address the Zika outbreak successfully, therefore, Brazil\u2014and particularly the frail Rouseff/Temer administration\u2014needs to focus its energies on specific health questions, rather than on the intractable moral ones.",
