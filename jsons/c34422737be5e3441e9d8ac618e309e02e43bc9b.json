McNeill, Professor of History at the University of Chicago thinks that infectious diseases are \"one of the fundamental parameters and determinants of human society\". 3 This book has also argued that if the end of the Hittite Empire was due to civil war or invasion by neighbors then why was the capital Hattusa abandoned over a short period of time and not destroyed or occupied by the new victors, as the archaeological evidence has shown. This book has shown that the 1322 BCE Hittite epidemic was not the fatal blow that ended the Hittite Empire as portrayed by Prof. Wynn, Prof. Hare and Dr. Cooray and that it was not caused by smallpox, as suggested by them, but by bubonic plague. It has also listed ten possible diseases that could be implicated in the end of the Hittite Empire 120 years later, along with the end of the Bronze Age. Of those ten diseases, fi ve are so lethal that they are still used as germ warfare agents. But, bubonic plague, tularemia and smallpox remain the main possible diseases implicated as the causes.",

The only other things that could have been ubiquitous across the whole region would have been post-volcanic or post-comet climate change, leading to drought then famine and fi nally infectious diseases. These diseases know no boundaries; hence they spread across the whole region.",

What caused the mass migrations of the general population if not disease? What caused the mass migrations of the \"Sea Peoples\" if not disease? Why were cities abandoned if not for disease? And fi nally why are historians not focusing on disease as a possible cofactor in history, often a very signifi cant cofactor as shown by this book? This book has also shown that infectious disease epidemics contributed to the fall of ancient Carthage and played a signifi cant role for change in the history of the Mediterranean.",

New plagues such as HIV/Aids, Ebola and SARS are treated in the same way as the original plagues, namely with isolation and quarantine. That new emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as antibiotic resistant tuberculosis are now appearing and show us how impotent we are when it comes to controlling infectious diseases. We have learned that new strains of super viruses made from the combination of human, pig and bird viruses, such as H1N1 Swine Flu will become more common in the future and have the capacity to become drug resistant, hence severely threatening mankind yet again; as did the infectious diseases that ended the Bronze Age and Hittite Empire, thousands of years ago.",

Archaeological digs should engage a paleoentomologist to look for the remains of bubonic plague rats and fl eas for example, as bubonic plague was one of the main scourges of the ancient world. Paleoparasitologists should also be used to determine what parasites may have infected the skeleton. Paleoparasitologists could sample the soil around where the abdomen would have been, looking for the eggs of any parasites. Then all skeletons found should have DNA testing, if possible, to identify any infectious diseases in the body that may have contributed to its death, along with examination by a properly trained forensic paleoanthropologist.",
