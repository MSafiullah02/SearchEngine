            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, even in industrialised countries, and its incidence is highest among children aged < 5 years [1]. It is estimated that CAP is responsible for one-fifth of the deaths of young children, with two million deaths per year in the developing and developed world: the incidence of CAP among children aged < 5 years in developing countries is 0.29 per child-year, with a mortality rate of 1.3-2.6% and, in North America and Europe, its incidence in preschool children is still approximately 36 per 1,000 child-years [2]. Extensive infant vaccinations with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in developed countries have significantly decreased the rates of hospital admissions due to childhood CAP (1,3,4), but concerns have been raised by the increase in complicated CAP cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 5 and 19A over the last few years [3], [4]. Furthermore, an increase in deaths due to Staphylococcal pneumonia has been reported in North America, mainly following influenza infection [5].",

However, determining the aetiology of CAP is still difficult in routine clinical settings because appropriate lower respiratory tract specimens can rarely be obtained from children; the evaluation of upper respiratory tract secretions is only useful for viruses and atypical bacteria because typical bacteria are part of the normal flora colonising the upper respiratory tract [1]; and the detection of bacterial antigens in urine is related to the same flora and cannot be considered an aetiological marker of infection in children [2].",

Respiratory viruses are the most frequent pathogens in children aged between four months and five years (with syncytial virus and rhinovirus the main viruses), and are responsible for approximately 40% of the CAP episodes in hospitalised children [1], [10], [11]. S. pneumoniae accounts for one-third of the cases of all ages, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the main pathogen in children aged 5-15 years [1], [2], [3], [12] and also accounts for 30% of the cases in children aged 2-5 years [13]. Untypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Chlamydiophyla pneumoniae are much less frequently observed, partly because of the lack of reliable diagnostic tests [1], [2], [6], [7]. However, many studies published over the last ten years have recorded mixed viral/bacterial infections in up to 45% of cases of childhood, with S. pneumoniae being the most frequently involved bacteria [14], [15]. Dual viral infections have also been reported, with two or three viruses being detected in 10-20% of cases [11], [16]. Some viruses (e.g. bocavirus) are detected more frequently than others in such multiple infections, but it is not clear what this means in clinical practice or whether viral infection always precedes bacterial infection or not.",

The risk of CAP is five times higher in adult patients discharged after being hospitalised because of CAP than in those discharged with any other diagnosis [17] and, in primary care settings, it seems that subjects with CAP are also more likely to have experienced previously recurrent upper respiratory infections [18]. Moreover, studies of adopted patients have shown that the risk of a fatal outcome is greatly conditioned by genetic factors [19], which seem to confirm their major role in determining individual susceptibility [20]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many of the genes involved in innate and adaptive immune responses have been associated with host susceptibility [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], and some of these genes have also been associated with protection against [27] or susceptibility to infectious diseases other than CAP [28].",

The guidelines also point out that a child\u2019s overall clinical appearance and behaviour may predict severity, and so any child with a \u201ctoxic\u201d appearance (including a temperature of > 39 \u00b0C and tachycardia, a capillary refill time of > 2 s, dehydration and respiratory distress) should be admitted to hospital [1], [6], [7]. Further criteria for hospitalisation include a younger age (i.e. < 3-6 months), pre-existing comorbidities, suspected infection due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus, feeding difficulties, an inability to take oral medication because of vomiting, or the possibility of non-compliance with oral treatment because of the family environment [1].",

The risk of complications means that punctured lung puncture, bronchoalveolar lavage and thoracoscopic lung biopsy should be reserved for complicated and life-threatening cases that do not respond to theoretically adequate antibiotic therapy [1], [2], [6], [7]. Blood cultures are positive in 13\u201326.5% of children with complicated CAP, but in fewer than 5% of those with mild or moderate disease [10]. Molecular methods can increase the sensitivity of identifying bacterial pathogens in blood samples, but they are not routinely used in all laboratories [3]. Gram staining and cultured expectorated sputum are widely used to identify the bacteria responsible for adult CAP, but most children (particularly those in the first years of life) cannot provide adequate specimens for testing. Furthermore, otherwise healthy younger children frequently carry nasopharyngeal bacteria that are the same as those that can cause CAP and so, when sputum is induced, contamination often leads to unreliable results [10].",

The presence of cold-reacting antibodies against red blood cells in serum was once considered a reliable index of M. pneumoniae infection, but its accuracy has never been evaluated in children and so it is not currently recommended in paediatrics [10]. Serological methods (mainly enzyme assays) can detect specific IgM and IgG antibodies, and their sensitivity and specificity are good if two serum samples are evaluated (one taken during the acute phase and one during convalescence) [10]; however, once again, although they are useful for epidemiological studies, the findings cannot be used to make therapeutic decisions. Finally, PCR-based testing is theoretically very sensitive and specific, but it is not readily available or practical, and is not considered a standard means of identifying M. pneumoniae CAP [10]. The diagnostic tests used to identify Chlamydophila pneumoniae are even more limited because they are unreliable, and the performance of many of the serological assays is poor or inadequately validated [1], [10].",
