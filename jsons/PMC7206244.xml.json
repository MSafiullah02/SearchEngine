Multimodal clustering aims to divide the multimodal data information into different clusters in an unsupervised manner. The existing works usually are based on spectral clustering [14], subspace clustering [1], deep clustering [23] etc. On account of the amazing performance for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction tasks, deep clustering receives much attention in recent years [12, 17, 20, 23]. For deep multimodal clustering, the most common method extracts common features from different modalities [19] by using multiple deep neural networks (DNN) and clusters on the common features.\n",

The autoencoder based methods use autoencoders to extract common features of different modalities and choose common features that can best reconstruct the input data [16, 21]. However, autoencoders do not really discover the similarity of the common feature distributions. The DBM based methods [19] learn a joint representation of different modalities by DBM. But due to the high computational costs in high-dimensional data space [11], the DBM based methods have not been widely studied in recent years. The DCCA based methods [21] learn features that are most correlated from different modalities by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Like autoencoder based methods, DCCA based methods use autoencoders to extract features from different modalities, called deep canonically correlated autoencoder (DCCAE) [21]. The difference is that DCCAE further optimizes the canonical correlation among features of different modalities. But DCCA based methods lack the analysis of probability theory, which makes it difficult to measure the distribution differences of different modalities. Moreover, data of different modalities contain different numerical characteristics, and may not show obvious correlation. In this case, the depth typical correlation analysis may not be effective.",

Firstly, we apply Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) [2] to extract features from different modalities. By minimizing mutual information between raw data and the extracted features, VIB can control the amount of information owing through the network when extracting features. And due to the mutual information, VIB also provides explicit probabilistic analysis on feature space. Secondly, we apply cross reconstruction method during extracting features from different modalities, which can effectively reduce the distribution differences of different modalities in feature space. We also provide theoretical analysis to prove the similarity of multimodal distributions. Thirdly, we fuse the extracted features to common features using fusion layers. Finally, we cluster the common features using clustering algorithm. The entire process above constitute our deep multimodal clustering with cross reconstruction (DMCR).",

We use sigmoid as the activation function in the last layer of decoders, and use ReLU activation in the other layers of encoders and decoders. The parameters of our method are randomly initialized and we set the learning rate of Adam to 0.001.

Secondly, we reduce the distribution differences among multimodal features using cross reconstruction. Thirdly, we fuse the extracted features to common features. Finally, we cluster the common features using k-means. In addition, we prove that the proposed cross reconstruction method effectively reduce the distribution differences of multimodal features. We compare our DMCR algorithm with the state-of-the-art multimodal methods on many multimodal datasets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves obviously improvement on multimodal clustering task.",
