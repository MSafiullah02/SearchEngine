This is underpinned by the examination of three infectious diseases of global public health importance; Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dengue. These viral diseases share many features in common and hence an insight into their pathogenic features could reveal a common target molecule for future antiviral development. We propose the role of a master molecule, ADAM-17, as a potential therapeutic target against these three diseases. The cascades of events in the pro-inflammatory response are discussed in search of a common therapeutic target molecule that is evaluated computationally. This leads to the suggestion of a possible novel antiviral remedy. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider multiple emerging infectious diseases, to evaluate their common pathway of pathogenesis and to propose a prospective antiviral target molecule.",

There are four known dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, each of which can cause infection in humans. Secondary dengue infection with a heterotypic serotype to that responsible for primary infection can initiate the immunopathological phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, which may result in DHF and DSS. Clinical manifestations of DHF include haemorrhagic tendencies, plasma leakages and thrombocytopenia, each in addition to existing symptoms of DF. Patients who develop DSS exhibit all the symptoms of DF and DHF along with circulatory failure, hypotension and signs of systemic shock [7], [11].",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of Ebola is characterized by the initiation of an uncontrolled cytokine storm that includes overexpression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, free radicals and coagulation factors [12]. All Ebola-related fatalities are notable for triggering the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and the chemokines MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and MCP-1. [13], [14]. The inability of the human immune system to curb this cytokine storm through means of a negative feedback loop results in significant tissue and organ damage that frequently leads to case fatality [15]. At the onset of Ebolavirus (EBOV) infection the RNA polymerase cofactors VP35 and VP24 can inhibit \u03b1/\u03b2 interferon responses, the first line of antiviral defence. VP35 antagonizes the type 1 interferon response while VP24 is believed to disrupt both type 1 and type 2 interferon responses. VP35 and VP24 are also capable of inhibiting DC maturation and of initiating subsequent pro-inflammatory responses by immature DCs [16]. Activated macrophages produce TNF-\u03b1, which plays a major role in inflammatory responses. TNF-\u03b1 promotes migration of immune cells and activates apoptosis caspases. Raised levels of TNF-\u03b1 are observed in fatal cases of Ebola. TNF-\u03b1 also disrupts the endothelial barrier, causing cell leakage [17], [18].",

Increased numbers of activated plasmablasts, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were observed in all infected cases when compared to healthy control individuals. Significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected in all fatal cases compared to non-fatal cases. Analysis of animal models revealed profound up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) from the early stage of the infection [14], [19]. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) expressed by CD8+ T cells was detected at a markedly higher level in non-surviving patients. Both programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CTLA-4 concentrations were found much higher in fatal cases compared to survivors. Each of these proteins plays a role in regulating T cell homeostasis. Elevated expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 is correlated with T cell functional exhaustion as well as with poor viral clearance [20], [21].",

Disease severity is correlated with the production of a massive cytokine storm, lung infiltration by monocytes and macrophages, and a depletion of the lymphocyte population [22], [23]. Studies have revealed that host fatality is in fact not related with SARS-CoV virus replication but with virus-induced unregulated immune responses [24]. Histological examination of a mouse model of SARS two days post-infection showed a high viral titre with an increased presence of macrophages and some other T-lymphocytes in the focal perivascular infiltrate within the lungs. Along with heightened immune cell activation, bronchiolar epithelial necrosis and luminal necrotic debris were also visible. Migration of plasmacytoid DC and inflammatory cells (such as NK T cells, NK cells, macrophages and CD4+ T cells) to lungs was observed during early stage infection. A significant elevation of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels was also detected in early infection compared to the healthy control group. CD8+ T cells and neutrophils were found to migrate to the lungs during the late stage of infection [25], [26].",

DENV NS5 and NS4B proteins induce infected macrophages and endothelial cells to produce a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-6, MIF, MCP, CXCL10, CXCL11 and RANTES [27], [28], [29]. These mediators increase permeability and play role in inflammation and plasma leakage in vivo\n[28], [30], [31]. Infected DCs produce MMP-2 and MMP-9 which facilitate DC migration to lymph nodes [32]. An increased level of type 1 IFN is positively correlated with viral NS1 protein expression [33]. One of the most studied cytokines in dengue infection is TNF-\u03b1 which is expressed by both innate and adaptive immune cells. Raised levels of TNF-\u03b1 are reported particularly in DHF cases [34], [35]. Plasma leakage and coagulopathy are two ways by which TNF-\u03b1 plays a role in disease severity. Elevated IL-10 is observed in late infection, indicative of the activation of Treg cells in response to the preceding cytokine storm [30], [36].",

Monocytes/macrophages and DCs are the major site of DENV infection and replication [7], [37], [38]. A significant increase of T lymphocytes may be detected in fatal DENV cases compared to non-fatal groups. Further investigation revealed a notable rise in cells producing inflammatory cytokines in the liver of infected patients. The presence of nuclear vacuolar degeneration and swollen mitochondria in infected cases also indicates a mechanism involving cell death. Lung tissue samples from fatal cases show severe damage characterized by increased cellularity, the presence of mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and hyperplasia of alveolar macrophages [39]. Histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of heart, kidney and spleen detected damage to target organs in DENV-infected patients but no damage in healthy samples. Quantification analysis revealed the presence of lymphocytes, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at concentrations many fold higher than normal. Significant involvement of apoptosis is also detected in target organ biopsies from fatal cases [39], [40].",

            "text": "The three viral infections described above share some common features that establish a cytokine storm, as well as leading to pathogenic outcomes [41]. Following primary exposure to antigens, innate immunity acts as the first line of defence. Studies have revealed that monocyte/macrophage and DCs infiltrate the early sites of infection and virus replication [13], [42], [43], from where these immune cells containing virus particles later migrate to other organ and tissues [20], [39], [44]. In order to evade the innate immune response, the virus must inhibit the type-1 interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) response. Analysis of both in vitro and in vivo models strongly suggests that EBOV, SARS-CoV and DENV are each able to evade type-1 IFNs responses in order to establish infection [37], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Viral entry and infection are characterized by the expression of extremely high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by T lymphocytes [14], [19], [21], [25], [39]. Their excessive provokes a cytokine storm that is responsible for plasma leakage, vascular permeability and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as well as defective adaptive immunity [37], [49], [50]. These pathophysiological events enable efficient dissemination of virus, providing a metabolic milieu in which a fatal outcome may result [7], [51]. Apoptosis of lymphocytes can further facilitate such disease-related mortality [52]. Multiple in vivo studies have reported a massive level of lymphocyte apoptosis in these three infections [24], [53]. Lymphocytopenia is commonly observed among fatalities but is absent in survivors [13], [54].",

IL-6 may be considered as the master cytokine that can change its nature to serve in both pro- and anti-inflammatory [55]. Besides this, IL-6 is responsible for bridging the gap between innate and adaptive arms of the immune response [56], [57]. In view of this, it is a logical step to review the characteristics of IL-6 and its dual role as well as to determine how its performance may be triggered under infection conditions. Thus, we focus on the function of IL-6 in the following section and discuss how this keystone cytokine contributes to infection immunity.",

It has been speculated that, as an act of homeostasis, IL-10 is involved in counter-regulating the pro-inflammatory immune response before the cytokine environment becomes extreme [60]. However, the role of IL-10 remains unclear and extensive investigation is required to unravel the complex mechanisms involved. Researchers are particularly interested in dissecting the pathway that triggers the cytokine storm phenomenon and in understanding subsequent cellular events that relate to disease fatality.

Membrane-bound IL-6 receptors can become soluble through shedding or differential splicing, while the former one is the more frequent event [56], [62], [63], [64]. Depending on receptor states, IL-6 signaling may be either of two types: classic signaling and trans-signaling. Classic signaling requires binding of IL-6 with membrane-bound IL-6R whereas trans-signaling starts when IL-6 binds with sIL-6R [65], [66], [67]. IL-6 trans-signaling is pro-inflammatory while classic signaling is anti-inflammatory in nature. Details of these mechanisms are beyond the scope of this review.

            "text": "Switching between two different forms of IL-6 is dependent on the concentrations of IL-6 and sIL-6R. Under normal physiological conditions, the plasma level of IL-6 is minute, ranging between 2 and 6 pg/mL [74], [75], [76], while sIL-6R is detected at about 75 ng/mL [77], [78]. Therefore, in a steady state, the concentration of sIL-6R is more than 10,000 times higher than that of IL-6. During inflammation, however, IL-6 levels may increase up to 1 million fold [73], [76] whereas sIL-6R rises typically only 2\u20135 fold [79], [80]. Once challenged by an antigen, upon secretion IL-6 will first bind to sIL-6R and initiate pro-inflammatory responses. However, only when IL-6 levels exceed that of sIL-6R does it binds to IL-6R and thereby triggers an anti-inflammatory response. Thus, in order to maintain a sustained pro-inflammatory response and thereby block the anti-inflammatory response, the systemic concentration of sIL-6R must be higher than that of IL-6 [73]. It has been observed that selective blocking of IL-6 trans-signaling rather than the global IL-6 blockade is a more effective means to rescue mouse models from possible death [81]. Hence, IL-6 may be considered as an immunoregulatory master molecule the control of which governs pathogenic outcomes. Yet, there are still many questions surrounding the mechanism of action of IL-6 that need to be answered. Even if IL-6 is held responsible for escalating rates of fatality, theoretically at least, elevated IL-6 concentrations should eventually suppress levels of sIL-6R and thereby facilitate a switch back to anti-inflammatory responses during viral infection. However, quite the opposite is observed in fatal cases, suggestive of a complex mechanism behind this phenomenon. sIL-6R concentrations somehow remain high during the entire period of infection, thereby establishes a persistent pro-inflammatory response via trans-signaling. Thus, it can be reasonably presumed that there are other biomolecules interacting in this process which influence the sustained trans-signaling and result in cytokine storm-mediated fatality.",

            "text": "Since its discovery in 1997, ADAM-17, commonly known as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 converting enzyme, has drawn enormous interest as a potential therapeutic target in multiple disease pathways. ADAM-17 is closely associated with TNF-\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines [82], [83]. It has been found that TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 upregulate the transcription and expression of ADAM-17 [84]. Researchers have proposed that ADAM-17 can release the membrane-bound TNF-\u03b1 precursor to a soluble form which facilitates TNF-\u03b1-mediated inflammatory processes [85]. Of most relevance here, ADAM-17 is believed to be the master molecule that may explain uncontrolled IL-6 trans-signaling and increasing pro-inflammatory responses during infection. This is because ADAM-17 is the key protein responsible for membrane-bound IL-6R shedding and thus the production of sIL-6R [56], [86]. Apoptosis has been shown to act as a natural stimulus in ADAM-17-mediated IL-6R shedding from the surface of neutrophils and thereby contributes to pro-inflammatory trans-signaling responses [87]. Uncontrolled IL-6 trans-signaling could also be explained by this mechanism, from which a picture of how infection worsens can be envisaged.",

            "text": "During infection, in order to maintain homeostasis production of inflammatory cytokines is followed by a counter release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 increases the level of plasma glucocorticoid (cortisol) and IL-10 while also reducing the absolute number of lymphocytes [69]. The lymphocyte loss observed in pathogenesis is not mediated solely by apoptotic machinery, but also involves necrosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death. This event is mediated by elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 [13], [88]. This phenomenon can explain why anti-inflammatory cortisol and IL-10 levels remain high alongside lymphocytopenia in fatal cases. Detailed mechanism of lymphocyte loss is not yet understood, though it is believed that, multiple mediators (Fas/FasL, TNF-\u03b1 related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), pro-apoptotic gene Bim and Bid) triggered by TNF-\u03b1, play a pivotal role in this type of cell death [13], [89], [90]. Interaction of ADAM-17 with these mediators is reported in several studies which show how ADAM-17 is activated during neutrophil loss and then proceeds to generate more sIL-6R by cleaving IL-6R [87], [91], [92]. We propose this as the mechanism by which the level of sIL-6R remains higher than that of IL-6R throughout infection and explains how IL-6 skips the cis-signaling pathway. This event ultimately disrupts the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and establishes IL-6 trans-signaling mediated persistent pro-inflammatory responses. There is direct evidence that during apoptosis the presence of a pharmacological inhibitor of ADAM-17 restricts IL-6R shedding [56].",

As a consequence, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels rise. The concentrations of cortisol and IL-10 also increase gradually in order to maintain homeostasis and to activate a TNF-\u03b1-mediated apoptotic mechanism as part of a negative feedback loop. A combination of cell death and lymphocytopenia further stimulates ADAM-17 to shed more IL-6R by proteolysis. Subsequently, the level of sIL-6R also increases and bypasses IL-6-mediated classic-signaling. As a result, an uncontrolled trans-signaling-mediated inflammatory response prevails (Fig. 1\n). In this case, therefore, the infection proceeds to a fatal outcome.",

It is now well established that ADAM-17 mediated shedding of cell surface molecules are involved in progression of multiple pathological condition [82], [93], [94], [95], [96]. ADAM-17-induced IL-6 trans-signaling-mediated pathogenesis is now known to be a common feature of inflammatory bowel disease as well as of many respiratory diseases [97], [98], [99], [100], [101]. Hence, developing a selective inhibitor of ADAM-17 has been a challenge. Several ADAM-17 inhibitors have been tested as therapeutic candidates [83], [100]. For several years pharmaceutical companies like British Biotech, Chemicon, Glaxo SmithKline (GSK), Pfizer and Wyeth have also been conducting research on ADAM-17 inhibitors with the aim of developing therapeutics against rheumatoid arthritis [102], [103], [104], [105], [106]. Inhibitors like BB-94 developed by British Biotech, GW-3333 by GSK, TMI-005 by Wyeth, and INCB3619 by Incyte Corp have now been discontinued due to not achieving their targeted promise [102], [103], [107], [108]. Inhibitors failed to meet potential because of low efficacy, toxicity, undesired side effects and mostly due to inhibition of multiple proteases by ADAM-17, while targeted for only a specific shedding event [82]. The knowledge gap between in vivo and in vitro studies also contributed to these failings. Inhibitors designed in vitro do not always show the anticipated effect or desired efficacy in vivo since when the whole organism is considered multiple pharmacokinetic factors come into play in vivo which are not detectable in in vitro studies. In addition, our understanding of ADAM-17 biology is incomplete [100].",

            "text": "New research is therefore aiming to selectively block ADAM-17 with targeted inhibitors of higher specificity in order to increase efficacy and to diminish side effects [93]. This type of selective inhibitor should be designed to affect only a specified target subset through inhibiting a specific shedding event driven by ADAM-17 [93]. From the above discussion it also appears that development of a selective ADAM-17 inhibitor can arrest production of sIL-6R by inhibiting shedding of IL-6R. This inhibition may result in suppression of trans-signaling-mediated pro-inflammatory responses and initiation of classical-signaling-mediated anti-inflammatory responses, thereby balancing elevated cytokine levels and thus reducing disease pathogenicity. Such a selective inhibitor should prevent shedding of only IL-6R and not block all shedding events induced by ADAM-17 [93]. According to our hypothesis if generation of new sIL-6 can be inhibited it may be possible to stop unregulated IL-6 trans-signaling-mediated pro-inflammatory responses. Studies in murine models also suggest that inhibiting IL-6 trans-signaling can increase survival up to 100% [81]. Though failures of previous inhibitors may discourage drug companies to invest more in developing selective inhibitor against ADAM-17 but targeting ADAM-17 with highly selective inhibitor is still an attractive and promising approach to the researchers. If the same or similar mechanisms were to work in our selected viral infections, ADAM-17 inhibitors will not only show potential in future trials but will also bring great relief to infected patients as well. It might then be possible to develop a single therapeutic molecule that will be effective against multiple viral diseases. Although there is a long way to go to achieve commercial realization, the proposition of such a novel hypothesis provides a new dimension to future antiviral research in which a broad range antiviral will not only cure but also be easily affordable globally.",

IL-6R is additionally included due to its instrumental function in determining the pathogenic fate via differential IL-6 signaling. IL-10 and NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) represent the anti-inflammatory regulators. TNF, Fas, FasL, and TRAIL are selected because of their roles in anti-inflammatory regulation and the process of apoptosis.

This results in a huge complex network (\u201chairball\u201d), which has further been remodeled by Cytoscape [112] (Fig. 2\n). An insightful observation of this complex network shows three most crucial interactors NF-kB, P53 and Notch1. Among all the molecules in this network, these three exert magisterial regulation of our previously selected molecules, where ADAM-17 acts directly as a whistleblower. Several research groups have previously reported the regulatory role of NF-kB, P53 and Notch1 on our selected target molecules. NF-kB is believed to be a key regulator in IL-6 expression [113], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Upon infection, when stimulated by TLR ligands, macrophages activate Notch signaling to upregulate IL-6 production as well as to initiate inflammatory responses. Notch mediated upregulation of IL-6 is controlled by NF-kB as well as P53 [118], [119], [120]. Interestingly, Notch signaling is further activated by ADAM-17 [121], [122].",

The influence of ADAM-17 can be understood easily from this network, as described in our postulation. In addition, we constructed another network (Fig. 4\n) in GeneMANIA to show the direct interaction between ADAM-17 and our key regulatory molecules (TNF, NOTCH1, IL6R, TP53, TNFSF10). From this network influence of ADAM-17 over other regulatory molecules can be easily understood. Some recent studies on therapeutic development demonstrate that ADAM-17 inhibition downregulates Notch signaling [123], [124]. Hence, a rapid screening of molecular interactions to form a target-specific cluster has resolved the stochastic nature of a large number of molecules in that complex network. Here, as uncovered by this study ADAM-17 may be considered as a potential drug target to form the basis of a broad range therapeutic approach.",

In so doing, we have built a framework that might help to overcome the present knowledge gap surrounding the phenomenon of immune hyperstimulation-mediated fatality. We envisage that in the near future a ground-breaking transformation in research direction may possibly be based on our hypothesis. By utilizing computational modelling to analyse a vast volume of publicly accessible data, a systematic approach to understanding various infectious disease episodes can be achieved. This information may be of considerable value in enabling researchers to develop experimental models to test novel antiviral therapeutic designs. However, it is also acknowledged that due to the unavailability of a sizable amount of interactome data, the computational study in this review highlights several intrinsic limitations.",

Furthermore, while animal reservoirs may become infected with the discussed viruses they do not develop any clinical symptoms [157]. Reservoir hosts have some unique immune mechanism to maintain a disease free state against those viruses. This poses another crucial question, how a disease-free state is maintained? Could a cure be found by investigating reservoir animal hosts? Understanding the mechanism how reservoirs do not show any clinical symptoms like humans against these viruses may help us to find out what unique natural mechanism is contributing [9], [158], [159]. This type knowledge could lead us to shape the in vivo studies as well as improve the knowledge gap between in vitro and in vivo. But there are lots of challenges in studying the reservoir hosts under their natural condition and mimicking their natural habitat not only need huge logistic support but also involve great costs and thus there is a long way to achieve answers from reservoir hosts [158], [159], [160], [161]. Our work is restricted to understanding pathogenic events in humans. It is therefore not intended to explain the disease-free state of reservoir animal hosts.",

Under such a condition, our work has considered pathogenic events during multiple diseases in order to establish a sequential framework to find a possible nexus for metabolic regulation.
