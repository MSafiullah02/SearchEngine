One of the best-known families of these pattern recognition receptors is Toll Like Receptors (TLRs), present on the cell surface or endosomal membrane (Lester and Li 2014). Intracellular RIG-I-Like Receptors (RLRs) having common domains called caspase recruitment domain (CARD), helicase, and NACHT are RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene-I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation associated gene 5), Caterpillar, NOD, NALP, NAIP, and CIIT (Fitzgerald et al. 2014b).",

For instance, while Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication is extremely sensitive to the antiviral effect of pretreatment of neurons with IFN-\u03b2, VSV infection of dendritic cells rapidly induces IFN, it fails to elicit IFN-\u03b2 production in neurons (Trottier et al. 2005). The mechanism(s) by which IFNs alter cellular physiology to resist viral infection is distinct in neurons when compared to cell types that have been more frequently studied (D\u2019Agostino et al. 2009a, b; Chesler et al. 2003). VSV also evades cell-autonomous responses through one of many actions of the viral M protein, essentially preventing mRNA export from the nucleus (Faria et al. 2005). In mice, VSV infection elicits IFN-\u03b2 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in peripheral lymphoid compartments (Akira and Hemmi 2003), no detectable IFN-\u03b2 is made in the CNS during the first week of VSV encephalitis (Trottier et al. 2007). In contrast, both Theiler\u2019s encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and LaCrosse virus infections led neurons to produce Type I IFN (Delhaye et al. 2006). Both RIG-I and MDA5 are essential to detect and control WNV infection (Carty et al. 2014; Errett et al. 2013).",

            "text": "The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), an activating receptor, is expressed on many cells including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, monocytes, and microglia (Ramasamy et al. 2005). It was originally recognized as a contributor to the inflammation seen in diabetes, and binds, as its name suggests, proteins that have been posttranslationally modified with glucose. Engagement of RAGE by its ligands leads to signal transduction through NF-kB and synthesis of proinflammatory mediators, leading to neuroinflammation\nand oxidative stress (Tobon-Velasco et al. 2014). Other ligands for the receptor are S100 family proteins, HMGB1 and insoluble complexes of A\u03b2 peptide, which are released during tissue damage in arthritis, atherosclerosis, aging, neurodegeneration, pulmonary diseases, sepsis, and ischemia (Chuah et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2014). This has led to the classification of RAGE as a Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) receptor (Foell et al. 2007). Thus direct or indirect compromise of neurons and parenchymal cells during viral encephalitis leads to the release of HMGB1 (Wang et al. 2006) or S100 that can activate microglia, perivascular macrophages, and pericytes, as well as the microvascular endothelial cells (Jaulmes et al. 2006; Rong et al. 2005). Release of S100 or HMGB1 during VSV encephalitis did not contribute to the production of IFN-\u03b2 by splenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, since infusion of soluble RAGE did not suppress the response (Reiss and Schmidt, unpublished data). Thus, the BBB may be disrupted; cells within the CNS will secrete cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. This could be among the first of the sequential waves of innate immunity in response to the viral infection\n.",

HIV Vpu antagonizes tetherin via Ub-modification and degradation, and protecting cells from antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Arias et al. 2014). Glycoproteins of Filoviruses, HSV-1, Sendai, and SIV also block this pathway (Nikovics et al. 2012; Bampi et al. 2013; Zenner et al. 2013; Gnirss et al. 2014). SIV nef and HSV-2 Env mediate endocytosis of tetherin and intracellular sequestration (Serra-Moreno and Evans 2012). HHV-8 K5 ubiquitinates tetherin (Mansouri et al. 2009). CD317/tetherin is an important host cell glycoprotein found at lipid rafts, whose expression is enhanced by IFNs, and can retain budding viruses.",

In the CNS, NOS-1 is constitutively found in neurons, NOS-2 induced microglia and inflammatory macrophages, and NOS-3 constitutively in astrocytes, ependymal and endothelial cells (Reiss and Komatsu 1998). NO is not only involved in long-term potentiation in the CNS, it also contributes to regulation of blood flow (Murad 2006). Astrocytes and endothelial cells release NO, resulting in dilation of capillaries and increased local perfusion (Moore 2000).",

Among these molecules are Substance P, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP/PACAP), neurokinin1 (NK1), and \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) (Dantzer 2004; Brogden et al. 2005; Metz-Boutigue et al. 2003; Prod\u2019homme et al. 2006). NK1 and NPY are inflammatory and may have Defensin-like activity [Defensins are discussed below]. Others like VIP/PACAP are negative modulators, which act principally on dendritic cell induction of regulatory T cells (Delgado et al. 2006; Gonzalez-Rey et al. 2007). Thus, the impact of many neurotrophins, peptides, and neurotransmitters is by modulation of adaptive immune response, as has been seen with CMV (Li et al. 2013a) and HIV-1 infection (Souza et al. 2014).",

The receptors also regulate pain (Sawynok and Liu 2003). In HIV infection, these receptors have been shown to play an anti- inflammatory role (Gilbert et al. 2007). However, A1 receptors may also contribute to neutrophil infiltration, although this is antagonized by A2 receptors (Cronstein et al. 1992). Expression of A2B receptors is induced by HIF-1-\u03b1, a cytokine-inducible transcription factor (Kong et al. 2006). ATP, released by cells, can attract neutrophils to tissues via engagement of A3 and P2Y2 receptors. There is reciprocal modulation of cannabinoid receptor expression by adenosine (Carrier et al. 2006), thus signaling by one neurotransmitter can alter the response of neurons to other neurotransmitters. Cannabidiol was shown to be protective in inflammation during TMEV infection via regulation of A2A receptors (Mecha et al. 2013).",

Two serpentine 7-transmembrane receptors have been well described: CB1 expressed by neurons and CB2 expressed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system including microglia (Ullrich et al. 2007). The functions of these receptors are distinct, although the same signaling pathways are used; the serpentine 7-transmembrane receptor is G-protein coupled. These receptors (a) negatively regulate Ca2+ channels inhibiting Ca2+ release, (b) activate Raf-1, MEK, and ERK, as well as (c) adenyl cyclase which ultimately activates protein kinase A. The CB1 receptor is associated with hypothermia, immobility, euphoria, and hyperphagia, while the CB2 receptor is a negative regulator of monocyte and microglial activation, hence immuno-dampening. Thus selective receptor agonists can target either immune responses or neurons. However, this distinction is potentially murky when you consider the regulation of cell-autonomous innate immune responses to viral infections in neurons.",

In several models where inflammation contributes to pathology, such as TMEV, the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 ameliorates clinical disease (Croxford and Miller 2003); WIN 55 may also induce PGE2 production (Mestre et al. 2006). However, cannabinoids may contribute to syncytia formation in HIV-E (Noe et al. 1998), leading to pathology. In VSV infection of neuronal cells, activating the CB1 receptor leads to ~15-fold enhanced viral replication via inhibition of Ca2+-flux and thus impairing the activity of constitutive NOS-1 (Herrera et al. 2008). Therefore, there is no hard and fast rule about the impact of cannabinoid activity on viral infection [reviewed in (Reiss 2010)]. Caution is urged when considering use of these drugs; the effect(s) may be on reticuloendothelial cells or on neurons.",

In the presence of antibody, exacerbated C3-dependent pathology was observed in MHV-A59, TMEV, and Coxsackie B3 infections (Burrer et al. 2007).",

In this section, three classes of transcriptional factors will be described: Hypoxia-inducible factor, Peroxisome proliferation activating receptor, and High mobility group-1 protein. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a transcription factor whose expression is triggered by transient hypoxia (or ischemia/stroke); it induces the expression of a number of genes including defensins, the adenosine A2B receptor, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), COX-2, NOS-2, and NOS-3 (Kong et al. 2006; Hellwig-Burgel et al. 2005; Peyssonaux and Johnson 2004). VEGF regulates not only BBB permeability, but also angiogenesis. HIF-1\u03b1 expression can be induced by IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and possibly TLR agonists (Hellwig-Burgel et al. 2005; Argaw et al. 2006). It is expressed during inflammatory and demyelinating diseases (Aboul-Enein et al. 2003). In studies with viral vectors for oncolysis in the CNS, HIF-1\u03b1 expression was enhanced (Shen et al. 2006; Post et al. 2004). Thus, HIF-1\u03b1 expression, whether elicited by transient vascular compromise or cytokine expression, enhances the innate antiviral (and anti-bacterial) gene expression and may lead to increased BBB perfusion of the local area.",

However, HBV X-associated protein 2 complexes with PPAR and inactivates it (Sumanasekera et al. 2003), an evasive pathway.

Astrocytes regulate the perfusion of the parenchyma by controlling vasodilation of the cerebrovascular capillaries through the activity of NOS-3 (Sporbert et al. 1999; Komatsu et al. 1999b). The BBB is associated with the immune privilege of the brain and separates the CNS from peripheral circulation and immune surveillance that is characteristic of the periphery. Entry of cells requires adhesion to the brain microvascular endothelium, release of MMPs to degrade tight junctions and the extracellular matrix, as well as migration along a gradient of chemoattracting molecules (Bechmann et al. 2007; Arima et al. 2013). The chemoattracting molecules for circulating cells range from LTB4 to complement products, chemokines, cytokines, FLT3L, and even ATP (all discussed in the relevant sections, above).",

During immune responses in the CNS, it is possible to find cells expressing dendritic cell markers (Matyszak and Perry 1997; Ambrosini et al. 2005). In addition to any chemokines, Flt3L has been shown to recruit dendritic cells to the CNS (Curtin et al. 2006). Parenchymal dendritic cells have numerous phenotypes (D\u2019Agostino et al. 2012a), and VSV infection induces CD103+ CD11b+ cells (D\u2019Agostino et al. 2012b). Dendritic cell responses are age dependent and may contribute to the susceptibility of immature hosts to some forms of viral encephalitis (Taylor et al. 2014). However, the microenvironment during which dendritic cells are exposed to virus can determine whether pro-inflammatory or Treg responses are found (Durrant et al. 2013; Martinez et al. 2014).",

We tested whether chemical sympathectomy altered the ability of peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells to produce IFN-\u03b2 in response to VSV infection of the CNS, and found no contribution of innervation of secondary lymphoid organs in this response (Trottier et al. 2007).

Proinflammatory cytokines, induced during infections, can upregulate production of leptin (Yu et al. 2014), and lead to anorexia (Langhans 2000). Central leptin and insulin resistance has been associated with Adenovirus (SMAM-1 and Ad36) infection, leading to obesity (Wierucka-Rybak and Bojanowska 2014). Recent evidence suggests that this adipocyte-produced protein is also immunoregulatory and is, in fact, a proinflammatory cytokine (Lord 2006). Leptin is pathogenic in EAE (Matarese et al. 2002) by virtue of its action on dendritic cells, resulting in the induction of Th1 responses (Mattioli et al. 2005) and its inhibition of thymic apoptosis (Mansour et al. 2006). In experimentally induced obese mice, more severe influenza pathology was associated with leptin (Zhang et al. 2013a). Well-nourished infants, with elevated leptin levels, were more susceptible to Dengue hemorrhagic fever, than were thinner children (Libraty et al. 2014). High leptin levels were observed in HCV-infected people with chronic fatigue symptoms (El-Gindy et al. 2012). In contrast, low levels of leptin are observed in HIV infections, and exaggerated in those patients with lipodystrophy veloso (Veloso et al. 2012). Therefore, leptin may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in persistent inflammatory infections of the CNS such as HIV-E and Bornaviral disease.",

However, female mice undergo more severe demyelination in TMEV infections (Fuller et al. 2005). HIV-E and HIV-dementia incidence may be lower in females due to estrogen effects on immune responses (Wilson et al. 2006). Thus, where inflammation is beneficial to clearing virus and resolving infection, females are at an advantage. In contrast, where inflammation contributes to viral disease pathology in the CNS, females are disproportionately affected.",

These responses are highly regulated and are triggered, in part, by receptors that bind common pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecules. Combined, these responses provide a critical barrier, controlling viral replication until adaptive immune responses are marshalled. Inflammation is essential, but must be carefully controlled to prevent tissue damage and pathology. Virtually every pathway has regulation (e.g., kinases and phosphatases) that ultimately determines the magnitude and then the resolution of responses. We are still learning about the essential pathways and their controls, about how drugs may alter the dynamic equilibrium, and in which situations responses need to be ramped up or downregulated. Nonetheless, innate immune responses are critically essential in the central nervous system, to buy the host time for the adaptive immune response to mature and provide antigen-specific effector T cells and antibody to the viral infection. I predict we will make many future advances that will benefit the health of the populations who are infected with neurotropic viruses.",
