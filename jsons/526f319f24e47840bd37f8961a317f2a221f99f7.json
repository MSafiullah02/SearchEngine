Therefore, with strict quality control measures, one could effectively and safely reuse pMDIs [5] . Dunlew et al. took cultures from salbutamol pMDI nozzles before and after disinfection with an alcohol prep pad, as well as after administration [6] . Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in at least 5% of the cultures with all three types of specimens, including those taken after the nozzle was disinfected with an alcohol prep pad [6] . In an experiment by Hinson and Rau [7] , failure to wipe the canister nozzle with an alcohol prep pad before patient use in the hospital was assessed; one of 18 cultures (5.5%) resulted in the growth of Streptococci group D (Enterococci).",
