            "text": "Coronaviruses infect many animals, including humans, in a species-specific manner. Most coronaviruses in farm animals cause respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infections in young animals, resulting in huge economic losses (Saif, 2004a, Saif, 2004b, Stoddart et al., 1988, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). Several viruses in the family coronaviridae infect pigs, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Cartwright et al., 1969, Greig et al., 1962). TGEV mainly infects epithelial cells in the small intestine and causes fatal enteritis in piglets (Enjuanes et al., 1995). Additionally, TGEV replicates in porcine respiratory tract tissues but does not induce primary respiratory disease (Kemeny et al., 1975, Saif, 2004a, Saif, 2004b). PRCoV, a spontaneously occurring variant of TGEV, replicates more extensively in the respiratory tract without causing clinical signs (Wesley et al., 1991). It has been reported that PRCoV replicates in different types of lung cells, including alveolar, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells and in bronchoalveolar macrophages, but not in enterocytes (Cox et al., 1990).",

            "text": "PEDV is one of the major etiological agents of seasonal acute diarrhea in piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980). The pathology following PEDV infection resembles that of TGEV, which is mainly characterized by acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in suckling piglets (Hess et al., 1980, Pensaert et al., 1981, Takahashi et al., 1983). Based on these symptoms, the enterocytes have largely been thought of as the target cells of PEDV infection. Indeed, experimental infection with the prototype strain CV777 showed that replication in epithelial cells covering small and large intestinal villi resulted in villous atrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980). Similarly, Korean strains of PEDV caused severe villous atrophy in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of experimentally infected pigs (Kim and Chae, 2000, Kim and Chae, 2003). Replication was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon (Sueyoshi et al., 1995). Microscopically, marked cytoplasmic vacuolation and exfoliation of enterocytes with subsequent considerable shortening and fusion of villi were observed (Coussement et al., 1982, Pospischil et al., 1981). However, according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) results reported by Lee et al., PEDV antigens were detected not only in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes but also in macrophages that had infiltrated the lamina propria (Lee et al., 2000). PEDV infection in macrophages may reflect the possibility of widespread pathology or the presence of extra-gastrointestinal infection and replication, as observed in other species infected with coronaviruses (Gu et al., 2005). Most recent studies on the pathogenesis of PEDV have been limited to partial autopsies of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to identify pathogenesis in different organs or cell types was needed.",

Surprisingly, PEDV infection was detected not only in the small intestine, but also in the lung, liver, and kidney from one of the four piglets we tested (Table 1\n). To evaluate tissue damage, we stained sections with hematoxylin and eosin, and to detect PEDV antigens we performed IHC on these tissue samples. As shown in Fig. 1A, severe histopathological changes were observed in the small intestine, including villous atrophy, extensive vacuolation, and flattening of the villous enterocytes. Since the small intestines were severely damaged, most PEDV-positive cells were already detached and found in the lumen while PEDV was detected in a few enterocytes in the intestinal villi (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, PEDV was also detected in lung tissue by IHC, mostly in the mixed gland and epithelial cells, but not in the alveolar respiratory bronchiole (Fig. 1G). Despite this, we were unable to find significant pathological changes in the lung (Fig. 1B and G). Samples from the liver, kidney, and spleen were negative for PEDV as evaluated by IHC, and we were unable to find significant pathological changes (Fig. 1C, D, E, H, I, and J). Together, the results from RT-PCR and histology suggest that PEDV can replicate not only in the intestine but also in the lung.",

Until now, PEDV replication has not been reported in cells other than those of the intestinal tract, with the exception of a few studies that have reported PEDV infection in macrophages as well as enterocytes from the gastrointestinal tract (Lee et al., 2000). Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity of new wild-type PEDV in comparison with Vero cell-adapted KPEDV-9. We found that new wild-type PEDV, but not Vero cell adapted KPEDV-9 strain, can infect not only small intestines but also the respiratory tract, especially porcine alveolar macrophages. We are not so sure whether all the new PEDV wild type has same activity or not and this findings could be limited to this specific isolate. Further studies required with other isolates, but there is big limitation on new isolation. Genetic analyses suggest that the extra-intestinal tropism of wild-type PEDV might be obtained by natural mutations on PEDV S.",

In piglets naturally infected with wild-type PEDV, we observed that PEDV is able to infect not only in the small intestine but also other organs, including the lung. We further investigated this observation in piglets, which were experimentally inoculated with infected tissue homogenates and compared with piglets inoculated with Vero cell-adapted KPEDV-9. As with the piglets that were naturally infected with wild-type PEDV, the virus was detected in both small intestines and lungs of experimentally inoculated animals. Additionally, we found that lung infection of PEDV was associated with alveolar macrophages. These results indicate that PEDV replication in the lungs might be related to increased cellularity and partially owing to infiltration of macrophages into the alveolar and interalveolar septa.",

We found that both primary porcine alveolar macrophages and 3D4 cells were susceptible to PEDV and able to support PEDV replication. However, growth of Vero cell-adapted PEDV in 3D4 cells was relatively slow and inefficient compared with its growth in Vero cells. It is not clear why PEDV was unable to replicate as successfully in 3D4 cells as it does in Vero cells. Our sequencing results indicate that wild-type PEDV has differences in the N-terminal domain of its S protein sequences compared with other reference and Vero cell-adapted strains of PEDV. We propose that the changes in amino acids in the N-terminal domain may be involved in the observed tropism changes, and thus Vero cell-adapted PEDV strains may have lost their ability to infect alveolar macrophages. Similarly, PRCoV, a deletion mutant of TGEV with deletion of nucleotides 621\u2013681 in the S gene, is non-enteropathogenic and has a tropism for respiratory epithelium and alveolar macrophages (Sanchez et al., 1999). Although the growth curves and titers were different in 3D4 cells from those produced by infected Vero cells, the fact that the virus was able to grow at all suggests that macrophages may be another possible target for PEDV replication. It seems likely that the ability to induce pathogenesis might be largely dependent on the ability of the S protein to mediate entry into target cells.",

The same farms experienced repeated outbreaks and some farms were found to be positive for PEDV infection most of the time. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that alveolar macrophages may be susceptible to PEDV although they are probably not a primary replication site. Perhaps, when protective antibodies are generated by vaccination or infection, PEDV might escape into alveolar macrophages. As such, these cells might make a good target for persistence. We found many sows tested that confirmed positive for PEDV, as measured by RT-PCR of their lung samples, although they have never shown any of clinical signs of infection (personal observations). We also found many PEDV-positive cases from day-old piglet samples, as measured by RT-PCR. We can only explain these positive results from day-old piglet samples if the infection spread from sows during pregnancy or delivery. In summary, we hypothesize that alveolar macrophages are not the primary target or a common replication site for PEDV, but they are likely important for its survival and pathogenesis.",

However, further studies are still required to fully understand the mechanism of PEDV infection since our findings conflict with the previous understanding of PEDV replication sites and pathogenesis. Although we found some variations in sequence with other isolates, it remains unknown exactly where and what the critical factors are which cause these changes in its pathogenesis. Additional studies with other stains will be required to resolve these questions. In conclusion, our confirmation of PEDV lung infection provides a new perspective on the tropism of this virus and could be an important finding for the management of PEDV pathogenesis in pig farms.",
