In the absence of influenza epidemics, rhinoviruses account for \u223c30\u201350% of all respiratory illnesses annually.1 Other viruses commonly isolated in adults with respiratory symptoms are parainfluenza, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus.",

It is well known that physicians see only a small fraction of the health problems experienced by the population at large. In the Tecumseh Study, physician consultations were associated with only 25.4% of all respiratory illnesses.6 This suggested that the decision to consult GPs is not based solely on symptom complex or severity, especially for mild and self-limiting conditions such as URTI. Triggers ranging from self-perception to socio-economic factors can influence a person's decision to legitimize his sick role. Yet, in spite of this, recommendations for treatment of URTI in many clinical guidelines are based on results of community studies.",

Fever was not used as a criterion for patient selection as, in doing so, we may inadvertently have excluded patients with infective aetiology who did not have fever. Patients were excluded if they had history of chronic respiratory problems such as allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were currently on treatment for tuberculosis, or were immunocompromised in any way.
