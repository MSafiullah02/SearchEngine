Although some guidelines for patient care in 7 orthopaedic practice have been published, overall, publications focusing exclusively on 8 guidelines on starting orthopaedic outpatient departments (OPD) after the COVID-19 lockdown 9 amidst the on-going pandemic are lacking. We hereby propose the evolving knowledge in 10 changes in OPD management practices for orthopaedic surgeons in the COVID-19 era. The 11 emphasis on online registration (e-registration) should be given impetus and become the new 12 norm supplemented by telephonic and spot registration for the uneducated patients. The review 13 highlights the safety of patient and orthopaedic surgeons in OPD by screening and maintaining 14 hygiene at various levels. 15 The article also mentions the duties of the help desk, OPD hall supervisor and the new norms of 16 Air Conditioning, ventilation, safe use of elevators, sanitization of OPD premises and biomedical 17 waste disposal. The optimum and safe utilization of human & material resources, DO's and 18 DON'Ts for patients & health staff have also been proposed. The reorganization of plaster room, 19 the precaution during plastering, fracture clinic, dressing and injection room services are 20 discussed as per evolving guidelines. This article will give deep insight into the OPD plan 21 &telemedicine graphically also. 22 The authors suggest updating and downward permeation of existing e-infrastructure of 23 government health services that is up-gradation of existing tertiary level online registration 24 services, a paperless model of OPD Consultation & dispensation.

In India, the number of active patients infected with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is 47 41472 with 2109 deaths.[1] Till 10th May 2020 total number of cases infected Worldwide with 48 Corona Virus is 4,122,994, out of which 1,451,630 recovered and 280,882 died of which 2019 49 deaths were reported from India with a death rate of 3.35 %[1,4] The high infectivity rate of 50COVID-19 has not only created a health emergency in most parts of the world but overwhelmed 51 the existing health system of all countries alike. To avoid such a situation and to contain its52 3 spread Social lockdown and Isolation being practiced by India and most countries and it is the 53 best prophylactic measure. The impact of the pandemic is so colossal that in these times all 54 medical specialities have ceased to exist and there remains only one speciality and that is 55 \"COVID doctors''. In affirmation of the new role orthopaedic surgeons were and are manning 56 frontline COVID-19 duties, but post easing of lockdown measures they will have to increase 57 their outpatient dispensation (which are already running meagerly with limitations in time and 58 census) to bring orthopaedic healthcare on track to pre-COVID era. Considering the fact that 69 59 percent of COVID -19 patients are asymptomatic, its highly infectious nature and realizing that 60 the disease may remain in society for a longer period of time, it is imperative that the Outpatient 61 Department follows standard and universal operating protocols, so as not to lose the health gains on PubMed using advanced feature and using strategy: [#1COVID 19, #2 Orthop*, #3 65 Outpatient, Final #4 (#1 AND #2 AND #3)] revealed only 13 papers. A similar search on Scopus 66 and Cochrane library did not reveal any extra papers. After screening titles, abstracts and full 67 texts, we selected 6 relevant papers for inclusion in this review. [6-11](Figure 1). Besides these, 68 we also considered guidelines provided by established Indian national (like Indian Council of 69 Medical Research (ICMR), Emergency Medical Relief (EMR), National Centre for Disease 70 Control (NCDC) and Ministry of Health &Family Welfare (MHFW), Government of India 71 (GOI))and International/External Bodies(like World Health Organization-WHO, Centers for 72 Disease Control -CDC). Although some guidelines have been provided and experiences shared, 73 overall, we could not find any paper focusing exclusively on guidelines/ experience on starting 74 OPD after the COVID-19 lockdown, amidst the ongoing pandemic. This issue has become even 75 more important in the present time, as the lockdown opens. After reviewing all these papers and 76 guidelines, we hereby outline the evolving knowledge regarding changes in outpatient practices 77 for orthopaedic surgeons in tertiary care centers amidst Covid19 pandemic.

They should enter singularly to avoid overcrowding in the 207 designated waiting hall/area. The entry of caregivers should be limited and the only patient is 208 to be allowed into the OPD, but if needed one attendant (preferably legal guardian in case of 209 a minor and functionally impaired patient) be allowed to enter in the OPD with all 210 precautions of wearing mask, proper hand sanitization and CCCATT clearance.211 An intercom facility with the reception should be provided at the entry gate, this helps in case of 212 digital-uneducated, functionally impaired or poor patients who have not been able to register 213 online or by other means; may be registered by the MBBS doctor on calling the reception. They 214 can book a time slot of that day (if some appointment is cancelled) or some other day with the 215 receptionist; hence a 2% buffer of such patients should be allowed without disturbing the load of 216 the number of patients per doctor. This should be rare rather than common. The documents or 217 investigation reports of such patients can be photo-digitized and transferred to reception with no218 9 touch technique by the doctor at the gate. No documents, folder or investigation should be 219 allowed inside. (Patients in an hour will be approximately 30 of which 20 can be allowed as per 220 the size of waiting hall maintaining 1-meter social distance or 2-3 empty seats in between and the 221 rest can wait outside in their private vehicle if possible).[5] 222 Two trolleys and wheelchair duly sanitized by 1% hypochlorite solution with hospital attendant 223 (PPE -as above since they may have to bring unscreened patients from the vehicle and be the 224 first contacts) should be kept ready at the gate behind temporary glass/plastic partitions for nonthe reception 2 medical data operator and a helper located 1 meter apart, wearing a triple-228 layered medical mask and Latex examination gloves are seated behind an easily cleaned smooth 229 tabletop counter with glass partitions. At the OPD reception, the patient should first show his 230 virtual time allotment/ e-registration slip so that the reception staff can retrieve his form and 231 uploads for forwarding to the doctor. Besides this the receptionist have to complete and forward 232 forms of patients who have done spot registration via intercom at the entry gate. Its duty of 233 reception/help desk-OPD staff to arrange the digital documents of the online appointments and 234 of registrations done through Aarogya Setu app and helpline( transferred by central hospital 235 portal) a day in advance. After further ensuring that the patient is wearing a proper face mask 236 above his nostrils, he/she should be directed to the designated OPD room/clinic or in the waiting 237 hall. 238 239 WAITING OUTSIDE OPD ROOM/ CLINIC 240 Each OPD room should always have a paramedical staff stationed at its door with mini PPE; 241 these staff should be allowed to work in shifts of 6hours. The paramedic at this stage will check 242 again the CCCATTT status, and ensure that the patient is wearing a triple-layered mask. The 243 patient's hand should be sanitized with 60-80 %alcohol solution before entry in the room. [12] At 244 this point only the patient should be allowed and in only exceptional circumstances (e.g. for non-245 ambulatory patients) one attendant may be allowed into the OPD with a face mask and hand 246 sanitization. The patient and his attendant should be asked to maintain social distancing. [13] 247 OPD WAITING CENTRAL HALL 248 In OPD waiting area hand hygiene station should be installed, television (TV) screens should be 249 installed to educate the people regarding signs and symptoms of COVID 19, hand hygiene, how 250 to wear and make a homemade mask, social distancing, not to worry videos, and prevention & 251 treatment of coronavirus, do's and don'ts and other health education videos. The OPD waiting 252 hall should have a minimum number of furniture and instruments and that too should be 253 adequately spaced. It is necessary to convert OPD air conditioner into a non-circulatory system 254 this can be done by blocking off the return air vents of the air conditioner; additionally, an 255 independent exhaust blower shall be installed to extract the room air [14]; the HEPA filter 256 (HEPA filters shall be a minimum of H13 (EN1822-1) filter class or equivalent) of AC should be 257 approved by the concerned authorities according to the norms. The OPD Hall should have a 258 Trained floor supervisor (paramedic/support staff) who has two I's as duties (a) infection 259 control-to ensure social distancing (1m), no crowding, seats are properly spaced, and the OPD 260 furniture and floor including computers, screens and keyboards are properly sanitized daily 3 261 hourly (twice in a shift of 6 hours) or earlier in inadvertent spillage and (b) Health Information-262 ensuring that patient information video and displays are running properly. 263 There should be a security staff stationed in the OPD Hall for the help of patients and health 264 staff. The toilets should be frequented one at a time, properly sanitized with 1% hypochlorite 265 solution after every patient visit, and so should the drinking water facility by maintaining social have ready access to fill online forms and uploaded documents of patients on270 computer duly forwarded by receptionists. After seeing them the patient is called by a bell or 271 patient digital display board or a single health staff operated token number system. The 272 paramedic at doorstep should allow the patient whose consultation is complete to exit first and 273 give an interval time of 3-5 minutes for doctors to get sanitized -ready before allowing the other 274 patient inside the doctors' room. The bed sheet of the examination couch and anything contacted 275 by a patient should be sanitized as per above norms. 276 Doctor and all staff in OPD must wear PPE kit (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ orthopaedician) 277 consisting of triple-layer medical mask and Latex examination gloves. No aerosol-generating 278 procedure (AGP) should be performed in OPD. Doctor and other staff should perform hand 279 hygiene using proper technique [15] and according to instruction known as My 5 moment of 280 hand hygiene [16] before donning and doffing of this mini PPE. Patients should be seated at a 281 distance of one meter and should be examined by a doctor swiftly behind a plastic curtain. The 282 patients' body part may be cleaned by soap solution/spirit before examination at the table station 283 discussed in the model above (Fig. 3). Before and after each patient's examination doctor should 284 sanitize his hand with prescribed alcohol sanitizer and change gloves after every examination. 285 The female patient may be examined in the presence of a sister with the above PPE. Only the 286 digital-uneducated patients may be given OPD prescription slips by the doctor. 287 DIAGNOSTICS AND PRESCRIPTION 288 The prescription and diagnostic test ordered may be paperless (as far as possible) with 289 prescription emailed to the patient or sent by an app and to the hospital laboratory services. The 290 investigations should be written which are essential for a particular patient. As the x rays & 291 diagnostic films can be the source of infection it should not be handled. The hospital should have 292 or develop a server / Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) so that imaging and 293 investigative procedures are available online to the orthopaedician. Teleradiology may be used 294 for x rays, MRI and CT scan services. If PAC services are in developing stage, X Rays 295 prescribed by doctors should be done hand to hand, this will limit the further visit of patients to 296 the hospital for collection of films/reports and brought by staff (not patient) with due COVID 297 precautions. Entry to the diagnostic facilities in house should be separate and all precautions as 298 above in an OPD should be taken. 299 Patients should be prescribed a safe and longest possible period of medicine to avoid frequent 300 visits to the hospital, with monitoring of adverse events to be done by teleconsultation as far as 301 possible. Patients should be given health facility number in case of emergency and should be 302 encouraged for teleconsultation for future problems. This requires developing or updating an 303 integrated hospital computer network with a fast server-broadband, robust secure bandwidth, 304 enabling access to the patient investigations done in the hospital. Pharmacy in house should 305 follow the same precautions as OPD and PPE recommended for pharmacists is triple layer 306 medical mask, latex examination gloves and frequent sanitization over gloves. Health Organization defines telemedicine as \"The delivery of health-care services, 310 where distance is a critical factor, by all health-care professionals using information and 311 communications technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and 312 prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and the continuing education of 313 health-care workers, with the aim of advancing the health of individuals and communities.\" A 314 telemedicine visit has the advantage that it can be conducted without exposing the staff to 315 COVID, and thus reducing the risks to both health care workers and patients. It can provide rapid 316 access to medical practitioners, who are not immediately available, thus achieving the goal of 317 quality care to all. In addition, it makes available extra working hands for providing physical 318 care at the respective health institutions. The CDC has also recommended changing outpatient 319practice patterns and specifically, they advise to \"reduce unnecessary healthcare visits\" and 320 \"explore alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits.\" A major challenge during this crisis is to 321 keep patients and the healthcare team safely distant while providing patients with effective and 322 efficient care and Telemedicine is a logical solution to help address this challenge. Thus, health 323 systems that are invested in telemedicine are well-positioned to ensure that with Covid-19 324 patients/suspects and those in containment zones also receive the timely care they need.[7, 9, 17]    325",

The physiotherapist should wear the same protection kit as 446 worn above by an orthopaedician. Additional precautions that need to be followed are a) Patients 447 coming for different physiotherapy modalities to be designated to specific rooms at reception to448 avoid crowding in the corridor/waiting hall. (b) In the physiotherapy section a maximum of 4-5 449 patients may be allowed for electrotherapy, rehabilitation advice while ensuring adequate 450 adequate personnel distancing.

The hospital portal may use artificial intelligence technology to automatically suggest to him the OPD he needs to visit for his complaint on filling the form, or a patient can take help from the General Toll-Free Helpline of the hospital to ask for the department he should visit.We propose that the hospital should give Online Time Slots of 1 hour with a gap of 20 minutes; the time of which can vary from OPD to OPD as Physio-Therapy and Rehabilitation OPD will require more time for patient consultation and management. This avoids overcrowding and the buffer intervening time allows for some overshooting of patient-doctor consultation and may be used for sterilizing the OPD premises.

POP should be the favourite material and fiber-resin cast should be avoided as they will need cutting with plaster cutting saw though a slab of synthetic material may be used.
