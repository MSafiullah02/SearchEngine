In this context, new services must be created to offer QoE-aware VoD services to mobile users, while optimizing the usage of heterogeneous network resources. For instance, VoD providers can run part of VoD services in the cloud in a more cost-effective fashion, but with higher values of latency for a stationary user with low QoE requirements. However, VoD providers migrate part of the VoD content to a fog node granting low latency with the high monetary cost for a mobile user with high QoE requirements. Hence, an efficient content orchestrator mechanism must periodically monitor network and user requirements, in order to select the most suitable node in the multi-tier fog environment for a user to access the VoD content, providing QoE assurance and efficient usage of network resources.",

The analysis phase collects information from multi-tier fog nodes and QoE from the mobile user to understand their behaviors/availabilities to keep the QoE high, while optimizing usage of network and cloud resources. Decision-making & execution phase finds the best node in the multi-tier fog environment to distribute the VoD service for each user request by using a multi-criteria technique. This phase is also responsible for forwarding a content request to such fog node. Some investigations deal with content orchestrator mechanisms for VoD services [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . However, network conditions continuously change over time. Previous works are limited to select a fog node only at the streaming startup and often neglect QoE information. It is mandatory for such mechanism to efficiently and periodically classify the best fog nodes to disseminate the content. This classification must consider different metrics to understand the performance of fog nodes and users to make efficient decisions. In this sense, it must consider the trade-offs between network conditions, QoE, and costs for decision making.",

We consider a network infrastructure to enable the cooperation between multi-tier fog and cloud nodes to meet user needs for VoD services. In this sense, we introduce a multi-tier fog architecture for VoD services with layered components used to implement Fog4Video in two phases. For the analysis phase, the Fog4Video collects information about available bandwidth, delay, stall duration, number of stall events, and monetary cost from the network, user client, and fog node. For the decision-making & execution phase, Fog4Video considers the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to assign different degrees of importance for each criterion. Therefore, Fog4Video selects the suitable fog node to stream VoD content cached on it, improving the QoE of delivered videos. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of Fog4Video in transmitting VoD compared to additional content orchestrator mechanisms. The number of stall events is reduced by up to 70%, and the stall duration is reduced by up to 65%. This behavior is an essential achievement of Fog4Video since stall duration and stall events cause the most negative impact on user perception than bitrate switching [17] . Fog4Video also improved the average bitrate by up to 35% and reduced monetary cost by up to 24% compared to other content orchestrator mechanisms.",

We also identify gaps in the literature, leading to design a content orchestrator mechanism in multi-layered and distributed fog systems. Byers et al. [6] propose a multi-tier architecture for several use cases, such as transportation, smart cities, and residential customers. The closer availability of content enhances delivery of video content in specific regions improving the network by reducing the network load and absolute latency. Khattak et al. [18] present a vehicular fog computing architecture for infotainment applications and evaluates in terms of cache size, cache hit ratio and energy of the vehicular fog nodes. Ros\u00e1rio et al. [19] describe the operational impacts and advantages regarding video content migration in a multi-tier architecture with QoE support. Iotti et al. [20] analyze the effect of proactive cache into fog nodes on the network edge to avoid redundant traffic. They classify and identify the manageable traffic based on DNS queries and replies. However, these works mostly provide optimizations lowering latency but lack in coordinating the content orchestrator to more efficient fog nodes in cases of poor QoE delivery.",

Zhang et al. [11] propose content placement and request dispatching for cloud-based video distribution services with Markov decision process aiming to maximize profits of the video service provider considering cost and also correlating QoS with QoE.

NS-3.29 implements the protocol stack for communication between the mobile device and the network infrastructure to reach the VoD service provider. For the wired infrastructure, we considered the partial topology of the FIBRE testbed [19] to set delays of the long-haul communication between fog nodes and the cloud. We distributed the multi-tier fog nodes organized into three fog tiers and one cloud level. In tier 3, there is an edge server with an Wi-FI AP in a local datacenter with resource availability of 10 Mbps for transcoding. In tiers 1 and 2, there is a regional data center with resource availability of 20 Mbps for transcoding, each. In the cloud, there is a powerful datacenter with a resource availability of 100 Mbps for transcoding. Figure 2 shows the delay of long-haul communication between cloud and tiers. For the wireless infrastructure, we consider Wi-Fi 802.11n APs, channel bonding of 40 MHz in the center of a square area of 50 m 2 providing access to 40 randomly distributed mobile devices. The mobile devices followed a linear continuous video request rate of 10 requests per second. By default, the video streaming initiates from the cloud node while the Orchestrator becomes aware of the QoE/QoS metrics of each client, such as stalling and delay. The adaptation algorithm is rate-based, where the bit rate starts from the lowest value and, for smoothing between each quality level, switches one level at a time following a conservative bit rate switching profile. The Video Player buffers at least 2000 ms, which is the size of a chunk. Therefore, as soon as the buffer does not have content to render (i.e., stalling event), it has to re-buffer a complete chunk to play out the video again. We considered the Big Buck Bunny, Sunflower version video downloaded from the video library [33] . The Video Player at the client requests a video at a given time. Precisely, we use a High Definition video with a duration of 600 seconds, configured with 30 frames per second, and encoded into eight common used bitrates of 400, 650, 1000, 1500, 2250, 3400, 4700 and 6000 kbps [19] , as shown in Table 4 . QoE metrics overcome the limitation of QoS metrics to capture aspects of VoD related to the human perception [34] . In this way, we apply wellknown QoE metrics for VoD services, namely bit rate, bit rate switch events, number, and duration of stalls [2] . Due to the conservative behavior of the adaptation algorithm, we consider the first 20 chunks as the initial bitrate since the first chunk always starts with the lowest bitrate, the last 20 chunks for the final bitrate, and average bitrate of all the chunks. Depending on the content orchestrator, a fog node, chosen with the best QoE and cost improvement potential, can reply to most of the requests. We consider the Jain Fairness index F to express the concentration of requests [35] to measure requests fairness between fog nodes for each mechanism. The index calculation is denoted in Eq. 11, where x i means the number of requests in fog node F k .",

Then, we analyze their impact to deliver VoD content with QoE support and provide a 95% confidence interval. All mechanisms leverage the resource availability of the fog nodes. The Random strategy chooses the fog nodes with equal chances among all of them. The Greedy mechanism selects the fog node owning the smallest delay. Fog4Video evaluates the collected metrics to choose the best serving fog node, such as explained in Section 3. Figure 3 shows the number of clients per tier for each individual chunk, i.e., tier 3, tier 2, tier 1, and cloud. This analysis provides information about the fog node selection behavior of each content orchestrator and from each tier the chunks were requested along the video playback. By analyzing the results, it is possible to conclude that all the clients start requesting the video from the cloud. Afterwards, each mechanism selects the Streaming Unit for the client to download the video in different ways. For instance, the Random strategy selects the tiers with a 25% probability, since it is one tier between four candidates. On the other hand, the Greedy mechanism prefers to select nodes with lower latency but picks the remaining tiers due to the resource availability in each tier. Finally, Fog4Video selects the appropriate Streaming Unit based on network, fog node, user information, and cost, leading to higher use of tier 2 and the cloud. Tier 2 has the same cost as tier 1, but the delay is better in tier 2, leading a more significant share. Tier 3 usage grows gradually before the 15th chunk because the bitrates of all clients are small in the beginning. When the bitrate grows, the clients move to other tiers capable of adapting the content as requested. In the last 15 chunks, the download of some clients finish, and other clients start to request from more cost effective tiers. Figure 4 depicts the costs for VoD service deployment C k for different content orchestrator mechanisms. By analyzing the costs, it is possible to conclude that Fog4Video reduces the cost by up to 24.04% and 16.32% compared to Greedy and Random, respectively. Fog4Video provides lower costs because it selects closer and more expensive tiers only when poor QoE is detected, despite the others mechanisms. On the other hand, Greedy and Random strategies do not follow this approach. In the last two cases, Greedy decides for the nodes with the lowest delays representing a closer distance between fog nodes and clients. However, this decision incurs higher costs. The Random strategy has lower costs because of the lower number of clients requesting from the more expensive tier. Greedy Random Figure 4 : Cost to Deploy VoD Services Figure 5 shows the bitrate initial, final, and average bitrates received by the client downloading the video via different content orchestrator mechanisms, i.e., Fog4Video, Greedy, and Random. The video starts with a lower bitrate, i.e., 400 kbps, regardless of the mechanism. We can also see that Fog4Video delivered the final bitrate up to 19.3% and 27.9% higher than Greedy and Random, respectively. The higher bitrate occurs because Fog4Video chooses the best Streaming Unit based on metrics like delay combined with QoE. The lower delay allows the adaptation algorithm to better predict the network conditions between the client and fog node with more frequent and updated information. Moreover, Fog4Video provides more fairness between the clients, giving a better opportunity to clients with worse QoE indicators, as shown in Figure 6 . The fairness allows the clients to have more room to increase their bitrate and thus to have a better bitrate than the clients using Greedy and Random mechanisms. However, AHP needs around 15 chunks to evaluate the performance of each tier resulting in lower initial bitrate for Fog4Video. Finally, the average bitrate delivered by Fog4Video is 30.91% and 35.05% higher than provided by Greedy and Random mechanisms, respectively. The average is higher because Fog4Video has a short period to adapt and converge. In this case, the clients can request better bitrates earlier, when compared to those clients using Greedy and Random, giving them a better overall bitrate.",

The index shows the concentration of requests set by the mechanisms. The Random mechanism is the fairest because the probability to choose a tier is equal between all of them. However, this performance does not result in better QoE or cost-effective results by the mechanism. In this sense, Fog4Video offers the best tradeoff between application performance and fairness, achieving a high score on the fairness index while cost-effectively improving QoE. Fog4Video decides to allocate requests to fog nodes with more potential to enhance QoE, and the fairness stands because of the usage of cheaper fog nodes. Moreover, the Greedy mechanism has a worse performance because it concentrates the requests to the closest servers even though it does not necessarily reflect in better QoE. Figure 7 shows the number of stalls and their duration per client for videos delivered by each content orchestrator mechanism. Fog4Video reduces the number of stall events by 71.44% and 71.18% compared to Greedy and Random mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, Fog4Video reduces the duration of stall events by 72.45% and 65.23% compared to Greedy and Ran- Greedy Random Figure 6 : Fairness Index dom mechanisms, respectively. These metrics have a significant influence on QoE, where high values could result in the viewer most likely leaving the video service. The interruption is a direct consequence of buffer starvation at the player, which is caused by poor network conditions, i.e., long delay, between the client and the Streaming Unit. By analyzing the results, we can see that Fog4Video delivered videos for 40 clients with less than one stall per client. For example, around 16 clients experienced a single stall during the Video Player, which lasted about 0.68 seconds. The reduced number of stalls happens because Fog4Video proactively selects the best Streaming Unit based on network, fog node, and user information. The QoE metrics played an essential role in identifying how a fog node can potentially improve the user's satisfaction. On the other hand, the Greedy and Random mechanisms selected the Streaming Unit without considering such metrics, which do not avoid overloaded Streaming Unit for video delivery.",

Fog4Video is executed in fog nodes organized in multi-tier between the cloud (at the top) and the mobile devices (at the bottom) to provide VoD services. Fog4Video provided better QoE regarding a VoD use case compared to delay based mechanisms. Fog4Video considers available delay, number of stalls, stalls duration, and cost to deploy VoD services in a given tier. The information of fog nodes and clients served as inputs for the AHP method to compute the influence factor for each parameter. From this, Fog4Video properly decided from which fog tier a better VoD provision with a lower overall cost can be achieved. From our evaluation analysis, we identified that Fog4Video delivered videos with an up to 30% QoE improvement compared to other content orchestrator mechanisms. The number of stall events reduces by up to 70%, and the stall duration reduced by up to 65%. These results are an essential achievement of Fog4Video since stall duration, and stall events significantly minimize the most detrimental factors that affect user perception. Fog4Video also improved average bitrate by up to 35% and reduced monetary cost by up to 24% compared to other content orchestrator mechanisms. Hence, simulation results show sufficient QoE assuring user's satisfaction in the use case of VoD. For future works, the content orchestrator mechanism can consider the migration of the content to the fog nodes. This way, the prefetch of most popular videos and their representations would imply storage and transmission costs between caches and links of the fog nodes. These costs could guide the selection of the best fog nodes to cache more representations of the same video and avoid frequent transcoding. Besides saving transcoding costs, fewer redundant transmissions in the backhaul could provide better QoE. Moreover, we can consider additional QoS metrics to collect more accurate information about network conditions, such as jitter and packet loss.",
