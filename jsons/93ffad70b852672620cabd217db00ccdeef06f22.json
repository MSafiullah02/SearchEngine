Oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy (a-interferon, Kaletra [lopinavir/ritonavir]), immunoenhancement therapy (thymosin), prevention of bacterial infection, relieving cough eliminating phlegm, and nutritional support were commonly used for all of the 46 patients; while, 26 of them received extra low-dose methylprednisolone treatment with the dosage of 1-2 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days via intravenous injection. The specific dosage and duration of methylprednisolone for the patients were determined according to the clinical manifestations, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, inflammatory index, and lesion range. There was no significant difference of age, sex, comorbidities, clinical, or laboratory parameters between the two groups (Supplementary Data Table S1 ).",

Moreover, patients without methylprednisolone treatment had significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy than those with methylprednisolone treatment (8 days [interquartile range (IQR) 7-10] vs. 14 days (IQR 10-16); P < 0.001). Regarding the most intense level of oxygen support, the patients who received methylprednisolone treatment were less likely to be developed to receive the mechanical ventilation (P = 0.05); 35% (7/20) patients without methylprednisolone treatment developed to receive the mechanical ventilation (5 non-invasive ventilator [NIV], 2 IMV [invasive ventilator], no IMV with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)); while only 11.5% (3/26) patients with methylprednisolone treatment developed to receive the mechanical ventilation (2 NMV, 1 IMV, no IMV with ECMO).",

In our experience, once the secondary infection occurs in severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, sensitive and full-dose antibacterial drugs should be immediately added. Secondly, the use of immune regulators (human immunoglobulin) can enhance the patients' immune function. In our experience, human immunoglobulin was usually used in the critical patients with a dosage of 10-20 g/day for 7-10 days as the pulse therapy. Thirdly, thymosin secreted by thymic epithelial cells can promote the maturation of T-lymphocytes and regulate function of cellular immunity. We suggest using thymosin during hospitalization, and the course of treatment can be determined according to the results of lymphocyte test. Benefiting from condition monitoring and refined management, no serious methylprednisolone treatment-induced complications were observed in the present cohort.",
