            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is associated with infectious agents and often complicated by stress factors including environmental, nutrition, transportation, and commingling with cattle of mixed origins and multiple herd sources [1], [2]. Infectious agents considered in the etiologies of BRD include viruses: bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3V), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine adenoviruses (BAV), and bovine coronaviruses (BoCV) and bacteria, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma spp. [1], [2]. For many years, BHV-1, PI-3V, BRSV, and BVDV were the viruses most associated with the viral etiology of BRD. In contrast, BoCV was associated with neonatal enteric disease and winter dysentery of adult cattle [3], [4], [5]. Recently BoCV as a respiratory infection and disease has received attention and has been the subject of multiple reviews [6], [7].",

            "text": "BoCV are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive sense single stranded RNA viruses that are grouped as a species within the Coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family [8]. BoCV virions contain a large surface glycoprotein referred to as the spike or S protein, an integral membrane protein (M), a small membrane protein (E), a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE) and a nucleocapsid protein (N). While strong humoral responses are elicited against the S, M, N and HE proteins following natural infection, the predominant antigens involved in virus neutralization are located in the S and HE proteins. Various studies have segregated the Coronavirus genus into groups based on several criteria, including; position and variation of non-structural proteins in the 3\u2032 end of the genome, antigenic cross reactivity, processing of the S protein and host range. However, there are no set guidelines for defining new Coronavirus species or differentiating subgroups within existing species. As stated above BoCV were initially associated with outbreaks of enteric disease. More recently, BoCV have been associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and in cattle pulled for treatment in the feedlot as well as from healthy cattle in numerous studies in the U.S. In these studies BoCV was identified by virus isolation from nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serotests detecting seroconversions indicating exposure to BoCV in outbreaks of BRD and inapparent infections [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. BoCV have been identified in pneumonic lungs from field cases, often in combination with other viruses and bacteria including Mycoplasma spp. [20], [21], [22]. Experimentally BoCV have caused respiratory tract lesions affecting the epithelium of the turbinates, trachea, and lungs [23]. Based on the observation of two different presentations following BoCV exposure, it has been suggested there is a dual tropism by BoCV for respiratory and digestive tracts of cattle [23], [24].",

There are three inactivated vaccines licensed to control of neonatal enteric disease and these are used in pregnant cows/heifers during pregnancy to stimulate humoral immunity for passive immunization of the newborn calf [7], [25]. There is a modified live virus vaccine containing BoCV for administration orally to the newborn calf to provide an active immune response to protect the calf against enteric disease [7], [25]. There are no licensed BoCV vaccines in the U.S. to protect against BRD, nor have effectiveness of the licensed enteric BoCV vaccines been determined for protection against BRD with BoCV challenge. However there is one U.S. report using the MLV vaccine containing BoCV that reduced treatment for BRD [26]. The methods of protection as correlates of immunity were not determined however [9]. To provide optimal immunity, vaccine antigens should be as similar as possible to the circulating viruses. It appears important that the virus or viruses used as immunogens to control BoCV BRD should align antigenically and genetically with the BoCV circulating in the field.",

All cattle were test negative for BVDV by ear notch immunohistochemistry using skin samples. These calves were auction market purchased calves that were commingled at the auctions and transported to the OSU WSBRC where they were processed receiving identification and MLV vaccines containing BHV-1, PI-3V, BVDV1a, BVDV2a, and BRSV immunogens. Nasal swabs and in some cases bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected at processing. Sample collections were repeated at weekly times up to 14 days. [19]. The cattle were placed in pens and a representative [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] group for each study monitored as sentinels. Cattle that were treated for BRD were sampled as well as the sentinel calves. Blood was collected at processing for serums as well as convalescent sera at \u226556 days after arrival. There were in some instances multiple positive BCV samples from the same animal, either from NS and BAL or from sequential collections. In addition NS collected during an OSU study (OSU-6) for a viral challenge study unrelated to BoCV were included in this study. Similarly, nasal swab samples collected from southeastern U.S. sourced cattle that were commingled and delivered to a research facility and monitored for BRD from studies in 1999 (OSU-7) and 2000 (OSU-8) were included. All studies were approved by the OSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#VM0818 and #VM0819).",

USA, Valencia, CA). A 10 \u03bcl aliquot of the extracted RNA was amplified using the primer set published by Kanno et al. [33]. The 1194 nucleotide section of the S protein gene that was amplified included the polymorphic region of the S protein gene that was used for phylogenetic analysis in previous studies of Coronavirus\n[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Amplification was confirmed based on size of amplicon as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons were purified and concentrated using a Geneclean Spin Kit per manufacturers instructions (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio) followed by quantification using the Pico Green assay for ds DNA (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and the appropriate quantity of dsDNA was labeled in both directions using Big Dye terminator chemistries (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled products were sequenced using an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing both strands and all sequencing reactions were run in duplicate. Sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencher 4.2 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).

Clade 1 was composed of reference strains associated with enteric disease and a vaccine strain from a multivalent vaccine for the prevention of scours in calves. Clade 2 was composed of the BoCV field strain panel assembled for this study and reference strains associated with respiratory disease or winter dysentery.

They hypothesized that BoCV were evolving over time and may be diverging from an enteric tropism to a dual respiratory and enteric tropism. Similarly, Kanno et al. compared the S protein coding sequences from 55 BoCV collected in Japan from 1999 to 2000 to reference strains [33]. They concluded that these 55 isolates had distinctive genetic divergence from the prototype enteric BoCV strains (Mebus, Quebec, Kakegawa, F15 and LY138). The study reported herein expands on these observations. In addition to comparing S protein coding sequences of recent U.S. isolates to reference strains, we have also compared these strains to a vaccine strain and have conducted an antigenic comparison using convalescent sera from cattle exposed to BoCV. Our results suggest that BoCV strains currently circulating in the U.S., similar to recent Japanese and Korean strains, are divergent from prototype BoCV strains isolated, in some cases 50 to 60 years ago. Further, there are antigenic differences between these more recent strains and a prototype strain Mebus. These results are consistent with a divergence of BoCV over time. Whether this divergence is associated with an increased tropism for respiratory tissue resulting in an increased association with respiratory disease is a matter for future study. Differences in cell tropism, that result in different clinical presentations, have been observed with other coronaviruess. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are both pathogens of swine that co-circulate in swine herds [36], [37]. TGEV replicates primarily in the enteric tract and PRCV replicates almost exclusively in the respiratory tract. In the case of porcine coronaviruses, changes in cell tropism are associated with variations of the S gene. It appears that PRCV may be a deletion mutant of TGEV [38]. In comparison to TGEV, PRCV has a large deletion in the 5\u2032 region of the S gene and minor deletions in genes 3/2a and 3\u20131/3b [39]. It is theorized, based on studies using TGEV mutants, that mutations located in the S gene affect tissue tropism and virulence [40], [41].",

This diversity points out the need to determine if potential immunizations provide broad range of protection to these heterologous BoCV. Another point is that these cattle in the OSU1-5 studies were found to be shedding viruses at arrival or short after arrival [19]. Thus immunizations for control of BoCV should be performed prior to the cattle being exposed to the virus in the marketing and shipping channels. BoCV control programs using vaccination would appear best done at the originating breeding herd.",

Or potentially the BoCV clade 2 strains might be developed as immunogens including subclades 2a,2b and 2c as well. Ideally vaccine efficacy would utilize animal challenge with clinical signs and lesions due to virulent challenge demonstrating protection. Another approach with approval might utilize reduction of viral shedding as a measure of vaccine efficacy.

There were antigenic differences detected based on virus neutralization tests using multiple strains from each subclade. Our results indicate genetic and antigenic differences, and thus these results have potential application for immunogens. The MLV vaccine available in the U.S. is a member of the BoCV clade 1, and our respiratory isolates were in BoCV clade 2.
