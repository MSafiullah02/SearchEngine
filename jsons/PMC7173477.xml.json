Reminders of this chastening fact include the devastating outbreak of Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany in 2011, in which 54 people died and 22% of the 3186 cases of E. coli O104 developed the severe complication, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Outbreaks are striking events, yet the percentage of all cases of foodborne disease that occur as part of outbreaks is fairly small. The first port of call when seeking to understand the prevalence of foodborne disease is the official bodies that have responsibility for monitoring illness in the population. However, the datasets amassed by these organizations tend to underestimate the population burden of illness so, in the past decade or so, there has been a proliferation of new methods across Europe in an attempt to overcome this deficiency and develop better estimates of the true population burden of illness.",

The majority of trichinellosis cases occurred in Bulgaria, Romania, and Lithuania, where it is likely to be associated with eating domestically reared pork and wild boar, and most confirmed echinococcosis cases were from Bulgaria, where increasing proportions of Echinococcus-positive cattle and sheep are also being reported. Overall, yersiniosis rates were decreasing but remain high in the Nordic states, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, where infection is often associated with pork consumption. Confirmed case rates for listeriosis were highest in 2009 in Denmark (rate=1.8 cases per 100 000 population), which has experienced a marked increase in cases, especially in people over 70 years of age. The increase was attributed, at least in part, to a surge in consumption of ready-to-eat (RTE) products in Denmark, especially in older people. A similar pattern was witnessed in the UK, where a doubling in cases of listeriosis in people aged more than 60 since 2001 was attributed to a combination of greater consumption of RTE products like sandwiches coupled with an increase in underlying medical conditions like cancer, requiring complex, immunosuppressive treatment.",

There are international partners from North America, Australia, China, India, and New Zealand. The objectives of NoroNet include providing better estimates for the proportion of foodborne NoV infections and determining the high-risk foods associated with illness. Several publicly available analytical tools have been developed including a \u2018transmission mode tool\u2019 to increase the chances of identifying a foodborne source of infection. Using this tool to analyze 1254 outbreaks from nine countries reported between 2002 and 2006 showed that the proportion of NoV outbreaks that were likely to be foodborne was 22%. \u2018NoroNet\u2019 was also instrumental in identifying the latest pandemic strain \u2013 the Sydney 2012 virus, which has recently overtaken all others to become the dominant strain worldwide.",

In most countries, an episode of illness has no chance of being included in surveillance statistics unless the patient consults a doctor or nurse.

However, there are several limitations when interpreting the results. The first is the robustness of evidence incriminating a food vehicle in an outbreak in the first place. For example, in the EFSA Report published in 2010 only 698 of 5262 outbreaks were considered to provide strong evidence of a link to a food vehicle. Second, it has to be accepted that the distribution of food vehicles implicated in outbreaks is the same as the distribution of food vehicles responsible for sporadic cases of infection and this is a major assumption.",

One of the difficulties in using outbreak data, however, is that foods implicated in reported outbreaks are often complex foods, containing several ingredients or food items, any one of which might be the specific source of the pathogen. The method works best for pathogens where outbreaks are relatively common. So, for example, it is more robust for STEC and Salmonella than it is for Campylobacter, because Campylobacter outbreaks are rarely recognized. Using EU outbreak data, 58% of Salmonella cases that could be allocated to a source were attributed to contaminated eggs and 29% of Campylobacter cases that could be allocated to a source were attributed to contaminated poultry. However, for both pathogens the majority of cases could not be attributed to a source, illustrating another limitation of using outbreak data for these purposes.",

First, it is possible that people reported transient changes in bowel habit not caused by IID. Second, these cases might have been caused by organisms not included in the diagnostic algorithms, like enteropathogenic or enterotoxigenic E. coli. Third, the cases might have been caused by putative pathogens like enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis or Laribacter hongkongensis. Several coronaviruses, picobirnaviruses, pestiviruses, and toroviruses have recently been proposed as causes of IID, particularly in children.
