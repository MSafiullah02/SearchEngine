Surgical or procedure masks can protect personnel from acquisition via deposition of droplets on mucous membranes and may also help to keep hands away from nose and mouth. Eye shields give added protection against infection via the conjunctiva. Face shields or goggles have been shown to prevent RSV infection in health care personnel (37, 38) .
