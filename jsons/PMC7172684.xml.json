These viruses generally exhibit a distinctive five or six pointed star shape appearance under EM which led Madeley and Cosgrove (1975) to coin the term astrovirus to describe them. The AstV genome includes three open reading frames (ORFs) designated ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5\u2032 end of the genome encode non-structural polyproteins including a protease and a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 situated at the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes the structural capsid protein and is transcribed as a subgenomic mRNA (Mendez and Arias, 2007, Monroe, 2005).",

            "text": "Astroviruses are generally associated with either mild or severe signs of enteric disease such as diarrhoea and vomiting in a number of mammalian species (Mendez and Arias, 2007). Astroviruses have also been found to cause no detectable disease or to cause disease only occasionally (Bridger et al., 1984, Marshall et al., 1987, Chu et al., 2008). Human astroviruses (HuAstVs) have been the most extensively studied group of astroviruses and have been repeatedly shown to be a common cause of diarrhoea in young children, the elderly and the immunocompromised (Dennehy et al., 2001, Gallimore et al., 2006, Gray et al., 1987, Akihara et al., 2005). AstV also appear second to rotaviruses as gastroenteritis agents responsible for children hospitalization (Glass et al., 1996). There are presently 8 recognized serotypes of closely related HuAstVs, all of which belong to a single species (Monroe, 2005). Phylogenetic groupings (genotypes) of HuAstV strains were found to be fully congruent with serotyping analyses since 8 well defined clusters were formed regardless of the genomic region analysed (Noel et al., 1995, Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002). In recent years, a number of genetically distinct strains of HuAstV have been identified, characterized and proposed to represent novel AstV species based on a genetic distance criteria (Finkbeiner et al., 2008, Kapoor et al., 2009) although this proposal is still awaiting ICTV's approval.",

Porcine AstVs were first detected by EM in faeces of a diarrheic piglet (Bridger, 1980). It was then successfully propagated in porcine embryonic kidney cells and shown to cause mild diarrhoea in piglets under experimental conditions (Shimizu et al., 1990). Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene from this isolate (PAstV-1) followed and helped determine that past spill over events between cats, pigs and humans were likely to have happened (Jonassen et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2001). A closely related strain was also more recently isolated from a pig diarrhoeal sample and successfully propagated in vitro (Indik et al., 2006). Apart from these few reports, there is to knowledge no available data on the diversity of porcine astroviruses. We used a PCR approach to investigate the presence and diversity of porcine astroviruses using both specific and broad range (pan-astrovirus) primers. Our study reveals the presence in swine of prototypical strains as well as two lineages of previously unknown astroviruses. In addition, we found that astroviruses were present on all swine farms investigated independent of age group and in nearly 80% of slaughtered healthy pigs.",

Phylogenetic analyses using amino acid or nucleotide sequences formed a monophyletic group (not shown). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences amplified using the pan-astrovirus primers (primer set 2) revealed that all porcine strains amplified contained the characteristic \u201cYGDD\u201d motif located near the C-terminal region of the RdRp (not shown). This motif is found in the RdRp protein of all astroviruses characterized so far as well as in the RdRp of other RNA virus families such as the Caliciviridae (Green, 2007). Pairwise identity comparisons of deduced amino acid sequences amplified using primer set 2 revealed more heterogeneity among strains (51\u201398% amino acid identity) than sequences generated using primer set 1 even though the former are situated in the more highly conserved polymerase region. Phylogenetic analyses using these partial polymerase sequences from selected strains in addition to prototypical animal AstV strains clustered Canadian porcine strains in three distinct lineages (Fig. 1a \u2013 group I, II, III). Group I strains were related to PAstV-1 strain and to typical human and feline strains.

Using 3\u2032 RACE-PCR, we were able to amplify and characterize approximately 3 kb of nucleotide sequence from each strain which included the 3\u2032 end of the RdRp gene, the complete capsid gene and the 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 2a). Astroviruses contain a conserved sequence (UUUGGAGNGGNGGACCNAAN\n5\u20138\nAUGNC) located at the junction between ORF1b and ORF2 which has been proposed to be a regulatory element serving as a promoter for subgenomic RNA transcription (following the convention of HuAstV which places the initiation AUG codon \u2013 underlined \u2013 for ORF2 immediately upstream of the ORF1b stop codon) (Mendez and Arias, 2007). Alignment of the corresponding region from the 4 representative PoAstV strains characterized here along with prototypical AstV strains revealed that it is highly conserved in all strains (shown for \u223c30 nt in Fig. 2b). Interestingly, strains PoAstV12-4 and PoAstV14-4 contain a unique insertion of 3 nucleotides upstream of the ORF2 initiation codon which is not present in any of the other AstV strains. The ORF2 start codon (bold) of strains PoAstV12-3 and PoAstV16-2 appeared in an optimal Kozak context for translation initiation (RNNAUGG, where R = A/G and N = A/T/G/C) (Kozak, 1991), whereas those of strains PoAstV12-4 and PoAstV14-4 appeared in a less favourable context with a C residue at position -3 (Fig. 2b). The ORF2 genes are predicted to encode capsid proteins of between 755 and 783 amino acids in length which is comparable to all mamastrovirus known to date (Table 2\n). Molecular masses (Mr) are predicted to be between 82.1 kDa and 85.6 kDa. The length of the 3\u2032UTR of the four PoAstV strains varied from 76 to 86 nucleotides which is comparable to most mamastrovirus known to date (Table 2). All mamastrovirus strains except human strain MLB-1 contain a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) in the 3\u2032 UTR. This motif has also been reported in some picornaviruses and coronaviruses (Jonassen et al., 1998). The exact role of this motif is unclear, but due to its presence in many viral families, it has been suggested to have an important function in viral RNA replication. As is shown in Fig. 2c, alignment of this region reveals that strains PoAstV12-3 and PoAstV16-2 contain a highly conserved s2m motif whereas the corresponding sequence of strains PoAstV12-4 and PoAstV14-4 appear highly divergent, which is reminiscent of human strain Ast-MLB-1 (Finkbeiner et al., 2008).",

Most interestingly, phylogenetic and distance analyses revealed that strains PoAstV12-4 and PoAstV14-4 were highly divergent from known AstV strains and formed a novel group of mammastrovirus distantly related to the human/feline/porcine AstV group (Fig. 1b and Table 3). Altogether, these analyses confirmed that swine harbour phylogenetically diverse AstV strains most likely derived from distinct ancestors. Phylogenetic analyses performed with either the larger polymerase fragment (\u223c250 aa) (not shown) or the complete capsid coding sequence from the 4 novel porcine strains did not reveal any differences in the branching patterns of the threes indicating that these strains are unlikely to represent recombinants.",

A remarkable and surprising diversity of AstVs was disclosed in these hosts. Based on the data presented, which includes genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we conclude in the existence of three distinct lineages of porcine astroviruses, two of which are unprecedented. Pairwise amino acid identities between strains within each of these lineages range from only 23% to 31%, which is comparable to distances between established AstV species. Porcine strains belonging to two of the lineages (group I and III) were more closely related to other animal's AstV strains than they were to each other suggesting different ancestral origin of porcine AstVs and past interspecies transmission involving sheep, mink, felines, humans and possibly additional yet unknown hosts. Likewise, a number of novel human AstV strains were recently shown to be genetically closer to animal AstVs strains and more distantly related to type HuAstV species suggesting different origins (Finkbeiner et al., 2008, Kapoor et al., 2009). In addition, Chu et al. (2008) and Zhu et al. (2009) have also shown that AstVs isolated from the same species of bats cluster in different groups following phylogenetic reconstruction. Taken together, data from these three mammalian hosts suggest that AstVs found within a single animal species can have distinct origins most likely reflecting past interspecies transmission which underscores the zoonotic potential of these viruses.",

Hence, reminiscent of a number of AstV strains recently recovered from humans and bats (Kapoor et al., 2009, Chu et al., 2008), the PoAstV strains characterized in this study should be classified as a single viral species. However, it is now clear that multiple AstV lineages can infect the same animal species and there is also growing evidence that AstVs can cross the species barrier (Chu et al., 2008, Zhu et al., 2009, Kapoor et al., 2009). For these reasons, it has been suggested that the classification of AstV should not be solely based on the species of origin but should also rely on a distance criteria of either the RdRp or the capsid genes (Kapoor et al., 2009). The data presented in the present study supports this contention.",

Since all samples from this study, including those from group I, were from apparently healthy pigs, our results shed a new light on the pathogen/host relationship between pigs and astroviruses. It is well known that AstVs can cause enteric disease in numerous animal species (Mendez and Arias, 2007, Toffan et al., 2009, Atkins et al., 2009). However, it has also been reported that asymptomatic carriers of AstV exist (Rivera et al., 2010, Kapoor et al., 2009, Chu et al., 2008). AstV infections in swine may express their pathogenicity in only a small percentage of cases, in conjunction with other pathogens or more severely in young animals like has often been observed in other animal species such as humans (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975, Bridger, 1980, Woode and Bridger, 1978, Snodgrass and Gray, 1977). It should be noted that only two strains of group I AstVs were detected in our study and that mild diarrhoea could have been overlooked in those cases. Alternatively, as mentioned before, there is a possibility that AstVs might express their pathogenicity in only a small percentage of cases.",

This situation is reminiscent of some human, bat and turkey strains (Jonassen et al., 1998, Chu et al., 2008, Finkbeiner et al., 2009). These findings bring into question the biological role of the s2m motif which is thought to be important in the viral life cycle (Jonassen et al., 1998, Jonassen et al., 2001). Perhaps these divergent strains are able to compensate by forming stable secondary structures with a similar role to the s2m in different parts of their 3\u2032 UTR.

Our data corroborates previous reports where seroprevalence to AstV in pigs as high as 83% were reported in some herds (Shimizu et al., 1990). Group II PoAstVs were by far the most commonly detected AstV strains in the sampled population using the pan-AstV approach suggesting it was the dominant group of AstV in the studied population. Such high virus detection rates could imply that pigs are persistently infected with various strains of AstVs similar to what has been reported in bats (Chu et al., 2008). Further studies to determine the pathogenic potential of porcine AstVs belonging to the different lineages in pigs of different ages are warranted.",

Genetic and phylogenetic characterization of the complete 3\u2032 end from selected porcine AstV strains revealed the existence of 3 distinct lineages, most likely of different origins, with genetic distances between these being consistent with distances found between established species in the family Astroviridae. The fact that two lineages of porcine AstVs are phylogenetically related to human strains underscores the zoonotic potential of theses viruses. In addition, the work also showed high prevalence of AstVs in healthy pigs of different ages bringing into light new data about the relationship between porcine AstVs and their host. The combination of a large and diverse gene pool in pigs makes these animals an important and pivotal reservoir for the evolution and ecology of the Astroviridae.",
