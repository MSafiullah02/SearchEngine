Most viruses circu late in a community every year; however, some, especially influenza type B and the parainfluenza viruses, may cause epidemics at biennial or longer intervals.3 Different viruses also predominate in a community during different seasons of the year; overlap invariably occurs and the actual timing and severity of each outbreak or epidemic can vary from year to year. In tropical climates, seasonality also exists. In these regions, RSV occurs predominantly in the rainy season, whereas influenza activity occurs throughout the year with a marked peak in activity during the dry season and a lesser peak during the rainy season.27, 28 Seasons of both higher and lower temperature have been associated with these viruses in different countries.27 The reasons for the seasonality of respiratory virus infections and their variation by latitude are not clear. More important than the environmental conditions themselves may be their effect on behavior. Seasons when people spend more time indoors, in closer contact with other people (colloquially called \u201cclosed-in season\u201d in some regions), will favor more rapid person-to-person transmission.",

RSV causes the most severe LRI in children less than 1 year of age, with a peak occurring at a mean age of 3 months.29 The peak age for hMPV infection is later than that for RSV,30 but the majority of children have had clinical or subclinical infection by 2 years of age. Similarly, hPIV infections occur at an older peak age than RSV. Human parainfluenza virus-1 causes LRIs predominantly in infants aged 7 to 36 months, with peak infection occurring in the second and third years of life. The peak infection of hPIV-2 occurs in the second year of life, but hPIV-3 differs in that it infects infants younger than 6 months and most children experience infection in the first year of life. All age groups are at risk of infection from influenza type A and B viruses, but preschool-age children in day care and school-age children have the highest infection rates.31 The very young, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions experience more severe disease. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses commonly cause URI and infect individuals many times throughout their lives. Rhinoviruses are also clearly associated with LRI in children, but their role remains to be elucidated.32\n",

Different organisms require different types of sample and different specialized laboratory identification methods, few of which are in routine use, even in developed countries. For example, sensitive detection of RSV, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires, respectively, immunofluorescent antigen detection on nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate, bacterial culture of lung biopsy tissue, and inoculation of bronchoalveolar lavage or gastric aspirate specimens into liquid broth with subsequent confirmation by PCR speciation.2.\nLimitations of identifying consolidation: Chest radiography accurately identifies established pathologic consolidation but may miss early infection. However, as with microbial diagnosis, radiology is not routinely necessary for clinical management and is not consistently performed during respiratory infections.3.\nLimitations of availability of facilities and expertise: Clinical, laboratory, and radiology facilities and diagnostic expertise are distributed in a very patchy fashion throughout the world. In many parts of the developing world, diagnosis and case management rely on poorly resourced village health workers with the support of a central clinic.

In the presence of herd immunity over 300,000 deaths (83% of deaths) and 2.5 million cases (85% of cases) might be prevented. Miller97 estimated that among Asian countries, about 136,000 (87%) Hib deaths could be prevented annually with incorporation of Hib vaccine into the immunization programs at a cost of between 0.1% and 3.0% of per capita gross national product per child younger than 5 years.

Influenza B viruses have a human reservoir, whereas influenza A viruses have a reservoir in aquatic birds and are antigenically diverse. Influenza A viruses have two major antigenic surface proteins, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). We recognize 16 different H antigens (named H1\u201316) and nine different N antigens (N1\u20139), and unique combinations of H and N antigens are called influenza A subtypes. All of these subtypes have been found circulating among wild aquatic birds, their primary natural reservoir. From time to time, these viruses cross the species barrier, with some becoming established in another avian or animal species. In the past century, the influenza A subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have been able to infect and establish sustained transmission among humans, whereas the H5N1 subtype has become established in domestic poultry (Fig. 31-13\n). The constant evolution of influenza A and B viruses occurs through the accumulation of mutational changes in the H and N antigens. This antigenic drift leads to the selection of new variants and regular epidemics of disease, while reassortment of the H and N genes of different influenza A subtypes (antigenic shift) leads to the emergence of a novel virus and pandemic influenza.105 However, it is becoming clear that the emergence of human influenza virus lineages can occur through avenues other than drift and shift.106\n",

In 1999, H9N2 avian influenza infected two children in Hong Kong and there were other cases in mainland China. In 2003, H5N1 and H9N2 infections were confirmed in Hong Kong, while in the Netherlands, a large avian influenza outbreak involved an H7N7 virus. Up to 1000 cases among farmers and poultry workers occurred. Since late 2003, outbreaks of avian H5N1 have been reported among poultry in Southeast Asia.122 Human infections and deaths were initially reported in Vietnam and Thailand. This virus has become endemic in domestic poultry in Asia and has spread globally after infecting migratory waterfowl.123 Subsequently, there have been reports of human infections in an increasing number of countries.
