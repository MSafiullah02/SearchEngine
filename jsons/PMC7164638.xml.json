Participants completed the questionnaire through the CloudResearch [5] online platform in early February 2020. We asked participants to rank who they felt should lead the US response to COVID-19. Options included the president, Congress, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Director for the National Institutes of Health (NIH; S1 Survey). In addition, participants completed the perceived risk scale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.71) which had 10 survey-items (5-point Likert Scale: 0 = strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1 = agree/strongly agree). We also asked about their support for restrictive infection prevention policies and the reliability of various sources of information (S1 Survey). Descriptive analyses were conducted. Yale University Institutional Review Board approved this study (IRB protocol number: 2000027402). Participants provided informed consent prior to data collection.",

Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety. [3] Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone\u2019s country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate. However, our sample was fairly representative of the general adult US population. A weighted analysis based on age and gender demonstrate that our results are generalizable to national population (Table 2). Data for weighted analysis were extracted from US Census data. [7]",
