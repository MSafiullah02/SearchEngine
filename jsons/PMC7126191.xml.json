Many studies focus on ventilation design and range from single and multibed ward spaces [14], [15], [16], [17] to high risk areas such as operating theatres [18], treatment rooms and isolation rooms [19], [20]. Other related applications include outdoor pathogen dispersion in the SARS outbreak [21] and assessing air disinfection device performance [22]. However the validity of such simulations relies on appropriate definition of a pathogen source and an appropriate model for the transport of the pathogen through the air.",

            "text": "Pathogen transport is typically approached in one of two ways. A passive scalar model treats airborne pathogens as a concentration that is transported with the air. Particle properties are approximated through a diffusion coefficient, but the actual particle dynamics are not incorporated. As such the model tends to be used for demonstrating ventilation efficacy [23] and in the context of pathogens is regarded as acceptable for simulating respiratory diseases where the particle size is below 2 mm [14], [15]. The airborne pathogen concentration can easily be presented and is ideal for showing steady state behaviour where there is a continuous source. Alternatively the movement of individual particles can be tracked using a Lagrangian particle tracking model. This considers the forces on particles due to their mass and momentum, producing path lines that are dependent on particle size and density as well as the local airflow. In theory the technique can be applied to any particle size and can also be used to evaluate deposition patterns. The main limitation of the approach is that tracking is time dependant and it is therefore difficult to determine steady state airborne contaminant distributions.",

Particle tracking models have been compared against experiments conducted over a wide range of particle sizes. Particle mass concentration is well represented provided a large enough number of particles are injected in the model [27], [28], while good correlation with particle distribution has been demonstrated up to 10 mm [29], [30] except in areas of high gradients such as close to the source or at air inlets. Recent studies have indicated that including the effects of turbulent diffusion through a Discrete Random Walk (DRW) model improves the predictions, with Wan et al [31] showing good vertical and horizontal distribution of particles using a DRW approach, although Lai and Chen [32] indicate that the model is highly sensitive to grid size particularly when modelling particle deposition.",

A number of studies provide indirect evidence by showing that bioaerosols compare well to experimental particle tracers [33], [34]. Some authors have also attempted to validate by comparison with microorganism deposition in real environments such as operating theatres [35] but found that the lack of control in the experiment and inability to incorporate the movement of people into the CFD model resulted in discrepancies between the two. Apart from some limited data in Noakes et al.

A standard k-\u025b turbulence model was used with enhanced wall treatment and a no slip condition applied at the wall. Two different air flow regimes (A and B) were applied as shown in Fig. 1. In ventilation regime A the low-wall supply air inlet was defined as a series of velocity profiles to represent the angled louvers and the high-wall extract as a zero pressure boundary. In ventilation regime B the ceiling mounted four-way diffuser was represented as a box that projected 60 mm into the space with a velocity boundary condition on each side on the box angled at 45\u00b0. The ceiling mounted extract was again defined as a zero pressure boundary in models 1 and 2, and with a negative pressure in model 3.

Results are normalized in order to compare the pattern of dispersal between the simulations and experiments. For the experimental data a normalised value was found for each experiment and the average of all three experiments used for comparison. For the simulations the values are normalised using the average from all three lines. As can be seen in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 there is a large variation in bioaerosol measurements which is likely to be due to loss of viability during nebulisation and sampling. However, despite this variation there is clear tendency for the simulation to follow the same dispersion pattern as found experimentally. In both simulations and experiments there is a tendency for the contaminant to be entrained into the inlet air stream at higher air change rates (Fig. 7\n). This pull towards the inlet was also confirmed using smoke tests. It was not possible to take experimental samples directly at the source, although based on interpolation it appears that there is a tendency to overestimate the concentration at this location in the simulations which has previously been noted by Zhang et al.

There is a lack of literature presenting experimental data on the deposition of bioaerosols however there have been some attempts to validate the deposition of particles. Leduc and Fredriksson [43] replicated the deposition within a particle sampler and found the RNG turbulence model gave improved results for the deposition of particles <1 \u03bcm.

The study considered the overall deposition of a range of particles with a mass median diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm and found the results to be comparable between the simulation and experiments, but only when the DRW model was incorporated into the particle tracking model. Since the aim of the zonal source is to simulate average behaviour of a bioaerosol source it may be expected that using simply the effect of the bulk airflow on the particle would provide adequate results. However, without incorporating the DRW model the deposition was significantly underestimated. These results are promising, indicating that simple passive scalar and particle tracking approaches within steady state CFD models may be used to understand the behaviour of bioaerosols. However to understand the effect of turbulence on smaller particles further work is required. The validation also does not consider the pattern of deposition across the space which is important to understand where pathogenic particles may land and cause reservoirs of infection within a ward. However this study provides an important step in validating CFD models to the airborne dispersion and the total deposition of bioaerosols within a room.",

The zonal source is an attempt to respond to this situation by providing a way of representing an important source of bacteria in a hospital in a manner which represents the inherent assumptions required when simulating such a scenario. It is clear from the numerical simulation described above that the average behaviour of the steady state zonal source correlates very well to the average behaviour of a transient source. Therefore this simple representation of the dispersal could provide valuable results to improve understanding of bioaerosol transport within hospitals. As well as taking significantly less time and effort to generate the simulation, the simple results from a steady state simulation convey the average behaviour of the scenario rather than presenting misleadingly complex results from a transient model of an uncertain situation. Although the point source showed a reasonable representation of the moving source in one of the air flow regimes the results exhibited more case dependence than the zonal source. Since it is not possible to know whether it would be representative without carrying out transient simulations for comparison it should be assumed that the point source will not be suitable for simulating the release of bacteria during activity that has a significant spatial component, as in certain air flow regimes it can give highly erroneous results. However, despite the clear improvement in correlation to the time averaged dispersal with the zonal source this validation only represents an initial test with a continuous release from a single point source traversing the space with a constant speed. The zonal source has not been compared to a point source with different velocities, directional changes, or one whose injection concentration varies in time. Equally, although the point source shows much greater case dependency this is based on only two airflow regimes. With other ventilation configurations such as local extract or displacement ventilation the results may differ.",

This is important because patients themselves move, as do hospital beds. It is therefore quite feasible that the location of the bioaerosol source will move. Small movements of source location, particularly with strong directional airflows can have large effects on the risk to HCWs as shown in the sensitivity study. As such it is imperative to carry out sensitivity studies to understand how the risk evaluation changes with source location.",

For instance every time a bed is made the movements will vary to some extent. Therefore an exact zone can never be defined, and it is important to understand the implications that the assumption of zone size and shape will make. Considering Fig. 13, Fig. 15, the zonal source gives reasonably similar results for changes in volume over the top of the bed. However when the source is very thin there are very high concentration values near the bed and with the particle tracking model there is much greater deposition onto the bed. Since the turbulence model is known to overestimate the velocities perpendicular to the wall [32] it is not surprising that when all the particles are injected 2 or less cells away the rates of deposition are high.

There are attempts to incorporate human movement into airflow models e.g [37]. However despite being more accurate and detailed for the single motion that is being simulated these will not provide a good understanding of how an isolation room performs in practice when the nurse will move in many different ways.

He created zones with sources of momentum for the person moving through the space. Following this initial validation of time averaging to represent the dispersal of bacteria due to movement it would be beneficial to link this with the ideas laid out in Brohus et al.

The experimental comparison is limited to the behaviour of small diameter (\u223c2.5 mm) bioaerosols and loss of viability generates large variability in the experimental data. However, the results give increased confidence that both approaches are appropriate for representing the dispersion of airborne pathogens in indoor environments.",

If the space is not only for respiratory patients, it is necessary to consider the dispersal of bacteria from other sources including nursing activities. For this situation a zonal source encompassing the area of activity may give a better representation of the average risk. Even in situations where the space is being specifically designed for respiratory diseases, such as TB, it is necessary to consider the sensitivity of the source location especially when using directional ventilation systems.",
