            "text": "Morphologically, the arteriviruses resemble the togaviruses. Arteriviral particles are between 55 and 60 nm in diameter and contain an isometric nucleocapsid surrounded by a viral envelope (Cavanagh et al., 1994). The coronaviruses, on the other hand, are pleomorphic viruses between 60 and 200 nm in diameter; their viral envelopes surround helical nucleocapsid structures (Siddell, 1995). Although morphologically distinct, the gene order and replication strategy of the arteriviruses are similar to those of the coronaviruses (Snijder and Spaan, 1995). The single-stranded RNA genomes of EAV, LDV and PRRSV are polycistronic containing eight ORFs. The ultimate (ORF 1a) and penultimate (ORF 1b) 5\u2032 ORFs, which make up approximately two-thirds of the viral genomes, encode the proteins necessary for viral replication. The ORF 1b genes of the corona- and arteriviruses contain four conserved domains (Godeny et al., 1993). Beginning at the N-terminal portion of the ORF 1b peptide, the domains were identified as a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, a putative Zn-finger domain, a putative helicase domain and a carboxy-terminal ORF 1b domain; this last domain, whose function is unknown, is unique to coronaviruses and arteriviruses (Godeny et al., 1993; Snijder and Spaan, 1995). The remaining 3\u2032 one-third of the viral genomes contain six overlapping ORFs, some of which encode the viral structural proteins (Snijder and Spaan, 1995).",

The viral genome was purified from the supernatant fluid 24 h postinfection as previously described (Godeny et al., 1995). cDNA transcripts of the SHFV genome were made using a genome walking strategy. Briefly, cDNA was made by reverse transcription of the viral RNA using synthetic DNA primers complementary to identified SHFV genome sequences downstream of the sequence to be determined. The cDNA was made double-stranded as previously described (Godeny et al., 1995) and inserted into the pGEM7ZF+ plasmid vector (Promega Corp.) using standard methods (Maniatis et al., 1989). The resulting clones were amplified in Escherichia coli, strain JM107, and screened as described previously (Godeny et al., 1995). Clones were sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). In order to procure the majority sequence of the viral genome, multiple clones for each nucleotide were sequenced. If more than one clone was not available for a particular nucleotide, than the sequence was determined directly from the SHFV RNA genome using the RT RNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Gaps between clones were also sequenced directly from the SHFV RNA genome.",

At the 5\u2032 end of the sequence, nt 1 through 153 encode the C-terminal portion of the conserved helicase domain and the entire carboxy-terminal ORF 1b domain is encoded by nt 778 through 1053. This data suggest that the partial ORF at the 5\u2032 end of this sequence, beginning at nt 1 and ending at nt 1590, is the 3\u2032 end of the SHFV ORF 1b gene. Between the SHFV ORF 1b gene and the 76 nt 3\u2032 noncoding region are nine complete ORFs (Fig. 1). This is notable because the other arteriviruses have only six ORFs in this region. Therefore, the SHFV genome encodes three additional ORFs as compared to EAV, LDV and PRRSV.",

The ORF 2b and 7 peptides contain the most N-linked glycosylation sites with 10 and 8, respectively. Four of the 3\u2032 ORFs encode peptides containing only one or two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Table 1). It has previously been reported that although the SHFV capsid and membrane proteins, which are encoded by ORFs 8 and 9, contain potential N-linked glycosylation sites, they are not glycosylated proteins (Godeny et al., 1995).

On the other hand, the genomes of the coronaviruses are approximately 30 000 nt in length (Siddell, 1995), twice as long as the genomes of the arteriviruses. ORFs 1a and 1b are located at the 5\u2032 end of the coronavirus and arterivirus genomes and encompass approximately two-thirds of the genomes. The gene products of these two ORFs are non-structural proteins which are necessary for viral replication. The remaining one-third of the genomes contain the 3\u2032 ORFs, some of which encode structural proteins found on the viral particle. The 3\u2032 SHFV ORFs, ORFs 2a through 9, and the 3\u2032 noncoding region are encoded on a total of 4754 nt. Assuming that these ORFs make up one-third of the viral genome, it can be deduced that the SHFV genome is approximately 14 300 nt in length. Indeed, biochemical analysis of purified SHFV RNA suggested that the genome is 15 000 nt in length (Sagripanti, 1984)",

We previously showed that the ultimate, ORF 9, and penultimate, ORF 8, 3\u2032 ORFs encode the SHFV capsid, p15, and membrane, p20, proteins, respectively (Godeny et al., 1995). The ORF 7 gene likely encodes one of the envelope glycoproteins based on hydrophobicity analysis (Wang et al., 1995) and the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Table 1) on the encoded peptide. Computer analysis of the SHFV ORF 7 peptide using the GAP program within the GCG software package shows a 53% and 57% amino acid sequence similarity between this peptide and the ORF 5 products of LDV and LV, respectively, further suggesting that the SHFV ORF 7 encodes the SHFV large envelope glycoprotein, p54. The gene products of the SHFV ORFs 2a through 6 remain to be identified. Computer analyses of the potential products from these ORFs reveal a low amino acid sequence similarity (39% to 49%) with the ORFs 2 through 4 products of EAV, LDV and LV (data not shown). Presently, there is no evidence that any of the arterivirus 3\u2032 ORFs encode nonstructural proteins. However, since there are three additional ORFs on the SHFV genome as compared to the genomes of the other arteriviruses, it is possible that some, or all, of these additional SHFV ORFs may encode nonstructural peptides. Due to packaging constraints on isometric viruses, it is unlikely, however, that any of the SHFV 3\u2032 ORFs encode nonessential peptides as do the coronaviruses.",

However, Northern blot analyses show that SHFV produces a set of six sgRNAs during replication (Godeny et al., 1995; Zeng et al., 1995). Therefore, further studies are underway to determine whether (1) more than one ORF is translated from some of the SHFV sgRNA, (2) some of the SHFV ORFs are silent, or (3) some of the SHFV sgRNAs are produced at levels below the detection limits of Northern analyses.",
