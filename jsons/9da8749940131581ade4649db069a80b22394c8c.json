Rivers carry water and sediment supplied by the hydrological cycle and erosional mechanisms, which play a major role in the shaping of the Earth's surface. River basins result, for instance, from these naturally organized flow architectures (Bejan 1999; Reis 2006a) . Flow architectures also underline the phenomenon by which wet soil exposed to the sun and wind loses moisture, shrinks superficially, and develops a network of cracks (Bejan 2000) . Similarly, in complex cellular systems such as the vertebrates, the requirement of large amount of oxygen for the metabolic needs of the cells constitutes the basis of the development of specialized and hierarchically organized flow systems, such as the respiratory tract and the circulatory system (Bejan et al. 2004; Reis et al. 2004; Bejan 2005; Reis and Miguel 2006) .",

Examples of these phenomena can be found in almost every field, ranging from physics to the behavior of social groups. For instance, in a horizontal fluid layer that is confined between two plates, and which is heated from below to produce a fixed temperature difference, there is a critical Rayleigh number for which the fluid breaks off from its macroscopically motionless form and starts to present a roll configurationthe Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection (Gettling 1998; Bejan 2000) . It is equally well known that stony corals collected from exposed growth sites, where higher water currents are found, present more spherical and compact shape than corals of the same species growing in sheltered sites, which display a thin-branched morphology (Kaandorp and Sloot 2001; Merks et al. 2003) . Furthermore, bacterial colonies that have to cope with hostile environmental conditions have more branched growth forms than colonies of the same species from nutrientrich environments (Ben-Jacob et al. 1995; Thar and K\u00fchl 2005) . In a similar manner, plant roots seem to be able to respond to localized regions of high nutrient supply by proliferating or elongating root branches into the nutrient-rich patches (Robinson 1994; Hodge et al. 1999) . Root systems in soil are more open and more thinly branched than roots which are growing in hydroponics regime.",

Throughout history several pandemics have occurred in many areas of our planet, infecting and wiping out a large number of people. One of the most catastrophic pandemics was the bubonic plague (Black Death) in the fourteenth century. It is estimated that a third of the European population at the time died as a consequence of this outbreak. Moreover, historic records of the progress of this outbreak suggest a wave-like propagation of the disease (Langer 1964) . What are the conditions for the existence of such a traveling wave?

When u << D (e.g., u is close to zero), the time of transition t * becomes very large (t * \u2192 ). In this situation, transition from diffusive to convective driven transport is not very likely to occur and the tracer transport is linked only to a diffusive phenomenon. However, if fluid velocity is much larger than the tracer diffusivity, the transition time (Eq. 5.7) is very small. What are the consequences of this? The initial diffusive velocity (Eq. 5.5) is larger than any convective velocity (Eq. 5.6), but decreases as t \u22121/2 .

Consider, e.g., stony corals growing in exposed (open) sites. In this case, nutrient transport is driven mainly by convection. The velocity of the nutrient-rich water which surrounds the coral colony is much larger than the growth velocity of corals (which for a specie named Porites spp. is, for instance, about 12 mm per year). This implies that the coral grows always inside a region where nutrients are readily available. Consequently, it is able to spread (diffuse) in all directions and develop the most effective arrangement for filling the space in the shortest time-a round shape. Assume that the coral is growing in a sheltered site. When the velocity of the water containing nutrients becomes close to zero, the transport of nutrients is mainly due to diffusion and nutrients close to the coral colony are quickly depleted. Thus, the decrease of nutrient concentration around the coral triggers a wave of nutrients with a velocity of propagation v dif = dL dif dt \u223c 1 2 D t 1/2 , Eq. (5.5), and a characteristic length L dif \u223c 1 2 Dt 1/2 . The initial velocity of propagation v dif \u2192 is much larger than the growth velocity of corals (\u223c 12 mm per year), but decreases as t \u22121/2 . Thus, there is a moment when the growth speed of the biological system exceeds the speed of nutrient propagation.",

This plot shows that at the critical time, t ct , the characteristic length of the coral system overtakes the characteristic length corresponding to the diffusive transport. From this moment on the circular shape is no longer the most effective arrangement to fill the space. At times slightly larger than t ct , the biological system starts to grow outside of the nutrient diffusion region. Guaranteed survival, branches are then generated to promote the easiest possible access to nutrients. This \"biological channeling\" enables the system to experience again growth inside the nutrient diffusion region from t ct until 2t ct . At times slightly greater than 2t ct , the coral once again sticks out the nutrient diffusion region. New branches are consequently sent forward in order to promote the growth inside the nutrient diffusion region until a new critical time is reached. This means that each branch generates a new group of branches, and the result of this process is a dendritic-shaped system.

Some models considering the analogies between physical systems and pedestrian motion have also been proposed, a number of which represent crowds as an aggregate of individuals having a set of motivations and basic rules (Table 5 .1). The so-called social force model (Helbing 1992; Helbing and Moln\u00e1r 1995) has its origins in gas-kinetic models and was developed to describe the dynamics of pedestrian crowds. It consists of self-driven people (particles) that interact through social rules-the \"social forces.\" These forces produce changes in the velocities and reflect in turn, a change in motivation rather than in the physical forces acting on the person. The models presented by Hoogendoorn and Fukui and Ishibashi (1999) Cellular automata discrete model - Helbing (1992) Social force High and low densities Helbing and Moln\u00e1r (1995) Active walker low density Hoogendoorn and Bovy (2000) Extremal principle (generalization of the social force) Density less than five people per square meter Hoogendoorn et al.

Early on, Reynolds (1987) presented a model to approach animal motion, like that of bird flocks and fish schools, that bears relevance to crowd dynamics. This flocking model consisted of three simple steering behaviors which described how each individual flocking element (called boid) maneuvered based on the positions and velocities of its nearby flock mates.",

To answer this question, let us consider pedestrian groups that proceed from one point to every point of a finite-size area (territory). According to the constructal law, the best architecture will be the one that promotes the easiest flow of pedestrians. As described earlier, there are two mechanisms for achieving this purpose: diffusion (slow or high resistivity) and channeling (fast or low resistivity). The access time for a diffusive process through a territory of length L is \u223c L 2 /D, Eq. (5.3), and the access time for a channeling flow is \u223c L/u, Eq. (5.4). To compare both times we need to know the pedestrian's diffusion coefficient, D, and the pedestrian's walking velocity, u. In accordance with field surveys, it has been established that pedestrians prefer to move with a walking velocity around 1 34 ms \u22121 , which corresponds to the least energy-consuming velocity (Fruin 1971; Henderson 1971; Helbing et al. 2001) . This walking velocity is only reachable if there are no other pedestrians and obstacles in the surroundings. Furthermore, it was noticed that pedestrians in a shopping mall or busy city street (random and nondirectional crowd) exhibit a velocity reduction that is related with the free area available around each individual (Fig. 5.10) . Consequently, and as in physics, the pedestrian's diffusion coefficient may be defined as the product of walking (random) velocity, u crd , and the mean available interpersonal distance, .",

This finding has an impact on not only in the design of new pedestrian facilities but Thompson and Marchant (1995) also in the improvement of existing facilities. If the target is to promote the easiest access to pedestrians over a large territory where, for some reason, the velocity is lower than the desired walking velocity (\u223c1 34 ms \u22121 ), the placement of gates/lanes/columns/trees along walkways/corridors helps to stabilize the pedestrian flow and make it more fluid (Fig. 5.12 ). This channeling also allows pedestrians to keep a certain distance from other pedestrians which is highly appreciated (very small interpersonal distances induces contact \"collisions\" among pedestrians which is seen as \"uncomfortable\" (TRB, 1985) ). The placement of gates/lanes/columns/trees (channeling) is especially important in case of pedestrians walking in opposite directions (Fig. 5.13 ).",

There are two degrees of freedom in this design: the shape H 1 /L 1 and the deviation from the normal for the angle between the slower and the faster paths A1 . Optimizing in view of the stated purpose delivers an optimal geometry and a characteristic travel time t 1 from the most distant point in A 1 until its exit point (Bejan and Ledezma 1998) : This configuration also optimizes the access from the whole area to the same exit point (Bejan 2000) .

This diagram reveals one flow can correspond to two different velocities (with the exception of the maximum flow) in spite of each pedestrian velocity matching a single pedestrian flow. This reasoning is analogous to the one put forward in Section 5.4.3. Figure 5 .22 also reveals that there is an optimal velocity such that the flow in the queue is maximized (or time of travel is minimized). When, for instance, 2 = 1 the maximum flow is u a max /4 and occurs when v = u a /2. We can also observe that an increase of 2 reduces the maximum value (the peak) of the flow and that this peak occurs at lower velocities. When 2 < 1, the maximum flow occurs at higher velocities. After that the pedestrian flow drops very fast until it ceases totally. The reverse occurs if 2 > 1. A straightforward explanation can be provided for this finding. If 2 is lower than 1, this means that pedestrians get served before the expected time. Consequently, more pedestrians are allowed to enter in the queue, which can be by increasing the arrival velocity of pedestrians to the queue.",

In line with the access-optimization principle, the optimal flow architecture will be the one that promotes the easiest flow of pedestrian. As described before, there are two locomotion modes for achieving motion: diffusion (slow or high resistivity) and channeling (fast or low resistivity). Diffusion is the preferred locomotion mode as long as it provides the faster pedestrian transport across the territory (e.g., for L/ < 1 2 \u2212 0 5 \u22121 , i.e., for large inter-personal distances or low pedestrian densities). Otherwise, channeling becomes the most competitive transport mechanism. Channeling is faster and allows pedestrians to walk with very weak interpersonal interactions. This explains why moving pedestrians form lanes of uniform velocity when the density is high enough. The question is why do lanes of different velocity form? The answer to this is that a group of pedestrians is often composed of many pedestrians with different walking velocities (e.g., young people walk faster than older people). Besides these, pedestrians follow others who are already moving. These factors are then responsible for differences of velocity between lanes.",

Imagine one of the crossing pedestrians moving toward the stationary crowd. Its successor will see the \"open space\" vacated near by and will proceed to occupy it in order to be carried away.

In microparasite . Susceptible individuals can catch the infection from contact with infected individuals, and the fraction of these individuals recovered is assumed to be immune to the disease. This leads to a set of balance equation that constitutes the SIR model. Extended versions of SIR model have been presented by Anderson and May (1992) , Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) , and Brauer and Castillo-Chavez (2001) . On the other hand, the Noble's model considers that the spatial dispersal of individuals can be well approximated by a diffusion process, with the spread of epidemics being modeled as a diffusivereactive phenomenon. This model was applied to the dynamics of bubonic plague as described throughout Europe in the fourteenth century. Since then reactiondiffusion models have been used to describe, among others, the spatial dynamics of rabies in fox (Kallen et al. 1985) and the Lyme disease transmission (Caraco et al. 2002) . In this section we explore two main issues: the mechanics of epidemics propagation and the effect of population motion on the spread of epidemics.",

In ancient times, transporting commodities over any significant distances were an expensive and risky enterprise. Thus, travel and commerce was restricted mainly to local markets situated not far from home. Today, different modes of transportation (cars, trains, airplanes) deliver people in business and holidays to the most distant parts of the world in only a few hours. In the preceding section we have shown that diffusion and convection (channeling) are the regimes to distribute individuals through a territory (area). Therefore, we can consider that the flux of individuals is a convective-diffusive process, described generically by The sources/sinks of susceptible and infective populations can be modeled based on the following assumptions: (i) natural births and deaths are proportional to the size of the susceptible population (Mena-Lorca and Hethcote 1992); (ii) the infective population has a disease-induced death that is proportional to its size (Nobel 1974) ; and (iii) the transmission from susceptible to infective is proportional to the size of the susceptible and infective populations (Nobel 1974 where t dif and t cv are the time scales associated with the diffusive and the convective populations motion (Section 5.3.1), t S is the time scale associated with the births and life expectancy of the susceptible population, t I is the life expectancy of an inflective, and t I is the contagious time of the disease. Note that the diffusion and convective mechanisms only influence the spread of epidemic after it occurs but they do not play any role on whether the epidemic will occur. The time scale corresponding to the diffusive mode of travel is only smaller than the time scale corresponding to the convective mode if the territory length to access is smaller than D/u. Therefore, diffusion is the optimal travel regime to provide access to all locations while convection is optimal for providing access at large distances.",

There is a positive contribution to the growth of susceptibles since t S is positive and the absolute value is smaller than t I (e.g., the ratio between bdS and the density of infectives has to exceed the disease transmission coefficient). Furthermore, the development of the epidemic is strongly associated to t I and t I . When the life expectancy of an infective is much smaller than the contagious time, the disease tends to disappear.

(5.43) and (5.44) the following coupled differential equations are obtained: From these equations we note that the convective velocity is exclusively related to the damping factor while the diffusive process is related both with the damping and oscillatory factors. When the damping factor equals zero, c \u2212 u I /D I = 0, the system composed by the infective populations reduces to the case of a simple harmonic oscillator: continuous oscillation at the natural frequency I . On the other hand, when c \u2212 u I /D I > 0, the system may or may not oscillate, depending on the relation between the damping factor and the natural frequency: If I > c \u2212 u I /2D I , the system is under damped conditions and exhibits transient behavior, oscillating at Id with an amplitude that decays exponentially. When c \u2212 u I /2D I \u2265 I , there is no oscillatory behavior and the system returns smoothly to its equilibrium position. Thus, a wave-like solution can only exist when c \u2265 u I + 2 D I S \u2212 dI 1/2 \u2265 0 and S \u2265 dI (5.53)",

Thus, low-populated territories and rapidly fatal diseases prevent the spread of infection. This explains why very deathly diseases, such as the Ebola virus, do not spread around the world: up to now these diseases show up in poorly populated and remote areas (e.g., S is very small), and the life expectancy of the inflected population is very short. The above results have important practical implications. If we reduce travel and commerce (e.g., diffusion and convection mechanisms), we also prevent the spread of the epidemic (an increase of diffusive and convective fluxes of infective population induce traveling waves with higher velocities). In territories having a susceptible population below the minimum critical density, a sudden influx of susceptible individuals may initiate an epidemic. On the other hand, when S > di / , a sudden outflow of susceptible (health) population or immunization of a part of individuals by medical intervention (vaccination, culling) reduces the density of susceptible population and may prevent the spread of disease. Finally, by isolation of the infective population we are able to reduce the transmission coefficient and, if the critical transmission coefficient is not exceeded, there is no epidemic outbreak.",
