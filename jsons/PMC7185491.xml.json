We estimated the incidence proportion of head/chest cold, which measures the proportion of workers who reported having a head/chest cold during the last 2 weeks (number of incident cases divided by persons at risk). There are no other questions in the NHIS that capture information on upper respiratory infections over the previous 2 weeks.

A dichotomous variable was created for education\u2014respondents with college or higher education (16 years or more) and respondents with less than 16 years of education. For smoking status, subjects were categorized into never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers. Current smokers were defined as persons who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who reported presently smoking every day or some days. Former smokers were defined as persons who had smoked 100 cigarettes or more in their lifetime, but at the time of interview reported that they were no longer smoking. Never smokers were defined as persons who never smoked or smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.

Damp and moldy environments in some schools across the United States may have contributed to the seasonal pattern observed in our data. Detailed clinical and microbiological investigations focusing on specific communicable diseases would need to be conducted to exclude respiratory symptoms related to indoor allergens.
