A similar coronavirus, which caused mainly vomiting and wasting symptoms in hysterectomy-derived colostrum-deprived pigs was also reported from the U.S.A. (9).

These results are somewhat different from those described by GREIG, who obtained clinical signs consisting of motor central nervous disorders in all inoculated pigs (7) . This may be related to the observation that, with the present virus isolate, only the vomiting and wasting syndrome has been observed, not only in the original outbreak but also in experimental pigs. It should be mentioned, however, that MENGELING was able to reproduce both clinical entities with the same virus isolate (10) . The inability to find the virus in the cerebral cortex of ON inoculated pigs may indicate that the present isolate has little or no affinity for this part of the central nervous system. It is not impossible that, in intracerebrally inoculated pigs, the appear-ance of clinical signs is determined by the ability of the virus to reach the pons + medulla, another possible target organ, from the deposition site.",

Six of the 7 pigs inoculated into the stomach wall, 6 of the 8 pigs inoculated intramuscularly and 3 of the 5 pigs inoculated intracerebrally became ill after an incubation period of 3-3.5 days. None of the pigs inoculated either intravenously or into the abdominal cavity or into the stomach lumen became sick. All diseased pigs showed the vomiting and wasting syndrome. In oronasally inoculated pigs, killed during the early stages of disease, the virus was reisolated consistently from the tonsils and respiratory tract but irregularly from the pons + medulla and the stomach wall. Pigs inoculated by other routes were positive for virus when sick. All except one of the pigs which remained healthy had seroconverted. The site of virus replication which gives rise to the vomition could not be determined. It was concluded from the present studies that virus spread within the body occurs along nerve pathways.",
