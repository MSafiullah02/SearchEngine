Most areas of the country have adopted public health first-level response measures (considered the highest level of response). In the face of the rapidly spreading disease and a large number of infected people, there is an urgent need for effective infection prevention and control measures. However, some of the measures that have been introduced have no scientific basis and have proven to be ineffective.",

Efforts to control the COVID-19 epidemic are likely to require an evidence-based, multifactorial approach. First, there is a need to limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health-care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread. Second, there is a need to rapidly identify, isolate, and provide optimised care for patients. Third, we need to identify and reduce transmission from the animal source or sources. Fourth, we need to address crucial uncertainties such as clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, and treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. We also need to minimise social disruption and economic impact through international, collaborative and multisectoral approaches. Most importantly, we need to communicate the epidemiology and risks of COVID-19 clearly, both to health-care workers and to the general population, and to implement infection prevention and control measures that are based on sound scientific principles.",
