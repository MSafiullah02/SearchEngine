            "text": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the main cause of hospitalization of children younger than 1 year; however, the immune mechanism of bronchiolitis is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the recovery of immune response after a bronchiolitis episode. METHODS: Forty-nine infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis diagnosis were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were processed. Twenty-seven pro-inflammatory biomarkers linked to innate immunity, inflammation, and epithelial damage, as well as nitrites and lipid mediators, were evaluated in the NPA supernatant by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and Luminex. Also, 11 genes were analyzed in NPA cells by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A widespread statistically significant decline of multiple pro-inflammatory parameters and cytokines were detected in the recovery period after respiratory infection: interferon-\u03b12 (IFN\u03b12), IFN\u03b3, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), and MIP-1\u03b2. Supporting these results, a decreased nuclear factor-\u03baB gene expression was observed (P = 0.0116). A significant diminution of cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4) soluble levels (P = 0.0319) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression were observed in the recovery sample. In children classified by post-bronchiolitis wheezing, LTC4 remains elevated in the NPA supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: After bronchiolitis, cytokines and biomarkers linked to innate immune response in NPA decrease significantly in the recovery period accompanied by a drop in LTC4 levels; however, this reduction was lower in infants with post-bronchiolitis wheezing.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization during early infancy; it places a great social and economic burden on healthcare systems and could be responsible for respiratory sequelae. 1 This disease is most frequently caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 2 but rhinovirus (HRV) and others such as human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus (ADV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have also been identified as etiologic agents. 3 Bronchiolitis usually manifests as rhinitis, followed by airway obstruction with crackles on auscultation and wheezing. 4 Hypoxia is one of the main signals of severity. 5 The disease is characterized by airway inflammation, increased mucus production, and, sometimes, necrosis of airway epithelial cells. 6 The disease is manageable with supportive measures, including oxygen supplementation and administration of fluids. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Palivizumab was developed for prophylaxis of RSV-induced bronchiolitis; in spite of its ability to reduce hospitalizations, this treatment is only recommended in infants with risk factors due to its substantial cost. 8 For a long time, acute and severe bronchiolitis presenting in early infancy has been associated with the development of respiratory events, such as recurrent wheezing or asthma during childhood; 9 however, the immune mechanisms associated with these respiratory disorders remain unknown. In a previous study, we evaluated specific cytokines and parameters linked to T-helper type 2 (Th2) immune response in a bronchiolitis-diagnosed population, suggesting that respiratory viruses might shift immune responses toward Th2 in early life. 10 The main purpose of this prospective study was to analyze the evolution of innate and adaptive immune response following an acute episode of bronchiolitis.",

During the acute viral infection, chemokines and cytokines play a key role in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes in the lung. Viral-infected epithelial cells produce a plethora of cytokines and chemokines that can induce recruitment and activation of multiple immune cells. 13 An increase in cytokine levels with antiviral and immunomodulatory activity, such as IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3, and IFN-induced chemokines such as IP-10, is observed during a viral infection as corroborated in our study. In addition to these cytokines, MCP-1 (CCL2), MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), and MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4) classically characterize the immune response against a respiratory infection with viral etiology, and are associated with severity of disease, 14 especially MIP-1\u03b1, due to their capacity for eosinophil recruitment, activation, and degranulation in the respiratory tract. 15, 16 Previous results established that an eosinophilic response to RSV was associated with an increased and prolonged production of MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, eotaxin, and IP-10 during viral infection. 17 In our study, we also obtained a high level of these proteins, but we demonstrate that these high levels are normalized after the acute bronchiolitis episode.",

Moreover, several manuscripts have reported elevated LTC 4 levels in patients with bronchiolitis diagnosis, [26] [27] [28] associating this increase with disease severity. Thus, epidemiological data and these previous evidences suggest a role of bronchiolitis in early life and development of wheezing or asthma; 29,30 furthermore, a recent study of our group has demonstrated that severity and frequency of asthma is higher in infants previously hospitalized by viral coinfection bronchiolitis than those by single-infection bronchiolitis. 31 However, in this study, no significant differences were observed between single and coinfection in the immunological environment parameters studied.",

            "text": "In our study, LTC 4 underwent a less significant decrease in children who suffered wheezing in the 12 months following a bronchiolitis episode compared with infants without wheezing episodes. According to our findings, Da Dalt et al. 32 observed that nasal LTC 4 levels remained elevated 1 month after the onset of acute bronchiolitis. 32 However, these data do not clarify whether elevated LTC 4 levels are a cause or a consequence of recurrent wheezing after a viral respiratory infection. One hypothesis is that viral infection produces remodeling of the submucosa, generating susceptibility in nerves and triggering subsequent mast-cell activation associated with a maintained production and release of leukotrienes. 33 Eosinophils are one of the main sources of leukotrienes and have been related to enhanced levels of LTC 4 in bronchiolitis. 34 In our study, eosinophilia could not be evaluated, and perhaps this could be a differentiating characteristic of infants with wheezing after a viral respiratory infection. A deregulation of innate antiviral host defense based on eosinophils is another theory linking bronchiolitis and subsequent development of wheezing. 35 Although no statistically significant difference in PGE 2 levels was found between samples, the remarkably lower levels in the wheezing group during the acute infection are no less noteworthy. We hypothesized that recurrent wheezing development after a severe bronchiolitis may be related not only to maintained elevated LTC 4 levels, but rather to the lower PGE 2 levels during the acute infection, as PGE 2 can exert anti-inflammatory effects on lower airway inflammation. 36 Previous results indicate that the balance between both arms of arachidonic acid, 5-LO, and cyclooxygenase is critical to the resolution or development of lung damage. 37 Thus, we measured and have described a significant decrease in COX gene expression in the recovery period. COX-2 gene expression was increased during bronchiolitis episodes, a result found elsewhere. 38 This increase likely took place through activation of TLR3 by respiratory viruses; 39 thus, the viral clearance that takes place after the acute stage may explain the decrease in PGE 2 levels, as well as the lower expression of COX-2 observed in our study during this time.",

This pro-inflammatory response was likely mediated by activation of the TLR3-NF-\u03baB pathway. Moreover, we have also identified LTC 4 level as a differential element in the development of recurrent wheezing after bronchiolitis. However, more studies will be necessary to clarify the exact mechanism and the role of lipid mediators like LTC 4 and PGE 2 in evolution of these pathologies. ",
