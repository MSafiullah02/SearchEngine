Although some of these agents (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) have not led to endemicity, others (such as HIV) have joined the pantheon of microbes that continue to afflict us. Whooping cough\u2014induced mainly by Bordetella pertussis\u2014is a relatively recent addition to this ever-growing list of diseases. However, before the advent of vaccination, generations of physicians recognised whooping cough as a childhood disease with potentially deadly complications. In the vaccine era, this disease continues to be endemic and has shown a resurgence since the 1980s.1, 2, 3 Increased understanding of the origins of whooping cough and the factors that led to its rapid spread and persistence in human beings could lead to improved therapeutics or vaccines, or even insight in other diverse disciplines such as ecology, history, or anthropology.",

He described the earliest account of epidemic spread of the illness in Paris in 1578.14 He described an autumn and then a summer epidemic. The description of the summer epidemic is especially detailed and described a new disease that was termed \u201cquinta\u201d. This disease is clearly recognisable as whooping cough to modern clinicians. Children aged 4\u201310 years were mainly affected, with a violent dry cough that ended in vomiting (or cyanosis) with a high mortality. Ballonius states: \u201cThe lung is so irritated that in the effort it makes to get rid of that which affects it, it can inhale and exhale only with difficulty\u2026The patient swells up and nearly suffocated, feels as though his breath was stopped in the middle of his throat\u2026Some believe that this name [quinta] was made-up because of the sound of the patient in coughing. The torment of the cough is sometimes suspended for 4\u20135 hours after which the paroxysm returns, which is often so violent that it causes blood to issue from the nose and mouth and very frequently\u2026causes vomiting\u201d.11\n",

These include the 1540 epidemic in England, and a 1414 epidemic in Paris that caused coryza, hoarseness, and death (especially in elderly people). The 1414 Paris epidemic has been rejected as whooping cough by several scholars because of a missing mention of cough, absence of infant mortality, and the short-lived span of the epidemic (a maximum of 2 months) that seems more akin to influenza.11, 12, 15 A cough similar to whooping cough was also mentioned in a Korean medical and pharmaceutical textbook from 1433.16 However, we are not aware of description of any other associated symptoms or an epidemic disposition of this disease that would be consistent with whooping cough rather than croup. Although Bah\u0101' al-Dawlah R\u0101z\u012b is credited with having described whooping cough in 16th century Persia,17 his writing on the subject has not been examined in detail. Here, we describe three epidemics in 15th and 16th century Persia, the first of which is probably the first epidemic of whooping cough in Persia, and the earliest recorded whooping cough epidemic in the world, which at the time was probably becoming pandemic.",

In terms of symptoms, the disease caused the classic chronic non-productive cough. This cough was reported to end with vomiting or fainting, which are well known complications of the paroxysmal phase.

However, we will examine some notable differences in reference to both mortality and age cohort of those people affected.

We believe that the Herat epidemic probably represents the first such epidemic in Persia and probably denotes a time when this disease was becoming pandemic. The Paris epidemic might have likewise been the first in its region, because in the spring epidemic, a disease affecting mostly infants is not mentioned (implying that both adults and infants were infected). However, in the summer epidemic, infants were most affected by the disease. Most of the infants from Paris affected in the summer were probably those born in the spring, whose immunity by maternal transfer of antibody was waning.",

This association is reminiscent of what Ballonius would later describe in Paris (ie, a spring and then a summer epidemic). The descriptions of the Parisian and Persian epidemics, in that they spanned many different seasons, are compatible with our knowledge about whooping cough in the prevaccination era (ie, that the disease could be present in any season).6 Based on the assumption that the two epidemics that Ballonius described were both due to whooping cough, the short interval of weeks or months before the second epidemic happened might be a feature of an emerging whooping cough infection that infects a susceptible population.",
