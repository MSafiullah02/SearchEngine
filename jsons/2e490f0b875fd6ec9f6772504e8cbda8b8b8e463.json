However, there are few large prospective studies focused on HAdVs acute infections requiring hospitalization. From 2005 to 2013 a prospective study was conducted on children admitted with acute respiratory infections. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were taken for virological study by PCR and clinical data was recorded. HAdV specimens were genotyped. Frequency and clinical course of HAdV infections were compared with RSV, rhinovirus (RV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and influenza in the same population. HAdV was detected in 403 cases of 2371 confirmed viral infections (17.2%) , of which 154 were single virus infections (38%). We genotyped 154 HAdVs. The most frequent genotypes were HAdV-3 (24%), HAdV-6 (21%), and HAdV-5 (20%). A total of 262 children had fever (64.9%); 194 suffered hypoxia (48%), and 147 presented infiltrate in chest x-rays (36.4%). The most frequent diagnoses were recurrent wheezing or asthma (51.7%), bronchiolitis (18.3 %), and pneumonia (11.9%), and 46 (11.4%) episodes required prolonged hospitalization (>7 days) due to the severity. Adenovirus single infections were compared with single infections of 598 RSV, 494 RV, 83 influenza and 78 HBoV. Significant clinical differences were found between HAdV, RSV and RV infections.",

Different serotypes may be implicated in different clinical syndromes. Serotypes 1,2,3,5 and 7 have been described to be associated with pharyngitis. Pharyngoconjuntival fever is usually caused by serotypes 2,3,4 and 7, and pneumonia has been related to 3,7 and 21 [2, 4] .

All patients were evaluated by an attending physician and clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed. During the hospital stay, and as part of the study, a physician filled out a study-questionnaire with the clinical data. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was diagnosed in patients with: rhinorrhea and/or cough and no signs of wheezing, dyspnea, crackles or bronchodilator use, with or without fever. Asthma was diagnosed on the basis of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines [8] . All other episodes of acute expiratory wheezing were considered to be recurrent wheezing. Acute expiratory wheezing was considered to be bronchiolitis when it occurred for the first time in children aged under 2 years. Laryngotracheobronchitis was associated with inspiratory dyspnea and wheezing. Laryngitis was associated with inspiratory dyspnea without wheezing. Cases with both focal infiltrates and consolidation in chest X-rays were, in the absence of wheezing, classified as pneumonia.",

            "text": "HAdV infections are found in an important proportion of the hospitalized children with respiratory illnesses (17% in our series), and circulate mainly in spring and December. They are associated with characteristic clinical data, such as higher and more prolonged fever, recurrent wheezing or pneumonias and elevated acute phase reactants, and frequently require antibiotic treatment. There is a fairly significant proportion (11.4%) of HAdV cases that are severe enough to require prolonged hospitalization of more than 7 days, mainly caused by hypoxia. In our country, the different genotypes are not related to specific diagnoses, although HAdV 2,3,5 and 6 are the most frequent in our patients. Although clinical characteristics are similar to influenza and bocavirus infections, seasonality and epidemics could lead us to consider one or another virus. On the other hand, RV and RSV infections are clinically and epidemiologically different from HAdV infections in children.",
