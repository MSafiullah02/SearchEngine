            "text": "Epidemics of influenza occur annually in the United States, typically between late fall and early spring. Surveillance data suggest influenza is responsible for nearly three quarters of a million hospitalizations, 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and over 25,000 deaths annually [1]. Children under two years of age and adults over the age of 65 years are at highest risk of adverse outcomes. Additionally, the presence of chronic medical conditions, immunosuppression, pregnancy, and obesity may also increase the risk of adverse outcome. The predominant seasonal influenza A virus subtypes in circulation since 1977 have been H1N1 and H3N2. However, since the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, the predominant seasonal influenza A is the 2009 H1N1 virus strain. It is this strain that has resulted in increased disease severity related to influenza.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends antiviral treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness or who require hospitalization [5]. Oseltamivir and zanamavir are recommended based on data indicating >99% of circulating strains are sensitive to these medications. Sporadic oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections have been identified; however, the known impact has been limited.

This interest has been born out of concerns regarding absorption of oseltamivir in critically ill patients and perhaps improved efficacy of the higher dose. A pharmacokinetic study sought to evaluate plasma concentrations of oseltamivir administered orally or via nasogastric tube in critically ill patients with H1N1 [12]. Serum levels of oseltamivir free base and its carboxylate metabolite were measured at baseline and then 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 h after the fourth oseltamivir dose or later. Of the 41 included patients, 73% received enteral nutrition and 32% were on vasopressor therapy. The authors found serum concentrations of active oseltamivir carboxylate metabolite that were similar to levels seen in ambulatory patients. Therefore, it is likely trough concentrations were above the theorized pharmacodynamic threshold for maximal inhibition of the virus, though the authors did not report these values. Furthermore, there was no correlation between body weight and area under the curve for volume of distribution suggesting dose adjustments are not required for obesity.",

The primary endpoint was the absence of viral RNA in a combined nasal and throat swab on day 5. The study included both pediatric and adult patients and doses of oseltamivir were adjusted in those weighing <40 kg. All patients received five days of oseltamivir, while those meeting criteria for clinical failure at day 5 received an additional five days of therapy. The majority (246/326, 75%) of enrolled patients were children with a median age of 2 years. Influenza A was present in 260 (79.8%) patients, 133 (40.8%) with A/H3N2, 72 (22.1%) with A/H1N1 pdm09, 38 (11.7%) with seasonal A/H1N1, and 17 (5.2%) with A/H5N1. ICU admission was required in 57 (17.5%) patients and 34 (10.4%) required mechanical ventilation. At day five, the proportion of patients with a negative viral RNA was similar between the double dose (72.3%) and standard dose (68.2%) groups (p = .42). Between the double dose and standard dose groups, there was also no difference in clinical failure at day 5 (9.9% vs. 13%, p = .44) or mortality (7.3% vs. 5.6%, p = .54). The majority of deaths were in patients with avian H5N1 virus. This study does not support differences in clinical or virologic outcomes when higher doses of oseltamivir are used, although these results can only be primarily applied to the pediatric population.",

A prospective pharmacokinetic study of 13 patients on either continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) or ECMO evaluated the pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentrations of oseltamivir in these patients [15]. All patients in this study received oseltamivir 150 mg twice daily. Serum samples were obtained at regular intervals following drug administration just before the hemodialyzer (CVVHD) or directly before and after the oxygenator (ECMO). CVVHD contributed significantly to the clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate while pre- and post\u2011oxygenator concentrations of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate did not differ. The authors found a higher oseltamivir carboxylate area under the curve for the 12-hour dosing interval (AUC0\u201312) than would be expected in non-critically ill patients receiving the same dosage regimen. The dose utilized resulted in higher median AUC0\u201312 levels than would be expected in non-critically ill patients receiving the same regimen. The authors stated the 75 mg twice daily dose of oseltamivir would be reasonable in patients on CVVHD at similar effluent rates to those used in this analysis (3300 \u00b1 919 mL/h). Furthermore, AUC0\u201312 was lower in patients receiving both CVVHD and ECMO compared to patients receiving only CVVHD. The study population may have been too small to draw firm conclusions regarding oseltamivir dosing in ECMO; however, the authors speculated that higher dose may be required in these patients, particularly when gastrointestinal dysfunction may be present.",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that antiviral therapy be maintained until satisfactory clinical improvement [16].

Prolonged viral shedding has been noted to be present beyond the 5\u20137 days in hospitalized patients with influenza [17]. Given the lack of clinical data, it may be reasonable to extend the duration of oseltamivir beyond five days in patients with severe influenza and delayed clinical response.

Cases were those patients hospitalized in an ICU for \u226524 h with acute respiratory infection and laboratory evidence of H1N1 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A comparative analysis was performed in critically ill patients treated with NAIs, but who did not receive peramivir. Of 1684 patients who received treatment with an NAI, 57 (3%) received IV peramivir. Of these 57 patients, 95% were on mechanical ventilation and 25% had suspected bacterial co-infection. The majority of these cases received a concurrent second antiviral, most commonly oseltamivir. Time from symptom onset to treatment with an oral NAI was 4 days and from symptom onset to peramivir was 9 days. The most common reasons for initiation of peramivir were \u201cnot responded to oral or inhaled antivirals\u201d (75%) and \u201csuspected malabsorption\u201d (12%). Twenty-nine patients (51%) who received peramivir died. Patients who died after receiving peramivir were more likely to be diagnosed with acute renal failure (p = .02), have a shorter length of hospital stay (16 vs. 31 days; p = .002), and receive peramivir for a shorter duration (7 vs. 9 days; p = .02) compared to survivors who received peramivir. Patients who received peramivir were compared to 1627 cases in the ICU treated with NAIs, but not peramivir. Patients treated with peramivir had a higher rate of obesity and morbid obesity, and were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p = .0002) or sepsis (p < .0001), to require mechanical ventilation (p < .0001), and to die (p < .0001).

Critically ill patients were defined as those admitted to an ICU or requiring mechanical ventilation with a PaO2:FiO2 ratio < 300 and who required infusion of an inotropic or vasoactive medication. Patients were divided into two groups based on initial treatment with either peramivir (n = 34) or oseltamivir (n = 26). The average age was 68 years and 55% were male. At baseline, patients who received peramivir had a higher SOFA score (11 vs. 8.5) and a higher proportion of patients were in shock (64.7% vs. 38.5%). Patients who received oseltamivir were more likely to have chronic heart disease (38.5% vs. 8.8%). Influenza A was predominant in both groups with 85.3% in the peramivir group and 88.5% in the oseltamivir group. Peramivir was changed to oseltamivir in 15 patients (44.1%), primarily due to clinical improvement while in the ICU. Oseltamivir was changed to peramivir in 13 patients (50%) and eleven of these patients had progression of pneumonia. Half of patients treated with peramivir received a 600 mg dose while 65.4% of oseltamivir patients received a 75 mg dose. The median duration of antiviral therapy was 9.5 days in the peramivir group and 11 days in the oseltamivir group. Between the peramivir and oseltamivir groups, there was no difference in ICU mortality (38.2% vs. 30.8%; p = .548), in-hospital mortality (44.1% vs. 38.5%; p = .660) or ICU or hospital length of stay. In multivariate analysis increasing age was associated with 28-day mortality, but peramivir use was not. The authors concluded that critically ill patients with severe influenza can be treated with either intravenous peramivir or enteral oseltamivir depending on the most appropriate route of administration with no difference in outcomes; although the study may have lacked adequate power to detect differences in these outcomes.",

Kim et al. retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 127 patients who required mechanical ventilation during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Korea. Twenty four of these patients received treatment with combination oseltamivir 150 mg twice daily, amantadine 100 mg twice daily, and ribavirin 300 mg thrice daily and 103 received oseltamivir monotherapy [28]. While there were no significant adverse safety concerns, the authors found that triple antiviral therapy did not reduce mortality and overall outcomes were similar to those who received just oseltamivir monotherapy. No virologic endpoints were assessed in this study. In a double-blinded fashion, Beigel et al. randomized patients to receive triple therapy with oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily, amantadine 100 mg twice daily, and ribavirin 600 mg twice daily, or oseltamivir monotherapy [29].

Nevertheless, 30-day mortality was reduced in the experimental group (0.9% vs. 8.2%, p = .01) and the experimental therapy was the only independent factor associated with lower 30-day mortality in multivariate analyses.
