            "text": "World Health Organization has documented almost 405,000 deaths including 228 million infections globally towards human malaria disease [1]. Five diverse species of Plasmodium, i.e., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, as well as P. knowlesi are culprit for the disease outbreak in which P. falciparum has stood first for lethality. About 99.7 and 62.8% disease cases were documented merely for P. falciparum (Pf) in African as well as South-East Asia realms, respectively, which further supports the above fact [2]. In recent findings, P. vivax has also been found capable to develop severe malaria amongst populations living in sub-tropical countries [3]. The only preferred option is cost intensive chemotherapy for human malaria [4,5]. The reason being the fact that currently, none of cutting-edge effective human malaria vaccine is accessible, which can provide protection towards most of the world-wide population together with endemic regions. On the other hand, the exhaustive research from decades has led to development of total 44 malaria vaccines together with 19 subunit, 10 DNA, 10 recombinant vector, 1 recombinant protein as well as 4 live/attenuated vaccine preparations, of which, merely 7 vaccines are revealed for human host (http://www.violinet.org/). Most of these vaccines are either single or multi-antigens derived from various life-cycle stages of the parasites P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. yoelii, P. berghei and P. chabaudi [6,7]. For instance, Pf vaccine combination involves multi-antigens namely MSP1, MSP2 and RESA derived from blood-stage [8], while NYVAC-Pf7 includes antigens CS, SSP2, LSA1, MSP1, AMA1, SERA as well as Pfs25 from multi-stage of pathogenic life-cycle [9]. Besides these, P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue 5 (PfRH5) was also reported as good antigen for development of malaria vaccine [10,11] that elicits human monoclonal antibody in vaccine trial [12]. Most of the aforesaid vaccines were found to elicit immune responses, but unfortunately, failed to clear phase-III clinical trial owing to rapid waning of vaccine efficacy due to geographical antigenic variation and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allelic diversity [3,[13], [14], [15]]. Apart from these, apoptosis of infected erythrocytes and their inability to express HLA class I molecules on cell surface that assists in avoiding cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) response is also another aspect [[16], [17], [18]]. Thus, there is pressing need towards the development of innovative vaccines using reverse vaccinology together with immunoinformatics that can target majority of the stages of parasite's life-cycle including species level conservation so as to cover the world-wide human population [19].",

            "text": "In last two decades, the reverse vaccinology strategy has been extensively exploited by world-wide research groups for genome-wide screening of vaccine antigens against several pathogens like Neisseria meningitides serogroup B, P. falciparum, Leishmania and so on [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. It has been synergistically progressive with onset of immunoinformatics which is another cost-effective and quicker strategy towards prediction of B- as well as T-cell epitopes present on antigenic proteins and targeted population coverage analysis [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. In recent years, the aforementioned strategies have been used very frequently in designing of novel vaccines by various researchers against different diseases like Dengue [30], Schistosomiasis [31], Fascioliasis [32], Encephalitis [33], Lassa fever [34], Neonatal meningitis [35] and H7N9 influenza A [36]. Furthermore, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), e.g., TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 typically present in plasma membrane of host cell recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that provokes phagocytosis and develop innate immune responses through production of cytokines, interleukins, and antibodies that prohibit the parasite entry in pre-erythrocytic stage of malaria [[37], [38], [39], [40]]. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first computational studies for designing of multi-epitope based oral vaccine against human malaria. Overall, this investigation focuses on the designing of 15 innovative polypeptide vaccines (PVs) utilizing predicted B- and/or T-cell epitopes sourced from 5 genome derived predicted antigenic proteins (GDPAP) assembled together with specific linkers and adjuvants towards P. falciparum malaria [24].",

In this context, the exploitation of computational approaches is not only cost-effective for vaccine development but also diminishes time period and risk of failure in experimental studies [26,27,65,66]. In this study, 82 continuous B cell epitopes were forecasted from 5 GDPAP using BCPREDS (Supplementary Table S1). These 82 continuous B cell epitopes were found to possess total 433 T-cell epitopes including 142 HLA class I epitopes and 291 HLA class II epitopes (Supplementary Table S2). These T-cell epitopes were forecasted from the pool of predicted continuous B-cell epitopes as the antigen presentation to T-cells was supposed to be more efficient if it is recognized by the B-cell. In addition, an antigen-specific B-cell may present multiple T-cell epitopes to the immune system and, thus enhances its ability to be triggered in a specific manner [[67], [68], [69]]. Further, based on the PPC analysis an epitope ensemble of 13 HLA class I epitopes with 98.75% and 3 HLA class II epitopes with 56.85% world coverage were designed using criteria described previously (Table 2) [24]. However, a combined set of 16 HLA class I and II epitope ensemble revealed human population coverage of highest 99.46% and lowest 94.47% for world and South America, respectively (Fig. 2). The aforementioned criteria involved the screening of cross-presented epitopes amongst different set of HLA binding alleles in a selected population with higher PPC and VaxiJen score. The technique of identifying such \u2018promiscuous\u2019 epitopes that cover diverse HLA alleles of affected population are highly desirable as they could enhance the vaccine efficacy [51]. Concerning HLA class I epitope ensemble of P. falciparum, epitopes YTLTAGVCV (T1) and YFNDDIKQF (T5) covered 56.56% and 39.26% of world population were also reported in similar study conducted by Pritam et al. [24].",

Besides these, TLRs are also involved in the activation of different signalling cascade that ultimately express the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-\u03b3, etc. [71]. The IFN-\u03b3 is associated with depletion of liver-stage parasites [72,73]. This is also supported by present study, where the epitopes T2, T7, T8, T10, T11 and T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T11, T12, T13, T14, T16 were found to induce the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses, correspondingly (Supplementary Table S3).

            "text": "\nLinear B-cell epitopes is linked to antibody generation, where identification of such epitopes using traditional approaches is not only costly but also time consuming with involvement of difficult processes [75]. In order to overcome aforementioned issues, the present study involved the prediction of T-cell epitopes using linear B-cell epitopes as input instead of whole antigen so as to minimize not only the size of PV but also elicit both cellular (T cell epitope) as well as humoral (B- cell epitope) immune responses. Further, the non toxic nature of adjuvants A and B also helps in production of several cytokines (e.g., INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12) through induction of dendritic cell, B cell, macrophage and T-cell, which ultimately boost the concentration of the antibodies reported in several studies linked to various disease causing agents including human rotavirus, HIV, Helicobacter pylori, Influenza virus [[76], [77], [78], [79]]. Therefore, 15 PVs were designed through epitope ensemble of T cell epitopes and/or linear B-cell epitopes having epitope ensemble with different linkers as well as adjuvants, which are responsible for the activation of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors pertaining to malaria. Initially, five non-adjuvant PVs (PV1-PV5) were designed followed by incorporation of TLR2 and TLR4 binding specific adjuvants that resulted into respective design of 10 adjuvant PVs, i.e., PV1A-PV5A and PV1B-PV5B (Table 3\n). Further, EAAAK linker was incorporated at N-terminal of PVs as it is stiff and prevents the assembly of adjuvant with other vaccine domain [80,81]. Although, the adjuvants are found to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines but they may cause toxicity/adverse reaction. Therefore, we have designed 5 PVs without adjuvants, where the designing of PV1 having only T cell epitopes (HLA class I and II) and they were joined together by using linker L2 and L3. Likewise, in PV2, we have exploited merely linear B-cell epitopes attached together with linker L3. Similarly in PV3, both T- and B- cell epitopes were joined with linkers L2 and L3 while, in PV4, we have exploited merely linear B- cell epitopes attached together with linker L2. Amongst these two linkers, L3 is a universal linker, which can enhance the proteasome processing along with immunogenicity, while L2 is a flexible linker that can stimulate better immune response [42,77,82]. As exemplary vaccine is found to induce multi-immune response (B- and T-cell immune response), therefore in the designing of further PVs both the T- and B- cell epitopes were used so as to elicit humoral/cellular response [83]. The PV3 and PV5 were differing from each other with respect to linkers L3 and L2, respectively used for joining continuous B- cell epitopes. However, in case of designing a negative polypeptide vaccine control, linkers L2 and L3 were employed to connect non-HLA class I and II T cell epitopes (Table 3). Fig. 3 (a, b)depicts the exemplar design of PV1 and PV3 with adjuvants A and B i.e., PV1A and PV3B. The advantage of using linkers and adjuvants used in the present study for designing of multi-epitope malaria PVs have been also revealed by several contemporary researchers against other diseases [36,84,85] to enhance the antigen processing and presentation ability as well as immunogenicity. Also, the cost effective Cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant is cytokines inducer (Th1 and Th2 response) which increases the antibody titration [86]. Thus, the use of both T cell and B cell epitopes together with linkers and adjuvants can increase the potential of PVs towards induction of multi immune responses.",

            "text": "The TLRs, especially the surface one, viz. TLR2 as well as TLR4 are available not only on the immune cells, but also on epithelial cells and fibroblasts that recognizes PAMPs and bridge the innate as well as adaptive immunity of the host by regulating the balance between Th1 and Th2 type of responses [[87], [88], [89], [90]]. For example, the merozoites stage of P. falciparum releases glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored surface antigens which act as ligands recognized by both TLR1-TLR2 heterodimers and TLR4 homodimers of host immune cells. Such events indeed results in decreasing the parasitic load from host by triggering the production of various pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as antibody isotype switching [[38], [39], [40],91,92,]. Thus, for enhanced protection, selection of respective TLR2 and 4 mucosal protein adjuvant A (CTB) and B (50s ribosomal L7/L12) in designed PVs could be the good choice against P. falciparum [77,78,86,93]. Even combining two distinct TLR agonists into an adjuvanted subunit vaccine have showed synergetic protective efficacy [94,95]. Altogether, these facts led to the hypothesis of using both TLR2 and 4 receptors agonists A and B, respectively in the designed PVs and subsequently docking experiment was performed to reveal the possible association amongst PVs and TLR [96,97]. For molecular docking, the tertiary structures of 15 PVs were predicted that revealed >80% of amino acids in favoured regions. Overall 22 docking studies were carried out using ClusPro2.0 tool including control C1 and C2 against receptors TLR2 and TLR4, respectively (Table 4\n). This resulted into total 18 docked models, i.e., M1 to M18 including 16 PVs and 2 controls. It is quite interesting to note that the PVs designed without adjuvants were also able to interact (dock) with TLR2 and TLR4 (having good energy scores) over control except PV3. Therefore, they might be capable to elicit innate immunity [[98], [99], [100]], which are in well agreement with earlier studies regarding the rapid production of IFN-\u03b3 [101,102]. Amongst 15 designed PVs, PV3, PV5A and PV4B were not able to dock by ClusPro tool with their respective receptors. So, a total 12 potential PVs with 16 docked models were obtained for TLR2-TLR1 (M2-M9) and TLR4-MD2 (M11-M18). The docking energy of control models M1 (\u2212685.9 Kcal/mol) and M10 (\u2212794.9 Kcal/mol) for complexes TLR2-TLR1-C1 and TLR4-MD2-C2 were found higher over designed potential PVs, which indicates that all the docked PVs have formed stronger immunological complexes over control ligands. Amongst the designed PVs without adjuvants (PV1, PV2, PV4 and PV5), PV4 showed the lowest docking energies \u22121047.4 Kcal/mol and \u22121070.7 Kcal/mol with respect to TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, correspondingly. These clearly indicated that the PVs without adjuvants have interacting domain to induce innate immune system. This is in agreement with the recent study where human TLR4-derived self-assembling peptide nanoparticles have been used as non toxic vaccine adjuvant with filarial antigenic protein to induce the immunological responses in mice [103]. Besides these, the linker L2 has been utilized in the designing of PV1A, PV3B and PV4 which can provide better flexibility during interaction as compare to L1 and L3. Amongst the two adjuvants used in designing of PVs, average docking score of PVs (PV1, PV2 and PV3) involving cholera toxin B subunit was lower (\u22121190.3 Kcal/mol) compare to PVs (PV1, PV2 and PV3) involving 50S ribosomal L7/L12 (\u22121173.3 Kcal/mol) (Table 4). However, based on overall docking score, PV1A (\u22121275.5) and PV3B (\u22121269.2) against receptors TLR2 and TLR4, respectively were selected as leading PVs for further structural and functional analysis (Fig. 4\n).",

            "text": "The negative GRAVY values of both PVs PV1A (\u22120.377) and PV3B (\u22120.479) were pointing towards their hydrophilic nature (that exposed on outer surface) and, therefore may elicit elevated humoral immune response [93]. Generally, in vitro protein stability is determined by instability index <40. Considering this, the present study depicted PV1A and PV3B as stable proteins with their corresponding instability index values of 36.35 and 26.22. However, in vivo half-life of PV1A and PV3B showed >10 h and, therefore reflecting the stabilities of these two PVs, which might enhance the durability as well as strength of immune response [104,105]. The leading PVs, i.e., PV1A and PV3B were predicted as probable antigens in this study using several antigenicity forecasting tools viz. VaxiJen, ANTIGENpro, protein antigenicity prediction and Secret-AAR including SPAN at default threshold values. Nevertheless, non-allergenicity of PV1A and PV3B were forecasted by AllergenFP tool at threshold value >0.8. Also, the secondary structure analysis (SSA) of a protein is beneficial for understanding its folding, stability as well as function [[106], [107], [108], [109], [110]]. In this context, the present study revealed alpha helices of 31.31 and 25.75%, \u03b2-strands of 9.89 and 16.71% and coils of 58.79 and 57.53% for PV1A and PV3B, respectively (Fig. 5). The predicted tertiary structures of PV1A and PV3B were refined by ModRefiner tool in which the Ramachandran plot exhibited respective favoured regions of 92.3 and 91.4% as well as allowed regions of 6 and 5.7%. These values indicated high quality and stability of refined protein structure model based on Ramachandran plot as described previously [111] (Fig. 6). Further, PV1A and PV3B were forecasted to possess respective 8 and 18 linear as well as 104 and 315 discontinuous B cell epitopes at default thresholds (Supplementary Table S4). These leading PVs were also predicted to be involved in multi-organism process as well as cell adhesion and immune system process, respectively, as predicted by DeepGOPlus tool which is based on deep convolutional neural network model and Gene Ontology (GO) scheme. The overall structural and functional analysis of leading PVs showed comparatively similar properties over positive vaccine controls C3 and C4 (Table 5). Thus, the leading polypeptide vaccines PV1A and PV3B have the capability to induce both humoral as well as cellular immune responses. However, the orally administered polypeptide vaccines suffer from the poor stability, insolubility, weak bioavailability and low immunogenicity due to acidic environment of the upper GI-tract and inefficient delivery to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Therefore, genetically engineered L. lactis expression host can be used for production and delivery of vaccine antigens due to several advantageous properties viz. easy and safe production as well as storage, survival in gastric environment and self-adjuvanticity [112,113].",

In addition, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, natural killer cells and macrophages were activated by elicitation of IL-4, which helps to control pathogen effect [115,116]. Even, the most successful vaccine candidate of malaria, RTS,S was reported to elicit IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IgG titers, activation of CD4+ T cell responses [72,117]. In this background, the present study involved the immune simulations of PV1A and PV3B using C-ImmSim tool along with the positive vaccine controls (C3, C4) (Table 6). The C3 is a self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle (SAPN) based P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidate that elicit IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-10 and IgG antibody titers in mice [48,118]. The C4 is a novel fusion protein of Staphylococcus aureus that indicated a high titer of specific antibodies (IgG1 and IgG2a) responses and decrease the viable cell counts through elicitation of mixture of Th1, Th2, and Th17 immune responses. The simulation results were displayed no alteration in antigen level as well as immunogenic responses except generation of IFN-\u03b3 against negative control (C5). While the positive vaccine controls as well as PV1A/PV3B showed drastic decrease in antigen counts that ultimately reached to zero after 5th day of injection (Supplementary Fig. 1). Besides these, they were also involved in the elicitation of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes and macrophages responses that lead to generation of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12) as well as antibody titration (IgG + IgM and IgG1 + IgG2).",

These results agree well with the earlier finding of Shey et al. [66]. Utilizing similar in silico approach, the leading PVs designed and characterized in the present study was compared with the wet lab experimental data of Kaba et al. [48] and Ahmadi et al. [49] (Table 6). The predicted result of immune simulation indicated the elicitation of macrophages, B and T lymphocytes for the production of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12) as well as antibodies (IgG + IgM and IgG1 + IgG2) against proposed top two PVs which seems to be similar observations obtained by aforementioned research group in mice. Fig. 7\nsummarizes the comparative account on immune simulations of C3, C4 with one of leading PVs (PV1A) having higher potential to induce protective immune responses that might be owing to use of Cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant. Therefore, designing strategy used in PV1A/PV3B could be highly effective in stimulation immune responses. Moreover, validity of immunoinformatics tools for prediction of epitopes, protective immune response analysis, constructing chimeric multi-epitope vaccine, assessment of vaccine safety as well as efficacy and immunization modelling have been exercised in the last five years with >500 literatures in the PMC database that assisted in the preclinical and clinical studies of several vaccine project including Hepatitis B Virus, Dengue, Schistosoma haematobium, Treponema pallidum, S. aureus, Trypanosoma cruzi, Helicobacter pylori, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Zika virus [26,45,119,120]. Therefore, the use of bioinformatics tools for prediction of antigenicity, epitopes and molecular interaction are convenient and adequate approach in vaccine design and development [47,84,121].",

            "text": "When an antigen interacts with antibody it induces the humoral immune response and helps in clearance of pathogen. The IgG antibodies (named in order of decreasing abundance IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) are one of the most abundant pathogens neutralizing molecules found in human serum. These antibodies share >90% amino acid sequence identity but each subclass has exclusive effector properties including half-life, epitope binding, immunological complex formation, complement activation, triggering of effector cells and placental transport. Moreover, the IgG profile of a given individual is determined by their inherited allotypes that can potentially influence the clinical manifestation of the immune response [122]. However, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been found in a rare population of patients that control the infection [[123], [124], [125]]. These bNAbs tend to target different conserved antigenic regions exposed on the outer surfaces of a pathogen across the circulating strains. Here, in the present study, a protein-protein global docking method (ClusPro server) was used to reveal the shape complementarity between PVs (as ligands) and the interacting domains of antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 (as the receptors) to eliminate the need of a long term exposure of malaria patients to selected antigen mimetics PV1A and PV3B involving the epitopes (B1, B4 and B5) of P. falciparum strains. These antibodies could be considered as bNAbs if they found with a well detectable neutralization activity in wet lab experimental studies [[126], [127], [128], [129], [130]]. Furthermore, the respective source proteins P28, P25 and MSP1of epitopes B1, B4 and B5 have been characterized as leading vaccine candidates [130,131]. Also, the antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 have been found associated with human malaria protection [132,133]. Thus, a structure based vaccinology approach could be exploited to predict the probability of potent PVs that might be able to block infection even more effectively [134]. These data lead to provoke the molecular interaction studies of leading PVs (PV1A as well as PV3B) along with co-crystallized control epitopes towards antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 (Table 7\nand Fig. 8\nB1- B6). For IgG1 and IgG3 antibody the obtained lowest score for molecular docking of IgG1 and IgG3 control was \u2212449.4 and \u2212 630.9, correspondingly. The obtained ClusPro docking energies and PatchDock scores of PV1A and PV3B against both antibody receptors IgG1 and IgG3 were found lower as compared to their respective controls C6 and C7 (Table 7). Besides these, PV1A showed hydrogen bond interaction through amino acids Leu-9, Val-13, Phe-15 and Lys-326, Asp-329 of B5 epitope with antibody receptors IgG1 and IgG3, correspondingly. Moreover, PV3B exhibited similar interaction with IgG1 and IgG3 through Gly-255, Gly-280 and Gly-525 of B1, Leu-551 of B4, respectively [135].",

            "text": "Molecular dynamics study is crucially for evaluating the stability of the protein-protein complex which can be determined by comparing necessary protein dynamics to their normal modes [136]. The NMA allowed the demonstration of docked protein-protein complex mobility and stabilization. Fig. 9(a, b) showed the 3D interaction model of respective polypeptide vaccines PV1A and PV3B complexed with TLR2 and TLR4. The direction of each amino acid residue was given by arrows and the length of the arrow corresponded to the degree of mobility. It also provided the profiles of deformability (c, d), mobility (e, f), eigenvalue (g, h), variance map (i, j), covariance matrix (k, l) and elastic network (m, n). The value of NMA-B-factors (mobility) indicated the relative amplitude of the atomic displacements around the equilibrium conformation. While the deformability calculated the gradient of the atomic displacements summed over all modes at every atomic position. High values are expected in flexible regions such as hinges or linkers between domains, whereas low values usually correspond to rigid parts. The obtained higher and lower values of maximum mobility and deformability for PV3B (2.038E+02, 1.088E\u221206) indicated towards more flexible regions compare to PV1A (3.443E+01, 4.740E\u221206). The eigenvalue associated to each normal mode represented the motion stiffness. Lower the eigenvalue, easier the deformation i.e., lower energy is required to deform the complex structure. The respective eigenvalues for PV1A and PV3B complexed with TLR2 and TLR4 were found 1.064E\u221206 and 7.498E\u221209 that indicated the greater stability of complex PV1A-TLR2. The individual and cumulative variances associated to each normal mode were inversely related to the eigenvalue. The covariance matrix indicated the coupling between pairs of residues, i.e. whether they experience correlated (red), uncorrelated (white) or anti-correlated (blue) motions whereas elastic network graph characterizes pairs of atoms connected by springs and each dot in the graph represented one spring between the corresponding pair of atoms [137].",

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) values for PV1A and PV3B were 0.9857 and 0.9584, respectively. For reliable optimization of codon, CAI value should lie between 0.9 and 1.0 [138]. However, the GC content of improved DNA sequence of PV1A and PV3B were found 42.12% and 43.12% which are lying in the optimal range (30% to 70%) that could be easily expressed in any suitable expression host [139]. Although, P. falciparum antigens could be expressed in E. coli but require the codon harmonization (reduction of amino acid misincorporation) to improve the immunogenicity [140]. In the present study, the solubilisation probability of recombinant proteins (PV1A and PV3B) to be expressed in E. coli revealed by bioinformatics tools RPSP, Protein-Sol, CamSol and SOLPro was lower compare to positive vaccine controls (C3, C4) that indicated to look for alternative expression host (Table 5). Additionally, L. lactis was used as expression host alternative to E. coli due to following advantageous properties i) generally recognized as safe (GRAS) microorganism ii) lack of outer membrane (iii) insignificant extracellular proteolysis activity (iv) free of endotoxins (v) no lipo-polysaccharide contamination (vii) accommodates cysteine-rich proteins (vii) accessibility of both inducible and constitutive genetic control systems (viii) able to express prone-to-aggregate and/or difficult-to-purify proteins (ix) presentation to the host immune system in the context of micro-particles to avoids the immunotolerance which is normally provoked by oral delivery of soluble antigens (x) exhibits similar codon bias to P. falciparum which makes it efficient protein expression and secretion system to outer surface that could easily interact with host immune system [113,[141], [142], [143]]. In recent years, several wet lab studies have confirmed the utilization of L. lactis as an expression host to produce properly folded, pure and stable chimeric and/or single antigenic proteins of many pathogens that elicited high levels of functional antibodies/cytokines including P. falciparum [[144], [145], [146], [147], [148]], Mycobacterium bovis [149], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [150], Helicobacter pylori [151], Polish avian H5H1 influenza [152], cancer [153] and Staphylococcus aureus [154]. Moreover, L. lactis-mediated delivery of DNA vaccines also lead to the expression of post-translationally modified antigens by host cells resulting in presentation of conformationally restricted epitopes to the immune system for induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses [112].",

Finally, the size of PV1A and PV3B recombinant DNA (obtained after insertion of cDNA into pIL1 expression vector) was observed as 7477 bp and 8377 bp, respectively which lies inside the ORF and could be translated into respective protein sequences with four additional amino acids (MCKC) at the N-terminus (Fig. 10\n). Therefore, an ideal multi-epitope polypeptide vaccine should compose of a series of epitopes and or adjuvants that can elicit simultaneous and strong innate and adaptive (humoral and cellular) immune responses involving T and B cells responses against a targeted pathogen of malaria. In contrast to traditional killed/live attenuated or single-epitope vaccines, multi-epitope vaccines have distinctive properties such as involvement of numerous HLA-restricted epitopes derived from different antigens of various Plasmodium species/strains that can be recognized by various T cells, bringing of additional components with adjuvant capability to enhance the immunogenicity as well as long-lasting immunity and reduction of unnecessary parts that can trigger the pathogenicity/adverse effects. Well-designed multi-epitope vaccines with such advantages should become powerful prophylactic and therapeutic agents against malaria infections. However, the present problems in the field of multi-epitope vaccine design include the selection of appropriate candidate antigens and systematic arrangement of their immunodominant epitopes for effective oral delivery through virus-like particles and SAPN. The present study successfully utilized the immunoinformatics tools for prediction of suitable epitope ensemble of target proteins for designing a multi-epitope malaria oral vaccine.",
