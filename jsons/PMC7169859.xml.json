            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel pathogen in the family Coronaviridae, genus Deltacoronavirus, causing enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhoea similar to porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) (Jung et al., 2015). PDCoV was first discovered in Hong Kong in 2012, during a study to identify novel coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2012). In February 2014, PDCoV was first detected and reported in Ohio, United States, in association with PED cases. The retrospective investigation demonstrated the presence of PDCoV in the USA as early as 2013 (Sinha et al., 2015). Since then, PDCoV has been detected in most pig\u2010producing states of the USA (Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Homwong et al., 2016). Recently, PDCoV was identified for the first time in South Korea and China (Lee and Lee, 2014; Song et al., 2015), and the identification of PDCoV in China was dated back to 2004 (Dong et al., 2015). Increased identification of PDCoV raises concerns regarding the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this virus. We herein report the identification and molecular characterization of PDCoV identified from piglets with clinical diarrhoea in swine farms in South\u2010East Asian countries (SEAC) including Thailand, Vietnam, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Philippines.",

Since the emergence of PED, several pig farms in SEAC have experienced sporadic outbreaks of diarrhoea in piglets more than once a year. The causative agent was considered to be a variant of PEDV. The role of PDCoV in the outbreak, although suspected, was not investigated at that time. PDCoV was suspected when rebreaks of clinical enteric disease similar to PED occurred every two months in some herds, which is too frequent compared to the period of six\u2010month protection reported earlier (Goede et al., 2015). PDCoV has since been investigated in addition to the detection of PEDV.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the study reported the identification of PDCoV in SEAC including Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam and Philippines. The PDCoVs isolated from Thailand and Lao PDR form their own cluster, separated from China and US PDCoV, but relatively were more closely related to the isolates from China than to US PDCoV. In contrast, the PDCoVs isolated from Vietnam were more closely related to the isolates from the USA. The results of the study suggested that the viruses from these three SEAC might originate from different ancestors. The identification of PDCoV in SEAC suggests that the virus may have been in this region for some time, but has not been detected due to greater focus on PEDV variants. Although PDCoV was not detected in Philippines, it does not mean the virus was not there due to limited sample numbers from this area. The origin and source of introduction into Thailand, Lao PDR and Vietnam are still questionable. The viruses could have been in this region for some time, and continuously evolved until separated into different lineage, or the viruses were introduced from different ancestors or sources. Further retrospective investigations are urgently needed to elucidate source and evolution. In addition, further analysis and molecular epidemiology based on the complete genome sequence, and pathogenicity studies of PEDV and PDCoV co\u2010infection are urgently needed.",
