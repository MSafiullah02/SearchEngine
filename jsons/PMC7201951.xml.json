This review substantially aimed at investigating if children adhere to social isolation or continue to mix with others, limiting the effects of school closure and of quarantine. This is an important topic, the of dark side of which resides on effects of prolonged school closure on well-being of children, poorly considered in the current public debate on management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [2]. In this perspective, mental health of children and adolescents undergoes a sudden stress test during school closure, with increased risk of loneliness, addiction to videogames and binge watching, alteration of circadian rhythms, direct or assisted domestic violence, and academic achievement gaps. Especially for the latter, inequalities related to socioeconomic status and differences related to pre-existing vulnerabilities will be further amplified [2-4].",

Two intertwined main obstacles for the generalisability of findings relate to the geographic expansion of the pandemic and to the temporal duration of school closures. Examined studies were almost entirely based on experiences in context with the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic or other influenza-like outbreaks, that did not have the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, being geographically limited in some areas. Moreover, duration of previous experiences of school closures ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks, while the current COVID-19 pandemic is causing much longer school closures. For example, in Italy, children and adolescents will be away from schools for almost 6 months (3 months of school closure plus 3 months of usual summer vacation), with the vague possibility of summer camps, in our opinion actually with low probability to be allowed and implemented.",

            "text": "Therefore, findings based on geographically and temporally limited school closures may be poorly informative for a pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 and consequent temporally extended school closures. This is the case because risk perception of children and also of their parents (other factors that Brooks and colleagues found related to the respect of social isolation [1]) is clearly different in the two scenarios and therefore also adherence to social isolation is probably different [5]. In this perspective, one of the main conclusions of the review, i.e. during school closure children continue having social contacts with others, is very poorly informative to predict adherence to social isolation of children during school closure along the COVID-19 pandemic.",
