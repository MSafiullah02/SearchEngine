The diluted plasmids were mixed with 120 \u03bcg of PEI diluted in 1.5 mL of OPTI\u2010MEM for 20 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the plasmids and PEI mixture were added to HEK 293 T cells. After culture for 2 days, the transfectants were mixed with microbeads labeled with anti\u2010human CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb; Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and CD8+ cells isolated using autoMACS or MACS LS columns (Miltenyi), and then infected with HSV\u20101.

To determine whether the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system could be used to edit viral genomes, first an attempt was made to edit the gE gene by designing three unique 20 nt guide sequences followed by PAM sequences in the ORF of gE (Fig. 1a) and then cloning them into a plasmid\u2010expressing codon\u2010optimized S. pyogenes Cas9 (Cas9) and a chimeric sgRNA 17.These gE\u2010 or mock\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs were transfected into HEK 293 T cells along with a plasmid expressing human CD8 as a marker of transfection. When CD8 positive cells transfected with gE\u2010 or mock\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA were enriched and infected with HSV\u20101, high proportions of gE\u2010negative cells in HSV\u2010infected cells were observed in gE\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA transfectants but not in mock\u2010transfectants (Fig. 1b). The proportion of gE\u2010negative cells in HSV\u2010infected cells was quite low when cells transfected with gE\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA had not been enriched for CD8 positive cells. Therefore, enrichment of sgRNA/Cas9\u2010expressing cells by using cell surface marker increases efficiency of genome editing by sgRNA/Cas9.",

Wells containing Vero cells that were monoclonally infected with HSV\u20101 were identified by microscopy and the HSV\u20101 genome around the gE gene was amplified by PCR from the culture supernatants of the infected cells. Thereafter, each gE gene sequence was determined (Fig. 1a). Mutations in the gE gene were detected in HSV\u20101 clones obtained from the transfectants with all three gE\u2010targeting plasmids but not with mock plasmids (Fig. 1c). In particular, more than 60% of the clones contained the expected mutations in gE when targeting sequences #30 and #776 had been used. Cells infected with viruses possessing frameshift mutations did not express gE on their surfaces (Fig. 1d). On the other hand, cells infected with some HSV\u20101 clones carrying in\u2010frame mutations in gE, such as #6\u20103 and #30\u20104, still expressed gE on their surfaces (Fig. 1d,f). When expression of gE on cells infected with each HSV\u20101 clone was assessed by flow cytometry and the gE gene of each HSV\u20101 clone lacking gE expression on the cell surface sequenced, almost all clones were found to contain the expected gE mutations (Fig. 1e,f).",

ACV is phosphorylated by viral TK but not cellular TK, and phosphorylated ACV competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase for deoxyguanosine triphosphate, resulting in inhibition of viral replication 28, 29. TK\u2010disrupted viruses were also generated using the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system with the same procedure as that used to generate gE\u2010ablated viruses (Fig. 2a,b). Many ACV\u2010resistant HSV\u20101 mutants were obtained from cells transfected with TK\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs, whereas only one ACV\u2010resistant HSV\u20101 clone was obtained from cells transfected with mock\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs (Fig. 2c). Almost half of the clones obtained from cells transfected with TK\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs contained the expected mutations in the TK gene when construct #515, which targets Cas9/sgRNA, had been used. Some clones (#515\u20102 and \u20103) contained in\u2010frame deletions in the TK gene but were resistant to ACV. Because the region between amino acid residues 161 and 192 in TK is highly conserved among HSVs and is involved in nucleotide binding and homodimerization of TK, an in\u2010frame deletion in this region might have significantly affected the function of TK. Furthermore, all clones were found to contain mutations in the TK gene after ACV selection (Fig. 2d). In contrast, one ACV\u2010resistant HSV\u20101 clone obtained from cells transfected with mock\u2010targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs had a mutation in TK gene that is not related to the targeting site.",

A pair of Cas9/sgRNA constructs targeting the flanking region of the mutated sites, a ssODN bearing a wild\u2010type gE sequence as the repair template and a CD8\u2010expressing plasmid, were cotransfected into HEK 293T cells. Silent mutations were included in the repair ssODN sequence so that it would not be recognized by the Cas9/sgRNA constructs. Two days later, CD8 expressing cells were isolated and infected with gE\u2010mutant viruses (mutants #776\u20101,\u20102 and \u20109) (Fig. 1a,f). Production of gE\u2010revertant clones was evaluated by using flow cytometry to assess expression of gE on the cell surfaces as well as sequencing of the gE genes of each clone (Fig. 3a,b). Revertants expressing gE with silent mutations were detected but no clone possessing the wild\u2010type gE was identified (Fig. 3a). No revertant was obtained when the repair ssODN was transfected without a pair of targeting plasmids. Generation by revertant viruses was less efficient than that by viruses carrying simple gE mutations (Figs. 1c, e and 3c). Some viruses that failed to incorporate the repair ssODN had additional muations in gE that were generated by a pair of gE\u2010targeting plasmids. The gE gene sequences around the targeted sites of all five revertant clones generated with a pair of plasmids targeting gE (#745c) and gE (#793) along with ssODN were identical. Also, identical gE sequences were obtained from the two revertant clones generated with plasmids pair targeting gE (#754c) and gE (#793) and from all five clones with plasmids targeting gE (#760c) and gE (#793). The gE sequences outside the targeted sites remained identical with the parental sequence (Fig. 3a). HSV\u20101 genomic DNA deleted by the pair of Cas9/sgRNA is seemingly repaired more efficiently by ssODN than an undeleted parental genome DNA is.",

            "text": "In this study, we exploited the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system to edit a large 152 kb genome of HSV\u20101. Our procedure enabled us to generate HSV\u20101\u2010containing specific gene mutations at a high frequency in less than 2 weeks (Figs. 1c and 2b). More than 50% of the HSV\u20101 clones generated by this system had the expected mutations when appropriate target sequences had been used. Because of the high efficiency of HSV\u20101 genome editing by our Cas9/sgRNA system, we could obtain the specific mutants apparently without unexpected mutations. However, not all targeting plasmids were highly efficient at HSV\u20101 genome editing. Indeed, gene\u2010ablation efficiency was 33% and 5.8% when plasmids targeting gE #6 and TK #41, respectively, were used. Efficiency of editing viral genomes seems to be affected by the target sequence. Use of certain phenotypic changes induced by mutations enhances efficiency, as we have shown for mutations of gE or TK. Indeed, almost 100% of the viral clones had the expected mutations when the mutant viruses were phenotypically enriched by gE expression or ACV sensitivity. Therefore, generation of mutant HSV\u20101 using the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system is much more efficient than that using the conventional method, in which mutant viruses are generated by spontaneous homologous recombination in the presence of an extrinsically introduced gene. Although we did not edit essential genes that are involved in viral survival or infectivity, it may be possible to edit the essential genes by using HEK 293T cells and Vero cells transfected with the wild\u2010type gene of interest. Although undesired \u201coff\u2010target\u201d mutations have been of concern with the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system, off\u2010target mutations might be decreased by using a mutated Cas9 nuclease that does not cause double\u2010strand breaks but introduces a single\u2010strand nick 30. Use of mutant Cas9 might be useful for decreasing the off\u2010target effect in viral genome editing. Recently, engineering of genes of adenovirus and HSV\u20101 by the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system was reported 31. However, in the current study, we generated not only gene\u2010ablated virus but also revertant virus from the gene gene\u2010ablated virus, which is close to essential for studying specific viral genes. In addition, we assessed cells infected with mutant virus by flow cytometry to directly ascertain the effects of gene editing. Therefore, this study provides important information required for editing viral genes with the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system.",

In addition, this method will allow functional analysis of viral genes directly derived from the field or patients. Because we detected knock\u2010in viruses in approximately 10% of randomly chosen clones without the use of selection markers, this system is useful not only for introducing genetic ablation into viruses but also for generating knock\u2010in viruses. The CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system is reportedly useful for editing HIV genome integrated into host cell genome 32. However, these authors' technique differed from ours in that viral DNA genome was directly edited by the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system. Because HSV\u20101 mutants are candidates for clinical trials of oncolytic virotherapy, editing large viral genomes using the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system could contribute to generating mutant viruses suitable for therapeutic applications. In addition, this system can be further applied to other large DNA viruses belonging to the Herpesviridae, Poxviridae and Baculoviridae families, such as cytomegalovirus, varicella\u2010zoster virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and vaccinia virus. Furthermore, our technique will enable engineering of viruses for therapeutic usage such as viral vector and tumor lysis more readily than conventional methods.",
