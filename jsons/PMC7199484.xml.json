            "text": "Viral respiratory diseases are a major health problem and represent the leading cause of death due to infectious disease in Canada [1]. They affect people of all ages and exert a great economic impact on the health-care system. The viruses most frequently associated with respiratory-tract infections include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), adenoviruses, and the recently identified human metapneumovirus (hMPV). However, the etiological agents for a large number of respiratory infections remain unknown. A new human coronavirus, NL63 (HCoV-NL63), has been discovered in The Netherlands [2]. The virus was identified in clinical specimens from both infants and adults suffering from respiratory-tract illnesses [2]. Other HCoVs have been associated with respiratory illnesses. In certain populations, the most common HCoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, are responsible for up to 30% of the common-cold syndrome [3]. However, several studies have found that these viruses are associated with more-severe respiratory infections [4\u20137]. A novel coronavirus, HCoV-SARS, has been associated with severe atypical pneumonia and caused 774 deaths worldwide during November 2002-July 2003 [8]. Coronaviruses are divided into 3 serotypes, on the basis of both their host range and their genome sequence. Group 1 and 2 viruses are mammalian coronaviruses and include HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43, respectively, whereas group 3 consists of avian coronaviruses. HCoV-SARS does not closely resemble viruses in any of the 3 known groups of coronaviruses. Analyses of the complete genome sequence of HCoV-NL63 have revealed that the virus is a new group 1 coronavirus that is closely related to HCoV-229 [2]. The relative importance of HCoV-NL63 in viral respiratory-tract illnesses is still not known. In the present study, we retrospectively looked for the presence of HCoV-NL63 in Canadian patients suffering from acute respiratory-tract infection (ARI) during the winter months of 2001\u20132002, to assess the impact that HCoVNL63 infections have on ARI and to describe the presenting signs and symptoms of the ARI caused by this virus.",

Although, in a study like this one, the inclusion of a control group of healthy individuals is necessary to clearly demonstrate a causal relationship, the detection of HCoV-NL63 in respiratory-tract specimens from patients suffering from ARI of unknown causes strongly suggests that it is associated with respiratory illness. This finding supports the association, found by van der Hoek et al. [2], of HCoV-NL63 with ARI. It also demonstrates for the first time that HCoV-NL63 was present in several Canadian provinces during the 2002 winter season, suggesting that HCoV-NL63 may be circulating worldwide.We detected the presence of HCoV-NL63 in 19 (3.6%) of the 525 analyzed specimens that were negative for (1) influenza viruses A and B; (2) PIV 1, 2, and 3; (3) adenovirus; (4) RSV; and (5) hMPV; and these results provide further evidence of the contribution of HCoV-NL63 to ARI\u2014and of the significant burden that it therefore may present to health-care systems. For the time period that was analyzed in the present study, peak activity of HCoV-NL63 was found to occur during January\u2013March 2002. Although sampling occurred only during the winter season (October\u2013April), our results are consistent with van der Hoek et al.'s [2] finding that HCoV-NL63 appears to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season. Other HCoVs, as well as influenza and RSV, which are involved in a substantial number of hospitalizations for ARI, were also shown to be present in patients with ARI during that time of the year [7]. The clinical symptoms associated with HCoV-NL63 infection are also comparable to those observed to be associated with influenza, RSV, and other HCoVs, making it impossible, at least on the basis of seasonality and clinical manifestations, to differentiate between these viral infections. Previous estimates of the contributions of RSV and other etiological agents to ARI based on these parameters may have been biased because the involvement of other new respiratory viruses such as hMPV and HCoV-NL63 were overlooked [10]. Thus, the systematic detection of HCoV-NL63 in respiratory specimens may improve the understanding of the etiology of ARI; however, the possibility of dual infection cannot be excluded, because the present study utilized samples from patients with ARI who were tested\u2014and found to be negative\u2014for only (1) influenza viruses A and B; (2) PIV 1, 2, and 3; (3) adenovirus; (4) RSV; and (5) hMPV. Nor can it be ruled out that HCoV-NL63 can exist asymptomatically in an individual, because samples from healthy individuals were not included. In addition, the present study provides evidence that HCoV-NL63 may have been associated with an outbreak of ARI in a personal-care home. All hospitalizations occurred in the 0-5-year-old and <50-year-old age groups, which suggests that, like the other HCoVs and RSV, HCoV-NL63 may cause more-severe ARI in frail patients, such as infants and the elderly, than in other patients [4, 6, 11\u201313].",
