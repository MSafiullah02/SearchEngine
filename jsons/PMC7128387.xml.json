The study findings suggest that bats and camels jointly play an important part in the persistence and evolution of MERS-CoV, resulting in spillover to the human population.1, 2 Theoretical epidemiologists refer to such combinations of animal hosts as the reservoir community.3\n",

Second, in the absence of the reservoir community, transmission cannot be maintained (by definition), which is referred to as the sufficient condition.3, 4 If other animal hosts can also maintain transmission, the reservoir community will have to include these hosts. In view of these conditions, although the identification of antibodies in camels is remarkable, an explicit assessment of the epidemiological role of camels has yet to be made to elucidate the mechanism of emergence in human beings.",

Rather than doing a cross-sectional survey (to take a snapshot of prevalence), the identification of the reservoir host requires understanding of the incidence (ie, rate of new infections) to measure transmissibility. Serial cross-sectional surveys or large-scale follow-up of cohorts (of susceptible camels, not of those already infected) would be required. Alternatively, implementation of a transmission experiment with uninfected camels could also be useful, because the transmissibility of infected camels can be objectively quantified. Even a simple one-to-one transmission experiment could inform about the presence of substantial transmissibility.5\n",
