An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, R 0 , from the limited information available. We present a novel method that enables us to make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier stage compared to other available methods. Our method takes into account the possibility that a disease has a wide distribution of infectious period and that the degree distribution of the contact network is heterogeneous. We validate our analytical framework with numerical simulations.",

It is generally defined as the expected number of new infections caused by a typical individual during the whole period of his/her infection, in a totally susceptible population (Anderson & May, 1991; Anderson & Britton, 2000; Dietz, 1993) . Because R 0 is a simple scalar quantity, and perhaps because in many circumstances it determines the expected final size of an outbreak (Kermack & McKendrick, 1927; Dietz, 1993; Ma & Earn, 2006; Arino et al., 2007; Brauer, 2008) it has been widely used as a gold standard to gauge the degree of threat that a specific infectious agent will pose as an outbreak progresses (Hethcote, 2000; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Fraser et al., 2009) . While it is clear that knowing the value of R 0 can be very useful to policymakers who are responding to an infectious disease invasion, it is not straightforward to obtain a reliable estimate of R 0 , especially in early stages of an outbreak before large scale uncontrolled transmission has taken place and before the basic biology and transmission pathways of the pathogen have been characterized.",

            "text": "Early in an outbreak, the pattern of disease spread is predominantly under the influence of the probabilistic nature of infection transmission. Consequently, a wide array of ultimate outcomes is possible, ranging from the outbreak fizzling out even in the absence of intervention to circumstances where the initial stage expands into a large-scale epidemic. Once a full-blown epidemic develops, several assumptions can be made that simplify the estimation of R 0 , as has been discussed in detail in the literature (Anderson & May, 1991; Dietz, 1993; Hethcote, 2000; Ma & Earn, 2006) . In many circumstances, however, it is crucial to assess the impact of various intervention strategies before a large-scale epidemic occurs. In doing so, stochastic manifestations of disease transmission as well as the underlying structure of the contact network 2 should be taken into account. The first aspect has been widely studied during the past. For example, the Reed-Frost model is a particular case of a chain-binomial stochastic model, where each infected individual can infect susceptible individuals independently, and those individuals are assumed to have the same contact rate with one another (Abbey, 1952; Addy et al., 1991; Ball, 1986) . Another example is the methodology developed by Becker (Becker, 1976) and Ball and Donnelly (Ball & Donnelly, 1995) based on a branching process susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model. Branching processes have received wide attention because they facilitate the evaluation of the reproduction number as well as the final epidemic size and epidemic probability (Guttorp, 1991) . More recently, the 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) inspired the development of new methodologies based on knowledge of the daily number of new cases and the distribution of the serial interval between successive infections (Wallinga & Teunis, 2004; Cauchemez et al., 2006a,b) . Unfortunately, none of these methods take into consideration the underlying contact network behind the epidemic process.",

The main parameters used in this approach, i.e., the quantities we require in order to apply the method, are the infection rate probability, the removal rate probability and the number of newly-infected individuals per unit of time (case-notification data). The infection rate quantifies crucial information about the biology of the disease. For instance, for a viral infection, the infection rate, in principle, may be related to the viral load of infectious individuals. The removal rate indicates how quickly the infectious individuals are removed from disease dynamics. This rate can be related to death or various means of interven-3 tion such as quarantine, reduction of social activity due to severity of illness, behavior change, or other factors. The product of infection rate probability and the cumulative removal rate probability is related to the generation interval distribution (Wallinga & Lipsitch, 2007 ) (see section VI). The three main parameters will be discussed in more detail throughout the paper.",

We will show how knowledge of the social contact network can be utilized to obtain a more reliable estimate of the reproduction number. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the ideas of contact network epidemiology and define the concepts of infectious rate, recovery rate and transmissibility. In Section 3 we show some examples of the spread of an infectious agent on a contact network. In Section 4 we outline a general framework to estimate the reproductive number assuming that all information about a specific realization of the epidemic process up to time t is known. In Section 5 we derive several expressions that allow us to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 , at an early stage of an outbreak and show some examples of the methodology. Finally, in section 6 we show the relationship between our results and the methodology developed by Wallinga and Lipsitch (Wallinga & Lipsitch, 2007) , which is a special case of the framework presented in this paper.",

We map a collection of N individ-uals to a network in which each vertex represents an individual and each edge shows a pathway of possible infection transmission between two individuals. The degree of each individual, i.e., the number of contacts that s/he has -or the number of edges emanating from a vertex -is denoted by \u03ba, and p k denotes the degree distribution, i.e., the probability that a randomly chosen vertex has degree k (k contacts). Several important quantities can be derived once a network's degree distribution is known. All moments of the degree distribution can be obtained since k n = \u221e \u03ba=0 k \u03ba p \u03ba . For n = 1, k is the average number of nearest neighbors of a randomly chosen individual, which we denote z 1 . The average number of second degree neighbors of a randomly selected individual, z 2 , can be expressed as k 2 \u2212 k (Newman, 2002) . To estimate R 0 , we count the number of edges along which an individual can infect others, once that individual has become infected. This quantity, the excess degree, is the number of edges emanating from a vertex (individual), excluding the edge that was the source of the focal individual's infection. In fact, the average excess degree is simply the ratio z 2 z 1 (Noel et al., 2009) .",

While harboring the infection, the person is first exposed (i.e., infected but not infectious) and then infectious (either symptomatically or asymptomatically). The individual may also recover, by which we mean only that s/he can no longer transmit the infection, not that s/he has necessarily completely cleared the pathogen; for some diseases, after a temporary recovery, the person might become infectious again.

We provided the details of calculations and compared our results at each step against simulations. Case notification data (time series) is the main input to this analytical framework. As an outbreak begins to unfold, the pattern of spread depends substantially on the structure of the underlying contact network. This dependency, in fact, manifests itself in the formation of the time series of newly infected cases. The proposed methodology highlights the interplay between the heterogeneity in contacts (network structure), the estimates of the basic reproductive number and infection 24 transmissibility. Depending on the circumstances, this methodology can be used to infer other useful quantities as well. For infectious pathogens that cause repeated outbreaks, there is enough empirical evidence to establish the distribution of the duration of infectiousness as well as the recovery rate of individuals. In this case, in addition to the basic reproductive number, the proposed methodology can shed light on the structure of the underlying contact network by estimating the ratio z 2 z 1 . This is an important piece of information, because in many circumstances it is not possible to capture and build a detailed contact network among individuals based on some network generative rules. The importance of this quantity becomes more apparent when an emerging infectious disease strikes a population. In this circumstance, there is much less information on the characteristics of the disease such as the duration of infectiousness and recovery rate, which in turn determine the transmissibility of disease. Knowledge of the transmissibility of a disease during an early stage of an epidemic can play a crucial role, as effective and cost-effective public health intervention strategies hinge on the degree of contagiousness of a disease. On the other hand, before the spread of disease becomes rampant, the structure of the contact network within a population remains more or less stable. Therefore, the estimated value of z 2 z 1 obtained during epidemic lulls from the time series corresponding to common infections can be used to estimate the transmissibility of an emerging infectious disease at an early stage of an emerging infectious outbreak. We demonstrated this concept by two examples. Our estimate for the reproduction number very quickly tends to the real value, thus enabling epidemiologists and policymakers to identify the optimal control strategies in real time.",

The stochastic behavior is dominant in the initial state of disease spread when the number of infectious individuals is comparatively small (stochastic regime). The effect of stochasticity becomes much less relevant when the number of newly infected individuals dramatically increases, as in this case where the stochastic fluctuations (noise) are overwhelmed by a smooth \"signal\" (exponential regime).

We have used the following method (Newman, 2002; Noel et al., 2009) to produce a network related to given degree distribution: (i) Generate a random degree sequence k j of length N subjected to the degree distribution p k . (ii) Make sure that j k j is an even number since a link is composed of two \"stubs.\" (iii) For each j, produce a node with k j stubs. (iv) Randomly choose a pair of unconnected stubs and connect them together. Repeat until all unconnected stubs are exhausted. (v) Test for the presence of selfloops and repeated links. Remove the faulty stubs by randomly choosing a pair of connected stubs and rewire them to the former stubs. Repeat until no self-loops and/or repeated links are found.To simulate the spread of disease on a contact network in continuous time we follow a Tau-Leaping approach (Gillespie, 2001; Gillespie & Petzold, 2003; Higham, 2008) , which we describe below. The processes of disease transmission along one edge and the removal of infectious individuals are controlled by \u03bb i (\u03c4 ) and \u03bb r (\u03c4 ), respectively. We divide time into intervals of length \u2206t and ensure that \u03bb i (\u03c4 )\u2206t and \u03bb r (\u03c4 )\u2206t are small enough, such that the expected epidemic curve does not vary much by reducing \u2206t even further. At every \u2206t step, each infectious individuals recovers with probability \u03bb r (\u03c4 j )\u2206t, where \u03c4 j is the age of infection of individual j. If an infectious individual does not recover, then it infects independently each of its susceptible contacts with probability \u03bb i (\u03c4 j )\u2206t. ",
