            "text": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can cause significant and costly health and social problems [1\u20134]. In Australia (and internationally) communicable disease risks are monitored through three core public health activities: (i) outbreak investigations; (ii) disease surveillance; and, (iii) public health research [5]. They all rely on systematic data collection to direct health resources and initiate public health actions in response to communicable disease risks and outbreaks. Two new technologies - pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS; pathogenomics) and \u2018Big Data\u2019 analytics - could greatly enhance communicable disease control [6]. WGS is the ultimate microbiological strain-typing method. Effective communicable disease prevention and control depends on the accurate identification and characterisation of the causal pathogen - including the strain involved [7\u20139]. Increasingly sophisticated strain-typing methods have been developed over the past 20 years but, until recently, they have been expensive, time-consuming and/or poorly discriminatory. WGS systems that are faster, cheaper and more informative are being introduced into public health laboratories [10\u201313]. Their integration into infectious disease diagnosis and management will dramatically improve the accuracy and speed of pathogen identification and biological risk prediction. WGS produce universally understood data expressed in the sequence of nucleotides which can be used to reconstruct transmission pathways, highlight missing cases, and, potentially, locate an individual at the time of exposure [14\u201316]. Pathogen WGS is already being used in public health surveillance systems in Australia [17] and elsewhere [18\u201322]. Because infectious disease risks are universal, there are global calls for equitable sharing of WGS-based surveillance data to help distribute the benefits [23]. The increasing availability of pathogen sequence data will provide new resources for communicable disease research, control and surveillance at local, national and global scales [24, 25].",

Technological innovation that assists collection, collation and interpretation of health-related information could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of communicable disease surveillance and outbreak investigation [27\u201329]. Government service providers hold large administrative datasets, and masses of data are generated by everyday life, for example retail transactions and internet and mobile phone use. If pathogen WGS data were linked to administrative and other data \u2013 such as geospatial tracking in mobile phones (GPS) and social media use for example \u2013 and examined systematically through an automated system, this information could be mined to uncover epidemiological associations much faster than traditional approaches [30]. The algorithms that analyse surveillance data have evolved substantially over the last decade [31]; incorporating them and novel information sources into established systems should provide earlier warning, more accurate monitoring and less uncertainty during early stages of outbreaks [25, 29, 32].",

            "text": "Current systems in New South Wales (NSW), Australia (as in many other jurisdictions) collect selected communicable disease-related data without individual consent under the powers granted by the Public Health Act 2010 [33]. This is justified by the need to operationalise public health protection, but tempered by a requirement that data are used only for public health purposes and personal information is protected [34, 35]. The benefits of earlier outbreak detection and response are significant. More expedient and specific interventions can limit the health and socioeconomic impacts of infectious diseases, but surveillance has political, personal and ethical implications [36, 37]. Risks include the use of flawed methods (as illustrated by Google Flu Trends\u00ae, which proved to have poor reliability) [38\u201340]. A trade-off may be required between data accuracy and privacy. Outbreak prediction or modelling based on inadequate data can have devastating economic, health and social consequences, but collecting, holding and sharing personal health information is a threat to privacy, no matter how great the potential benefits [41]. For example, WGS pathogen \u201cfingerprinting\u201d linked to clinical, epidemiological and spatiotemporal data will reveal information normally regarded as private (e.g. where a person has been, who they were with and the type of activity involved) [42\u201344]. Digital epidemiology \u2013 population disease detection and monitoring using \u2018Big Data\u2019 \u2013 raises similar issues [45]. Currently in public health research, data are de-identified and so might be assumed to be anonymous. However, in the absence of strict security measures, reidentification may be possible; re-identification usually can be achieved using linked metadata and other data sources, and hacking remains an ever-present risk [46\u201348].",

Potential implications of human genome sequencing were outside of the scope of this study. Decisions, about what data should be collected and what action thresholds are used, are not just matters for experts [37]. To secure social licence, these systems must align with community values; this can be facilitated by structured public dialogue to develop ethically and legally defensible justification for their design and operation [6, 49]. In this paper, we report on four community juries convened to consider the acceptability and legitimacy of using new technologies to enhance public health research and communicable disease surveillance. Research suggests that while the public tacitly accepts public health surveillance, they are less consistently convinced of the benefits of the secondary use of data for medical research [50\u201354]. Our aim was to ascertain, by means of community juries, the conditions under which a well-informed citizenry would or would not accept integration of pathogen WGS and Big Data analytics into communicable disease control, and why.",

None of the juries came to a definitive position as to how an opt-out system should be implemented, but all agreed that this consent model was most appropriate.

In general, jurors wanted only summary data to be shared internationally. Any linked data must be de-identified, protected by practices used for other government-operated administrative datasets, in Australia, and not publicly accessible, to reduce the risk of re-identification and protect privacy. Because WGS-related information could lead to adverse social, legal and actuarial consequences for individuals, jurors foresaw a need for legislation to reassure and protect the public from its misuse, including heavy penalties to deter hacking or leaking of data or unauthorised use by commercial (e.g. insurance or news media) organisations.

Consequently, all four juries were split on whether it should be an \u201copt in\u201d or \u201copt out\u201d system.

However, variations in strength of support for different options, between juries, suggests that the addition of more detailed information, about practices and governance of data-linkage processes (Jury #2 onwards) and potential risks of Big Data analytics (Jury #3 onwards), softened support for option C in later juries. If we regard the first two juries as pilot studies, the verdicts of the last two indicate that the application of Big Data analytics to perpetually linked datasets for communicable disease surveillance is likely to be highly controversial \u2013 especially if people do not fully understand its purpose or what is entailed in the establishment of such a system. Remembering that the task of jurors was to respond to the question and the evidence presented, through reflection, discussion and debate, the reasons given by Juries #1 and #2 for not supporting option C were also raised and discussed by Juries #3 and #4, but given greater weight by the latter.",

In contrast, more participants in Juries #3 and #4 were concerned with the way in which data was stored, de-identified and protected. Differences in the socio-demographic characteristics of each deliberative group may explain this variation. But our impression during jury proceedings \u2013 which a review of the transcripts supports \u2013 was that exposure to detailed information and real examples demonstrating the current risks and limitations of data security arrangements, in Talk 4 (see reference [66] for details), appears to have made participants far less convinced that the potential public health benefits are worth the level of intrusion into how they conduct their day-to-day lives. Therefore, as deliberative groups, the final two juries were far more cautious about surrendering their privacy without clear evidence of effectiveness.",

By providing extensive information from a range of experts, and ensuring conditions for reasonable and extended debate, independent community juries elicit more considered judgements than other social research methods such as surveys or focus groups. The sample size is small, but this is necessary for high-quality deliberation. A possible limitation is that the evidence presented changed between Jury#1 and Jury#3 in response to participant feedback asking for more detailed evidence on the potential risks of technologically enhancing communicable disease surveillance systems. Because all four deliberative groups articulated similar positions and conditions for accepting system implementation, the new evidence changed the balance of the vote in the final verdict, and not the sets of reasons participants had for accepting or rejecting system implementation. A strength of this study was the quality and reputation of the experts who gave testimony, and the process by which they moderated one another\u2019s presentations until all experts could accept that all views presented could be argued from the evidence.",

Without clear mechanisms to establish and sustain the trustworthiness of a syndromic surveillance system, the broader public will be distrustful of its purposes and goals, even when the potential public health benefits are clear.",
