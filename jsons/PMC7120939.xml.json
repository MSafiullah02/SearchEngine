The infection was probably described by Hippocrates 2400 years ago when he wrote: \u201cThere is fever, chill, pain in the head, the underpart of the jaw is swollen: the patient swallows with difficulties his saliva. The patient cannot spit, he cannot tolerate to lie down, and if he stays in this position he chokes\u201d [1]. In 1791, the first clear description of acute epiglottitis was published, and the term \u201cepiglottitis\u201d was coined in 1830 [2]. Invention of the laryngoscope in the 1850s allowed direct visualization of the swollen epiglottis, and soon thereafter the mirror examination of the hypopharynx and larynx became widely practiced. In the early twentieth century, the term \u201cacute epiglottitis\u201d became part of standard medical terminology and the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disease became clear. The prognosis of the disease improved in some cases with tracheotomy, tracheostomy, or intubation. George Washington, the first president of the United States, died in 1799 of an acute infection that was probably epiglottitis [3]. A tracheotomy (a new procedure then) was proposed by one of his physicians but not performed. The major advance in treatment of epiglottitis occurred following the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century. The introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in 1985 dramatically decreased the incidence of epiglottitis, especially in the pediatric population. The vaccine was improved (conjugated vaccine) in 1987 and 1990 so that efficacy extended to children younger than 18 months.",

Patients with epiglottitis find breathing in the supine position difficult or impossible and prefer to sit, leaning forward with a hyperextended neck. The patient may cough although infrequently, to clear secretions in the hypopharynx. An epiglottic abscess may be present and this is a risk factor for requiring airway intervention [7]. The differential diagnosis of epiglottitis in adults includes other causes of acute sore throat and severe odynophagia. In epiglottitis, however, the sore throat is more severe than expected based on the findings of the oropharynx examination.",

When acute epiglottitis is suspected, arrangements to secure the airway should be made immediately. The help of a pediatric otolaryngologist or anesthesiologist is often necessary. Supplemental humidified oxygen should be given. In children who are not in any respiratory distress, clinical examination may be cautiously performed as long as airway rescue is readily available. The classic red epiglottis may be visualized by gently depressing the anterior tongue with a tongue depressor. Similarly, plain neck x-rays can be obtained in the non-acute setting as the patient can remain in the seated position. The lateral view will indicate thickening of the epiglottis, similarly the anterior view will evaluate for subglottic finding which may be associated with other diagnoses in the differential such as croup. All children suspected of having epiglottitis who are undergoing x-ray evaluation should be closely monitored and observed during the entire period while these films are obtained. In more severe cases, the child should be transported to the operating room where the airway can be secured, by controlled intubation or tracheotomy, and diagnostic endoscopy can be performed.",

Indirect laryngoscopy with mirror examination can usually be performed in adults to diagnose epiglottitis, although nasolaryngeal endoscopy with a flexible fiberoptic may be safer and more easily done. The diagnosis of epiglottitis is made by noting a swollen and red epiglottis, although in adults the primary site of swelling may be in other supraglottic structures. One study found swelling of the epiglottis in 73% of adults with epiglottitis but swelling of the epiglottis alone occurred in only 17% [8].",

Preparations for obtaining a surgical airway, such as tracheotomy, should always coincide with any attempt at intubation, as acute airway obstruction can occur with a failed intubation attempt as discussed later. Awake fiberoptic intubation can be attempted in the cooperative patient as an initial attempt to secure the airway. Direct and video-assisted laryngoscopy may be attempted, but the necessary sedation requires rapid access to airway and associated swelling and secretions can limit visualization. If an emergency surgical airway is required, the type depends on the age of the patient. Needle cricothyrotomy can be performed on patients of any age, but this is the preferred surgical technique in children under age 12. Needle cricothyrotomy is easier to perform and less likely to damage the larynx in young children than surgical cricothyrotomy. Needle cricothyrotomy provides stabilization of the patient allowing a formal surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or tracheotomy to be performed in a controlled manner. Should immediate airway access be required, then emergent cricothyrotomy such be undertaken, with potential conversion to a standard tracheotomy if warranted.",

Intravenous corticosteroids are often used in an effort to reduce supraglottic inflammation, although randomized controlled trials have not been performed to assess benefit. For adults with moderate to severe respiratory distress, more active intervention is necessary. Tracheotomy is not the first choice but should be chosen if expertise in difficult intubations is limited. Endotracheal intubation should be attempted only by an experienced anesthesiologist (or otolaryngologist) and always with readiness for immediate cricothyroidotomy. A failed endotracheal intubation attempt can result in immediate and total airway distress. There is no time to waste in providing an artificial airway in these cases. In cases with severe airway distress, awake tracheotomy with local anesthesia is the most secure and safe way to provide an airway.

Respiratory distress occurs in varying degrees, depending on the severity of the airway obstruction. In mild cases of croup, stridor is absent at rest but may be present when the child is upset or crying.

Epiglottitis, which used to be prevalent in children under age 5, is now seen more often in adults than in children. This decline in childhood epiglottitis is due to the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine . Streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, are now important causes of epiglottitis. Croup is a viral infection, usually due to parainfluenza virus, that primarily affects children ages 6 months to 3 years old. Epiglottitis and croup can cause sudden and life-threatening loss of the airway, and misdiagnosis or mismanagement can result in fatalities. With appropriate management, however, death from these infections is very rare.",
