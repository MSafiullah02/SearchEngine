A similar clinical syndrome was initially described in Germany in 1990 and spread to other countries in Europe over the next few years. Despite several reports describing a number of different agents as the cause of this disease, the causative agent remained unknown leading to the name \u201cmystery swine disease\u201d in the U.S. and either \u201cporcine epidemic abortion and respiratory syndrome\u201d or \u201cblue-ear pig disease\u201d in Europe. The latter name refers to the cyanosis or blue-reddish coloration of ears of pigs with this disease. Once the etiology of this \u201cmystery\u201d disease was established the name swine infertility and respiratory syndrome (SIRS) was suggested by North American investigators while the Europeans preferred porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). The latter name is now the accepted name for the syndrome.",

A similar virus (VR-2332) was isolated in the U.S. at the same time (Collins et al., 1992, Benfield et al., 1992) and one-year later in Canada (Dea et al., 1992). Comparison of the sequence of the Lelystad virus, now termed type 1 PRRSV, and North American, or type 2, virus isolates indicated that these viruses shared properties similar to the family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus, that includes lactate-dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDH), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (Benfield et al., 1992, Dea et al., 1992, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Balasuriya and MacLachlan, 2004).",

Strains with mutations in the nuclear localization signal of the N protein produce lower levels of viremia, a shorter duration of viremia in pigs, higher levels of neutralizing antibodies and reduced viral persistence in tonsils of pigs compared to pigs given the wild-type virus (Lee et al., 2006, Pei et al., 2008). Experiments using reverse genetics indicate that virulence is probably multigenic involving nsp3\u20138 proteins and GP5 (Kwon et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2008). These latter studies indicated that certain PRRSV chimeras produce attenuated clinical signs in either a respiratory (Wang et al., 2008) or pregnant sow model (Kwon et al., 2008). Finally, the highly virulent strain of PRRSV responsible for the outbreak in China in 2006 contains a unique 30-amino acid deletion in the nsp2 coding region that was presumed to be responsible for the increased virulence of these PRRSV strains. However, a recent study by Zhou et al. (2009) indicates that the nsp2 deletion is not associated with virulence of the high fever disease isolates. As reported in this issue, deletions in nsp2 can attenuate replication and virulence (Faaberg et al., this issue).",

PRRSV strains are now divided into two genotypes, European genotype (Type 1) and North-American (Type 2), both genotypes circulate globally (Kimman et al., 2009, Zimmerman et al., 2006). Strains within each genotype also vary considerably with sequence differences as high as 20% (Han et al., 2007, Meng, 2000, Nielson et al., 1999). The most variable structural protein is GP5 with 50\u201355% amino acid homology between North American and European isolates (Mardassi et al., 1996, Meng et al., 1995, Nielson et al., 1999). In this issue Shi et al.

Variability within GP5 may explain the inefficiency of current vaccines to cross-protect against all strains of PRRSV.

PRRSV infection is characterized by a delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies (often not appearing for 3\u20134 months post-infection) and a slow development of virus specific interferon responses. PRRSV is able to downregulate the production of inflammatory cytokines such as type 1 interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2), TNF-\u03b1, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Van Reeth et al., 1999, Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001).

Shortly after infection, most antibodies are non-neutralizing and are principally targeted to N and nsp2 proteins. Neutralizing antibodies appear as early as 2\u20134 weeks after infection but usually do not peak until several weeks to months later (Lopez and Osorio, 2004). The role of neutralizing antibodies has been debated principally because viremia persists in the host in the presence of neutralizing activity. The postulated role of antibody evasion strategies, such as immunodominant \u201cdecoy\u201d epitopes that produce non-protective immune responses and \u201cglycan shielding\u201d have been recently reviewed and discussed (Kimman et al., 2009).

Overall, the abundance of T-cells in either acute or persistent infection is highly variable and does not correlate with the level of virus replication in lymphoid tissues (Xiao et al., 2004). Additional studies have shown that the number of PRRSV specific IFN-\u03b3 producing T-cells following infection are low in PRRSV infected pigs compared to pigs vaccinated with a pseudorabies vaccine (Meir et al., 2003). In summary, T-cell responses to PRRSV are generally classified as weak, transient and highly variable. One lingering question is whether there are conserved T-cell epitopes that may provide cross-protection against PRRSV strains (Kimman et al., 2009).",

Three general questions were posed to the colloquium participants: (1) what is the efficacy of current PRRS vaccines; (2) what knowledge gaps need to be filled to improve the efficiency of current vaccines and to develop more efficacious PRRS vaccines; and (3) what is the probability that a successful PRRS vaccine can be developed. As to the efficacy it is clear that modified-live PRRS vaccines offer protection against reinfection with homologous and in some cases heterologous viruses. Killed-virus vaccines were viewed as ineffective or of limited efficacy at best against homologous protection. The key question is how to deal with the heterogeneity of PRRSV field isolates and provide cross-protection among heterologous strains of virus. The concept of \u201cheterologous\u201d in terms of PRRSV vaccines remains undefined. Properties of an improved vaccine should include rapid induction of immunity (innate immunity), no adverse outcomes to swine health and the ability to differentiate vaccinated from infected animals (DIVA vaccine) (deLima et al., 2008, Fang et al., 2008). Considerations for the development of vaccines, adjuvants (Charerntantanakul, 2009), and novel designs are reviewed and discussed in this issue by Thanawongnuwech and Suradhat (this issue), Huang and Meng (this issue) and Cruz et al.

Experimental evidence indicates that PRRSV is eventually eliminated from the host and persistent infection rarely last more than 200 days (Murtaugh, 2009). Veterinarians have used this information to develop the concept of \u201cherd closure\u201d as a means to eliminate PRRSV from herds. In herd closure all animals are exposed to PRRSV by vaccination or inoculation with virulent virus and then the herd is closed to all animal entry for 200 days. When na\u00efve gilts are introduced into these herds they remain negative. If there are re-breaks, it is almost always with a virus of a different genotype thus indicating a new outbreak (Murtaugh, 2009). This protocol is being used in \u201cregional elimination programs\u201d throughout the U.S. in an effort to eliminate PRRSV from less dense swine areas. The combination of vaccines, herd closure, biosecurity protocols and filtration units on swine housing to prevent area spread may well become the protocol for elimination of this virus in regional areas, as reviewed in this issue by Morrison et al. (this issue).",
