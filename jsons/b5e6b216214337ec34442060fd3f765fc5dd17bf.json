In comparative analysis of fecal examination results, the change of fecal property with accordance to diarrhea was confirmed in the COVID-19 group (all P < .001). The erythrocyte, leukocyte and occult blood (OB) in feces can be used as indirect predictors for gastrointestinal damage.

The risk for abnormal fecal examination (erythrocyte, leukocyte and/or OB) results in non-critical COVID-19 may be similar to baseline status of others lung diseases, but the risk in critical COVID-19 increased obviously. The appearance of erythrocyte, leukocyte and OB in feces represented the gastrointestinal damage, and indicated the increased risk of death in case of the exclusion of underlying diseases in gastrointestinal tract. It is known that gastrointestinal ulcer and bleeding is common in critical patients, especially in those with respiratory failure [6, 7] . High possibility of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in critical COVID-19 cases can increase the risk of secondary damage in gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the occurrence of abnormal fecal examination. Meanwhile, the occurrence of gastrointestinal damage can prompt gastrointestinal dysfunction which accelerate the process from MODS to death.",
