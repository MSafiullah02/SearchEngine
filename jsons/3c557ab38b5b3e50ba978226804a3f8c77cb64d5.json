            "text": "Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a causal agent of acute respiratory infection, especially in primarily children. At the clinical level, HMPV is associated to several diseases including bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbations, specifically in children less than 5 years. Here, we carried out a retrospective pilot study, based on the processing of nasopharyngeal swabs, with a focus on the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of HMPV in Senegal. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2016. Briefly, all outpatients presenting to healthcare sentinel sites were screened for surveillance enrollment and included if they met criteria for ILI. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible participants. For viral respiratory pathogens detection, including HMPV, the Anyplex\u2122 II RV16 Detection kit was used. A fragment of the hMPV F gene was targeted for sequencing. Results: In total, 8209 patients with ILI were enrolled. Half of them (49.7%) were children under 5 years. Fever was the most common symptom followed by cough, and rhinitis. Three hundred eight patients were positive for HMPV (3.75%). 89 (28.9%) were detected as single infection. In co-infection cases, the most common co-infecting viruses were influenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus. HMPV detection rates in the different age groups varied significantly with the children under 5 years group accounting for 71.7% of positive patients. The temporal distribution pattern for HMPV infection showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher activity during the rainy period (July-September). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HMPV specimens circulating in Senegal were distributed into the two main genetic lineages, A and B. We also noted a co-circulation of both genetic lineages during the whole study period except in 2014. Conclusion: In summary, the present study characterized the recent prevalence, seasonality and genetic diversity of HMPV in a large outpatient population presented with ILI in Senegal between 2012 and 2016. Globally our results show a clear seasonal circulation pattern of HMPV in Senegal. Our findings identified children less than 5 years as more susceptible group to HMPV infection. Molecular studies identified A2, B1 and B2 as the major genotypes circulating.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was first observed in isolates of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples collected from children with lower respiratory tract infection during the 1990s in Netherlands [1] . It is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, and the first member of the new Metapneumovirus genus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that infects humans [2] . HMPV is a causal agent of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in primarily children [3] . The virus causes substantial morbidity especially in the extremes of age and in the immunocompromised [4] . For instance, in hospitalized patients younger than 5 years of age, 5-7% of acute respiratory infections worldwide can be attributed to hMPV [5] . At the clinical level, hMPV is associated to several diseases including bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbations, specifically in children less than 5 years of age [6] . Despite the growing burden of diseases imputed to this pathogen, there is no specific prophylactic vaccination strategy in place although various vaccine candidates are currently under investigation [7] . In addition, little is known about the epidemiology of this virus, especially in low income countries due to the low availability of molecular diagnostic tools.",

Senegal, a country with around 16 Million people and situated in the western part of Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahel, had a National Influenza Center since 1974. The NIC is hosted at the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IPD) and had been part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance Network since 1996 [8] . The purpose of this influenza surveillance has traditionally been the early detection of influenza epidemics in the community, the identification of predominant circulating influenza strain, and the issuing of public health recommendations. In 2012, the network has been consequently enhanced with epidemiological data collection, additional sentinel sites, and virological surveillance extended to other respiratory viruses diagnosis [9] .",

ILI was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition: sudden onset of fever (\u226538\u00b0C) with cough or sore throat fewer than 3 days in duration. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible participants, placed in universal viral transport medium (Becton Dickinson and company, Italy), stored at 4-8\u00b0C, and then transported to the NIC within the following 72 h for the testing. In addition, demographic and clinical data were collected from each patient. Once in the laboratory, specimens were processed immediately for virus detection, identification, and characterization. Aliquots of each sample were also stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C for biobanking or additional analysis. Viral RNA from HMPV-positive samples was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Lithuania). A fragment of the hMPV F gene was targeted and amplified by nested PCR. The first amplification targeting a 750 bp fragment long was carried out using primers previously described [10] . The Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich MA, USA) was used for amplifications. For each sample, PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl consisting of 15 \u03bcl H2O RNase free, 2.5 \u03bcl of each primer (diluted at 10 \u03bcM), 25 \u03bcl of 2X Phusion Master Mix and 5 \u03bcl of cDNA template under the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation step of 15 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 35 PCR cycles including 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 60 s at 55\u00b0C, 60 s at 72\u00b0C, and a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. For the nested PCR, which targets 610 bp, internal primers hMPVF2F (5 ' ACATGCCAACATCTGCAGGACAAATAAAAC-3') and hMPVF2R (5\u2032-ACATGCTGT TCACCTTCAACTTTGC-3 '), and 1 \u03bcl of the first PCR product were used.",

The non detection of HMPV in this age group would be probably due to the low number of patients (3.5% of overall patients) from this group as a previous study exclusively focused on the elderly revealed a HMPV detection rate of 3.3% [9] . In our study, the majority (71.8%; 221/308) of HMPV-positive patients were children between 0 to 5 years old, with more than the half of them under 1 year age (55.7%, 123/221). Consistent with our findings, several studies have reported this sensitivity of children under 5, especially in the first year life, to HMPV infection [22] [23] [24] . This highest prevalence in children is believed to be due to a naive immune system for most of HMPV genotypes in early childhood. The bias in the composition of our study population (nearly 50% of children under 5) is another factor that would have accentuated the trend noted. No influence of the patients' gender on HMPV infection was observed in our study, which is consistent with the results of a study in China [25] . However, sex discrimination had been previously reported [26, 27] . Our findings regarding Influenza, HAdV and HRV as the most frequently co-detected viruses with HMPV were similar to those of Kong et al. [25] . Fever, cough, myalgia, and headache were the predominant clinical features associated with HMPV detection, which is in line with results from a study conducted in China [28] .",

The low sensitivity of conventional PCR compared with real time PCR on samples with low viral load, and certainly non-specific amplifications could be the cause of these failures. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated co-circulation of mainly three HMPV subgroups A2, B1 and B2. A similar genotypic composition has been observed in several other studies [13, 32, 33] . And as in other studies conducted in Saudi Arabia [26] , in Croatia [34] , in Panama [24] or in Kenya [32] , we have no strain belonging to genotype A1, supporting the idea that old lineages have been replaced by emerging genetic strains. Indeed, the A2c subgroup was present in Senegal throughout the study period, except in 2014 where it was not detected probably due to a non-exhaustive sequencing. The A2c genotype was the dominant circulating genotype in 2012-2013 periods, and then B1 in year 2014 where all the sequences obtained belonged exclusively to genotype B. However, in 2015 we observed a co-circulation of 4 genotypes with a predominance of subgroup B2 while A2c subgroup dominated in 2016. These results, despite the small number of sequenced strains, confirm previous observations on the changes and predominance of circulating HMPV genotypes [35] .",

So the sequencing results do not reflect the full spectrum of HMPV genotypes that may circulate in ILI patients in Senegal, and even for selected samples it may have a bias toward samples with a high viral load. Also it would be interesting to analyze G gene region coding for attachment proteins for more acuity on the genetic variability of circulating strains. Secondly, in our study only outdoor patients were recruited. Thus further studies including both outpatients and inpatients (hospitalized) would be required to firmly establish the burden associated with HMPV in Senegal and correlations between disease severity and genotypes.",

Globally our results showed a clear seasonal pattern of HMPV in the second half of each year, between June and October with a possibly extending into November. Our findings also identified children less than 5 years old as being more susceptible to HMPV infection. Molecular studies identified A2, B1 and B2 as the major genotypes circulating. However, additional sequencing work targeting both G and F genes should be carried out in order to enhance understanding of the local and global molecular epidemiology of HMPV strains from Senegal. The next step will be the the HMPV burden assessment in Senegal, especially in pediatric hospitalized cases. Data on disease outcome, atypical clinical signs, viral load, shedding, duration of symptoms, duration of hospitalization and treatment will be collected and included in analyses. ",
