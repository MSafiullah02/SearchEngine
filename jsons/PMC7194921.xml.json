The first two-thirds of the viral 30 kb RNA genome, mainly named as ORF1a/b region, translates into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and encodes most of the non-structural proteins (nsp). The rest parts of the virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein2, 3, 4. Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus (CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL), and papain-like (PLP) proteases5\n,\n6. Because mutant viruses in the S protein are prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with different host-cell receptor binding patterns6, there are limitations on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches. Antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "In order to obtain the atomic information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, we solved the structure at 2.7 \u00c5 resolution using X-ray crystallography technology. Briefly, 47\u2013173 residues of SARS-CoV-2 N protein were constructed, expressed, and purified as described protocol (Section 2. Materials and methods). The structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined by molecular replacement using the SARS-CoV N-NTD structure (PDB:2OG3) as the search model25. The final structure was refined to R-factor and R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively. The complete statistics for data collection, phasing and refinement are presented in Table 1. Unlike to SARS-CoV N-NTD crystals packing modes (monoclinic form at 2OFZ, cubic form at 2OG3)25, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD crystal shows orthorhombic crystal packing form with four N-NTD monomers in one asymmetry unit (Fig. 2\nA). In a previous study, Saikatendu et al.25 found that SARS-CoV N-NTD had two different packing modes in distinct crystal forms. The symmetry molecules in the monoclinic crystal form pack in a head-to-head linear 3D array, with most of the interfacial interactions being made by residues of the positively charged \u03b2-hairpin (Supporting Information Fig. S3A). In the cubic crystal form, the SARS-CoV N-NTD packs in a helical tubules array (Fig. S3B). In our study, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD packs into orthorhombic crystal form, where the interfacial interactions are formed by residues of \u03b2-hairpin fingers and palm regions (Fig. S3C). Although evidence for real RNP organization in the mature virions is lacking, the differences in the crystal packing patterns may implicate other potential contacts in SARS-CoV-2 RNP formation process. All four monomers in one asymmetric unit of the SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD crystal structure shared similar right-handed (loops)-(\u03b2-sheet core)-(loops) sandwiched fold, as conserved among the CoVs N-NTD (Fig. 2B). The \u03b2-sheet core consists of five antiparallel \u03b2-strands with a single short 310 helix just before strand \u03b22, and a protruding \u03b2-hairpin between strands \u03b22 and \u03b25. The \u03b2-hairpin is functionally essential for CoV N-NTD, implicated in mutational analysis of amino acid residues for RNA binding30 (Fig. 2C). The SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, folding into a right-hand shape, which resembles with a protruded basic finger, a basic palm, and an acidic wrist (Fig. 2D).",

The most conserved residues distribute on the basic palm region (Fig. 3A, blue and green area), while the less conserved residues locate in basic fingers and acidic wrist regions (Fig. 3A, pink and red area). The available CoVs N-NTD crystal structures allowed us to compare the electrostatic potential on the surface. As shown in Fig. 3B, although CoV N-NTDs all adapt similar overall organizations, the surface charge distribution patterns are different. Consistently with our observations, the previous modeling of related coronaviral N-NTDs also showed markedly differ in surface charge distributions25. The superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with three kinds of CoVs N-NTD is shown in Fig. 3C. Compared with SARS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD shows a 2.1 \u00c5 movement in the \u03b2-hairpin region forward to nucleotide binding site (Fig. 3C, left panel). While compared with MERS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD shows a less extended \u03b2-hairpin region, and a distinct relax N-terminal tail (Fig. 3C, middle panel). Inconsistently, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD shows a distinct loosen N-terminal tail, and a 2 \u00c5 movement in the \u03b2-hairpin region backward to the opposite side of nucleotide binding site when the structure is compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Fig. 3C, right panel). These differences dramatically change the surface characterizations of the protein, which may result in the RNA-binding cleft being adaptive to its RNA genome.",

Since the surface characterizations of N-NTD between SARS-CoV-2 with HCoV-OC43 are distinct, we next explored the differences of RNA binding mechanistic basis with superimposition analysis. Previous studies have shown that HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contained adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/uridine monophosphate (UMP)/cytosine monophosphate (CMP)/guanosine monophosphate (GMP) binding site alongside the middle two \u03b2-strands of its \u03b2-sheets core41. In the complex structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with ribonucleotides, the phosphate group was bound by Arg122 and Gly68 via ionic interactions, the pentose sugar ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl group was recognized by Ser64 and Arg164, the nitrogenous base was inserted into a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Phe57, Pro61, Tyr63, Tyr102, Tyr124, and Tyr126, mainly interacted with Tyr124 via \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking forces (Supporting Information Fig. S4). It is proposed that this ribonucleotide binding mechanism is essential for all coronavirus N proteins, applying to develop CoV N-NTD-target agents.",

            "text": "To obtain the structure information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD ribonucleotide binding site, we made a superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD-AMP complex. As expected, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between these two structure coordinates is 1.4 \u00c5 over 136 superimposed C\u03b1 atoms. However, several differences around the ribonucleotide binding site were shown as the superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD. The major difference is the N-terminal tail of N-NTD with sequence variation (SARS-CoV-2: 48 NNTA 51 versus HCoV-OC43: 60 VPYY 63). In HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, the tail folded up to compose a nitrogenous base binding channel, whereas this region extended outward in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4\nA). The N-terminal tail movement contributed to the change of N-NTD surface charge distribution, at which the nucleotide binding cavity became easier to access in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD (Fig. 4B and C). The second difference is on phosphate group binding site, where SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD has larger sidechain residues (55 TA 56) compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD equivalents (67 SG 68) (Fig. 4D). Structural superimposition suggested additional polar properties of Thr55 and Ala56 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD may increase the steric clash with ribonucleotide phosphate moiety (Fig. 4E and F). The third difference is on the edge of the nitrogenous base recognized hydrophobic pocket, where SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD had Arg89 residues compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Tyr102 equivalents (Fig. 4G). The change of these residue sidechain may lead to dramatic decreasing of non-polar properties and increasing of polar features in the nitrogenous base binding site (Fig. 4H and I). To evaluate these different observations in our structure, we next performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis experiments to assess the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with all four kinds of ribonucleotide AMP/UMP/CMP/GMP. Intriguingly, all 5\u2032-monophosphate ribonucleotides, excepted for GMP (K\nD value is 8 mmol/L), show little binding signals in assays (Supporting Information Fig. S5). Similar results were shown in the Bio-Layer Interferometry (Octet RED96e, Fortebio) interaction analysis for SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with all four kinds of ribonucleotide AMP/UMP/CMP/GMP (Supporting Information Fig. S6). To elucidate the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with RNA, we next used SPR to determine the dissociation constants. A viral RNA derived intergenic sequence, 5\u2032-(AAGUUCGUUU)-3\u2032, was used in the SPR experiments. As shown in Supporting Information Fig. S7, the dissociation constants (K\nD) for RNA binding to wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD is 140 \u03bcmol/L, around 2000-fold smaller than the value of Y110A mutant (K\nD = 330 mmol/L). This implies that WT SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD has a higher binding affinity to viral derived RNA than mutant in the binding pocket. Altogether, the above results suggest potential distinct ribonucleotide-binding patterns between SARS-CoV-2 N protein with HCoV-OC43 N protein.",

The N-terminal tail residues (Asn48, Asn49, Thr50, and Ala51) is found to be more flexible and extended outward compared with equivalent residues in HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, possibly opening up the binding pocket into fitting with viral RNA genomic high order structure. Residues Arg89, instead of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Tyr102, may contribute to guanosine base recognition despite the overall ribonucleotide binding that may be excluded by residues Thr55 and Ala56 in the phosphate moiety recognition site. In a previous study in which crystal structures of the CoV N-NTD in complex with five ligands (AMP, CMP, GMP, UMP, and inhibitor PJ34, respectively) were reported, Lin et al.41 demonstrated several general features for developing the hCoV-OC43 N-NTD targeting agents. The first feature is a polycyclic aromatic core (nitrogenous base in ribonucleotides), which is required to enable \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking with the Tyr102 residues. The second feature is hydrogen-bond-forming moieties to the aromatic core mediates specific interactions with the N-NTD (nitrogenous base in ribonucleotides). Third, attaching a branching moiety (or moieties) that fits the ribonucleotide-binding pocket can enhance the drug affinity and specificity. In our SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD structure, the observed differences affect the above features in the pocket. For example, the Arg89 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD will decrease the hydrogen-bond-forming moieties to the aromatic core (this effect may be weakened for guanosine base recognition as the arginine\u2013guanosine interactions are the most abundant contacts found in the amino acid-nucleotide interactions). Additionally, the branching phosphate group binding site in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD structure is different from hCoV-OC43 N-NTD one, at which Thr55 and Ala56 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD may increase the steric clash with ribonucleotide phosphate moiety. Therefore, the above results suggest that the introduction of a hydrogen-bond-forming moiety (a guanosine base like moiety) at the base recognition site and avoiding the steric clash at the branching phosphate group binding site would benefit the high-affinity ligand development.",
