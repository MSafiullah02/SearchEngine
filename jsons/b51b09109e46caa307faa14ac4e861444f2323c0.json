Clinic leaders reported accessing information about innovations mainly from government agencies, professional associations, peer organizations, and research literature. Leaders mentioned an average of two external sources of information. There was evidence of variation in how leaders accessed information and how information about innovations was communicated within clinics. Findings have implications for improving dissemination of information about innovations in mental health systems.",

In their Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment framework Aarons et al. (2011) note that the Exploration and Adoption stage begins when a potential adopter seeks out, acquires, or is otherwise exposed to an innovation. A theoretical framework of adoption by Wisdom et al. (2014) divides adoption into two phases: (1) pre-adoption, during which organizational staff gain awareness of an innovation and access relevant information with which to make an adoption decision, and (2) established adoption, during which organizational leaders weigh the risks and benefits of adoption and decide whether to commit to the innovation. This paper focuses on the pre-adoption phase, during which organizational staff gain awareness of an innovation and access relevant information with which to make an adoption decision (Mendel et al. 2008; Wisdom et al. 2014) . The activities and tasks in the pre-adoption phase set the tone for successful adoption and implementation, yet there are relatively few empirical studies directly examining them (Bradley et al. 2004; Chor et al. 2015; Fixsen et al. 2005; Panzano and Roth 2006; Powell et al. 2019; Proctor et al. 2011) .",

Beyond adoption, acquisition and use of information about innovations is associated with implementation and sustainment (Palinkas et al. 2017) .

However, social networks may have greater influence on the overall success of adoption (Greenhalgh et al. 2004; Mendel et al. 2008; Wisdom et al. 2014) . Social networks facilitate adoption by creating access to information and support, and by offering opportunities for collaboration around adoption (Palinkas et al. 2011 (Palinkas et al. , 2017 Valente et al. 2007; Valente and Davis 1999) . Organizations may adopt innovations in response to external sources in their networks, such as other community-based organizations or state and county colleagues Palinkas et al. 2015b) . Additional potential outside sources of information include university researchers, program developers, consultants, conferences, or professional associations, although some literature suggests that these sources may be relied upon less often .",

Further, leaders reported accessing only two different external sources on average. These findings offer preliminary evidence to suggest that disseminating information about innovations through oversight agencies may offer the greatest return on investment in terms of reaching the largest number of clinics. Study results also suggest that oversight agencies and technical assistance centers aiming to increase adoption should work to develop collaborative relationships with clinic leaders and support them in developing new networks and partnerships. However, the configuration of each service system will dictate which oversight agency is most salient (i.e. state, county, or city), and further research is needed to determine if these findings generalize to other service systems.
