Indeed, the first systematic concept analysis of \u201cchildren with complex care needs\u201d [2] was conducted based on Rodger\u2019s evolutionary method. As data sources, Brenner et al. [2] used PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. They reviewed 140 articles and found that CCHC refer to multi-faceted health and social care needs, often with a medical diagnosis or, at times, without a formal diagnosis. They concluded that the concept of \u201cchildren with complex care needs\u201d implies that children\u2019s needs follow a chronic and dynamic nature, across settings whilst being influenced by family and healthcare systems. In contrast to Brenner et al. [2], our concept analysis is focused on \u201cchildren with complex health conditions\u201d and takes a comprehensive approach using Walker and Avant (2011)\u2018s method [3]. The latter is a different approach, which includes broader data sources, namely both the literature on CCHC and information from interviews with key stakeholders on the meaning of this concept.",

According to this definition, \u201cchildren and youth with special health care needs (CSHCN)\u201d involve pediatric patients who either have or are at increased risk for chronic physical, developmental, emotional or behavioural conditions and who also need physical health care and other services (e.g., education, mental health and/or social services) of either a type or an extent beyond that required by the general population of children [4]. Using this definition, it was found that one in five U.S. families has a child or youth with a special health care need [4]. Some of these children may have severe care needs whilst others may show special health care needs without receiving any medical diagnosis. The age range of CCHC varies, generally including children from 0 to 18 or 19 years of age.",

[7] performed a PubMed and a Web of Science search, in addition to a hand search, and found 64 English and Dutch articles on pediatric chronic health conditions. These articles needed to report a conceptual definition and/or an operationalization of children\u2019s (aged 0\u201318) chronic health conditions. Van der Lee et al. found a range of different definitions of \u201cchronic health conditions\u201d, yielding a wide variability in their prevalence rates (0.22\u201344%). Only four of these identified definitions of \u201cchronic health conditions\u201d were cited commonly in the articles. Of note, the authors concluded that there was a need for an international consensus on a definition [7]. Brenner et al.\u2019s (2018) concept analysis was a significant step toward the full establishment of such a definition [2]. Building on these two key papers, our concept analysis applied the rigorous process of Walker and Avant\u2019s method [3] to further clarify the concept of CCHC. This paper contributed to the literature by (1) confirming existing definitions and (2) building on/extending the latter with a new proposed iteration.",

In studies [19\u201322] that drew on Feudtner et al. [12, 23], CCCs were conditions that may be expected to last at least 12 months, unless death occurs before, and to involve different organ systems or one organ system severely enough to require speciality care or hospitalizations. In a theoretical paper [13] and in empirical studies [14, 17], the authors focused on children with \u201clife-threatening\u201d [17] and \u201clife-limiting\u201d conditions [14], forming a sub-sample of CCHC, namely those with medical complexities and in palliative care. A doctoral dissertation on palliative care used terminal and life-threatening illnesses interchangeably [15]. Similarly, in a book on palliative and end of life care, Grinyer and Barbrachild [16] resorted to the terms \u201cself-limiting\u201d and \u201clife threatening illnesses\u201d as a sub-category of CCHC. Although this term is usually applied to cancer diagnoses, the focus may be HIV/AIDS [21]. Other definitions focused on palliative conditions that could be either life-threatening (cure is possible) or life-limiting (no hope for a cure) [22].",

Bearing this in mind, one must consider that human development is embedded in a broader socio-cultural context, as described in those studies. For CCHC, this context includes factors such as their immediate/larger families, schools, neighborhoods, communities, culture, and peers, among others. For example, a child develops as whole but also simultaneously in domains (physical, motor, socio-emotional, cognitive, etc.). This development is fostered by a loving family, through relationships with parents, siblings, relatives, neighbours, and community members, among others.

Paula\u2019s condition can be easily managed by avoiding the non-common allergy trigger, although this may not be always possible. There is no comorbidity. Despite the potential severity, Paula\u2019s life is not in danger.

This requires long distance travels for a consultation, which may be challenging in the winter.",

Consequences: CCHC require multiple services, including health, psychosocial, educational, and counseling. Care is provided by many clinicians, including pediatricians, other physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists, and social workers, among others. There may be system consequences (i.e. fragmented services), affecting the quality of life not only of CCHC but also of their family and care team.

Stated differently, CCHC were viewed as having challenges due to their more complex developmental and/or care needs. These challenges may be stemming from either chronic or severe/intense conditions, which may be diagnosed or not. As a result, they put more pressure on the healthcare system; some of them may even require complex clinical care. It may be straightforward to recognize a child with complex-to-very-complex conditions, namely in the context of medical complexity [11, 31]. However, identifying CCHC with less complexity becomes complicated because: (1) stakeholders define CCHC differently; (2) it is often harder to capture individual characteristics with population data sources than in one-on-one encounters; and (3) contrary to adults, CCHC often have a spectrum of heterogeneous conditions. Perhaps like adults, some CCHC may have a condition that becomes complex only when comorbid.",
