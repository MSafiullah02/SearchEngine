            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common autoimmune debilitating neurologic diseases that is characterized by demyelination and chronic inflammation of the CNS (Trapp and Nave, 2008). There are two main categories of MS: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). RRMS, the most common type, is typified by irregular relapses followed by month-and-year-periods of relative quiet without symptoms. Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which does not fulfill the MS criteria, is frequently its starting point. PMS includes three types: secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) (Hawkes and Giovannoni, 2010; Confavreux and Vukusic, 2006). The etiology of MS is not clearly but genetic, environmental, immunological factors and some viruses, e.g. EBV, CMV, HBV, HSV, human herpetic viruses 6 and 7, measles viruses, coronaviruses, may have a role in the occurrence of MS (Sospedra and Martin, 2005). Myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers will be damaged in MS (Jiang and Chess, 2006; Dendrou et al., 2015). The major immune cells involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS are T cells, especially TCD8 +, Th1 and Th17. Amounts of Th1 and Th17 cells and their associated cytokines, e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), have been shown to be increased in MS patients (Raphael et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014). In recent years, it became clear that Treg cells also participate in immunopathogenesis of MS (Buc, 2013). Treg cells are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance against self antigens through a variety of soluble mediators including IL-10, IL-35, TGF-\u03b2, and cell surface molecules such as CD25, and CTLA-4 (Tai et al., 2012; Collison et al., 2010). There are multiple Treg subsets and a variety of suppressive mechanisms . Treg cells decrease activity and expansion of conventional T cells by suppressing their biological activities such as inhibition of proliferation and blocking the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Liu, 2006; Lan et al., 2005). Quantitative or functional defect of Treg cells is associated with many autoimmune diseases, including MS, rheumatoid arteritis (RA), and Type 1 diabetes (T1D) (Sakaguchi et al., 2006; Long and Buckner, 2011). The role of Treg cells in MS is controversial. While several studies reported a decrease in Treg cells frequency in MS patients (Huan et al., 2005; Haas et al., 2007; Venken et al., 2008a; Jamshidian et al., 2013; Kouchaki et al., 2014), a number of studies reported the same frequency compared to healthy subjects (Venken et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2005; Feger et al., 2007; Viglietta et al., 2004; Frisullo et al., 2009). Moreover, other studies indicated a functional defect in Treg cells (Venken et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2005; Feger et al., 2007; Frisullo et al., 2009; Sellebjerg et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Venken et al., 2008b). Further studies are needed to understand the potential of Treg-based therapies in MS patients. In this study, we determined the frequency of CD4+CD25highCD127low/\n\u2212 Treg cells in RRMS and PMS patients compared toHC in Ahvaz, the center of Khuzestan province, which is host for living of Fars and Arab ethnic populations.",

Antibodies were purchased from eBioscience company (eBioscience, USA). The cells were stained according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 500 \u03bcl PBS and stored in the dark at 4 \u00b0C prior to do flow cytometry analysis. The monoclonal antibodies used were as follows: FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4 (Clone RPA-T4), PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD25 (clone BC96), and APC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD127 (clone eBioRDR5).

To rule out these phenomena, we used the combination of CD4, high expression of the CD25, and low levels of IL-7 \u03b1-receptor (CD127) expression for identification of Treg cells in peripheral blood (Seddiki et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).",

In accordance with our results, others demonstrated that Treg cells frequency was reduced in RRMS patients compared to the HCs (Huan et al., 2005; Haas et al., 2007; Venken et al., 2008a; Kouchaki et al., 2014; Jamshidian et al., 2013) and the reduced number of Treg cells have been considered as a possible reason for the onset of MS or as a predisposing factor (Venken et al., 2008b; Namdar et al., 2010). Consistent with this observation, may due to the clonal or functional exhausting and more migration of the most potent suppressor cells in RRMS patients to inflammatory sites, the function and frequency of Treg cells is lower in RRMS patients rather than PMS patients (Venken et al., 2006). As shown in the MOG35\u201355 EAE model, in the CNS during remission, there were Treg cells with a high suppressive capacity (Kouchaki et al., 2014). These reports are in accordance with observation of high levels expression of ICAM-1 (CD54) by Treg cells (Venken et al., 2006), and detection of TCD4+ CD25high cells in the CSF of RRMS patients (Haas et al., 2005). According to some studies, Treg cells frequency was not significantly different between MS patients in comparison to HCs (Venken et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2005; Feger et al., 2007; Viglietta et al., 2004; Frisullo et al., 2009). Other studies have shown that even if the number of Treg cells in MS patients is normal, their function is not normal (Venken et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2005; Feger et al., 2007; Frisullo et al., 2009; Venken et al., 2008b; Sellebjerg et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012). Lower Treg suppressive capabilities may cause increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines, for instance, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-\u03b3, and activation of B cells- producing autoantibody. Via contact-dependent and contact-independent suppression of effector T cells (Teff) known to produce IL-6, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, Treg cells usually suppress the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines (Wang et al., 2010; van Mierlo et al., 2008).",
