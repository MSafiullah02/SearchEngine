We found that IL-27 was able to induce the expression of CXCL10 but not IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, or CXCL8, which is consistent with previous reports that IL-27 could stimulate the production of CXCL10 in monocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes.9, 22, 23 In fact, CXCL10 is a pivotal chemokine that contributes to both Th1- and Th2-type airway inflammation,24, 25 and a significantly increased production of CXCL10 has been seen in airway inflammatory diseases such as COPD, PTB, chronic bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome.26, 27, 28, 29 In this study, we found that IL-27 is a novel inducer of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that the IL-27-CXCL10 axis may be particularly important in the development of airway inflammation.",

However, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 could not activate bronchial epithelial cells to produce CXCL10.
