            "text": "One of the people who heard Vice Premier Wu Yi's plea for greater openness in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic was Li Keqiang, now China's Premier but at the time the Party Secretary of Henan province. As we saw in Chap. 2, national specialists such as Xiwen Zheng estimated the number of HIV-infected plasma sellers in Henan at around 80,000, and activists were claiming ten times as many. However, provincial officials stuck stubbornly to an estimate of 10,000 infections. Backed by the central government's renewed determination to find out the true extent of the epidemic, Li Keqiang encouraged his staff to do whatever was necessary to get to the truth. Normally, HIV estimates in countries with epidemics similar to China's are made on the basis of data from sentinel surveillance among high-risk groups. In sentinel surveillance, blood is taken from people at high risk for HIV for some therapeutic purpose (such as for syphilis screening and treatment or assessing patients for drug-related services). The blood is then stripped of personal identifiers and tested for the virus that causes AIDS. That gives health authorities an idea of the overall percentage of people in that risk group who are infected. Applying the percentage to the estimated number of people who share the risk behaviour gives the estimated number of people infected. Of course, some people may be infected even though they are not themselves in one of the high-risk groups included in the estimates -the wife of a drug injector, for example, or the husband of a sex worker. Often, information taken from HIV testing among pregnant women is used as a proxy for these secondary infections.",

            "text": "This estimation method is not very well suited, however, to epidemics that were driven by the selling of blood, because most former plasma sellers would not be captured in the sentinel surveillance of high-risk groups. Rather than basing their estimates of the numbers infected on data from sentinel surveillance sites, health officials in Henan and the National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention took the bold step of trying to find and test all those who might have been put at risk through blood selling. This meant conducting a full door-to-door census and asking every household if anyone in the family had sold blood in the 1990s. Those who said they had indeed sold blood would be offered free HIV testing. Though this would obviously be a huge undertaking, health authorities thought it was the only way to get information good enough to set to rest all the concerns about underreporting of cases.",

Good estimates were needed for planning and monitoring purposes, of course, but to provide people with treatment, health officials needed to know which individuals were infected. Though some voluntary testing services were available in some places, people just weren't using them very much. One study asked participants in a relatively high-prevalence area if they would like to receive more information about HIV, as well as a free HIV test. Vouchers were given to all participants; if they came to the clinic, they could claim a small payment whether or not they got tested. Just short of half said that they would like a test, but only one in six turned up at the clinic to claim their payment, and a tiny 3.7% actually took a free HIV test [1] .",

The citizens of China's badly affected central provinces, including Anhui, had seen what happened to people who had tested positive for HIV. They were fired from their jobs, rejected by their families and turned away from health services. Discrimination was, as Chap. 8 describes in greater detail, more or less universal.

And though a handful of studies showed that people who had learned of their infection following a voluntary test took steps to prevent passing on the virus, there was, for the first two and a half decades of the epidemic, very little benefit for individual patients in knowing they were infected. Because of this, both experts and activists in the international HIV world were fiercely wedded to the principle that all testing should be absolutely voluntary and be accompanied by personalised counselling both before and after the test. They also opposed the disclosure of test results to anyone but the client themselves. Since the mid-1990s, when treatment became available to infected people in industrialised countries, the benefit of HIV testing had grown very considerably: if a person tested positive, they could begin to take antiretroviral medicine that could prolong life by years, even decades. But in lowerincome countries, this treatment was available only to the most privileged few, while discrimination continued to be experienced by virtually everyone with an HIV diagnosis. Because of this, the international community continued to oppose any sort of mass screening, in China or anywhere else.",

They pointed out that China's successes to date in tackling HIV derived from experiments that learned from what had worked in other countries, and they were reluctant to embark on a programme for which there was no international precedent. They were also sceptical that treatment would be made available to people who tested positive, and they were worried about continuing levels of stigma. Others in China's public health establishment argued forcefully that the potentially massive epidemic of HIV spread by blood collection practices in central China put the nation in a very different position from other countries. Screening of former blood sellers in central China would achieve two important goals at once, they said. On the one hand, it would provide a much better understanding of the true extent of the blood-driven epidemic. On the other hand, it would allow local governments to identify people who were living with the virus and provide an entry point for treatment, as well as helping them to target important prevention services to help those who were infected, so that they could take measures to reduce the risk of passing the virus onto their spouses, sexual or injecting partners or infants.",

He was among those who believed that at least in the seven provinces of central China where the blood trade had been most rampant, a one-time testing of everyone who had sold blood in the mid-1990s was justified. Since the outbreak was not ongoing, a well-implemented screening targeted at the hundreds of thousands of people who sold blood at that time should identify a very substantial proportion of those infected. The government's eventual goal was to provide affordable care and antiretroviral treatment for anyone in China who needed it. But if anyone deserved to be at the front of the queue when it came to free treatment, it was surely the families who had been encouraged to sell their blood to supplement their tiny agricultural earnings. Testing former blood sellers would open the door to treatment for them.",

Between June and August 2004, the province conducted a door-to-door census, asking whether anyone in the household had sold blood during the mid-1990s. Some 280,300 people said that they had; every one of them was offered a free HIV test. Since individual pretest counselling was judged to be impractical on such a large scale, people were informed of the process of HIV testing and of its benefits through poster and public information campaigns; campaigns that started before the census was even conducted. \"The testing campaign was a powerful education tool in its own right, not just for the public, but also for policy makers\", observed Wu. \"All those hundreds of thousands of tests, it just normalised HIV testing and really reduced stigma. It went beyond the health system; the testing campaign mobilised all of society to participate\". The government invested a great deal to arrive at this success, not just politically but also financially, according to former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang. \"Government took many measures to support the screening in the regions: building roads, schools, and wells; setting up clinics and providing free treatment\".",

Over 23,000 people were identified for the first time as infected with HIV, 9.0% of those tested. In just 3 months, Henan had identified six times as many newly diagnosed infections as they had reported in the whole of the previous decade. Slightly over half of those were in what are known as \"discordant couples\", where the infected person has a husband or wife who is not infected. Knowing that they were living with the virus provided these men and women with an important opportunity to avoid passing on the infection within the family. Local health staff provided post-test counselling to those who tested positive, as well as free condoms for those who needed them. They also referred people for the follow-up tests they would need to determine whether they were ready to begin treatment, which at that time was offered to people who had fewer than 200 CD4 cells per millilitre of blood, a measure of a severely compromised immune system.

The Ministry of Health expert committee that visited Henan a year after the screening finished found that in the 10 months following the mass screening, over 6700 former plasma sellers had chosen to have voluntary HIV tests. Some of these may have been from among the 23,000 or so identified blood sellers who refused testing during the mass screening. But it was also clear that a lot of people had refused testing in a more passive way, by simply not reporting that they had sold blood. When they saw that people who tested HIV positive in the mass screenings were not persecuted and that many did in fact have access to free treatment as promised, they began to come forward of their own accord to the voluntary testing centres set up by the government in many hospitals and clinics.",

In a careful analysis of data from just four testing sites over the next 7 months, a third of over 700 former blood sellers were found to be infected. That suggests that the woman who chatted with Zunyou Wu was not exceptional. People who suspected they might be infected were more likely than others to avoid participating in the screening but came forward once they saw that they would get financial and health-care support if they did indeed have HIV. However, the committee reported: \"From an analysis of the situation based on data collected through this mass screenings and from discussions with the people involved, the expert group believes that the proportion of former plasma donors who deliberately hid their HIV status is not very high\". They estimated that around 15% of people who had actually sold plasma in the outbreak years and who were still alive at the time of the 2004 census denied having sold blood. Interestingly, the four-site study showed that many other people who had not sold plasma but who thought they might have been exposed in other ways also sought out free HIV tests at public services after the screening. Of the people who feared they might be at risk because they had received a blood transfusion, over half were infected with HIV. Some 39% of the men and women who were worried that they may have been infected with HIV through sex also tested positive.",

It is worth noting, however, that since the outbreak occurred around 1995, many of those infected would have died by the time of the screening a decade later. Without treatment, half of people with otherwise healthy immune systems who contract HIV sexually will have died 9 years after they become infected [5] .

With a Herculean effort but in a very short space of time, it provided a robust idea of the extent of the HIV epidemic in the province, putting to rest fears that local authorities were covering up an epidemic. The public, policymakers and health-care providers all learned a great deal about HIV during the campaign; the stigma that continues to loom over the disease was dented, and many people lost their fear of HIV testing. Most importantly, the screening ratcheted up access to prevention and treatment services for those affected, in part because it identified those in need of care, but also because it motivated service providers to work more effectively. \"Our efforts had a good impact in terms of HIV prevention and control, and made the international community change its attitude towards the screening\", observed former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang. Following Henan's success, the Ministry of Health in Beijing encouraged the other provinces that had an active blood trade to screen all people who had sold plasma there, too. These mass screenings were implemented between October 2004 and June 2005. By the end of June 2005, among 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities excluding Xinjiang, a total of 1,274,046 former plasma sellers had been registered, and 904,746 of them (71%) had been tested for HIV. A total of 25,030 were confirmed HIV positive, giving an overall HIV prevalence among former plasma sellers of 2.8%.",

Unlike former blood sellers, people who took drugs and sold and bought sex were considered by many to have brought the disease upon themselves. On top of that, the behaviours that had resulted in their contracting HIV were illegal. And unlike the wave of plasma-driven infections, Yunnan's epidemic was not a one-time outbreak confined to the past. New infections were taking place every day.

But they were also concerned that the screening would be damaging to gay men, sex workers and above all drug users, exposing them to arrest and increasing the stigma with which they had to cope daily. Public health officials who supported screening all those at high risk, on the other hand, argued that approaches developed in an age before treatment was available, and that prioritised an individual's privacy above all else, were inappropriate in an age of treatment. \"The international community was very critical, saying this was a violation of human rights, and of course not international best practice\", remembers Zunyou Wu.

But the history of the AIDS epidemic, coming to light as it did among gay men in the United States at a time when homophobia was the norm in that country, had led activists to argue that protecting the right to privacy and non-discrimination of infected individuals was every bit as important as controlling the spread of the virus. \"There's a tension between public health and [individual] human rights\" conceded Wu. \"The way we see it, we feel like there is an obligation to protect the public, especially the uninfected\".

Over the last 3 months of 2004, the provincial health authorities identified 424,000 people as being eligible for testing because they were pregnant or at high risk for HIV infection. These included people who were married to or were the child of someone known to have HIV, people who suffered from another sexually transmitted infection or a disease that thrives in people with damaged immune systems and people whose behaviour exposed them to HIV, principally drug injectors and sex workers. Former plasma sellers were also included on the list. All these people were invited to have a free HIV test, and 98.7% of them agreed -a remarkably high rate which prompted some people to question the \"voluntary\" nature of the test. Obviously some people, including people in detention or rehabilitation for taking drugs or selling sex, were in no real position to refuse testing.",

Most other provinces had emulated Yunnan and greatly increased testing in the groups most at risk for HIV. This information, added to step up sentinel surveillance, was critical to building up a more accurate picture of the epidemic in this vast and hugely diverse country. The other important component of better estimates, every bit as influential in the final results, was the estimated size of each risk population. By testing a fixed number of people in a given risk population over a couple of weeks once a year, sentinel surveillance systems could provide a fairly robust picture of HIV prevalence for each risk group. For example, a sentinel site for drug users in one county in Yunnan might report that 87 of 200 drug injectors had tested positive for HIV. In other words, HIV prevalence among injectors in that area was 43.5%. Similarly, testing of 200 female sex workers in a market town in Guangdong found only one infection, so prevalence there would be 0.5%. To turn that into an estimate of the total numbers infected, we have to know 43.5% of what? Half a percent of how many? In the mid-2000s, only a handful of countries worldwide had made systematic and transparent estimates of the numbers of people in each of the groups that carry an especially high risk of exposure to HIV. China was one of the first.",

Eventually, they settled on variations on what are known as \"multiplier methods\". In multiplier methods, you take a known quantity, and then use other data, sometimes from a survey, sometimes from a different, unrelated source, to estimate data that are missing from the original list. It would not be practical, for example, to count every single sex worker in every single establishment in a town. But most towns do have a list of licensed massage parlours, karaoke bars and night clubs and beauty salons. A \"quick and dirty\" survey in the town might reveal that 90% of karaoke bars and clubs, 50% of massage parlours and just 15% of beauty parlours are licensed. During the same survey, researchers count the number of women employed at a random subset of those establishments and the number that sell sex. This information can then be applied to the list of licensed premises. First, researchers construct a \"complete list\", adjusting the number upwards to reflect the missing establishments in each category. Then they multiply the number of establishments by the average number of women selling sex in each type of location. Of course many more sophisticated adjustments can be made, but overall, multiplier methods have now been shown to provide fairly robust estimates of the number of people engaged in high-risk behaviours in many different countries and settings.",

But a country as large and diverse as China must make estimates at much lower administrative levels. In 2005, for the first time, enough data were available to try to make systematic estimates at the level of the prefecture (the highest administrative level after the province).

To protect against this, and to arrive at the most accurate estimates, the group leading the estimation process in 2005 espoused a fundamental principle. They would construct the spreadsheets so that the outputs -the absolute numbers infected -were hidden from participants in the process. Those participants included a wide range of people who had information or experience to contribute to the exercise: among them local health staff and people from the public security bureau, from the department overseeing the entertainment industry and from groups providing prevention and care services to those at risk. All had to agree on two things: the methods and the input data.

This put the country's leaders in a quandary. On the one hand, they had just made a huge political commitment to tackling the HIV epidemic honestly and transparently. In other words, they had committed to telling the truth about the magnitude of the epidemic. On the other hand, that truth, arrived at using internationally sanctioned methods, showed that the HIV problem was not as severe as had been anticipated. Indeed the estimate was only three-quarters as high as the government's own previous estimate. This was bound to lead to accusations of a cover-up.
