            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as novel COVID-19, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The disease rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. Previous studies suggest that COVID-19 is more likely to infect older adult men, particularly those with chronic comorbidities. [6] [7] [8] In the isolation ward of the children's hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, three children were hospitalised with pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Two were sisters, aged 6 and 8 years old and one was a 6-month-old boy. All three patients had fever, and two had nasal congestion and rhinitis, associated with fatigue, diarrhoea and headache. The 6-yearold girl mainly had cough. None had dyspnoea or cyanosis. Their computerised tomographic scans are shown in Figures 1-3 . None of the children required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications.",

Through everybody's effort, careful treatment, psychological nursing support and infection control measures in hospital, these children recovered completely and were discharged safely (Video S1, Supporting Information).
