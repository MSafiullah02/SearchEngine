The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit admission. Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited. We herein report six patients who developed acute stroke during COVID-19 infection. Methods A retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, who developed clinical and neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Six patients were identified (5 men); median age was 69 years (range 57-82). Stroke subtypes were ischemic (4, 67%) and hemorrhagic (2, 33%). All patients but one had pre-existing vascular risk factors. One patient developed encephalopathy prior to stroke, characterized by focal seizures and behavioral abnormalities. COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe (i.e., requiring critical care support) in 5/6 cases (83%). Liver enzyme alteration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation were registered in all cases. Four patients (67%) manifested acute kidney failure prior to stroke. Four patients (67%) had abnormal coagulation tests. The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: five died (83%) and the remaining one (17%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4). Conclusions Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke can complicate the course of COVI-19 infection. In our series, stroke developed mostly in patients with severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, liver enzymes and LDH were markedly increased in all cases, and the outcome was poor.",

The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum associated with COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission [2] [3] [4] . Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited, but previous reports from the SARS epidemic in Asia in 2003 suggested a higher incidence of thromboembolic complications, including stroke [5] . Management of acute stroke in the setting of this pandemic disease poses unique challenges, including the need to maintain high-quality stroke care with limited resources, while at the same time preventing infection spread to patients and physicians [6] . A better characterization of cerebrovascular complications associated with COVID-19 infection is important to guide decision making.",

We included only patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital, Brescia, Italy, or the Udine University Hospital, Udine, Italy, between March 16 and April 5, 2020. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on nasopharyngeal swabs. Demographic data, information on clinical presentation and evolution, and laboratory and radiologic results were recorded. The severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was rated using the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen) which was indicated whenever available. Acute lung injury is present if PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio is \u2264 300 [7] . Each diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by brain computed tomography (CT)/CT angiography (CTA), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All examinations were reviewed by two experienced neuroradiologists (DB, MM). Neurological presentations were reviewed by one experienced neurologist (AV). Descriptive analysis is presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as the median and range for continuous variables. All procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional ethics committee and the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Chest CT demonstrated diffuse bilateral groundglass opacities with no pleural effusion (Fig. 3e) . On day 5, his respiratory function worsened and he was transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation. He was treated with 4000 IU enoxaparin daily subcutaneously. Despite regular cardiac activity and well-supported respiratory function, 7 days after admission in ICU his neurological conditions suddenly deteriorated. The patient was found with bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils, with a GCS of 3. A brain CT (Fig. 3f -h) demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema with a large right frontal hemorrhage (6.0 \u00d7 5.2 cm on the axial plane) extending to the ventricular system. The ventricles were displaced across the midline. Four additional smaller intra-axial hemorrhages occurred in both hemispheres. Coagulation tests were normal. Shortly after CT examination, the patient died.",

            "text": "We report the clinical and neuroimaging features of six patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed acute stroke, four ischemic and two hemorrhagic. At the time the cerebrovascular complications ensued, all but one patient needed critical care support and most of them had evidence of multiorgan failure. Most of the patients were elderly male with comorbidities. Ischemic lesions were typically multiple and bilateral, suggesting an embolic etiology. Conversely, the detection of simultaneous multiple intracerebral hemorrhages associated with severe brain edema is unprecedented in this setting and raises important issues in the management of patients with Covid-19. Taken together, these factors could account for the poor outcome observed in this cohort. Given the fact that vascular risk factors were frequent, the association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke might be coincidental. Nevertheless, a body of epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of thromboembolic complications, including neurovascular diseases, in the acute phase of infection. In particular, previous experiences from other coronavirus-related diseases, the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have highlighted stroke, pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction as possible complications, especially in critically ill patients [5, 8] . Additionally, a recent report from Wuhan, China, showed that acute cerebrovascular disease is not uncommon in COVID-19, and it represents a negative prognostic factor. Among 221 infected patients, 11 (5%) developed ischemic stroke, 1 (0.5%) cerebral venous thrombosis, and 1 (0.5%) brain hemorrhage [9] . In agreement with the finding of the present study, it was also observed that cardiovascular risk factors were common, while the patients demonstrated increased biomarkers of inflammatory response as well as a hypercoagulable state [9] .",

            "text": "The relationship between acute infection and stroke is complex and it was demonstrated for many types of bacterial and viral infections. Importantly, an increased risk of stroke was documented after respiratory infections, including influenza, and the risk was highest within the first week [10] . Accordingly, measures to prevent viral illnesses (e.g., influenza vaccination) were shown to be protective for the development of cerebrovascular disease [11] . Intriguingly, the association between infection and stroke is also relevant for patients with preexistent risk factors. In this group, the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques to rupture appears to be increased in the presence of systemic inflammation and sepsis [10] . The mechanisms by which viral infections can trigger stroke are multiple and depend on the associated pathogen and host characteristics. For example, varicella zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for a distinctive vasculopathy involving both large and small arteries, which can result in ischemic infarction of the brain and spinal cord, as well as subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage [12] . At autopsy, the cerebral arteries showed disruption of the internal elastic lamina and multinucleated giant cells, while the presence of VZV DNA was demonstrated in the posterior cerebral and basilar arteries [13] . Similarly, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a known cause of large vessel vasculopathy (mainly aneurysmal) that can also involve the brain [14] . A vasculitic-like mechanism can also apply in the context of COVID-19, since localized fibrinoid necrosis as well as infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls were demonstrated in three cases of the 2003 SARS disease [15] . Interestingly enough, another type of coronavirus (New Haven CoV) was associated with the development of systemic vasculitis of childhood (Kawasaki disease) in a case-control study [16] . An alternative mechanism leading to stroke during the course of an infection is the presence of a pro-thrombotic state. Numerous reports have documented various coagulation abnormalities (in particular, raised D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, and isolated prolonged aPTT) in patients with SARS-CoV, nearly two decades ago [17, 18] . Chong et al. studied an autopsy series of eight SARS patients and demonstrated the presence of pulmonary embolism in half of them, while one patient developed non-bacterial valvular vegetations associated with infarctions of the heart, kidneys, spleen, and occipital lobe [18] . Similarly, an underlying thrombophilic state can also be hypothesized in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as suggested by a report of pulmonary embolism in patients from Wuhan [19] and in Patient 1 of the present series who also presented brain and spleen lesions suggestive for embolization.",
