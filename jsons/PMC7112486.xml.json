            "text": "The analysis of the epidemic threshold is a very important topic for the study of the\ndynamical behavior and control methods for epidemic spreading on complex networks. Many\nreported results have shown that the topological structure of an epidemic network plays a\nvital role in its epidemic threshold. By using the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) method on\na standard SIS epidemic network,1 its\nepidemic threshold is given by \u03b2c=\u27e8k\u27e9/\u27e8k2\u27e9, where \u27e8k\u27e9 and \u27e8k2\u27e9 are the first and second\nmoments of the network degree distribution. By using linear stability analysis on an SIS\nMarkovian epidemic network, a more exact result is that the epidemic threshold is given by\n\u03b2c = 1/\u03bb1, where\n\u03bb1 is the largest eigenvalue of the network's adjacency\nmatrix.2\u20134 With this observation,\nthe influence of the network topological characteristics on the spreading behaviour has been\nfurther investigated in depth.5\u20138\nFinally, by embedding more realistic factors into traditional epidemic networks, many\nepidemic thresholds have been derived on multiplex networks such as epidemic networks with\nawareness,9\u201313\ntraffic-driven epidemic networks,14,15\nepidemic networks with community structure,16,17 interconnected epidemic networks,18\u201320 time-varying epidemic networks,21\u201323 adaptive epidemic network,24,25 and so on.",

In a real (social) epidemic\nnetwork, each individual generally has both deterministic neighboring nodes (e.g., family\nand relatives) and stochastic nodes (e.g., colleagues and strangers). In fact, the\nwell-known NW small-world network26 is\ngenerated using this same idea to address the transition properties between regular-lattice\nand random-lattice behavior in social networks. Consequently, the whole network can be\ndivided into two unattached sub-networks: deterministic network and stochastic network. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this network division method has not been applied to the study of\nepidemic transmission on networks or epidemic thresholds. In addition, different people have\ngenerally different probabilities for the connections with these stochastic neighboring\nnodes. Hence, the diversity of connection probability should be considered to obtain more\nreasonable models (see the case of nonuniform stochastic connections in Sec. IV). For universality, individual awareness and community\nstructure will be also considered in our models. It is well known that many social networks\nhave the community structures, where there exists a high density of intra-connections within\neach community, and a lower density of inter-connections between communities. In view of\nthese (above) factors, to achieve the epidemic threshold estimation, we will first construct\nseveral SIS Markovian epidemic networks with deterministic and stochastic connections.",
