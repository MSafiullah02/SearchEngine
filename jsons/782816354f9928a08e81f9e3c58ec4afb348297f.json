            "text": "Health psychology is a relatively new field and international health psychology even newer. Anthropologists and cross-cultural psychologists have worked in Africa and Asia for many years, but I rarely find another health psychologist when I work in the poorest countries. With their skills they would have a great deal to offer. Health psychologists know not only about cultural differences but also about basic cognitive and social processes as they apply to health problems. They know how to use qualitative and quantitative methods to describe problems and evaluate solutions. Health psychologists generally are problem-focused: they study health problems where social-psychological and behavioral processes are part of the problem. Health psychologists are also solution-focused. They are not satisfied with simply describing and measuring stress and its effect on health; they also want to evaluate ways to reduce stress. They study diet and exercise and ways to enhance these and other lifestyles through health promotion. International health psychologists use the same problem-and solution-focused approach in developing countries. Working with a local team of experts who have identified the pressing local health problems, they examine sources of the problem and ways to tackle it. The problems are different in developing countries, but the steps taken to solve them may not be. If you cannot use public service television advertising to tell people about the benefits of breast feeding and bed nets, you can nonetheless train community health workers or teachers to provide lively entertainment-education on these topics to groups of people. Instead of tackling heart disease, stroke, and cancer, international health psychologists tackle diseases of children who die in large numbers or are left physically and mentally disabled by the age of 5. They also focus on women who are at greater risk than men of getting HIV, who die or are disabled as a result of giving birth, and who are the guardians of their family's health, yet have little decision-making power. Instead of working with hospitals where only a small minority of the population go for treatment, international health psychologists work with rural communities and village health workers to prevent death and disease.",

First, we have come to realize that we can learn from problems and solutions being evaluated in other countries. We can learn how people from different cultures think about causes of illness and find strikingly similar ways of thinking in our own country. We can learn how strategies to change health behavior have succeeded or failed in other countries, for example with respect to abstinence and condom use, and adjust our own strategies accordingly. We can broaden our theories, for example theories of stress and coping or theories of behavior change, on the basis of research in developing countries. Second, psychologists have an important role to play in improving the health of people in developing countries.",

            "text": "As health psychologists with a population health perspective, we are welcomed by multi-disciplinary teams of researchers and health workers who attempt to resolve health problems through environmental, social, psychological, and medical changes. Prevention of illness is less expensive than cure, and psychologists are experts in preventive behaviors. Health workers, therefore, seek input from psychologists to help them promote a large array of good health behaviors. For example, hand-washing and home management of dehydration far exceed hospital or medical treatments of diarrhea. Behavior change in the use of treated mosquito bed nets are at the forefront of the fight against malaria, given that no vaccine is yet available. Abstinence and condom use are still the only ways to prevent HIV. Having a birth plan to give birth at a clinic rather than at home increases a woman's chance of surviving without disability -in many countries, delivering a baby is riskier than an abortion. Persuading mothers to breast feed their infants for 6 months and to serve animal source foods and vegetables to their young children are keys to overcoming the appalling levels of malnutrition. Psychologists may not study viruses and vaccines, but they know more than others about attitude and behavior change.",

More and more young people are traveling out of curiosity about others and a desire for personal growth. They feel a sense of responsibility at least to be informed about the struggles of people who live in other countries. Some want to work abroad, after their degree, with Peace Corps or one of the many non-governmental organizations such as World Vision or Save the Children. Most are relatively na\u00efve about the challenges they will encounter, but they are eager and well-intentioned. Other students are critical of these adventurers and accuse them of being \"neocolonials\" and \"cultural universalists.\" My class always has a rousing debate on these two positions. Some students mistakenly think that American psychologists parachute themselves into remote places and start controlling people's health behaviors. The reality is that we are visiting experts who work alongside local people who want to change. Organizations are happy to have students, not because they have the skills to really make a difference, but because they are the international experts of the future. Their international perspective will help American donors set proper priorities for the fight against hunger, illiteracy, HIV, and malaria. They will understand that the usual strategies of funding hospitals and expensive equipment are not the best solutions. Students with a background in psychology will see first-hand that their skills in the area of environmental, social, and behavioral change are put to good use. As part of class preparation, students can be encouraged to Google organizations welcoming young volunteers and at the same time discover the common problems faced by people in places such as Africa and South Asia.",

Among the eight goals, to be reached by the year 2015, are reducing hunger, child deaths, women's deaths during delivery, and infectious diseases such as HIV and malaria. To accomplish these are goals that include clean sources of water, proper waste disposal, use of skilled birth attendants, use of condoms and other forms of contraception, and gender equality in education. Although some but not all of the goals will be met on time, by some but not all regions of the world, their ratification by all countries belonging to the United Nations provides an incentive to work cooperatively.

Environmental health including sources of clean water, waste disposal, and personal hygiene. Water shortage is a worldwide obsession and a looming problem for the USA. Why is water in developing countries unclean, and what are the consequences for health? This is a story of health behavior change in particular as it relates to waste disposal, hand-washing and face-washing at the family level. It extends to the use of mosquito nets and condoms. Psychologists are famous for their theories of behavior change but most theories have not worked well in developing countries. Why not? There is ample scholarly space for insightful and creative students to answer this question. 3. Eliminating child hunger and its disabling effects on physical growth and cognitive development. While nine to ten million children under 5 years die each year from preventable causes, another 200 million are unable to reach their psychological potential because they lack food and stimulation. As psychologists, we grasp the tragedy of such waste. One-third of children in developing countries are short for their age, meaning they have suffered long-term hunger. A similar proportion of American children are overweight. Two lectures, back to back, on obesity and hunger provide an instructive contrast.",

Health psychology students would enjoy arguing about the social, cultural, and ethical issues involved. Even where shared decision making and privacy are not cultural norms, women may still want both. Finally, alcohol and tobacco abuse are increasing in developing countries. In the USA, health education in schools target youth and environmental restrictions regulate where and to whom these items can be sold.

My students get the latest .pdf copies of the tables at the back of the UNICEF document called The State of the World's Children. There are statistics on the proportion of children who die before their fifth birthday. This is the most telling indicator of a nation's overall health: If you cannot keep your children alive, then those who survive must also be doing poorly and their mothers must be in poor physical and mental health as well. There are also figures on how long people can expect to live, maternal mortality, malnutrition, literacy, HIV prevalence among young people, condom use, immunization, how much donor money goes into the country (called Official Development Assistance or ODA), and funds spent on health. This and more information is available about each country, about regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and about groupings of countries such as the 50 least developed countries and 39 industrialized countries. You can also see how each indicator is defined and its source of data. One instructive group assignment for students is to give them a list of indicators, then let them pick a country in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America for which they find the indicator data. In the end, the instructor creates a composite table in full view of all, fielding figures from the three groups and inserting them into the table. The three columns of figures for, say, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Nicaragua may be compared with each other and with a fourth column of figures for the USA.

So we go doorto-door, using what is called \"the sisterhood method\" along with a verbal autopsy. We interview women between 15 and 49 years and ask about their adult sisters' survival. For those sisters who died, time of death along with details of the circumstances and symptoms prior to death is recorded. If the death occurred during pregnancy, delivery or up to 42 days after delivery, from causes related to or aggravated by the pregnancy, it is a case of maternal mortality. Obviously, a much more reliable method is possible when health researchers set up a demographic surveillance site as they did in Matlab, Bangladesh in the 1960s. Each year they visit households, asking about births, pregnancies, deaths, health, and illness. The following year, outcomes of the pregnancy will be recorded.

The first set of causes include early marriage; parents arrange for their daughters to get married in their late teens perhaps to avoid her getting pregnant out of wedlock or to have one less person to feed. Usually, they arrange an early marriage simply because everyone else in the village does and questions will be asked if a girl of 20 is still not married. Young brides and their families want children immediately because motherhood is a girl's primary role and confers status. Young bodies, especially bodies that are short due to malnutrition, do not have a fully developed birth canal; the fetus is likely to be either too large for the birth canal or low birth-weight. Young girls who live in an area across mid-Africa have likely undergone a procedure called genital cutting which produces inflexible scar tissue; this further impedes smooth passage of the fetus leading to the rupture of the birth canal. If the woman is young and lacks primary school education, she may be unaware of these risks. She has simply followed the wishes of her family and the practices of her community. If she has not completed fifth grade, she is not sufficiently literate to read about alternative available practices. Health psychologists study the cultural, social, and behavioral practices that prepare girls for safe motherhood.",

Part of the preparation entails prenatal visits to an obstetrician to check on the mother's weight gain and blood pressure and to check on the fetus' vital signs. In the least developed countries, particularly those in Africa and South Asia, only 60% seek prenatal (known as antenatal) care. The others claim that because they did not experience a problem, they did not need to go. The purpose of antenatal care, however, is prevention. For example, if it looks like the baby is too large for the mother's pelvic gap, a cesarean section may be planned. To prevent malaria during pregnancy, she may be given anti-malarial pills; if she is anemic (and most are), she may be given iron and folic acid supplements. Many of these services are provided free of charge by government clinics. So health psychologists may try to create pictorial leaflets with messages that motivate pregnant women, without scaring them, to seek antenatal care. Our involvement with screening programs for cancer gives us a sense of how difficult it is to motivate women who fear bad news.",

Often she is too young or unmarried, perhaps pregnant through rape, or already has more children than she can care for. Some 22% of pregnancies result in induced abortion: safe abortions have little risk, but unsafe abortions often end in death and account for one-third of maternal deaths.

Overall, India and Bangladesh have close to 60% use of modern contraception. Latin America 70%. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest use at 23%. Education importantly increases the chances that both husband and wife will want to use contraception.

Once laws were passed requiring seat belt use, almost everyone buckled up and subsequently their attitudes changed in favor of seat belts. This is a good example of how governments can regulate health behaviors for the good of all, and let supportive attitudes follow in their wake. Another example is smoking: governments regulate the age when one can purchase cigarettes and places where you cannot smoke -the latter being an example of social responsibility. The age of alcohol purchase was raised in the USA as a result of alcohol abuse and drunk driving by high school and college students. The people of China and India have social norms about limiting one's family size; in many African countries, the norm is to have many children. In the USA, there is no strong prescriptive norm: some have no children, some have the usual two, and some have more.",

            "text": "A new and interesting research topic concerns HIV, pregnancy, and transmission to the newborn. Women between the ages of 18 and 24 are more than twice as likely as young men to become HIV-positive. Pregnancy increases her chances of becoming HIV-positive as does having an older male partner or husband (who had premarital or extramarital sexual experience). So for a number of biological and social reasons, pregnant women have additional risks due to potential HIV infection. A newborn child has a 35% chance of becoming infected, mostly during delivery and partly from breast milk. This is known as vertical transmission of HIV. Drugs given to mothers at the time of delivery prevent vertical transmission. However, expectant mothers need to first find out whether or not they are HIV-positive. They need to go to a clinic that provides voluntary counseling and testing (known as VCT). Antenatal clinics in high HIV countries now offer this service as standard care. So, persuading pregnant women to attend an antenatal clinic is the first step. Then convincing her to accept testing is the second step. On average about 70% do accept, with a range of 33-100%. The reasons why they are reluctant to get tested include cost (though the cost is usually subsidized by the organization or government running it), fear of emotional trauma, fear of losing her husband or partner, and fear of social stigma. The fear factor may explain why some women agree to get tested but do not return for the test results, and why so few notify their partners of their status. Women who deliver at home have an extra responsibility to take the medication themselves at the right time. Health psychologists may have a special role to play evaluating women's fears and training counselors to be client-focused and sensitive. Thailand and Uganda have the best records for tackling their HIV problems through open dialog and easy access to services. We might learn from them something to apply at home and elsewhere (see Glick 2005 , for more details).",

However, because of our profligate practices, we will soon have to start worrying about water. Elsewhere in the world, water has always been a problem -finding enough water, finding clean water, and finding water to keep clean. Unclean water, unclean disposal of waste (personal waste), and unclean hygienic practices are the cause of much ill health in developing countries. Most of this illness could be prevented through health behaviors that create and sustain a clean environment. The United Nations declared 2005-2015 as the decade for action on Water for Life.

So two strategies are pursued: persuading people to use latrines and having hand-drillers put a pipe down to raise water from a lower water table. The former requires a change in health behavior and the latter requires technical skill and materials. Ethiopia has one of the lowest percentages of people using safe water and latrines: only 22% drink safe water and 13% use latrines. When we lived in Ethiopia, we boiled our water before drinking but of course no one else did. Most rural people defecated on the ground either in the bushes or around their home. Children's feces are particularly contaminated. So a government needs to ensure that water is brought up from a deeper level and attached to a hand pump. Cities generally provided the infrastructure for clean water and latrines, but rural people had neither.",

Still, people like to explain their misfortunes, so a number of interesting causal attributions get passed down the generations: Diarrhea comes from the eruption of baby teeth; hepatitis if you urinate at night facing the moon; malaria from morning mists; a cough and cold from cold weather. More serious illnesses come from the evil eye of a person or supernatural spirits that inhabit streams, animals, and trees. These are regarded as traditional beliefs, but their similarity around the world suggests that they arise not from a particular culture but from a universal need to understand uncontrolled causes of ill health. Beliefs may arise from noticed correlations. For example, baby teeth tend to erupt at an age when children start crawling, and crawlers pick up contaminated soil on their fingers and then suck them. Likewise, malaria comes from mosquitoes which propagate on stagnant waters, from which mist coincidently arises in the early morning. We all have health beliefs. It is difficult to break the transmission of such beliefs, as we know from the \"cold\" belief and from other false HIV beliefs. Do we need to change such beliefs to change the health behaviors that stop the transmission of microbes?",

The most common is rotavirus, causing diarrhea; also Escherichia coli bacteria and cholera. There are the common cold viruses which may lead to pneumonia and other more serious respiratory illnesses. Anemia is largely caused by hookworms, which thrive in contaminated soil. Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito. Trachoma, an eye infection, is caused by a bacteria carried by flies. We still have viral diarrhea and the common cold and cough in the USA, but no one dies from them except perhaps the frail elderly. We used to have malaria and trachoma but we succeeded in quarantining patients and controlling the mosquitoes and flies that carry them. However, infections such as these cause death, malnutrition and debilitating illness in Africa and Asia. Over six million children each year die from diarrhea and pneumonia; many more are left weak and malnourished from repeated bouts of these illnesses. Millions suffer from recurring episodes of malaria and are unable to work while the fever rages; but pregnant women and children are most likely to die especially from a cerebral form of malaria or anemia. Trachoma is active in 84 million people and is already responsible for blindness in 1.3 million people. Primary prevention of diarrhea, respiratory illness, and trachoma can be largely accomplished if everyone used a latrine and washed their hands and face, known as sanitation and personal hygiene. Prevention of malaria requires the use of insecticide-treated nets at home (Lindblade et al 2004) . These are health behaviors that stop infections from being transmitted from one person to another or from an insect to a person. (As an aside, secondary prevention is the second line of action once the person has the illness and needs to prevent adverse consequences: Prevention of death from diarrhea, which is due to dehydration, requires oral rehydration sachets and zinc to replenish lost water and nutrients; unfortunately uninformed mothers withhold food and fluid in the hopes of stopping water loss. Prevention of death from pneumonia requires recognition of the signs in a young child and obtaining antibiotics from a health clinic. Antibiotic creams are also used to prevent blindness from untreated trachoma. Secondary prevention is costly; it is also ineffective in the long-term because a month or year later the microbes are back). Sanitation, personal hygiene and using bed nets are, therefore, the new health behaviors people need to adopt to prevent the misery of these illnesses.",

Psychologists are expert at belief, attitude, and behavior change; we have a number of well-tested theories to take to the field. But we were not in the field when well-meaning programmers popularized what is called \"behavior change communication.\" It refers to the use of communication to inform people and thereby persuade them to change their health behaviors. The strategy relied solely on the use of information to change beliefs and attitudes. However, what is known as the KAP Gap appeared again and again, demonstrating the wide gap between Knowledge (K), Attitude (A), and Practice (P). Changing people's knowledge and attitudes about microbes, water, and latrines did not change their behavior (e.g., Bilqis et al. 1994; Stanton et al. 1987) . Health education by itself is rarely sufficient, because most people do not use the systematic route to persuasion (Glanz et al. 2002; Petty and Cacioppo 1986) . Wellreasoned arguments and cognitive elaborations do not always guide one's behavior. Too much theory testing has been conducted with college students, who are unsurprisingly cognitive. We might learn more about the heuristic route, if we tested our theories in rural areas of developing countries. Here, habits are learned young and overlearned through practice. What can our theories of behavior change tell us about how to change health behaviors and sustain the change?",

Absence of debilitating illness ought to be pleasant enough, but it is not a concrete and immediate consequence -no one notices its absence. As an assignment, students may be encouraged to search through their known theories to line them up in the before, during, and after categories (of ABC where A=antecedent, B=behavior, and C=consequences). We have so much to learn about applying theories of behavior change to serious health behaviors in developing countries. We are still learning from our mistakes. I find that the best way to present this information to students is through case studies. There are generally one or two research articles on a specific program to change health behaviors and whether or not they were successful. Students like to dissect and evaluate the program. Each can be analyzed in terms of theories of behavior change and the ABC elements. The Antecedent element may come in the form of self-determination theory (intrinsic and extrinsic motivation) and the health belief model which argues for a reminder cue in the environment. The Behavior element is implemented through the development and rehearsal of new behavior skills with the help of a model, derived from social learning and social cognitive theory. The Consequence element may entail self-efficacy, self-reward, or a positive health outcome. If you use the Communication framework, students can analyze who was the sender, who the receiver, and what was the message; but then they will want to know if the resultant cognitive/attitude change translated into behavior change. To examine its sustainability, students may need to know more about social norms and social support. In this regard, a new model of community readiness, pioneered in the USA, is now being applied to norm change in developing countries (e.g., McCoy et al. 2007 ).",

But they were not in the habit of washing. We decided to increase hand-washing at two key points -after defecation and before eating -by posting visual reminder cues at these two locations. We also encouraged families to have a water bucket with soap just inside the door of their home and beside the latrine. A few village sessions were given in which one person from each family was coached while washing their hands with soap and water; that person then took responsibility for ensuring that the family washed their hands. Curtis and Cairncross (2003) have reviewed this extensive literature which is now very relevant to North Americans. Women are generally better at this than men but we all need notices posted in critical places to remind us.

Tanzania is a water-poor country so the goal of a long-standing project was not only to promote washing children's faces but also helping families overcome the water shortage which they said stood in the way of daily hygiene (Lynch et al. 1994; McCauley et al. 1990 ). The social norm implicitly understood by everyone was that precious water and time would be wasted on a child's face. No woman wanted to be criticized for being wasteful. Furthermore, her action might be interpreted as vanity, provoking the evil eye from an envious neighbor. The researchers, therefore, tried to build a community consensus by demonstrating that 30 people could wash their faces with water from a small gourd. Peer educators from the village visited individual families to help them identify reusable water for face-washing (clean water is not necessary) and a convenient time and to reward improvements. In the end, one village received eye ointment only and their levels of trachoma initially dropped but rose again 1 year later. Two villages with the behavior change strategy had more clean faces and less trachoma, but still not enough to eliminate trachoma entirely. A fourth village with the behavior change strategy showed no change at all: some women persisted in shaming mothers who washed their children's faces so the stubborn social norm proved to be an obstacle. Recent studies find that mass antibiotic treatment for whole villages succeed in reducing trachoma but not in eliminating it. Consequently without face-washing, a resurgence follows.",

Building latrines may go part way toward solving the problem; any family with a shovel and some local material can build themselves a latrine. But latrines have to be used; some villages and schools like to keep their donor-supplied latrines spotless and unused. One latrine promotion program was tried in rural Ethiopia, where only 7% of the people use latrines. Community leaders and health workers constructed demonstration latrines for families to view and copy (O'Loughlin et al. 2006 ). Within 6 months, 50% of households had built and 45% used their latrine. Social pressure is usually applied when the community gets involved. In Bangladesh, community groups made a map of where every family defecated and this was discussed by the community at-large, who then made a decision to ban open defecation in their village (Kar 2005) . People who could not find the intrinsic motivation to comply presumably found the extrinsic motivation after being subjected to shame. The combination of latrines, social pressure, and accompanying information seems to have led to change in most of these studies. Knowledge and attitudes by themselves work too slowly and are infrequently translated into behavior.

You cannot stop babies from sucking their fingers; you cannot force everyone to wear shoes to protect them from hookworm. There would have to be constant handand face-washing. That is why 100% latrine use is essential. Malaria also relies on behavior change, though a vaccine in the foreseeable future might obviate the need for nets. Social marketing in Malawi raised people's awareness of affordable bed nets but could not raise ownership and use above 20%. However, in Kenya, an organization called Population Services International (PSI) started a subsidized program in rural child health clinics. Two years later the Kenyan government distributed free nets to all children less than 5 years. Without going through a complicated explanation of why children more than adults needed the nets, distributors realized that giving the nets to children ensured that they were seen as child protection. Within 2 years, the percentage of children less than 5 years sleeping under nets rose from 7 to 67% (Noor et al. 2007) . Is this sustainable? Students can look up \"Kenya bed nets\" on the internet to find out.",

Because this is a topic already covered from an American perspective, students will know that abstinence and condom use are the preventive measures to be taken by youth. Many American researchers are transporting ideas and behavior change strategies between the USA and Africa. Simply providing knowledge to African students is insufficient according to a review of these studies (Gallant and Maticka-Tyndale 2004) . For example, Bonita Stanton et al. (1998) found that abstinence was sustained for girls; for boys neither abstinence nor condom use was sustained. William R. Brieger et al. (2001) found that peer educators who met youth in bars to promote condom use convinced school-going youth to use condoms, but did not manage to convert out-of-school youth. For the former, behavior change preceded and exceeded attitude and knowledge change. Because HIV infections are increasing most rapidly among youth aged 15-24, and because the development of Africa depends on its youth, social scientists are looking for behavior change strategies with hard evidence for their effectiveness (Jewkes et al. 2006 (Jewkes et al. , 2008 .",

Most of these children live in developing countries, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, in some countries such as India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Niger, and Zambia, 50% of children are stunted. Stunting, or being short for your age, is now known to be the central indicator of long-term malnutrition. Although famine and hunger grab headlines, chronically under-fed children go unrecognized by journalists and even by their mothers. Their mothers think they look about right for their age, whereas we might simply underestimate their age and think they look a few years younger than they are. Many of these children were born low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) because they did not receive sufficient nutrients in utero. Many continued to receive insufficient breast milk, if their mothers did not exclusively breast feed for 6 months. However, the major source of malnutrition is insufficient and low-quality food after 6 months of age, especially between 6 and 24 months when children need energy foods and micronutrients such as zinc and vitamin A (Black et al. 2008) . Bouts of diarrhea and respiratory illness leave young children further weakened because foods were withheld during illness or not added during recovery. Malnutrition is, therefore, a problem that requires coordinated research by psychologists, nutritionists, and agricultural experts (WHO, 2003) .",

Iodine and iron are essential nutrients for cognitive and language development. Even breast milk with its long-chain fatty acids allows for better brain development.

The relation between stunting and poor development is so strong that they decided to include all stunted children in this group -30% of less than 5 years. To that they added children who were not stunted but lived in extreme poverty, i.e., they lived on less than US$1 per day. Only half of these poor children were stunted. Including the other half raised the numbers with poor development to 40%. Their inability to reach their developmental potential is largely determined by malnutrition and inadequate stimulation, which in turns leads to poor school achievement, and early drop-out.

Research has shown that as obvious as these needs are not all children receive them in a responsive manner (Eshel et al. 2006) . Kangaroo care is the method for maintaining skin-to-skin contact between a mother and newborn to respond to needs for warmth.

Young children usually signal their need for stimulation by crying, waving, looking, smiling, and vocalizing; they also signal the desire for a reduction in stimulation by looking away. Children whose signals are answered learn to continue this kind of mutual communication which eventually becomes shared conversation. Children whose signals are not answered stop signaling but remain distressed. Although responsive stimulation and responsive language has been studied extensively in the USA, the American size does not fit all. Akhtar and Gernsbacher (2008) argue convincingly that the distal form of communication studied in middle class families, namely looking (\"gaze\") is uncommon in developing countries and even in the USA. This is because tactile stimulation is more common. Likewise others have shown that the American context in which responsive stimulation and language is studied, namely mother-child play, rarely occurs in developing countries (Vandermaas-Peeler 2002) . Play is seen as a child activity; adults are unlikely to play with child toys or is this necessary. So we need to select other contexts to study. One of these is reading or looking at pictures. The concept of dialogic reading, namely having a dyadic conversation about the story book, has been successfully exported from the USA and adapted to other countries. Even if mothers are illiterate, they may talk in a responsive manner with their child about pictures. It even works well when adapted to the preschool setting where the teacher can generate a responsive discussion with a group of children as he/she reads the story.",

A new field of responsive complementary feeding is documenting the lack of responsive feeding in many countries around the world. This leads to malnutrition in developing countries. Surprisingly, we see that the same problem leads to obesity in the USA. The underlying theme might be that children stop noticing their bodily cues of hunger and satiety if caregivers feed them in an unresponsive manner. It is not that the child's body tells it exactly what to eat and how much, but good eating habits should start early and require mother-child coordination. In some countries, mothers are highly controlling and insist on feeding quickly and forcefully without consideration of the child's slower pace and desire to self-feed. These mothers may encounter frequent refusals despite the malnourished state of the child (e.g., Aboud et al. 2008) . In other countries, mothers are uninvolved and let children fend for themselves, or are permissive and give children whatever they demand. None of these styles is responsive. This research sheds light on the style of feeding, which in combination with the quality of foods, can lead to malnutrition or obesity.",

School feeding was common in the USA during the 1930s depression and is still common in poor districts. It is now sponsored by the World Food Program in developing countries where some 18 million children receive a daily meal at school (http://www.wpf.org/food_aid/school_feeding). Education researchers examine whether it increases enrolment and attendance -it does. Nutritionists study the kinds of foods that will improve weight and height. Psychologists question whether students' benefit in terms of school achievement as well as broader social and cognitive skills. Studies in Jamaica, South Africa, and Kenya along with many others have now been conducted. In a nutshell, they tell us that animal source foods, such as meat or fish, have a stronger impact than a vegetable-based meal, and the impact is greatest on arithmetic and nonverbal analytic reasoning skills (Neumann et al. 2007 ). Meat also results in students who are more active, take leadership roles, and initiate peer interactions. Furthermore, the impact on mental outcomes is greatest for younger children in the early school years. Finally, in line with the theme of this section, the impact is greater if food is combined with a stimulating educational program.",

However, the effects of responsive feeding behavior and food on children's long-term development are still being explored. More needs to be done to examine how nutrition and stimulation combine to promote all aspects of health -physical, mental, and social -in the preschool and school years. Nutrition and education are also important for maternal health. But future research here needs to examine how to change delivery practices and their effects on mothers' and newborns' survival. Similarly, ongoing research is examining ways to change other health behaviors and sustain these behaviors. In particular, behaviors that prevent debilitating diseases are at the forefront of international research. American researchers from many disciplines are contributing to these exciting new developments, bringing ideas from the USA to developing countries and returning with strategies to improve our own lives.",
