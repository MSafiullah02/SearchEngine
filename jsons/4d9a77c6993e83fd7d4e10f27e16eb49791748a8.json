It takes into account that the growth in the number of infected individuals increases the initial viral load and provides a passage from the first stage of epidemic where only people with weak immune response are infected to the second stage where people with strong immune response are also infected.

Dynamics of the number of infected individuals can be influenced by various factors, in particular, by their spatial distribution and nature of social mixing. Appearance of new focuses of infection can essentially change the growth curves. For example, at the whole world level, development of the epidemic in Europe started when it was mostly at decaying mode in Asia. Instead of the standard growth-decay curves, this leads to growth-decaygrowth curves.

In the beginning of epidemic, the growth rate is exponential. At the next stage it continues to grow exponentially but with an increased growth rate. It can be considered as two different exponential functions where the second one has a larger exponent than the previous one. A possible explanation of this effect is related to the presence of sub-populations with different response on the infection. Simplifying the situation, we can consider two sub-populations, one of them with a weak immune response and another one with a strong immune response. The strength of immune response is determined by the rate of production of antigen specific immune cells. We will define it below. At the beginning of epidemic, infection propagates among the first subpopulation. When the epidemic reaches certain level, the second sub-population becomes also involved increasing the number of susceptible individuals.",

Taking into account that the disease duration is about one week, then we get an estimate of the number of simultaneously infected individuals. The situation is different for the coronavirus infection because the disease duration is longer (about 4 weeks) and because the patients with manifested symptoms are put in quarantine. Therefore, we need to take into account here only the latently infected individuals during the incubation period.

The second term characterizes virus death due to the immune response. This term is proportional to the virus density and to the density of immune cells c. The first term in the right-hand side of equation(3.2) describes multiplication of immune cells and the second term their mortality. In general, both of them depend on virus concentration. Clonal expansion of immune cells is stimulated by antigen (virus) if its concentration is not very large. For large virus concentration, the proliferation rate of immune cells can decrease. Therefore, the function p(v) is non-negative and increasing with saturation or growing for small v and decreasing for large v. The death rate of immune cells can also depend on the concentration of viruses. In this case it is a positive increasing function. It can be also considered as constant if this effect is negligible.

The trajectory with the initial condition (v 0 , c 0 ) and sufficiently small viral load v 0 can go either to the stationary point with complete virus elimination (right) or to a weak persistent infection (left). If the initial viral load is sufficiently large, then the trajectory approaches the stationary point with large v and small c. It corresponds to a strong chronic infection or to death. Reprinted from[2].observe that if the initial viral load v 0 is sufficiently small, then the trajectory approaches the stationary point with complete curing(Figure 2, right) or with a weak persistent infection (Figure 2, left). If the initial viral load is large enough, then the solution converges to a stationary point with a large virus concentration and low concentration of immune cells. It can characterize a strong chronic infection or a lethal outcome. We present some results of numerical simulations in Appendix 2.In order to get an explicit solution, we simplify system (3.1), (3.2) with the following assumptions:(A1) -functions p(v) and h(v) are constant. This means that the clonal reproduction of immune cells fully responds to the antigen as soon as there is a small amount of virus in the organism, and mortality rate of the immune cells does not depend on virus concentration;(A2) -there is no limitation on the production of viruses and immune cells by available resources, i.e., the logistic terms in equations (3.1), (3.2) are replaced by the linear terms.Under these assumptions, instead of system (3.1), (3.2) we consider the following system of equations:dv dt = kv \u2212 \u03c3cv, (3.3) dc dt = pc \u2212 hc.(3.4) We find from equation (3.4), c = c 0 e \u00b5t , where c 0 is the number of antigen specific immune cells initially, and \u00b5 = p \u2212 h. Assuming that \u00b5 > 0, we obtain exponential growth of immune cells. Substituting the solution for c into equation (3.3), we find the solution for v as v(t) = v 0 e kt\u2212 c 0 \u03c3 \u00b5 (e \u00b5t \u22121) , where v 0 is the initial viral load. The derivative of this function v \u2032 (t) = v 0 k \u2212 c 0 \u03c3e \u00b5t e kt\u2212 c 0 \u03c3 \u00b5 (e \u00b5t \u22121) is positive at t = 0 since the initial number c 0 of antigen specific cells is very small. Therefore, v(t) grows at the beginning of infection development. This derivative equals 0 at time t * = 1 \u00b5 ln k c 0 \u03c3 when the maximal virus concentration is reached. After that, it decreases and converges to 0. The maximal virus concentration is as follows: v * = v 0 e (w ln w\u2212w+1)/s , where w = k/(c 0 \u03c3), s = (p \u2212 h)/(c 0 \u03c3). Parameter w corresponds to the dimensionless virus multiplication rate. It characterizes the virulence of infection. Parameter s characterizes the strength of the immune response.",
