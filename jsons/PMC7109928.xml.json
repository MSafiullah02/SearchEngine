Numerous studies involving challenges with pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Pasteurella multocida), viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus, white spot syndrome virus), or protozoa (Cryptosporidium parvum) demonstrated reduced mortality and morbidity when feeding spray-dried bovine or porcine plasma to various animal species, indicating that plasma supplements can be considered as an alternative to the use of antibiotics (Quigley and Drew, 2000; Bikker et al., 2004; Campbell et al., 2004; Torrallardona et al., 2007).",

A protein fraction isolated from bovine plasma containing approximately 50% IgG consumed orally has been shown to improve viral gastroenteritis in children (Guarino et al., 1994) and has been used in the treatment of diarrhea in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients infected with C. parvum (Greenberg and Cello, 1996). It has been speculated that IgG is responsible for the SDP effect (van Djik et al., 2001). However, over 250 peptides have been identified in human plasma (Anderson and Anderson, 2002). Many proteins in SDP were shown to retain biological function after spray drying (Borg et al., 2002). Although it is logical that IgG contributes to the effects of SDP, it is also likely that many of the other plasma compounds also contribute to the various responses that have been attributed to the oral consumption of SDP.",

The model is based on the systemic administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), an enterotoxin that activates the mucosal immune system affecting both organized and diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B also increases mucosal permeability, increases luminal water secretion, and reduces the absorption of glucose across the small intestine. Our main interest was to better understand the mechanism of action of SDP at the mucosal level and potential modulation of the intestinal inflammatory responses. A second objective was to compare the effects of SDP with a full plasma protein fraction (PPF) isolated from plasma containing approximately 50% IgG (plasma with fibrin and albumin mostly removed).",

The innate immune system acts as a first line of defense by preventing the entry of infectious agents or by eliminating invading pathogens. It comprises physical barriers (e.g., skin or mucous membranes), cells in blood and tissues (e.g., phagocytes and natural killer cells), and soluble mediators (e.g., complement proteins and cytokines). While protection by innate immunity is effective, some pathogens have developed the ability to escape detection or clearance by this system, leading to the activation of the acquired immune system. This system consists of 2 major cell types, the T- and B-lymphocytes, which enable the specific recognition of and response to invaders. The T-lymphocytes mediate mainly cellular acquired immunity, whereas B lymphocytes are involved in humoral acquired immunity (Janeway, 2001).",

Gut-associated lymphoid tissue accounts for up to 80% of the mucosal immune system and is distributed throughout the intestine as organized entities, including Peyer's patches, isolated follicles, and mesenteric lymph nodes, or as diffuse GALT consisting of lymphocytes scattered along the epithelium and the lamina propria (Granger et al., 2006).

Addition of SDP to the diet did not modify the SEB-induced effects on neutrophil infiltration, but reduced eosinophil infiltration and the degree of degranulation (Figure 1).

Mucosal permeability mainly depends on the capacity of tight junctions to efficiently seal the apical poles of epithelial cells. The space between cells is occupied by interlocking proteins, called claudins, that bind scaffolding proteins, such as ZO-1, which in turn link them to the cellular cytoskeleton (Barrett, 2008).

Both cytokines increase epithelial permeability by reducing the expression of ZO-1 and occludin (Tsukita et al., 2002; Bruewer et al., 2003).

To this end, we measured the transmural flux of tracers and the expression of tight junction proteins that are known to control paracellular permeability. Two tracers were utilized, fluorescein isothiocyanate-Dextran (FD, 4 kD) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with a molecular mass of 40 kD, similar to those of many antigenic food proteins.",

Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B also enhanced the HRP movement across the mucosa, and the supplements showed a tendency to prevent this effect. However, there was a significant positive correlation between FD and HRP flux values, indicating that the paracellular route contributes to increased protein translocation across the intestine in animals challenged with the enterotoxin. Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B reduced the expression of ZO-1 and \u03b2-catenin, and both proteins tended to be negatively correlated with FD flux, indicating that the increases in dextran flux are paralleled by reductions in ZO-1 and \u03b2-catenin expression at the epithelial level (Figure 5). These results indicate that the increase in FD flux induced by SEB treatment is associated with a reduction in the tightness of the epithelial junction complex and that both dietary supplements resulted in some recovery (Figure 5). The effects of SEB were similar to those described in SEB-injected mice (Lu et al., 1998). The effects of SDP and PPF supplementation on reducing toxin-induced increase in mucosal permeability may prevent the passage of microbial and food antigens to the interstitial space, thereby blocking local inflammation (Santos et al., 2001).",

            "text": "In farm animals, enteric infections may cause intestinal inflammation, villous atrophy, and malabsorption that contribute to high rates of mortality (van Dijk et al., 2002). The effects of intestinal inflammation on nutrient absorption have been studied in different animal models. In neonatal rats, C. parvum infection does not affect peptide transport (Marquet et al., 2007) but disrupts AA absorption, leading to undernutrition and growth reduction that is not restored by spontaneous clearance of the parasite (Topouchian et al., 2001). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibits intestinal absorption of D-galactose via a complex cellular mechanism that could involve posttranscriptional regulation of the brush-border Na+-coupled glucose and galactose transporter [SGLT1 (Amador et al., 2007)]. Lipopolysaccharide also reduces the expression of mucosal glucose transporter 5, the brush-border specific fructose transporter, by a mechanism involving TNF-\u03b1 (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2008). Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibits D-fructose uptake in rabbit intestine (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2004), whereas IFN-\u03b3 downregulates D-glucose transport in T84 cells (Yoo et al., 2000). These results support the view that cytokines produced during inflammatory processes are involved in control of expression of nutrient transport proteins.",

This effect was attributed to a reduction in the expression of D-glucose transporters in the brush border membrane, as indicated by the decreased Vmax (the maximal transport capacity kinetic constant). This observation was supported by results from immunohistochemical analysis of SGLT1. Consistent with Ferraris et al. (1990), immune staining of SGLT1 showed that the protein is present in absorptive epithelial cells along the crypt-villous axis, with greater expression in the upper villous region than in the mid and basal regions (Figure 6). Therefore, it was concluded that the changes in D-glucose transport kinetics observed in rats challenged with SEB were due to specific effects on the function of SGLT1. In rats challenged with SEB, SDP increased SGLT1 maximal transport capacity. The effect of PPF was intermediate. This effect of SDP on SGLT1 expression was further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Garriga et al., 2005).",

If we assume that during interdigestive periods, typical luminal D-glucose concentration values are around 0.2 mmol/L (Ferraris et al., 1990), it can be calculated that SDP will increase the intestinal capacity to absorb D-glucose by 8 to 9%.

Food proteins and products from commensal bacteria can be taken up by M cells present in Peyer's patches, by dendritic cells (DC) of the lamina propria, or by transcytosis (especially at early stages of development). Antigens are then presented to naive CD4 T cells and activated. Activated lymphocytes produce proinflammatory cytokines that amplify the immune response and induce inflammatory cell recruitment. In an inflammatory state, immune cells release reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eliminate invaded pathogens; however, these agents also induced gut alterations and tissue destruction. Plasma protein supplementation can modulate the immune response at luminal level (e.g., modifying the microbiota profile, pathogen binding); biologically active compounds present in plasma supplements can also interact directly with mucosal immune cells. The plasma-induced changes in mucosal cytokine profile will prevent or reverse deleterious effects resulting from immune system activation.
