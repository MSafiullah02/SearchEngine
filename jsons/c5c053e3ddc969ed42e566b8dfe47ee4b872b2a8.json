            "text": "Word embeddings, made widely popular in 2013 with the release of word2vec, have become a mainstay of NLP engineering pipelines. Recently, with the release of BERT, word embeddings have moved from the term-based embedding space to the contextual embedding space-each term is no longer represented by a single lowdimensional vector but instead each term and its context determine the vector weights. BERT's setup and architecture have been shown to be general enough to be applicable to many natural language tasks. Importantly for Information Retrieval (IR), in contrast to prior deep learning solutions to IR problems which required significant tuning of neural net architectures and training regimes, \"vanilla BERT\" has been shown to outperform existing retrieval algorithms by a wide margin, including on tasks and corpora that have long resisted retrieval effectiveness gains over traditional IR baselines (such as Robust04). In this paper, we employ the recently proposed axiomatic dataset analysis technique-that is, we create diagnostic datasets that each fulfil a retrieval heuristic (both term matching and semantic-based)-to explore what BERT is able to learn. In contrast to our expectations, we find BERT, when applied to a recently released large-scale web corpus with ad-hoc topics, to not adhere to any of the explored axioms. At the same time, BERT outperforms the traditional query likelihood retrieval model by 40%. This means that the axiomatic approach to IR (and its extension of diagnostic datasets created for retrieval heuristics) may in its current form not be applicable to large-scale corpora. Additional-different-axioms are needed.",

Each dataset contains query-documents instances (most often, a query and two documents) that the investigated model should rank in the correct order as determined by the heuristic. The extent to which a model correctly ranks those instances is allowing us to gain insights into what type of information the retrieval model pays attention to (or not) when ranking documents.

It is an analytic technique to explore retrieval models and how best to improve them. In their seminal work, Fang et al. [9, 10] introduced a number of term-matching based heuristics that models should follow in order to be successful in retrieval tasks. Subsequently, Fang et al. [11] proposed a set of axioms based on semantic matching and thus allowing non-exact matches to be accounted for in axiomatic retrieval. We apply these axioms in our workalbeit in a slightly adapted manner. Other applications for axioms in IR include document re-ranking based on a Learning to Rank scenario [13] and query expansion [8] by exploring similar axioms. It should be noted, that-while sensible-it cannot be assumed that these axioms are a good fit for all kinds of corpora; they represent a general notion of how a good retrieval function should behave. Recently, Rennings et al. [25] introduced diagnostic datasets extracted from actual corpora that each fulfil one axiom. In contrast to the axiomatic approach, which requires an analytical evaluation of the retrieval functions under investigation, a diagnostic corpus enables us to analyse models' axiomatic performance that are too large to be analysed analytically (such as neural models with millions or even billions of parameters 5 ). Our work continues in that direction with a larger number of axioms (9 vs. 4) and the analysis of the current neural state-of-the-art (i.e., BERT).",

In contrast, in IR the central notion is relevance and although we know that it can be decomposed into various types (topical, situational, etc.) of relevance [29] , we have no easy way of creating datasets for each of these-it remains a time-intensive and expensive task. This also explains why corpora such as Robust04 remain useful and in use for such a long time. Instead, like Rennings et al. [25] we turn to the axiomatic approach to IR and create diagnostic datasets-one for each of our chosen retrieval heuristics. It has been shown that, generally, retrieval functions that fulfil these heuristics achieve a greater effectiveness than those that do not. In contrast to [25] which restricted itself to four term matching axioms, we explore a wider range of axioms, covering term frequency, document length, lower-bounding term frequency, semantic term matching and term proximity constraints. In total, we explore 9 axioms, all of which are listed in Table 1 with a short informal description of their main assumption of what a sensible retrieval function should fulfil. We note that this covers most of the term-matching and semantic-matching axioms that have been proposed. We have eliminated a small number from our work as we do not consider them relevant to BERT (e.g., those designed for pseudo-relevance feedback [5] ).",

Despite this lack of axiomatic fulfilment, BERT clearly outperforms QL, indicating that the existing axioms are not suitable to analyse BERT. The reverse ranking BERT proposes for nearly all of the LNC2 instances can be explained by the way the axiom is phrased. It is designed to avoid over penalising documents, and thus a duplicated document should always have a retrieval score that is not lower than the original document. The opposite argument though could be made too (and BERT ranks accordingly), that a duplicated document should not yield a higher score than the original document as it does not contain novel/additional information. As we did not provide LNC2 instances in the training set, BERT is not able to rank according to the axiom, in line with the findings of other neural approaches as shown by Rennings et al. [25] .",

For instance, one may expect that BERT would fare quite well on STMC1, given its semantic nature. However, our results indicate that BERT is actually considers term matching as one of its key features. In order to further explore this tension between semantic and syntactic term matching, we split the queries in our test set by their term overlap between the query and the relevant document (if several relevant documents exist for a query, we randomly picked one of them). If a query/document has no (or little) term overlap, we consider this as a semantic match. The results of this query split can be found in Fig. 1 . We split the query set roughly into three equally sized parts based on the fraction of query terms appearing in the relevant document (as an example, if a query/document pair has a fraction of 0.5, half of all query terms appear in the document). We report results for all queries (Fig. 1 (left) ), as well as only those where the relevant document appears in the top-100 QL ranking ( Fig. 1 (right) ). We find that BERT outperforms QL across all three splits, indicating that BERT is indeed able to pick up the importance of syntactic term matching. At the same time, as expected, BERT is performing significantly better than QL for queries that require a large amount of semantic matching. That brings into question on why, then, the axiomatic performance across our semantic axiomatic datasets does not reflect that. One hypothesis is that the semantic similarity we measure (based on context-free word embeddings) is different to the semantic similarity measured via contextual word embeddings. This in itself is an interesting avenue for future work, since it brings a new question on what that semantic relationship is, and how to accurately measure it. Fig. 1 . The test queries are split into three sets, depending on the fraction of term overlap between the query and its corresponding relevant document. On the left, we plot all queries, on the right only those queries for which the relevant document appears in the top-100 ranked documents of the QL ranking.",

We expected BERT to perform better at fulfilling some of the proposed semantic axioms. Instead, we have shown that BERT, while significantly better than traditional models for ad-hoc retrieval, does not fulfil most retrieval heuristics, created by IR experts, that are supposed to produce better results for ad-hoc retrieval models. We argue that based on these results, the axioms are not suitable to analyse BERT and it is an open question what type of axioms would be able to capture some performance aspects of BERT and related models. In fact, how to arrive at those additional axioms, based on the knowledge we have now gained about BERT is in itself an open question.",
