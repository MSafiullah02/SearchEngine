The xTAG showed the best sensitivity to common viral targets when compared to the ResPlex II and MultiCode-PLx assays. Previous studies have shown MultiCode-PLx to be highly sensitive in detecting FluA and other viral targets.7, 8 In our study, the MultiCode-PLx detected some FluA's, FluB's and Adeno that were missed by culture. However, it missed 3 FluA's, 2 HRV's, and 2 RSVA's detected by the other PRV assays (Table 1). Additionally, we encountered specimens that were positive for Para3 and 4 that were not confirmed by the ResPlex II, xTAG or by culture (data not shown). This may reflect low primer specificity for these agents. While the ResPlex II has been shown to have good correlation with DFA cross reactivity between Para1, 3 and 4 have been reported.25 Internal control failures were noted with the ResPlex II as previously described25, but were minimal with xTAG or MultiCode-PLx assays. Compared to culture, it was as sensitive as the MultiCode-PLx, but showed higher specificity (Table 2). While parainfluenza cross reactivity was not observed, the ResPlex II did not detect some Para3's and RSVA's. When compared to the xTAG, the ResPlex II showed lower sensitivity than MultiCode-PLx. However, it depicted higher specificity (Table 3). Overall, the xTAG showed the highest reproducibility with sensitivities and specificities comparable to values reported in the product insert.19 In the specimens studied, we detected adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. However, a more extensive evaluation of adenovirus serotypes is warranted due to lack of detection of all serotypes as per the product insert.19 We detected a low rate of co-infections compared to previous studies. However the relative contribution of each potential pathogen is not clear at this time.26\n",

The assay complexity impacts turnaround time, influencing patient management. The ResPlex II generates results in 5.5 h, it is easy to perform, and only has one reagent preparation step and amplification step. Bead hybridization, detection, and reporting of results were the second step and they were performed in quick succession. On the other hand, the xTAG was the most labor intensive (7\u20138 h) due to five distinctive reagent preparations steps, two different thermocycler programs, and the complexity of the enzymes and reagents. While the xTAG and ResPlex II required only one thermocycler, the MultiCode-PLx required two thermocyclers, one for the reverse-transcriptase and the other for the Target-Specific-Primer-Extension that are performed in separate areas. In the MultiCode-PLx all post-amplification steps are carried out at room temperature without transfer or washings, and are completed in about 4\u20134.5 h. A drawback of these PRV assays is that they are open platforms and potentially prone to contamination.",

While the ResPlex II test offers the broadest range of virus detection, and the MultiCode-PLx the greatest ease of use, the xTAG showed increased sensitivity and had the ability to subtype Influenza A. New generation assays promise enhanced sensitivity, faster turn around time, and additional viral and bacterial targets.9, 31 These multiplex assays should assist in identifying respiratory virus infections, aiding in patient management and investigation of outbreaks.",
