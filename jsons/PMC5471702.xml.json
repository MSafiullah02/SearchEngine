            "text": "For a considerable period of time, investigators have been reporting on the occurrence of cardiac events in patients with acute respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1, 2]. Among these cardiac events are acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial infarction [AMI]), acute or worsening cardiac arrhythmias and new or worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) [2]. The features of the association between acute coronary events and arrhythmias and CAP appear to fulfill the criteria for causality\u2014namely, that pneumonia is a cause of these events; whereas, in the case of CHF, it appears the cause\u2013effect relationship may be bidirectional [2]. More recent studies are beginning to give insight into the magnitude of this problem, also indicating that these events tend to be particularly common early on during the course of CAP, and also tend to be more common in patients with certain risk factors, including older age, nursing home residence, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and in more severe pneumonia [2]. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that in up to 50 % of cases with CAP in which acute cardiac complications occur, there has been no prior history of overt chronic cardiac disease [3].",

Furthermore, cardiovascular events (CVEs) are recognised to be the primary causes of clinical failure in patients with CAP and should be actively looked for in patients not responding to standard medical care [6]. Importantly, it is now recognised that acute cardiac events occurring during the course of CAP are associated with negative impacts on both short-term and long-term outcomes [2, 6]. This article will review the clinical studies of cardiac events in patients with CAP, describe the likely pathogenic mechanisms involved in this interaction, and discuss possible therapeutic and preventative strategies to manage these events, particularly in pneumococcal CAP.",

They noted that there was an increased risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.2; p < 0.02) of the occurrence of minor acute respiratory symptoms in the patients with AMI compared with the controls, and suggested that further investigations should be undertaken to determine if there was a pathogenic relationship between acute respiratory symptoms, considered likely to be of viral origin, and the onset of AMI. Over many subsequent years, the association between acute infections, most commonly respiratory infections, but also Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, urinary tract infections and gastroenteritis, and the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes has been documented [1].",

The authors prospectively studied consecutive patients with CAP who had no prior or underlying cardiorespiratory illnesses. In addition to recording demographic, clinical, microbiological, laboratory, and outcome data, they also performed electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic investigations and measured serum enzyme, including cardiac enzyme levels (creatinine kinase [CK], CK-MB fraction, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]). A number of ECG changes were documented, which returned to normal after a mean of 2 days in survivors. The so-called S1, Q3, T3 pattern on ECG was associated with CK-MB leak, hypoxia and a high Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS). The presence of P pulmonale, right axis deviation and clockwise rotation correlated with hypoxia and high SAPS score. Clockwise rotation also correlated with raised serum LDH and CK-MB levels and high pulmonary artery pressures. The overall patient mortality was 10.8 % and a number of negative prognostic factors were documented. While there was no association between the ECG changes and mortality, raised LDH, CK and CK-MB levels correlated, among other factors, with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality.",

The case fatality rate was significantly higher in patients who had an acute cardiac event (19.4 %) than in patients who did not have such an event (6.4 %; p < 0.001).

            "text": "More recently, a number of investigators have studied long-term cardiovascular complications of CAP [18\u201321]. In one investigation adult patients with CAP initially hospitalised in a tertiary hospital were followed up for 1 year, post-discharge [18]. Overall, 93/1,284 (7.2 %) patients died within 1 year of hospital discharge (68 [73.1 %] in the first 6 months). The main reasons for mortality were infectious diseases, mainly pneumonia, and acute CVEs. A number of risk factors were noted, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cancer, and dementia, which could help identify cases at high risk of long-term mortality. Another study documented cardiac complications (sometimes more than one) in 55/310 (18 %) hospitalised CAP patients, which included AMI or a new episode of atrial fibrillation in 32 and 30 patients, respectively [19]. However, during the follow-up, 89 patients died (51 % of whom had experienced an in-hospital cardiac complication, versus 26 % who had not; p < 0.001); in addition, 73 had a CVE (47 % of patients who had experienced an in-hospital cardiac event, versus 19 % who had not; p < 0.001). Among other factors, in-hospital cardiac events were significantly associated with both overall mortality and CVEs during follow-up. A third study in elderly patients with CAP (\u226565 years) [20] documented the occurrence of new onset of heart failure in both the intermediate and long-term (even after 5 years) following hospitalisation, which had not been present on hospital admission. These same authors confirmed in an additional study [21] that hospitalisation for CAP is associated with both short-term and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and while the risk of cardiovascular disease was greatest in the first year following hospitalisation, it remained higher than in controls for up to 10 years of follow-up.",

[25] undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to document the incidence of major cardiac complications within 30 days in patients diagnosed with CAP in order to determine the magnitude of the problem. Among the 17 articles (68 %) that had reported on in-patient cohorts of CAP, data extracted from appropriate studies indicated that incidence rate of overall cardiac complications was 17.7 %, heart failure was 14.1 % (range 7\u201333 %), acute coronary syndromes was 5.3 % (range 1\u201311 %) and cardiac arrhythmias was 4.7 % (range 1-\u201311 %). Major conclusions from this analysis were that cardiac complications were common in patients with CAP and needed to be better appreciated by physicians and patients alike, with early recognition and appropriate management. Furthermore, the investigators indicated the need for a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, of risk factors, and of the impact of these cardiac events on patient outcome. In addition, as indicated by these and other investigators, there needs to be a better understanding of interventions to treat these complications (e.g. with the use of cardioprotective medications), as well as to prevent them (e.g. with use of influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccination) [26]. Possible therapeutic and preventative strategies, preceded by a brief overview of current concepts in pathogenesis including the role of pneumolysin in CAP-associated CVEs, are discussed in more detail below.",

Notwithstanding disease severity and heart ejection fraction, significant predictors of myocardial infarction included elevated concentrations of the circulating biomarkers of platelet activation, soluble CD40 ligand, P-selectin (CD62P) and thromboxane B2 (a surrogate for thromboxane A2), as well as the mean platelet volume [28].

These, in turn, interact with and activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other types of pathogen-recognition receptors that are expressed on platelets [29, 30, 36].

Brown et al. [45] have reported that experimental invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in mice and rhesus macaques was associated with myocardial damage and formation of cardiac microlesions. Translocation of the pneumococcus into the myocardium appeared to be dependent on the pneumococcal adhesins, choline-binding protein A and phosphorylcholine, while microlesion formation was mediated by pneumolysin [45]. Similar microlesions were detected in cardiac sections from patients with fatal IPD [45].

The authors, who also used a murine model of IPD, observed that infection with pneumolysin-expressing pneumococci, but not with strains deficient in the toxin, resulted in significant elevations in circulating cardiac troponins and myocardial injury [46]. These injurious effects on the myocardium were mimicked by intravenous administration of recombinant pneumolysin, but not by a mutant toxin devoid of pore-forming activity, and were attenuated by co-administration of pneumolysin-sequestering liposomes [46]. Mechanistically, exposure of murine cardiomyocytes to sublytic concentrations of the toxin resulted in intense calcium influx and overload followed by membrane depolarisation [46], as previously reported for human neutrophils [47]. These disruptive effects of the toxin on cardiomyocytes were associated with a \u201cprogressive reduction in intracellular calcium transient amplitude, a key determinant of contractile force\u201d [46].",

During the follow-up period, 16.2 % of patients died: 19/390 (4.9 %) in the group of aspirin-users and 144/615 (23.4 %; p < 0.001) in the group of non-users, with a hazard ratio for total mortality of 2.07 (p = 0.029) [49].

These findings were not, however, confirmed in a large multicentre, international observational study (n = 3,855 patients) focused on the potential benefit of pre-hospitalisation administration of aspirin on development of ALI following hospital admission [54]. Although univariate analysis revealed a reduced incidence of ALI in patients receiving aspirin therapy (OR 0.65; p = 0.010), this protective effect was attenuated using propensity score analysis (OR 0.70; p = 0.072) [54]. Nonetheless, the authors conceded that prospective intervention trials were justified. In this context, a recently published study [55], albeit involving a relatively small number of patients with ARDS (n = 202) admitted to a single medical and surgical ICU over an 18-month period, is noteworthy.

In this context, it is noteworthy that a large case-control study documented a significant decrease of >50 % in the rate of myocardial infarction in recipients of PPV23, which was evident from 2 years and onwards following administration of the vaccine [70]. More recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies covering the period 2000\u20132013, which included 332,267 participants, concluded that administration of PPV23 conferred transient protection against both myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events [71].",

In another population-based cohort study of adults presenting with CAP, PPV23 immunisation was associated with a 58 % reduction in acute coronary syndrome events occurring within 90 days of pneumonia [73].

While a recent study [76] has documented significant protection against pneumococcal infection in the elderly with the use of PCV13, there have been no studies specifically addressing the impact of PCV13 immunisation on CVEs. However, given the increasing realisation of the probable involvement of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of CVEs secondary to pneumococcal CAP, the inclusion of an immunogenic pneumolysoid with PCV13 (or a similar polysaccharide conjugate vaccine) may offer maximal benefit [77].",
