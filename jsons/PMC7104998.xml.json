Although not the subject of this article, pulmonary embolus and cardiac causes are important differential diagnoses, but it is most commonly the increased awareness of the physiological hyperventilation of pregnancy which leads to a subjective feeling of breathlessness. Women most often present in the third trimester but may become symptomatic at any gestation. Classically physiological breathlessness of pregnancy is present at rest or while talking and paradoxically improves with activity. Table 1\nsummarises other causes. Other presenting symptoms of respiratory disease include chest pain, cough, sputum production, haemoptysis, fever or cyanosis.",

Delivery during a viraemic period is hazardous with maternal risks of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatitis. Supportive treatment and intravenous aciclovir may be necessary. There is a high risk of varicella transmission to the newborn with significant morbidity and mortality.

The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide is rising, in part due to the susceptibility to TB of HIV-infected patients, and in the UK is more prevalent amongst Asian and African immigrants. In pregnancy recent studies have suggested a high prevalence (50%) of extrapulmonary TB (at sites such as lymph nodes, bone, liver, spleen, bone marrow, caecum, nervous system and eye). The patient is often asymptomatic but typically can present with a cough, haemoptysis, weight loss and night sweats. The diagnosis is confirmed with sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain). Although pregnancy and TB have little effect on each other, treatment should not be delayed in pregnancy. Because of a rising incidence of drug-resistant TB, treatment is often with prolonged courses of multiple chemotherapeutic agents at the advice of the respiratory physicians. The usual drugs given are rifampicin (no proven adverse fetal effects but risk of maternal hepatotoxicity), isoniazid (in combination with pyridoxine 50 mg/day to reduce the risk of peripheral neuritis), pyrazinamide and/or ethambutol. Liver function should be monitored monthly. Streptomycin is associated with eighth nerve damage and should therefore be avoided. After delivery the neonate should be given prophylactic isoniazid treatment if the mother is sputum positive. The infant should also be vaccinated as soon as possible. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated since very little of the drugs are excreted in breast milk.",

            "text": "Breathlessness in the absence of an underlying pathology is common in pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. The use of chest X-rays when underlying disease is suspected should not be avoided in pregnancy and most drugs can be used safely in pregnancy. It is important that women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education regarding the risks of pregnancy and the importance of continuing their medications. It also provides the opportunity to optimise their condition and so reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with regular review by chest physicians and access to chest physiotherapy if necessary. Liaison with obstetric anaesthetists in the antenatal period will optimise care at delivery with regard to pain relief and reduce anaesthetic risks. Respiratory diseases complicated by pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale have a poor prognosis in pregnancy. \n\u25c6\nPractice pointsAsthma\u2022Counsel women with asthma to continue their medication in pregnancy\u2022PEFR and FEV1 are unaffected by pregnancy\u2022Inhaled and nebulised \u03b2\n2-agonists, inhaled and oral steroids, oral and intravenous theophyllines, and intravenous magnesium sulphate are safe in pregnancy and may be used as in the non-pregnant patient\nRespiratory tract infections\u2022Pneumonia in pregnancy is often more virulent and therefore should be treated aggressively\u2022All non-immune pregnant women exposed to varicella should be given zoster immunoglobulin (ZIG) as soon as possible\u2022Clinical varicella should be treated with aciclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation\u2022Risk of TB should be assessed at booking, especially in immigrant women\nCystic fibrosis\u2022Joint care with a CF centre is required\u2022Specialist dietary advice and nutritional supplements should be given, ideally pre-pregnancy\u2022Infective exacerbations should be treated aggressively\u2022Prolonged pushing in the second stage of labour should be avoided\n\n",
