An egregious example has been guidance issued and actively promoted by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [1], which was carried by leading news outlets [2] that led to at least almost 600 stories in the past month [3]. A social media video in Italy conveyed that contact lenses are not safe to wear and that certain contact lens materials are \u201criskier\u201d than others. The guidance to stop contact lens wear has even extended into an article on Do-It-Yourself (DIY) injuries during the coronavirus lockdown [4].",

An evidence-based approach in healthcare is essential in providing the best outcomes, and it can be dangerous to not rely on or even consider what research shows in the management of patients [5,6]. Even when confronted with updated guidance on contact lens wear and care from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [7], i.e., there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers, and that contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe lens wear and care hygiene habits, imperious guidance to stop contact lens wear has continued. A clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology was quoted in an interview [8] as saying, \u201cThe CDC is staffed by epidemiologists. They are looking at published data; what is known about this new virus.\u201d But the fact is, there\u2019s not a lot known about COVID-19 and its behavior in the eye.\" The spokesperson\u2014who is a practicing ophthalmologist\u2014then went on to say, \"Ophthalmologists are physicians, we look at it a little differently. We look at what is known about other viruses and how they can be transmitted through tears asymptomatically. We also know that most patients don\u2019t follow proper contact lens hygiene. Add that together with\na dose of common sense (emphasis added), and we err on the side of caution, and suggest patients consider taking a break from contact lenses for a while.\u201d\n",

It is certainly delivering bad news\u2014an attention-grabbing shock\u2014when someone hears or reads that they can no longer wear contact lenses, especially if they rely on their lenses for clear vision and enjoy the freedom and convenience of wearing lenses.

These resources can also be used to reinforce the importance of good hand washing and drying habits along with good contact lens case hygiene if patients are wearing reusable lenses. Recent expedited, peer review publications [13,14], that have been thoroughly researched and referenced, have provided the foundation for much of the guidance on safe contact lens wear and care. Although these resources are too numerous to list all of them, amongst the more notable to provide statements, information and links to additional resources have been the British Contact Lens Association [15], the American Academy of Optometry [16], the American Optometric Association [17], the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [7], and the Centre for Ocular Research & Education [18].",
