It is particularly critical that such operations build upon evidence-based, informed shared decision-making rationales among all parties comprising our healthcare delivery system.

In Korea, there is a tradition that family member(s) or a hired carer(s) stays with the patient while he or she is in the hospital. However, it was discovered that the practice made effective and efficient infection control impossible. The care tradition was one of the reasons behind the 38 fatalities (a lethality rate of 20.4%) caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2015 (Kim, 2015) , whereupon the inception of the Korean-CNCS began to emerge as the key solution.",

Four of five new nurses left their jobs because of the much heavier workloads caused by the Korean-CNCS (Chae, 2016) . In fact, the majority of newly hired nursing staff hold temporary positions (Kim, 2016) . Furthermore, the Korean-CNCS caused inequity in access to healthcare when urban hospitals absorbed the nurse staffing of local hospitals to get more government grants, which eventually led to the closure of the only emergency center in a certain rural area (Kim, 2017 ). Bohmer's (2016) report shows that financial incentives actually did not lead to real change. Increasing the quota of nursing school entrants was also fruitless in meeting the demand of nurse staffing in practice (Shin, 2017) . Ironically, in 2014 Korea produced the most nursing graduates per 100,000 inhabitants among all OECD countries, and even more than three times that of the UK (122 vs. 29) (OECD 2017b). A special law on the health workforce with strict regulations is now expected to be re-proposed to ensure patient safety (Seo, 2016) . However, will it be the best way to secure a sufficient nursing workforce to actually sustain the policy?",

This thoughtprovoking transition urges us to think \"outside the box\" toward incorporating a synthesis of technology and mathematical modeling into research, practice and policy-making. As the saying goes: \"There is nothing that is a more certain sign of insanity than to do the same thing over and over and expect the results to be different.\" This is also in line with what Hamming (1986) said at the Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar: \"What happens to the old fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on using it. They were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There's the new direction; but the old fellows are still marching in their former direction.",

Let me conclude by citing the most impressive part of Hamming's (1986) You and Your Research, which emphasizes a \"drive\"and 'commitment' to the important challenges of doing first-class science:Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can stepforward and create the new replacement theory. [. . .] It requires a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true, and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it. [. . .] When you find apparent flaws, you've got to be sensitive, and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them. Those are often the great contributions. Great contributions are rarely done by adding another decimal place. It comes down to an emotional commitment. Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem.",
