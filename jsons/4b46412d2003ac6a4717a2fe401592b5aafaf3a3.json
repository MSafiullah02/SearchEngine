The mean antibody levels determined by these two methods continued t o increase, however, up t o the age group of 10-14 years. This increase in antibody levels after the initial antibody incidence plateau may be due t o boosting effects caused by related coronavirus strains, since OC43 antigens are known t o cross-react with antibodies induced by other human coronaviruses.

In contrast, all of the more than 20 coronavirus strains isolated from man were in association with mild upper respiratory tract infections [Bradburne and Tyrrell, 19711 . Our present knowledge of the epidemiology and the real clinical significance of human coronaviruses may be superficial, however, due to technical difficulties in diagnosing coronavirus infections [Bradburne and Tyrrell, 19711 . Indeed, coronaviruses may also cause non-respiratory diseases in man, since they have recently been reported to be associated with nonbacterial gastroenteritis [Caul and Clarke, 19751 and endemic neohritis IAuostolov et al, 19751. Most seroepidemiologic studies on human coronavirus antibodies have been carried out using the OC43 virus strain [Bradbourne and Tyrell, 19711 as antigen. This strain has been adapted to grow in suckling mouse brain, where it readily produces haemagglutinin [Kaye and Dowdle, 19691. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies are thought to be relatively specific for the OC43 strain and surveys using the OC43 virus HI test suggest that this virus is a common agent in many countries [Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971 ; Kaye et al, 1971; Bradburne and Somerset, 1972; Zakstelskaya et al, 1972; Riski and Estola, 19741. Complement-fixing (CF) antigens produced by the OC43 virus in mouse brain, on the other hand, broadly cross-react with antibodies elicited by most other human coronavirus strains [Bradburne and Tyrrell, 19711 , suggesting that OC43 CF antigen may be suitable for use as a \"group-antigen'' in the general diagnosis of coronavirus infections. alence of OC43 virus strain-related antibodies in different age groups.

It is obvious that coronavirus infections are widespread in Finland, as essentially everyone older than 5 years had measurable antibodies against the OC43 virus antigen. In light of this, the complete lack of coronavirus antibodies in the 6to 23-month-olds was an unexpected finding. This observation may be explained by two different epidemiologic situations: Either children younger than 2 years do not contact coronavirus infections or, more likely, there has been very little coronavirus circulation in Finland during the last two years. If the latter is true, sera collected some years ago from children younger than 2 years (ie, from the age-mates of the 5-to 6-",

For instance, we found several sera with relatively high antibody levels against the 229E virus which did not react at all with OC43 virus antigen-coated balls and vice versa (unpublished results).
