PEDV causes a highly contagious enteric infection in swine (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978) and clinical signs include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, and dehydration. Morbidity and mortality in infected neonatal piglets <5 days of age approaches 95% because of the severe diarrhoea and dehydration. Histological lesions are characterised by villous atrophy and fusion in the jejunum and ileum (Kim and Chae, 2000). In the Republic of Korea, there has been high incidence of diarrhoea and death in neonatal piglets associated with PEDV infection and this has become a major economic concern (Chae et al., 2000).",

It was speculated that in some unknown way infection with PCV2 in utero might affect the outcome of PEDV infection in post-natal pigs. Moreover, dual infection with PEDV and PCV2 has also been reported in neonatal piglets (Hirai et al., 2001). The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of PCV2 DNA in fresh intestinal tissues by PCR and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded intestinal tissues by in situ hybridisation from pigs naturally infected with PEDV.",

The digoxigenin-labelled probe for PCV2 was prepared and in situ hybridisation was performed as previous described (Kim et al., 2003). The small intestinal tissues from three pigs which had been experimentally infected with PCV2 were used as positive controls and small intestinal tissues from eight uninfected pigs were used as negative controls (Kim et al., 2003).",

A total of 35 (32.7%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV was found to be positive for PCV2 by PCR. The five PCR products were randomly selected and sequenced. Their identities were confirmed as PCV2 (data not shown). Positive signals for PCV2 were detected in 32 (29.9%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV by in situ hybridisation. The distribution of positive cells in the jejunum and ileum was multifocal or patchy. Distinct positive labelling was found throughout the lamina propria of the small intestines (Fig. 1\n). Comparison with haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from the same block indicated that most of the positive cells had an oval nucleus and abundant cytoplasm resembling macrophages. No enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from intestinal tissues of the 107 pigs with PEDV infection (data not shown), although rotavirus antigen was detected in frozen intestinal tissues from two pigs with PEDV infection using an immunofluorescence antibody test (data not shown).",

Transplacental transmission with PCV2 has been also reported in gilts (Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al., 2001). PCV2 typically causes subclinical infections with most (if not all) farms worldwide having seropositive animals, whereas only a small number of pigs are seropositive to PMWS (Larochelle et al., 2003, Rose et al., 2003).",
