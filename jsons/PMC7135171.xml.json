The study confirmed that the EDs are severely overcrowded.\n2. What does this study attempt to show?This study aims to show that EDs are severely overcrowded in Beijing, and the reasons.\n3. What are the key findings?The ED settings in Beijing are different from other countries. The EDs actually assume the task of the clinic and thereby make EDs severely overcrowded. The main reasons are the large number of nonemergency patients visiting the ED and difficultly in admitting ED patients. Observation patients with end-stage disease and multiple organ failure stayed in the ED due to nursing home shortage.\n4. How is patient care impacted?Many patients were left in the ED as observation patients. These included patients who needed to be hospitalized but there was an inpatient bed shortage. Some emergency patients occupy the scarce health care resources at night; as a result, this situation increased the burden of the EDs to some extent. ED overcrowding causes delays in diagnosis, delays in treatment, decreased quality of care, and poor patient outcomes.\n\n",

Observation units with EW beds, created as a response to ED overcrowding, enable new, additional capacity within EDs to provide care for non-ICU patients who, for various reasons, cannot or will not be admitted promptly to hospital inpatient beds. Reasons for the inability to promptly admit these patients include not only access block, but also, refusals by inpatient doctors to accept certain patients for inpatient care. Inpatient admission refusals by inpatient physicians accrue in our system due to the perceived complexity required to provide that patient's inpatient care, or due to the patient's needs for long-term care.",
