            "text": "The primary sequence of a protein refers to an ordered string of amino acids that belong to a finite set. It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids, across all protein sequences, would appear to be fixed, given no mutations over a specific period of time. Of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein. However, when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another, specific patterns begin to emerge. These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases, similar functions between the proteins that contain them. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs, so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules [1], [2]. Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs, such as PROSITE, Pratt and EMOTIF, have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. All of these methods share one property, they depend on specific alignment algorithms, such as the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST or PSI-BLAST) to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed [5], [8]. These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein's primary sequence.",

            "text": "We use the symbol \u03a9 to denote the Swiss-Prot database, and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database (133,723). Hence we can state that \u03a9={As,s=1,2,\u2026,M} where As=(a1,1,a2,2,\u2026,as,Ns) is the sth protein, ai with i\u2208Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence, and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As. For any vector b(n), if there is a sequence As in \u03a9 such that b(n) is a segment of As, then we can say b(n) occurs in \u03a9. We can then use N\u03a9(b(n)) to denote the total number of outcomes that b(n) has occurred in \u03a9, and let N\u03a9(n) be the total number of all vectors occurring in \u03a9 with length n. Therefore,(2.3)p(b(n))=N\u03a9(b(n))N\u03a9(n)is the probability that the vector b(n) occurs in \u03a9. We then introduce(2.4)k(p,q;b(n))=log2p(b(n))q(b(n)),where p(b(n)) and q(b(n)) are any two probability distributions on Zq(n), and b(n) belongs to Zq(n). The quantity k(p,q;b(n)) in Eq. (2.4) is defined for any two probability distributions p(b(n)) and q(b(n)) on Zq(n) where the distribution q arises from independent letter (i.e., amino acid) probabilities. Then, k(p,q;b(n)) can be viewed as a random variable about b(n) and its probability distribution is defined as follows:(2.5)F(p,q)(x)=PI{k(p,q;b(n))\u2a7dx}=\u2211b(n):k(p,q,b(n))\u2a7dxp(b(n)).The expectation value \u03bc(p,q) and variance \u03c32(p,q) of p(b(n)) are expressed mathematically as(2.6)\u03bc(p,q)=\u2211b(n)\u2208Zq(n)p(b(n))k(p,q;b(n)),\n(2.7)\u03c32(p,q)=\u2211b(n)\u2208Zq(n)p(b(n))[k(p,q;b(n))-\u03bc(p,q)]2.Hence we see that \u03bc(p,q) is simply the Kullback\u2013Leibler entropy [14]. As a consequence, \u03bc(p,q) is always non-negative and \u03bc(p,q)=0 if and only if p(b(n))=q(b(n)). As a result, the amino acid sequence of b(n) can be represented by k(p,q;b(n)).",

For example, if we let p be the probability of b(n), and only change the value of q in k(p,q;b(n)), we obtain the following expression:(2.8)q(b(n))=\u220fj=1np(bj)=p(b1)p(b2)\u2026p(bn).Based on Eqs. (2.4) and (2.8), the value of k(p,q;b(n)) gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b(n). Here two situations are identified as especially interesting:(i)When k(p,q;b(n))\u2aa20 implies that among the amino acids in vector b(n), there is an increased affinity. That is, the vector b(n) occurs more frequently than expected.(ii)When k(p,q;b(n))\u2aa10 implies that among the amino acids in vector b(n) there is a decreased affinity. That is, the vector b(n) occurs less frequently than expected.In a similar approach to the condition described above, we may choose q(b(n))=p(\u03c0n(b(n))), where \u03c0n(b(n)) is a permutation of b(n), and \u03c0n denotes a permutation transform. In this case, the order sensitivity of b(n) can also be reflected by the value of k(p,q;b(n)) and produces the following outcomes:(i)when k(p,q;b(n))\u2aa20 implies that b(n) occurs much more often than \u03c0n(b(n));(ii)when k(p,q;b(n))\u2aa10 implies that \u03c0n(b(n)) occurs much more often than b(n).In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity, we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q(b(n)). Quantifying the terms k(p,q;b(n)), we can represent vector frequency numerically. In cases where k(p,q;b(n))-\u03bc(p,q)\u2a7e\u0394\u03c3(p,q) the corresponding vector b(n) is called \u0394-positive, while in those cases where the opposite takes place: k(p,q;b(n))-\u03bc(p,q)\u2a7d-\u0394\u03c3(p,q) the vector b(n) is called \u0394-negative. By judiciously choosing a \u0394 equal to 2, we obtained 16, two-residue, positive-pairs, and 8 two-residue negative-pairs (see Table 2\n) out of a total of 400 possibilities of amino acid pairs.",

The same also holds true for the CM pair, where we would expect to see 2159 CM pairs, but actually observe 5007 (Table 5\n).

This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss-Prot occurs randomly. However, we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach, putting q(CCM)=p(CC)p(M) into Eq. (2.4). If CCM occurs randomly, then we have p(CCM)=p(C)p(C)p(M), and since p(CC)>2\u03bc+2\u03c3p(C)p(C), we will get(3.6)k(p,q;CCM)=log2p(CCM)q(CCM)=log2p(C)2p(CC)\u2a7d-(\u03bc+2\u03c3)<0.Based on Eq.

While currently impossible to determine, one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual. If a person has been infected by SARS, we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual. If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein, without damaging the cell, it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined. If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells. As a very specific example, this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously [24], [25]. While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non-specific protein synthesis inhibitors, the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these.",

This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein's primary amino acid sequence. Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate. By analyzing affinity and anti-affinity, we developed a procedure to search out all two- and three-residue clusters within these databases. Through this technique, we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs. Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function, we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities. A timely example of the application of this method is given, namely the analysis of the SARS virus. This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases, by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence.",
