The proposed model takes an edge-centric perspective because the relevant dynamic equations are based on the set of edges. Furthermore, the framework integrates the complete temporal and topological information of the underlying network into the epidemic model. We refer to our approach as contact-based (CB) model and compare numerical predictions with the widely used IB model that takes a node-centric perspective. Within the CB framework, we then derive a new analytic expression of the epidemic threshold for temporal networks and show that the edge-centric approach improves existing results [7,20,43,44,52,53] at a low conceptual and numerical cost. The CB and IB models have been implemented in Python with the source code available on Github [57].",

However, if node l contracts a disease from a neighbor k with some probability and passes it on to another node k\u2032, then the corresponding probabilities Ik and Ik\u2032 are clearly correlated. A simple solution that allows different branches to nonetheless be treated as independent is to prevent a probability flow through the root node in the first place. From a graph-theoretic perspective, this solution corresponds to the (virtual) removal of all out-directed contacts from the root node. This approach does not modify the dynamics of the node under consideration because it can still contract the disease, and once infected, the recovery process is independent of the topology. However, the idea considerably reduces the amount of bookkeeping that would otherwise be necessary if we accounted for the correlations directly. The singular node l is said to be a cavity node or in the cavity state [23,51], a concept closely related to the test-node assumption [39] and the idea of cut vertices [63].

Derived from the message-passing framework [23,51], it inherits its accuracy on loop-free topologies and improves analytic estimations with respect to the IB approach for arbitrary time-evolving graphs. Moreover, the focus on edge-based quantities that are updated in discrete time steps allows a seamless integration of temporal interactions. Structurally similar to the node-centric IB model, the proposed CB approach poses a low conceptual barrier and admits application on large graphs.",

To this end, we have studied the largest eigenvalue of the infection propagator matrix, which determines the disease propagation in the low prevalence limit and takes into account the full temporal and topological information up to the observation time. The largest eigenvalue can be easily found through repeated matrix multiplications, i.e., the so-called power method. Without relying on extensive MC simulations and a subsequent parameter fit, the critical value can thus be estimated with efficient, vectorizable tools from linear algebra that are available for most high-level programming languages.",
