However, where the infection prevention and control strategies were strictly taken, nosocomial transmission has not been a major amplifier of transmission in this pandemic. 1 As of early March, the National Health Commission of China indicated that >3,300 HCWs had been infected (of whom 22 died). 2 In Italy, HCW infections make up 9.0% of Italy's COVID-19 cases, 3 which represents a serious concern because HCWs who are infected, if identified by a proper test, must stay away from healthcare facilities for at least 14 days, depleting the already exhausted workforce.",

In the same period, the largely hit Lombardy region recorded 3,957 affected HCWs of a total 28,750 cases (13.8%). 4 During the fourth epidemiological week of March, the 3 major Labor Unions (CGIL, CISL, and UIL) suggested that the percentage of HCWs infected was~50.0% of the total. Proportions soared in the province of Sassari, where 6 of 10 new cases were HCWs. 5 On the other hand, the most recent biweekly national epidemiological report indicates that 200 HCWs of 490 total persons tested in Sardinia were positive for SARS-CoV-2. 6 Such figures refer to something of unique relevance at the international level during this pandemic, and they align with findings from small outbreaks in Marburg and from Ebola virus outbreaks in which the nonendemic disease was suddenly introduced by an isolated traveler or individual. 7 Sassari is one of the few European settings that witnessed a case of Ebola during the large 2014 West African epidemic. 8 This event led to the implementation of a preparedness plan in line with international standards, with great emphasis on the use of PPE and appropriate protocols for the protection of health personnel.",
