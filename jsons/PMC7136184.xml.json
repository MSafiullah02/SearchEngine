HBeAg seroconversion rates were generally higher in HBeAg-positive patients receiving interferon therapies than nucleos(t)ide analogs. To offer better treatment responses, the assessment of pre-treatment viral factors (e.g., HBV genotypes), on-treatment viral factors (e.g., HBV DNA, HBsAg), host and environmental factors (e.g., patient age, ALT) is recommended for the initiation and continuation of HBV therapies [2\u20134]. Nevertheless, no single biomarker has been recognized to fully predict treatment responses [5, 6].",

As a potential predictor of treatment responses, serum HBV RNA is associated with intrahepatic cccDNA levels [10] and the persistence of viral infection and rebound [11]. For instance, an early decrease of HBV RNA effectively predicted HBeAg seroconversion in 62 patients receiving either lamivudine or tenofovir [12]. In a responder-enriched subpopulation of 76 patients treated with PegIFN\u03b1-2a, HBV RNA was recognized as a sound predictor of HBeAg seroconversion by univariate analyses alone [13], whereas its strength was unclear in large cohorts with non-responders.",

            "text": "Despite encouraging findings above, many aspects of HBV RNA remain unclear. First, dynamic changes of HBV RNA in large-scale cohorts of interferon-treated patients remain poorly understood, since previous studies focused mostly on nucleos(t)ide analogs. Second, it is ambiguous if HBV RNA acted as an effective predictor of interferon responses, particularly in a large cohort with non-responders. Third, to offer better responses, it remains unclear whether HBV RNA in combination with known HBV biomarkers could offer better predictive performance. Last, it remains unclear whether HBV RNA could predict HBsAg loss which is generally considered as a functional \u201ccure\u201d that signifies a favorable outcome of antiviral treatments [14, 15]. To address the above questions, we assessed HBV RNA in a longitudinal cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive patients who randomly received PegIFN\u03b1-2a or PegIFN\u03b1-2b. Based on this large-scale cohort, our findings support the hypothesis that even at the early interferon treatments, HBV RNA is a strong monitor of HBeAg seroconversion, despite its modest role in the prediction of HBsAg loss.",

Primers of HBV RNA-RACE, HBV RNA-forward, HBV RNA-reverse, and HBV RNA-probe (see Supplementary) that target conserved regions of the HBV genome were obtained from the literature [12]. Armored RNA internal controls were added during sample lysis [18]. In the absence of DNA polymerase and cDNA primers, HBV RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA under the temperature of 50 \u00b0C for 30 min. After adding DNA polymerases and cDNA primers, the cDNA amplification was performed by an activation step at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 50 two-step cycles (each cycle 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C), and a cooling step down to 25 \u00b0C for 10 s. The fluorescence of cDNA was detected and measured by the 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems\u00ae). More details are provided in our Supplementary.",

Fourth, a standard software, Cutoff Finder, was applied to optimize biomarker cutoffs [21]. The standard bootstrap resampling method was applied to generate 1000 randomized datasets in the fivefold cross-validation to avoid overestimation. The robustness of biomarker cutoffs was confirmed by bootstrapping resampling and cross-validation. Sixth, predictor importance estimates were measured by random forest classification (500 decision trees) with curvature tests for splitting predictors and surrogate splits for handling missing values.

Our study reveals three major findings that support the use of HBV RNA as an early on-treatment factor to estimate PegIFN\u03b1 responses. First, HBV RNA is not only positively correlated with traditional HBV biomarkers but also acts as a strong predictor of HBeAg seroconversion and a modest predictor of HBsAg loss. Second, HBV RNA at week 12 is an early predictor and its optimized cutoff at approximately 1000 copies/mL effectively forecasts HBeAg seroconversion, supporting the hypothesis that the suppression of HBV RNA at a low level may lead to better treatment outcomes. Third, HBV RNA plus traditional factors such as patient age, HBV genotype, and HBeAg considerably forecast PegIFN\u03b1 responses, even at the early period of week 12. An early prediction of treatment responses is of great clinical value, because PegIFN\u03b1 treatments are usually expensive and cause severe adverse events in the long term [22].",

In agreement with previous findings on nucleos(t)ide analogs [12], our study revealed the effectiveness of HBV RNA at week 12 to predict HBeAg seroconversion for interferon treatments. By monitoring HBV RNA dynamics over 72 weeks, we found that fast decreasing HBV RNA at week 12, but not the baseline HBV RNA, was a sound predictor of HBeAg seroconversion. A recent study, however, reported that HBV RNA outperformed HBeAg at baseline in 76 response-enriched patients treated with PegIFN\u03b1-2a [13]. This disagreement might be due to their cohort which only included response-enriched patients (n = 76, SR = 51%) screened from two different clinical trials (n = 271, SR = 32.1% and n = 130, SR = 36.2%). Despite this, our results and literature results support that low levels and fast decreases of HBV RNA are likely associated with treatment success even in the early period [23, 24].",

Based on our cohort of 727 patients, the 12-week cutoff of HBV RNA was optimized at 1000 copies/mL that effectively predicted HBeAg seroconversion. The favorable performance of HBV RNA cutoff was also highlighted by its better accuracy (76.6%) compared with HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg cutoffs (Table S3). Furthermore, early discontinuation of interferon treatments could be considered in HBeAg-positive patients who showed HBV RNA > 5.2 log10 copies/mL at week 12, because more than 95% of these patients were unable to achieve HBeAg seroconversion. In addition to the predictive performance of individual biomarkers, our study proved that multivariate combinations of HBV RNA plus HBeAg, patient age, and genotype B offered high levels of positive predictive value (95.2%) and specificity (99.8%). This provides clear evidence that HBV RNA can be effectively integrated with traditional biomarkers to monitor treatment responses.",

Our study focused on interferon treatments in HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic patients, while future analyses need to clarify HBV RNA in HBeAg-negative patients and associations between HBV RNA and cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The full-length HBV RNA could be quantified using our primers taken from previous publications [12, 23], but further studies need to confirm whether the encapsulated, polyadenylated serum HBV RNA is equal to full-length RNA or contains truncated RNA species [7]. Due to limited patients with HBsAg loss (2.9%) in our 72-week cohort, the associations of HBV RNA with HBsAg loss will be evaluated by our 5-year follow-up study.",
