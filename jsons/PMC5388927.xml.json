            "text": "The family Flaviviridae consists of three genera, the flaviviruses, the pestiviruses, and the hepatitis C viruses. Many members of the genus Flavivirus are arthropod-borne human pathogens, including four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (Gubler et al., 2007). More than 50 million, 200,000, and 50,000 human cases were reported annually for DENV, YFV, and JEV infections, respectively (Gubler et al., 2007). Since the initial outbreak of WNV in New York in 1999, the virus has caused thousands of human cases of infections each year and has spread throughout North America (Kramer et al., 2007). No effective antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of flavivirus infections. Human vaccines are currently available only for JEV, YFV, and TBEV. It has been well recognized that development of a vaccine for DENV is particularly challenging, because of the need to simultaneously immunize against all four DENV serotypes. Therefore, development of therapeutics is the priority for intervention in flavivirus infections.",

            "text": "The flavivirus genome is a plus-sense, single-stranded RNA of about 11,000 nucleotides (Lindenbach et al., 2007). The genomic RNA consists of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF), and a 3\u2032UTR. The single ORF encodes a long polyprotein that is co-translationally and post-translationally processed by viral and host proteases into ten mature viral proteins. The N-terminus of the polyprotein contains three structural proteins: capsid (C), premembrane (prM/M), and envelope (E). The C-terminus of the polyprotein contains seven nonstructural (NS) proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. Complete cleavage of the polyprotein generates a 2K peptide between NS4A and NS4B. The 2K peptide spans the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Two viral proteins have enzymatic activities. NS3 functions as a protease (with NS2B as a cofactor), a nucleotide triphosphatase, an RNA triphosphatase, and a helicase (Falgout et al., 1993, Li et al., 1999, Warrener et al., 1993, Wengler and Wengler, 1991). NS5 acts as a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001, Egloff et al., 2002, Guyatt et al., 2001, Ray et al., 2006, Tan et al., 1996). Besides functioning in replication, flaviviral NS proteins play roles in virion assembly (Jones et al., 2005, Kummerer and Rice, 2002, Leung et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2003) and evasion of host innate immune responses (Best et al., 2005, Guo et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2005, Munoz-Jordan et al., 2005, Munoz-Jordan et al., 2003). Upon viral entry and nucleocapsid uncoating, the genomic RNA is translated into proteins, which are translocated across the ER membrane to form the replication complexes (Lindenbach et al., 2007). The molecular details of individual NS proteins and their roles in flavivirus replication remain to be characterized.",

Structural modifications of the lycorine compound increased its potency while decreasing its cytotoxicity, indicating the potential for the compound's therapeutic development. Furthermore, we found that a single-amino acid substitution in WNV 2K peptide confers resistance to lycorine, partially through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis, thus revealing a direct role of the 2K peptide in flavivirus RNA replication.",

To test whether lycorine inhibits flaviviruses, we initially screened the compound using a viral-like particle (VLP)-based infection assay. As depicted in Fig. 1B, VLPs of WNV and DENV-1 were prepared by trans-supply viral structural proteins (CprME; through an alphavirus Semliki Forest virus [SFV] expression vector) to package corresponding replicon RNAs containing a luciferase reporter (Rluc2A-Rep). The titers of the VLPs were estimated to be 2.5 \u00d7 106 and 2.4 \u00d7 103 FFU/ml for WNV and DENV-1, respectively. Vero cells were infected with 1 FFU/cell of WNV VLP or with 0.01 FFU/cell of DENV-1 VLP (due to the low titer of DENV-1 VLP). The infected cells were treated with 1.5 \u03bcM lycorine or were mock-treated with 1% DMSO. At 24 h post-infection (p.i.), lycorine reduced the luciferase signals by 1400- and 1200-fold in the WNV and DENV-1 VLP-infected cells, respectively (Fig. 1C). Higher concentrations of lycorine were also tested; however, due to cytotoxicity, these results are not presented (see next section). The results indicate that lycorine inhibits WNV and DENV-1.",

Remarkably, the G6871A virus showed a resistance level close to those of the P12 viruses from all three selections (Fig. 6C). Sequencing of the G6871A mutant virus indicated that the engineered mutation was retained without extra changes; furthermore, the G6871A mutation was retained after passaging the mutant virus in Vero cells for five rounds (total 10 days; data not shown). These results demonstrate that the G6871A mutation in the 2K peptide is the major determinant for lycorine resistance. Sequence alignment (Fig. 6D) indicates that the mutated Val at amino-acid position 9 of the 2K peptide (total of 23 amino acids) is conserved among the members of the JEV-serocomplex; and a Val at position 10 is conserved among the members of the DENV-serocomplex; whereas no Val is found at a similar position in the 2K peptides from members of the YFV- and TBEV-serocomplexes.",

For the MT virus, the expression levels of viral NS1, NS3, and NS5 increased from 24 to 36 h p.i., but decreased at 48 h p.i.; the decrease in protein expression at 48 h p.i. was due to cytopathic effect (i.e., cell lysis). At each time point, lycorine treatment suppressed viral protein expression. These results confirm the critical role of the G6871A mutation in lycorine resistance.",

Among them, compound 1200, in which the hydroxyl group at the C1-position is acetylated and the C2 hydroxyl group is oxidized to form a carbonyl group, slightly increased the potency (EC50\n =  0.19 \u03bcM), while significantly reducing cytotoxicity (CC50\n > 300 \u03bcM, the highest tested concentration).

The current study has extended the antiviral spectrum to flaviviruses. In addition, we showed that lycorine does not inhibit an alphavirus, WEEV, and a rhabdovirus, VSV, (Fig. 3). The latter results, together with findings of an early study showing that lycorine does not inhibit HIV-1 at a noncytotoxic concentration (Szlavik et al., 2004), indicate the selectivity of the antiviral spectrum of the compound. As a proof-of-principle, we showed that modifications of the lycorine compound, especially at the two hydroxyl groups, could dramatically reduce its cytotoxicity, while improve its potency (Table 1). The results suggest that lycorine represents one class of inhibitor that could potentially be developed for flavivirus therapeutics.",

First, a VLP-infection-based assay allowed identification of inhibitors of viral entry and replication (Fig. 1C). Second, use of Replicon-containing cell lines allowed screening for inhibitors of viral replication (Fig. 4A). Third, a transient replicon assay allowed differentiation between inhibitors of translation and inhibitors of RNA synthesis (Fig. 4B). Analysis of the compound in the above systems indicated that whereas lycorine only weakly reduces viral translation (< 30%, as indicated by luciferase activity), it significantly suppresses RNA synthesis (> 99%, as indicated by luciferase activity). The reduction of RNA synthesis could be caused by the compound-mediated suppression of viral translation. Alternatively, lycorine could suppress both translation and RNA synthesis, leading to the dramatic reduction of RNA synthesis. To differentiate between the above two possibilities, we performed a time-of-addition experiment. The results showed that lycorine gradually declined its anti-WNV activity, when the time of addition was varied from 0 to 10 h p.i.; the compound completely lost the inhibitory activity when added at > 10 p.i. (Fig. 4C). A single round of flavivirus infection is about 12 h in duration, with viral translation peaking around 2\u20136 h p.i. and RNA synthesis peaking around 7\u201312 h p.i. (Chambers et al., 1990, Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2005). If lycorine only inhibited the step of translation, it would have completely lost its antiviral activity when added at a time point earlier than 10 h p.i. (i.e., at 6 h p.i.). Therefore, the time-of-addition results clearly indicate that the compound inhibits a step beyond viral translation. These data, together with the identification of the resistance determinant in the 2K peptide (Fig. 6), led us to conclude that lycorine suppresses WNV mainly through suppression of viral RNA synthesis.",

Engineering of the mutations (recovered from the resistant viruses) into an infectious clone (Fig. 6) and a replicon (Fig. 8A) of WNV allowed us to map the resistance determinant to a single amino-acid change (Val9Met) in the 2K peptide. It should be noted that the resistance results do not necessarily indicate that the 2K peptide is the direct target for lycorine. The 2K peptide mutation could exert its resistance phenotype through enhancement of viral replication so that, in the presence of inhibitor, viral replication could still be sustained at a level sufficient to generate virus. The latter scenario is supported by the observations that the 2K peptide mutation enhanced RNA synthesis of WNV replicon as well as the growth kinetics of WNV in Vero and C6/36 cells (Fig. 8). However, it should be pointed out that the 2K mutation-mediated enhancement of viral replication only partially contributes to the lycorine resistance. The latter conclusion was supported by the results that the 2K mutation increased replication by only 2 to 4-fold in the absence of lycorine (Fig. 8B), whereas the same mutation increased replication by > 100-fold in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 7A).",

            "text": "How does the 2K peptide mutation enhance WNV RNA replication? Flavivirus 2K peptide spans the ER membrane with its N- and C-terminal tails on the cytoplasmic and ER lumen sides, respectively (Miller et al., 2007). The cleavage at the 2K-NS4B junction by host signalase requires a prior cleavage at the NS4A-2K junction by viral NS2B/NS3 protease (Lin et al., 1993). The regulated cleavages at the NS4A-2K-NS4B sites play a role in rearranging cytoplasmic membranes (Miller et al., 2007, Roosendaal et al., 2006). The exact function of the 2K peptide in induction of membrane arrangement may differ among flaviviruses. In KUNV, individual expression of NS4A-2K resulted in membrane rearrangements that most resembling virus-induced structures, while removal of the 2K domain led to a less profound membrane rearrangement (Roosendaal et al., 2006). In contrast, expression of DENV-2 NS4A without 2K peptide resulted in altered membranes resembling virus-induced structures, whereas expression of NS4A-2K did not induce comparable membrane arrangement (Miller et al., 2007). Since the rearranged membranes form the scaffold for the viral replication complex, the Val9Met mutation may affect the 2K peptide-mediated membrane alterations, leading to an increase in RNA replication.",

The weakened interferon response allowed the virus to replicate to a higher level. This hypothesis is supported by our observations that the same 2K peptide mutation was recovered from the WNV that was able to perform superinfections (Zhang and Shi, unpublished data). In the later study, we found that the 2K peptide mutant virus showed improved capability to replicate in cells that contain persistently replicating replicon of WNV. One caveat to this hypothesis is that our lycorine resistance study was performed in Vero cells, in which the interferon gene has been deleted (Mosca and Pitha, 1986). More experiments are required to dissect the molecular mechanism of the 2K peptide that is operative in flavivirus replication or in evasion of the host immune response.",

The construction and characterization of the WNV and DENV-1 Rluc2A-Rep were reported previously (Lo et al., 2003, Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2006). The structural genes of each virus were cloned into an SFV expression vector (Invitrogen) (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991) at a unique Bam HI site, resulting in SFV-CprME (Fig. 1B). A Kozak sequence and a stop codon were engineered at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the CprME fragment, respectively. A double-transfection protocol was used to generate the VLPs (Khromykh et al., 1998, Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2005). Briefly, BHK-21 cells (8 \u00d7 106) were first electroporated with 10 \u03bcg of Rluc2A-Rep RNA in a 0.4-cm cuvette with the GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) using settings of 0.85 kV and 25 \u03bcF, pulsing three times at 3-sec intervals. The transfected cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The replicon-transfected cells were then electroporated with 10 \u03bcg of SFV-CprME RNA of the corresponding virus, at the settings identical to those used for the first transfection. At 24 h after the second transfection, culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The VLPs in the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at-80\u00b0C. The titers of VLPs (in focus-forming units [FFU]/ml) were estimated by infection of Vero cells in a four-chamber Lab-Tek Chamber Slide (Nalge Nunc International) with serial dilutions of the culture fluid, followed by counting of immunofluorescence assay (IFA)-positive cell foci at 18 and 24 h p.i. for WNV and DENV-1, respectively.
