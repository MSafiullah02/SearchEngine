            "text": "Influenza viruses remain the most frequently identified causes of viral infection in the lung, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a major cause of severe pneumonia in children worldwide and is an increasingly recognized cause of illness in adults and elderly patients. Other agents, such as rhinovirus (RV), have been increasingly detected mirroring advances in molecular and serologic diagnostic techniques and increased surveillance programs. Nonetheless, the diversity of viral agents that cause pulmonary disease is extremely broad and continues to expand (Table 13.1\n). Several newly recognized viral pathogens have been identified in the past few decades that are among the most feared and lethal of all emerging infections, including those caused by hantaviruses, Nipah virus, pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Conversely, certain viral infections, particularly those that occur in vulnerable patient cohorts, have diminished during this same interval. For example, the U.S. incidence of varicella pneumonia has declined more than 65% since universal childhood vaccination for varicella was implemented in 1995, and advances in the clinical management of transplant recipients have reduced the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. This chapter captures and describes select viral diseases in which the pulmonary system is a main target of infection, although it is important to note that other viral agents have been detected in pulmonary tissue, such as chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, rabies virus, and Heartland virus, typically in the context of systemic disease.",

            "text": "It is estimated that approximately 5% to 10% of all pneumonias in infants and young children are caused by adenoviruses. Most pediatric cases of adenovirus pneumonia occur between 6 months and 5 years of age and are caused by serotypes 3, 7, and 21, with serotypes 3 and 7 being particularly pathogenic adenoviruses with the ability to result in disseminated and often fatal disease in previously healthy children. The majority of infections in pediatric populations spontaneously resolve and often do not result in clinically apparent illness. In adults, pneumonia is generally associated with serotypes 3, 4, and 7. Periodic epidemics of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults have been identified, such as with the reemergence of adenovirus subtypes 14 and 55 that have been associated with severe disease in military camps, hospitals, and schools in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In a manner similar to other pathogens, adenoviruses take advantage of impaired or destroyed immune systems to establish persistent and disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts, a population that is susceptible to a broader range of different serotypes. Because some adenoviruses establish latency in lymphoid tissues and the kidneys of their host, it is believed that many, possibly most, cases of clinical disease caused by adenoviruses in immunocompromised patients are reactivated infections.",

Affected airways may be occluded by homogeneous eosinophilic material, mixed inflammatory cells, detached epithelium, and cellular debris. The lamina propria of bronchi and bronchioles is typically congested and infiltrated by predominantly mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates. Tracheal and bronchial serous and mucous glands are also often involved and show necrosis and mixed inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. 13.1C). As the infection progresses, there is involvement of the more distal pulmonary parenchyma, forming foci of bronchocentric necrosis with hemorrhage, neutrophilic and mononuclear cell infiltrates, and karyorrhexis (Fig. 13.1B). These findings occur against a background of diffuse alveolar damage. Adenoviruses form intranuclear inclusions in respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles; in the acinar cells of bronchial glands; and in alveolar pneumocytes and are generally most abundant at the viable edges of necrotic foci. On hematoxylin-eosin stain, early inclusions appear as small, dense, amphophilic structures surrounded by a cleared zone and peripherally marginated chromatin, similar to herpetic inclusions. As the cellular infection progresses, the inclusion becomes larger (as large as 14 microns in some cells) and more basophilic, and the margins of the nuclear membrane become blurred to form the characteristic \u201csmudge cell\u201d (Fig. 13.1C and D). Concurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections are common.",

Electron microscopy of adenovirus-infected tissues reveals a paracrystalline array of virions represented by icosahedral capsids that measure 70 to 90 nm in diameter (Fig. 13.1F). Most adenoviruses can be isolated in cell culture from bronchial washings, tracheal aspirates, or lung biopsy specimens during the early stage of the illness.

Fever, myalgia, headache, vomiting, weakness, and cough are common symptoms in early phases of both HFRS and HPS. Renal involvement is seen in all cases of HFRS, and the clinical presentation ranges from a mild illness with minimal renal dysfunction to a more severe form with acute renal failure and shock. Only HFRS patients who die during the later phases of renal failure typically show significant pulmonary edema. The clinical picture for HPS is quite different from that for HFRS. The initial prodrome is followed by rapidly progressive pulmonary edema, respiratory insufficiency, and shock. In fatal cases, the majority of deaths occur within 6.4 days of hospitalization. Hemorrhages and peripheral signs of vasomotor instability, such as flushing, conjunctival injection, and periorbital edema as seen in HFRS, are extremely rare. Hematologic features on peripheral blood smears, including neutrophils without significant toxic change, myelocytosis, increased circulating immunoblastic lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration, in combination with acute pulmonary edema, is very suggestive of a presumptive diagnosis of hantavirus infection.\n",

Vascular thrombi and endothelial cell necrosis are rare. In HFRS, the most severe and characteristic microscopic lesions involve the kidney and include microvascular inflammation, medullary interstitial hemorrhages, and acute tubular necrosis; however, an interstitial pneumonitis can also be seen in some fatal cases. In contrast, the microscopic changes in HPS are principally seen in the lung and spleen. The lungs show a mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonitis with interstitial mononuclear cells composed of a mixture of small and enlarged mononuclear cells with the appearance of immunoblasts and variable degrees of edema (Fig. 13.2A\n). Focal hyaline membranes composed of condensed proteinaceous intraalveolar edema fluid, fibrin, and variable numbers of inflammatory cells are observed. Typically, neutrophils are scant, and the alveolar pneumocytes are intact with no evidence of cellular debris, nuclear fragmentation, or hyperplasia. In fatal cases, with a prolonged survival interval, tissues show features more characteristic of the exudative and proliferative stages of diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 13.2B).

PCR detects viral RNA in blood and tissues and is extremely useful for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes.

IHC testing of formalin-fixed tissues is a sensitive method to confirm hantaviral infections, and viral antigens are found primarily within capillary endothelium throughout various tissues in both HPS and HFRS (Fig. 13.2C). In HPS, marked accumulations of hantaviral antigens are found in the pulmonary microvasculature and in splenic and lymph nodal follicular dendritic cells. Electron microscopic studies of HPS lung tissue demonstrate infection of endothelial cells and macrophages.

Tracheobronchitis and pneumonia are the primary respiratory tract manifestations of HSV infection. In adults, infection of the respiratory tract with HSV may be associated with disseminated herpetic infection but is more commonly identified as an isolated disease manifestation resulting from reactivation of latent herpetic infections in the oropharynx. Mucocutaneous herpetic infection generally precedes HSV pneumonia, and aspiration of virus-containing secretions into the lower respiratory tract is believed to be the most frequent cause of pulmonary infection with HSV; however, oral lesions may be absent in patients with herpetic laryngotracheitis and bronchopneumonia. Disease can also be associated with airway trauma caused by tracheal intubation or from hematogenous dissemination of HSV. Newborn infants, severely immunosuppressed or burned patients, and patients with severe trauma are at greatest risk of developing HSV pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract disease in neonates is most commonly associated with disseminated herpetic infections. Most cases of neonatal disease represent primary HSV infections and are acquired during parturition from HSV-infected mothers. The incidence of neonatal HSV infection is approximately 1 in 3,200 deliveries, and disseminated disease develops in approximately 25% of infected neonates.

Isolation of the virus in cell culture remains the reference standard for the diagnosis of VZV. Infectious VZV is usually recoverable from the clear fluid of cutaneous vesicles of varicella for approximately 3 days after the appearance of these lesions and for approximately 1 week from herpes zoster lesions. Under electron microscopy, VZV has an icosahedral nucleocapsid that is indistinguishable in appearance from other herpesviruses. The enveloped viral particle is pleomorphic to spherical in shape and 180 to 200 nm in diameter.\n",

Uncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional and respiratory signs and symptoms, including fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. Among children, otitis media, nausea, and vomiting are also commonly reported. Influenza typically resolves after 3 to 7 days in most patients, although cough and malaise can persist for more than 2 weeks. Pandemic 2009 H1N1 resulted in illness ranging from mild to severe and fatal, with over 12,000 deaths and estimates of over 60 million cases in the United States from 2009 to 2010. Complications include secondary bacterial pneumonias, febrile seizures, and, uncommonly, encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, Reye syndrome, myositis, myocarditis, and pericarditis.

During their first RSV infection, between 25% and 40% of infants and young children have signs or symptoms of bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and 0.5% to 2% require hospitalization. The majority of children hospitalized for RSV infection are less than 6 months of age or are children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or immunosuppression.

An increase in EV-D68 cases has been reported since 2008, including an outbreak in 2014 affecting more than 1,000 individuals across the United States. It is not entirely clear whether this increase is due to improved molecular identification and/or an increasing incidence. In addition, association of virus with illness can be complicated by the high prevalence of EVs, particularly RVs, in asymptomatic individuals. Symptoms include dyspnea, pharyngitis, cough, bronchiolitis, sinusitis, asthma exacerbation, wheezing, and pneumonia. Fever is not seen in all cases.

Ribavirin was used in humans during the Nipah outbreak in Malaysia, with equivocal results, and passive immunization targeting the Nipah G glycoprotein has been evaluated as postexposure therapy in a ferret model and found to be of benefit.\n",

Typical manifestations are related to a loss of vascular regulation (vasodilatation and hypotension), vascular damage (leakage of protein into the urine, edema in soft tissues of the face and other loose connective tissues, and petechial hemorrhage in the skin and internal organs), and severe systemic derangement that presents as fever, myalgia, and asthenia proceeding to a state of prostration. Hemorrhage is common with most of these diseases and usually originates from mucosal surfaces. Patients with severe hemorrhagic fever generally develop shock, diffuse bleeding, and central nervous system dysfunction.",

However, in many VHF patients manifestations of bleeding may be minimal or absent. Effusions, occasionally hemorrhagic, are also frequently seen. Widespread, focal, and sometimes massive necrosis is commonly observed in all organ systems and is often ischemic in nature. Necrosis is usually most prominent in the liver and lymphoid tissues. The most consistent microscopic feature is found in the liver and consists of multifocal hepatocellular necrosis with cytoplasmic eosinophilia, Councilman bodies, nuclear pyknosis, and cytolysis. Inflammatory cell infiltrates and necrotic areas are usually mild and, when present, consist of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. Commonly observed histopathologic changes in the lung include various degrees of hemorrhage, intraalveolar edema, interstitial pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 13.17A and E\n).\n",

The diagnosis suspected by history and clinical manifestations can also be supported histopathologically. However, because of similar pathologic features seen in VHF and a variety of other viral, rickettsial, and bacterial infections, as well as noninfectious causes of hemorrhage, edema, and diffuse alveolar damage, unequivocal diagnosis can be made only by laboratory tests such as cell culture isolation, serology, PCR, and IHC (Fig. 13.17B, C, and F). Ultrastructural studies can also demonstrate the presence of virions. All viruses have a lipid envelope that is acquired by budding at either the cell surface or the internal membranes. The size and shape of these viruses vary from relatively small (35\u201350 nm), uniform, round particles, as seen with flaviviruses, to more pleomorphic, rod-shaped particles (measuring occasionally up to 15,000 nm) in the case of filoviruses (Fig. 13.17D).",
