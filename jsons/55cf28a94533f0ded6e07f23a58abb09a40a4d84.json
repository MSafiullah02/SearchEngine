While agents have their initial preferences on issues, they may influence others and be influenced by others, consequently changing their preferences or choices on these issues in the process of decision-making. Though the influence among multiple agents making decisions on one issue and the dependency (influence) among multiple issues decided by one agent have been fully discussed in previous work, the influence from multiple sources across both agents and issues in the context of combinatorial and collective decision-making has been ignored. In this paper, we proposed a preliminary framework to address the influence transcending multiple agents and multiple issues with two rules: weighted influence and one dominant influence.",

While agents have their initial preferences on a series of issues, they may interact with each other, be fully motivated to influence others, and, accordingly, be influenced by others, consequently changing their preferences and ultimately their choices on these issues in the process of decisionmaking [32] . The influence on preferences or choices is achieved via the exchange and diffusion of information among agents and across issues. The information that agents exchange can be from other agents' observable (decision-making) behaviors [32] or from others agents' declared or shared preferences (underlying their choices) [25] .",

For example, in international politics, the decision-making process of the United Nations (UN) Security Council entails various influences among member states, including both positive influences among allies and negative influences among opponents. Each member state in the UN Security Council has full motivation to convince and influence other member states' votes in order to gain desired voting results and maximize its own state interests. Member states in the same alliance usually support each other, therefore positively influencing each other. For instance, the United Kingdom usually casts the same votes as the United States. However, member states from confronting camps usually oppose each other, thereby negatively influencing each other. For instance, the former Soviet Union 1 and present-day Russia usually veto the draft resolutions proposed by the United States.",

When an agent is making decisions on a series of issues, it is natural for him/her to refer to his/her own choices regarding the same or similar issues in the past. Namely, an agent's preferences/choices on later issues are usually dependent on (or affected by) his/her own choices on prior issues. There are both positive and negative dependencies among issues. An agent will positively reference (usually, make the same decision as) his/her satisfactory choices in the past but will negatively reference (usually, make the opposite decision to) his/her regrettable choices from the past. For example, in international politics, the United States always used its veto power on the draft resolutions to punish Israel in the UN Security Council, not only for its own state interests but also for its reputation in the international community and particularly in the mind of its allies (a great power should be constant and trustworthy regarding its attitudes toward critical issues and provide a stable expectation for its allies).",

            "text": "It should be noted that traditionally, the dependency among issues would not be deemed the influence, but in fact, the dependency among issues could be understood as a \"special\" kind of influence. The dependency among issues means that the preferences/choices of an agent on later issues will be affected by his/her own choices on former issues, in a sense, such \"affected\" just means \"influenced\". Based on and improving upon the models of [32, 33] , we build a framework to model the influence across multiple agents and multiple issues, where agents express their preferences as CP-nets, and influences (dependencies) among agents (issues) are expressed as directed links in networks. Before officially representing this framework, we introduce related works on the study of influence in combinatorial and collective decision-making using Example 1, as follows: Example 1. (UN Security Council Decision-making) This is a typical example of combinatorial and collective decision-making with influences among agents (member states) and dependencies among issues (draft resolutions). First, the UN Security Council decision-making is a typical multi-agent (collective) decision. There are 15 member states (including 5 permanent members and 10 nonpermanent members) collectively making decisions for each draft resolution. Each member state tries to persuade (represented as positively influencing) its allies 2 and opposes (represented as being negatively influenced by) its opponents, in order to pursue its own state interests and achieve desirable voting results on critical international issues. It is easy to see that the UN Security Council is full of varied games, interactions and persuasions among member states, which means that there are influences (expressed as the horizontal directed links shown in Fig. 1 ) among agents (member states). The models describing the influence among agents are mainly the social influence models [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 19, 20, 25, 26, 35, 37] .",

For instance, a vote of China may be influenced by Russia, the United States and some other states at the same time. As such, how do we address the multiple sources of influence and determine the resulting preference or choice, especially in light of contradictive influencing directions (such as a positive influence from Russia and a negative influence from the United States) and diversified influencing weights (such as a stronger influence from a great power and a weaker influence from a small country)?

More specifically, with the advancement of wireless network technology and mobile communication devices, particularly with the help of online social platforms, such as Facebook , Twitter , and WeChat , interaction and communication among people (particularly those in remote locations) have become much more convenient and frequent than before [22] [23] [24] 27, 31, 34] . If you like, you can instantly communicate with others overseas. Keeping in touch with friends who are far away is no longer a problem in the sense of space, time and environment. Thus, current studies in decision-making should typically involve a very large number of agents interacting with each other and making decisions on a series of issues as opposed to restricted cases consisting of a few agents making decisions on a single issue, or a few issues decided by a single agent. In this context, not only should the preference/choice of each single agent for each single issue be discussed, but also the interaction and influence among different agents on different issues should be fully investigated, which makes the study of psychology and behavior of a decision-maker, the mechanisms and dimensions of influence, and the aggregation for collective preference/choice in group decision-making much more complicated. 3 Moreover, it is not that simple as we might expect even for the influence just among multiple agents (while making decisions on a single issue), as the influence of reality faced by an agent usually comes not from a single agent at a time but from more than one agent at the same time [25, 26] . There are a series of approaches to address multiple sources of influence in group decision-making:",

As both the subject of influence and the object of influence are utility values of agents, it is a cardinal (utility value-based) approach. Moreover, it assumes all influence as positive, which may be oversimplifying compared with reality. It is certain that there are positive influences from friends, families, or relatives and so on; however, it is also impossible to avoid all negative influences from enemies, opponents, or any person with a negative appreciation in real-world settings [25] .",

Actually, the use of the weight of influence is a traditional approach to address the influence among agents in group decision-making and has been much discussed in previous works such as [20, 25, 26, 37] . In the empathetic social choice model [37] built via a cardinal approach, the utility value of the influenced agent is the weighted sum of utilities of all influencing agents (including himself/herself and his/her \"neighbors\"). Luo [25] extended classical social choice functions, such as the Borda count and the Condorcet method, to signed and weighted social influence functions, which means that both positive and negative influences and both stronger and weaker influences (from all influencing agents) are collectively handled to obtain the resulting choice (of the influenced agent). Moreover, Luo [25] extended the KSB metric [1, 21, 38, 39 ] to a signed and weighted matrix influence function to address the multiple sources of influence among agents via an ordering-based approach; he first defined the rule of how to transform each preference ordering (including both the preference orderings held by the influencing agents and the preference orderings existing in theory) 7 into a matrix and then set a distance metric to compute the distance between any two ordering matrices; the feasible preference ordering that has the smallest weighted sum of distances from all influencing agents' preference orderings will then be the resulting preference (of the influenced agent) [25, 26] . As the weight of agents' influences can be either positive or negative (namely, as friends or enemies) in real-world settings, it will partially play a role in finding the \"closest\" possible preference from the positively influencing agents' preferences and partially play a role in finding the \"farthest\" possible preference from the negatively influencing agents' preferences for the resulting preference [25] .",

However, these models all have potentials to be extended to address the influence transcending multiple agents and multiple issues in the context of combinatorial and collective decision-making. To achieve this, a precondition is to build a weight matrix whose entries are the weights of influence from each decision-making variable C i,q to each of the other decisionmaking variables C j,h (i, j \u2208 N, q, h \u2208 I).",

The latter oneself will inevitably be influenced by the former oneself, and the weight of one's own influence is usually positive [25] . Only in some extreme cases, assume a person encounters serious setbacks and totally loses his/her self-confidence, then his/her own influence could change from strong to weak, and even from positive to negative [25] . Such setup of one's own influence can explain why some people are hard to be influenced by others while some other people are easy to be changed because the former kind of people's self-influences may have higher weights than the latter [25] .

A concept of the priority of influence can be proposed to find the most predominant influencing preference/choice. Assume that there are n\u00d7m decisionmaking variables (namely, n agents making decisions on m issues) and that there is a priority of influence from each decision-making variable C i,q to each of the other decision-making variables C j,h (i, j \u2208 N, q, h \u2208 I). Thus, each decisionmaking variable will be influenced by the influencing decision-making variable with the highest priority (of influence) on it compared with all of the other influencing decision-making variables. Actually, one simple method to obtain the priority of influence is to connect it to the weight of influence. Specifically, we make the priority of influence between each of two decision-making variables equal to the absolute value of the weight of influence between them. Thus, for each preference/choice being influenced, the influencing preference/choice that has the highest absolute value of the weight of influence on it also has the highest priority of influence on it and can dominate its result of influence. Intuitively, this rule for addressing multiple sources of influence across agents and issues can remarkably reduce the complexity of the computation.",

For example, while facing a complicated case of multiple influences from many people making decisions on many issues, you will just follow your best friend (or highest leader) on the most important issue for yourself, or just oppose your most hated enemy on the most critical issue for him/her (only if the absolute value of his/her weight of influence on this issue is the highest, regardless of whether it is positive or negative) rather than engage in a complex weighted deliberation and computation. Fig. 5 . Though agent 3 faces complicated multiple influences across both agents and issues while making a decision on issue Z, which is the same case as in Example 6, he/she will just follow the influencing decision-making variable with the highest priority of influence (namely, the highest absolute value of the weight of influence here), which is just the preference/choice of himself/herself on former issue Y . This way to address multiple sources of influence is just like ignoring all other influences except the most predominant one, in mathematics, as if resetting all other influencing preferences/choices' weights to zero (compared with Fig. 4) .
