Since its discovery the principle of passive immunisation has been used extensively for treating and preventing diseases in animals and humans (Baxter, 2007, Eibl, 2008, Hsu and Safdar, 2011), supplementing active immunisation, i.e. vaccination. In contrast to vaccination, administration of immunoglobulin establishes instant immunity and provides short term protection with no induction of immunological memory. For most applications it works across species, i.e. the species origin of the immunoglobulins is less important. Also, in contrast to active immunisation, existing antibodies (e.g. maternally derived) do not interfere with passive immunity provided by administration of immunoglobulins. The main drawbacks of passive immunisation include the risk of adverse reactions to the administered immunoglobulins, especially if given repeatedly and if given as a non-purified preparation.",

Thus in the present era of increasing problems with antibiotics resistance development (see below), immunisation methods are becoming attractive for wider application to the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in production animals. However, a main prerequisite for this use is their cost-effectiveness compared to antibiotics which are presently used very extensively as inexpensive and highly efficient means for reducing animal morbidity and mortality, boosting food conversion, animal welfare and growth (De Briyne et al., 2014, Garcia-Migura et al., 2014). The possible role of the wide use of antibiotics in the surge of microbial antibiotics resistance experienced during the last few decades is discussed in (Barton, 2000, Bester and Essack, 2012, Garcia et al., 2011, Hong et al., 2007, Mendez Arancibia et al., 2009). The situation threatens to become a major problem for treating infectious diseases in humans (Barton, 2000, Fairbrother et al., 2005) and, generally, increased human mortality associated with antibiotics resistant bacteria has been predicted (CDC, 2013, de Kraker et al., 2011, ECDC/EMEA, 2009, WHO, 2012).",

However, as discussed extensively below, passive immunisation in the form of orally administered immunoglobulins represents an easily applied and affordable solution for immediate treatment of and short term protection against enteral infections, having the potential for being a real alternative to the use of antibiotics in the animal production, especially for intervention at specific time periods in the production in which animals are particularly exposed to enteric infectious disease such as at birth and at weaning. In addition, passive immunisation can be and are currently used for other types of infectious diseases in production animals using a range of different administration routes (see below).",

            "text": "Evolutionarily, transfer of maternal immunoglobulins to offspring can be traced as far back as 450 million years ago, being found in primitive fish like the nurse shark (Haines et al., 2005). In some mammals, including primates and rabbits, the foetus obtains immunoglobulin (Ig) G over the placenta (Hurley and Theil, 2011, Palmeira et al., 2012) and the new-born is thus born with circulating mammalian IgG, persisting in the systemic circulation for some months after birth. The half-life of circulatory IgG in man is around 3 weeks (see below, Table 1\n), thus it has been observed that maternal antibodies are detectable in children 2\u20133 months after birth as seen in a study on circulating maternal anti-Neisseria meningitidis IgG (Shahid et al., 2002). This is supplemented during lactation by the intake of maternal IgA-type immunoglobulin through the milk building up local immunity in the gastrointestinal tract (Malek, 2013). In other mammals such as pigs and ruminants, placental immunoglobulin transfer does not take place and consequently the neonate is born agammaglobulinemic (without immunoglobulin), having neither received maternal immunoglobulin nor initiated their own production of immunoglobulins. Instead, these species are born with an \u2018open gut\u2019 allowing Fc-receptor-mediated immunoglobulin transfer from the gut to the circulation for the first approximately 24 h after birth assuring the very quick establishment of the necessary circulating levels of maternal immunoglobulins through ingestion of colostrum which in these species contains high concentrations of IgG (Cervenak and Kacskovics, 2009). Notably in pigs, colostral IgG concentrations decrease by 80% within 24 h of parturition (Foisnet et al., 2010). A variation of this is seen in rodents and some other species, including mink, where the neonate is born with a certain level of circulating maternal immunoglobulins and has its gut open for transfer of immunoglobulin from the milk for 2\u20133 weeks postnatally (Brambell, 1966, Kim et al., 2009). In chickens, the pre-hatching chick receives maternal immunoglobulin through the yolk sac of the egg and therefore is \u2018born\u2019 with maternal immunoglobulin at hatching (Kowalczyk et al., 1985).",

            "text": "The natural transfer of maternal immunity has to some extent been exploited to passively immunize offspring by maternal vaccination. For example, prevention of rotavirus infection, which has a great economic impact in husbandry, especially in cattle- and hog production (Saif and Fernandez, 1996), can be obtained by vaccination of lactating cows against rotavirus resulting in subsequent passive immunity-mediated protection in calves receiving colostrum from the vaccinated cows (Le Rousic et al., 2000, Parreno et al., 2004, Saif and Fernandez, 1996, Tsunemitsu et al., 1989). Similar observations on lactogenic immunity against rotavirus have been made in pigs (Fu et al., 1990). Likewise, neonate offspring from cows vaccinated with an extract of ETEC (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) O101:K99 were protected against enteral colibacilliosis (otherwise causing fatal diarrhoea in calves) (Nagy, 1980), and moreover protection against Salmonella Typhimurium was obtained by vaccinating dams with formalin-fixed Salmonella Typhimurium (Jones et al., 1988) after experimental challenge. Furthermore, a combined vaccination of pregnant cows against E. coli and rotavirus is an efficient means of protecting against calf diarrhoea (Combs et al., 1993, Snodgrass et al., 1982). Lactogenic immunity against larval cestodes and metacestodes has also been reported (Larsh, 1942, Lloyd and Soulsby, 1976). For lactogenic immunity to be efficient, it was show that the vaccine had to be administered to the dams at least two weeks before parturition to allow enough time for adequate antibody titres to develop (Haggard et al., 1982). Oro-gastric immunity has been demonstrated in piglets provided with milk from immuno-competent lactating sows as seen by a decrease in faecal shedding of haemolytic E. coli by suckling piglets whereas milk from non-immune sources did not reduce shedding (Deprez et al., 1986). Passive immunisation of piglets by immunisation of the pregnant sow a few weeks before parturition has also been demonstrated in a porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) infection model; intramuscular injection of the sow with live attenuated PEDV 2\u20134 weeks before farrowing conferred significant protection to the suckling piglets (Kweon et al., 1999).",

This becomes critical in situations in which vulnerability to infection is present at the same time as colostrum derived antibodies. As an example anti-hepatitis A virus specific antibodies passed on from mother to infant persists for up to 6 months in the new-born preventing vaccination of infants against hepatitis A virus in this period (Vidor, 2007). Also, vaccinating pregnant sows at the right time before farrowing can protect piglets against Foot-and Mouth Disease (FMD) through colostrum derived maternal antibodies (Francis and Black, 1984a, Francis and Black, 1984b) for a limited period of time after birth. However maternal antibodies are capable of inhibiting subsequent active immunisation against FMD in the piglets even at around 8 weeks after parturition (Kitching and Salt, 1995). Interfering maternal antibodies have also been observed in poultry, inhibiting vaccination against H5N2 influenza virus (Forrest et al., 2013). As dealt with in the rest of the review, other ways of creating antibody based passive immunity is to administer immunoglobulins orally or by injection, thereby controlling the location and the timing of immunoglobulins more precisely.",

In addition to maternal vaccination sometimes being useful for protecting the new-born by maternal antibody transfer as mentioned above a number of other passive immunisation strategies have been studied in humans and/or in models of human diseases (Keller and Stiehm, 2000, Zeitlin et al., 1999). This includes parenteral administration of immunoglobulin preparations for treating and/or preventing influenza (Mancini et al., 2011), plague caused by Yersinia pestis (Froude et al., 2011) and viral haemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola (Qiu et al., 2014)). Passive immunisation is also used to protect against a number of toxins from venomous animals, and bioterror-related toxins (reviewed in (Froude et al., 2011)).",

            "text": "Oral intake of immunoglobulins for oro-gastric protection against enteric infections is well-known in Nature (see above) and this principle has been applied in human medicine for preventing and treating enteric infectious disease. For example, healthy human volunteers given orally colostrum from cows immunised with several E. coli serotypes, fimbria types, E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, and cholera toxin, were all protected against diarrhoea when challenged with E. coli O78:H11 in contrast to 9/10 in a control group receiving non-immune bovine colostrum (Tacket et al., 1988). Although bovine milk contains some antibody reactivity against human rotavirus (Yolken et al., 1985) it appears that hyper-immune colostrum from immunised cows is needed to alleviate disease symptoms in children with rotavirus-induced diarrhoea (Ylitalo et al., 1998). Moreover children diagnosed with rotavirus induced diarrhoea treated with hyper-immune colostrum were less dehydrated and showed better virus clearance than when receiving non-hyper-immune colostrum (Davidson et al., 1989, Sarker et al., 1998). Likewise, HIV patients with Cryptosporidium parvum induced diarrhoea were successfully treated by oral administration of a bovine immunoglobulin concentrate derived from C. parvum immunised cows (Greenberg and Cello, 1996). A general concern associated with oral administration of immunoglobulins is that the protein degrading conditions of the gut may greatly reduce immunoglobulin activity (Jasion and Burnett, 2015). Indeed, the combined action of low pH and proteolytic enzymes has been shown to reduce the virus-neutralising capacity of bovine colostrum immunoglobulins (Petschow and Talbott, 1994). Human milk IgA and IgM appear to be more resistant to proteolysis than IgG as shown e.g. by mass spectrometry (Zhang et al., 2014). The general observation in humans is that up to 25% of IgG passing though the digestive system can afterwards be found intact in stool (Jasion and Burnett, 2015). In study in rabbits that were fed bovine immunoglobulins from Cholera enterotoxin-immunised cows, and the rabbit cecal extract was shown to possess Cholera enterotoxin neutralization ability in vivo (McClead and Gregory, 1984). Intact, non-denatured IgG could also be found throughout the digestive system after oral administration of ovine IgG to rats (Balan et al., 2014). It should be noted that colostrum contains protease inhibitors, such as inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (Danielsen et al., 2011, Hernandez-Castellano et al., 2015). Also, the pH in the stomach of weaned piglets is never below 2.5 (Snoeck et al., 2004), both of which contribute to sustain immunoglobulin stability upon oral administration",

Several PCV2-vaccines have been developed after the millennium and have proved useful for controlling PCV2-associated diseases (Chae, 2012, Kristensen et al., 2011). As it is costly and time-consuming to vaccinate all piglets against PCV2 it would be highly preferable to vaccinate the sows only, i.e. to rely on passive immunity for protection of the piglets. It has indeed been observed that clinical signs of PCV2-infection are reduced in the offspring of vaccinated sows provided maternal anti-PCV2 titres are adequate (Fort et al., 2008, McKeown et al., 2005, Opriessnig et al., 2008), and one commercial sow vaccine has been reported to provide passive immunity in piglets by maternally derived antibodies and lymphocytes (Table 3\n) (Fort et al., 2008, Fort et al., 2009, Oh et al., 2012). On the other hand, vertical transmission of PCV2 may occur even in the face of maternal vaccination (i.e. PCV2 transmitting through milk) (Dvorak et al., 2013, Gerber et al., 2012, Madson et al., 2009, Shibata et al., 2006), and maternal antibodies can potentially impede the piglet immune response to vaccination as seen in a study on oral vaccine against F4+ ETEC (Snoeck et al., 2003). Collectively, it does appear that neither active immunisation nor lactogenic passive immunisation provided by maternal antibody transfer can prevent PCV2 infection even though disease signs are reduced.",

The key step in the pathogenesis of PWD is the fimbria-receptor interaction necessary for the colonisation by ETEC of the small intestine (Gaastra and Svennerholm, 1996, Zhou et al., 2013). An orally provided F4 fimbria subunit vaccine was shown to be able to induce protection against F4 positive ETEC in an experimental model of PWD (Van den Broeck et al., 1999a, Van den Broeck et al., 1999b). One commercial vaccine (Coliprotec\u00ae) for oral use against PWD, containing live avirulent E. coli F4+ strain, has been marketed in Canada for some years (Melkebeek et al., 2013) and was approved for the European market in 2015 as well (EMEA, 2015). Efficacy data for this vaccine do not seem to be available. However, the use of oral vaccines based on live bacteria for oro-gastric protection has several limitations, including (1) in nursing piglets interfering lactogenic maternal antibodies may inhibit induction of active immunity as intestinal colonisation by the bacteria is inhibited, (2) oral vaccination only works fully if the weaners are able to mount a full immune response, which is not the case at four weeks of age (Levast et al., 2014), (3) the vaccine cannot be provided in combination with antibiotics as these will kill the live bacteria of the vaccine, and (4) if the vaccine only provides protection against specific antigens (e.g. F4 fimbriae) it will not work in geographical regions where other bacterial strains prevail (e.g. E. coli F18+). However, passive immunisation was shown to protect new-born piglets against otherwise fatal diarrhoea caused by ETEC F4+ by oral administration of a combination of several monoclonal antibodies targeting different F4 fimbria subunits (25 mg/ml in ascites fluid) (Foged et al., 1986). Notably, one oral dose (1 ml) of this monoclonal antibody mixture provided 1 h prior to challenge did not provide protection, however combining administration before challenge with administration at 8, 24 and 32 h after challenge provided complete protection against mortality and disease. Ten days of feeding genetically engineered Arabidopsis plant seeds expressing F4-specific llama-derived immunoglobulin was reported by Virdi et al., 2013 to reduce excretion of F4 positive ETEC (experimental challenge at day 6) and to increase the weight gain in pigs (Virdi et al., 2013). Antibodies from hens\u2019 eggs (also known as IgY, see below) have also been investigated for their ability to provide passive protection against enteric infections in pigs, however results have been ambiguous (see below). Thus, a study on E. coli F18+-specific IgY-containing egg yolk fed to weaning pigs that had been challenged with virulent E. coli F18+ showed that growth was significantly improved, and both diarrhoea incidence and E. coli colonisation reduced compared to the control groups (Yokoyama et al., 1997). This finding was confirmed in an independent study feeding either egg powder or eggs from fimbria F18-immunised hens to weaning piglets which led to significantly less shedding of the E. coli F18+ challenge strain, reduced incidence of diarrhoea, and reduced mortality compared to weaner piglets fed eggs or egg powder from non-immunised hens (Imberechts et al., 1997). Also, a feed supplement of egg yolk powder from eggs of E. coli F4+-immunised hens decreased the frequency of diarrhoea and mortality in early-weaned piglets to almost zero as compared to a control group not receiving egg yolk feed supplementation (Marquardt et al., 1999, Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2002). On the other hand, other studies failed to demonstrate any effect on experimental E. coli induced diarrhoea incidence after feeding IgY with specificity against the challenge strain (Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003a, Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003b) and a field trial on the efficacy of anti-ETEC IgY did not show any effect on diarrhoea and mortality (Chernysheva et al., 2003).",

However, up to 40% of new-born calves suffer from \u2018Failure of Passive Transfer\u2019 (FPT), defined as failure to attain a serum concentration of IgG of at least 10 g/L within 24\u201328 h after birth (Godden, 2008, Weaver et al., 2000). Poor quality colostrum (low IgG concentration) and inadequate enteral uptake of IgG are the main causes of FPT (Godden, 2008, Quigley, 2002). Calves suffering from FPT show a reduced average daily weight gain and also have an increased risk of mortality within the first 3 months of life (Robison et al., 1988, Wittum and Perino, 1995). In order to prevent FPT, colostrum replacer may be given to the calf just after birth, and several currently marketed products for ruminants apply the passive immunisation principle (Table 4) for helping new-born calves achieve adequate concentrations of circulating immunoglobulins within the first 24 h after birth. E.g. colostrum replacers contain IgG purified from colostrum or plasma in addition to other proteins, fat, vitamins and minerals and provide 100\u2013150 g IgG per 1.5\u20132 l dose (Jones and Heinrichs, 2005) and colostrum replacers can thus prevent FPT.",

This demonstrates proof-of-principle for passive immunisation mediated protection against this E. coli infection; however monoclonal antibodies are not generally available or applicable for passive immunisation of production animals as they are prohibitively expensive. They may have interest as drugs for treating and/or preventing infections in very high price animals, though (thoroughbred and dressage horses, koi carps,\u2014see below). On the other hand, avian immunoglobulin (IgY, see below), in the form of the water-soluble fraction of yolk from eggs of immunised birds has been demonstrated to efficiently reduce ETEC infection in calves as well as in pigs and rabbits (reviewed in (Chalghoumi et al., 2009)), and to provide protection against rotavirus induced diarrhoea in new-born calves (Sarker et al., 2007, Vega et al., 2011) by the enteral route. Also, a number of IgY based calf feed supplements are commercially available (see Table 4).",

Passive immunity obtained by transfer of maternal antibodies in colostrum from ewes vaccinated with extracts of K99 pili from EPEC and with live attenuated Salmonella, respectively has been demonstrated in lambs (Altmann and Mukkur, 1983, Mukkur et al., 1998). Lactogenic immunity against enteric infections with the tapeworm Taenis ovis can also be achieved by vaccination of ewes against the larvae (Rickard et al., 1977). Commercial products using similar maternal vaccination approaches, vaccinating ewes three to four weeks before lambing are available for protection against Clostridium perfringens types C and D infections, lockjaw, lamb dysentery, pulpy kidney, and pasteurellosis (see Table 3). Several of these vaccines can be administered for active immunisation for the offspring as well when the initial, passively mediated protection has waned. Products for direct administration of immunoglobulins for providing passive immunity in sheep against especially Clostridial diseases, but also Tetanus, are listed in Table 4. Collectively, licensed products are typically combination products, targeting a number of different diseases at the same time, increasing cost effectiveness of the invention.",

            "text": "Young chicks have an increased susceptibility to pathogens during the first few weeks after hatching, since their immune system is not fully developed and as maternal immunity is insufficient in providing full protection against certain pathogens. Passive immunity has been investigated extensively in poultry (see Table 5\n), and a number of studies provide positive indications that passive immunisation by the enteral route can be used to prevent and even treat infectious diseases in poultry. The main avian immunoglobulin isotype is IgY and when hatching, the majority of circulating immunoglobulin is constituted by maternal IgY, while in the alimentary tract of the chicken maternal IgA and IgM dominate (Hamal et al., 2006). IgY is functionally similar to mammalian IgG however has four constant domains and no hinge region (reviewed in (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012)). IgY is transferred from the dam to the yolk of the developing egg through the ovarian follicular epithelium (Morrison et al., 2002, Tesar et al., 2008) while avian IgA and IgM are mainly found in the egg white (albumen) transferred in the oviduct through the mucosal secretion (Rose et al., 1974). The amount of IgY transferred to the progeny from the dam is proportional to the IgY serum concentration in the dam; at day 3 the circulatory IgY concentration of the progeny is approximately 30% of that of the dam (Hamal et al., 2006). The level of protection provided by maternally derived IgY varies in different disease models (Table 5, Maternal Protection); in some cases, even though pathogen-reactive IgY was present in both yolk and serum of the hatchling it was still susceptible to experimental infection (Glavits et al., 1991, Le Roy et al., 1995, Lin and Kleven, 1984). On the other hand eight out of ten studies on immunoglobulin transfer in poultry (Table 5, passive transfer) show that antibodies induced by active immunisation of adult birds and then given in the form of antiserum to newly hatched birds protected the recipient birds when challenged by infection.",

Passive immunisation with immunoglobulins from other animal classes has been investigated in various infection models in fish (see Table 6\n). For example, complete protection of Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) against the freshwater protozoan parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis using murine monoclonal immunoglobulins injected intraperitoneally was reported in the study by (Lin et al., 1996) and correlated with circulating murine monoclonal antibody titres against the parasite.

Protection against Paracolo Disease and Vibriosis was obtained in Japanese eels (Gutierrez et al., 1993) and in Plecoglossus altivelis (Ayu) (Li et al., 2014), respectively by oral administration of purified IgY prophylactically in models of these two diseases. On the other hand, studies in Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) provided orally with pathogen-specific IgY in the form of the water-soluble fraction of egg yolk formulated as pellets did not demonstrate full protection against disease in models for Vibriosis and Y. ruckeri infections (Arasteh et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2000). However, full protection was acquired if the Y. ruckeri-specific IgY was provided parenterally (egg yolk) intraperitoneally (Lee et al., 2000), in contrast to the failure of whole antiserum from immune donor fishes to provide protection in the same infection model (see above, (Raida and Buchmann, 2008)). Highly priced ornamental fish (Koi carps) have also been successfully treated with immunoglobulins. Thus, two Nishiki carps diagnosed with a mixed Aeromonas salmonicida and A. hydrophila infection were successfully treated by intramuscular injection with goat antiserum raised against these pathogens three times over three weeks, clearing the infection (Prof. Sasaki Takeji, personal communication), and it was recently published that simply immersing Koi carps in anti\u2014A. salmonicida IgY containing rearing water at 12.5 \u03bcg/ml protected them against skin ulcers and mortality caused by subsequent exposure to this bacterium (Gan et al., 2015), probably by coating the skin of the fish with the IgY antibodies. The fish IgA equivalent IgT could be speculated to be useful for protecting mucosal surfaces and maybe the skin of fish, however no such applications of IgT seem to be reported.",

            "text": "Spray-dried blood plasma (SDP) contains a high concentration of immunoglobulins and is widely used as a feed additive to promote health and growth, especially in the pig production (see Table S1). Documented effects in pigs include increased daily weight gain, improved intestinal health and morphology and improved resistance towards various pathogens (e.g. F4+ ETEC and PCV2) (see Supplementary Table 1) (Bhandari et al., 2008, Hunt et al., 2002, Niewold et al., 2007, Perez-Bosque et al., 2006, Pierce et al., 2005, Quigley and Drew, 2000). It has also been demonstrated in pigs that SDP can protect against experimentally established E. coli colonisation using large amounts of SDP in just weaned pigs, significantly decreasing shedding of the challenge E.coli strain (Nollet et al., 1999). Approximately 20% of SDP dry matter is constituted by immunoglobulin (Pierce et al., 2005, Quigley and Drew, 2000) and it is generally accepted that the beneficial effects of SDP is due to its copious immunoglobulin content. For example, in a study on the effect of different SDP fractions on the performance of early weaned pigs Pierce et al. (2005) demonstrated that the growth promoting effect of SDP resided in the immunoglobulin rich fraction (Pierce et al., 2005). Also, hyperimmune SDP from pigs vaccinated against F4+ ETEC more efficiently reduced shedding of F4+ ETEC in an experimental model of PWD than SDP from non-immunised animals (Niewold et al., 2007). As methods are now in place to efficiently purify immunoglobulin from slaughterhouse pig plasma by very cost-efficient methods (Lihme et al., 2010) it would be attractive to use the purified immunoglobulin fraction itself instead of SDP, and the anti-bacterial effect in experimentally challenged weaning piglets of such a purified immunoglobulin fraction purified in bulk from slaughterhouse blood was demonstrated recently by us (Hedegaard et al., 2016). The slaughterhouse pig plasma was shown to contain \u2018natural\u2019 antibody activity against both E. coli and Salmonella enterica spp (Hedegaard et al., 2016). Unfractionated blood products, such as SPD may harbour viral pathogens. For example, PEDV has been suggested to be present in porcine SDP (Pasick et al., 2014) although the heat treatment which is part of the spray-drying process may partly inactivate it (Gerber et al., 2014). Also, porcine parvovirus in liquid plasma has been shown to be inactivated by ultraviolet light irradiation (Polo et al., 2015). Anyhow, purification of immunoglobulin has the added benefit of allowing the removal of blood borne pathogens, including viruses, such as PCV2 and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV).",

IgY with specific binding activity can be obtained by vaccination of egg-laying hens which will then deliver eggs with high antibody titres against the target antigen (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012). Such IgY antibodies have shown potential for treating/preventing diseases in both humans and animals (reviewed in (Chalghoumi et al., 2009, Diraviyam et al., 2014, Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012), also see above). Notably, IgY does not bind mammalian complement factors and Fc-receptors making its use in mammals relatively uncomplicated (Inoue et al., 2015, Larsson et al., 1991). As expected, if IgY was provided parenterally to mammals a host immune response towards IgY was observed (Diaz et al., 2014).

The major immunoglobulin type in bovine milk and colostrum is IgG (0.5\u20131 mg/ml and 60\u201370 mg/ml, respectively) (El-Loly, 2007, Hurley and Theil, 2011). Precipitating casein from milk, as done in cheese manufacturing, removes the bulk of protein from the milk, leaving the by-product whey, containing around 0.5 mg/ml IgG, constituting approx. 10% of the protein fraction (Siso, 1996). In cattle, a marketed whey-product (Colostrx) is claimed to protect similarly to colostrum against ETEC in a E. coli K99-challenge model (Harman et al., 1991). Although whey is claimed to have a range of dietary benefits in humans (Marshall, 2004, Patel, 2015) and pigs (Vanavichial, 1998), and it is a cheaper source of immunoglobulins than milk, it however does not seem that whey is used to any discernible degree for production of purified immunoglobulin preparations. This may be due to the relatively low concentration of IgG in whey (<1 mg/ml) necessitating large volumes to be handled during purification thereby compromising economic feasibility compared to e.g. blood serum (containing around 10 mg/ml).",

            "text": "Intensive animal production systems generally face challenges in the shape of infections compromising productivity, economy and animal welfare, and causing extensive use of antibiotics. Active immunisation (vaccination) is a very useful alternative and supplement to antibiotics for protecting against infectious pathogens as it can be used to target different types of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and as problems of microbial resistance is rarely a problem. However vaccines come with their own set of challenges, including their cost, and lack of efficiency in very young animals with a less developed immune system, with enteric infections and with multifactorial infectious disease, all of which characterize some of the most common infection related diseases in production animals. This among others include weaning diarrhoea and neonatal diarrhoea in pigs, diarrhoea in young calves, and a host of bacterial infections in fish fry as well as the more specialized example of skin infections in high price Koi carps especially associated with transport and co-mingling stress. As described in this review the passive immunisation principle lends itself to meet the specific need for efficient, inexpensive and non-antibiotics based intervention against these types of disease problems. Numerous examples in all of the common production animals on the efficiency of administered antibodies to combat or prevent infections are found in the scientific literature (see above), underlining the fact that immunoglobulins, administered in numerous ways and not very dependent on their source can provide short term \u2018traceless\u2019 protection against infection.",

Although a range of advanced methods for producing immunoglobulins including monoclonal antibody protocols and recombinant antibody expression exist, such types of immunoglobulins are not expected to be prime candidates for large scale use in intensive animal production systems. Also, in practical terms easy administration of immunoglobulins is a must. For example, instead of injecting all fry in a fish production unit it would be much more practical to provide antibodies in the fry feed. Another example is the administration of colostrum feed supplements in which antibodies derived from the dam provide protection against infectious agents in the suckling offspring (see Table 4), and the provision of immunoglobulin-containing egg yolk powder as a feed supplement to reduce enteric infections e.g. in weaner piglets.",
