Since IB pathogenesis is characterized by respiratory symptoms that often lead to complex infections and secondary bacterial disease, IB is an important concern for the poultry industry (Abd El Rahman et al., 2010; De Wit et al., 2017). Though both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are widely used to control IBV, outbreaks occasionally occur in endemic areas (Mase et al., 2010; Dhama et al., 2014). Several strategies, including use of powerful adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity, optimizing delivery methods, selecting appropriate immunization routes, and targeting effective antigen presentation have been employed to improve the efficacy of the IBV vaccine (Wang et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Zeshan et al., 2011).",

Then, 100 \u00b5L of the diluted cytokine standard, 100 \u00b5L of the sample, and 50 \u00b5L of the working detection antibody (Anti-Chicken IFN-\u03b3 Biotin; 0.031 mg/0.2 mL) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing five times, 100 \u00b5L of the working streptavidin-HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase) solution was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The plates were washed five times, and 100 \u00b5L of Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added to each well. After incubation in the dark for 20 min, 100 \u00b5L of stop solution (2 mol/L H2SO4) was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an automatic ELISA reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). Standard curves were drawn, and the concentration of cytokines in each well was calculated with respect to the standards. Each serum sample was tested in duplicate.",

PD is a potential less-hemolytic saponin adjuvant isolated from the root of P. grandiflorum. PD treatment was shown to significantly enhance specific antibody and cellular responses in mice, and simultaneously elicit a Th1 and Th2 immune response (Sun et al., 2011). Here, PD was used as an adjuvant. We evaluated how effectively PD induced immunity and protected chickens against IBV challenge. As expected, treatment with PD plus the inactivated IBV H120 antigen resulted in a higher IBV-specific antibody titer, greater T cell proliferation, and more robust protection against mortality.

Vaccination induces cell-mediated responses by promoting lymphocyte proliferation and increasing cytokine production (Oliveira et al., 2016). The cytokine profile induced by an immune adjuvant plays an important role in the polarization of immune responses (Gan et al., 2019). Chicken IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages, increases the expression levels of major histocompatibility complex I and II antigens in various cell types, and neutralizes viral replication (Janardhana et al., 2007; Kano et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2017). Our proliferation assay indicated that PD treatment significantly increased lymphocyte proliferation in immunized chickens. In addition, PD treatment significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 concentration in the culture supernatants. These results indicated that PD treatment enhanced T and B lymphocyte activation, and induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in chickens. In addition, co-immunization with PD led to the secretion of the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3, suggesting that immunized chickens were able to elicit an adaptive immune response by synthesizing T cells and improving cell-mediated immunity.",

In this study, HI was used for the detection of IBV humoral antibodies, as HI antibody levels are commonly used as indicators of protection inactive vaccine (Katz and Kohn 1976). Indeed, HI antibody levels are typically used to monitor the antibody response induced by an IBV vaccine (Awad et al., 2015). Therefore, HI titer was an important factor for the assessment of vaccine adjuvant performance. Our results indicated that the mean HI antibody titer production was dependent on the PD concentration when injected intramuscular injection (i.m.)

Immune response analysis indicated that viral challenge elicited a strong immune response and enhanced the protection rate in the PD-treated groups. These results suggest that use of PD as an adjuvant might increase protection against IBV. The enhancement of immune responses with the PD adjuvant was slightly higher than that with the Al(OH)3 adjuvant, there by suggesting that PD can be used as an adjuvant in IBV vaccines, and it might provide better protection against IBV by stimulating both the humoral and cellular immune responses. Hence, these findings may have important implications in the design of IBV vaccine adjuvants.",
