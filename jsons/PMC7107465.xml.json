Allantoic fluid was harvested from eggs that died 3\u20134 d postinoculation. Titration of the virus was accomplished by preparation of 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and inoculation of 0.2 ml of each dilution onto confluent monolayers of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in 48-well tissue culture plates, four wells per dilution. Five days after inoculation, contents of wells were decanted into a container containing sodium hypochlorite to inactivate live virus, and cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Titer was determined by calculation of the 50% infectious doses (ID50) as described by Reed and Muench (1938).

The current study demonstrates the potential of the house fly to harbor NDV in the crop and gut tissues, and it confirms the findings of Milushev et al. (1977). Virus was detectible in the fly crop for 96 h after a single feeding event. Virus titers in pooled fly crops ranged from 103 ID50 measured within 30 min of feeding on NDV inoculum to <101 ID50 at 96 h. Although NDV titers in pooled mid- and hindgut tissues were higher (107 ID50/0.2 ml) immediately after a single feeding, live virus was only detectable for 24 h. The starting NDV dose was \u2248107 ID50 for both experiment 1 and 2. It is interesting that the crop had much less virus at 30 min than the gut, suggesting that the flies directed a significant portion of the virus containing medium directly to the gut in response to periods of food deprivation. In a previous study, we found turkey coronavirus (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, TCV) remained active in the crop of the house fly for 9 h, but it was inactivated in the gut (Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003). It is likely that midgut proteolytic enzymes inactivate NDV within 24 h and similar enzymes are not present in the crop where the virus may be active longer. As with TCV, the current study indicates that the house fly is a mechanical vector of NDV. The decrease in virus titers indicates that the house fly is not a propagative vector of NDV.",

These findings suggest that NDV transmission, in the current study, failed because chicks failed to ingest an adequate quantity of virus-laden flies; based on calculations chicks would have needed to consume >33 flies to reach a sufficient dose for infection by the oral route. However, intranasal inoculation at 104 ID50 infected 100% of the chicks. Although the house fly did not transmit NDV in our study, the potential to mechanically transmit NDV remains a possibility because NDV was detectable in both crop and gut tissues for up to 96 and 24 h, respectively, postfeeding (Tables 1 and 2).",

Velogenic forms of the virus are most virulent and cause the greatest mortality, whereas virulent mesogenic forms may cause mortality, and lentogenic forms are generally nonfatal. Live vaccines are usually developed from lentogenic and mesogenic strains and include Mukteswar (mesogenic), Roakin (mesogenic), and La Sota (lentogenic), among others (Alexander 1991). Accordingly, lentogenic vaccines may be administered intranasally and mesogenic vaccines intramuscularly. As with field strains of avian viruses, the virulence of NDV viruses may have bearing on vector competency studies, and virulent velogenic ND may be more amenable to fly transmission at lower doses.",

In controlled experiments, NDV-exposed house flies did not transmit NDV even though each fly carried \u2248104 ID50 of virus when placed in contact with susceptible chickens. This was unexpected, because NDV-exposed flies were eaten by contact chickens soon after placement in isolation units. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated a dose effect for NDV Roakin: an ID50 \u2265106 was required to infect chickens by the oral route, the likely route of transmission for NDV by flies. These studies indicate that at least for NDV Roakin, house flies did not carry sufficient quantities of virus to infect chickens and are unlikely vectors. Additional studies using other NDV strains, particularly velogenic strains, are needed to definitively determine the role of house flies as vectors of NDV.",
