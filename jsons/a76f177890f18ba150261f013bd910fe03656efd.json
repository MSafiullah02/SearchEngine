Methods Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing were obtained. Results Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence. The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8-24 days) and 21.5 days (10-36 days), respectively. The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (n=16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2-20 days]) and patients with typical groundglass or patchy opacities on CT(n=10, 38.5%; 12.5 days[8-22 days]; P<0.01). Seven patients (70.0%) with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved CT findings.",

For instance, there are reports documenting a substantial fraction of truly asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship (approximately 18%) and Japanese evacuees out of Wuhan [4, 5] . There are a few other case reports in various journals in Table 1 [3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These reports mainly focus on the estimated asymptomatic proportion, mode of transmission, some radiological findings, and solutions to identify and isolate asymptomatic patients. Emerging evidence suggests that patients with clinical manifestations are contagious, with analysis of their clinical characteristics [11, 12] . However, there are few studies reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients. A few studies have described the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients, but some of the asymptomatic patients in these studies were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis but later developed symptoms, so they cannot truly represent the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients [13, 14] . Here, we identified a total of 26 persistently asymptomatic patients with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid to determine the clinical characteristics and asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19 infection.",
