            "text": "The prediction of chemical solute transport behavior in porous media is of great importance in a wide range of engineering applications. To this end, a significant number of numerical transport models have been developed. Typically, these are coupled models that consider advection and hydrodynamic dispersion, the latter of which comprises both mechanical dispersion and self\u2010diffusion1 of the chemical species coupled with heat flow and, often, the mechanical behavior of the medium. In addition to these flow and deformation processes, the solute can also be considered to be either reactive or nonreactive depending on the nature of the problem considered.",

            "text": "One of the major disadvantages of these models is that they can become computationally expensive when the chemical system becomes relatively large. Cleall et al23 suggest that the magnitude of a problem is governed by three main aspects, namely, the domain size, timescale, and the complexity of the analysis, which includes the number of variables, the degree of coupling between them, the number of processes considered, and the degree of nonlinearity of the system. The degree of nonlinearity depends on the underlying physical processes; for example, the system will be highly nonlinear if the reactions are sensitive to small changes in concentration or the permeability of the porous medium is sensitive to the degree of saturation. To deal with this issue, several techniques have been proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the associated solution process, including \u201coperator splitting\u201d techniques and reformulation of the coupled system. Operator splitting divides or \u201csplits\u201d a time step into a transport calculation and a reaction calculation, to be solved sequentially, with many models iterating between the two. This is an approximation of the time integral of the governing equation,24 which therefore changes the numerical framework from a global implicit approach to a sequential iterative or a sequential non\u2010iterative approach. Such calculation splitting methods have been found to reduce the computational cost25 and have been used by many authors.2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 A disadvantage of the sequential non\u2010iterative approach is its propensity to introduce splitting errors (for example, mass balance errors), whereas the sequential iterative approach tends to require prohibitively small time steps and a relatively large number of iterations to achieve convergence.26, 27 Consequentially, these operator splitting approaches have been found to increase computational demand for certain \u201cchemically difficult\u201d cases (for example, cases with high kinetic reaction rates).27, 28\n",

Most studies have focused on reformulating the system by decoupling a number of the partial differential equations (PDEs) and eliminating certain local (spatially invariant) equations, including both ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations.26, 27, 29, 30, 31 A common assumption used in such formulations is that all chemical species have the same diffusion coefficient.26, 27 This has been justified by the fact that predicted responses are relatively insensitive to differences in diffusion constants because mechanical dispersion is normally the dominant transport mechanism.27 An alternative view was expressed by Thomas et al,10 who suggested that this assumption is not valid for some chemical systems. The presence of minerals, whose concentrations can reach zero, may also cause issues when such schemes are used,26 although Kr\u00e4utle and Knabner26 have introduced a moving boundary condition (BC) and a complimentary function to alleviate these difficulties.",

            "text": "The reduction in computational demand that can be achieved by the operator splitting and reformulation approaches described above is often limited by the chemistry of a problem; for example, only limited reductions are possible when a large number of kinetic reactions with high reaction rates are considered. To address this issue, an indicator\u2010based multi\u2010order problem reduction scheme (PRS) is proposed, which allows for greater reduction in problem size that is independent of the nature of reactions and which explicitly considers species\u2010dependent diffusion coefficients. The scheme works by decoupling a number of the nonlinear PDEs from the global system of equations. In this new PRS, a small number of indicator species (\u2264 3) are selected for full computation, and then, on a stepwise basis, the response of other species is inferred from these indicators using a predictor\u2010corrector approach. The reduction in computational demand is achieved through the reduction in size of the nonlinear global system of equations and by the replacement of nonlinear PDEs with stepwise predictor\u2010corrector computations for non\u2010indicator species. Three different orders of the PRS are considered, each applicable to different chemical systems. The new PRS is presented along with a study to establish the range of applicability of each order considered. This is followed by a set of validation examples in which the reactive transport of chemical species through mortar and concrete specimens is simulated.",

For PRS2, which requires a third indicator species, it was found, following an error analysis and sensitivity study (see Section 6.2), that the greatest accuracy was achieved by using a third indicator species with a mean diffusion coefficient. In cases where such a real species is not available, artificial species can be used. Artificial indicator species may also be used for other reasons; for example, as mentioned above, PRS1 and PRS2 use indicator species with the highest and lowest diffusion coefficients. However, the presence of any reactions associated with one of the bounding species, with reaction rates of the same order as (or higher than) those of the transport processes, may alter its rate of transport, such that it may no longer be the highest/lowest. In such situations, a nonreactive artificial indicator should be used in its place, thereby maintaining the solution bound.

It can be seen from Table 14 that the implementation of the reduction scheme does not increase the number of Newton iterations required per time step. Table 14 also shows that the reduction in computational cost achieved by the scheme is a result of reducing the size of the nonlinear system through the reduction of the number of coupled nonlinear PDEs to be solved, as opposed to reducing the nonlinearity of the PDEs or improving the convergence of the Newton\u2010Raphson procedure. The nature of the predictor\u2010corrector approach (Equations (40) and (41)) makes this part of the model readily parallelizable, and, in addition to this, the model is compatible with domain decomposition methods, both of which would reduce the computational cost further.",

In the present case, the authors considered isothermal problems and have used a single degree of freedom (P\nc) to simulate moisture flow, whereas Gawin et al32 employed two degrees of freedom in their moisture transport model. The authors expect that the reduction gained, relative to a full model solution, from reducing the number of chemical species that are primary variables would be different if a temperature\u2010dependent two\u2010variable moisture model had been used. However, we believe that the use of the PRS will always result in a substantial reduction in CPU time (for any practical engineering problem) when the number of primary chemical species is reduced significantly.",
