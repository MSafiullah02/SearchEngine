Anti-influenza drugs currently used in the clinic include influenza virus matrix protein M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir) (Pawestri et al. 2018; Pires de Mello et al. 2018), and RNA polymerase inhibitors (ribavirin) (De Clercq 2006). However, the toxicity and side effects of long-term and large-scale use of anti-influenza drugs and their resistance to viruses have attracted much attention (Choi et al. 2009). NA inhibitor, oseltamivir, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of influenza and oseltamivir-resistant IAV emerge frequently (Kiso et al. 2010; Liao et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Polygala (P.) japonica herba, a traditional Chinese herb, has been used as an expectorant, antitussive, antibacterial, and ataractic agent (Zhang et al. 1996). It is widely used in China to treat acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections in children (Zhou et al. 2015). The compounds isolated from P. japonica so far mainly include saponins, flavonoids, xanthones, polysaccharides, etc. Saponins are one of the key components of P. japonica (Fu et al., 2008). These activities may be due to the presence of various saponins in P. japonica, since studies have showed that the saponins found in P. japonica have antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant effects (Chung et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2008). Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C53H86O23, Fig. 1) is a triterpenoid saponin and is also one of the major active constituents of P. japonica used for the quality control of the medicine (Zhou et al. 2015). Previous research has reported that PSF has anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Wei et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2008). Inflammation is associated with influenza. Importantly, hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. When infected by influenza virus, the cytokines will be duplicated with the support of various cell-signaling pathways such as the changes in Raf/MEK/ERK, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) induced by IAV (Ehrhardt et al. 2006). Therefore, a reduction in cytokine expression and viral replications by interfering the signaling events is considered as a beneficial method to treat IAV infections. PSF has an important role in anti-inflammatory activity and inhibition of (NF)-\u03baB (Yan et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2014). PSF may also have the potential to treat pneumonia induced by IAV. This study was designed to investigate whether PSF could provide protection against pneumonia caused by influenza virus. The mechanisms of PSF anti-influenza virus using high-throughput proteome array and western blotting were also discussed.",

In this study, PSF-treated mice had lower histopathology scores in the lung, showing that PSF might reduce the occurrence rate of pulmonary edema and relieve lung inflammation induced by influenza virus. In addition, PSF could inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-\u03b1), and thus suppress the inflammatory responses in the tissues and cells (Yan et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2008). Our data show that influenza virus would significantly raise the IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the lung tissue and the use of PSF could reduce the up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines. Besides, PSF could inhibit inflammation in the lung tissues and suppress excessive innate inflammatory responses, so that to protect mice infected with IAV from further damages.",

The lung index and pulmonary vascular permeability appeared to progressively increase, suggesting that the increase of pulmonary vascular permeability is one of the early lesions. In the IAV-C group and the PSF treatment group, lung TXA2 and PGE2 levels showed a synchronous change trend with pulmonary vascular permeability, lung index, and lung pathological changes, suggesting that lung damage caused by IAV was closely related to the production of TXA2 and PGE2. Prostaglandins [PGs, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGD2, PGF2\u03b1, PGI2, TXA2] are bioactive lipid mediators generated from arachidonic acid via the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenases (COXs) and participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease (Park et al. 2006; Davies et al. 1984). TXA2 is by far the strongest platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle (van Ooijen et al. 1990). TXA2 constricts pulmonary vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, promotes platelet aggregation and secretion, and aggravates lung injury. In addition, TXA2 can mediate the adhesion and aggregation of neutrophils, release harmful factors such as oxygen free radicals, leukotrienes, and platelet activating factors, thus aggravating lung damage (Westphal et al. 2005). PGE2 is the most abundant prostanoid in the mammalian body and plays a role in regulation of immune responses, blood pressure, gastrointestinal integrity, and inflammation (Coulombe and Divangahi 2014). PGE2 acts as a mediator of pain and fever in inflammatory response and participates in the pathophysiological process of inflammation. All the classic signs of inflammation (swelling, redness, heat, and pain) can be attributed to PGE2 (Funk 2001). IAV hyper induces the COX-2 and PGE2 production (Liu et al. 2012). In this study, PSF can inhibit the release of TXA2 and PGE2 to a certain extent, thereby effectively alleviate the inflammatory response, which may be one of the mechanisms of anti-influenza effect of PSF. Our study showed that even if the viral replication have been suppressed in the mice treated with oseltamivir, levels of TXA2 and PGE2 were still similar to the IAV-C mice, which were significantly higher than those in the mice receiving PSF therapy. This finding suggests that once the viral infection has triggered the cytokine storm, inflammatory cytokines will continue to drive the immunopathologic progression (Zheng et al. 2008) and antiviral therapy cannot completely inhibit this process.",

As the main regulator of influenza cytokines and chemokines production (e.g. TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, IL-1 \u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3), the activation of NF-\u03baB is a hallmark of host cells responding to influenza virus infection (Barnes and Karin 1997). Overexpression of IAV-induced cytokines and chemokines is subjected to the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Barnes and Karin 1997). The activation and inactivation of NF-\u03baB could directly regulate the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion factors such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Chu et al. 1999). These cytokines and adhesion factors are considered to have connection with acute lung injury (ALI) (Lee et al. 2005). As previously studied, the nuclear translocation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB -dependent transcriptional activity can be inhibited by treating with PSF (Yan et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2014). The expression of NF-\u03baB p65 (major component of NF-\u03baB) and MEK1 had a significant decrease in the lung of IAV-infected mice after treated with PSF. PSF could inhibit signaling by Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-KappaB, which would interfere with the events and suppress virus production and inflammatory responses.",

Triterpenoid saponins from the roots of P. japonica Houtt. have anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of nitrite and PGE2 production, iNOS and, COX-2 protein expression and TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12 mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells (Kim et al. 2009; Ahn et al. 2005). Previous research has reported that PSF inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS and its mechanism is associated with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Wei et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015), but the effect and mechanism vary in different conditions. This study demonstrated that PSF can block the production of cytokines and prostaglandins and inhibit viral pneumonia in mice infected with IAV, and its mechanism is associated with the suppression of Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-\u03baB expressions, which may support the utility of P. japonica in respiratory infection, especially IAV-induced pneumonia.",

Influenza virus infection triggers the cytokine storm and includes following hallmarks: excessive proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory cells recruitment into lungs (La Gruta et al. 2007). Drugs with anti-inflammatory actions have controlled excessive inflammation from severe influenza in animal models such as the COX-2 inhibitor, naproxen (Lejal et al. 2013). This finding suggests that viral replication is suppressed by oseltamivir, but the immunopathologic progression is not completely suppressed.
