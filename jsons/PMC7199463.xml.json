One arm of the Y determined the direction of movement while the other moved posteriorly and could be resorbed (Fig. 3). In some cases the arm moving posteriorly was not resorbed but changed into a bifurcated hyaline zone that determined a new direction of movement (Fig. 3). When this happened, the direction of movement was usually shifted approximately 90\u00b0. In cultures with high bacterial densities, attached cells often produced a single, long, unattached finger\u2010 like pseudopodium (dactylopodium; Page 1981), as long as or longer than the main body mass. These dactylopodia could freely move horizontally or vertically (Fig. 4). Differentiated uro\u2010 idal structures were absent.",

The columns were 100\u2013200 nm long, longer at the apices and shorter along the sides. They supported a narrow perforated rim, around 20 nm wide and slightly protruding from the column supports at each end (Fig. 13).
