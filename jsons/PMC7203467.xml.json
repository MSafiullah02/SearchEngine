            "text": "The COVID19 pandemic has put to test the capacity of vaccinology to produce as fast as possible relevant vaccines. A number of recent reports predict possible SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine development but there are no reports on experimentally defined B cell epitopes (1\u20135). The closest to identification of actual epitopes is the finding of pentapeptide sequences from the viral proteome in other known epitopes form IEDB (5). A library of 224,087 mimotopes corresponding to the human public IgM repertoire as represented in a plasma pool from 10,000 healthy donors was recently designed (6). The mimotopes were selected from a commercial 7 amino acid random peptide phage display library (Ph.D. 7, New England Biolabs). Conceptually, this mimotope library reflects at a certain level of detail, the repertoire of IgM specificities in the plasma focusing on the recurring ones. The latter can be just natural antibodies or they may represent the product of fast extrafollicularly expanding IgM clones that may serve as precursors of highly specific, somatically mutated, class-switched B cells. The preimmune repertoire has to be quasi-complete to provide for rapid expansion of clones reactive with any newly encountered antigen. The same may not be true for our library although, due to the polyspecific binding, most of the available public repertoire may be partially represented in it (6). Here we report that the IgM mimotope library contains heptapeptides identical to peptides in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. One of them may serve as a potentially neutralizing epitope on the spike protein.",

The Expect value (E) is a parameter that describes the number of hits one can \u201cexpect\u201d to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size. Essentially, the E value describes the random background noise (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=FAQ#expect). The E value of search results with so short sequences is very high and the mere number of sequences is not statistically significant. Yet, this does not refute the fact that 3 heptapeptides which are operationally defined mimotopes of human preimmune antibodies, are part of the viral proteome and, thus, represent (parts of) possible epitopes. On the other hand, the mimotopes in the database sometimes form non-random clusters of homologous sequences much like the mimotopes selected by a single monoclonal antibody. Each one among 224,087 randomly selected heptamers should have on the average 1.33 homologous sequences in that same database that differ from it by up to 2 mismatches. As seen from Table 1, all SARS sequences but not those from trivial HCoV were members of clusters significantly greater than random (Binomial test, p < 0.05, false discovery rate adjusted). This is an indication that the presence of these sequences is non-random and they represent clusters of mimotopes representing well-represented individual (poly)specificities.",

The relative solvent exposed surface greatly exceeds the threshold of 5% for participating in contacts (Figure 1B). This loop is adjacent to the loop representing the epitope of the neutralizing antibody LCA60 on the SARS-CoV spike (8, 9). Presumably, it is similarly exposed further in the open conformation of the spike domains. The adjacent N-glycosylation sites are N165 and N234.

Both are on tumor associated antigens (10, 11). While TGM4 is an intracellular antigen, mucin-16 is highly accessible on cell surfaces and in a soluble form. The mucin sequence 462TTLDSKI468 is T/S biased, represents part of the highly O-glycosylated N-terminal part of mucin-16 and is predicted to be O-glycosylated itself. Normally, such mucin protein core epitopes are occluded by glycosylation and thus, cryptic with respect to immune tolerance.

Similarly, the IgM igome contained sequences found also in SARS-CoV, although the epidemic was too restricted to be reflected in the antibody repertoires of the donors (Table 1). Furthermore, no signs of persistent antibody titers after exposure were observed. The representation of clones reactive with the trivial human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 was rather narrower than that of the unknown strains. Some of the epitopes were conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (AQTGIAV and TKGPHEF) but they were found in non-structural proteins and are hardly targets for neutralizing antibodies (Table 1). On the other hand, all potential epitopes found could play a role in targeting the viral proteins to specific B1 cells which produce the bulk of natural IgM. The latter are known to be excellent antigen presenting cells able to prime CD4+ T cells, and initiate Th1 immune responses (16\u201318) in antigen specific manner much like activated specific B2 cells (17). It has been shown that B1 cells secreted IgM is a non-redundant and essential arm of the humoral responses to influenza in mice (19). This implies that natural antibody epitopes might be essential components of subunit vaccines even though they may not represent typical dominant epitopes. The role of overlapping T and B cell epitopes is not clear except when the B cell receptor has a high enough affinity for the epitope to protect it during processing (20), but it is interesting that one of the SARS-CoV natural epitopes (922TTSTALG928) is also part of a CD4 T cell epitope in the context of HLA-DR B1*04:01 (21). Using the IEDB preferred method the epitope 108TTLDSKT114 is predicted to overlap a potential class II epitope in the context of HLA-DRB1*07:01, while two other potential epitopes just up- and downstream overlap it partially (in the context of HLA-DPA1*02:01/DPB1*01:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*04:05 and HLA-DRB1*13:02, respectively). In this respect, maybe a more useful epitope would be the continuous sequence 99NIIRGWIFGTTLDSKTQSLLIVNNATNV126.",

The preimmune IgM mimotopes we describe could represent also epitopes of na\u00efve B cell clones which may have undergone extrafollicular expansion poised to initiate also follicular immune responses. As to the capacity of these epitopes to induce fully mature antibody response, it is interesting to note that the two preimmune IgM epitopes found for the spike of SARS-CoV (922TTSTALG928 and 389VKGDDVR395) are proven antibody targets in approximately one fourth of the SARS patients (7). Thus, our mimotope library has the capacity to identify potential true precursor epitopes and not only natural antibody epitopes. Furthermore, a recent report indicates the importance of IgM antibodies in the control of the diseases in mild cases of COVID19 (23). Thus, it is quite possible that the SARS-CoV-2 spike epitope TTLDSKT is bound by B cells that will contribute to the induced immune response.",
