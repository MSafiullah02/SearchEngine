            "text": "Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome disorder1 with a birth prevalence estimated at 1.5 per 1,0002 and approximately 5,000 children are born with DS in the United States each year3. Similarly, a previous regional survey of Japan reported a prevalence of 1.5 per 1,000 live births4. Patients with DS frequently have associated developmental disorders and about 40% of children with DS are born with congenital heart disease (CHD)5, leading to higher mortality rates. Although many of these malformations can be surgically corrected, DS patients face additional risks such as airway obstruction while under sedation6. Recently, pharmacological interactions of dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly selective\u03b12-adrenergic agonist, with DS patients were shown to result in more side effects7. Additionally, benzodiazepine (BDZ), which increases GABAA receptor-mediated chloride ion influx, is thought to engender pharmaco-resistance in DS patients due to altered GABAergic transmission in area CA18 as seen in murine models. The manifestation of this effect has been clinically seen in case reports showing resistance to BDZ-class anesthesia midazolam (MDZ) in DS patients, such as dental surgery in a 35-year-old DS patient that required 3.5 mg MDZ before local anesthesia9. However, statistical confirmation of this effect in DS patients remains elusive10. Therefore, this study was conducted under the hypothesis that MDZ sedative effect is lessened in DS patients and aimed to use a sufficient sample size to discover the impact of MDZ resistance in pediatric surgery.",

Patients were excluded if they had other trisomy, stroke, epilepsy and/or PICU stays of less than 5 days after the end of muscle relaxant usage. We recorded patient information, including age, sex, surgical procedure, and daily severity data (including severity of organ dysfunction and sedative/muscle relaxant dosages) during PICU stays for five days after the end of muscle relaxant usage. In our practice, we use muscle relaxants and sedation in cases of severe cardiac failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additional instances would be whenever careful control is needed for a stressed right ventricle (such as for the Fontan procedure) and/or to prevent fighting the ventilator and reduce oxygen consumption. We also use muscle relaxants and sedation for high airway resistance patients, but all uses of relaxants and sedation are carefully monitored and weaning is judged on both a daily and case-by-case basis. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Tsukuba approved the study (Approval #H29-134).",

Sedation was assessed by using the State Behavioral Scale (SBS)15, which scores sedation status over a range of \u22123 (unresponsive) to +2 (agitation), and is widely used in the pediatric critical care field as a sedation indicator16. Daily severity of organ dysfunction was evaluated by PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score (PELOD-2)17. PELOD-2 consists of ten variables corresponding to five organ dysfunctions and daily assessment allows for prediction of outcome in critically ill children18.",

However, muscle relaxants are ordinarily used after cardiac operations to avoid negative hemodynamic effects and this may mask both sedation status and pharmaco-resistance to sedatives. However, excluding muscle relaxant usage days would cause lead time bias and possible overestimation of the outcome19,20. Thus, we used muscle relaxant days as a covariate for the multi-regression modeling to mediate the bias in addition to a five-day post-usage period in our analysis. For adjustment of our model, additional covariates were chosen a priori: sex, age, RACHS-1, dose of dexmedetomidine, vecuronium dosage status (received/not received) and PELOD-2 (without the central nervous system component). To adjust patient demographic characteristics, we chose sex and age as covariates. RACHS-1 was used to adjust operation severity and PELOD-2 (without the central nervous system component) was used to adjust post-surgical daily severity. As our institute mainly uses dexmedetomidine as MDZ alternatives for sedation, we chose dosages of this as covariate factors.",

As regression modeling assumes independence for each factor, we suspected that Down syndrome and MDZ dosage were not independent of each other and the magnitude (quantitative interaction) of MDZ effect would change based on DS status. Thus, we used a two-step system in which we calculated main effect (model 1) then proceeded to interaction modeling (model 2). We also applied an interaction methodology for DEX (model 3) as a control for midazolam pharmaco-resistance to sedation. In interaction models (model 2, 3) the odds ratio of the main effect (Down syndrome and midazolam; Down syndrome and dexmedetomidine) was not significant, possibly due to the ability to capture only a segment of the main effect.",

To deal with population outliers in pharmaco-resistance studies, Bayesian modeling23,24 and Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been reported25,26. Therefore, we applied Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling, or Bayesian inference for GLMM using No-U-turn sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method27. We used uninformative prior distribution as our prior distribution and all iterations were set to 2,000, burn-in samples were set to 1,000 and the number of chains was set to 4. To check the modeling assumption, we used the value of Rhat, Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE)/standard deviation (sd), and effective sample size (Neff)/numbers (N). An MCSE/sd less than 10%, a Neff/N more than 10%, and a Rhat for all parameters less than 1.128 indicated a good estimation for the model. We report the 95% percentile interval as a 95% credible interval (Crl). We also report the probability for supporting the hypothesis as greater or less than another group in univariate analysis.",

Average age of the total population was 26 (\u00b1 40) weeks and DS patients had a high probability to be younger than normal patients (12 \u00b1 22 weeks vs. 28 \u00b1 42 weeks, respectively; probability of the DS group mean was greater than normal = 0.93) while muscle relaxant days had a high probability to be longer for DS patients (3 days in DS vs 0 days in controls; probability of the DS group\u2019s days were greater than normal = 0.97). RACHS-1 scores were almost identical in the DS patients compared with normal patients (2 in DS vs 2 in controls; probability of the DS group\u2019s severity was greater than normal = 0.13) and PELOD-2 found that DS patients had a higher probability to be younger than normal patients (5.6 \u00b1 1.9 in DS vs. 4.1 \u00b1 1.8 in controls; probability of DS group severity was greater than normal = 0.99). Depth of sedation was one area where DS patients did not have a high probability compared with normal patients over the study period (\u22121 in DS vs \u22121 in controls; probability of DS group mean was greater than normal = 0.35) but DS patients had a high probability of receiving significantly higher doses of midazolam, dexmedetomidine and Fentanyl (midazolam: 3.5 mg/kg/day in DS vs. 1.6 mg/kg/day in control, probability of DS group mean was greater than normal = 0.99; dexmedetomidine:11.7 \u03bcg/kg/day in DS vs. 7.6 \u03bcg/kg/day in control, probability of DS group mean was greater than normal = 0.99; Fentanyl: 0.9 mg/kg/day in DS vs. 0.1 mg/kg/day in control, probability of DS group mean was greater than normal = 0.99). Figure 2 presents the relationship between operation risk score as measured by RACHES-1 and sedative dosage amounts. Category 1 operations tended to not differ in total amounts of sedative, but Category 2 and Category 3 had a high probability that DS patients would need a higher total amount of sedative (the probability of the DS group dosage of midazolam was greater than normal: Category 1 = 0.57, Category 2 = 0.99, Category 3 = 0.98; the probability of the DS group dosage of dexmedetoimidine was greater than normal: Category 1 = 0.84, Category 2 = 0.95,Category 3 = 0.92).",

            "text": "Pediatric heart surgery is a complex process complicated by DS. Although some studies showed no differences in mortality between DS and normal pediatric patients, it is in the recovery stage that DS complications arise29,30. Recovery from heart surgery is difficult even in adult patients and for pediatric cases complicated by DS, recovery troubles are compounded by various developmental deficits7. A retrospective study by Nasser and colleagues found that almost 12% of DS patients recovering from heart surgery needed prolonged mechanical ventilation and almost half of these patients required medication for resultant hypertension31. Hematological abnormalities can also be present, complicating wound healing32,33. Adding to this complex issue is the amount of sedative needed to prevent unnecessary suffering and anxiety during the healing process. In DS patients, there is clinical evidence that trisomy disorders increase the need for MDZ and similar drugs due to alterations in the GABAergic transmission system10,34. On the translational side, many fundamental studies showed altered GABAergic transmission in murine models that mimic the brain morphology of DS34 and indicated that GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission occurs in the hippocampus35.The propensity of DS patients to more frequently suffer from epilepsy (mediated in the hippocampus), along with dysregulated GABA excitatory-inhibitory balance is hypothesized to be one of the main reasons for the reduced effect of BDZ36. With this hypothesis in mind, we sought to establish a more solid link between DS and BDZ-class anesthesia midazolam requirements by a retrospective, single-center analysis. Although we did not do genetic screens, we did have validated sedation and risk scales (SBS and PELOD-2) to base our measurements on. We compensated for fluctuations in recovery inherent to cardiovascular surgery by using Bayesian inference for GLMM. We found that, in general, DS patients required more BDZ over longer periods than normal patients and that daily cumulative doses of dexmedetomidine were increased to compensate for the lessened effect of MDZ. Although we did not observe any prevalence of sedation-related syndromes such as withdrawal and delirium over our study period, a longer duration, multi-centered study saw a prevalence of withdrawal syndrome of more than 60% after mechanical ventilation and sedative administration of more than 5 days37. As DS patients have more complex recoveries than normal, it is entirely possible that any recovery lengthened by DS complications will require more sedatives that, in turn, will increase withdrawal symptoms after prolonged usage. Furthermore, a recent study showed that MDZ usage is a risk factor for developing pediatric delirium38. Taken together, these results pair well with our results and indicate that a new approach to sedation in DS patients is required. Unpredictable, variable and serious complications in respiration, clotting, drug metabolism, and slower healing after surgery require longer recoveries and more sedation to compensate for this. Additionally, as DS patients may suffer from withdrawal symptoms after extended use of sedatives such as BDZ, this could introduce additional suffering to patients already weakened from invasive surgery.",
