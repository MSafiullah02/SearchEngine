In a heterogeneous electric field, a dielectric particle becomes electrically polarized due to charge separation that creates a dipole and bears a net dielectrophoretic force. The magnitude of this force, which can be exerted on neutral particles, depends on the medium and particle properties (shape, size, and electrical features) and on the frequency of the electric field. If a suspended particle has a polarizability higher than the medium, the dielectrophoretic force attracts the particle toward regions of higher electric field (positive dielectrophoretic force) and conversely (negative dielectrophoretic force).\n",

Exposure to PM2.5 increases significantly concentrations of stress hormones and markers of insulin resistance, along with blood pressure, and provokes redox stress and inflammation [261]. Exposure to PM2.5 can thus activate the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal and sympathetic\u2013adrenal axes, contributing to adverse metabolic and cardiovascular effects. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone, which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland, which secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the blood, reaching the adrenal cortex, where it stimulates the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol and cortisone. The synthesis and secretion of catecholamines in the adrenal medulla is regulated by preganglionic sympathetic neurons. Glucocorticoids can also modulate catecholamine synthesis via phenylethanolamine methyltransferase. Conversely, adrenaline can stimulate ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland. Glucocorticoids provoke vasoconstriction. In addition, they increase metabolic rate and energy expenditure, glycemia, as well as lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and proteolysis, and they favor insulin resistance. Catecholamines augment glycolysis and lipolysis, cause vasoconstriction, and raise cardiac output and formation of proinflammatory cytokines. Exposure to PM2.5 may also stimulate the secretion in the pineal gland via \u03b2-adrenoceptors of melatonin, a circadian cycle regulator, which has an anti-inflammatory effect and is a ROS scavenger. In addition, greater levels of lysolipids (e.g., lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine) accompany higher PM exposure. Indoor air purification for 48 h not only reduces personal exposure to fine PM but also yields cardiopulmonary benefits following consecutive exposures [261].",

Transcription of the miR143\u2013miR145 cluster is primed by SRF and its coactivators, myocardin and myocardin-related transcription factors. They are atheroprotective and prevent intimal hyperplasia induced by vascular injury, which launches vSMC dedifferentiation and cytoskeletal remodeling. MiR143 and miR145 are also transferred from ECs to vSMCs by extracellular vesicles; KLF2 increases their amount in ECs and triggers their release via microvesicles [331]. They play a crucial role in cooperation with other miRNAs, such as miR1 and miR24, in the differentiation and proliferation of vSMCs. MiR1, the formation of which is triggered by myocardin in vSMCs, precludes cell proliferation but inhibits myocardin-induced vSMC contractility. The Jag1\u2013notch axis can also induce transcription of the miR143\u2013miR145 cluster. MiR143 and miR145 repress Kr\u00fcppel-like factors KLF4 and KLF5 that inhibit myocardin, thereby supporting vSMC differentiation and repressing their proliferation. TGF\u03b2 and BMP4 are potent inducers of contractile vSMC phenotype; they prevent vSMC proliferation and migration. KLF4 hampers activation of the CArG box by SRF and its coactivators. TGF\u03b2 and BMP4 downregulate KLF4 synthesis via miR143 and miR145 [341]. In addition, miR143 also reduces the production of ETS-like factor ELk1, hence promoting synthetic phenotype. Furthermore, miR145 downregulates ACE. Angiotensin-2 is a vasoconstrictor that also exerts a proinflammatory effect via IL6 and CCL2 and elicits vSMC proliferation and hypertrophy, mostly via AT1, the MAPK module, NF\u03baB, and CREB [339]. Conversely, miR143 and miR145 are repressed by ACE, KLF4, and KLF5, which then favor neointima formation [298]. In addition, miR145 targets slit-robo GTPase-activating protein SRGAP1 (RhoGAP13) and SRGAP2 (RhoGAP34), adducin-3, slingshot-2 phosphatase, and calmodulin kinase CamK2\u03b4, which are involved in the regulation of SRF activity and actin dynamics [331].

Conversely, miR599 represses vSMC proliferation and migration in addition to the synthesis of PCNA, an auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase-\u03b4 involved in the control of DNA replication, and of cellular proliferation marker protein MKi67, an antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki67, which is encoded by the MKI67 gene and linked to the perichromosomal layer during mitosis, acting as a surfactant [358]. In addition, miR599 suppresses production of collagen-1 and -5 and proteoglycan. In vSMCs, the TGFB2 transcript is a substrate of miR599 [357]. TGF\u03b22 can reverse miR599-primed prevention of vSMC proliferation along with collagen and proteoglycan synthesis. MiR590-3p increases vSMC contractility and represents a risk factor for hypertension in the presence of genetic defects [286].",

In CFBmir33\u2212\u2215\u2212 (i.e., only in cardiofibroblasts), cardiac fibrosis is attenuated in response to hypertension. Depletion of miR33a impedes PKB activation but favors ABCa1 expression. MiR33 can control cardiofibroblast proliferation, as it can target CDK6, CcnD1, and P53 in some cell types [364], but CDK4 is predominant over CDK6 in fibroblasts [378]. In fact, miR33a preserves the cholesterol content of membrane rafts, which enable PKB activation and cardiofibroblast proliferation.78 On the other hand, upregulated synthesis of ABCa1, which permits efflux of intracellular free cholesterol to extracellular cholesterol acceptor ApoA1, depletes the cholesterol content of membrane rafts and alters the proliferative capacity of cardiofibroblasts.",

Cellular stress activates the BRG1\u2013HDAC\u2013PARP chromatin repressor complex and prevents Mhrt transcription, enabling cardiomyopathy development. In a given cell, the BRG1 complex inhibits both MYH6 and Mhrt and reactivates MYH7 expression. On the other hand, the Mhrt spliced isoforms tether to and antagonize the chromatin remodeler and helicase BRG1, which can connect to mhrt and chromatinized (but not naked) DNA, preventing cardiac adverse hypertrophic gene reprogramming. Mhrt directly interacts with BRG1 helicase domain [424], as a decoy to regulate its chromatin remodeling activity, similar to braveheart, which operates as a decoy for the PRC2 complex [383].",

Extracellular GaL3 mediates cellular adhesion and cytokine production. Homocysteine, which is produced by methionine processing, stimulates activity of the GaL3 inducer, NF\u03baB. Galectin-3 contributes to macrophage activation, especially in atherosclerotic plaques [473]. Hyperhomocysteinemia is observed in patients with unstable CoAD.
