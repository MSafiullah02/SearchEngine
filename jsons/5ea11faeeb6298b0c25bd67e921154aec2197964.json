Objective To investigate anti-bacterial and anti-allergen antibody responses during convalescence from asthma exacerbation and differences found in exacerbations associated with and without viral infection. Results IgE antibodies to the P6 bacterial antigen increased in 60% of sera during convalescence and for many children achieved titres as high as IgE titres to allergens. In contrast IgE anti-HDM titres declined during convalescence. The anti-bacterial IgE titres were the same in subjects with and without virus infection while the anti-HDM IgE declined more rapidly in virus-infected subjects. IgG titres to the major HDM allergens showed no consistent increase and the overall IgG anti-HDM titres even declined in subjects without a virus infection. Anti-bacterial IgG antibodies in contrast to IgE did not change. Patients with frequent episodic or persistent asthma had similar IgE anti-bacterial titres to patients with infrequent asthma during the acute phase, although they had reduced IgG titres to both the bacteria and the HDM. Conclusions During the period following an acute exacerbation of asthma there was a marked and specific increase in anti-bacterial IgE compared with a reduced IgE response to HDM.

When the difference between the acute and convalescent IgE anti-HDM titres in the virus positive and virus negative groups were analysed separately, the patients without a virus infection showed a twofold reduction in titre while the average titre for the virus positive group were reduced sixfold and this was statistically significant. A possible reason for this is that the RV infection had caused a transient increase before presentation so there was a greater decline in convalescence. The reductions should, however, be viewed in the context that the IgE titres detected during the exacerbations were no higher than those detected for children with stable asthma [2] and that the decreases were usually only to levels still within the range commonly found during the exacerbations. Because the children were administered increased medication after the exacerbation, particularly corticosteroids, the treatment, as reported by some investigators [16] [17] [18] , could be a possible cause of the decline. However, regardless of the mechanism responsible for the decreased IgE, the reduction would be beneficial for the patient. As well as reducing responses to HDM allergen the decrease in total IgE would reduce the allergen-independent FceR1 binding that activate mast cells and stabilize receptor expression [19] . It was previously found that the children recruited from the emergency department with an asthma exacerbation had markedly less IgG antibody to mite allergens than children with stable asthma [2] with a prevalence of 33 compared with 92%. While some individual changes of IgG were found in convalescence they were both up and down, with most titres remaining negative. An IgG response was thus not restored over the period of convalescence but this remains an important feature to study for the susceptibility to acute attacks of asthma. When the summated IgG1 titres for all the HDM allergens were analysed they in fact declined during the convalescence period but only for the group without associated RV infection. The potential significance of the low IgG antibody was further underscored by the finding here that the summated IgG1 titres to the HDM allergens were the lowest in the patients with frequent episodic and persistent asthma. Animal studies have demonstrated that there are several mechanisms by which IgG antibodies can ameliorate allergic responses in vivo [3] so the sustained low titres in children with exacerbations and the association of low titres with persistent disease suggests they may be protective for human asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 900, "end": 903, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1186, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1191, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1551, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1749, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2632, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A previous study measured antibodies to the P6 outer membrane protein of H. influenzae as a potential mucosal bystander antigen to the responses to allergen [4] .

This is therefore evidence for the possibility that Th2 cytokines produced during the exacerbation to direct an antibacterial response to a Th2-regulated antibody isotype. The presence of IgE antibodies to bacteria, including H. influenzae, has been known for some time [22, 23] but the quantitative assays used here reveal not only a very high frequency, but also the antibody levels can be of considerable magnitude. A number of the children developed titres of 5-15 ng of IgE/mL, which raises the possibility that the IgE interacting with the bacterial antigen may even have an effect on prolonging the inflammation. For comparison, the median anti-Fel d 1 IgE titre for people with rhinoconjunctivitis to cats is 6 ng/mL [24, 25] . The anti-P6 titres even reach the level of the responses to the major HDM allergens of about 50% of the HDMsensitized children in this study and 40% of those measured by Trombone et al. [26] . The bacteria are usually present in concentrations of over 10 3 /mL of aspirate [27] so there is reasonable scope for antigen-antibody interactions. Similar responses to other colonizing bacteria must also be considered.

Steroids for example inhibit early Bcell responses and increase later immunoglobulin switching. The results here are reminiscent of those reported by Diaz-Sanchez et al.
