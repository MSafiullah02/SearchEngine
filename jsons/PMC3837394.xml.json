            "text": "The genome contains genetic and epigenetic information. While the genome provides the blueprint for the manufacture of all the proteins required to create a living thing, the epigenetic information provides instruction on how, where, and when the genetic information should be used (Robertson, 2001). The major form of epigenetic information within the DNA molecule itself in mammalian cells is DNA methylation, that is, the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of cytosine, mostly within the CpG dinucleotides in somatic cells (Robertson, 2001). DNA methylation is involved in the control of gene expression, regulation of parental imprinting, and stabilization of X chromosome inactivation as well as maintenance of the genome integrity. It is also implicated in the development of the immune system, cellular reprogramming, and brain function and behavior (Jurkowska et al., 2011). DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs). In mammals, three DNMTs have been identified so far in the human genome, including the two de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and the maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1), which is generally the most abundant and active of the three (Robertson, 2001, Yokochi and Robertson, 2002, Goll and Bestor, 2005). DNMT1 is responsible for duplicating patterns of DNA methylation during replication and is essential for mammalian development and cancer cell growth (Chen et al., 2007). These enzymes are key regulators of gene transcription, and their roles in carcinogenesis have been the subject of considerable interest over the past decade (Robertson, 2001, Jones and Baylin, 2007). Therefore, specific inhibition of DNA methylation is an attractive and novel approach for cancer therapy (Robertson, 2001, Lyko and Brown, 2005, Kelly et al., 2010, Portela and Esteller, 2010). DNA methylation inhibitors have also emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of immunodeficiency and brain disorders (Zawia et al., 2009, Miller et al., 2010).",

The mechanism of DNA cytosine-C5 methylation is schematically depicted in Fig. 1\n(Vilkaitis et al., 2001, Schermelleh et al., 2005, Sippl and Jung, 2009). DNMT forms a complex with DNA and the cytosine which will be methylated flips out from the DNA. The thiol of the catalytic cysteine acts as a nucleophile that attacks the 6-position of the target cytosine to generate a covalent intermediate. The 5-position of the cytosine is activated and conducts a nucleophilic attack on the cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet/SAM) to form the 5-methyl covalent adduct and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy/SAH). The attack on the 6-position is assisted by a transient protonation of the cytosine ring at the endocyclic nitrogen atom N3, which is stabilized by a glutamate residue. An arginine residue may participate in the stabilization of the intermediate making a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of cytosine. The covalent complex between the methylated base and the DNA is resolved by deprotonation at the 5-position to generate the methylated cytosine and the free enzyme.",

The N-terminal domain guides the nuclear localization of the enzymes and mediates their interactions with other proteins, DNA, and chromatin. The smaller C-terminal domain harbors the active center of the enzyme and contains 10 amino acid motifs diagnostic for all carbon-5 DNMTs (Jurkowska et al., 2011). The catalytic domain has a core structure shared by all DNMTs. This core structure is termed the \u201cAdoMet-dependent MTase fold\u201d and consists of a six-stranded parallel \u03b2 sheet with a seventh strand inserted in a parallel fashion between the fifth and sixth strands. Six helices are folded around the central \u03b2 sheet. Motifs I and X of this domain are involved in the cofactor binding. Motifs IV, VI, and VIII are involved in catalysis. The target recognition domain (TRD) is a nonconserved region between motifs VIII and IX that is involved in DNA recognition and specificity (Fig. 2) (Jeltsch, 2002, Jurkowska et al., 2011).",

To date, only 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (decitabine) have been developed clinically. These two drugs are nucleoside analogues, which, after incorporation into DNA, cause covalent trapping and subsequent depletion of DNMTs (Schermelleh et al., 2005, Stresemann and Lyko, 2008). Aza nucleosides are approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, where they demonstrate significant, although usually transient, improvement in patient survival and are currently being tested in many solid cancers (Issa et al., 2005, Schrump et al., 2006). However, aza nucleosides have relatively low specificity and are characterized by substantial cellular and clinical toxicity (Stresemann and Lyko, 2008). Their exact mechanism of antitumor action also remains unclear (Issa, 2005, Palii et al., 2008, Fandy et al., 2009). Consequently, there is clear need to identify novel and more specific DNMT inhibitors that do not function via incorporation into DNA.",

Prior docking, the conformation of the catalytic site was modeled into an active conformation using MD. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular modeling study conducted with the catalytic binding site of the crystal structure of human DNMT1. Based on the docking results, we developed a structure-based pharmacophore model of DNMT1 inhibitors. In an effort to identify novel nonnucleoside DNMT1 inhibitors, we also report the experimental activity of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) that showed submicromolar inhibition against DNMT1. Molecular modeling studies of ATA with the catalytic site of the crystal structure of DNMT1 are also discussed.",

In this structure, the catalytic loop has an open conformation such that the catalytic cysteine is far away from the binding site. Therefore, the geometry of the catalytic site of the crystal structure does not represent the active conformation of the enzyme that corresponds to the catalytic mechanism of DNA methylation. In contrast, in the X-ray structure of bacterial M.HhaI (Klimasauskas et al., 1994, Kumar et al., 1997) and in our previously developed homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b), the DNA is embedded in the catalytic core and the catalytic loops are also close to the inserted target cytosine in the active site (Fig. 3\n). We therefore used MD to model the crystal structure of the human DNMT1\u2013DNA into an active state. To this end, the crystal structure of the DNMT1\u2013DNA complex with bound AdoHcy was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 3PTA). The unmethylated DNA and other domains, except the methyltransferase domain, were removed. The DNA double helix reconstructed from the structure of M.HhaI (PDB: 1MHT) (Klimasauskas et al., 1994), in the catalytic core, and target cytosine inserted into the active site. The missing residues (1480\u20131483) were modeled using Prime (version 2.2, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010). The refined model was treated according to the Protein Preparation Wizard implemented in Maestro, which optimizes H-bond networks and flip orientations/tautomeric states of Gln, Asn, and His residues, and performed a geometry optimization to a maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.3 \u00c5 with OPLS2005 force field. We have recently employed a similar procedure to prepare the structure of other proteins (Hern\u00e1ndez-Campos et al., 2010). The stability of the refined model was probed by an MD simulation using MacroModel (version 9.8, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010). A stochastic dynamics (SD) method was used with the OPLS force field and implicit water solvation under the following conditions: (a) equilibration time 1.0 ps at 300 K, (b) 100 ps of simulation time at 300 K, (c) time steps = 1.5 fs, and (d) 100 conformations stored. To make a direct comparison of the energy of the conformers obtained by SD, the collection of SD conformations was submitted to a multiminimization step with the Polak-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (PRCG). Convergence in the SD simulation was judged complete by the RMSD of the 100 stored structures and the interaction between key amino acid residues and target cytosine.",

Although the RMSD of the C\u03b1 atoms of the initial and modified X-ray structure is 1.92 \u00c5, the catalytic loop of the modified structure adopts a different conformation with respect to the X-ray structure. In the X-ray structure, the distance of superimposed target cytosine C6 to the sulfur atom of Cys1226 in the catalytic loop is 9.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the catalytic loop of the modified structure is located above the cytosine as an \u201cactive site lid.\u201d The target cytosine lies between the nucleophile Cys1226 and sulfur atom of AdoHcy. The distance of cytosine C6 to the sulfur atom of Cys1226 is 3.4 \u00c5, and cytosine C5 atom is 3.5 \u00c5 away from the sulfur atom of AdoHcy. In addition, the N3 protonated form of cytosine can make hydrogen bond with the acidic side chain of Glu1266, Pro1224, Arg1310, and Arg1312 (Fig. 4E). The \u03b1-phosphate backbone of deoxycytidine makes a hydrogen bond network with Arg1312, Ser1230, Gly1231, and Lys1535. In addition, the 3\u2032-OH of the sugar moiety forms hydrogen bonds with Thr1528 and Gly1577. Interestingly, the key interactions with Glu1266 in the ENV motif, Arg1312 in the RXR motif, Ser1230 and Gly1231 in the catalytic loop are observed in the homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b). The catalytic cores of the modified crystal structure and homology model of DNMT1 (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) have similar conformation of the catalytic loop. These insights suggest that the modified structure and homology model are reliable to explore the binding mode of inhibitors of human DNMT1.",

For reference (as negative control), we also docked 19 compounds that previously have shown very weak or no enzymatic inhibitory activity or that were used as decoys (NSC4092, NSC21970, NSC57278, NSC19555, NSC27292, and NSC303530; Siedlecki et al., 2006, Kuck et al., 2010b). The chemical structures of both groups of compounds are shown in Fig. 5\n. It is worth noting that all 35 compounds in Fig. 5 have not been screened under the same experimental conditions; therefore, a quantitative comparison between the docking scores and enzymatic inhibition is not feasible. However, it is possible to assess whether molecular docking is able to separate actives from inactives/decoys. Also, and more importantly in this case, we seek to explore the putative binding site of established inhibitors into the catalytic binding site using the crystallographic structure of DNMT1.",

Ligands were prepared with conformational search in MacroModel and LigPrep (version 2.4, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010) to generate all the possible configurations (LigPrep, 2010). The conformational analysis was carried out with Monte Carlo Multiple Minimum and Low-Mode conformational search method, employing the OPLS force field using GB/SA water solvation model. The lowest energy conformation of each ligand was docked with the X-ray structure modified to an active conformation (see above) using the program Glide (version 5.6, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010). Our group has successfully used Glide to develop binding models of inhibitors of DNMTs (Kuck et al., 2010a, Kuck et al., 2010b, Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011, Medina-Franco et al., 2011, Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b, Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011c). Three flexible docking methods, including high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP), implemented in Glide were used for comparison. For each method, a receptor grid box of 23 \u00c5 on each side, with a default inner box (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00c53), was centered on the target cytosine. Input partial charges were used and no constrains were applied during docking. In the case of the HTVS and SP docking methods, one pose per ligand was intended for large database screening applications, and 10 poses per ligand for XP docking method was set to optimize more precise poses of the top-scoring ligands by HTVS and SP docking. The postdocking minimization was applied to investigate their effect on the accuracy in the three docking protocols: five docking poses per ligand were minimized for HTVS and SP, and 10 poses per ligand for XP. The best docking poses of XP docking were selected to generate the pharmacophore features (see below).",

The docking results were able to predict energetically favorable binding modes with accurate scoring of docking conformations. Docking results with Glide HTVS and SP with the modified crystal structure and homology model showed significant impact on ranking score with remarkable consistency as shown in graph of Table I. In the docking results of HTVS and SP, the ranking of active and that of inactive have similar variations. Almost all active compounds have more stable energy values than inactives. Of note, all known inhibitors except procaine and procainamide ranked higher than decoys. Nucleoside inhibitors including 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (decitabine) showed the best Glide XP docking scores using the modified crystallographic and homology models.

The binding modes of nucleoside inhibitors closely match with the target cytidine. The \u03b1-phosphate of 5-azacytidine and zebularine makes a hydrogen bond network with Ser1230 and Gly1231 in the catalytic loop, with Lys1535 in the TRD, and Arg1312. The ribose groups form additional hydrogen bonds with Thr1528, Gly1577, and Asn1578. The target base of most nucleoside inhibitors makes key interactions with the conserved glutamate residue in the ENV motif (motif IV: E/Glu1266, N/Asn1267, V/Val1268) and arginine residues in the RXR motif (motif VIII: R/Arg1310, X/1311, R/Arg1312), and Pro1224. Although zebularine does not form hydrogen bonds with Glu1266 and Pro1224 (due to the fact that zebularine lacks the amino group at the C4 position), the distance of 3.7 \u00c5 between Cys1226 and C6 is sufficient to start the catalytic mechanism. In addition, the N3 of zebularine and O\u03b51 of Glu1266 are in an available hydrogen bonding distance for N3 protonation (Fig. 6). These observations are in agreement with the docking poses in the catalytic site of homology model of hDNMT1 (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b). In the homology model, nucleoside inhibitors make hydrogen bond networks with common key amino acid residues, Pro1223, Glu1265 Arg1311, Ser1229, and Gly1230. The RMSD values of the top-scored poses of nucleoside inhibitors between modified crystal structure and homology are less than 1.0 \u00c5. These comparisons show that similar binding modes were obtained in the crystal structure modeled to an active state and the previously generated homology model of hDNMT1. Therefore, these results suggest that both models of DNMT1 are useful for scoring and pose selection for virtual screening. In the next few paragraphs, we describe in more detail the binding mode of representative inhibitors of DNMT1 into the catalytic site of the crystal structure of human DNMT1 modeled into an active conformation.",

Figure 6C shows the comparison of the binding modes of hydralazine with target cytidine. The amino group of hydralazine and cytidine matched well, forming a hydrogen bond with Glu1266 and Pro1224. The nitrogen of the phthalazine ring overlapped with the carbonyl oxygen and formed hydrogen bonds with Arg1310 and Arg1312 in the RXR motif. Similar binding mode of hydralazine with low RMSD (0.52 \u00c5) was obtained using a homology model of DNMT1 with same docking protocol (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b). According to the binding pose, the small structure of hydralazine could not occupy the site of the sugar ring and phosphate backbone of nucleoside analogues.

We employed the structure-based pharmacophore approach that we previously used to model DNMT inhibitors using a homology model of the catalytic site (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b). This approach is based on mapping the energetic terms from the Glide XP scoring function onto atom centers and has the advantage of combining pharmacophore perception with protein\u2013ligand energetic terms to rank the importance of the pharmacophore features (Salam et al., 2009). The docking models of the inhibitors were refined using Glide XP, the Glide XP scoring terms were computed, and the energies were mapped into atoms. Then, the pharmacophoric sites were automatically generated with Phase (version 3.2, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010) using the default set of six chemical features, namely, hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrophobic (H), negative ionizable (N), positive ionizable (P), and aromatic ring (R) site. The Glide XP energies from the atoms that comprise each pharmacophoric site were summed. The pharmacophoric sites were then ranked based on the summed energies, and the most favorable sites were selected for the pharmacophore hypothesis (Salam et al., 2009). These features were used to develop a common pharmacophore model that was evaluated on its ability to reproduce known inhibitors using Phase. The distance matching tolerance was set to 2.0 \u00c5. To account for protein flexibility and lessen the effects of minor steric clashes, excluded volume spheres were created for all receptor atoms within 5 \u00c5 around each ligand. Each sphere has a radius corresponding to 50% of the van der Waals radius of the receptor atom. Receptor atoms less than 1.5 \u00c5 from the ligand were ignored. The combination of best-scoring features that matched a minimum of two sites in each known inhibitor was chosen and regenerated (Salam et al., 2009).",

The energetic value and amino acid residues participating in the interaction are shown in the figure. The best-scoring feature is a negative charge (N) which is close to the side chains of Ser1230, Gly1231, Lys1535, and Arg1312. The second and third favorable features are a donor site (D) that is near the side chain of Gly1577 and an acceptor site (A) that is in close proximity to the side chain of Arg1310 and Arg1312 in the RXR motif. The fourth ranked feature is an aromatic ring (R) that stabilizes the binding conformations of ligands between AdoHcy and Cys1226. The fifth ranked feature is a donor site (D) that is near the side chain of Glu1266, which is a residue implicated in the mechanism of methylation (Fig. 7A). These pharmacophore features represent the most important interactions of the 16 DNMT1 inhibitors with the catalytic site. Notably, glutamate in the ENV motif and the arginines in the RXR motif are highly conserved residues in catalytic domains of DNMTs (Jurkowska et al., 2011). Interestingly, the five-feature pharmacophore model derived with the modified crystal structure of DNMT1 (Fig. 7A) is consistent with the pharmacophore hypothesis previously reported with the homology model of DNMT1, although the ranking of the features and nearby amino acids are slightly different. Most of the inhibitors matched several pharmacophore features considering a distance tolerance of 2 \u00c5. Representative examples are shown in Fig. 7B\u2013E. All nucleoside analogues except zebularine matched with all five pharmacophore features (Fig. 7B and C). Zebularine matches four features, but it does not satisfy the hydrogen bonding donor feature interacting with Glu1266 because zebularine does not have the amino group on the base ring. However, the donor feature (D) can match the N3 protonated form of zebularine.",

For this assay, full-length human DNMT1 was expressed by baculovirus infection of Sf9 insect cells for 48 h. DNMT1 in this system (FastBac-HT system, Invitrogen) is hexahistidine tagged and purified on nickel NTA resin as we have described previously (Yokochi and Robertson, 2002) and dialyzed to remove imidazole. DNMT1 was used with the colorimetric 96-well-plate-based DNMT activity kit from Epigentek (an ELISA-like assay using anti-5-methylcytosine antibody to detect methylation). After a 1-h incubation of DNMT1 with substrate plus or minus inhibitor, samples were read in a plate reader at 450 nm to determine activity. Figure 8A illustrates the dose\u2013response plot over a range of DNMT1 concentrations for this assay. This figure (Fig. 8B\u2013D) also shows inhibition plots for selected inhibitors that were used as positive controls, namely, SAH, the natural product EGCG, and the l-tryptophan derivative RG108. SAH and EGCG showed IC50 values of 8.6 and 0.7 \u03bcM, respectively. Under these assay conditions, RG108 showed only 11% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM. Figure 9A shows the inhibition plot for ATA, revealing an IC50\n = 0.68 \u03bcM against DNMT1. Of note, the enzymatic inhibitory activity of ATA against DNMT1 was greater than the activity of SAH and RG108 and it was comparable with the activity of EGCG under the current assay conditions. We also measured the Dnmt3a inhibition by ATA that showed an IC50\n = 1.4 \u03bcM (Fig. 9B), indicating that ATA is somewhat selective toward DNMT1 (approximately two-fold).",

Docking of ATA with the crystal structure of DNTM1 modified into an active conformation suggested two binding poses. The first docking pose of ATA is shown in Fig. 6D as a deprotonated form (expected in aqueous solution). According to this binding model, ATA forms a strong hydrogen bond network with the same amino acid residues that interact with the nucleoside inhibitors. The hydroxybenzoic acid moieties of ATA form hydrogen bonds with Glu1266, Arg1310, Arg1312, Ser1230, Gly1231, and Lys1535. The other carboxylate group makes interactions with Asn1578. The structurally related 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid (NSC14778) showed weak inhibitory activity against DNMT1 in a biochemical assay (Kuck et al., 2010b). Although the binding pose of NSC14778 partially overlaps ATA showing same interactions with Ser1230, Gly1231, and Lys1535, NSC14778 does not make key interactions with Glu1266 and Arg1312 (not shown). A similar binding model of NSC14778 was also determined in our previous study using the homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b). The second pose of ATA was consistent with the recently reported binding mode in the catalytic site of homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011c).

Computational approaches are increasingly being used to identify promising compounds as potential therapeutic agents or as research tools to study epigenetic mechanisms involving DNMTs. Also, computational methods are employed to better understand the mechanism of established inhibitors of DNA methylation. Herein, we describe molecular modeling studies with a recently published crystallographic structure of human DNMT1 that contains unmethylated DNA and the enzyme in an \u201cinactive\u201d conformation. The conformation of the crystallographic structure was modeled in an active state using molecular dynamics. Experimentally known DNMT1 inhibitors were docked in parallel into the modified crystal structure with Glide HTVS, SP, and XP. The binding modes were characterized by common interactions with amino acid residues that participate in the proposed mechanism of DNA C5-methylation and other key amino acid residues including Ser1230, Gly1231, Glu1266, Arg1310, Arg1312, and Lys1535. The docking scores were also able to distinguish active inhibitors from known inactive and previously used decoy compounds. Indeed, most of the established inhibitors of DNMT1 had high ranking scores. Based on the docking results, a structure-based pharmacophore model was developed that was characterized by five features, including a negative charge, an aromatic ring, a hydrogen bond acceptor, and two donor sites. The pharmacophore model represents the key protein\u2013ligand interactions of the DNMT1 inhibitors obtained in docking. Results of the docking and pharmacophore modeling had a good agreement with the insights of the modeling studies published previously using a homology model of the catalytic domain of DNMT1. As part of an ongoing interest of identifying novel inhibitors, we experimentally tested ATA in an enzymatic inhibition assay. Preliminary docking studies of ATA with DNMT1 had strongly suggested that this structural analogue of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid would show enzymatic inhibitory activity. Indeed, ATA showed an IC50\n = 0.68 \u03bcM against human DNMT1. We also measured the DNMT3A inhibition by ATA, which showed an IC50\n = 1.4 \u03bcM, indicating that ATA is somewhat selective toward DNMT1 (approximately twofold).",

In order to further explore and perhaps someday enhance the enzymatic selectivity toward DNMT1 over murine Dnmt3a, we are currently employing molecular docking and other modeling approaches of ATA with the published crystal structure of DNMT3A (Jia et al., 2007). Results of these insights from the molecular modeling will be published in a separate communication in due course.",
