In reported cases of feline herpes dermatitis the lesional skin is histologically characterized by a severe eosinophil-rich necrosis and epidermal ulceration with extension of necrosis into hair follicles and underlying dermis. Intranuclear inclusion bodies in the surface epithelia and adnexal epithelia can be found within the lesions. 7, 9 Misdiagnosis as eosinophilic granuloma may occur, if inclusion bodies are missed. 6, 7 Currently, limited information exists on therapy, clinical course, and outcome of feline herpes dermatitis.

            "text": "Case history and treatment A 14-year-old neutered Abyssinian-mix female in-and outdoor cat was presented for dermatological examination of a progressive lesion on the left lateral muzzle. The cat had no health problems except for a 3 years' duration of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated since with 6 mg Atenolon (Tenormin Submite\u00ae, AstraZeneca, Zug, Switzerland) daily. A single episode of vomiting unrelated to the treatment was observed. Three months before referral the cat was presented to the referring veterinarian with an exudative lesion on the left latero-rostral muzzle. There was no previous history of rhinotracheitis and/or conjunctivitis. As the lesion did not respond to either antibiotics or prednisolone, the referring veterinarian took a skin biopsy and submitted it to the dermatopathology service of the Institute of Animal Pathology (Vetsuisse Faculty University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland). Histologically, a diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma was made. Upon diagnosis, the cat, weighing 3.5 kg, was further treated with oral prednisolone, 5 mg day \u2212 1 for 6 weeks and with oral clindamycin (Antirobe\u00ae, Pfizer Animal Health, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), 25 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. The lesions did not show any response to therapy. Dermatophyte culture was negative. Two months after the biopsy, the cat developed a new lesion on the right nasal ala. The cat was then referred to the dermatology service. At presentation, the cat had two lesions. The lesion on the left side of the muzzle bordering on the nasal planum and lip margin was 1.5 \u00d7 3 cm, firm on palpation with thickening of the lip. The lesion was erythematous, alopecic, had a shiny appearance and had several erosions and small crusts. Some whiskers remained. A second small, ulcerated lesion with a thin crust was present on the right ala of the nose (Fig. 1) . The lip margin itself and the oral cavity were not affected. Physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. Treatment with oral cephalexin 20 mg kg \u2212 1 twice daily for 3 weeks was started in order to reduce possible secondary bacterial infection to obtain a good quality biopsy. To limit a possible corticosteroid influence on histology, a recheck was scheduled after 3 weeks to biopsy the lesions. Clinical differential diagnoses consisted of feline herpes dermatitis, mosquito bite hypersensitivity, mast cell tumour, and dermatophytosis. At re-evaluation of the histological sections of the skin biopsies taken by the referring veterinarian, intranuclear inclusion bodies were detected and a presumptive diagnosis of infection What is known about the topic of your paper \u2022 A good pathology service is important.",

Detection limits of PCR techniques vary widely and they do not discriminate between viable cultivable virions and immature, immunologically inactivated DNA. 10 For ethical reasons, the planned skin biopsies were not taken. PCR for detection of FHV-1 was performed at the Institute of Virology (Vetsuisse Faculty Z\u00fcrich, University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), following an established protocol for real time TaqMan PCR, 11 which confirmed the diagnosis of a FHV-1 infection. After obtaining the owner's consent and discussion with a representative of Virbac Switzerland, the following treatment schedule with recombinant interferon omega (rFeIFN-\u03c9 ) (Virbagen omega\u00ae, Virbac SA, Carros, France) was started. Day 0: injection of 1.5 million units (MU) kg \u2212 1 of rFeIFN-\u03c9 , half of which was injected perilesionally and intradermally and the other half subcutaneously on the lateral thorax while the cat was sedated with propofol (Propofol\u00ae1% Fresenius, Fresenius AG, Bad Homburg, Germany), as needed (2-5 mg kg \u2212 1 ). The lesion on the nose regressed very rapidly, showing a clear improvement at day 2 already. Day 2 and day 9: 1.5 MU kg \u2212 1 of rFeIFN-\u03c9 was injected subcutaneously on the lateral thorax and 10 days later, the cat was re-examined. The lesion on the right nasal ala had disappeared completely and the lesion on the muzzle was less swollen and ulcerations had healed.",

            "text": "In this case report, a cat diagnosed with herpes virusinduced facial dermatitis was successfully treated with IFN-\u03c9 . Reports on treatment and prognosis of feline herpes dermatitis are lacking. Cats with herpes dermatitis have been managed with antibiotics and oral human IFN\u03b1 , surgical excision and acyclovir. 1, 7, 8 Acyclovir, however, is known to have a relatively poor in vitro efficacy against FHV-1 12 and a poor bioavailability in cats. 13 Oral supplementation with L -lysine has been shown to be effective in vitro and in vivo in cats with latent infections with FHV-1. 14 The presumed mechanism is based on the known antagonism of the growth-promoting effects of arginine, which is an essential amino acid for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) of humans, which shows a comparable biological behaviour to FHV-1. 15, 16 Oral administration of human IFN-\u03b1 has been reported in several studies in cats with FeLV infection showing different efficacies. [17] [18] [19] Recombinant feline IFN-\u03c9 (rFeIFN) is a type I IFN and has a similar mode of action as IFN-\u03b1 . Type I IFNs bind to \u03b1 / \u03b2 receptors on host cells and have multiple antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities. 20 IFNs can inhibit cell growth and thereby prevent replication of some viruses. IFNs induce apoptosis in virus-infected cells and enhance expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and thereby promote CD8+ T-cell responses and stimulate cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. 20,21 IFN also induces a form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS 2 ) and MHC class I and II proteins, all of which play important roles in immune responses to infections. 21 rFeIFN-\u03c9 has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the replication of FHV-1 in vitro . 22 Other studies have shown an antiviral effect of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in the treatment of herpes keratitis, 23, 24 FeLV and FIV infection, 25 canine parvoviral enteritis [26] [27] [28] and gingivo-stomatitis. 29 rFeIFN-\u03c9 showed efficacy in vitro against canine parvovirus, feline panleuco-peniavirus, FHV-1, feline calicivirus and feline coronavirus. 30 The treatment schedule was chosen after discussion with the manufacturer and was based on experience with treatment of other diseases using rFeIFN-\u03c9 such as feline infectious peritonitis and feline calicivirus infection. Generally, rFeIFN-\u03c9 is injected subcutaneously on days 0, 2 and 4 and a second series is repeated after 1-2 weeks. Because the cat showed marked improvement after the perilesional injection, suggesting a strong local effect of the IFN, the perilesional application was chosen for the second treatment course.",

However, when the often rare viral inclusions are overlooked, the histological changes can be easily misdiagnosed as eosinophilic plaque, mosquito bite hypersensitivity and eosinophilic ulcer. 9 At present, limited information exists on the natural course of herpes dermatitis in cats and the influence of corticosteroids. This cat had received corticosteroids after developing the lesion, which may have delayed spontaneous healing. In theory, cessation of the corticosteroids may have influenced spontaneous regression of the lesion. However, the marked quick initial response to rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy, combined with the results of the histology, IHC and PCR analysis, strongly suggests a direct or at least additional treatment effect.",

Potentially, PCR is a more sensitive method to detect FHV compared to IHC, which was shown in humans with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1. 31 However, Weigler and coworkers showed that after replication at sites of initial inoculation, FHV retracts along the facial nerves and establishes latent infections in trigeminal ganglia, optic nerves, optic chiasma, the olfactory bulb and cornea, but is not expected to remain in the skin. 32 In cats with disease, detection of virus may indicate coincidence, consequential infection, or true causation with respect to the primary disease. Viral DNA detected by PCR assays in samples of healthy cats may represent avirulent virus or viral DNA fragments remaining after resolution of infection. 10 The finding of trans-epidermal collagen elimination was unexpected. Treatment of the trans-epidermal collagen elimination with halofuginone was discussed. Halofuginone is a collagen alpha 1 inhibitor 33 and was shown to be effective as a topical treatment of one cat diagnosed with reactive perforating collagenosis. 34 Unfortunately, halofuginone is not available in Switzerland, and as the cat did not develop new lesions, this type of treatment was not pursued.",
