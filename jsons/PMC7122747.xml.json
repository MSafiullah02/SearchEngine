It is estimated that pneumonia causes up to 2 million deaths per year in children under 5 years of age, and neonatal pneumonia or sepsis causes an additional 1 million deaths per year [1]; an important contributing factor to these deaths is malnutrition [2]. Acute respiratory infections include both acute upper-respiratory infections and acute lower-respiratory infections. Acute lower-respiratory infections consist primarily of pneumonia, but also include croup, tracheobronchitis, and bronchiolitis. The specific aims of this chapter are to present current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute lower-respiratory infections and the potential role of nutrition in treatment and prevention.",

The great influenza pandemic in 1918\u20131919 is considered to have accounted for the most deaths from an epidemic disease since the Black Death of the 14th century, killing an estimated 21 million people worldwide [7, 8]. The threat of the avian influenza virus H5N1 to mutate and be able to spread among humans has alerted the world of the current risk of a similar deadly pandemic [9, 10].",

By the turn of the century in the United States, it was estimated that mortality from pneumonia affected 1 of 500 individuals [12]. Antipneumoccocal sera were developed for the treatment of pneumonia; however, typing of the many pneumococcal strains was needed to ensure that the proper pneumococcal antisera were used. Sulfa antibiotics, which emerged in the late 1930s, were later shown to be more effective than serum therapy in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia [11]. Identification of many viral pathogens involved in acute respiratory infections, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and rhinoviruses, occurred in the 1950s [11].",

LBW infants appeared to have a 50% greater risk of pneumonia compared with infants with birth weight of 2,500 g or more [11]. These findings have been confirmed by longitudinal studies done in Pelotas, Brazil [18], and in China [19], where LBW children had higher hospital admissions for respiratory disease. LBW has also been associated with repeated episodes of wheezing disorders during the first year of life [20]. In a prospective study of premature infants with birth weight less than 1,500 g in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, respiratory morbidity was associated with previous mechanical ventilation, prolonged oxygen use (more than 28 days), and pneumonia in the neonatal period [21].",

Children in China who were not breast-fed were twice as likely to be hospitalized as breast-fed children [19]. Lack of breast-feeding was found to be a risk factor for acute lower-respiratory infection, including radiologically confirmed pneumonia, in case-control studies in Argentina [29] and Porto Alegre, Brazil [13]. Non-breast-fed children were 17 times more likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia than breast-fed children in Pelotas, Brazil; this risk increased to 61 times in infants under 3 months of age [30]. In a birth cohort study in poor rural areas of Malawi, early introduction of complementary feeding was associated with increased risk of respiratory infections, particularly among illiterate women [31]. Similar findings have been reported in cohort studies done in Iran [32] and Nigeria [33]. Studies in developed countries also indicated that exclusive breast-feeding during the first months of life protects against asthma at 6 years of age [34], an effect that may also exist in developing countries.",

In a large prospective birth cohort study in slum areas of Dhaka, Bangladesh, partial or no breast-feeding in the first months of life was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of death due to acute respiratory infections [36]. In a secondary analysis of a multicenter study done in Ghana, India, and Peru, non-breast-fed infants had a high risk (hazard ratio of 32.7) of death due to acute lower-respiratory infections [37] Breast-feeding may be protective against acute respiratory infections because of transfer of immunity by breast milk, the presence of antibacterial and antiviral substances in breast milk, and avoidance of pathogens from contaminated weaning foods [38\u201340]. Baby bottles are also known to be a risk factor for the development of acute otitis, diarrhea, and pneumonia [41].",

In addition, an association between undernutrition and an increased risk of developing pneumonia seems to exist, as indicated by hospital-based studies done in the Gambia [45], Brazil [18], and Chile [46], where undernutrition was identified as a risk factor for hospitalizations owing to pneumonia. In a case-control study done in the Gambia, the development of pneumococcal infections was associated with a history of poor weight gain prior to illness compared with community controls [47]. Malnutrition seems to increase the severity of acute lower-respiratory infection, increasing its probability of having bacteremia (in many cases with multiple microbial organisms), pleural effusion, and other complications [48]. In a review of ten cohort studies done in Africa and Southeast Asia, the relative risk of mortality due to pneumonia varied from 2.01 in children with \u20141 to \u20142 standard deviation (SD) weight-for-age to 8.09 in children with less than 3 SDs [2]. That review concluded that 52.3% of all pneumonia deaths in the world were attributable to undernutrition. In conclusion, poor nutritional status in children seems to be associated with a modest increased risk for developing any acute respiratory disease and a moderate risk for developing acute lower-respiratory infection or pneumonia, increasing its severity and therefore explaining an important proportion of deaths due to pneumonia worldwide.",

However, when respiratory diseases were assessed in carefully controlled prospective trials of vitamin A supplementation, no major reduction occurred in the mortality or morbidity associated with respiratory diseases, as indicated in an initial meta-analysis of available studies [52]. These findings were ratified by two meta-analyses [53, 54].

Premature infants may be particularly at risk. It is known that selenium serum concentration drops in premature infants after birth, especially in those who develop respiratory distress syndrome [64]. In a prospective study in LBW infants, low plasma selenium levels were associated with chronic lung disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as with the total days of oxygen requirement. For each drop of 0.1 \u03bcmol/L of selenium in plasma, there was a 58% increase in days of oxygen dependency, controlling for gestational age and age when infants were fully fed orally [65]. Premature infants, especially those treated with oxygen, may warrant selenium supplementation. Supplementation with one dose of 1 mg sodium selenite to routine treatment of children hospitalized with pneumonia or wheezing disorders associated with RSV [66] or Mycoplasma pneumonia [67] has been found to have a beneficial clinical effect in China. Food additives containing selenium have also been reported to have a beneficial effect in children with pneumonia in Russia [68, 69]. Further clinical trials with selenium supplementation in children with pneumonia are warranted.",

In a case-control study done in Indian children, a low serum level of vitamin D was associated with severe acute lower-respiratory infections, adjusting for other risk factors [72].

This increased risk is not only for bacterial pneumonia, but also for other causes of pneumonia like M. pneumoniae [79] and RSV [80]. The very low rate of invasive pneumococcal disease observed in Switzerland between 1985 and 1994 has been attributed to the lower rate of day care attendance of Swiss children compared to other European countries [81].

Exposure to smoke during cooking and parental smoking was associated with deaths owing to acute lower-respiratory infections in a case-control study in the Gambia [86]. Maternal smoking (greater than or equal to five cigarettes/day) was associated with upper- and lower-respiratory diseases in a longitudinal study in Chile [82]. In a large prospective study of 1,459 children less than 2 years of age in periurban Lima, Peru, even the exposure of a child to a very low level of household members who smoke (mean consumption 11 cigarettes/week, only 6% of mothers reported smoking) was consistently associated with an increased risk of cough and respiratory illnesses [87]. Environmental exposure to tobacco smoke has been associated clearly with an increased risk of pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, chronic middle ear effusion, and increased frequency and severity of attacks among asthmatics [88, 89]. Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) [90]. The Comparative Risk Assessment Collaborating Group has estimated that smoking may explain 2% of the DALYs lost to lower-respiratory infections in the world [91]. Developing countries are rapidly increasing their rate of maternal and household smoking, the reduction of which should be considered a public health priority. Breast-feeding protects children from this increased risk of lower-respiratory diseases associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke [90, 92], which is another reason for breast-feeding promotion.",

These fuels are usually burned in inefficient stoves or openly within the family room without the use of a chimney, especially in rural areas in the highlands. Children exposed to these sources of indoor air pollution have increased risk of respiratory illnesses. In Nepal, the risk of severe respiratory diseases increased with the number of hours each infant spent near a stove [94, 95]. In the Gambia, carriage of a child on the mother's back while cooking was associated with acute lower-respiratory infections [96], as was the use of wood-burning stoves by Native Americans [97]. An increased incidence of acute lower-respiratory infection was reported associated with the use of kerosene stoves in India [98], but not in Peru [87].",

This effect seems to be mediated through an inhibition of the inflammatory response of alveolar macrophages by PM10 exposure, as documented with RSV infections [99]. Not only may indoor sources of air contaminants be important, but also environmental air pollution may play a role as a risk factor for pneumonia, especially among atopic individuals [100]. It has been estimated that indoor smoke from solid fuels explains 36% of DALYs lost to lower-respiratory infections in the world [91], while urban ambient air pollution may explain about 1% of mortality due to acute respiratory infections in children less than 5 years of age in the world [101].",

Viral infections, particularly with RSV or influenza virus, also predispose to invasive pneumococcal disease for a period of 4 weeks [105]. In a case-control study in Brazil, wheezing disorders were associated with a sevenfold increased risk of pneumonia in children, controlling for other factors [106]. On the other hand, prior acute lower-respiratory infections (croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia) were also a risk factor for wheezing in infancy [20]. But, prior infection does not always seem to be a risk factor. Infections in early life seem to be related to the chances of developing asthma and allergic disorders later in life. An initial report from Japan documented that children 12 years old who had a positive tuberculin response predicted a lower incidence of asthma, lower serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and the predominance of a cytokine profile not associated with atopy [107]. This report was used to postulate that the reduction of early childhood infections, such as tuberculosis, owing to development and better living standards may be one reason for the increase in asthma and atopy observed in developed societies in the last 20 years [108].",

Some studies in developing countries have found supporting evidence for this hypothesis, with higher prevalence of atopic diseases and history of asthma in children in urban areas in Turkey [110] and Chinese [111] children; in contrast, the history of acute gastroenteritis, fever, and antibiotic use during infancy was associated with later development of asthma in Korean children [112]. Some have postulated that rather than environmental exposure to pathogens, persistent infections with certain microorganisms, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, may explain later development of asthma [113]. Others have suggested that lifestyle changes related to obesity may be the link with asthma and developed areas [114]. Systematic reviews of the literature also provided conflicting results regarding the hygiene hypothesis [115, 116], indicating that the association of an increased prevalence of asthma, eczema, and atopy in developed countries may be multifactorial, relating to the host, nutritional status, and environment, among other factors yet to be explained.",

Other conditions prevalent in developing countries, like sickle-cell disease, are also associated with an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae infections [120].

Studies done in developed countries generally report cases diagnosed by physicians on clinical grounds, sometimes complemented by chest X-rays. In contrast, studies conducted in developing countries usually are based on diagnosis from respiratory signs and symptoms reported by the mother or identified by field-workers. Even though the presence of cough, rapid respiratory rates, and other respiratory signs are highly suggestive of pneumonia, as promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) case-management guidelines, it is difficult to distinguish very clearly between pneumonia and other types of acute lower-respiratory infections, especially in community-based prospective studies [122, 123].",

High variability exists on the normal respiratory-rate-by-age, which at some ages is very similar (within 1 SD) of the cutoff value used by WHO to consider that a child has tachypnea [124]. The technique used to measure the respiratory rate is also important [125]. Physical signs on chest examination have important variations when repeat observations are done with one or multiple observers [126]. Even chest X-rays may be negative in the presence of pneumonia proven by postmortem examination in children [127]. To complicate the issue further, rates will change if cases are identified at health facilities when mothers decide to bring their children for care (passive surveillance) as compared with frequent home visits by trained field-workers to identify respiratory infections (active surveillance). Because of these variables, studies using passive surveillance and chest X-ray to diagnose pneumonia report the lowest rates, and studies using active surveillance and symptom-based diagnosis of acute lower-respiratory infections report the highest rates. Because of these reasons, the comparison of acute lower-respiratory infection or pneumonia rates across studies and countries may not be valid and should be taken with caution if the methods used are not similar.",

In Guatemala, the highest rates were noted from January through July. Two peaks were observed in the Philippines, one in January and one in October. Seasonality was also observed for acute lower-respiratory infections in different location, but the patterns did not necessarily coincide with that for acute respiratory infections overall [134]. This variation is most likely owing to the mixture of pneumonia and wheezing disorders that are combined by the methodology used in these initial studies. Wheezing disorders or infections by RSV are more seasonal than pneumococcal or H. influenzae infections in tropical developing countries, being more common in winter or cold months [82]. Mortality owing to acute lower-respiratory infections, more so in neonates, is also higher in winter months [135].",

Volunteer studies with rhinoviruses after exposure to cold and to high humidity failed to demonstrate an increased risk of infection com-pared to a warm and dry environment [136]. Epidemiological studies done in England have also failed to demonstrate an association between indoor temperature and humidity and respiratory infections [137]. Most likely, cold weather induces individuals to reduce ventilation indoors, and the crowding that results from remaining indoors increases the risk of respiratory infections rather than the cold directly affecting the health. There is a need to better document this lack of association to clarify this issue.",

In a prospective home surveillance study done in Peru of respiratory signs and symptoms by frequent (twice weekly) home visits by trained field-workers, it was shown that cough and phlegm started developing 10\u201312 days prior to the diagnosis of pneumonia by a physician or a positive chest X-ray. It was also found that patients took 10\u201312 days to recover after diagnosis [122]. Rapid breathing, fever, loss of appetite, and ill appearance, as reported by the mother, appeared between 5 and 8 days prior to diagnosis and lasted 5\u20138 days after the diagnosis (except fever that disappeared in 24 hours after starting antibiotics) [122]. Thus, the duration of symptoms is related to their severity as well as to early treatment with antibiotics. Based on this study, it could be said that most respiratory signs and symptoms associated with pneumonia in the community usually would last no more than 15 days if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.",

Females have been reported to have an increased case fatality [134, 143]. In malnourished children, pneumonia is a predictor of mortality [149]. Gambian children who were hospitalized with severe pneumonia and survived were followed up after discharge from the hospital [150]. It was found that children who were malnourished while in the hospital had a threefold greater risk of death after being sent home than children without malnutrition, indicating the importance of nutritional recovery in the hospital before a patient is sent home [150].",

In areas that do not have malaria, the presence of fever may increase the specificity without much drop in the sensitivity [123, 160], increasing its positive predictive value.

Bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is usually associated with high fever, increased WBC counts, and ill appearance [163]; in 80% of cases, they had a lobar pneumonia. However, in a prospective study done in Brazil, respiratory signs and symptoms did not distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia [164]. Also, the majority of clinically diagnosed cases of pneumonia in outpatient settings in developing countries do not have an abnormal chest X-ray, even though they do respond to antibiotic treatment, indicating the importance of clinical judgment over X-ray or laboratory parameters [165].",

Of children infected with RSV, 30% have pneumonia; bronchiolitis is the most common clinical presentation [172]. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has been clearly recognized [173]. Epithelial cells are initially involved in an inflammatory response, in which cytokines and chemokines released from inflammatory cells trigger further inflammatory responses, which are more common in susceptible children with a family history of asthma or atopy [173, 174]. Recent studies have suggested that RSV may enhance the development of an allergic inflammatory response in susceptible hosts when exposed to allergens after being infected with RSV [175]. Other important viral causes of acute lower-respiratory infections are adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus [176, 177].",

Cultures taken from the trachea or throat are invalid because they are usually contaminated by bacteria that grow in those settings, not necessarily representing the cause of the pneumonia. In cultured specimens taken from sterile sites (blood or lung tissue) in children with acute lower-respiratory infections, the most commonly identified bacterial pathogen has generally been S. pneumoniae, followed by H. influenzae [134, 138, 170, 171, 189]. Other important pathogens include Bordetella pertussis and M. pneumoniae. Pneumonia in cases with pertussis has been reported in 9.4% of cases, with the severity of the disease greater among infants less than 6 months old [190]. Pertussis in the very young infant or in individuals previously immunized can also occur. In very young infants, the disease is atypical and severe, requiring hospitalization [191]. In previously immunized individuals, pertussis is mild, prolonged (> 4 weeks of symptoms), and atypical [192]. Despite the worldwide use of pertussis immunization, the incidence of pertussis has not been reduced as expected [193]. Pertussis still occurs, causing severe morbidity and mortality in unimmunized or partially immunized children, usually infected from adults or adolescents who have waning vaccine-induced immunity [194]. In some endemic areas, Chlamydia trachomatis should also be considered in cases with pneumonia, especially if the individual has concurrent conjunctivitis [195]. As with M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae is also a cause of pneumonia epidemics in schoolchildren and adults [196]. Mixed infections with different pathogens may occur.",

Organisms frequently isolated in young infants in developed countries, like Salmonella group B and Streptococcus agalactiae, were rarely isolated. However, in a similar study done in the Philippines [203], Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp., and gram-negative organisms were more common than S. pneumoniae, indicating that the pattern observed in developed countries may also be present in some developing countries. Further studies on the etiology of severe infectious diseases in infants under 3 months of age are needed. Because of the newly recognized need to protect against S. pneumoniae infection in young infants, WHO is now evaluating the use of maternal immunization to protect neonates [204, 205].",

In general, the immune defenses in the lung are provided by a cough reflex, action of cilia in the tracheobronchial tree, mucus secretion by goblet cells, and phagocytic activity by alveolar macrophages. Pneumonia occurs when pathogenic organisms overwhelm these host defenses and infection occurs in the lower-respiratory tract. In the affected portion of the lung, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, erythrocytes, and proteinaceous secretions are present, and consolidation occurs, which may appear as a homogeneous density on chest radiograph. In general, consolidation occurs less among young infants. The affected individual may develop fever, tachycardia, and cyanosis, and sputum production may be present. Phagocytosis, antibody responses, and other immune mechanisms usually allow recovery from pneumonia within several days to a couple of weeks.",

Studies in dogs with pneumonia induced by inoculation with S. pneumoniae [211] or Pseudomonas aeruginosa [212] revealed that the exudate produced in the site of infection reduces the gas exchanged by filling the alveoli, preventing them from inflation. This causes a reduction in the total lung capacity as well as in the functional residual capacity, proportional to the magnitude of the lung involved. The lung reacts with hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction in the affected area, initially thought to be an attempt to divert blood to ventilated lung tissues to maintain a high oxygen tension in the blood [213]. This, however, is not effective, and blood goes through the pneumonic, unventilated tissue, creating an arterial-venous shunt, which explains the hypoxia seen in severe pneumonia [214]. This pulmonary vasoconstriction induces pulmonary hypertension, which in severe pneumonia causes right ventricular cardiac failure, a condition that is associated with increased mortality and that does not respond to digoxin therapy [215]. Very few children with right ventricular failure will manifest the typical clinical signs of hepatomegaly, tachycardia, raised jugular venous pressure, or peripheral edema. They usually only have dilation of the right ventricle on ultrasound examination of the heart [215].",

Intrapulmonary blood shunt is not the only reason for hypoxia because the pneumonic tissue increases its consumption of oxygen, and at the same time, fever and infection also increase the oxygen requirements in the rest of the body [217]. The involvement of lung tissue by pneumonia also causes a reduction of lung compliance and an increase in the work of breathing. In the dog model, administration of intravenous fluids that could increase the plasma volume and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is associated with large increases in lobar wet weights of the affected pneumonic lung, probably owing in part to transudation of plasma and crystalloid into alveolar spaces [218]. The magnitude of the intrapulmonary shunt may be increased by endogenous vasodilator mediators, exogenous systemically administered vasodilator drugs, positioning the patient with the affected lung down, and increasing the positive airway pressure by mechanical ventilation [219]. Factors that reduce shunt include effective hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, inhaled locally acting vasodilators that act primarily on the ventilated lung, and positioning the patient with the affected lung up [219]. The blood's oxygen saturation is improved if the patient is in prone position rather than in supine position [220]. The administration of aerosolized vasodilators may be beneficial to patients by improving their ventilation in the ventilated lung, thereby improving the blood's oxygen tension [221].",

Pulmonary surfactant is a complex material composed of lipids and proteins; it is found in the fluid lining of the alveolar surface of the lungs. Surfactant prevents alveolar collapse at low lung volume and preserves bronchiolar patency during normal and forced respiration [222]. It is also involved in the protection of the lung from injuries and infections caused by inhaled particles or microorganisms [222]. Pulmonary surfactant is absent in prematurity and is one of the reasons for respiratory distress syndrome and hyaline membrane disease in premature newborns [222]. But, surfactant abnormalities are also present in various degrees in asthma, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, and HIV infections [222]. Natural and synthetic surfactants are now available for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in infants [223].",

In an elegant prospective study done in Taiwan, respiratory function was assessed by a single-occlusion technique and rapid thoracic compression technique in a group of infants at a mean of 2 months who were then followed for 2 years [226]. Infants who developed a subsequent attack of wheezing had low values of total respiratory compliance corrected for body weight compared with those infants who did not develop a wheezing attack. This study indicated that differences in lung function in early life, for reasons yet to be understood, predispose infants to acute lower-respiratory infection with wheezing disorders in their first 2 years of life.",

In a prospective study of a small cohort of Gambian children, acute lower-respiratory infections diagnosed by a pediatrician were associated with a loss of 14.7 g of weight per day of illness, greater than the reduction observed with diarrheal diseases [229]. Because of their higher prevalence, however, diarrheal diseases explained one half of weight loss, and acute lower-respiratory infections only accounted for 25% of observed weight deficit. One study in the Philippines documented the impact of febrile respiratory illness on weight gain [230]. In Papua New Guinea, weight gain was reduced during episodes of acute lower-respiratory infections in young children [231]. A large longitudinal study in Brazil suggested that hospitalization for pneumonia and subsequent height-for-age are significantly associated [18], and acute respiratory infections had a negative impact on weight gain in Guatemala [232].",

An algorithm based on clinical signs was developed to facilitate the recognition and management of acute respiratory infections by non-specialist doctors working in small hospitals with limited facilities [238, 239]. Several intervention studies using a case-management strategy for pneumonia were conducted in several developing countries. A meta-analysis of intervention trials on case management of pneumonia in nine community settings showed that the case-management strategy has a substantial effect on neonate, infant, and under 5 mortality rates, at least in settings where infant mortality rates are 49/1,000 live births or greater [240, 241]. Despite differences in study populations (location, immunization coverage, diarrhea management, prevalence of malnutrition, health services availability, maternal literacy, and infant mortality rates) and antibiotic (penicillin, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole) treatment in the different intervention trials, there was a consistent impact of case management on pneumonia mortality in neonates, infants, and children 1\u20134 years old. Case management of pneumonia was associated with a summary estimate from the pooled studies of 42% reduction (95% confidence interval [CI] 22\u201357%) of neonatal pneumonia mortality, of a 36% reduction (95% CI 20\u201348%) of infant pneumonia mortality, and of a 36% reduction (95% CI 20\u201349%) of pneumonia mortality among children 0\u20134 years old [241]. Reductions of total mortality by 27% (95% CI 18\u201335%) in neonates, 20% (95% CI 11\u201328%) in infants, and 24% (95% CI 14\u201333%) in children 0\u20134 years of age were also observed [241].",

No effect on wheezing disorders was observed in these trials [59]. Zinc gluconate glycine lozenges have been suggested as a therapy for the common cold [242\u2013244]. Initial meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials have suggested that zinc lozenges may be effective in the reduction of cold symptoms in adults and children, but the studies had many problems, including zinc dose; inadequate placebo control, and various formulations of the lozenge, which may include citric acid, sorbitol, mannitol, or tartaric acid, which may bind free zinc ion in the mouth, reducing its therapeutic effect [242, 243]. Initial zinc lozenges were associated with adverse effects in general, with bad taste and nausea as prominent symptoms [245]. Recent done trials, however, have documented that zinc lozenges were associated with reduction of duration and severity of cold symptoms [246, 247], especially when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms [248]. The use of zinc nasal sprays, gels, or lozenges given intranasally have caused important side effects and are not recommended [249, 250].",

In humans, it was recognized early that patients on total parenteral nutrition who developed selenium deficiency had a marked reduction in erythrocyte and granulocyte glutathione peroxidase activity, which inhibits the cell's capacity to metabolize H2O2, abnormalities that returned to normal after selenium supplementation [252]. In critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, the frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia, organ system failure, and mortality (especially in those who developed a systemic inflammatory response syndrome), were three times higher in patients with low plasma selenium concentration on admission [253]. This fall in plasma concentration of selenium seems to occur mostly in patients with septicemia or pneumonia compared with those who develop viral infections [254, 255]. In a double-blind, controlled trial in Chinese children, selenium supplementation in children hospitalized with pneumonia or bronchiolitis associated with RSV resulted in a faster recovery rate of specific respiratory signs or symptoms [66]. Selenium supplements have also improved clinical signs of children with M. pneumoniae [67], and food additives containing selenium have improved symptoms in children admitted with pneumonia in Russian hospitals [68, 69]. Further trials are needed to document the value of selenium in the management of acute lower-respiratory infections in children.",

Increasing immunization coverage with measles vaccine and with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine would be expected to lower the deaths from these two vaccine-preventable causes of acute respiratory infections [256]. The seven-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has been safe and effective against pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease in children in the United States and was introduced for universal immunization in children in 2000 [257]. The effect of this vaccine introduction was greater in adults not vaccinated but protected by herd immunity by their children's immunization [257]. A protective effect was also observed for antibiotic-resistant invasive pneumococcal infections in children and adults in the United States [258]. This vaccine also reduces the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type S. pneumoniae serotypes, which are replaced by nonvaccine types [259]. Recent reports from the United States indicate that these replacing serotypes are causing a greater proportion of invasive disease than before, which is a concern over the long-term benefits of this vaccine [257, 258]. The effect of this vaccine on the prevention of acute otitis media is questionable [260], although it may reduce tympanostomy tube placement in children [261]. A nine-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine was tested in a large group of infants in the Gambia, where it was documented not only to be 37% effective against radiological pneumonia, 77% effective against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine-related serotypes, and 15% against all-cause hospital admissions, but also was 16% effective in reducing mortality [262]. This nine-valent vaccine was also effective in South African infants, mostly among those who were not infected with HIV [263]. The seven-valent vaccine is now licensed for commercial use in several developing countries, but due to its high price, its use in public immunization programs will not happen soon. Other pneumococcal vaccines are under the horizon that may allow their introduction in developing countries.",

In 2002, it was recommended to be used in US children 6\u201323 months of age [266], and several Latin American countries have also introduced it in young children. A new, cold-adapted, live influenza vaccine has proved not only immunogenic in young infants but also more effective in preventing influenza illness than the inactivated influenza vaccine [267]. However, the use of the cold-adapted trivalent intranasal influenza virus vaccine in children and adolescents has been associated with an increased risk of asthma or reactive airway disease in children younger than 36 months [268]. This risk may be related to the intranasal route of administration since the use of a live attenuated trivalent influenza vaccine in children and adolescents has not been observed to increase the risk of asthma [272], including when it was tested in children and adolescents with asthma [270]. Finally, the use of the BCG vaccine in infants has been cost-effective in preventing severe childhood tuberculosis and should continue to be used [271].",

In patients with major burns, supplementation with selenium combined with copper and zinc was associated with fewer bronchopneumonia infections and with a shorter hospital stay in a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial [276]. Selenium has also been incriminated in the pathogenesis of asthma. It has been postulated that the combination of dietary, environmental, and genetic factors that decrease the cellular reducing capacity will increase tissue vulnerability to oxidant stress. This will result in inflammation and tissue damage in the respiratory system and later in immune damage, leading to an increased risk to develop asthma [277]. Severely malnourished children often have very low plasma selenium concentrations and low erythrocyte and plasma glutathione peroxidase activity, which may predispose them to the development of serious infections [278]. Controlled, randomized, double-blind trials are needed with selenium supplementation for treatment or prevention of respiratory illnesses in children; toxicity should be also closely monitored [279].",

Although a considerable number of studies have been conducted to measure the incidence and clinical characteristics of these illnesses, there is still a need to standardize the methodology to be used in the field. Physician-based diagnostic methodologies seem to be preferable to symptom-based definitions of pneumonia, which are not capable of adequately separating pneumonia from wheezing disorders and other acute lower-respiratory infections; this explains the great variability of the rates reported in studies using that methodology.
