Seven genes were identified in nematodes, termed SMG1\u20137 (suppressor with morphological effect on genitalia proteins 1\u20137). Mutations to SMG were non-lethal, indicating that NMD is not essential in nematodes [9]. Three orthologous genes to SMG2, SMG3 and SMG4, UPF1\u20133 (up-frameshift 1\u20133), were identified in S. cerevisiae [10]. Homology searches continued to identify orthologous genes in other species, including Arabidopsis, Drosophila and mammals [11].",

The EJC complex recruits the evolutionarily conserved UPF proteins and plays an essential role in NMD [15]. During the pioneer round of translation, some EJC components are displaced by the ribosome, and this positional information by EJC is preserved until the mRNA is translated [15,16]. In the presence of a PTC, translation pauses upstream of an EJC and the eukaryotic release factors (eRF) physically bind and recruit UPF1 (the RNA helicase) [17,18,19]. The eRFs recognize the stop codon, and when the mRNA stop codon enters the ribosomal A site, the termination of the protein synthesis occurs. The single eukaryotic class-I RF eRF1 recognizes all three (UAG, UGA, UAA) stop codons [20].",

UPF3b attaches to the EJC and anchors UPF2. The SURF complex binds with the UPF2, UPF3b and an EJC downstream of the PTC, forming the decay-inducing complex (DECID) [21]. Along with the UPF proteins the SURF complex promotes the phosphorylation of UPF1 by SMG1. In contrast, for the dephosphorylation of UPF1 a multiprotein complex composed of SMG5, SMG6, SMG7 and protein phosphatase 2A is required [22]. Allowing for the fine-tuning of the NMD activity, the UPF3a protein inhibits NMD, and this activity is regulated by the UPF3b protein [23].",

            "text": "The main component of the NMD machinery is the UPF1/SMG2 protein, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, which undergoes cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that are essential for NMD progression. The UPF1 protein is involved in the translation termination complex, when an EJC lies downstream of a termination event. UPF1 undergoes a large conformational change upon binding with UPF2 protein, which activates its RNA-helicase activity [24,25,26]. Once the RNA-helicase is active, the RNA is exposed for degradation. The DEAH box polypeptide 34 (DHX34; Figure 1a), an RNA helicase of the DEAH box family, associates with several components of the NMD complex in cell lysates, and preferentially binds with the hypophosphorylated UPF1 [27,28,29]. It is proposed that DHX34 is involved in the activation of UPF1 phosphorylation, and mediates a change in interaction patterns within the NMD, which propagates NMD activation [28,29,30].",

The UPF2 structure consists of four core regions, three domains are the middle portion of eukaryotic initiation factor 4-gamma (MIF4G-1, 2 and 3) domains and a C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain of the UPF2 protein plays an important functional role, as it binds to the UPF1 CH-domain, enhancing its helicase activity [34]. Particularly, the MIF4G-3 domain interacts with the RRM (RNA recognition motif) domain of the UPF3b protein (Figure 1b) [36], as well as the SMG1 protein interacts with the MIF4G-3 domain at the same time as UPF3b, but in a non-competitive way [37]. Both UPF3a and UPF3b proteins do not show direct binding to the RNA, despite having a RNP domain (ribonucleoprotein or RRM) at the N-terminus (Figure 1b) [38].",

Varying between the organism or cell type, ~5\u201320% of the transcripts can be subjected to NMD and these targets extend beyond the classical understanding of this machinery. Beyond mRNA with PTC in coding regions, a number of features can target different RNA-species for degradation by NMD. Additional targets can be classified into three main categories: (1) transcripts with destabilizing PTC arising in pseudogenes [5], or from alternative splicing events leading to the intron retention or inclusion of PTC-containing exons [4]. (2) Transcripts with limited or no clear coding potential, such as small RNAs derived from intragenic regions [44], long non-coding RNAs [31] and mRNAs of inactivated transposons [5]. (3) Transcripts with upstream open reading frames, or with abnormally long 3\u2032UTRs, or wild-type mRNAs with no atypical features [5]. It has been demonstrated that the NMD process can occur even without the presence of EJC bound to the mRNA. In this pathway, UPF1 binds to the 3\u2032 UTRs of the transcript and interacts with exon\u2013exon junction components found in the cytoplasm or EJC stably associated with 3\u2032 UTRs. The mechanism of this process is still not fully understood.",

The study demonstrated a vital SMG1 function in early mouse development and linked the loss of this NMD component to the widespread changes in the mammalian transcriptome [59].",

Stress mitigation can involve the repression of NMD as seen for stresses including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia or infection [15,53]. Inhibition of NMD is partially mediated by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2, which stops the translation process and is a common step in several stress response schemes [61]. Downregulation of NMD pathway activity allows for the accumulation of NMD-targeted transcripts, including stress-response-factors and this increases cell survival [61].",

While a physiologically beneficial pathway, the UPR requires tight regulation to avoid deleterious consequences. A persistent activation of the UPR is a cause of a wide variety of human diseases, therefore the unfolded protein response pathway must undergo a strict regulation. In a physiological state, NMD protects cells from the overactivation of UPR. Under stress conditions, NMD inhibition triggers UPR response through the upregulation of UPR sensors such as IRE1. However, as a consequence of inhibition, an accumulation of truncated misfolded proteins in the ER, leads to a cellular stress signal. NMD re-activation then helps end the stress response and leads to homeostasis [53]. ",

One way to escape the decay pathway is through integrating a stability element in 3\u2032 UTR that may prevent UPF1 function [65]. On the other hand, the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) virus uses Tax and Rex proteins to inhibit NMD by interaction with UPF1. Tax induces the accumulation of phosphorylated UPF1 in P-bodies which leads to enhanced stability of HTLV-1 mRNAs [66]. Waga et al. demonstrated that mRNA of coronaviruses (CoV) show multiple features that subject them to the NMD pathway, such as multiple open-reading frames (ORFs) with internal STOP codons that make up a long 3\u2032 UTR. This led to the conclusion that CoVs evolved a strategy to inhibit the NMD pathway. The study identified that nucleocapsid protein inhibits NMD protecting viral RNAs from decay and leading to the efficient replication of the coronavirus. The process of NMD inhibition has been shown to promote accumulation of viral transcripts at the early stage of infection. Considering the role that NMD plays in regulation of stress and immune responses, inhibition of host NMD activity by nucleocapsid protein contributes to the pathogenicity of CoVs [67].",

This strategy depends on small-molecule read-through agents [77] that induce the translation machinery to ignore the PTC and instead recode it as an amino acid. The resulting full-length protein is potentially functional, ameliorating the disease. Aminoglycosides were used to cause read-through of termination codons by the misincorporation of amino acids corresponding to near-cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) [78]. Gentamicin, another readthrough agent, has been utilized in clinical trials for cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These trials showed the efficacy of this readthrough agent in restoring protein function. Unfortunately, the high doses of gentamicin required to achieve clinical utility in treatment may have adverse effects [79,80]. Ataluren has been pitched as an alternative with reported selectively in promoting PTC read-through over normal stop codons. However, the molecular mechanism of action has been challenged and its future use in clinics will largely depend on the patient outcomes of currently ongoing clinical trials [81].",

These somatic point mutations were clustered in two regions of the UPF1 gene. Many seem to trigger alternative splicing of the UPF1 pre-mRNA, leading to the expression of truncated UPF1 proteins [81]. Similarly, UPF1 expression is shown to be lower in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) when compared to normal tissue. This characteristic leads to the decrease of NMD activity, which can lead to the upregulation of genes typically under NMD control. For example, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signalling components, which are vital to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During EMT, epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion [89].",

            "text": "Translation is necessary for NMD [107]; thus, it is suggested that inhibitors of translation may also be effective inhibitors of NMD [104]. Moreover, Martin et al. have recently demonstrated that NMD inhibition can be achieved via other mechanisms [16,93] and also determined that 80% depletion of UPF1 can suppress NMD activity not influencing the proliferation or survival of cells [55,93]. Therefore, inhibitors that can modulate NMD activity offer critical tools for understanding the mechanism and physiological functions of the NMD pathway [75,108]. Targeting protein-protein interaction binding sites is crucial in drug discovery, since many physiological and pathological cellular processes depend on protein-protein interactions that can be influenced by compounds or peptide-like molecules [16]. Although, previous studies have identified NMD inhibitors with different mechanisms of action (e.g., NMDI-1 disrupts UPF1-SMG5 interactions), there are several interactions and active-sites left to exploit and study. Three-dimensional protein structures can reveal the precise interactions defining the protein-protein interface for in silico drug design, which can be targeted for drug discovery [109,110,111]. These protein-protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) [111] for NMD pathway are (Figure 2 and Table 1): UPF1-UPF2 [34], UPF2-UPF3b [36], SMG5-SMG7 [103,105,112], SMG8-SMG9 [104,106], SMG1\u2013SMG8\u2013SMG9 [107] and the EJC (Mago-Y14-eIF4AIII-Barentsz-UPF3b) [108]. Figure 2, illustrates different protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions from the NMD pathways that could represent a base or the platform to design inhibitors or peptide-like molecules.",

Because of its involvement in maintaining the genome stability, disruptions in this strictly regulated surveillance pathway lead to pathologies including neurological disorders, immune diseases and cancers. The role of NMD in cancer development is complex. In some cases, NMD acts to support tumour growth by downregulation of key tumour suppressor genes.
