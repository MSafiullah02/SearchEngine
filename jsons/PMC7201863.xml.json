This is mainly applicable to adult patients, however. We use criteria shown in Table 1, which we made for donor children, taking the above guidelines into account as well. As we accumulated more experience with this program, we found that applying it to children was not so difficult, as long as they were cooperative\n2\n and as long as we did not have to adhere to strict criteria for selection by age or body weight. As a rule, approximately 10 percent of intravascular blood volume was drawn once a week in a bag containing citrate phosphate dextrose adenine anticoagulant, if the Hb level before each donation was 11 g per dL or more.\n7\n No blood was collected within 3 days of an operation. Autologous blood was stored in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C until the operation. Blood not used within a permissible storage period of 5 weeks was therefore returned to the patient for rejuvenation, followed by another donation to secure a sufficient amount of blood at the time of surgery. This liquid storage method is called the leap\u2010frog.\n8\n When the blood volume to be drawn was small, the amount of anticoagulant (blood volume, \u00d70.14 mL) was adjusted with a sterile connection device (SCD), which connects two tubes of different sizes.\n8\n Usually, each adult patient received 200 mg of oral iron sulfate daily; for children the dose was 4 mg per kg per day. In addition to iron supplementation, recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was prescribed for patients with anemia who required more than 800 mL of autologous blood within a shorter donation period.",

In the early years after introduction of this program into our hospital, patients with extremely small veins were sometimes excluded as donor patients. Currently, however, by use of an SCD or a blood bag specially designed for children, drawing blood from children with narrow veins has become much easier than it was before. Figure 1 illustrates how to use the special blood bag (TERUFLEX; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Recently, when we found it difficult to draw blood at our department due to, for example, restlessness or narrow veins, the blood draw was performed at the time of cardiac catheter examination.\n9\n\n",

Autologous blood donation was not indicated for 7 children (2.2%, 7/314) and for 173 adults (3.2%, 173/5478) due to various reasons listed in Table 2. Restlessness, excitement, uncooperative behavior, and extremely narrow veins were the main problems related to children's phlebotomy, whereas problems with adult patients were poor general condition, virus\u2010carrier state, and retention of inserted catheter. In Japan, patients who are virus carriers are, as a rule, not candidates for autologous blood donors because of the following four main reasons: 1) the benefits of autologous blood are quite reduced, 2) mishandling of blood of those patients may transfer the infection to someone else, 3) doctors and/or nurses may suffer viral infection by pricks with needles contaminated with infectious organisms, and 4) equipment may be polluted due to torn blood bags. In contrast, the rights of patients undergoing surgery with their own blood should be highly respected. Therefore, in every hospital in Japan, autologous blood donation programs for those patients are carried out very carefully, taking into consideration the above factors.",

Bradycardia was not observed. Only one 14\u2010year\u2010old boy (UPN 4) developed a remarkably low blood pressure (49/22 mmHg).

The motivations behind this method are well understood. The real utility of the method, however, as well as its most relevant problems, seem obscure. A major factor in the broad support for this program is the psychological relief felt by children and/or their parents when they undergo an operation with their own blood. The purpose of this report is to reveal problems with children's autologous blood donation that we have encountered during our 19\u2010year experience.
