During the last two decades, herbal medicines have expanded globally and gained considerable attention because of low toxicity and good therapeutical performance [1]. Unfortunately, the quantification and quality of safety and efficacy data about the herbal medicines are far from sufficiency to satisfy the regulation supporting the world widely uses of these medicines. One of the main reasons lies on the lack of reliable and acceptable strategy for the quality evaluation of the herbal medicines [2], [3], [4], [5].",

However, for the herbal medicines the safety and efficacy are not just attributed to one or several particular compounds, because it is well known that a herbal medicine is one complex mixture containing dozens, even hundreds of chemical components which are usually responsible for the therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the interactions among these components make their relationship to the safety and efficacy much more complicated than that occurs in the western medicines. Therefore, quality evaluation of the herbal medicines, unlike that of the western medicines, is beyond the ability of routine analysis, which focuses on the single or a few marker components. Taking into account the direct quantification of as many as possible components is in common thought to evaluate the quality of the herbal medicines. However, it would be impossible because most reference components are not commercially available; moreover, most of the herbal medicines are so complex that the procedure of separation, identification and determination of numbers of components is rather tedious for the pharmaceutical quality evaluation.",

Nowadays, this technique has been suggested to check the authenticity or quality evaluation of the herbal medicines by WHO [11], and it is also required by the State Food and Drug Administration of China to standardize the injections made from the herbal medicines [12]. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the commonly used technique for fingerprinting due to its high resolution, reproducibility and reliability [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [13], [14], [15]. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is becoming increasingly recognized as an important separation technique, due to its high resolution, small sample volumes, extraordinary small solvents consumption and rapid separation with high efficiency. Recently, several studies on the chromatographic fingerprinting using CE technique have been reported [16], [17], [18].",

Its root has been used for the treatment of bronchitis, hepatitis, tumors, and inflammatory diseases. Some concentrated composite herbal preparations containing this herb as a major ingredient are widely used in China [19]. The main active components are many kinds of flavones compounds such as Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin (their chemical structures have been presented in Fig. 1\n). Baicalin is the most abundant component, and it has anti-inflammatory [20], anti-HIV [21], anti-tumor [22] and anti-SARS coronavirus effects [23]. The activity of baicalein is similar with that of baicalin. Wogonin possesses anti-respiratory syncytial virus [24] and anti-tumor effects [22].",

In the present study, quantitative analysis and chromatographic fingerprint with CE technique was developed for the quality evaluation of S. baicalensis. The roots of S. baicalensis (34 samples in all), collected from different geographical origins of China, were analyzed. The combination of central composite design and multivariate analysis was employed to find an optimal CE condition. Three active components (Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin) were determined with the optimized CE condition.

Preliminary experiments with different buffers showed that capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) gave poor resolution, due to the fact that most components in this raw material were chemically in neutral character. Therefore, micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC) mode was employed for the further investigation. The mixture of 20 mM borate and 30 mM phosphate was chosen as the aqueous buffer because it provided a relative better separation. SDS was chosen as the surfactant. Organic modifiers were commonly used for method development of MEKC. It was shown that the simultaneous addition of acetonitrile and 2-propanol into the buffer offered a better separation. However, some components were still not well separated, and the running time (about 25 min) was too long for CE analysis.
