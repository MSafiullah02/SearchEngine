            "text": "Studies of the built environment have identified features and attributes of neighborhoods that may confer health benefits to residents, though relatively fewer of those studies have focused on disadvantaged populations. Recently, Smith et al. (2017) reviewed studies of the built environment and self-reported or objectively measured physical activity (PA), finding associations between activity and features such as walkability, presence of parks and infrastructure supportive of active transport. Few of the studies reviewed considered socioeconomic status or race-ethnicity, though two such studies found some evidence that disadvantaged individuals were less likely to use improved parks and new walking and cycling paths (Smith et al., 2017). Lovasi et al. (2009) reviewed studies of the built environment, obesity, and obesity-related health behaviors among individuals of low socioeconomic status, black race, or Hispanic ethnicity. In the studies reviewed, subjective and objective assessments of the built environment included features such as presence of fast food restaurants, walkability, and environmental disorder. Findings across studies were somewhat inconsistent, though several environmental characteristics appear more likely to improve obesity among disadvantaged populations, namely, access to healthy foods and places to exercise, and perceived safety (Lovasi et al., 2009). Casagrande et al. (2009) also reviewed studies of the built environment, focusing on self-reported physical activity, diet and obesity or body mass index (BMI) among African Americans. In the studies that investigated physical activity or BMI as outcomes, exposures included participants\u2019 assessments of built environmental features such as traffic, presence of sidewalks, street lighting at night, distance to destinations and perceived safety. Several studies in the review found light traffic, sidewalks and safety from crime were associated with physical activity. One study found higher BMI among individuals who reported barriers to physical activity (Casagrande et al., 2009).",

A longitudinal assessment of the built environment, physical activity, BMI and neighborhood satisfaction was conducted in two low-income, African American communities in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, which are the primary focus of this study (Dubowitz et al., 2019). A natural experimental design was used to track participants\u2019 activity, BMI, and neighborhood satisfaction before and after one of the neighborhoods received investments that improved the built environment, such as new residential buildings, sidewalks, and street crossings. However, physical activity and BMI were not found to be significantly different between participants living in the intervention and comparison neighborhoods. Gustat et al. (2012) conducted a natural experiment in a low-income, African American neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. A walking path and a new school playground designed to increase physical activity were installed in one neighborhood. Before and after the installation, self-reported physical activity of adult household members and observed physical activity were collected in the intervention neighborhood and two comparison neighborhoods. Observed activity increased in the intervention neighborhood and decreased in the comparison neighborhoods after the improvements were made. This finding was consistent with the theory that improvements in the built environment in a specific location would impact activity in the neighborhood overall (Gustat et al., 2012).",

A study of African American adults and older adults living in urban areas of Detroit, MI (Gothe, 2018), investigated social and physical attributes associated with physical activity, measured using self-report and objective data (accelerometry). Physical activity was associated with self-efficacy but not with subjective perceptions of the environment such as accessibility, walkability, aesthetics, and crime. However, in focus groups, study participants reported that crime and access to places to exercise were barriers to physical activity (Gothe, 2018). Tung et al. (2016) studied perceived access to nearby health-enabling resources and objectively measured BMI in a high poverty urban setting in Chicago, IL, USA. Distance and travel time to the nearest health-promoting resource and nearest utilized resource were included in models predicting BMI. Participant BMI was positively associated with travel time to the utilized grocery store. Bypassing grocery stores nearer to home resulted in longer travel time or distance, both of which were associated with higher BMI (Tung et al., 2016).",

Spatial databases with macro-scale data such as land use, often manipulated within a geographic information system (GIS), are another common and important source of built environment data (Brownson et al., 2009).

            "text": "Each audit method has advantages and disadvantages. Google Street View (GSV) is a publicly-available source of environmental data that includes micro-scale features (Steinmetz-Wood et al., 2019). GSV is popular in studies of the built environment (Nguyen et al., 2019) and has established reliability and validity (Badland et al., 2010; Griew et al., 2013). Yet GSV images may not be time-sensitive, image quality can vary across locations (Rzotkiewicz et al., 2018), and imagery from different dates may be combined in GSV representations of places (Curtis et al., 2013). Direct observation provides objective assessments of neighborhood environments but requires coding environmental features in person at the time of observation which is costly (Bader et al., 2015). And inter-rater reliability for direct observation requires that two or more individuals evaluate the same environments contemporaneously. Macro-scale data such as from the U.S. Census or the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) (Homer et al., 2007) are reliable and publicly available and can be linked to places using various geographic scales, but the data may not be not time-sensitive and do not include micro-scale features associated with health promoting behaviors such as physical activity (Boarnet et al., 2011). Although subjective assessments of the built environment may be convenient, less expensive to obtain and time-sensitive, objective measures may be stronger predictors of physical activity (Lin and Moudon, 2010; Zhang et al., 2019).",

GigaPan\u00ae is a robotic system that stitches together numerous high-resolution images derived from a camera housed within the GigaPan\u00ae apparatus to create highly detailed, navigable, panoramic images (http://gigapan.com). GigaPan\u00ae offers several advantages as compared to other audit methods. The contextual information and high-resolution detail captured with GigaPan\u00ae technology are relevant in studies of the built environment. Images can be coded, and inter-rater reliability can be estimated as time permits, providing flexibility to collect time-sensitive data. Although GigaPan\u00ae technology requires taking photographs in the study setting, it provides an alternative to direct observation and GSV for capturing high-resolution, time-sensitive environmental imagery. Research to validate new audit technologies such as GigaPan\u00ae for use in studies of the built environment is needed (Badland et al., 2010).",

In particular, we were interested in whether built environment characteristics derived from GigaPan\u00ae images could serve as valid predictors of physical activity and BMI. This study builds on the Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Neighborhood Change and Health (PHRESH) study of the Hill District and Homewood neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, which are low income, predominantly African American communities. The PHRESH study was designed to evaluate the health of residents following planned changes to the built environment, including introduction of a full-service supermarket in the Hill District neighborhood, and renovation of parks and playgrounds and housing construction and developments (Dubowitz et al. 2015, 2019). A primary aim of the original PHRESH research was to collect data on food shopping in order to evaluate the influence of access to healthy affordable foods on diet, which may influence obesity and diet-related chronic diseases (Dubowitz et al., 2014). Both the Hill District and Homewood neighborhoods are geographically isolated from adjacent neighborhoods, primarily by natural features (elevation) and both neighborhoods lacked a full-service supermarket at the start of the PHRESH study (Dubowitz et al., 2015). In addition, the population in the Hill District and Homewood neighborhoods has declined significantly over time.1\nMaster plans developed with input from community residents include goals such as protection of long-term and low income residents, cultural preservation and provision of improved transportation networks (Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan, 2019) (The Greater Hill District Master Plan, 2011).",

Photos were taken at the midpoint of each street block. Street segment data were collected prior to the follow-up in-home participant survey. Trained staff in Pittsburgh used software provided by GigaPan\u00ae to electronically stitch individual images together to create high-resolution panoramic images of the street environments.

The use of a 0.4 km radial buffer around the residential address is supported by prior research. Specifically, McMillan (2010) tested street segment sampling protocols in low income urban areas with relatively higher minority populations finding that sampling 25% of street segments in a 0.4 km radial buffer provided an adequate representation of the residential walking environment (McMillan et al., 2010).

For example, based on Census data, the percentage of residents in the community who self-defined as black were 84% and 91%, which is similar to the percent who self-defined as black in this study. In addition, the methods applied to construct measures of the environment captured micro-scale characteristics of the neighborhoods that are relevant for urban planning and policy making, particularly because small scale modifications can be implemented incrementally in neighborhood environments to enhance traffic safety and promote active transport (Brown et al., 2017).",

Further, although the recruitment was high and the sample generally demographically representative of the community, the sample was slightly older than the community population, more likely to be female and less likely to have children. This is likely due to several reasons. The primary food shopper was selected for inclusion in the main study, likely resulting in a sample of mostly female, older respondents (Dubowitz et al., 2015). Another limitation is that this study sampled adults and street segments in two low-income neighborhoods in the same city. Other studies of the built environment and health in disadvantaged individuals in the U.S. have included more diverse samples from several cities (Casagrande et al., 2009; Lovasi et al., 2009). Finally, although the audit tool was both detailed and comprehensive, some social environment exposures were not included, such as crime and perceived safety, which have been shown to negatively influence physical activity (Casagrande et al., 2009; Lovasi et al., 2009; Nehme et al., 2016).",
