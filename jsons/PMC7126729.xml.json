            "text": "In this issue of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, Sampathkumar et al23 provide a succinct review of SARS and a valuable primer for clinicians and infection control practitioners. Although clinical features of SARS are nonspecific, with near-ubiquitous fever and cough, it must be emphasized that coryza and sore throat, which are common with most other human respiratory virus infections, are uncommon in SARS, and the cough is characteristically nonproductive.9, 10, 11, 12 In contrast, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea are common and in some cases may predominate without respiratory symptoms.11, 19 Notably, several laboratory findings, rarely seen with other types of community-acquired pneumonia, may prove to be of considerable value as surrogate markers of early SARS: lymphopenia (<1000/\u03bcL); mild thrombocytopenia (<150,000/\u03bcL); evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with elevated D-dimer levels; low-grade rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine phosphokinase levels; and especially an elevated lactic dehydrogenase level; 1 or more of these abnormalities are seen in up to 90% of patients, particularly in sicker patients.9, 10, 11, 12 Until a sensitive, specific, and rapid confirmatory diagnostic test becomes available, for any febrile patient with cough, especially with radiological evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), who has recently returned from a country where community transmission of SARS is occurring or has occurred or who has had recent close contact with another person suspected of having SARS, an immediate algorithmic approach must be initiated to prevent nosocomial spread. Specific measures include segregating patients with suspected SARS from other patients, ideally in a negative-pressure isolation room; masking the patient; and requiring all health care workers attending to the patient to wear a fit-tested N-95 respirator mask (or powered air-purifying system), a full-length long-sleeved gown and nonsterile gloves, and eye protection with goggles or a face shield.24, 25 Suspicion of SARS must be recorded on all specimens sent to the diagnostic laboratory. As Sampathkumar et al point out, all health care workers attending to the patient must be noted and monitored closely for fever, the earliest sign of occupationally acquired infection.",

The exuberant, proliferative inflammatory response with alveolar membrane formation seen histopatho-logically5, 10, 11 is extremely similar to that seen in gardenvariety ARDS but also not unlike desquamative interstitial pneumonitis or organizing pneumonia,30 with or without bronchiolitis obliterans,31 conditions that usually respond favorably to corticosteroids. Evidence that moderate doses of corticosteroids may be of benefit in refractory late-phase severe ARDS32 and unequivocally improve survival in patients with AIDS and severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia33 further suggests that, in patients with SARS and progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, early treatment with prednisone at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg per day may improve survival. In contrast, the efficacy of antivirals such as ribavirin, which has substantial toxicity,12 is far less clear, and no antiviral drug or drugs can be recommended at this time.

Might it even explode on the world in the coming fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere (Table 1\n)? The huge negative economic impact of SARS in Asia and Canada to date has been sobering,38 but the very real potential for uncontained global spread is even more sobering. Accelerated efforts to develop a vaccine, with trials in animal models under way, are encouraging. We can take heart that SARS has been successfully contained in most affected countries,8, 16 at least for now, but most importantly, SARS may have launched a new era of international cooperation in communicable disease control and public health in general.14, 15 It is no longer acceptable for countries to conceal their outbreaks or other health care problems.39 Realizing that each day hundreds of thousands of people from every corner of the globe fly transcontinentally, the world is a rapidly shrinking global village in regard to infectious diseases. It is in every country's selfinterest to be forthcoming and work collaboratively toward a common goal-the prevention of communicable diseases and improvement of the health of every citizen of the world.",
