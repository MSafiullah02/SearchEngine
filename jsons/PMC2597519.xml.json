First, each peptide contains 3\u20135 copies of an artificially designed HR motif, which is totally different from the current anti-HIV peptides T20 and C34 that share a natural gp41 CHR sequence consisting of three different HR motifs (i.e., YTSLIHS-LIEESQN-QQEKNEQ) [7], [16]. Second, the residues at the a and d positions in the helical wheel are hydrophobic amino acids, e.g., Leu (L) or Ile (I), which can form a hydrophobic face for interaction with the residues at the e and g positions in the helical wheels of the N-helices. Third, the residues at the b and c positions in the helical wheel are negatively charged residues, e.g., Glu (E) and those at the f and g positions are positively charged residues, such as Lys (K). These amino acid residues can form a hydrophilic face to interact with water for increasing peptide solubility (Fig. 1B and C). Furthermore, the acid residues at the b and c positions in the helical wheel can interact with those at the f and g positions (i and i\n + 4), respectively, to form salt-bridges, in order to increase the helical structure stability of the peptides [17] (Fig. 1D). Five, the functional domains, PBD and LBD, are added, respectively, to the N- and C-termini of the HR sequence, mimicking the CHR-peptides C34 and T20, respectively [9], [18].",

While modeling the helix bundles formed by the designed HR-peptides with N36 by the PyMOL program, we found that all the designed HR-peptides had a tendency to interact with the NHR-peptide to form 6-HB. As shown in Fig. 2\n, four amino acid residues located at the d positions (magenta) in 5HRa (L3, L10, L17, and L24) may interact with the four amino acid residues at the g positions (yellow) in N36 (G572, L565, A558, and Q551), respectively. However, the binding and the complementarities between the residues of 5HRa and N36 are weaker than those of the residues between C34 and N36. When the LBD was introduced to 4HRa, it appeared from Fig. 2C that most of the critical interactions remained the same. However, addition of this hydrophobic part may have added hydrophobic interactions which are not evident from the currently available N36/C34 structure. On the contrary, the introduction of PBD in 4HRa made the most critical hydrophobic domain of C34 available to bind to the pocket region, probably in a similar fashion as C34. Addition of both PBD and LBD to the HR sequence (e.g., PBD\u20133HRa\u2013LBD) may have more dramatic effect on the overall interactions of these of peptides with the N-trimer.",

However, addition of LBD or PBD to the C- or N-terminus, respectively, of the 4HR sequence resulted in significant increase of the fusion inhibitory activity. For example, the inhibitory activity of 4HRa\u2013LBD or PBD\u20134HRa on the HIV-1-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion was about 1- and 2-fold higher than that of 5HRa. Addition of both PBD and LBD to the N- and C-termini, respectively, of the 3HR sequence led to further improvement of the membrane fusion inhibitory activity, e.g., PBD\u20133HRa\u2013LBD was about 11-fold more potent than 5HRa (Table 2\n).",

            "text": "Discovery of anti-HIV-1 peptides has created new avenues for developing viral fusion inhibitors against other viruses with class I membrane fusion proteins. This results from the fact that all these proteins contain the unique NHR (or HR1) and CHR (or HR2) sequences and use similar mechanisms to mediate viral fusion and entry [19]. It has been reported that peptides derived from the CHR regions of class I membrane fusion proteins are also effective against corresponding viruses, such as simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) [20], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [21], Ebola virus [22], Nipah and Hendra viruses [23], and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [24]. We thus questioned whether novel antiviral peptides could be designed by using a universal HR sequence consisting of multiple artificially designed leucine-zipper motifs as a template. To test this hypothesis, we first designed and synthesized three peptides, each of which contains five copies of a unique HR motif (5HRa, 5HRb, and 5HRc), and then assessed their potential anti-HIV-1 activity. Strikingly, all these peptides exhibited inhibitory activity on HIV-1-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and on HIV-1 replication, although the potency was moderate (Table 1, Table 2). Our previous studies have shown that both anti-HIV CHR-peptides, T20 and C34, contain a common 4-3 HR sequence. However, the peptide containing only this HR sequence (e.g., CHR-3) had weak anti-HIV-1 activity while addition of PBD or LPD to the N- or C-terminus of this HR sequence (e.g., C34 and T20, respectively) resulted in significant increase of HIV fusion inhibitory activity [9], [18]. Therefore, we postulated that addition of PBD and/or LBD to the peptides containing multiple copies of an HR motif (e.g., HRa) might also improve their anti-HIV-1 activity. Following this logic, we designed and synthesized three sets of peptides by adding PBD or LBD to the N- or C-terminus of the HR sequence and tested their anti-HIV-1 activity. Indeed, all these peptides containing an artificial HR sequence plus one functional domain (e.g., PBD\u20134HRa or 4HRa\u2013LBD) displayed improved inhibitory activity on HIV-1-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, addition of both PBD and LBD to the N- and C-termini of an HR sequence (e.g., PBD\u20133HRa\u2013LBD) resulted in further improvement of the anti-HIV-1 activity. Although the functional domain is critical for anti-HIV-1 activity, the HR sequence in the structural domain is also an important determinant for the antiviral activity of the designed HR-peptides. For example, all the HR-peptides containing HRa motif are more potent than those containing HRb or HRc motif in inhibiting HIV-1 replication (Table 3).",
