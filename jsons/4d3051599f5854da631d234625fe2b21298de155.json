            "text": "Much of the reconstruction of retroviral lineages has centred on the wellconserved reverse transcriptase (RT) motif of the polymerase gene ( pol) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Its high level of sequence conservation facilitates the design of primers that cast a wide net, amplifying RT sequences from a wide range of vertebrates [6] [7] [8] [9] . Additionally, conserved motifs allow easy alignment of even distantly related proteins, demonstrating, for example, the common ancestry of retroviruses and the many RT-containing elements found among various kingdoms of life [10] . Early RT-based analyses revealed the surprising fact that proviruses representing retroviruses estimated to have infected their hosts tens of millions of years ago or more harbour recognizable features of extant retroviruses, despite their notoriously high substitution rate [11] [12] [13] . While this situation leads evolutionists to ponder the 'molecular clock' conundrum [14] , the fidelity of features over deep evolutionary time also gives us a set of data that can be analysed using phylogenetic methods, revealing evolutionary dynamics of retrovirus-host interactions.",

Phylogenetic trees combining RT sequences from both endogenous and exogenous retroviruses suggest that all known retroviruses can be grouped into three broad classes [4, 15] : class I consists of gammaretroviruses, epsilonretroviruses and the ERVs that cluster along with them. Class II comprises the beta-and alpharetroviruses, and the lentiviruses, along with related ERVs. While no endogenous deltaretrovirus-like element has yet been discovered, an argument to include deltaretroviruses under the class II umbrella can be made based upon the catalytic site (YMDD) in RT, which matches that of the other class II members. Class III ERVs cluster with spumaretroviruses [16] -an ancient group of retroviruses that have largely co-speciated with their hosts [17] .",

Additionally, just as organismal chromosomes can have complex independent histories, recombination uncouples the evolutionary history of different parts of the retroviral genome [18] ; consequently, RT sequences reflect only one portion of the historical lineage giving rise to any given retrovirus genome. In this review, we explore some interesting details that analysis of endogenous retroviral env genes can provide, beyond those provided by the pol gene. When we allow env to tell its own story, new insights into retroviral evolution emerge, involving evidence and likelihood of cross-species transmissions, the evolution of new lineages and possibly genera, and even recombination between virus families that could generate new types of viruses.",

For these reasons, they will be omitted from this review.) Retroviral Env is synthesized as a polyprotein precursor that trimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and is cleaved by a host protease in the late Golgi apparatus. The result is a trimer of heterodimers, each consisting of two subunits-SU, for surface domain, and TM, for transmembrane domain-that either remain associated noncovalently, as in the case of betaretroviruses and lentiviruses, or by virtue of a single intersubunit disulfide bond, as found in gamma-, delta-and alpharetroviruses, and the subset of betaretroviruses formerly known as type D [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The Env trimers, anchored into the cellular membrane via the TM subunit, then traffic to the plasma membrane and stud the surface of the newly budding virus particles [27] . SU has maximum exposure to the host immune system, and includes the receptor binding domain (RBD); thus, it is under heavy adaptive pressure [28] and is poorly suited for phylogenetic analyses. TM, by contrast, is mostly shielded from the immune system by SU, and carries out the highly conserved, essential function of fusing the viral and host cell membranes during viral entry. Given the importance of this function, it is not surprising that the TM encoding portion of env is sufficiently conserved to be useful in phylogenetic analyses [16] .",

The cleavage site between SU and TM consists of a polybasic motif (K/R-X-K/R-R) [29] and marks the beginning of the TM portion of the sequence. The TM sequence has two hydrophobic stretches that flank an ectodomain (the portion of TM exposed on the outside of the virion). The first hydrophobic stretch, at or near the N-terminus, constitutes the fusion peptide (fp), and the second is the transmembrane region (tm), by which TM is anchored into the viral membrane. Prominent features of the ectodomain include two heptad repeat regions (hr1 and hr2) flanking a stretch of residues that contains either two or three cysteines. The heptad repeats play a critical role in the dynamic rearrangement of the trimer during the process of fusion, and formation of the highly conserved coiled-coil structure that is found among many viral fusion proteins [30] . The ectodomain sequence of some retroviruses also includes a region known as the immunosuppressive domain (ISD)-a stretch of 20 amino acids immediately upstream of the first cysteine residue, recognizable by its conserved residues [16] . Finally, C-terminal to the transmembrane region is the cytoplasmic tail (CT), which is located on the cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane and after assembly, on the interior side of the viral membrane. The CT can be highly variable both in length and sequence, even among retroviruses of the same genus.",

Upon binding to the receptor, a conformational change in SU exposes the fusion peptide of TM, which then inserts into the plasma membrane, either at the cell surface or within an endocytic compartment. TM subunits then fold into a highly stable structure consisting of a trimer of 'hairpins', in which the alpha-helical coiled-coils of hr1 and hr2 pack against one another. The energy released as TM trimers move from the metastable to the stable state drives the fusion of the cellular and viral membranes [32] . In addition to mediating fusion, TM also contributes to infection by other means. The ISD has been shown to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation [33] and allow escape from immune effectors of the innate and adaptive arms of the host immune system in a mouse model [34 -37] . Some functions that have been associated with the CT include modulation of fusogenicity [38] , interaction with cell signalling pathways [39, 40] , and possibly incorporation of Env in virus particles [41] . The membrane proximal external region (MPER) is a stretch of 30 residues immediately upstream of the transmembrane region that, in HIV-1, is thought to be important for Env incorporation into virions, as well as membrane disruption during fusion [42] [43] [44] . The cysteine pair in the ectodomain is highly conserved across the orthoretroviral TM (except in epsilonviruses). The cysteines are covalently bonded via a disulfide link, forming a loop within the TM ectodomain that is involved in interaction with SU. Studies have shown that elimination of the loop abrogates fusion [45] .",

In both the gamma-type and the avian gamma-type TM, the three cysteines are found in a rigidly conserved CX 6 CC motif, immediately downstream of the ISD sequence [16] . The avian gamma-type differs from the gamma-type in that an internal fusion peptide is located approximately nine amino acids downstream of the cleavage site rather than at the N-terminus.

How is the beta-type, with its two-cysteine motif, related to the gamma-type, with its three-cysteine motif? Did one arise from the other, losing or gaining a cysteine, for example? The shared domain organization and common features allow us to construct reasonable alignments of gamma-and beta-types. However, it is important to note that, at the sequence level, these two types are so highly diverged that basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [51] searches with the gamma-type TM sequence do not return any beta-type TM sequences and vice versa, despite the use of various parameters and datasets. Such divergence applies even when the ISD region is removed from the analysis [16] , or when cysteines in the ectodomain have been mutated [26] . In fact, the genetic distance between the gamma-type and beta-type TM is great enough that it allows for the possibility that they were acquired from independent sources, and that their shared features are due to convergent evolution rather due to than common ancestry. This situation has implications for phylogenetic analyses, as alignments of non-homologous sequences will not reveal valid evolutionary relationships.",

These viruses appear to be descendants of a virus that infected the primate lineage before the divergence of Old World and New World primates, roughly 50 Ma [61] . The viral progenitor was the product of a recombination event involving class I and class II viruses, by which a betaretrovirus (class II) acquired a gammaretroviral env (class I) from an unknown source, then diverged, giving rise to the lineage that includes LNGV and MPMV along the Old World lineage, and SMRV along the New World lineage [61] . Later, a type-D env (thus, a gamma-type env, even though its donor would be classified as a betaretrovirus) was acquired by a gammaretrovirus known as Papio cynocephalus ERV (PcEV), producing baboon endogenous retrovirus (BaEV) [60] . Thus, a gammatype env passed from a class I to a class II retrovirus, then back to class I again. The chain also extends further in the other direction: the env of BaEV recombined with gag-pol of Felis catus endogenous virus (FcEV) to produce RD114-an infectious ERV of cats [62].",

A collection of lentiviruses, for example, including the known endogenous forms, represents just one vertebrate class and one retroviral genus, yet has an average pairwise identity of just 21% among TM sequences. Similarly, among beta-type TM sequences, we see that a collection of six endogenous and exogenous TM sequences that represent only one class (mammals) and one genus (betaretroviruses) has an average pairwise identity of 26%. In stark contrast, within the gammaretroviral genus, a group of 10 TM sequences representing both exogenous and endogenous members from two vertebrate classes has an average pairwise identity of 51%-nearly twice that of the betaretrovirus genus. Adding TM sequences from four type-D betaretroviruses gives an average of 50%, in keeping with their having acquired a gammaretroviral env.

Among alpharetroviruses and the murine gammaretroviruses, a pattern is seen in SU amino acid sequences wherein a few discrete variable regions are flanked by regions of relatively high conservation [71, 72] . In many cases, such as with ALV-A and -B variants, the two variants have only a few amino acid changes in the variable region, yet bind cognate receptors that are quite different from one another in sequence and structure [73] . This situation suggests a strategy in which mutational space can be explored via a small variable region within the context of a well-conserved structure. Similarly, within the variants of MLV (i.e. ecotropic, amphotropic, xenotropic), SU has discrete variable regions near the N-terminus, where the RBD is found, with a rather highly conserved (64% identity at the amino acid level) C-terminal portion consisting of a proline-rich region (PRR) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) [74] .

How does the divergence profile of the gamma-type relate to its success across multiple vertebrate classes? And what prevents the beta-type from branching out of the mammalian class, despite enjoying wide-ranging success within its limits? Do the differing mechanisms of subunit association impact each type's ability to adapt? In the gamma-type env, the subunits are joined via a single covalent bond involving a specific motif in TM-the CX 6 CC region-to a cysteine in the CTD of SU. One could speculate that this configuration is key in allowing the remainder of SU to evolve a highly effective modular organization, whereby a variable RBD is positioned at the N-terminus, followed by a PRR that may serve as a flexible arm [73] . Under this model, the structure would afford the RBD a freedom of movement that increases its efficiency in exploring interactions with novel receptors. By contrast, in the beta-type env of HIV-1, weak interactions between SU and TM occur over multiple residues at both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of SU [23]a configuration that may limit the flexibility with which the beta-type env can explore mutational space.",

Are there structural features or other obstacles to fitness that prevent gammaretroviruses from acquiring beta-type env?

And given the evidence for several betaretroviruses having acquired a gamma-type env, is it possible that a lentivirus could do the same? What would be the implications for host range and pathogenicity of such a recombinant? The advantages afforded by acquisition of a gamma-type env need not be limited to the ability to bind novel receptors, but could extend to other functions of Env, such as the immunosuppression mediated by the ISD, which could confer more robust infectivity, or changes in infection kinetics or pathogenicity that favour endogenization. Although the ISD of some murine and primate retroviruses has been shown to modulate immunity in vivo [34 -36] , it is unknown to what extent it retains this function in other vertebrate classes, suggesting another interesting line of inquiry.",

In the process of adapting to the new host, the virus will diverge from its recombinant progenitor, probably all the more so in cases involving cross-species jumps between vertebrate classes. Although such events appear to be rare [75] , they can have significant impact-generating new viral lineages, and even new genera. In this context, the differences between gamma-type and beta-type env described here suggest that the broad division between class I and class II ERVs based on RT sequences represents divergence that was driven by association with two very different env typesclass I with the gamma-type env, and class II with the beta-type env. These two env types developed different dynamics as they followed different paths, with the gammatype acquiring modularity that may have contributed to its wide host range, and the beta-type limited to mammals. The propensity for recombination shown by the gamma-type, in conjunction with its wider host range, may have begun driving recombination towards replacement of the beta-type env with gamma-type env, with these events seeding new genera among class II viruses-the deltaretroviruses, the alpharetroviruses and the type-D betaretroviruses.",
