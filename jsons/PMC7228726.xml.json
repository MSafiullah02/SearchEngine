            "text": "RAN Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2) is a nuclear pore protein expressed in all tissues, with a wide range of intracellular functions. A missense mutation in the gene encoding RANBP2 (most commonly c.1880C>T: p.Thr585met) is associated with familial acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE1) (Neilson et al., 2009). Despite finding this clear relationship, the mechanism by which a mutation in RANBP2 predisposes a patient to ANE1 remains elusive. This may be due to several features of this protein and the resultant disease, including the many intracellular functions of RANBP2 and the rarity of ANE1. Here, the authors present a narrative review of the clinical phenotype previously described cases of RANBP2 associated ANE1 and its implications on therapeutic response and prognosis.",

            "text": "Though the condition is rare, the clinical and radiographic presentation of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is highly conserved. From a phenotypic standpoint, most reported cases of ANE progress through three stages: prodromal, acute, and recovery. The prodromal stage is often characterized by a febrile viral illness, classically with upper respiratory infectious symptoms, but can be gastrointestinal or otitis media (Mizuguchi et al., 1995, Neilson et al., 2003). Preceding infection is noted in most but not all cases. The acute phase of the illness consists of acute encephalopathy presenting 1-3 days following the onset of the prodromal stage, without resolution of the inciting infection. This phase includes deteriorating consciousness, with rapid progression to coma, and can be accompanied by seizures and focal neurologic deficits (Mizuguchi et al., 1995, Neilson et al., 2003, Singh et al., 2015). A summary of the clinical spectrum of the disorder from pooled studies is presented in Table 1\n. The latter two findings are often dependent on the location and burden of lesions. These neurologic symptoms can be associated with systemic symptoms as well (Akiyoshi et al., 2006, Mizuguchi et al., 2007). Across two studies with a total of 18 children with ANE approximately 62% were found to have elevated transaminases and 12% with findings suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Lee et al., 2019, Seo et al., 2010). In patients with liver dysfunction, transaminitis is seen in the absence of hyperammonemia (Lee et al., 2019, Seo et al., 2010).",

Compared to ANE, ANE1 involves a positive family history and/or personal history, as recurrent episodes are common in this disease (Neilson et al., 2003). In fact, half of patients with ANE1 will have at least one additional episode (Neilson et al., 2014). Positive family history can include affected relatives beyond first-degree relatives. Often, prior episodes of encephalopathy with preceding illness in the patient or family members may not have been diagnosed as ANE. Specifically, other personal or familial episodes may be labeled as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), cerebellitis, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, aseptic meningitis, viral encephalitis, or \u2018non-classic\u2019 Leigh syndrome (Neilson, 2010). Interestingly, patients with ANE1 have not been reported to have transaminitis or DIC as is commonly observed in patients with ANE (Neilson et al., 2009). There have been no studies assessing the association of ANE1 episodes with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies although this could potentially be a close mimic as well, especially in young children (Baumann et al., 2015).",

Poor prognostic factors include age of presentation <1-year-old, symptoms of delirium associated with brainstem lesions, hemorrhage and tissue loss on MRI, and degree of elevation of aminotransferases and CSF protein (Wu et al., 2015, Skelton et al., 2008, San Millan et al., 2007, Ormitti et al., 2010, Aydin et al., 2010, Okumura et al., 2009). Better outcome is associated with unilateral thalamic lesions and reversal of lesions on imaging (Wu et al., 2015, Yoshikawa et al., 1999). Importantly, early treatment of ANE with high dose steroids is associated with improved outcomes, specifically in patients without brainstem lesions, but often the diagnosis is missed, resulting in delayed treatment (Okumura et al., 2009). However, in ANE1, brainstem lesions are less prognostic (Neilson, 2010). Notably, other treatments including IVIG, plasmapheresis, or antivirals have not shown efficacy, although these are limited to case series level data (Okumura et al., 2009, Bloch et al., 2015).",

            "text": "While the clinical presentation and neuroimaging features are predominantly consistent, other elements can be variable. A mutation in RANBP2 engenders a predisposition to ANE1, but becoming symptomatic requires an environmental trigger, which is often a febrile viral infection. Several viruses have been implicated in ANE1 including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, varicella, HHV6, HHV7, enterovirus, rotavirus, HSV, rubella, coxsackievirus A9, measles, with influenza A being most common (Neilson et al., 2009, Soriano-Ramos et al., 2018, Skelton et al., 2008, Tran et al., 2001, Sugaya, 2002, Sazgar et al., 2003, Oki et al., 1995, Ohsaka et al., 2006, Mastroyianni et al., 2003, Martin and Reade, 2010, Mariotti et al., 2010, Lyon et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2004). Recently, SARS-CoV2 (also referred to as COVID-19) has been associated with the onset of ANE, adding to the existing literature of viral trigger phenomenon observed in the disease (Poyiadji et al., 2020). While most cases are associated with preceding viral infection, some cases have also been reported secondary to mycoplasma pneumonia and the diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (San Millan et al., 2007, Narita, 2002, Ashtekar et al., 2003). Interestingly, while the course and outcome of ANE1 vary, this variability does not depend on the inciting agent, indicating that a genetic predisposition to immune dysregulation is more likely the etiology than a specific antigenic trigger (Neilson, 2010).",

            "text": "Unsurprisingly, in most cases of ANE1 evidence of infection and inflammatory cell infiltration are not found in the CSF, suggesting the symptoms in ANE1 are not a direct effect of the infectious process itself. However, cytokines such as TNF alpha and IL6 are found to be elevated in the serum and/or CSF of patients with ANE1 (Ichiyama et al., 2003, Hosoya et al., 2005, Aiba et al., 2001). One prominent hypothesis of the etiology of ANE1 is that this encephalopathy is secondary to cytokine storm due to abnormal nuclear signaling, one of the important functions of RANBP2, with cytokines gaining access to the central nervous system as a result of disruption of the blood brain barrier (Mizuguchi et al., 2007). Consistent with this theory, in a motor neuron disease model with loss of RANBP2 in motor neurons, loss of this protein disrupts movement of nuclear transport receptors by the Ran GTPase, impacting proteostasis and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, ultimately resulting in substrate accumulation and delocalization (Cho et al., 2017). RANBP2 is also found to regulate chemokine signaling by controlling the generation and regulation of components of the signaling pathway including, Stat3, Cxcr4 and its ligands Cxcl14/Cxcl12, as well as Metalloproteinase 28 (Cho et al., 2017). These are implicated in pro-inflammatory signaling, however there was no evidence of macroglia or microglia activation associated with this finding (Cho et al., 2017). Notably in ANE1, elevated CSF cytokines are not accompanied by elevations in inflammatory cells and, on autopsy the parenchymal changes appreciated are out of proportion to observed inflammation (Wu et al., 2015). Also important to note is that the same inflammatory cytokines are elevated in influenza-associated encephalopathy, resulting in a different phenotype, suggesting that this cannot be the only mechanism behind the pathogenesis of ANE1 (Neilson, 2010).",

ANE1 clinically and histopathologically resemble other disorders of energy metabolism or defects in mitochondrial energy production such as Wernicke encephalopathy and Leigh encephalopathy, respectively (Neilson, 2010). Additionally, symmetric brain lesions are consistent with metabolic or mitochondrial disease which cause evenly distributed insults due to an energy failure state (Neilson, 2010). While many of the functions of RANBP2 are a result of its role in the Ran GTPase cycle, one if its Ran-GTP-independent mechanisms in the cell is to regulate the distribution of mitochondria by kinesin-1 activation (Patil et al., 2013). Additionally, loss of RANBP2 is associated with a shift toward fatty acid energy metabolism with concomitant decrease in both free fatty acids and phodphatidylcholine (Cho et al., 2017). Proposed mechanisms of the impact of RANBP2 deficits on stress-induced neurotoxicity include downregulation of hexokinase I activity and uncoupling of state IV of oxidative phosphorylation (Neilson et al., 2009, Neilson et al., 2003, Cho et al., 2012, Aslanukov et al., 2006). Errors in the metabolic functions of RANBP2 could potentially increase vulnerability to oxidative damage in the setting of infection, which itself may be associated with additive factors of fasting and catabolic stress (Cho et al., 2012).",

These include differences in the environmental trigger associated with the episode, such as route of exposure and load of viral inoculum (Neilson et al., 2009). It has been speculated that RANBP2 gene mutation resulting in amino acid substitutions may cause the final protein to have increased temperature sensitivity, causing protein misfolding that may alter function (Neilson et al., 2009). Thus, severity and duration of fever, could potentially contribute to reduced penetrance although this has not been directly studied. One patient, who was not tested for RANBP2 gene mutation, was found to have a thermolabile phenotype of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II variants, resulting in vulnerability to temperature sensitive encephalopathy (Kumakura et al., 2011). Although difficult to extrapolate to patients with genetically confirmed ANE1, individual variability of fever between patients could play a role in the incomplete penetrance seen in this disease but more study is needed. Additionally, individual differences in immune system components may contribute to this feature (Neilson et al., 2009).",

Oseltamivir, at high doses and in combination with steroids, has been reported to have efficacy and tolerability (Alsolami and Shiley, 2017) although the mechanism of action of oseltamivir is not thought to impact the presumably pathologic cytokine cascade and immune dysregulation observed in ANE1. Similarly, the use of immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis would not address the presumed pathologic disturbances reported in ANE1, underscoring why these therapies have not been found to have therapeutic impact in such cases. Based on the pathophysiology of the disease, there may be a role for targeted therapies such as IL6 or TNF alpha inhibition, but studies on these targeted biologics are limited, with only one pediatric case series being reported to have benefit from the use of tocilizumab when administered with corticosteroids (Koh et al., 2019). In this study, it was proposed that the primary benefit of IL6 inhibition may come from both limiting downstream cytokine activation and prevention of secondary excitotoxic brain injury.",

The diagnosis of ANE1 is often overlooked because it lacks specific clinical characteristics and is very rare, with diagnosis often made in the setting of genetic test results revealing the common RANBP2 missense mutation. Increased awareness of ANE1 is critical and a low threshold for imaging in patients with acute encephalopathy following a viral syndrome to reveal the characteristic symmetric lesions in the bilateral thalami would be beneficial for appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment. In patients meeting clinical or radiographic criteria for ANE, testing for RABNP2 mutation should be strongly considered.",
