            "text": "\nRecent disasters have clearly demonstrated the need for increased surge capacity on the part of all elements of out-of-hospital, hospital, and emergency department (ED) systems.1 Although billions of dollars have been spent to improve local, regional, and national preparedness, the preparedness efforts have focused on systems issues, such as statewide planning and coordination, interagency communications, and scene management, triage, and transport. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak raised the specter of entire hospitals becoming disabled because of quarantine and therefore unavailable to respond to the needs of the general public. SARS also introduced North American and other countries\u2019 governments and health care leaders to the modern concept of a massive population of acutely ill patients requiring high-level care during a short period, with the potential to overwhelm hospital ED and inpatient resources. More recently, concern about management options for possible human cases associated with H5N1 (avian) influenza is prompting a further reevaluation of our system capacities and infection control procedures.2 The threat of an epidemic outbreak of an acute infectious disease or of a large population exposure to a biological or chemical agent also challenges current systems in terms of \u201csurge capacity,\u201d the ability to rapidly increase capacity to provide effective, if limited, care to a significantly increased volume of acute care patients. The need to protect health care providers from possible infection, exposure, or contamination and to limit the potential for disease-causing agents to spread to other patients requires additional capacity. In addition, in case of mass casualty or epidemic in the community, effective containment systems in which suspected cases can be isolated are required even as patients are receiving lifesaving care. Currently, EDs in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere are challenged by large numbers of acutely ill patients and reduced numbers of inpatient beds, leading to ED crowding. Crowding is identified as a root cause of ambulance diversions, and even the relatively small increase in patient volume associated with the traditional influenza season increases the amount of time EDs are unable to accept patients.3\nEditor\u2019s Capsule Summary Summary\nWhat is already known on this topic\nMost hospitals cannot provide adequate isolation facilities for large numbers of patients.\nWhat question this study addressed\nMedical simulation scenarios were used to determine whether the use of negative pressure portable bioisolation tents impaired physicians\u2019 ability to perform emergency procedures quickly.\nWhat this study adds to our knowledge\nEmergency physicians did not require more time to perform procedures when they were done inside a portable bioisolation tent.\nHow this might change clinical practice\nLarge but portable negative pressure bioisolation tents can be incorporated into infectious disease disaster planning without concern that ability to perform procedures is significantly impaired.",

Although the likelihood of such an epidemic is unknown, recent analyses related to possible human-to-human spread of the H5N1 influenza virus suggest catastrophic effects on individuals and the health care system. The Government Accounting Office has found that many hospitals lack the capacity to respond to large-scale infectious disease outbreaks and lack adequate equipment and isolation facilities.4 EDs and hospitals generally have limited isolation capability, and much of this is concentrated in tertiary care facilities and major teaching hospitals. There exists no feasible contingency plan through which a large-scale escalation of ED and hospital isolation potential could be provided on short notice, and the construction of permanent, large-capacity isolation facilities is cost-prohibitive.",

Proponents of total negative pressure isolation systems argue that these portable structures are mobile and easily assembled and provide negative airflow and filter systems to prevent disease spread. Total negative pressure isolation is therefore proposed as a realistic alternative to hospital closure or quarantine at times of greatly increased need. Although there are some data assessing the technical performance of such systems,5, 6, 7 no study to date has evaluated the potential impediments of this environment to the performance of critical medical procedures.",

            "text": "Transmission of infection within a hospital requires 3 elements: a source of infecting microorganisms, a susceptible host, and a means of transmission for the microorganism.8 Transmission of disease can occur through direct contact (body surface to body surface), indirect contact (contact through intermediate object), airborne (small: 5 \u03bcm or smaller that can remain suspended for long periods) droplets (generated by coughing or sneezing of heavy particles that do not remain suspended), common vehicle (through contaminated items such as food and water), and vector-borne (mosquitos, flies, etc) mechanisms. Garner8 reviewed the types of isolation precautions taken in hospitals: handwashing and gloving, patient placement, transport of infected patients, meals, respiratory protection, eye protection, face shields, gowns and protective apparel, patient care equipment and articles, linen and laundry, dishes, glasses, cups, and eating utensils. Standard precautions are used for all patients: airborne precautions for those infected with organisms of 5 \u03bcm or smaller size, droplet precautions when larger particles are involved and pose little risk of airborne transmission, and contact precautions when skin-to-skin transmission can occur. Precautions appropriate for common organisms are found in Figure E1\n(available online at http://www.annemergmed.com), and a more complete listing is provided online by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.8 Of the interventions implemented to reduce transmission of infection, handwashing and glove use are believed to be the most important interventions to help reduce spread of infection in general hospital practice.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Airborne precautions require monitored negative air pressure, with 6 to 12 air changes per hour and safe discharge of air through filters to prevent contamination of the ambient environment.",

Because of the great expense associated with building new or retrofitting existing patient care areas to provide adequate negative pressure environments, interest has turned to relatively inexpensive portable systems. Portable systems have potential additional advantages to fixed infrastructure because they can be rapidly deployed, quickly assembled, and expanded as needed. Medical isolation is distinct from quarantine. In quarantine, no particular medical interventions are implicit, whereas medical isolation includes the ability to deliver health care during the isolation phase.",

An Isoark Collapsible/Portable Negative Pressure Isolation Chamber (Collective Protection Engineering, Inc., Baltimore, MD) (Figure) produced by Collective Protection Engineering, Inc., was placed in one of the 2 adjoining simulation rooms. The IsoArk has a 90-by-90-inch chamber with an anteroom airlock. In the bioisolation study room, noninvasive monitors, oxygen, and suction ports remained outside of the tent. Access to these devices was through cables and tubes that traversed ports situated within the tent\u2019s walls. The tent and the door to the regular room were placarded with standard airborne isolation precaution signs as used in the hospital.",

The initial study protocols also called for measurement of the time between the decision to perform a procedure and its subsequent completion. To emulate as much as possible the actual resuscitative environment, however, the groups were not given specific instruction about to how to convey decisions or information. As a result, it became clear to the observers early in the study that it was not possible to accurately determine a definitive point in time about group \u201cintent,\u201d and this data point frequently could not be recorded.
