This has led to a new interest in the analysis of viral populations, which, until recently, was usually linked to outbreaks and other health emergencies. Most previous studies paid attention only to those fragments of the viral genome that were of interest from a clinical perspective, for diagnostics, surveillance, or similar applications. Furthermore, most insights into the population genetics of viral populations were drawn from markers likely under the influence of selective forces, thus leading to distorted or biased views of viral population genetics. This situation is rapidly changing, and the availability of complete genome sequences is shifting the perspective from \u201cpopulation genetics\u201d to \u201cpopulation genomics,\u201d that is, the analysis of the processes and mechanisms that govern the population dynamics of genetic variation at the complete genome level and not only on a portion of it.",

This shift has also benefited from recent methodological and technical advances, which have allowed the combination of different sources of information (temporal, geographical, genetic, and epidemiological) into a comprehensive framework, known as \u201cgenomic surveillance.\u201d Here, we review the current state of the art in the population genomics of human viruses and its relevance for the surveillance, monitoring, and control of the diseases they cause. Because of their rapid rate of evolution and the serious diseases they produce \u2013 AIDS, hepatitis C, Ebola, influenza, among many others \u2013 RNA viruses have received most attention until now and abundant information on their population genomics is accumulating.

One defining feature of RNA viruses is their high mutation rates, in the range from 10\u22123 to 10\u22126 mutations/nucleotide/replication round, which result from low-fidelity replication (Simon-Loriere et al. 2013; Cuevas et al. 2015; Duffy et al. 2008; Sanjuan et al. 2010). This also leads to a very high evolutionary rate of 10\u22122 to 10\u22125 substitutions/site/year. These high mutation rates can be decomposed into several factors or mechanisms with complex interactions such as the fidelity of the RNA polymerase, the capacity for error correction, the propensity of ribonucleic acid to damage, or the edition by hosts\u2019 enzymes (Geller et al. 2016; Cuevas et al. 2015). These high mutation rates might explain the small genome size of RNA viruses (ranging from 3 to 29 kb) because in larger genomes, deleterious mutations would appear at such a high frequency that they would compromise virus survival (Duffy et al. 2008; Bradwell et al. 2013).",

These features favor fast evolutionary rates, which lead to genetically very diverse populations, with a high capacity for adaptation even under very strong selective pressures (Wilson et al. 2016). However, we must consider that virus evolutionary rates are limited by the frequency of deleterious mutations since virus mutation rates are very close to the error threshold beyond which deleterious mutations are so frequent that they lead to population extinction (Holmes 2003). In addition, some mechanisms for genetic exchange, which are present in some RNA viruses, favor the generation and maintenance of diversity. Two such mechanisms are genetic reassortment and recombination (homologous and nonhomologous).",

Reassortment plays a major role at the epidemiological level in the evolution of influenza A virus (Rambaut et al. 2008; Wilson et al. 2016; Steel and Lowen 2014) and in other segmented viruses (McDonald et al. 2016; Nomikou et al. 2015). Recombination is also a frequent process in many viruses. In retroviruses, such as HIV, a nonhomologous type of recombination known as copy-choice recombination is common, and it can occur when two different viral strains simultaneously infect the same cell. In this form of recombination, the RNA polymerase \u201cjumps\u201d between two copies of single-stranded RNA, which makes up the genome of retroviruses, while it is still attached to the newly synthesized chain. This mechanism occurs only during RNA synthesis and the parental (donor) strand is not physically transferred to the recombined strand. It is likely that secondary structures of the RNA genomes are involved in controlling the \u201cjump\u201d between strands (Lai 1992; Negroni and Buc 2000; Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011).",

Antigenic drift \u2013 antigenic evolution in influenza A virus \u2013 exemplifies this phenomenon and should not be confused with genetic drift. Due to the interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, mutations accumulate in antigenic regions encoding surface proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Influenza A viruses show episodic selection, that is, positive selection over long periods interspersed with purifying selection over short time periods. This process might explain the new seasonal antigenic variants of influenza A virus (Rambaut et al. 2008; Cobey and Koelle 2008; McHardy and Adams 2009).

The ratio of both rates (\u03c9 = dN/dS) allows different types of selection to be distinguished throughout the viral genome. Under neutral evolution, all mutations are expected to have the same effect (i.e., none or negligible) on fitness, and, thus, \u03c9 will be around 1. Negative or purifying selection reduces dN \u2013 because non-synonymous substitutions lead to changes in the amino acid sequence and thus protein structure or function will likely be affected \u2013 whereas dS should not be affected. Therefore, the ratio \u03c9 will be lower than 1. In contrast, positive selection favors non-synonymous substitutions over synonymous substitutions, and, therefore, \u03c9 will be larger than 1 (Cobey and Koelle 2008; Jackowiak et al. 2014).",

Firstly, the method was originally proposed to analyze selection acting over evolutionary large time scales, because it makes use of the rates of substitution, which implies the replacement and fixation of mutations in populations/species. This is not usually the case in viral populations, where we are dealing with constantly arising polymorphisms that, even when they are deleterious, will segregate in the population before selection removes them. This effect can be controlled for by considering only those mutations that can be mapped onto the internal branches of the phylogeny whereas those at the external branches are excluded from the analyses. Secondly, these tests can be misleading if recombination occurs frequently (Anisimova et al. 2003), because it may alter the estimates of dN and dS, thus leading to incorrect estimates of \u03c9.",

These are targets of neutralizing antibodies, CD4 T-cell and CD8 T-cell epitopes (i.e., regions of viral antigen recognized by molecules of the host immune system) (Zanini et al. 2015; Jackowiak et al. 2014). However, their relevance has been questioned. For example, CD4 T-cell epitopes seem to be conserved (i.e., under negative selection) in HCV, whereas CD8 T-cell epitopes are under positive selection and, consequently, drive immune evasion in this virus (Cuypers et al. 2016; Pati\u00f1o Galindo and Gonz\u00e1lez-Candelas 2017). Another example is represented by the mapping of positively selected sites in the HIV genome and by considering different likely targets of selection, such as epitopes recognized by immune system cells, secondary structure of protein and nucleic acids, and particular dinucleotides targeted by antiviral proteins such as APOBEC3G/F (Snoeck et al. 2011). Antibody and CD4 T-cell epitopes were found to be under positive selection. However, no positive selection was detected on CD8 T-cell epitopes. Although this observation may suggest an absence of host selective pressures acting on CD8 T-cell epitopes, the authors suggest other explanations. On the one hand, positively selected escape variants without deleterious effects will fix rapidly in the viral population, thus becoming relatively conserved. On the other hand, T-cell epitopes could be under opposite selective pressures over chronic infection.",

These features (including high mutation rates, large population sizes, and recombination or reassortment) facilitate the emergence of de novo resistance mutations. In the absence of drug-selective pressures, resistance mutations may be deleterious or, occasionally, neutral, which implies that their evolution will be governed mainly by genetic drift. For this reason, in the absence of treatment, drug-resistant variants are usually found as minority variants that increase their relative frequency in the population only in the presence of antiviral drugs. Hence, the possibility of transmission of resistance mutations between hosts must be taken into account in order to predict the effectiveness of a particular antiviral therapy. Next-generation sequencing is necessary to detect resistance variants at low frequencies prior to the start of treatment. The development of drug resistance may depend on the presence of various permissive mutations in the same haplotype in order to decrease the genetic barrier (Wilson et al. 2016; Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Chabria et al. 2014).",

The evolution of HIV since the introduction of early antiretroviral therapies is a good example of this process. Modern treatments \u2013 highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) \u2013 are more effective than single drug-based early therapies. HAART consists in a customized combination of drugs. Therefore, several resistance mutations are necessary to develop simultaneous resistance against every drug included in the treatment. In contrast, early, single drug-based therapies were prone to the rapid emergence of drug resistance (Smyth et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2008). Due to the high efficiency of treatments consisting of different drugs, resistance mutations are uncommon and emerge rarely. Thus, positive selection results in strong selective sweeps that reduce genetic diversity and slow down virus evolution (Feder et al. 2016). The opposite situation was found in influenza A virus resistance to oseltamivir. One of several resistance mutations to oseltamivir (H274Y) underwent rapid and global spread during the influenza seasons between 2007 and 2009. However, the rapid increase in H274Y frequency did not substantially alter the viral genomic diversity. It is perhaps a consequence of emergence of different mutations conferring resistance to oseltamivir (Renzette et al. 2014).",

However, gene overlapping leads to hypersensitivity to deleterious mutations (i.e., an increase in the deleterious effects of mutations in overlapping genome regions) as they affect more than one gene. Therefore, strong purifying selection operates in these regions, resulting in a reduced evolutionary rate and adaptation in RNA viruses. Despite this, the negative effects of gene overlapping on evolutionary rate depend on the type of overlapping where internal overlapping (i.e., a single gene that contains another gene within its nucleotide sequence) is associated with stronger negative selection (Simon-Loriere et al. 2013).",

Nucleotide pairings usually follow the classical Watson-Crick model (guanine-cytosine [G-C] and adenine-uracil [A-U]). As expected, any mutation disrupting Watson-Crick pairs will alter highly conserved RNA secondary structures. Thus, they are often deleterious, and we expect that strong purifying selection operates on Watson-Crick sites, resulting in a reduced rate of evolution. This pattern has been observed in HIV, HCV, and influenza A virus. However, G-U pairs are also stable and they can maintain RNA structures. Although G-U pairs usually show fewer effects on fitness than Watson-Crick pairs, the fitness difference is relatively small. G-U pairs can operate as intermediates between adaptive peaks (i.e., G-C and A-U pairs), thus relaxing negative selective pressures on Watson-Crick sites. Moreover, G-U can remain in the population because, after all, G-U pairs show higher fitness than unpaired nucleotides (Assis 2014).",

However, H274Y spread rapidly and globally, thanks to two permissive mutations that made the mutant fitness equal to that of the non-mutated genotype in the absence of oseltamivir (Neverov et al. 2015; Duan et al. 2014; Kryazhimskiy et al. 2011).",

Natural selection favors high mutation rates in viruses as they increase their adaptive capacity, particularly regarding infection, host adaptation, and immune escape. In this light, viral mutation rates might be considered a virulence factor. The presence of local RNA secondary structures in the viral genome may operate as a mechanism of modulation for genome variability. RNA secondary structures flank hypervariable regions, which are prone to low-fidelity replication because they are usually located in single-stranded segments, thus focusing higher mutation rates in genomic regions involved in immune escape (Geller et al. 2016; Cuevas et al. 2015; Duffy et al. 2008; Sanju\u00e1n and Border\u00eda 2011).",

This prominent feature has been analyzed in depth in some viruses that produce chronic or persistent infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, it is also possible to analyze the genetic changes at the intra- and inter-hosts levels in viruses that produce acute infections, such as influenza A virus. Viral evolution during chronic infection occurs simultaneously in different parts of the genome and, depending on the virus, independently in the segments. Hence, it is important to analyze genetic diversity in complete genomes, because different genome regions can be under distinct, even opposed, selective pressures (Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Holmes 2004; Luciani and Alizon 2009; Lythgoe and Fraser 2012; Sobel Leonard et al. 2016).",

It is unlikely that there is only one genome sequence in the founder population shared by all the viruses. However, among the many variants present in the source individual, the fittest phenotypes for transmission will be more represented in the infecting population. Shortly after the infection, the process known as clonal expansion starts. This process results from the rapid replication of the virus that leads to an increasingly diverse population in which new mutations accumulate from the initial sequence. This genetically diverse population is usually known as a viral quasispecies (Eigen 1996), a set of highly diverse, evolutionarily close, nonidentical haplotypes (because they derive from the same virus or a reduced population) undergoing diversification, competition, and selection (Chabria et al. 2014; Domingo et al. 2012; Khiabanian et al. 2014). In later stages of infection, the initially homogeneous viral population will be more diverse. This indicates that, during transmission, there are several bottlenecks that reduce diversity at the inter-host level (Gray et al. 2011; Joseph et al. 2015).",

This is supported by the fact that the same reversions are observed in unrelated individuals. In HIV, some nucleotide substitutions produced during intra-host evolution are reversions to that global consensus sequence (Zanini et al. 2015; Li et al. 2007). This trend suggests that in chronic infections, directional natural selection is the main evolutionary force determining the diversity of the viral population. But most mutations are neutral or reduce rather than increase fitness. Nevertheless, in populations with high recombination rates, such as in HIV, adaptation to the host may be concurrent with a sustained exploration of the adaptive landscape. This trend is more evident for globally conserved genome positions, and it can also be observed in viruses producing acute infections (Zanini et al. 2015; Sobel Leonard et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014; Gire et al. 2014). However, the number of positions under directional positive selection in the HIV genome is limited. Most of the genome is under purifying selection or accumulates neutral mutations. The action of diversifying selection, which acts in an opposite sense to directional selection, and the emergence of neutral mutations may disguise the convergence toward a global consensus sequence in positively selected positions (Snoeck et al. 2011; Ross and Rodrigo 2002).",

Intra-host evolutionary rates can be from two to six times higher than those among hosts (Lythgoe and Fraser 2012). Viral evolutionary rates show a trend to slow down in the long term.

If this were the case, we would not observe such different values between the corresponding rates (Alizon and Fraser 2013; Lythgoe and Fraser 2012). To explain this difference, we should also take into account that the viral population needs to adapt to the immune system of a specific host after each transmission. Therefore, intra-host evolution is governed by strong, continuous selective pressures leading to fast evolutionary dynamics with high evolutionary rates. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the viral population and the different lineages that can coinfect an individual may affect the action of the immune system and, in consequence, the viral evolutionary dynamics (Grenfell et al. 2004).",

Among potential alternatives, we can mention the following: (a) preferential transmission of slow-evolving lineages, (b) reduced intra-host rate of evolution over time, (c) reversion to genotypes similar to the founder virus that are likely better adapted to infecting other hosts, and (d) changes in selective pressures over the course of infection (Gray et al. 2011; Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Lythgoe and Fraser 2012). In HCV, it has been shown that the large differences between intra- and inter-host evolutionary rates in genome regions related to evasion from the immune system can be explained by reversions of host-specific adaptations to genotypes similar to those of the founder virus. The hypothesis of a preferential transmission of slow-evolving lineages seems to be quite unlikely, at least for HCV (Gray et al. 2011). In other viruses, such as HIV, the contribution of reversions to evolution has not been studied in detail (Zanini et al. 2015). Another contributing factor is that inter-host evolution is shaped by many bottlenecks produced in every transmission event (Gray et al. 2011; Joseph et al. 2015), which act reducing the evolutionary rate. As a consequence, phylogenies including isolates serially sampled within patients usually present long external but short internal branches, the latter corresponding to evolutionary changes occurring among patients.",

The viral population evolves at the intra-host level during infection, becoming adapted to each new host.

The rate of replication of the founder virus is an important factor for the epidemiological success of the disease as well as for the natural history of the viral population in the infected individual. The rate of replication influences the interaction between the viral population and the immune system of the host, which is a key factor determining the outcome of the infection (acute or chronic). The rate of replication is a quantitative trait that also evolves throughout an infection. There are observations of groups of variants in subpopulations, both within and among hosts, with different RNA polymerase activity. Hence, diverse variants with different ranges in their rates of replication can coexist in the same individual (Luciani and Alizon 2009). High rates of growth lead to a stronger immune response against the virus. Consequently, at the inter-host level, the prevalence of slow-replicating variants is favored by natural selection, because it allows a longer time of infection in the host and, as a result, maximizes the reproductive number (R\n0) of the infection. In epidemiology, R\n0 is defined as the number of new infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population and is very closely related to the intrinsic rate of growth of a population in ecological models. However, at the intra-host level, variants with a high rate of replication are favored, because they allow a faster exploitation of the host\u2019s resources.",

The viral diversity and its dynamics are crucial for the design of vaccines (Cuypers et al. 2016; Gaschen et al. 2002) and for determining whether an infection leads to a chronic or acute disease or the chances of success of the antiviral therapy (Gray et al. 2011; Chabria et al. 2014).",

Its higher sensitivity compared to traditional Sanger sequencing allows a deeper analysis of viral diversity, identifying minority variants and rare polymorphisms that, on the one hand, are invisible for classical techniques, which usually involve reconstructing consensus sequences, and, on the other hand, can be very relevant for basic and applied research (Chabria et al. 2014; Khiabanian et al. 2014).

Holmes (2004) used a wider definition in which phylogeography incorporates spatial and temporal patterns as well as their interactions. The rapid evolution of viruses can generate enough genetic variation, even at the intra-host level, in just a few days to perform phylogenetic analyses at the infected individual level. This allows applying phylogenetic methods to emerging diseases and to build highly resolved phylogenetic trees (Holmes 2004; Avise 2000; Pybus et al. 2015).

If samples are identified with known dates, then the branching events and the common ancestor in a phylogeny can be placed in a temporal scale. This information can be integrated with spatial information to reconstruct the dispersal history of a virus, linking each branch of the phylogeny with its geographic location. Therefore, with models based on the molecular clock, it is possible to analyze the spread of an epidemic (in months or years) complementing the phylogeny of the isolates with a time scale (Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Pybus et al. 2015). The simplest models for the molecular clock, also known as \u201cstrict clock\u201d models, assume a single, constant evolutionary rate for all the lineages.

However, the analysis at the genome level is very important to obtain a more complete and unbiased information. Mechanisms such as recombination and reassortment may generate genomes in which different portions thereof have different evolutionary histories (Rambaut et al. 2008; McHardy and Adams 2009; Holmes 2004; Pybus et al. 2015), and this has to be considered when analyzing complete genomes. Next-generation sequencing methods have advanced to the \u201csubnucleotide\u201d level in the analysis of viral sequences. This implies considering the infected individuals as viral populations rather than repetitive collections of the same consensus genome and, additionally, detecting variability within individuals, even very low-frequency variants (subclonal variants). Studying the intra-host and subclonal variability can improve the resolution of phylogenetic analyses and, when combined with epidemiological information, provide a very valuable information to track transmission chains during an outbreak, especially when the transmission rate is very fast, even higher than the viral evolutionary rate (Emmett et al. 2015).",

This is closely related to the density and communication between susceptible populations because for virus transmission, a certain proximity between hosts or hosts and vectors is necessary. The smaller the population size of the host, the less likely transmission will be and, consequently, the more difficult to be sustained long enough to cause acute infections. However, large, dense host populations can easily sustain a virus that causes short, virulent infections. In this context, the analysis of the basic reproductive number (R\n0) is highly relevant. This number depends on several factors, such as the number of contacts with susceptible individuals, the probability of transmission, and the length of the infectious period (Dietz 1993). This value is very useful to estimate the speed of propagation of an infection in a susceptible population (Ridenhour et al. 2014). The interest in estimating this parameter and its application to the analysis of outbreaks and epidemics and the design of public health strategies gained momentum during the influenza A pandemics of 2009 (Fraser et al. 2009; Ridenhour et al. 2014).",

This is the case for some viruses, such as Ebola virus, with reservoirs in animal species but also capable of being transmitted from person to person. Furthermore, even in RNA viruses well-adapted to humans, there is the possibility of relatively frequent zoonotic contacts, such as in influenza A and MERS-CoV, which are usually associated with the emergence of epidemics and pandemics as a result of genetic exchanges between strains from different species. For vector-borne viruses, we must consider not only human geography but also the geographic distribution of the corresponding vectors, such as different mosquitos of the genera Aedes and Culex, which are vectors for Zika, dengue, or chikungunya viruses. Spatial distribution analyses should also include ecological features, life history, or migration potential of the vectors (Holmes 2004; Faria et al. 2017; Shen et al. 2016; Bullivant and Martinou 2017; Cunha and Opal 2014).",

The global communications and interrelationships of human populations are growing continuously and represent new opportunities for the transmission, propagation, and colonization of new regions by viruses and their vectors. These can move viruses across geographic barriers and bring into contact with previously isolated populations. This process has contributed to the emergence and reemergence of viral epidemics such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. However, we are just starting to understand the effects of global mobility of people and goods on the genetic diversity and evolution of viruses (Alcala et al. 2016; Pybus et al. 2015). To better control epidemics and to understand the evolution and ecology of viruses, it will be necessary to integrate spatial and genomic information along with information about human mobility in a single mathematical framework (Pybus et al. 2015). One example in this direction is BEAST, a framework for Bayesian statistical analysis that allows inference of phylogeographic relationships including spatial and temporal dynamics of migration (Lemey et al. 2009; Drummond and Rambaut 2007).",

These dates were coincident with several events that brought an important flow of international air traffic to Brazil, such as the 2014 FIFA World Cup (June\u2013July 2014) and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup (June 2013) of football (Faria et al. 2016).

Hence, during this period, natural selection and demographic changes, such as expansions and bottlenecks, acting on either the viral or the host population will affect the evolution of the virus. After the viral populations are connected again, gene flow, recombination, or reassortment will influence the evolution of the virus, leading to a \u201cmixture\u201d at the genome level. Although selection and demographic changes still act during the reconnection, the other processes act more intensely and rapidly. This mixture impacts on diversity at the genome level: isolated populations have evolved independently, diverging and adapting to the specific conditions of their host populations. After reconnection, the diversity that has accumulated separately increases, which also leads to higher adaptive potential since recombination and reassortment allow the combination of polymorphisms selected in different environments into the same genome. If these polymorphisms are compatible in that particular genomic context, this opens the opportunity for the development of new features which might have not developed (or do so only after very long periods) by just mutation and selection. The second consequence of this shared genetic diversity is a progressive trend toward the homogenization of the populations. Due to the increase in human mobility, these events are expected to be more frequent in the future (Alcala et al. 2016).",

They are very sensitive to sampling bias and not robust to scarce genetic data.

Those variants that are favored by selection within hosts \u2013 mutations for evading the immune system and drug resistance \u2013 may diminish the capacity for transmission of the virus and, in consequence, will be selected against at the inter-host level. In addition, every transmission event represents a bottleneck that reduces drastically the population size of the virus and, consequently, also its genetic diversity. This leads to slower evolutionary rates at the inter-host level. For instance, in HIV there seems to be an inverse relationship between transmission and evolutionary rate (Berry et al. 2007). We must also consider how and by which means is the virus transmitted. Transmission rates are higher in air-transmitted virus, such as influenza A, than in those that use the sexual route. Similarly, those viruses that use arthropod species as vectors have lower rates of evolution, a cost associated to their need for replication in different hosts (Holmes 2004; Woelk and Holmes 2002).",

Standard techniques, based on deriving consensus sequences, miss the presence of minor or subclonal variants (low-frequency polymorphisms) which might be important to understand the dynamics of viral populations as well as the evolution and spread of the disease. Next-generation sequencing techniques allow the detection of rare polymorphisms and minor variants and lead to consideration of infected hosts as viral populations rather than \u201ccollections\u201d of the same consensus genome. Consequently, these methods provide a better view of viral diversity, which enables an improvement in the study of the epidemiology and evolution of human viruses. A more widespread use of these technologies to characterize genome variation will provide increased information about the intra-host dynamics and the relationship between viral diversity and infection outcome (Liu et al. 2012; Farci et al. 2000), the inter-host transmission and dynamics (reservoirs for better-transmitted variants), the development of resistance and the failure of antiviral treatments, and the building of highly resolved phylogenies and transmission histories during epidemic outbreaks. In addition, advances in sequencing technologies have also allowed the fast and in-depth analysis of complete genomes. The evolution and accumulation of genetic variation occur differently and simultaneously throughout the genome. Separate regions of the same genome can interact with each other (epistasis) and, even, evolve independently and show different phylogenetic histories. Hence, the possibility of analyzing complete genomes \u2013 as opposed to the analysis of individual loci or isolated genome regions \u2013 provides a more complete, resolved, and less biased view of genomic variation, the phylogeny and population dynamics of the virus.",

This is intimately related to the clinical and epidemiological relevance of the disease caused by most viruses. Human diseases with high prevalence and important consequences such as HIV, hepatitis C, or influenza receive much attention in the public health realm and have a more efficient surveillance. This translates in higher availability of viral genomes and epidemiological information, which are necessary for the evolutionary analysis of virus populations.",
