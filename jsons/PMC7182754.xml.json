This happened presumably, from the index case to another individual staying in the same hotel floor, and some secondary cases occurred after indirect exposure in hospital facilities in a confined space [32]. Other SARS outbreaks like the Amoy Garden outbreak in 2003 led to the hypothesis of, at least, an opportunistic airborne transmission [9], [13]. Bathrooms sewage systems were the probable contamination route for residents at Amoy Gardens. Researchers believed that the drainage of contaminated fluids from one bathroom floor could have led the virus into the sewage system. It was also suggested that the droplets could enter other bathrooms by the negative pressure generated when the door is closed. The authors didn\u2019t found support for other routes of transmission such as the airborne [33]. Also, during the 2003 SARS outbreak, an emergency room (ER) outbreak was studied. Researchers failed to trace a common source for several cases of SARS, especially amongst hospital care workers (HCWs). Samples were collected at multiple ER sites, including positive samples for the outlet of the central air supply. Air samples were collected at central air supply and all turned up negative. However, the operation of the ER was suspended three days earlier to the air samples collection [22].",

There are missing links in transmission and possible unknow indirect infection routes in many epidemiological studies.

The witnessed rapid spread of the virus points out to an even more effective transmission route and hence, airborne transmission must be considered plausible.
