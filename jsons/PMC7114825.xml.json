            "text": "\nHelicobacter pylori infection probably represents the most common bacterial infection of the human species with a prevalence of 25\u201350% in developed countries and up to 90% in developing countries.1, 2 A wide body of evidence now indicates that H. pylori is the major aetiological agent of chronic active gastritis,3 and gastric and duodenal ulcers,4 and represents a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer.5\nH. pylori is almost always acquired in childhood and, if untreated, infection is usually lifelong. The only consistent source of H. pylori is the gastric mucosa of human beings. An environmental source of infection has not been identified. Person-to-person spread therefore seems to be the most likely mode of transmission.2 Evidence that supports person-to-person transmission includes the clustering of H. pylori infection in families,6, 7, 8 in institutions for the mentally handicapped9, 10 and in submarine crews.11 As well as in the human stomach, viable H. pylori cells have been detected in faeces and oral secretions.12, 13 Therefore, possible routes of person-to-person transmission are gastric to oral, faecal to oral, or oral to oral.2, 14, 15 Healthcare workers who come into contact with patients and contaminated secretions could be at increased risk of infection by H. pylori. The majority of studies on the risk of infection for healthcare workers have focused on endoscopists and endoscopy room staff. These studies, mainly performed by serological diagnosis, have yielded conflicting results about the rate of H. pylori infection among professionals performing gastroendoscopic procedures. Some studies have not found a statistically significant difference in the infection rates compared with controls,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 while others have.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Consequently, a consensus has not been reached regarding the occupational risk for acquiring H. pylori infection. In these studies, different groups of subjects have been used as controls: blood donors;23 healthy non-medical professionals;21, 24, 25 and non-endoscopy medical personnel.18, 22\n",

We observed similar prevalence of infection in nurses working in an endoscopy unit or other clinical departments. Therefore, strict and continuous contact with patients seems to be a risk factor for H. pylori infection because the infected patients may release and spread the micro-organism from saliva, stool and vomitus. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that emesis can be a potent mechanism for discharging millions of H. pylori cells into the environment, and positive H. pylori cultures have also been obtained from air sampled during vomiting.13 Our results suggest that professional category exposure involving direct patient contact rather than educational attainment of healthcare workers can constitute a risk factor for H. pylori infection. In agreement, the rate of infection in laboratory personnel (contrarily to general medical staff) was low and was not influenced by educational level (technicians, 10.5%; graduates, 18.2%).",

Although the study design did not allow this aspect to be investigated specifically, it may be hypothesized that since the H. pylori identification by Warren and Marshall35 in 1984, endoscopy personnel have probably acquired safer working habits and thus younger workers may have had a lower risk of infection. Moreover, the high prevalence in older endoscopy staff suggests that the period in which the exposure during endoscopy occurred could have enhanced acquisitional risk. The high prevalence of infection in general nurses of the two age groups (<40 and \u226540 years) suggests that infection control measures adopted in non-endoscopy departments are probably not as efficacious towards H. pylori, a micro-organism that colonizes the stomach for years or decades causing asymptomatic infections in most cases.

The high infection rate observed in nurses suggests an increased risk of occupational exposure and calls for more strict precautionary guidelines to reduce the transmission of H. pylori to healthcare staff.",
