            "text": "A wide variety of microorganisms are transmitted within healthcare settings, posing significant threats to both patients and healthcare workers. Some pathogens, such as SARS associated coronavirus and Ebola, have the potential to disseminate widely in community populations. Other types of emergent threats are represented by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, many of which have become endemic in hospitals. Although a substantial body of knowledge has accumulated about the epidemiology of nosocomial, or hospital associated, infections, much remains unknown about modes of transmission. For instance, is acquisition of a pathogen a consequence of direct patient to patient contact, is it mediated by health care workers, or is it the result of general environmental contamination? Hospitals routinely collect and maintain extensive records of patient admission and discharge times to and from wards and units, and records are also available for the sample times and results of laboratory tests to detect pathogens colonizing and infecting patients. Colonization generally refers to the situation where bacteria are living on the skin or in other body sites without causing disease. Our usage of the term also refers to the state in which an individual is shedding an organism and capable of transmitting to others, i.e. is infectious. Clinical infection is disease caused by a microorganism. For bacteria that cause nosocomial infection, colonization typically precedes clinical infection. Because we do not analyse clinical data here, we are unable to distinguish asymptomatic colonization from clinical infection. The ultimate objective of our work is to reduce the rates of nosocomial infection. Hospital records have been used in a variety of ways to estimate rates of colonization and hence measure the effect of interventions designed to reduce acquisition rates. Our work focuses on patient level models as opposed to compartmental models (Cooper & Lipsitch, 2004; McBryde et al., 2007), and is thus very much in the vein of Forrester et al. (2007) and Cooper et al. (2008), and more recently, Kypraios et al. (2010), Worby et al. (2013) and Haverkate et al. (2015).",

Cooper et al. (2008) briefly reviewed previous attempts to address the problem before introducing an augmented data approach. In this, the observed data are augmented by the unobservable times of colonization, the values of which are repeatedly imputed based on current parameter values and the observed data. The imputations and parameter updates are made using Markov chain Monte Carlo stochastic integration (MCMC) which, with care, ensures that the parameter values so generated constitute a correlated sample from the posterior densities of the parameters in a Bayesian analysis. These methods can typically also be adapted for stochastic optimization to find maximum likelihood or maximum posterior estimates, but we will not consider this further in this work.",

(2008) was specified in continuous time, their program implemented a discrete time approximation. Thomas et al. (2015) gave a somewhat more efficient discrete time implementation, and provided a true continuous time solution. They showed that the continuous implementation was no more computationally demanding than the discrete time one, and moreover, eliminated some biases in parameter estimation. The programs we provide for the analyses described here are implemented in continuous time.",

            "text": "The novel contribution of this work is to extend the susceptible-infected, or SI, model which assumes that once colonized an individual immediately becomes infectious and remains so for the duration of the study, to models that allow for decolonization or loss of infectiousness, i.e. susceptible-infected-susceptible or SIS models, and for a latent period following exposure and preceding infectiousness, i.e. susceptible-exposed-infected-susceptible or SEIS models. The model assumption that the infectious state never resolves conflicts with the current body of knowledge about the nature of colonization. Substantial empirical evidence has accumulated that a variety of types of bacteria which colonize human hosts, including MRSA, can be lost and reacquired during follow-up (Huckabee et al., 2009; Haverkate et al., 2014; Shenoy et al., 2014). Rather than assuming that every negative surveillance test that occurs after a positive test is always a false negative, it is much more realistic to allow the possibility of decolonization. For the most part, information for estimating the decolonization rate comes from tests done on patients with previous positives tests, hence, this will be better estimated under a regime of regular surveillance testing. Incorporating a latent period enhances the realism of the model as, in nature, there is always some lag between transmission and onset of infectiousness in the newly colonized host. For SIS and SEIS models the number of transitions in different imputations of the augmented data can vary, and, thus, so will the dimensionality of the problem. We address this using reversible jump MCMC, or RJMCMC, updates for the patient histories that constitute the augmented data (Green, 1995).",

The movements of patients between units and time spent outside of any unit are tracked and the colonization status at readmission will depend on the status at previous discharge and the time between these events. A two- or three-state continuous time Markov process is used to model the out of facility colonization process depending on whether or not the model allows for a latent state. Models that assume that no patients are hospitalized more than once fail to account for the reality that readmission occurs with appreciable frequency. The reason this simplifying assumption is problematic is that readmission provides the key link between past transmission and future importation. The notion that this is an epidemiologically important relationship has received support in previous studies of MRSA colonization (Jones et al., 2015): lagged facility-level MRSA acquisition was found to be temporally correlated with admission prevalence. The out of unit decolonization rate is informed by the colonization status on readmission for patients likely to have been colonized on their discharge, and will decrease at the the time interval between hospitalization increases.",

(2008) in using the deviance information criterion (DIC), (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002) as both fit very naturally into our framework, although both require additional MCMC runs over and above those needed for parameter estimation. We make the slight extension from leave one out cross validation to a version that allows for arbitrary sets of tests to be omitted in the estimation phase before being predicted. Celeux et al. (2006) consider several possible versions of the DIC for missing data problems which treat the augmented variables variously as data or parameters. As the DIC requires calculation of deviances under fixed parameter estimates, we find it inappropriate in a context where the augmented variables are complete patient histories rather than simple numerical quantities, so that using a posterior mean estimate for example is not well defined. We, therefore, have chosen to implement what Celeux et al. (2006) refer to as \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}$DIC_6$\\end{document}, a version that treats the augmented variables as data. We also consider the widely applicable, or Watanabe\u2013Akaike, information criteria (WAIC) (Watanabe, 2010). This has the computational attraction of being calculable from statistics generated in the course of the simulation run for parameter estimation, thus, unlike cross validation and DIC it requires minimal additional effort. We will explore these model selection approaches in the example we have chosen to illustrate our methods. This will be an analysis of MRSA surveillance test results over a 1-year period from a Veterans Administration hospital comprising seven different units.",

On input, the event list is checked for consistency so that the admission and discharge times specify a coherent history of inpatient episodes, and that test events only occur during an episode. Multiple inpatient episodes for the same individual are identified and linked. If time data are not sufficiently precise, for instance, if reported only to the nearest day, then concurrent events are sorted so that admissions and discharges make a coherent history.

Thomas et al. (2015) parametrized their model in such a way that the dimensionality of the augmented data was constant. Cooper et al. (2008) framed their model so that the dimensionality changed depending on whether a patient experienced a colonization or not and used RJMCMC (Green, 1995) to account for this. We note in passing that since their model was in discrete time, RJMCMC was not strictly speaking necessary. As our model will allow for zero or multiple colonization, progression and decolonization events in a patient episode, and is a continuous time model, the dimensionality is truly variable and RJMCMC, which we employ, or an alternative such as birth-death MCMC (Stephens, 2000), is necessary.",

Full exploitation of this, however, is of questionable value as it can lead to serious over parametrization and the possibility of parameters becoming unidentifiable. Even in situations where, given the augmented data, parameters can be independently estimated, there may be identifiability issues when we integrate over the hidden variables. Evidence of this was shown by Thomas et al. (2015) where negative correlation was seen between, for instance, estimates of importation probabilities and in unit colonization rates with different imputations of the hidden variables explaining the observed positive tests as due to either importation or colonization. While such issues could be addressed by constraints imposed by strongly informative prior distributions, we would advise against these extensions other than where strongly justified by the data. One such situation is when qualitatively different tests are used for pathogen detection. For instance, MRSA surveillance tests usually use nasal or dermal swabs while clinical tests may use blood.",

The LCVPP ranks the SEIS unit specific constant colonization rate as the best overall and ranks it best of the 3 models in each category. The WAIC ranks the SEIS facility wide constant colonization rate model as the best overall. This brings into question somewhat the thinking behind the density and frequency dependent colonization assumptions. These are intended to model colonization by direct contact between colonized and susceptible patients when the number of potential interactions either grows linearly with the number of patients in the unit or is constant. Transmission of bacteria between patients is believed to be mediated primarily by contact involving healthcare workers and environmental surfaces rather than direct contact between patients, indeed, in many settings, particularly ICUs, patients are not mobile, so direct patient contact is unlikely. Thus, the environment can serve as a reservoir for acquisition after discharge or transfer of colonized patients. This likely depends on the cumulative recent history of colonized individuals in the unit, not simply on the instantaneous total. In modelling terms, it seems that there should be some lag in the system suggesting that moving average or other time series approaches should be investigated. A further factor may be that the mass action principle is less demonstrable if the prevalence or density of carriage shows little variation over time, and that distinguishing between frequency dependent and density dependent models will be difficult unless there is substantial variation in occupancy. Figure 1 shows that for the larger units, while there is substantial high frequency variation, occupancy numbers are generally stable, as are prevalence of carriage. Units 5, 6 and 7 show more variability, and some evidence of discrete outbreaks, however, the low numbers here limit statistical power. We conclude that because of the rarity of transmissions, distinguishing decisively between modes of transmission will require a larger study.",

The LCVPP also generally favours unit specific rates within SI and SIS categories. This is supported by a broad range of rate estimates across the units, as shown in Table 5. Neither the DIC nor the WAIC, however, follow the same pattern. We also note} that rate estimates correlate strongly and negatively with the size of the unit. There are far fewer observations on which to base rate estimates in the smaller units, and hence these have far larger posterior standard deviations. As these distributions are asymmetric the larger variability seems to also pull up the posterior mean. This suggests that using log normal priors, where the mean and variance can change independently, may be more appropriate although this, being non-conjugate, complicates computation. Cooper et al. (2008) used the log normal as did Khader et al. (2017) in an application of hierarchical modelling to compare colonization rates in a multi-unit intervention trial. We also note that unit 7 draws most of its patients from outside the system, thus, any positive tests observed there cannot be attributed to transfers from other units. Again, given the scarcity of transmissions, larger samples will be needed to overcome the influence of the priors and better evaluate evidence for different colonization rates in the units.",

The largest effect is that the false-negative test probability is larger for the SI models. Since, under these models, any negative test following a positive test must be a false negative, this is not surprising. While we have not made a formal analysis of Table 2, and note that for brevity we have curtailed the sequence runs at 5, informal inspection reveals more sequences that follow the positive\u2013negative pattern, favouring decolonization, than follow the positive\u2013negative\u2013positive pattern that would more strongly favour a higher false-negative rate. The average time spent in the latent state in SEIS models ranges from around 0.9 days for the constant model to around 3.2 days for the density dependent model. Estimates for the mean latent period for the outpatient process were broadly in line but showed more variability ranging from 0.8 to 13.1 days. Given that no data is collected during outpatient periods, the increased variability is not surprising. Although we consider the latency between colonization and detectability or infectiousness, as opposed to the more usual latency between acquisition and clinical infection, we would expect these to be of comparable magnitude and our estimates are consistent with what is known about MRSA (Dancer et al., 2006). Nonetheless, we hesitate to interpret these estimates too directly. It may be that any improvement in predictive power of the SEIS model over the SIS is less to do with the existence of a latent state per se, and more to do with the slight lag it introduces into the system as discussed above.",
