Comparative studies of experimental infection of adult humans with RSV, FLU, RV, and coxsackie A virus show that all of these viruses provoke a similar local symptom-sign presentation (with varying degrees of systemic involvement), nasal secretory response, pattern of complications (with varying frequencies), and a panel of elaborated inflammatory mediators (IMs), leukotrienes, and cytokines [9, 10] . Differences that exist among viruses primarily reflect the types of cells that are infected (tissue tropism) and thus the degree to which the infection is localized. For example, although RVs are generally confined to the upper airways by their sensitivity to temperature, RSV can be disseminated to the lung and middle ear by way of the contiguous mucosa and FLU can infect leukocytes via viremic dissemination. These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of the local, cold-like signs, symptoms, and complications is common to the different etiologic agents and most likely represents the consequences of a generalized host response to viral infection of the nasal mucosa.",

            "text": "Otitis media (OM) and sinusitis are common diseases for which both children and adults receive medical care each year [1] . Life-threatening complications of these diseases have been minimal following the introduction of antibiotics, but sequelae occasionally occur and may include bony erosion and facial nerve paralysis [2] . The cost of treating these disorders is between $4 and $6 billion per year. In addition, the patient or caregiver is absent from work on an average of 2 days per illness episode, with an estimated cost of $1 billion [3] . The increase in the prevalence of these diseases over the last 15-20 years has led to a similar increase in the use of antibiotics to treat the disease, despite the demonstration of their marginal efficacy in placebo-controlled trials. This is a credible explanation for the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a phenomenon that is generating increasing concern as inexpensive, first-line antibiotics used to treat common diseases such as OM and sinusitis are becoming ineffective [4] . vURIs are extremely common in children and adults. For most segments of the population, this condition is self-limited and associated with relatively short periods of morbidity. However, in infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised, infection with some of the causal viruses is associated with significant excess morbidity and, in some cases, even mortality. Also, vURIs are well established as predisposing to other diseases involving the paranasal sinuses, middle ears, and lungs [5] [6] [7] . These complications are characterized by a more prolonged time course than that of the precipitating vURI and are often refractory to conventional medical treatment. For example, respiratory synctial virus (RSV) infection, which has been long recognized as a cause of severe lower respiratory illness and complications in infants and young children, was recently shown to signficantly increase morbidity and mortality in the elderly [8] . Medications of questionable efficacy sold for the relief of symptoms and signs of vURIs represent a major component of the overthe-counter drug market, and prescription medications for treating associated complications including sinusitis, OM, and pneumonia represent a significant financial burden to society. These costs are compounded by the decreased economic productivity resulting from the large number of days lost to industry and education.",

            "text": "The role of IMs has been the focus of recent studies on vURI pathogenesis. The similarity between the clinical manifestations of allergic rhinitis and the common cold has prompted repeated attempts to establish a role for histamine and other IMs in the pathogenesis of vURIs. Three generalized methods have been used to provide evidence for a role of IMs and cytokines in the pathogenesis of vURIs: (1) documentation of a time-dependent increase in the concentration of the IM/cytokine (in nasal secretion, blood, or urine) during the period of infection that parallels the symptoms; (2) provocation of signs, symptoms, and mucosal inflammation by topical application of the IM/cytokine; and (3) moderation of the inflammatory process or symptom expression by inhibitors of these IMs/cytokines. Histamine, a classic mediator of allergic rhinitis, is stored in the granules of tissue mast cells and circulating basophils and is released immediately upon cellular contact with a variety of stimuli. Local histamine in nasal secretions [9] and urinary histamine metabolites can be detected during vURIs [16] . Mucosally applied histamine triggers a full spectrum of rhinitis symptoms and is the only mediator studied that provokes sneezing [17] . Of interest, antihistamine treatment during vURIs consistently depresses symptoms and signs of sneezing and rhinorrhea, but has little effect on the other aspects of disease expression [18] . Bradykinin is a potent mediator of inflammation and is synthesized locally from precursors delivered with other serum proteins, by transudation. Application of bradykinin to the nasal mucosa provokes rhinorrhea, congestion, facial pain, and sore throat [17] . Kinins were found in the nasal secretions recovered from subjects with experimental and natural vURIs [19] . The concentration and time course of the production of kinins are correlated with symptom severity. However, steroid therapy significantly reduces kinins in nasal lavage fluids, but has no effect on the symptoms, and bradykinin antagonists have not affected the signs and symptoms in a number of experimental RV studies [20] .",

The sulfidopeptide LTs increase the permeability of postcapillary venules and facilitate plasma leakage, edema formation, and cellular diapedesis [21] . LTB 4 is one of the most potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and, to a lesser degree, eosinophils. Both the sulfidopeptide LTs and LTB 4 are potent enhancers of mucus secretion. According to data on a 5-lipoxygenase knockout mouse model, LTs are critically involved in many, but not all, causes of inflammation. Combined with the results reported for mast cell-deficient mice, chemotactic LTs released by mast cells can be shown to be important in neutrophil recruitment during the early acute inflammatory response to insult. Elevated levels of LTs were observed in nasal secretions of children infected with RSV, parainfluenza virus, and FLU and in experimentally infected adults [22] . Moreover, LTs applied directly to the nasal mucosa in noninfected individuals reproduced symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea [23] . Both 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors and LTD 4 antagonists have efficacy in treating nasal congestion in allergic rhinitis. Montelukast, an LT receptor antagonist, has been shown to be effective in reducing cough, wheezing, dyspnea, and limitation of activity in infants during RSV infection, however, its ability to prevent vURIs, otitis media, or sinusitis has not been demonstrated [24] .",

It is hypothesized that virus infection provokes the release from epithelial cells of IL-11 and endothelins (ETs), which conjointly and synergistically activate nociceptive nerves, leading to local mucosal axon responses and the subsequent release of inflammatory neuropeptides. These peptides, in turn, cause neurogenic inflammation, which is expressed as nasal irritation, sneezing (nociceptive nerve activation), engorgement of venous sinusoids (mucosal swelling with decreased nasal patency), increased vascular permeability (major source of rhinorrhea fluid), glandular exocytosis, low-grade inflammatory cell infiltration, and reflex obstruction of the eustachian tube and sinus ostia. Evidence also indicates that neurogenic inflammation may be upregulated during allergic inflammation. Nasal secretions obtained from patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) and healthy controls were compared following whole-nose capsaicin provocation. Subjects from the PAR group exhibited plasma extravasation while the control group did not, likely resulting from neuropeptide release by capsaicin-sensitve fibers [27, 28] .",

In other inflammatory diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, ETs and IL-11 are released, stimulate nociceptive neurons, and recruit parasympathetic reflexes. Also, in allergen challenge studies, the release of substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and vasoactive intestinal peptide is associated with itch, nasal blockage, and rhinorrhea, showing that these nociceptive neuropeptides can be measured in nasal secretions and that their concentrations are related to specific symptoms [32] .

The cytokine network provides a complex and highly interactive mechanism for regulation and amplification of the immune system and inflammatory response. During an inflammatory event, proinflammatory cytokines are typically upregulated in a cascading fashion. On the continuum of proinflammatory and immune system-stimulating chemicals, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) hold central roles. TNF-\u03b1 is the first cytokine to be upregulated in response to an inflammatory stimulus, with levels peaking within several hours. IL-1 is the second cytokine to be upregulated, with levels peaking within 24-48 h. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 then trigger the sequential upregulation of other cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.

Severity of RSV infection in infants and adults has been shown to be associated with polymorphism in certain alleles of Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b2 genotypes, respectively [52, 53] . Polymorphism of the TNF-\u03b2 gene has also been shown to form a component of genetic predisposition to chronic sinusitis [54] .

Moreover, mortality was reduced in those animals treated with IL-1ra. Another recently developed tool is cytokine genotyping. Recent studies demonstrated associations between specific cytokine genotypes associated with high production of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 and increased susceptibility to several infectious diseases [56] . These results suggest that certain cytokines are necessary for the development of symptomatology during vURIs and that specific cytokine polymorphisms may be associated with increased susceptibility to viral rhinitis and its complications.",

            "text": "In summary, cytokines promote the initiation, amplification, and persistence of inflammation by their direct cellular effects and by their role in inducing synthesis or release of other inflammatory chemicals in a cascading fashion. A common pathway in vURIs may be the early release of nonspecific, host-alert cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. These have both local effects (e.g., depress protein synthesis and upregulate major histocompatibility complex presentation) and systemic effects (e.g., pyrogenic and stem cell maturation) that are expressed as the more general symptoms and signs of illness (e.g., fever and malaise). They also upregulate integrin and selectin expression and thereby mediate the local recruitment of inflammatory cells, which in turn promotes the release or synthesis of IMs (e.g., histamine, bradykinin, eicosanoids, and other cytokines). Some of those IMs initiate neurogenic inflammation and increased vascular permeability (rhinorrhea) and cause sneezing, cough, and nasal congestion. In a cascading and networking fashion, TNF-a and IL-1 also regulate the production of other pro-or anti-inflammatory cytokines via transcription factor activation in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Additionally, there is strong evidence for cross talk between IMs, especially those products of the lipoxygenase pathway and the cytokines. In spite of the data demonstrating an association between cytokines and symptoms of vURIs, the role of these mediators in pathogenesis will not be clear until specific inhibitors are available for use in clinical trials.",

For certain pathogens, viral rhinitis and its complications can be prevented by effective immunization against the precipitating virus or by effective antiviral prophylaxis or treatment. For example, populations at risk for severe FLU-or RSV-induced lower respiratory illness can be actively immunized with a FLU vaccine or passively immunized with an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody [57, 58] . Moreover, several antiviral agents are available for prophylaxis or treatment [59] . These include ribavirin for RSV and amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir for FLU. Antiviral agents for RV, such as pleconaril, are currently under development and testing. However, at present, the use of immunization or antiviral agents is not applicable to the majority of episodes of vURIs for several reasons: (1) the large number of causative viruses; (2) the high degree of antigenic variability exhibited by most of these viruses; (3) the limited arsenal, high specificity, and significant side-effects of available antivirals; and (4) concerns regarding selection of resistant virus strains during extended antiviral prophylaxis [60] .",
