Like many of you at this point, I'm struggling with how to be fully informed but not be overwhelmed with information that's not always accurate. We've rescheduled many patients in our pediatric primary care site, so while at home I'm doing online training in telehealth and will be helping to staff our clinic's call center. Being geographically close to New York City, I see ambulatory clinic space, school-based health centers and even the gymnasium at Yale University being converted to patient care centers. I constantly think of friends and colleagues who are in the middle of all this: caring for patients in the ICU, redistributing and prioritizing resources in the hospital, and now living in hotel rooms close to the hospital and working 12-hour shifts. I'm also incredibly grateful for the timeliness and transparency of communications from my university and academic health center, while knowing that the information and knowledge is so fluid, and changes hour by hour.",

I watch daily updates from the nation's infectious disease experts and local, state and national politicians (with some being better than others). I think a lot about families, parents and caregivers with young children at home, trying to juggle so many responsibilities. My children are now adults, but if I were home schooling them (which would not have been pretty), I think I would be more concerned about their mental health, communication and coping abilities than any academic progress they might be making \u2013 because we're all in this together.",

Even with 9/11, as bad as that was, I felt like I knew what we had to do: we had to get out, support small businesses, go out for dinner and, most importantly, connect with each other. But with the uniqueness and uncertainly of this current challenge, I'm not sure of the way forward.",

            "text": "Where will we be when this is behind us? There will be a lot of healing and processing to do as we venture out into a new world. If there are some silver linings, there are a few things I look forward to. For example, we will all be more technologically expert in teaching online, meeting through Zoom, and doing telehealth. We will be more open to alternative ways of doing our work - and not because things have always been done a certain way, but because there will be a new normal. And we will also learn that important decisions that benefit the greater good can be quickly and easily made. For example, we are now seeing barriers break down regarding impediments to multi-state licensure, and requirements for collaborative practice agreements being removed. We will learn how to better assess competency in the performance of our students, rather than over-relying on a certain number of clinical hours that they have accumulated. Such things can and should happen, without endless town halls, testimonies, and advocacy efforts that simply take up too much time and too many resources. That said, we will be able to ramp up our research and data collection efforts, as we seek to hopefully prevent and mitigate future pandemics, while also enabling all nurses and providers to practice to the full extent of their education and license.",

            "text": "Lastly, as I write this, I'm reminded of a particularly timely article on Florence Nightingale, just published in the March issue of Smithsonian Magazine which I would recommend to you (Hammer, 2020). This article was no doubt planned for publication well before any of us heard of Covid-19, given that this year we are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Ms. Nightingale's birth. The article offers a fresh review of the intellectual drive, advocacy efforts and defiance of Victorian conventions by this most celebrated woman of her time who was one of the first to assert that health care is a human right. To be reminded of her work as a health care and social reformer is a good lesson for all of us.",
