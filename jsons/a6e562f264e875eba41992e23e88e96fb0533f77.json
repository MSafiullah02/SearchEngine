It takes into account that not all health rights and threats are of the same caliber, that prioritization is a necessity. It also acknowledges that not all risks and threats can be anticipated or annulled. Bearing these limitations in mind, the chapter re-frames health risks in terms of a re-ordering of health security at the level of local, national, and global policy. It also offers theoretical as well as concrete suggestions on how it might be possible to conceptualize, communicate, and confront health risks and threats with states, non-state actors and other agents to facilitate health rights responsibility within and across borders.",

When and where an outbreak spreads beyond the coping strategies of a local community, and especially when it does so beyond those of the national state, the scope of response expands exponentially. It is at this intersection of responsibilities-local/national and national/international, that the question of intervention by militaries may enter the equation. This is because in contrast to NGOs and NSAs, which are equipped to provide a service and support health(care) security within the rubric of an existing national structure, militaries are geared towards establishing that structure where it is either fragile or non-existent. In other words, MSF could provide Ebola care in Guinea as long as the outbreak was either small enough for their facilities and tracers to be able to follow contacts and administer care, or the national state was able to make up any difference. As the case proved, the first option existed until the scope of the epidemic exceeded MSF's capacities. The Guinean state was overwhelmed from the outset. MSF called for foreign military intervention then to bridge the gap in local/national incapacity with international structural-logistical-aid in the form of military support.",

Although Gertler acknowledges the huge political reverberations caused by that call, he would do it again in a similar situation. Yet, the military disappointed. It took much longer to arrive than anticipated, hamstrung by national security rules. Nonetheless, Gertler argues that despite this, that sending and resending the same NGO/NSA volunteers presents a riskier strategy.

Historically, as seen with regard to Indonesia and its invocation of \"viral sovereignty,\" as well as in the initial reactions to the EVD pandemic in West Africa, above, fear of suffering (catastrophic) economic and reputational losses due to a declared outbreak was, for a long time, a reason for states to desist from doing so. Thus, in order to incentivize them to report outbreak threats and/or outbreaks, the IHR included the above provision to protect international traffic and trade. With a view toward the future, and as again seen with respect to the international responses mounted to EVD and current to Zika, it becomes clear that international traffic-such as for the Olympic Games-and trade, including in and of medications, play prominent, paramount roles in any disease response. More significant at this stage of Zika appears to be the expansion of the mosquito territories, spreading the virus with it. As such, international traffic and trade, but also vector presence, are both intrinsically and instrumentally tied to disease response and the protection of health.",

For instance, State A gives State B or NSA X the authority to delivery health care against disease Y. In the first instance of State primacy, all actors involved in disease Y defer to the State's authority, and the State retains responsibility and accountability for health responses. In the second instance of (d)evolutions, those States or NSAs to whom authority is (d)evolved assume responsibilityand accountability vis-\u00e0-vis the deferring State for the health of its citizens. 2. Level 2: Agreeing to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between a (weak) State A and a (stronger) State B in terms of (military) logistical support in the event of a (zoonotic) epidemic presents a pre-emptive possibility to order health security before a risk becomes a threat.
