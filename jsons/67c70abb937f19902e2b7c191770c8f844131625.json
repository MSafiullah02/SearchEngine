Imposing emergency lockdown to stop infection of COVID 19 virus on 24.03.2020 in India has created economic crisis but it has facilitated environment to restore its quality. Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM10 concentration was 189 to 278\u00b5g/m 3 in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 \u00b5g/m 3 after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3-5\u00baC, noise level is dropped to <65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period. Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to the river. For instance, total Journal Pre-proof",

            "text": "emissions (CPCB, 2020) . PM 2.5 and Pm 10 were also steeply decreasing. Between 23 and 29 March, the most prominent NO 2 decrease was observed when the concentration dropped to 10 \u03bcg / m 3 . He et al., (2020) reported that the Air Quality Index and PM2.5 concentrations is decreased by 25 percent during the lock-off time spanning a few weeks while worked with Chineese cities. Cadotte, (2020) also reported decreasing air pollutants over major cities of the world where the outbreak is very strong. In Seoul, capital of South Korea, PM 2.5 has reduced by 54% in lockdown period than the same time of the previous year. In Wuhan air quality is improved by 44%. Ogen, (2020) has found a strong link between the concentration of NO2 and fatality caused by COVID-19 in another study of areas in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany. Lee, et al. (2011) , Yap et al., (2011) , Yap and Hashim, (2013) , Chitranshi, Sharma, and Dey, (2015) ; Pal and Mandal, (2019a, b) , , Olmanson, et al., (2016) , Alvarez-Mendoza et al., (2019) have warned about the growth of PM concentration in lower atmosphere due to human activities. Most of them had computed the PM using either Landsat or MODIS products. Concentration of green house gases like SO2, NO2, CO, PM etc are considered as dominant causes of temperature rise in atmosphere. Bashir et al (2020) found a linkage between air quality parameters and climate parameters like temperature, humidity, air movement etc. Anderson et al. (2016) , Jerez et al. (2018) , Manabe (2019) reported that the high accumulation of green house gases may augment the temperature and associated other climatic components like fog, dew, precipitation etc. Along with such global level studies a few works have also done in Indian subcontinent. reported concentration of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO 2 , NO 2 , ozone (O 3 ) and SO 2 over 22 cities of India in March and April, 2020 and compared the result with same window time of 2017 in order to explain air quality improvement in India. This lockdown is a breakthrough in this mounting concern. Along with air quality, noise pollution is reduced as transport and industry are the major sources of noise (Tonne et al., 2016; Abdullah et J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 al., 2020 ). It is to be mentioned that due to noise pollution so many people experiences direct and indirect harms over the world (Pal and Mandal, 2019) . Deafness, high blood pressure, heart failure are some of the crudest consequences of noise. Worldwide, 360 million peoples are prone to hearing loss due to noise. Out of them, 27% and 22% are in South and East Asia respectively. Among different forms of noises, noise at occupational place is the most crucial reason behind hearing loss (WHO, 2012).Significant reduction of pollutant water from the different economic sectors is noticed. The New Indian Express on 24.04.2020 reported that water quality of river Ganga, in India is improved by 40-50% during the time of lockdown. CPCB (2020) reported that Dissolved oxygen (DO) (more than 6 mg/litre), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (less than 2 mg/litre), total coliform (5000 per 100 ml) and pH (range between 6.5 and 8.5) have improved a lot and the identified range of the quality components are within the range of bathing. Different Government reports, reports of the researchers have heighted the glimpse of the effects of COVID 19 pandemic over the major cities of the world.",

            "text": "The Dwarka River -a tributary of Mayurakshi is a well-known name in the river scenario of West Bengal and Jharkhand states of Eastern India. The middle catchment of the basin (area: 3883 km 2 ) is rich with crystalline granite rocks as these are the extended parts of Chottanagpur plateau. There are 239 stone mining and 982 stone crushing centres at the very vicinity of residential areas of poor economic background (Fig. 1) . These mining & crushing centres are used to produce approximately ~ 258120 tons of dust per year (Pal & Mandal, 2017) and it causes serious threats to the environmental components like air, water, soil (Pal and Mandal, 2017; Pal and Mandal, 2019a; Pal and Mandal, 2019b) . These stone quarrying and crushing centres are in operational mode almost every day of the year. But when the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 Indian government announced the country lockdown on 24.03.2020 to prevent the infection of the COVID-19, these were shut down temporarily. For in-depth spatial analysis, we have selected four densely found quarrying and crushing areas from the middle catchment defining cluster 1 to 4 with an area of 19.36 km 2 each. Entire river basin possesses more than ten such mining and quarrying clusters but purposively we have selected those four where the frequency of crushing unit is maximum. These quarrying and crushing units have generated livelihood opportunity but huge dust emission in different forms have negative impact on environment and human health (Pal and Mandal, 2019; Han et al., 2020) . Policy makers are worried for formulating suitable abatement policies. Researchers at global level have reported the positive impact of lockdown on air quality. But its possible impact at regional and local scale is yet not explored. Considering this gap of research the present study has intended to explore the impact of lockdown on environment in general and some specific environmental components like on PM concentration in air, change of land surface temperature, noise ambience and river water in the stone quarrying and crushing dominated areas of Eastern India.

The distance of steep change is different across the clusters and it is mainly due to areal extent of crusher concentration. This distance of steep change of PM 10 is different at different directions from same crusher unit. Figure 4 demonstrates spatial pattern of LST across the clusters in pre and during lockdown periods. Highest temperature is usually found in an around the stone quarrying and crushing units. A Pre lockdown LST record shows the fact. Historical time series LST on those areas also recorded high temperature in these areas and over the time with increasing density of crushing units the LST is registered high (Pal and Mandal, 2019a) . This thermal condition adversely affects even the health of the workers and proximate local people. But amid lockdown the LST is reduced considerably. For instance, in pre lockdown period, maximum recorded temperature varies from 35.49 to 38.48 \u00baC and just after four days of commencing lockdown it is reduced by 3.24 -5.07 \u00baC and 4 to 6.5 \u00baC after 18 days.

The reduced amount is due to the effect of anthropogenic activities. Table 4 Cluster wise levels of LST value in Pre lockdown and during the lockdown periods",

Continuous emission of dust particles crushed due to stone crushing since morning to evening add huge volume of dust into the atmosphere, water body and contaminate the quality of air and water. Particulate matter concentration above 100 is harmful for human health (WHO 2006) . Inhaling fine dust particles for long time often creates different respiratory diseases and also invite deaths (WHO 2006; WHO 2016; WHO 2018) . Around 29% of lung cancer deaths, 24% stroke deaths, 25% cardiac disease death and 43% other lung disease are reported to be causing air pollution (Wu et al., 2020) . Also, air pollution caused 26% deaths from respiratory illness, 25% deaths from COPD and some 17% deaths from ischemic heart and stroke (WHO 2020) . At this point, it should be noted that for those with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, the COVID-19 death rate is significantly higher. Such diseases are also related to air pollution, which means air pollution can be seen as a secondary factor in these deaths Travaglio et al., 2020) . Past studies have verified the effect of air pollution on the health conditions. Several studies have shown that air pollution exposure has that health risks linked with respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary and other results related to health in the past decades, creating significant interest in air pollution (Karimzadegan et al., 2008; Xing et al., 2016; Isaifan, 2020; Peshave and Peshave, 2020) . In their previous studies, Pal and Mandal (2019) showed how the stone quarrying and crushing process is adding dust particles to the air day after day. They have estimated aerosol concentration from the region from 2014 to 2017 in season-wise at lower atmosphere. The average PM 10 value in summer season was 183.24 and winter PM 10 value was 224.33. So it is important to say that the PM 10 value is always very high in this area.",
