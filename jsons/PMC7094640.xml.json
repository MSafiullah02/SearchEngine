            "text": "With a high death rate attributed to high mortality and unsatisfactory treatment options, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignant cancers worldwide [1], [2], [3]. So effective therapeutic tools, such as gene therapy, should be developed for HCC treatment. For instance, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by binding to complementary sequences in mRNAs [4], [5]. The dysregulation of miRNAs play critical roles in tumor initiation and development. One of the well-known miRNAs is miR-21, which is highly expressed and plays important role in various types of cancers, including colon cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and HCC [6], [7], [8], [9]. In contrast, miR-34a, miR-15-/16 cluster, and let-7 miRNA are usually expressed at low levels in different malignant cancers [10], [11], [12], [13]. However, few studies have focused on cancer regulation of miR-208, which promotes cell proliferation of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and contributes to cell metastasis and invasion by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells [14], [15].",

Human ARID superfamily includes 15 members, which are subunits of SWI/SNF complexes. Human ARID2 protein contains a conservative N-terminal ARID, an RFX-type winged helix, a proline- and glutamine-rich region, and two conservative C-terminal C2H2 Zn-finger motifs [17]. ARID-containing proteins are involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development, cell lineage gene regulation, and cell cycle control. ARID2 is also implicated in tumor progression, as described in previous studies. For example, ARID2 have been found to be mutated and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in HCC [18], [19]. In non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, loss-of-function mutations of ARID2 have also frequently occurred [20], [21]. Although the crucial roles of ARID2 in cancer have been extensively investigated, the correlation between miR-208-3p and ARID2 in HCC remains unclear.",

In addition, miR-208-3p down-regulation inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. This down-regulation of miR-208-3p also suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Morever, ARID2 was confirmed to be regulated by miR-208-3p directly, and the depletion of ARID2 could reverse the effect of miR-208-3p down-regulation in HCC cells. These results indicated the important role of miR-208-3p/ARID2 in HCC and may also provide a basis to develop new and potent therapeutic agents for HCC treatment.",

Western blot analysis results in HCC cells showed that ARID2 protein level was lower in HepG2 and Hep3B than that in the three other cell lines (\nFig. 1A). qRT-PCR results showed that two cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3b, with high expression level of miR-208-3p. In addition, miR-208-3p expression was higher than those of the three other miRNAs in HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines (Fig. 1B and C). To further confirm the correlation between miR-208-3p and ARID2, we transfected miR-208-3p inhibitor in HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines. qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that ARID2 protein levels were up-regulated after miR-208-3p was inhibited (Fig. 1D and E). Luciferase reporter assay was then performed to confirm that miR-208-3p directly bound to the 3\u2032-UTR of ARID2 (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, we found that ARID2 mRNA levels were lower in HCC speciments and inversely correlated miR-208-3p expression (Fig. 1G and H). These observations demonstrated that miR-208-3p could directly bind to the 3\u2032-UTR of ARID2 and repress its expression.",

The results showed that miR-208-3p repressed ARID2 expression and directly targeted ARID2 by binding to its 3\u2032-UTR. ARID2 undergoes mutation and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in small cell lung carcinoma and HCC [19], [20]. In this study, ARID2 expression was down-regulated, and ARID2 over-expression inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, ARID2 expression could partly reverse the effect of miR-208-3p down-regulation on HCC cell progression. As a subunit of PBAF, ARID2 was also found to regulate the expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) [16]. IFITM1 is an IFN-induced antiviral protein which prevent multiple virus entry, including SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Dengue virus (DNV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. IFITM1 was also found to regulate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. For example, in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, IFITM1 overexpression promoted and IFITM1 knockdown suppressed the invasion of HNSCC cells in vitro [31]. While, IFITM1 could enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 and negatively regulated HCC cell cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [32]. miR-208 was shown to be regulated by TGF\u03b21 in rat cardiac myoblasts [33]. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling pathway is a double-edged sword in tumor development. As a member of TGF\u03b2 family, dual-role of TGF\u03b21 has also been found in cancer progression. In metastatic prostate cancer cells, TGF\u03b21 was found to suppressed the growth and motility by inducing SMADs [34]. While in HCC, over-expression of TGF-\u03b21 could promote cell progression and Hepatocarcinogenesis [35], [36]. Here we found that depletion of TGF\u03b21 by siRNA repressed miR-208-3p, upregulated ARID2 and IFITM1 expression. This up-regulation of ARID2 and IFITM1 were down-regulated by transfection of miR-208-3p mimics in TGF\u03b21 siRNA and miR-208-3p mimics co-transfection group. Furthermore, the inhibition of HCC cell invasion and colony formation ability caused by TGF\u03b21 siRNA were partly reversed by miR-208-3p mimics. These results may provide insights into ARID2 regulatory network in cancer.",
