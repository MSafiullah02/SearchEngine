Simultaneously, the total number of online consultations exceeded 4.26 million from January 22 to February 25, which increased by 278% compared with that of last month. 9 Internet hospitals are running smoothly in China thanks to the following aspects. Firstly, Chinese government has issued a series of policies to integrate online medical services and long-term prescription into medical insurance. 10 Secondly, efficient express service makes for contactless drug delivery. What's more, innovative technologies, such as AI, 5G, and big data have been applied.
