For nearly 100 years, influenza A viruses have been a global threat to humans (Palese, 2004). Based on the antigenicity of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, influenza A viruses are classified into two groups and at least 16 different subtypes (H1-H16). The HA protein is the functional protein that mediates the entry of influenza viruses into susceptible host cells and thus contains various epitopes that are recognized by neutralizing antibodies (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). However, heterosubtypic neutralizing or protective antibody responses are rarely observed in the general population, largely because of the high mutation rate of the HA protein, especially in the globular head (HA1) region, which is the primary target of the humoral immune response. Consequently, when a new reassortant influenza virus emerges that the human immune system has not previously encountered, a pandemic may occur. The 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza is an example of such a pandemic.",

Nucleotide sequence alignment has shown that the HA sequence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is divergent from the sequences of the seasonal H1 influenza viruses that have previously been circulating in humans. The antigenicity of the HA in this strain is also highly distinct from that of the previously circulating H1 influenza viruses (Garten et al., 2009, Hancock et al., 2009). People, especially young people, generally lacked protection against this new virus (Hancock et al., 2009), and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccines have been proven effective in inducing neutralizing antibody responses against the pandemic influenza virus (Liang et al., 2010, Zhu et al., 2009).",

We obtained 19 monoclonal antibodies from the memory B cells of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine recipient and confirmed that all 19 of the monoclonal antibodies recognized the lysates of both the pandemic virus and the recently circulating seasonal H1N1 influenza virus. Seven of the human monoclonal antibodies were further found to have apparent neutralizing effects against different subtypes of influenza A viruses, including viruses belonging to both group 1 and group 2 and the pandemic influenza virus. Interestingly, we found that most of the monoclonal antibodies, including the seven neutralizing mAbs, bound to the HA stem region (HA2), which is relatively conserved among different influenza A virus strains. These findings indicate that a broad cross-subtype neutralizing antibody response targeting the HA stem region exists in individuals vaccinated against 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza and that these broadly reactive memory B cells may be important for protecting humans from infection with different influenza A viruses. A functional analysis revealed that the HA2 region contained several (at least four) conserved neutralizing epitopes that could be recognized by the raised mAbs. Further experiments showed that one of them was a linear epitope (FIEGGWTGMVDGWYGYHH), which was in the region of the fusion peptide on HA2. These results may be helpful in the design of universal influenza vaccines.",

These mAbs used different V, D, and J gene segments in their heavy and light chain variable genes; the V, D, and J usage is presented in detail in\nTable 1. The presence of somatic mutations in the 19 mAbs revealed that most of the B cells producing these mAbs were from the germinal center. Notably, five of the mAbs used the VH1-69 gene; the use of this gene is considered to be a non-exclusive characteristic of heterosubtypic binding to the HA stem region, with a neutralizing effect (Ekiert et al., 2009, Sui et al., 2009).

All of the mAbs bound to the 2008\u201309 seasonal H1 influenza (A/Brisbane/59/2007) virus lysate and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus lysate, but their binding avidities were different (Fig. 2B). An insect cell-expressed HA1 domain protein from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus was also used to analyze the binding activity between HA1 and the mAbs. As shown in Fig. 2A, only one mAb, 3D2, exhibited binding activity to the HA1 domain, whereas all of the other mAbs did not bind to HA1. These results suggest that the other mAbs may bind to the HA2 domain. These results indicate that memory B cells from people vaccinated with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine can secrete antibodies that primarily target the HA2 region, and these antibodies are cross-reactive with the 2008\u201309 seasonal H1 influenza virus.",

As shown in\nFig. 6, 1F2, 1F4, and 1E1 could specifically recognize peptide no. 2 (FIEGGWTGMVDGWYGYHH) in the ELISA assay, which is in the location of the fusion peptide that is believed to be very conserved among different strains of influenza A viruses (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). Sequence alignment shows that some amino acid residuals in the linear epitope are very conserved among the tested viruses of different subtypes (\nFig. 7). The conserved amino acid residuals may play critical roles in recognition of the epitope by the cross-subtype neutralizing mAbs. Based on this observation, it is concluded that 1F2, 1F4, and 1E1 recognize a linear epitope in the fusion peptide region. The other mAbs (1G1, 1C4, 3C4, and 3E1) showed no significant reaction with the peptides, suggesting that they target conformational epitopes. We will analyze the complex of the HA protein together with the mAbs and use structural biology methods to reveal the characteristics of the epitopes recognized by the mAbs (1G1, 1C4, 3C4, and 3E1).",
