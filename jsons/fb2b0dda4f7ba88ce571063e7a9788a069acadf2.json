Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell.

At the time of writing, some form of State-imposed lockdown has been applied to the residents of many European countries, including France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Guided by epidemiological models (1, 2) , the rationale for restricting movement is to save as many lives as possible in the short and medium run. In much of the discourse, the main cost of this confinement has been in terms of the Economy. However, while the cost of lockdown on GDP is considerable, it is possible that there is additional substantial damage to population well-being. Joblessness, social isolation and the lack of freedom, which are some of the byproducts of lockdown, are all well-known risk factors for mental health and unhappiness (3, 4, 5) .",

These estimated breaks are depicted in Figures S5 and S6 for 2020 and 2019, and the estimated coefficients are listed in Table S5 . These immediate effects are consistent with those in the event studies: the immediate effect of lockdown was to increase boredom and impairment, reduce panic, but to have little short-run impact on stress, sadness, suicide or worry. DiD and RDD-DiD measure different lockdown effects. The former compares all pre-lockdown observations to all post-lockdown observations, whereas RDD-DiD picks up the immediate effect in the few days around lockdown announcement.

The two figures are similar. We also repeat the same exercise for the US where there was a partial lockdown in some cities and counties before the implementation of a full lockdown at the State level. Figure S8 shows We see evidence of mean-reversion in some of these measures, perhaps reflecting individuals' hopes that the lockdown will only be relatively short. Nevertheless, the lockdown effects on boredom and worry have not dissipated over time, and more generally well-being in the first few weeks of lockdown may be only a poor guide to its level after one or two months: we may see accumulated \"behavioural fatigue\" (14) as individuals grow increasingly tired of self-regulating as time passes. To avoid social unrest, it may be necessary to emphasize the health benefits of lockdown (including preparation for testing and tracing after release to avoid a second wave), and make sure that appropriate support is provided to help those struggling the most with lockdown, starting with vulnerable groups (15) .",

Lockdown is associated with a significant rise in search intensity for boredom in both Europe ( = 35.8, < .01) and the US ( = 24.0, < .01). We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness (= 15.9, < .01; = 4.2, < .1), worry ( = 12.0, < .01; = 4.1, < .1) and sadness ( = 4.6, < .1; = 4.1, < .01). The effect size for boredom is large, at two times the standard deviation in Europe and over one standard deviation in the US. The loneliness and worry coefficients are over one half of a standard deviation in Europe, but lower in the US. These can be compared to the estimated standard-deviation effect of 9/11 on mental health of 0.1 to 0.3 (10) and depression of 0.5 (11) in the US, and an effect on psychological well-being in the UK of 0.07 (12). The Boston Bombing had an estimated effect on happiness and net affect of one-third of a standard deviation (13).We also see noticeable drops in stress ( < .01) in both samples. We found no discernible effect on impairment and a lockdown effect on sleep only in Europe.Strikingly, the lockdown has a positive effect on the search intensity for the topic of well-being in the US ( = 13.6, < .01) but a negative effect in Europe ( = \u221217.3, <",

Despite the clear message from the government that we should all stay at home to save lives, the evidence of a substantial increase in the search intensity on boredom, sadness, loneliness, and worry post-lockdown suggests that people's mental health has been adversely affected during the first few weeks of lockdown.",
