High sensitivity and short analysis time along with the ability to detect several pathogens in a single sample are advantages compared with serology, viral culture and antigen detection.1, 2, 3 PCR assays may enhance identification of viral respiratory pathogens by at least 50% compared with traditional diagnostic methods,4, 5, 6 partly by detecting viruses for which no conventional methods exist, such as human rhinovirus (hRV), human coronavirus (hCoV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Kaye et al.7 found a respiratory virus as the only causative agent in 15% of adult patients admitted to hospital with acute RTI. In patients with severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care treatment, who had negative bacterial cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, Legoff et al.8 reported detection of a respiratory virus in as much as 63% of cases. Viruses believed to cause only mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), for example hRV and hCoV have been detected in the lower respiratory tract in patients with severe disease.9, 10, 11 On the other hand, it is not known if asymptomatic shedding occurs following clinical recovery or during subclinical infection, and results of molecular methods with high sensitivity must be assessed with caution regarding the clinical relevance of the finding.",

Templeton et al. reported a detection rate of only 24%, but hRV, hCoV, AdV or hMPV were not included in their panel.23 Studies performed retrospectively on clinical samples will select for a short duration of symptoms as will studies including children, who tend to seek medical care early and who may shed more virus during a longer time period. Thus, the prospective approach and the adult population may explain the relatively low detection rate found in our sample. As the study period included the influenza season, we detected influenza A and B virus in a relatively high proportion of patients (41%), which is comparable to other studies of adults.9\n",

Although most studies do not include controls, Creer et al.16 found a respiratory virus in 12% of controls, who reported no signs of respiratory tract infection during 2 months before sampling, predominantly hRV. Asymptomatic shedding of hRV, RSV and PIV has also been reported in immunocompromised patients.24, 25 Our results suggest that viral shedding exceeding 14 days is rare in immunocompetent adults. The rate of asymptomatic carriage of virus might be affected by epidemiological factors that vary over time. Our control samples were, however, collected throughout the entire study period.",

The high genetic variability of hRVs, which increase the probability of probe-target mismatch, may explain this. For other viruses, such as influenza B virus, with less genetic variability viral detection will be more stable. The lack of association between duration of illness and Ct values in hRV infection may also reflect variations in viral shedding and differences in pre-existing immunity between individuals as well as limited sample size. Interestingly, the majority of patients, 7/13 (62%) positive for any agent at the follow-up visit (day 10 \u00b1 2 days) had hRV. Whether this translates into a longer period of infectivity remains to be determined. However, the semi-quantitative estimation of viral loads by Ct values must be interpreted with caution since relative viral loads were not compared to standard amounts of virus.",
