RSV causes a range of illnesses, including croup, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or some combination thereof, and is associated with such complications as progressive pulmonary failure, cor pulmonale, and a risk of bacterial superinfection. Some evidence suggests there may be a strong association between severe RSV LRI in infancy and asthma or allergic airways disease in childhood. RSV is discussed thoroughly in Chapter 34.",

Initially described in patients with LRI in the Netherlands,10 hMPV has now been identified in pediatric and adult patients with LRI worldwide. hMPV is in the same subfamily of Paramyxoviruses as RSV and displays the same syncytial formation in cell culture. Although comparative prevalence studies are difficult to evaluate due to differences in sensitivity of detection methods, hMPV certainly appears to cause a significant portion of LRI worldwide. In one prospective 25-year study, hMPV prevalence was 12% in nasopharyngeal samples from patients with LRI, compared with 15% RSV, 10% parainfluenza virus, and 5% influenza virus.11 Infection usually occurs during childhood, causing hMPV seropositivity in up to 52% of 24-month-old infants and 100% of 5-year-old children.12, 13 Like RSV, hMPV has a seasonal pattern, causing its greatest impact in the winter months. Coinfection with hMPV and other respiratory viruses occurs and appears to increase the severity of illness.14\n",

Both types can cause serious, lethal LRI in infants and children.19 The clinical course contrasts with that of RSV and parainfluenza viruses in that fever, malaise, and often myalgia usually develop and rapidly become more severe over 12 to 24 hours (Fig. 33-2\n). Nasal congestion, cough, and subsequent respiratory distress often do not appear until a day or two after the onset of systemic symptoms. Although the mean overall duration of the acute illness (3 to 7 days) is somewhat shorter than with RSV or parainfluenza viruses, the convalescent phase often lasts several weeks, and rapid deterioration as a result of bacterial superinfection can occur at any time in the course. Rarely, patients may develop a rapidly progressive, overwhelming viral pneumonia resulting in death within 2 to 3 days after the initial onset (Fig. 33-3\n). Pandemic influenza has occurred three times in the past century, causing unusually severe, hemorrhagic pneumonia and millions of deaths. The pathogenicity of these pandemics appears related to a lack of neutralizing serum immunity against the pandemic strain, presumably due to antigenic drift of its hemagglutinin antigen.20, 21\n",

Influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans is characterized by fever, severe respiratory symptoms, lymphopenia, and a high risk of death.27 In 2004, at least 44 persons were infected and 32 died; most had direct contact with infected poultry. However, a probable case of person-to-person transmission28 raises fears of an impending pandemic because few humans will have any immunity against this strain. Chemoprophylaxis with the neuraminidase inhibitors appears to have some benefit, but concerns about emerging viral resistance may limit their use. Thus, such preventive measures as vaccine discovery and prospective poultry screening and culling are critical. Unfortunately, only a few countries have developed influenza pandemic plans and even fewer have the economic and social resources to pursue vaccine development and antiviral stockpiling. Perhaps the greatest impact so far has been the financial reality of domestic poultry destruction in those countries hardest hit by this virus.29\n",

Adenovirus types 3 and 7 have been associated with epidemics of LRI.30 Risk factors for severe, potentially lethal disease include immunocompromise, congenital heart disease, and protein-calorie malnutrition. During the acute phase, chest radiographs often reveal extensive consolidation, particularly in perihilar areas (Fig. 33-4\n). These findings, along with a frequent occurrence of high fevers, leukocytosis, and multisystem involvement, can make it difficult to discern such infections from bacterial conditions. Other systemic manifestations that sometimes develop are hepatic dysfunction (including Reye's syndrome31), encephalopathy, coagulopathies, measles-like exanthems, and diarrhea.32\n",

The hallmark of this syndrome, the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, is unexplained severe noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occurring in previously healthy persons. Subsequent studies have implicated at least three different hantaviruses, which are primarily maintained as zoonotic agents in rodent reservoirs.72 As of November 2004, more than 379 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome had been reported from 31 states in the United States, with a case-fatality rate of greater than 50%.73, 74, 75 Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has also been documented in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Few cases have been reported in people 16 years or younger, but the disease spectrum and mortality are similar to those reported in adults.75, 76 The diagnosis can be made by serologic tests, PCR study of frozen tissues, immunochemistry, or paraffin-embedded tissues. No specific therapy has proved efficacious; however, intravenous ribavirin has been suggested based on in vitro data and experience with other hantaviruses.",

In the Tucson Childrens' Respiratory Study,77 10.9% of previously healthy patients with RSV infection were coinfected with another potential pathogen as documented by culture or antigen detection, and the proportion became even greater when serologic results were also extensively used for diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis and outcomes were no different among patients with RSV alone compared with those already coinfected with additional agents. Routine searches for coinfecting agents when a primary pathogen such as RSV is identified are not recommended for otherwise healthy infants and children. Such extensions of a diagnostic workup are best reserved for patients who are known to have significant underlying illnesses or patients whose clinical course is not congruent with that expected for the pathogen detected.",

Exciting advances are now being made in the critical areas of immunopathogenesis, molecular virology, and antiviral therapy. Future discoveries will surely provide even more rational approaches to prevention and treatment, including specifically designed peptide vaccines that can more appropriately recruit specific T-cell populations as allies in long-lasting protection. Other emerging strategies include enhancement of host defenses by cytokine manipulation and novel applications of older concepts, such as specific antibodies for prophylaxis and treatment. There is considerable cause for optimism, in contrast to the state of affairs described by Andrewes more than 4 decades ago, when he suggested that clinicians should perhaps accept these infections as \u201cone of the stimulating risks of being mortal.78\u201d",
