Laboratory tests included a WBC count of 9.8 K/mm3 (neutrophils = 49%, monocytes = 1%, lymphocytes = 47%), and a platelet count of 151 K/mm3 (n = 160\u2013392 K). An ESR, CRP and serum ferritin level were not obtained. Her procalcitonin level was 1.2 mg/ml (n = <0.50 mg/ml). Serum transaminases were minimally elevated and her alkaline phosphatase was normal. On admission, she had otherwise unexplained hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a left lower lobe infiltrate without pleural effusion (Fig. 1\n). She was empirically treated for CAP with ceftriaxone and azithromycin but her fevers continued for four days. During hospitalization her CXR showed progression of her left lower lobe infiltrate to patchy bibasilar infiltrates (Fig. 2\n). Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella sp. titers were negative. Legionella sp. sputum DFA and urinary antigen were also negative. Nasopharyngeal PCR was positive for human metapneumonovirus (hMPV). She slowly improved clinically and was discharged on hospital day #5.",
