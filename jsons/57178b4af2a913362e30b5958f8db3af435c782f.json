Neurol. 521:203-212, 2013 . Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) is a positive, nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA coronavirus belonging to the betacoronaviruses, together with mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Masters, 2006; De Groot et al., 2012) . As the first member of the group of coronaviruses found to invade the central nervous system (CNS), HEV was initially isolated from encephalomyelitic piglet brains in 1960 in Canada by Greig et al. (1962) . Subsequent studies demonstrated that HEV first oronasally infects the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and small intestine and thereafter is delivered retrogradely via peripheral nerves to the central neurons in charge of peristaltic function of the digestive tract, resulting in the so-called vomiting diseases (Andries and Pensaert, 1980) . Early electron microscopic (EM) and virological analysis showed that glial cells were not infected by HEV in primarily cultivated astrocytes (Yagami et al., 1993) or in the brains of infected piglets or mice (Meyvisch and Hoorens, 1978; Yagami et al., 1986) , indicating that neurons are the major target of HEV in the CNS. However, previous in vivo studies concentrated mainly on the later stage of infection, and it is not clearly understood how this virus is replicated within and released from the central neurons.",

Preliminary EM analysis of HEV-infected motor cortices showed that the pyramidal cells remained largely intact at day 4 postinfection (p.i.) and that both the cytoplasmic and the perineuronal architectures maintained their normal morphology. Destructive changes in the infected neurons did not become prominent until day 5 p.i., which was coincident with the recruitment of immune cells to the infected areas. Therefore, the brains collected at day 4 p.i. were used in this experiment to obtain detailed insights into the replication and dissemination of HEV in the CNS.",

Infected rats showed a relatively constant onset of encephalomyelitis, with an average survival of about 6 days. Fatal infection with HEV can be protected against by cutting the proximal segment of the sciatic nerve within 1 hour after inoculation (Hirano et al., 1995) . Moreover, no anterograde propagation of HEV has been found along spinal ascending pathways throughout the periods examined (Bai et al., 2006; unpublished data) . Consistent with the results in the previous experiments, the present study showed that at day 4 p.i. HEV-positive cells were observed in only a certain population of neurons with different sizes in layer V of the primary motor cortex (Fig. 1A,B) . The fluorescence signals for HEV showed a punctate pattern and were located in the cell bodies and the primary dendrites of pyramidal cells (Fig. 1C ). By contrast, less intense staining was also seen in the putative axons (arrows in Fig. 1C ).",

On the other hand, infected astrocytes were not seen, even in the late stage of infection (data not shown). Transsynaptic transfers of HEV were demonstrated undoubtedly in nine pyramidal cells. Although only nine pyramidal cells were counted, the other cells were not included in the analysis not because HEV showed different transfer means in them but because the pre-or postsynaptic invaginations were not very clear because of the sectioning directions or because the virus particles were not located exactly nearby the pre-or postsynaptic invaginations. A shows an infected pyramidal cell, in which virus particles are observed within vesicles in the perikaryal cytoplasm. Near the cell surface, a virus-containing coated vesicle is found attaching to the plasma membrane (arrow; see also the inset for details). This coated vesicle is apparently fusing with the plasma membrane, and there is an opening at the fusion site. Notably, no virus is found in the adjacent neuropils. B shows the primary dendrite of an infected pyramidal cell. Several progeny virions are found extracellularly near the fusion sites, where a layer of coats still remain on the plasma membrane (arrows). The virion labeled by right arrow is enlarged in the inset. No virus is found either in the adjacent axonal terminals or in the surrounding glial processes. C shows extracellular virions in the dilated synaptic clefts, and some of them are trapped in the coated invaginations of the presynaptic membrane (arrows; see also the inset for details). D shows a virion within a coated vesicle (arrow; see also the inset for details) in the axon terminal adjacent to an infected pyramidal cell. E-H: Electron photographs from vehicle controls showing coated structures in the pre-and postsynaptic cytoplasm. E shows a coated invagination (arrow) in the postsynaptic membrane of a pyramidal cell. The bulbous portion of the invagination communicates with the extracellular synaptic cleft via a thin neck (see the inset for details). F shows a coated invagination (arrow) in the presynaptic membrane, which is further enlarged in the inset. G shows a coated vesicle (arrow) in the postsynaptic cytoplasm, which is further enlarged in the inset. H shows coated vesicles (arrows) present in both the pre-and the postsynaptic cytoplasm. The coated vesicle in the presynaptic region is further enlarged in the inset. I-L: HEV in spinal motoneurons. Three infected rats were perfused at day 3 p.i. with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB. Spinal segments at the level of $L5-L6 were dissected and examined by EM. I and K show two a-motoneurons in the ventral horn of spinal cord.

Virus particles without any vesicular structures are found extracellularly in the synaptic cleft. m, Neuronal cell body; t, axonal terminal. In L, coated vesicles (arrowheads) containing virus particles are seen both in the neuronal cytoplasm (m) and in an adjacent axonal terminal (t). In addition, many virions are accumulated in the dilated synaptic clefts, and some of them are seen trapped in the coated invaginations (arrows) of the axonal membrane.

Because of the direct penetration by fusion of herpesviruses, only virus nucleocapsids can gain access to the axoplasm (Dolivo et al., 1978; Marchand and Schwab, 1986; Card et al., 1993) .

This is the case for HEV in the pyramidal cells, insofar as the present study showed that both the entry and the egress of HEV were mediated by coated vesicles, which differs from the large vesicles reported previously in that they are much smaller, bear a fuzzy coat, and usually contain only one virion. Given that coronaviruses depend on assistance from the host cell in virtually all stages of the infection, it seems conceivable that the means used even by the same virus for dissemination may differ within different cell types (Hobman, 1993; Masters, 2006) .",

Many EM investigations have demonstrated the presence of coated vesicular invaginations as a general feature of both the pre-and postsynaptic membranes (Charlton and Gray, 1966; Waxman and Pappas, 1969; Waxman et al., 1980; Spacek and Harris 2004) . Moreover, studies utilizing a variety of tracing mol-ecules have shown significant transsynaptic labeling after intracellular injection, indicating that interneuronal transfer indeed occurs at the synaptic junctions (Grafstein, 1971; Davis and McKinnon 1982; Trojanowski and Schmidt, 1984; Luo and Dessem, 1996) . However, the transsynaptic process is complicated and not easy to study, partially because of the small but complex structure of the synapse and the lacking of effective tracing methods.",

Larger crescent segments (arrows in A,B) bulge into the lumen of the ER cistern by incorporation of the lipid bilayer of the ER into the viral envelope. Short stalks (arrows in B) are found still continuing with the ER membrane. The virus particles in the lumen of the ER cistern are covered with well-defined surface projections (C). D shows virus particles in Golgi and ER areas in the perikaryal cytoplasm of a pyramidal cell. No membranous decorations are present on the outer surface of the virus-containing vesicle near the ER cistern (indicated by f, and enlarged in F). By contrast, the virion in the Golgi area (indicated by g, and enlarged in G) is enclosed within a vesicle with spinule coats on the outer surface. In both cases, a layer of surface projections is seen surrounding the viral envelope beneath the vesicle membrane (F,G). E shows a Golgi apparatus in the primary dendrite of a proximal cell, where viral budding profiles are observed in the lateral rims of the Golgi cisternae, and virus particles are present in the dilated cisternae of the Golgi network. On the trans-side of the Golgi complex, enveloped virions are enclosed within small vesicles (arrows), with small spinule coats on the outer surface.
