The widely used multiplex PCR tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of respiratory viruses in pneumonia. In many studies in children with CAP, respiratory viruses have been detected in 50-70% of the cases. 4 However, many viruses including HBoV1 have been detected at similar or higher rates in asymptomatic controls which has questioned whether these viruses are causative agents of CAP. [21] [22] [23] This concept is debatable, because respiratory viruses may also cause asymptomatic infections which explains the detection of viruses in asymptomatic subjects. 15 Our study has certain limitations. The study was a single center study limiting wider generalization of the observations. Due to economical restrictions, HBoV1 serology was studied only from HBoV1-DNA-positive patients.

Moreover, it was very recently published that when compared with serology, DNA PCR had high clinical sensitivity (100%) but, because of viral persistence, low specificity (76%). 32 An additional limitation is that no virus-bacterial co-infections were analyzed. The strength of our study includes a long recruitment period lasting almost four and half years, reducing the risk of bias regarding viral seasonality, and a high number of CAP patients. In addition, the serologic studies were carried out in a well-established laboratory of HBoV1 virology.

In agreement with many earlier studies we detected HBoV1 in the majority of cases together with other respiratory viruses. Importantly, one fifth of the children with multiple viral detections had acute HBoV1 infection showing that HBoV1 in coinfections is not always just an innocent bystander. With the use of HBoV1 serodiagnosis it has been clearly shown that by 6 years of age all children have been infected with HBoV1. 18 In the original serodiagnosis study of Kantola et al, 59% of 49 HBoV1-DNA-positive children with acute wheezing exhibited IgM antibodies and/or an increase in IgG antibody levels. 9 Don et al 19 found that 12% of 101 children with CAP had serological evidence of acute HBoV1 infection.
