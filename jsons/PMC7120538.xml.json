The distribution patterns of diseases are further investigated by several risk factors including demographic variables, levels of social economic status, environmental factors, genetic variations, exposure-related behaviors, contact patterns, specific niche of the etiologic agent, and modes of transmission [1,2]. In general, descriptive epidemiologic studies present the mortality or incidence rate of an interesting disease by using thematic maps. The best example is John Snow\u2019s cholera map used in 1854 (Figure 10-1). Snow plotted all fatal cholera cases on the map to find that the contaminated pump was located on Broad Street in London, United Kingdom [http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowmap1_1854_lge.htm]. In recent decades, the geographic information system (GIS) has been applied to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, particularly the relationship among agent, host and environment [3, 4]. And it even helped to eliminate cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh [5].\n\n",

The traditional analysis of geographical distribution of disease cases is generally to mark darker colors in a choropleth map1\n1 with the location of cluster cases that can be identified visually. This approach is easily misled\nby the misclassification of symbology2\n2 or by neglecting temporal factors. On the other hand, much progress has been made in spatial techniques, which are frequently used to indicate the extent of \u201cclustering\u201d across a map. The follow-up spatial analysis can determine whether the increase in each epidemiologic measure is localized or general and even where high risk areas are located with statistically significant increases [7]. Furthermore, development of spatial and temporal clustering methods may provide a more integrated picture of the dynamic diffusion of disease cases that could block further transmission more effectively. In other words, the combination of surveillance, spatial techniques, and statistical methods\u2013particularly the methods developed for characterizing the spatial and temporal clustering, can not only improve the surveillance system but can also enhance the effectiveness of the surveillance system to reach public health goals.",

The case numbers of a reported specific disease for a given health outcome in the three most recent time periods (pre-, current, post-) are compared with historical incidence data on the same health outcome from the same three time periods of the preceding 5 years. The results are shown by comparing the ratio of the current case numbers with the historical mean and SD. The historical mean and SD involve the 15 totals of the three time intervals, including the same previously mentioned three periods (the current period plus the preceding one period, and the subsequent one period over the preceding 5 years) as the historical data. For example, if we want to know whether the influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in September of 2008 are unusual or not, the ILI case numbers of August, September and October in each year from 2003 to 2007 need to be added up to obtain a mean or a median for comparison. For an infectious disease with a strong seasonality trend, the seasonally adjusted CUSUM can be applied. That is, the positive one-sided CUSUM where the count of interest is compared with the 5-year mean\u00b1SD for that specific period. Similarly, the disease with strong holiday effect, post-holiday period, or weekend effect as Taiwan\u2019s emergency department syndromic surveillance system [8] all can be adjusted because of closures of most clinics on holidays/ weekends.",

The results showed that the values estimated by using the historical limit method and delta method were close to the true value.

The original idea of CUSUM was to set up a control limit under a steady period. The strength of CUSUM, similar to the exponentially weighted moving average control chart, is to detect small shifts in the process mean even without historical data for 3\u20135 years. Two important parameters are used in CUSUM. First, an appropriate value for the control limit,h, is based on the average run length (ARL) of the CUSUM, while the failure rate is acceptable within a time interval for quality control that can be regarded as the upper limit of failure rate in quality control or the case number of a studying disease in surveillance.The other parameter is k, which represents the minimum standardized difference from the running mean. The traditional CUSUM chart generally uses the sum of differences both above and below the mean to detect anomalies in either direction. For biosurveillance, an upper sum SH is used to look only for excessive counts in which small differences are ignored and only differences of at least 2k standard deviations above the mean \u00b5t(mean of day/week/other time unit t) are counted. A common practice is to setK at 0.5 to detect a shift of one SD.",

Therefore, newly developed non-historical aberration detection methods can analyze data as short as 1 week. To consider daily variation, the revised CUSUM method, using the measurements from C1, C2 to C3 to increase the sensitivity of the detection based on a positive one-sided CUSUM calculation from a week\u2019s information, was then developed [9]. For C1 and C2, the CUSUM threshold reduces to the mean plus 3 standard deviations (SD). The mean and SD for the C1 are based on the raw data from the past 7 days. The mean and SD for the C2 and C3 are based on the data from 7 days, ignoring the two most recent days to\nminimize the bias. For C1 and C2, the test statistic on day t was calculated as St = max [0, (Xt\u2013((\u03bct + k*\u03c3t))\u2215\u03c3t] where Xt is the count data (number of cases) on day t, k is the shift from the mean to be detected, and (\u03bct and at are the mean and standard deviation of the counts during the baseline t time period. For C1, the baseline period is (t\u20107 to t\u20101); for C2 the baseline is (t\u20109 to t\u20103). The test statistic for C3 is the sum of St+;St\u20101 + St\u20102 from the C2 algorithm. Using these C1, C2 and C3, outbreaks of any infectious disease with a strong seasonal or regular fluctuation trend can be easily detected. This is particularly useful for an agent such as influenza virus, in which different types or subtypes of the virus are dominant each year in addition to continuous antigenic drifts.",

Therefore, researchers could use time series models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) or the Serfling model to predict the possible time and wave of the outbreak. The ARIMA models fit better with time series data that can be applied to better understand the characteristics of epidemiologic data or to predict future time points in a series. The fine-tuning characteristics of ARIMA involve adding lags of the different series and/or considering time lags of the forecast errors to the prediction equation for better prediction of the temporal trend. The Serfling model uses regression by adding sine and cosine two functions to adjust the periodicity. It is frequently used in the excess mortality data analysis of influenza or pneumonia and influenza. Using these methods, the training period of the dataset to be selected is very critical. The cyclical pattern of time intervals such as seasons or months or other time units should be represented in the training data. Then, the dynamic pattern would be updated and predicted by the latest data.

In other words, clusters of cases had already started in the Kita-Kyushu industrial area in 2000 before the occurrence of other spatial clusters from 2002 to 2004. Further analysis found that the occurrence of TB in the clusters located in northern Fukuoka Prefecture in 2000 were also significantly higher than those clusters identified in other years. In conclusion, spatial method alone can be used to evaluate the cluster cases in each year whereas spatial-temporal methods can be applied to find out where cluster cases are within a specific time period and their dynamic changes over different time periods and places as well.\n\n\n",

Heterogeneity in the variations of relative risk (RR) in space and time was found to be associated with mosquito factors, including mosquito feeding cycle, host-seeking behavior, and life span of mosquitoes. Particularly, higher RR values were more likely to be identified in the time periods and areas with shorter temporal and spatial distances (Figure 10-5a) and more clear suspected/confirmed dengue clusters were detected in shorter time distances (Figure 10-5b). In addition, confirmed dengue cases showed more clear higher risk (in red color) than suspected dengue cases, illustrating the importance of laboratory diagnosis. The cluster analysis also proved that\nthe probability of observing a dengue case outside of 100 m around the dengue foci, a distance measured to correspond to a statistical threshold, was low. However, this threshold could vary if the case numbers increased with the improved surveillance system. By contrast, Taiwan\u2019s GIS analysis of confirmed dengue cases showed that the relocation diffusion occurred more frequently as the duration of the epidemic wave in that epidemic site became longer [33]. In other words, spatial limit of transmission, expanding distribution of mosquito vectors even after control efforts, and dynamic changes in populations at risk (e.g., susceptible) can be obtained more precisely once integrated temporal and spatial data are simultaneously analyzed. The situation might be even more complicated for malaria, which involves\ndifferent species of mosquitoes and their variations in ecology [34], and for yellow fever, in which the immunity following vaccination means public health officials need to consider the \u201cpopulation at risk\u201d as well as naturally acquired infection [35].\n\n\n",

Therefore, a GIS web-based platform for the surveillance of rabies named \u201cRabID\u201d was set up to rapidly map the animal rabies cases, to track the rabies reservoir and then to disseminate this information for public education at the US-CDC [36]. Several geographically discrete terrestrial wildlife reservoirs were identified (Figure 10-6a). In addition, real-time and web information on the type of animals infected and associated genotypes and strains of rabies virus identified by monoclonal antibodies have been shared among local animal and public health personnel across various geographical areas. This information will certainly facilitate the timely management of rabies control (Figure 10-6a and b). In other words, GIS information with integrated spatial epidemiologic characteristics is very useful for prevention and control on zoonotic or vector-borne infectious diseases, from public health planning to implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of control.",

Between October 2005 and June 2006, 161 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 occurred in poultry villages of Romania [37]. Using two combined temporal and geostatistical methods, Anselin\u2019s local indicator of spatial autocorrelation statistics (LISA) for area-type data and space-time permutation scan statistic for point-type data, the clusters of H5N1 were identified. The former method focuses only on spatial clusters and the latter method simultaneously considers temporal and spatial clusters. The space-time permutation scan statistic method is particularly useful in infectious diseases with shorter incubation period but closely associated with large-scope ecology and also in those situations where the numbers of populations at risk is unknown in syndromic surveillance [18]. The results found that the locations of the clusters were different by using the two different cluster algorithms (Figure 10-7a and b). The origin, evolution and increasing spread of the epidemic can be grasped more clearly. The outbreak first appeared in the region of the Danube River Delta by the introduction of the virus, implying the importance of landscape epidemiology. Then, the movement of poultry might facilitate its further spread to central Romania the next year. Using the spatio-temporal methods, the progression of the outbreak from a confined, local epidemic extended to a large, nationwide epidemic can be fully understood. Such efforts are very helpful to minimize the spread of the next H5N1 epidemic in other countries and the future global spread of HPAI H5N1 viruses.",

For example, the modes of transmission, the time period that is most communicable, and the spatial patterns of the cases with different social contacts [38]. The subsequent cases after the introduction of prevention and/or control measures can also be carefully evaluated to verify the most effective strategy, using time-based integrated surveillance data. The visualized dynamic distributions of cases in various time periods and places at different levels of the public health system, from local, state/provincial to national and international, can be presented to generate hypotheses and to verify the success of containing the outbreak for decision-makers.

Considering posterior distribution of the space-time interactions into prediction will borrow information over space and time in order to estimate typical predictable patterns for each area. Based on the extension of the Bayesian hierarchical models, the problems in detecting small numbers of events, particularly a small incidence of cases in the early wave of an outbreak, may soon be overcome in the future.",
