Exposure to other infected animals or contaminated fomites is important for agents with direct transmission, such as those inducing respiratory disease (e.g., feline herpesvirus 1, canine bordetellosis) or gastroenteritis (e.g., canine and feline giardiasis, canine and feline parvovirus infection). Potential exposure to vectors (e.g., mosquitoes for dirofilariasis; ticks for Lyme borreliosis [Ixodes spp.], ehrlichiosis [Rhipicephalus sanguineus], Rickettsia rickettsii [Rocky Mountain spotted fever; Dermacentor spp.], and Babesia canis [R. sanguineus]) or appropriate travel history (e.g., coccidioidomycosis in the Southwest; blastomycosis in the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio River valleys) can also suggest infectious disease. Vaccination history, deworming history, and determination of whether other animals or people in the environment are affected can aid in ranking infectious diseases on a differential diagnoses list.",

Endogenous uveitis commonly occurs after infections by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus, toxoplasmosis, and systemic mycoses. Mucopurulent discharges can suggest primary or secondary bacterial infections.

Neutrophilic leukocytosis, particularly if a left shift or degenerative neutrophils (see Chapter 4) are also present, is consistent with an infectious cause of disease. Gram-negative sepsis is suggested by leukopenia with a degenerative left shift. Monocytosis or lymphocytosis can be induced by persistent infection with a number of intracellular agents that result in persistent infection. Examples include ehrlichiosis, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis. Polyclonal (e.g., multiple infectious causes) or monoclonal (e.g., usually induced by neoplasia, rarely associated with canine ehrlichiosis) gammopathies may suggest chronic immune stimulation. Neutrophils in aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synovial fluid, or urine may indicate inflammation induced by infectious agents.",

The primary disadvantage of Gram staining is that Gram-negative bacteria may be difficult to find because background material stains pink. It is easier to find bacteria (dark-blue stain) and easier to study morphologic detail of other cells (i.e., inflammatory cells) using Romanowsky-type stains. Gram staining may be variable; organisms in body fluids may stain differently from those grown on a blood agar plate. Gram stain demonstrates the gram-positive, branching filaments of Actinomyces spp. and Nocardia spp. (see Figure 10-11). Acid-fast stains can be used for Mycobacterium spp. and to help differentiate Nocardia spp. (acid-fast) from Actinomyces spp.",

Both antibody classes can persist in serum for months after exposure. Depending on the assay used, cross-reactivity with B. burgdorferi antigens used in IFA and ELISA can occur with other spirochetes; thus a positive titer does not always document exposure to B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi vaccines induce antibodies that are detected by some IFA and ELISA. Western immunoblot can be used to differentiate vaccine-induced antibodies from antibodies resulting from natural infection. Antibodies against the C6 peptide of B. burgdorferi are rarely induced by vaccination; point-of-care assays using this peptide are commercially available.55 Because B. burgdorferi migrates through the tissues, most dogs with borreliosis are positive for antibodies by the time illness is detected. Healthy dogs develop the same antibody responses as clinically ill dogs, however. Because of these factors, interpretation of positive serum antibody titers is difficult. Serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi only document exposure to B. burgdorferi (or a similar antigen), not clinical disease. An assay to quantify antibodies against the C6 peptide is commercially available (see Appendix I: Select Laboratories for Infectious Disease); however, clinical utility of this assay has not been documented.56\n",

Definitive diagnosis should be based on three factors: (1) histopathologic evidence of tissue invasion, (2) an aspergilloma combined with serologic and culture evidence of infection, or (3) serologic and radiographic evidence of infection (i.e., bone lysis).

DNA of B. canis and B. gibsoni can be amplified by PCR assay, and positive results indicate current infection.6, 17 However, both antibodies and DNA can be detected in dogs that are healthy and those that are clinically ill. Antibody titer magnitude does not correlate to the presence or absence of disease. A titer of greater than 1 : 320 was suggested for B. gibsoni, but not all infected dogs achieve a titer of this magnitude.7 It is important to determine which species are involved in a case because response to treatment varies. Duration of positive titers after resolution of disease is unknown. In untreated experimentally infected dogs, titers remained high for at least 6 months. Untreated, seropositive dogs should be considered carriers of the infection. Treatment is indicated only for seropositive, clinically ill dogs.",

ELISA can be used to measure serum IgM antibodies. CSF antibodies to distemper virus are increased in some dogs subsequently diagnosed histopathologically as having distemper encephalitis. False-positive results can occur in CSF samples contaminated with blood. Concurrent measurement of serum antibody concentrations can be helpful; if CSF concentrations are greater than serum concentrations, the antibody in CSF had to be produced locally and suggests CNS distemper. Detection of serum IgG antibodies is of minimal diagnostic value because a positive titer could develop secondary to vaccination or previous exposure. A fourfold increase in serum IgG titer over a 3- to 4-week period suggests recent infection. Detection of circulating IgM antibodies is consistent with recent infection but not clinical disease. A point-of-care assay for detection of canine distemper antibodies is available. Vaccinated dogs that are seropositive in this assay probably do not need to be boosted. A presumptive diagnosis of distemper encephalitis can be made with increased CSF protein and leukocytes (lymphocytes predominating) plus a positive CSF antibody titer in a sample not contaminated with peripheral blood. Definitive diagnosis of canine distemper infection requires demonstration of viral inclusions by cytologic examination (see Figure 15-3A and B), direct fluorescent antibody staining of cytologic or histopathologic specimens, histopathologic evaluation, or reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) documentation of distemper viral RNA in peripheral blood, CSF, or conjunctival scrapings. (Table 15-1; See Appendix I: Select Laboratories for Infectious Disease.) Positive RT-PCR test results can be induced by modified live vaccination. Viral inclusions can rarely be found in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and leukocyte precursors of infected dogs. Inclusions are generally present for only 2 to 9 days after infection and therefore often are not present when clinical signs occur. Inclusions may be easier to find in smears made from buffy coats or bone marrow aspirates than those made from peripheral blood. Viral particles can be detected by immunofluorescence in cells from the tonsils, respiratory tree, urinary tract, conjunctival scrapings, and CSF for 5 to 21 days after infection.",

In dogs, D. immitis antigen tests may be positive as early as 5 to 6 months and are usually positive 6 to 7 months after infection. False-negative results usually occur in early stages of infection and may occur in single-sex infections (male only) or in dogs or cats with low worm burdens (<3 to 5 worms). Retesting in 2 to 3 months should be performed to detect dogs in which results were negative in early stages of infection. After successful adulticide treatment, test results become negative in approximately 12 weeks. In experimental infections, cats testing positive did so about 8 months after infection. However, single-sex or low worm burden infections can lead to false-negative results. Therefore a positive antigen test result is specific for infection, but a negative result does not rule out dirofilariasis. In cats, the combination of serum antigen test results with serum antibody test results is more sensitive than performing either test alone (see Heartworm Antibody Titer, next).74\n",
