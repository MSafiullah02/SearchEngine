Such that, international foundations as WHO, OECD and EU publish public declaration about necessity of an international central surveillance system. Each data source and contagious disease carries its own patterns. Therefore, standardizing the process of outbreak detection cannot be applicable. Various methods have been analyzed and published on test results in biosurveillance researches. In general, these methods are the algorithms in literature of SPC and Machine Learning, although specific algorithms have been proposed like Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) methods. Differences between published results show that, the characteristic of time series are tested with algorithm and the chosen parameters of this algorithm are also determine results. Our tool provides preprocessing of data; testing, analyzing and reporting on anomaly detection algorithms specialized at biosurveillance. These functionalities make it possible to use outputs for comparing algorithms and decision making.",

Nowadays, the surveillance systems are specialized as the early warning systems which are being used for outbreak detection of time series provided from diagnostic or prediagnostic data [2] . Not only surveillance systems should be limited in use of bio-terrorist attacks, but also should address the natural outbreaks in order to reduce the number of deaths and prevent the financial losses. An idealized surveillance system consists of three stages. First stage is data collection phase. Second stage is, detecting outbreak from dataset provided by first stage. Warning the authorities about the outbreak possibility is the last step of the system. Outbreak detection phase should have adequate performance and this expectation relies on data collection stage's organization quality. The data collected asynchronously causes unreliable results.",

For this purpose, prediagnostic data such as increases in drug sales, number of absenteeism or tendencies of searches on the internet by regions could be inputs for the detection of outbreak [3] . Common patient pattern may consist of three steps in general; internet searching, treatment with the available drugs and visiting hospital lastly. Prediagnostic data might make more sense for this estimation. The datasets used in the outbreak detection contain patterns which lead to different statistics over time [4] . The occurrence of a surging on the surveillance between the weekdays and weekend can be an obvious sample to this. Considering the outpatient services does not work on weekends, visitors to the hospital earlier in the week and so the number of cases may increase cumulatively. Goldenberg observed that drug sales increases at weekends [5] . Therefore, the time series even recorded for the same purpose may lead to significant differences on what conditions are covered. Holidays and holiday returns could be a similar effect as the day of the week [6] . The complexity of surveillance data became more prominent when considering the foresight of seasonal effects and the changes in the air temperature [3] .",

An additive model assumes that, the difference between the Monday and Saturday values is approximately the same each week for daily data. A component of a multiplicative model causes a pattern with equal ratio in time series under the same conditions. To give an example, if observation count of each Monday is 10 greater than Sunday of the same week, it means additive model exists, but if observation count each Monday is greater than Sunday of the same week 3/2 times, it means multiplicative model exists.",

Starting and ending of the outbreaks are not same as anomalies which defined for other contexts. In general, definition of sensitivity is the proportion of conditional anomalies which signed as anomaly for it. But if the anomaly is an outbreak, then conditional anomaly is duration instead of observation. For example, consider an outbreak lasts 10 sequential days and it is detected only for 7th day of outbreak duration. Sensitivity would be measured 0,1 as usual way, but 1,0 for the context of biosurveillance. For this case, timeliness will be valuable metric to handle delay. Specificity is the proportion of conditional negatives which signed as negative for it. In other words, it is the probability that an outbreak test will correctly indicates that an individual does not have a particular condition. Evaluation of the algorithms given previous section is based on sensitivity, specificity and timeliness metrics. The performance of each algorithm was also evaluated bycomparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve (AUC).",
