            "text": "Improving the legibility of Electronic Health Record (EHR) can contribute to patients\u2019 right to be informed about their health and health care. The requirement to ensure that patients can understand their own privacy-sensitive, official health information in their EHR are stipulated by policies and laws. For example, the Declaration on the Promotion of Patients\u2019 Rights in Europe by World Health Organization (WHO) from 1994 obligates health care workers to communicate in a way appropriate to each patient\u2019s capacity for understanding and give each patient a legible written summary of these care guidelines. This patient education must capture the patient\u2019s health status, condition, diagnosis, and prognosis, together with the proposed and alternative treatment/non-treatment with risks, benefits, and progress. Patients\u2019 better abilities to understand their own EHR empowers them to take part in the related health/care judgment, leading to their increased independence from health care providers, better health/care decisions, and decreased health care costs [11]. Improving patients\u2019 ability to digest this content could mean enriching the EHR-text with hyperlinks to term definitions, paraphrasing, care guidelines, and further supportive information on patient-friendly and reliable websites, and the enabling methods for such reading aids can also release health care workers\u2019 time from EHR-writing to, for example, longer patient-education discussions [14].",

Yet, with rare exception, they have targeted the health care experts\u2019 information needs only [1, 2, 6]. Such exception, the CLEF eHealth Evaluation-lab and Lab-workshop Series1 has been organized every year since 2012 as part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) [4, 5, 8\u201310, 13, 16, 17]. In 2012, the inaugural scientific CLEF workshop took place, and from 2013\u20132019 this annual workshop has been supplemented with a lead-up evaluation lab, consisting of, on average, three shared tasks each year (Fig. 1). Although the tasks have been centered around the patients and their families\u2019 needs in accessing and understanding eHealth information, also Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and IE to aid clinicians in IM were considered in 2015\u20132016 and in 2017\u20132019, tasks on technology assisted reviews to support health scientists and health care policymakers\u2019 information access were organized.",

Text has been our major media of interest, but speech has been, and continues to be, included in tasks as a major new way of interacting with systems. Each year of the labs has enabled the identification of difficulties and challenges in IE, IM, and IR which have shaped our tasks. For example, popular IR tasks have considered multilingual, contextualized, and/or spoken queries and query variants. However, further exploration of query construction, aiming at a better understanding of CHS are still needed. The task into the future will also further explore relevance dimensions, and work toward a better assessment of readability and reliability, as well as methods to take these dimensions into consideration. As lab organizers, our purpose is to increase the impact and the value of the resources, methods and the community built by CLEF eHealth. Examining the quality and stability of the lab contributions will help the CLEF eHealth series to better understand where it should be improved and how.
