All these reports support the urgent need for a more stringent PAP after haploidentical transplant in order to reduce the occurrence of IFI and of IFI\u2010related mortality that can be as high as 33%.9 In addition, epidemiologic studies on fungal infection and prophylaxis in the last years have shown a shift from Candida (that remains the second major cause, comprising albicans and non\u2010albicans) to Aspergillus species as the most frequent agents responsible for IFI after Allo\u2010SCT.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

All patients underwent microbiological surveillance, including cultures from stool and urine and swabs from the anal area, starting before the conditioning and then weekly until discharge. In case of fever (defined when the temperature was >38\u00b0C), the following examinations were performed: duplicate blood cultures; high\u2010resolution thorax CT scan (HR\u2010CT); and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) when possible in case of any type of lung abnormality suspicious for infection. Microbiological investigations included microscopy and culture. On direct microscopy, samples were examined by preparing wet mount Gram stain to detect the presence of yeast cells, yeast with pseudohyphae, or septate hyphae for the mold. The samples for fungal culture were inoculated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and incubated at 35\u00b0C. Yeast was further identified by MALDI TOF. The molds were identified using lactophenol cotton blue mount and slide culture. The samples were also investigated by culture for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptocooccus pneumoniae and pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catharralis, galactomannan (threshold for positivity:>1 optical density), Pneumocistis jroveci (immunohistochemistry and PCR), CMV, and respiratory virus (H1N1, parainfluenza, influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus).

Secondary endpoints were long\u2010term outcome parameters such as overall survival (OS) and non\u2010relapse mortality (NRM). Categorical variables were expressed as proportions and continuous variables as medians with the respective range. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD was estimated considering death not related to aGVHD within a year post\u2010transplant as a competing event. cGVHD was estimated only for patients alive at day +100, considering death not related to cGVHD within 2 years post\u2010transplant as a competing event.18 For the calculation of NRM, disease relapse or progression was treated as a competing event, whereas NRM was the competing event for the calculation of cumulative incidence of relapse or progression. The Kaplan\u2010Meier method was used for the OS and progression\u2010free survival (PFS) analyses.19 Outcomes (and respective 95% confidence interval (CI)) were calculated from the date of transplantation. Comparisons between groups were made by log\u2010rank and Gray tests whenever indicated. The cumulative incidence of PPP\u2010 and PP\u2010IFI up to day 100 was estimated considering death for any other reason not related to IFI infection as a competing event. Univariate Cox regression models20 were used to identify significant moderators (independent covariates) on the occurrence of PP\u2010IFI. IFI was treated as a time\u2010varying explanatory covariate to account for its effect on OS and NRM. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.

Ciurea et al described22 that the risk of IFI was 5.6 times higher after TCD transplant compared with T\u2010cell\u2013replete Haplo\u2010SCT with PT\u2010Cy due to delayed immune reconstitution. The Beijing group, which utilized the GIAC platform for haploidentical\u2010SCT, found a cumulative incidence of IFI of 8.25% at 40 days and 13.1% at 1 year after SCT.23 Di Bartolomeo et al,24 who used a similar platform by adding basiliximab to the already intensified immunosuppressive regimen, described a higher incidence of IFI, 12.5% in the early phase followed by 7% in the late one. In the Baltimore platform, cumulative incidence of PP\u2010IFI varies between 8% and 16%.25 In the retrospective study by Raiola et al26 where fluconazole was used as PAP, 16% of Haplo\u2010SCT recipients experienced PP\u2010IFI, with Aspergillus as the most frequent agent followed by Candida non\u2010albicans and Fusarium species. In another report from the same group, where most of the patients received fluconazole and a minority caspofungin followed by itraconazole, cumulative incidence of PP\u2010IFI was 8%.27 In a recent experience, we reported that micafungin prophylaxis yielded a cumulative incidence of PP\u2010IFI of 12%.28 The present study compares well with all mentioned reports of IFI in recipients of Haplo\u2010SCT with PT\u2010Cy. 100\u2010day cumulative incidence of IFI of 8.7% stands in the lower range of IFI documented using the Baltimore platform, even if it is not possible to compare the present results with previous studies due to the great variability of conditioning regimen, disease type, and pre\u2010transplant disease status. It is important to point out that no patients died because of IFI in our cohort of patients. This result is quiet similar to the reports by Raiola et al,26, 27 but very different from the Beijing experience where 3\u2010year OS of patients with IFI was 24% vs 71% for patients without IFI.23 Whether these differences may be due to different GVHD prophylaxis regimens, with the one from Beijing being more intensified, or to the different hospital microbiological flora is difficult to interpret.",

This is mainly due to the lack of head\u2010to\u2010head randomized clinical trial that directly compares more than 2 different drug options in Allo\u2010SCT patients. The recent identification of risk factors for IFI and the following distinction of Allo\u2010SCT into low\u2010/standard\u2010 vs high\u2010risk categories make the results of previous randomized studies even more outdated because they are not enough powered to detect differences in drugs\u2019 efficacy according to the IFI risk. A recent meta\u2010analysis of five randomized studies has shown that relative to fluconazole, PAP with itraconazole or voriconazole or posaconazole reduced the incidence of PP\u2010IFI, whereas posaconazole and voriconazole seemed superior to oral itraconazole in order to reduce the incidence of invasive aspergillosis.29 In details, cumulative incidence of PP\u2010IFI was very low in these phase 3 studies, ranging between 1% and 5%. Of note, these studies included only patients receiving a matched related or matched unrelated donor; therefore, it is not well known the efficacy of voriconazole and posaconazole in the Haplo\u2010SCT setting. In accordance with these findings, most recent updates of ECIL,11, 13 GITMO,12 German, and Australian guidelines30, 31 consistently proposed fluconazole as PAP for low\u2010/standard\u2010risk transplant and an anti\u2010mold agent of choice between posaconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole for subjects at high risk. Caspofungin received a C level of recommendation by the Australian guidelines and a lack of data by ECIL\u2010511 and by the last ECIL recommendations.13 In this context, our study is the first report in adults providing evidence for efficacy of caspofungin at preventing IFI in Haplo\u2010SCT with PT\u2010CY that are at high risk of mold infections. One recent study in pediatric patients has compared amphotericin B (L\u2010AmB) with caspofungin as PAP after Allo\u2010SCT.32 In this study, caspofungin resulted in an excellent protection against IFI with only 1 out of 60 patients developing PP\u2010IFI. Another important observation of this study, besides similar efficacy of the two compounds, was the superior safety profile of caspofungin relative to L\u2010AmB. Consistently, we did not observe either kidney of liver toxicity and interaction with cyclosporine was very low, therefore avoiding the need for frequent cyclosporine dose adjustment as expected with fluconazole (data not shown). Therefore relative to other available antifungal agents, caspofungin provides both some advantages and disadvantages: It is probably more effective than fluconazole against mold infections and has less interactions with other drugs, but it is more expensive; relative to posaconazole and voriconazole, it is not clear whether it provides the same level of protection against mold infections, but it is less expensive and has a safer profile in terms of organ toxicity and drug interactions.",

In our study, we have found by univariate analysis a direct correlation between risk of IFI and increasing number of days of neutropenia, but this was not confirmed by multivariate analysis where advanced DRI came out as the only variable affecting the probability of developing IFI. However, this result should be read with caution due to the relative low number of PP\u2010IFI (n = 8) events in our cohort.",

The fact that most patients received RIC or NMA transplant may have resulted in reduced incidence of PP\u2010IFI. Of note, we did not observe any increased incidence of PP\u2010IFI in the subgroup receiving MAC transplant (data not shown). Moreover, we restricted our analysis only to the first 100 days after transplant that may have induced us to lose a small part of events. We decided to do so because many factors other than antifungal prophylaxis, such as acute and chronic GVHD, are known to play a predominant role in the occurrence of IFI after day +100.7 Moreover, recent evidences such as the ones from GITMO showed that most PP\u2010IFI (76%) occurred in the first 100 days after allo\u2010SCT. Another limitation of this study concerns the comparison with itraconazole prophylaxis. Unfortunately, even if we observed a trend for reduced PP\u2010IFI in the cohort receiving caspofungin, no definitive conclusion can be taken probably because of the different characteristics of the 2 groups (patients with caspofungin had more adverse pre\u2010transplant features). Moreover, data on blood concentration of itraconazole are not available, even if all patients received iv itraconazole, thus reducing the risk of low blood levels as frequently observed with the oral formulation.",
