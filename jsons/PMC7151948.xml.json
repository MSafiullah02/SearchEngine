Ranging throughout western North America from northern Mexico to southern Canada, pronghorn are found in open areas of prairies and deserts, eating primarily forbs, browse, and grasses. The Sonoran and Peninsular subspecies are considered Endangered according to federal classification. Although extremely fast runners, they are not agile jumpers, and local populations have been fragmented by fencing.57 They are extremely fractious, are prone to stress hyperthermia, and may be difficult to maintain in captivity.10 Pronghorns are fall breeders, producing twins in spring, and are the only known ungulates to exhibit multiple paternity.7\n",

Ever-increasing human populations and their livestock encroaching on natural habitats, agriculture, transportation infrastructure, and fencing are some of the factors causing disruption of habitat and migration and are decreasing population size and genetic diversity across the taxon. In captivity, a loss of nearly 1000 spaces for antelope between 1999 and 2011 and a predicted decline in future space are reported by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Antelope Taxon Advisory Group.2 Of the 82 species of ungulates in AZA collections, 42% are in decline or have a negative growth rate. Few sustainable bovid populations\u2014those that are able to persist indefinitely without supplementation\u2014exist, either in the wild or in captivity. Over 25% of antelope species are threatened by extinction, three exist in populations of fewer than 500 individuals, and many are not represented by captive populations, all of which increases the risk of extinction.34 Recent recommendations to manage antelope in larger, less intensively managed groups have been based on (1) the difficulty of maintaining genetic diversity in small, isolated captive populations; (2) the risk of transporting animals for breeding purposes; (3) advanced methodology in genetics and population modeling; and (4) the relative success of large-landscape game ranches in population management.34, 57\n",

If a calf cannot be raised by its dam, hand rearing is labor intensive and requires early intervention to provide the calf with the best chance of survival. Neonatal ruminants acquire immune protection passively through ingestion of maternal colostral immunoglobulins (IgG) in the first 24 to 48 hours of life. The calf's ability to absorb antibodies ends approximately 24 hours after the first meal,15 and failure of passive transfer (FPT) occurs when inadequate levels of IgG are absorbed during this period. Even calves nursing from their dams may experience FPT by ingesting colostrum in inadequate volume or low IgG content, and FPT calves are highly susceptible to disease, often into the postweaning period. The prophylactic use of parenteral antimicrobials in calves with FPT should be considered but must be combined with colostrum replacement and management practices that minimize pathogen exposure. The first choice for colostrum replacement should be oral administration of fresh or frozen intraspecific colostrum, followed by low-temperature pasteurized cow's colostrum, commercial freeze-dried cow's colostrum replacer, and commercial bovine plasma. Feed calves 10% of their body weight in colostrum, or 5 grams per kilogram (g/kg) colostrum replacer, over the first 24 to 48 hours. Tests for FPT are readily available.56 If passive transfer is inadequate after 48 hours, calves may receive parenteral conspecific plasma or commercial bovine plasma (20\u201340 milliliters per kilogram [mL/kg]).",

Milk deposited into the nonfunctional rumenoreticulum during this period is not digested and may lead to rumenitis and septicemia.15 For this reason, tube feeding or force feeding a calf with a poor suckle response may be harmful. Closure of the esophageal groove is stimulated by suckling and normally prevents this deposition. If tube feeding is necessary in the first weeks of life, a tube passed to the mid-esophagus may stimulate swallowing and closure of the groove. Additionally, oral administration of 10% sodium bicarbonate or 2% to 5% copper sulfate prior to milk feeding may facilitate groove closure for several minutes. By 2 to 3 weeks, the ruminal papillae are stimulated, and the calf begins to take in small amounts of dry feed.

Cattle are grazing species, but many of the nondomestic Bovidae are intermediate or browse feeders. Browsers are adapted to eating the leaves and twigs of woody plants, intermediate feeders to both browse and grasses, and grazers to consuming grasses (see Table 63-1). All of these forages are fermented by the microbes of the ruminoreticulum, which produce fatty acids, providing energy to the ruminant. The grazer rumen is adapted for fermenting the high cellulose content in grasses through prolonged fermentation and particle retention, compared with the smaller, less muscular browser rumen. Consequently, browsers tend to eat less hay and are often fed higher amounts of pelleted concentrate to compensate for low hay consumption. High levels of easily digested carbohydrates such as starch and sugar, often found in pelleted concentrates, are too rapidly fermented in the rumen, leading to rumen acidosis. The ideal rumen pH range is 6.7 \u00b1 0.5, and variation from this results in disturbance of the microflora. Altered and depleted rumen flora decrease the energy delivered to the ruminant, which results in weight loss. In response, many of these animals will receive increased amounts of concentrate, which compounds the problem. Rumen acidosis and resulting rumenitis may also lead to systemic acidosis, mineral imbalances, and laminitis or abnormal hoof growth.",

Restraint should be initiated on an isolated animal in a darkened, quiet, obstacle-free enclosure that is small enough to minimize the risk of injury to the animal but large enough to allow free movement and escape of the handlers. A stall with padded walls and hay or straw floor substrate is optimal for animal safety. A minimum of two handlers should perform the capture, depending on the size and temperament of the animal, and the handlers should wear protective clothing, footwear, eyewear and gloves. Hand restraint in bovids under 5 kg may be accomplished by a single handler by quickly lifting the animal, supporting the abdomen and spine against the handler's body, and restraining the head and legs. Restraint of medium-sized animals may be initiated by catching the head and quickly pushing the animal against a wall, pad, or floor with head restraint and placing a knee under the flank, with a second handler restraining the rear legs. Horns may be used for restraint of most species, but young animals or those with thin horns may be prone to horn avulsion. The head and legs should be tightly restrained to prevent the use of horns and hooves, and placement of a hand or a pad between the hocks may help to prevent self-trauma. The duration of physical restraint should be minimized to prevent distress and hyperthermia, and a clear airway and adequate chest excursion should be ensured at all times. Use of a blindfold may reduce struggling. If an animal is to be restrained repeatedly, short pieces of hosing placed on the horn tips improves safety for the handlers. Release should be coordinated such that handlers act quickly and in concert, directing the animal toward a clear path and to an open area that provides the patient with a sense of refuge and minimizes the risk of injury.",

In designing a restraint, considerations such as maneuvering animals from a pen into the chute, the ability to stop and sort animals within the system, the inclusion of movable rear walls for pushing resistant animals, the presence of a scale within the system, and multiple exit routes may be critical to creating a process that is efficient and safe, minimizing time and stress to the animals.

Most of the longer-acting formulations have an onset of action of 1 to 3 days, necessitating the addition of short-acting neuroleptics to produce immediate and long-term tranquilization. Table 63-3\nlists common formulations and their onset and duration of action, and Table 63-4\nlists suggested doses of neuroleptic drugs for tranquilization of pronghorns and bovids. Recommended dosages per kilogram of body weight are inversely proportional to body size. It should be noted that neuroleptic use may improve the ease of captive management of smaller hoof stock by increasing flight distance, but reducing the fear response may have the opposite effect in larger, more aggressive species, resulting in reduced avoidance behavior, reluctance to move, and aggression. Overdosing is known to produce behavioral side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, including abnormal facial and tongue posture, head pressing and other unusual movement patterns, and anorexia. Treatment of clinical signs of overdosing may be accomplished using low doses of xylazine, diazepam, or diphenhydramine.44\n",

Intravenous administration may be performed on manually or mechanically restrained animals and provides the advantage of decreased induction and recovery time. However, in larger animals, intravenous administration of a mechanically restrained animal may result in difficulty in removing the rapidly-induced animal from the restraint device. In general, intramuscular induction of an animal with an appropriate regimen in a darkened, quiet enclosure provides a relatively rapid and smooth induction and may minimize the need for anesthetic supplementation because of longer duration of action. Administration of anesthetics intramuscularly (IM) may be conducted by hand, pole syringe, or projectile dart. The use of darts and remote injection systems has been previously reviewed27 and requires careful planning and experience. Planning an anesthetic event should include considerations such as environmental temperatures, approach, enclosure size, obstacles, and the presence of other animals. Failure to deliver an appropriate dose accurately and quickly to an animal in the wild or in a large enclosure may result in excessive running or pacing injury, capture stress or myopathy, and death. Muscle masses of the rump, shoulder, and neck are preferred sites of remote injection. Failure of induction within an appropriate time (usually 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the regimen) may be caused by many factors, including dart failure, inappropriate dosing, and operator error. A partially anesthetized animal is susceptible to capture myopathy, so a decision to repeat induction should be made within 20 minutes of initial dart placement. Supplementation by remote means generally requires a full anesthetic dose, as the animal may be rapidly metabolizing the anesthetic because of stress and activity.",

The use of the mixed opioid agonist\u2013antagonist butorphanol tartrate as a component of anesthetic cocktails has been recently reviewed.6 Historically, the ultrapotent opioid (narcotic) agents carfentanil citrate, etorphine, and thiafentanil oxalate have been the primary components of anesthetic cocktails used in nondomestic bovid species for many reasons: (1) Opioid agents have a relatively wide margin of safety for the patient and are highly potent, allowing for small volumes to be contained in remote delivery darts; (2) they are rapid acting and provide an efficient induction and minimize the risk of hyperthermia; and (3) they are reversible. However, ultrapotent opioids are associated with significant side effects such as suppression of respiration and GI motility, poor muscle relaxation, and renarcotization46 and carry a risk to human safety, as the lethal human dose of some agents is as low as 20 micrograms (\u00b5g).29 Ultrapotent opioids are Schedule II substances controlled by the Drug Enforcement Agency and thereby require the practitioner to possess special licensing and to follow defined possession, storage, and recordkeeping guidelines. Safety protocols and special training for handling narcotics and exposure emergencies must be maintained for all staff involved in ultrapotent narcotic procedures. Carfentanil citrate is the most potent of the three agents. Etorphine and thiafentanil oxalate may produce desirable effects such as improved muscle relaxation and decreased respiratory suppression in some species. Opioids, particularly carfentanil, may produce general anesthesia when administered alone; however, combination with other agents may reduce the narcotic dose, ease induction and recovery, increase muscle relaxation, and decrease respiratory suppression.",

Measures should be taken during any anesthetic procedure to prevent, identify, and treat hyperthermia, capture myopathy, metabolic derangements, respiratory depression, tympany, circulatory compromise, and regurgitation. Regurgitation is a common reaction to anesthetics and is complicated by positioning and anesthetic-induced ileus and tympany. Consequently, aspiration pneumonia is a significant risk in the unintubated ruminant. Intubation may be performed in most species by using a laryngoscope and a flexible stylet.3, 10 The patient should be at an adequate plane of anesthesia prior to intubation to prevent swallowing and stimulation of regurgitation.3 Once intubated, the animal should be maintained in ventral or right lateral recumbency to minimize gastric pressure and ease ventilation. The head should be supported, with the nose down to allow regurgitated material to flow from the mouth. Adequate padding should be ensured, especially in heavy-bodied animals, to prevent pressure neuropathy of the limbs. Eye covers and ear plugs are recommended to minimize stimulation during anesthesia.",

Currently, 10 viruses have been recognized within the MCF group, six of which are clearly associated with clinical disease.32 The two most well-documented viruses, sheep-associated (SA-MCF) and wildebeest-associated MCF (WA-MCF), are caused by ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1), respectively. Both viruses are carried asymptomatically in the reservoir host species (after which they are named), are pathogenic to other species, and are shed through ocular and oronasal secretions. WA-MCF is generally transmitted by calves from birth up to 4 months of age, but lambs are generally not infected with OvHV-1 until after 2 months of age and shed the pathogen intensively from 6 to 9 months of age. Lambs may, therefore, be separated from dams and raised virus-free.32 Other described MCF viruses include hippotragine (HipHV-1) and alcelaphine 2 (AlHV-2) MCF, isolated from roan antelopes and hartebeests, respectively, but the epidemiology of these viruses remains poorly understood. Oryxes, ibexes, muskoxen, and aoudads are also known to harbor MCF viruses of unknown pathogenicity. Species susceptible to disease caused by MCF viruses include cattle, bison, deer, and pigs, but sporadic cases of MCF or MCF-like disease in a variety of captive nondomestic bovids have been reported.22, 32 Susceptible hosts may be subclinically or clinically affected. Bison are known to be 1000 times more susceptible, compared with cattle, to clinical SA-MCF,32 and bongos have been recently reported to acquire fatal MCF from Nubian ibexes.22, 32 The clinical presentation of MCF is variable but usually includes profuse nasal and ocular discharge, corneal opacity, diarrhea, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, anorexia, and often death within 24 to 72 hours. Pathologic findings include lymphoproliferative vasculitis and epithelial necrosis. Identification of clinically relevant reservoir species is complicated by the incomplete characterization of these complex and evolving viruses: serologic tests distinguishing OvHV-2 and AlHV-1, however, are available. In the face of a suspected outbreak in a mixed-species situation, a multiplex PCR is the first choice diagnostic.32\n",

Nonpharmaceutical strategies for reducing parasite burdens, which are reviewed thoroughly elsewhere,20, 45, 50 include decreasing stocking density, pasture rotation, elevating feed and browse, feeding tannin-containing plants such as sericia lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) and nematode-trapping fungi,50 and providing refugia (untreated nonclinical animals) for susceptible parasites to dilute the frequency of resistant alleles.52 The use of oral copper oxide wire particles (COWP; Copasure, Butler Schein Animal Health, Dublin, OH) is increasing in zoologic institutions with some success.20 Although dosing for nondomestic artiodactyls has not been thoroughly investigated, the manufacturer's recommended dose of COWP for cattle (70\u2013225 kg) is 12.5 g, and 2 to 6 grams per animal has been reported efficacious and without toxicity in sheep and goats.50 COWP may be administered in capsules or feed, are effective against abomasal parasites only, and should be limited to no more than every 6 to 12 month usage, with careful monitoring of fecal parasite levels and attention to potential toxicity.

            "text": "Capture myopathy was first described decades ago and remains a significant concern in pronghorns and bovids under all conditions of management.42, 54 The syndrome is most often associated with prolonged pursuit, capture, restraint, transportation, and high ambient temperatures, although many other stress-inducing factors may precipitate its development. Capture myopathy is most commonly characterized by ataxia, metabolic acidosis, muscle necrosis, and myoglobinuria; however, several closely related syndromes have been described (Table 63-12\n). In general, the pathophysiology of the disease includes exhaustion of muscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (skeletal and cardiac), decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased production of lactic acid leading to muscle necrosis, myoglobin release, and renal failure. Predisposing factors include species (reported to be common in pronghorn, nyala, tsessebe, duiker, roan, hartebeest, eland, springbok, kudu, and impala17); environment (high temperature and humidity); capture or restraint; underlying conditions (pregnancy, advanced age); and vitamin E or selenium deficiency. By the time signs of capture myopathy are obvious, treatment is generally unrewarding. Prevention consists primarily of careful restraint planning and includes limiting pursuit to less than 3 minutes; avoiding capture in ambient temperatures over 20\u00b0 C; reducing visual and auditory stimulation during restraint; minimizing restraint time; and using sedation and general anesthesia, when warranted. If, despite careful planning, an animal becomes highly stressed, hyperthermic, or hypoxemic during capture, treatment may be successfully provided to prevent fatal myopathy. Aggressive fluid therapy and treatment of metabolic acidosis should be initiated as early as possible. Point-of-care analyzers are helpful in evaluating acid\u2013base and electrolyte disturbances and guiding treatment. Sodium bicarbonate administration may be given as a bolus (1\u20132 milliequivalents per kilogram [mEq/kg]) and re-administered, as indicated by blood gas analysis. In a normal animal, lactate should be less than 2 mmol/L; a lactate value greater than 5 to 6 mmol/L carries a poor prognosis.30 Administration of corticosteroids, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 10% in intravenous fluids), or a combination of both may be preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the control of inflammation because of the likelihood of renal compromise with NSAIDs and may also protect vascular integrity. Following initial treatment, patients should be kept in a cool, quiet area and monitored closely for adequate renal output (1 mL/kg/hr)30 for several days.",

In general, estrus synchronization protocols must be developed through research on each species. To date, estrus synchronization and artificial insemination using frozen-thawed semen have been successful in the eland, banteng, gaur, addax, scimitar-horned oryx, suni, blackbuck, Speke gazelle, Mhorr gazelle, and springbok.39, 43\n",

Supportive treatment for neonatal septicemia should include provision of a clean, warm, lowly lit environment; soft, clean bedding; intravenous fluid supplementation; and plasma transfusion, colostrum supplementation, or milk-based nutritional support, depending on the age and condition of the neonate. Bedding should be changed frequently as septicemic neonates are usually too weak to stand and therefore susceptible to urine scald and corneal irritation or ulceration.",
