Concurrently, CoV infected patients administered with protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown improved outcome,1, 13 demonstrating the potential of the main protease (Mpro) as the most promising drug target in CoVs14, 15 Hence, a recently published X\u2010ray crystal structure of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Mpro provides an excellent ground for structure\u2010based drug discovery efforts.16\n",

Few research groups have already suggested potential repurposing strategies for clinically approved drugs24, 25, 26 or proposed de novo agents27 as therapeutic solutions for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. However, previously reported docking (virtual screening) campaigns with Mpro targets were able to process only few millions or even thousands compounds.6, 28, 29, 30 The main reason for that is that conventional docking is too computationally expensive and slow, while the libraries of available chemicals are growing exponentially.31 To address this general challenge, we have recently developed a novel deep learning\u2010based approach for accelerated screening of large chemical libraries, consisting of billions of entities. This Deep Docking (DD) platform utilizes quantitative structure\u2010activity relationship (QSAR) models trained on docking scores of database subsets to approximate in an iterative manner the docking outcome of the remaining entries. Importantly, DD does not provide any novel scoring function for docking, thus its accuracy relies completely on the docking program that is used. The development of deep learning scoring functions has been already attempted, but results have shown various degrees of success which could be due to a lack of appropriate datasets.32, 33 Likely, as the very nature of docking is approximate, the improvements are likely to come from better approximation of physical\u2010chemical processes, including solvation, enthalpic and entropic factors, rather than from a better training base and procedures.34, 35 Thus, our method represents not just feasible, but also practical options for utilizing deep learning in virtual screening. Herein we have used DD for large\u2010scale virtual screening against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Mpro active site.",

At the end of the 4th iteration, the top 3 million molecules predicted to have favorable scores were then docked to the protease site. The set of protease inhibitors (7,800 compounds) from the BindingDB repository was also docked to the same site.46 Our computational setup consisted of 13 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPUs @ 2.10GHz (a total of 390 cores) for docking, and 40 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB memory for deep learning.",
