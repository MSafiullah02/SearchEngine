Hence most of us have never imagined how a pandemic, such as the present COVID 19 one, could severely jeopardize the possibility of putting our work at the service of society, be it in the realm of forensic pathology, forensic sciences in general or clinical forensic medicine. We have spent years if not decades envisaging catastrophies of quite a different nature, preparing protocols for properly recovering and identifying victims, reconstructing manner of death and collecting evidence in scenarios which span from explosions to tsunamis, from mass disasters, to single cases of voluntary homicide, child abuse, or manslaughter; but today our discipline too seems almost helpless in front of the paralysing effect of a 30-kilobase virus.",

            "text": "The Metropolitan city of Milano with its population of 3 million is the largest in the Region of Lombardy (population 10 million), and Lombardy is the area which has been most severely hit by COVID 19. In less than two months there have been over 62, 000 cases, with over 11, 000 COVID related deaths (1). The Regional Health Service (one of the most efficient in the country from a clinical perspective) quickly reached saturation under such extreme stress, with worrying shortage of beds not only in infectious and respiratory disease wards but especially in intensive care units. At least four new hospital facilities have been developed in the region during this time to meet these needs. Shortage of swabs for COVID 19 RNA testing, saturimeters, protective gear such as gloves, goggles and masks has quickly become critical also, as well as scarcity of healthcare specialists, This is an account of the reality of Milano, which has one of the largest morgue facilities for medicolegal purposes (between 800-1000 cases per year) on the national territory; but an exchange of views with several European colleagues in some cases has confirmed similar experiences elsewhere. In less than 2 months, medico legal autopsies have drastically decreased, by 70% (4). For reasons related to several variables (mainly the fact that the system is generally under pressure, but also to lack of protective equipment in some cases, in other cases inadequacy of forensic autopsy rooms in guaranteeing sufficient negative pressure or other fundamental prerequisites for the safeguard of environmental and operator health) full medicolegal autopsies are not being performed except for extreme circumstances, and frequently with targeted dissection (only to the extent necessary) and percutaneous sampling of fluids, as mentioned in several protocols available from across the world (5, 6). In many cities across Lombardy and Italy, University and hospital morgues had been potentiated in preparation for disasters such as terrorist bombings, in order to accomodate a large number of victims, and for technically complex situations which were to be challenging under the perspective of size (quantity of victims), trauma, taphonomy; therefore, for example, large numbers of cold storage rooms and fridge-cells, as well as radiological facilities were implemented.",

We know from the Prosecutor's Office in the city (7) that criminal proceedings related to traffic and occupational deaths have actually decreased with respect to normality for reasons related to limited work access and mobility; nonetheless cases of suicide and voluntary homicide have not. Therefore this forced reduction in medicolegal activity will somehow affect the justice system.",
