Patients in early stages of disease can have subtle enough abnormalities that differentiating them from healthy animals is difficult; therefore, sensitive methods to identify diseased patients are desirable. This is particularly true in diseases involving inflammation and infection, where early intervention can affect short- and long-term prognosis. In addition, diagnostic modalities that allow for monitoring of treatment response are extremely useful for guiding therapeutics and assessing prognosis.",

A notable negative APP is albumin, with positive APP including fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A (SAA). Serum/plasma levels of positive APP increase in response to a triggering event (eg, infection, trauma) and decrease coinciding with recovery; the magnitude of increase and rate of decline varies between species and the specific APP.3\n",

            "text": "Equine SAA is an apolipoprotein consisting of three isoforms and is complexed primarily to high-density lipoproteins.4, 5, 6 Mainly produced by the liver, extrahepatic secretion of SAA also occurs into colostrum and synovial fluid. SAA is the only major positive APP in the horse. A major APP is defined as one whose concentrations are low or clinically undetectable in normal animals but rapidly increase greater than 10-fold during the APR and rapidly decrease with disease resolution. Relapse or a new/secondary insult result in a return to increased concentrations.4 This contrasts with moderate APPs, such as fibrinogen and haptoglobin in the horse, which are detectable in serum/plasma of healthy animals, have a slower response to stimuli, and increase 1- to 10-fold during the APR. Fibrinogen has remained the mainstay of blood analysis for inflammation in horses and other large animal species, largely because of the ease and minimal expense of testing. However, fibrinogen concentrations do not increase for 24 hours after the inciting inflammatory event and only peak at 48 to 72 hours.7 Additionally, the increase in fibrinogen concentrations is small (usually 1- to 2-fold) making it difficult to reliably detect mild inflammation. In contrast, serum/plasma SAA concentrations increase up to 1000 times as soon as 6 hours after stimulation and, once the stimulus is removed, concentrations decrease within 12 hours because of its short half-life (30\u2013120 minutes).5\n,\n8\n,\n9\n",

Animals with systemic inflammation had significantly higher SAA concentrations (mean, 1583 mg/L; range, 688\u20134000 mg/L) than horses with local or no inflammation (mean of 343 mg/L and range of 37\u20131609, and mean of 5.6 mg/L and range of 1.8\u201314.5 mg/L, respectively). This discrimination was more distinct than that of fibrinogen, where the mean concentrations of the three groups were 224, 181, and 128 mg/dL, respectively.31 For differentiating clinically normal horses from those with infectious or inflammatory disease, SAA measurement had a sensitivity of 53%, specificity of 94%, and diagnostic accuracy of 75%, whereas white blood cell count, plasma fibrinogen concentrations, and albumin/globulin ratios had lower diagnostic accuracy (59%\u201362%).32 In cases where serial SAA measurements were obtained, horses with increasing SAA concentrations between 24 and 72 hours of admission were significantly more likely to develop complications or be euthanized, whereas there was no significant difference in outcome in horses with increased SAA concentrations at admission.25\n",

Foals with noninflammatory abnormalities, such as failure of passive transfer and noninfectious disease, had low SAA concentrations at 5.1 and 3.1 mg/L, respectively.

However, colic cases that are admitted with higher SAA concentrations (\u226520, and typically 60\u20131000 mg/L) should have inflammatory lesions, such as enteritis and colitis, higher on the differential diagnostic list.",

It seems to have limited validity in screening foals for R equi pneumonia, although it often increases to extremely high concentrations in pleuropneumonia in adult horses and is valuable in assessing response to treatment in such cases. SAA also does not reliably distinguish surgical from nonsurgical colic cases and, although it may possibly be oversensitive, serial testing of SAA is likely superior to that of fibrinogen in identifying postoperative infections. Any deviations from a steady fall after the first 2 to 3 days after surgery might prompt a search for infectious complications. Overall, practitioners should feel comfortable using SAA in lieu of fibrinogen (and certainly in preference to complete blood count (CBC), in the authors\u2019 opinion) for most cases where infectious or inflammatory disease is suspected, although measuring both initially may be useful for the practitioner with limited experience in interpreting the wide range of results with this marker.",
