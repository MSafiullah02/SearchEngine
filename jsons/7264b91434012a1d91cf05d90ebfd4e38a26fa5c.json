However, the fact that the mortality rate is high (>30%) and the transmission mechanisms are still not completely understood highlight the need for increased awareness of the potential threat to blood safety by MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus. Interestingly, viral RNA was detected in the sera of asymptomatic patients during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which is caused by another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV. Consequently, there might be an asymptomatic viremic phase that could theoretically lead to transmission via blood transfusion. However, blood transfusions have not been implicated in the transmission of MERS-CoV to date. 5 EBOV, a member of the Filoviridae family, is an enveloped pathogen containing negative-sense single-stranded RNA as its genetic material. EBOV disease is extremely fatal and is known to cause death rates of up to 90%. Recent outbreaks of EBOV disease in West Africa have devastated Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, killing more than 11,000 out of nearly 30,000 persons affected. 6 EBOV is transmitted to humans from animals and spreads through human-to-human transmission, that is, via direct contact with infected blood and/or secretions.",

[8] [9] [10] In contrast to other PI technologies, it works without exogenously added photoactive substances. Shortwave UVC light (254 nm) interacts with nucleic acids directly, inducing the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine and pyrimidine pyrimidone dimers that prevent the elongation of nucleic acid transcripts. 11 The THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (Macopharma) is a photodynamic PI procedure for single units of fresh-frozen plasma. This system, based on the administration of methylene blue (MB) in combination with visible light (MB/light), was developed to increase the viral safety of plasma transfusions. 12, 13 More than 5 million units have been treated by this method and safely transfused to patients for more than 10 years.",

This mechanism of action is broadly effective against extracellular and intracellular transfusion-transmitted DNA/RNA-containing pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. THERAFLEX MB-Plasma combines MB-a phenothiazine compound that intercalates into viral nucleic acid-with visible light. The illumination of MB-treated plasma results in the generation of singlet oxygen, which leads to the destruction of viral nucleic acids and thus prevents viral replication. 12 Because MB only partially penetrates cell membranes, MB/light treatment is less effective against intracellular viruses. This is why two filters are integrated in the process chain. Although the second filter mainly removes MB and its photoactivated products after illumination, both filters have multiple layers of small-meshed membranes capable of removing residual WBCs, RBCs, and PLTs that may carry intracellular pathogens. It was recently shown that the two filters efficiently remove high levels (up to 5.9 log colonyforming units per milliliter) of viable bacteria and bacterial spores. 25 It can be assumed that parasites of similar sizes can also be removed by the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma procedure. A previous investigation showed that the filtration step before the addition of MB and visible light illumination was critical to achieving the complete and reproducible elimination of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. 26 It is estimated that there are more than 1400 known human pathogens, 13% of which are considered emerging or reemerging. 27 The ability to provide proactive protection against emerging infectious agents complementary to the existing blood screening programs is a major additional benefit of PI systems for blood safety. Thus, it is imperative that manufacturers continuously challenge their PI systems with new infectious agents. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the efficacy of UVC and MB/light against MERS-CoV and EBOV or any other member of the Coronaviridae and Filoviridae families. Our results showed that these two PI systems reduced MERS-CoV and EBOV titers to below the limit of detection in the two blood units tested.",

As in a previous study, the observed reduction of EBOV titers and MERS-CoV titers in the present study was beyond the expected dilution factor in PCs and plasma. 28 This phenomenon may occur due to the presence of nonspecific immune mediators that neutralize viruses in plasma. 28, 29 The mean log reduction factors of at least 3.7 (MERS-CoV) and at least 4.5 (EBOV) in PCs treated with UVC and of at least 3.3 (MERS-CoV) and at least 4.6 (EBOV) in plasma treated with MB/light suggest that both PI technologies used in this study are considerably effective against these two virus types.",

For example, the number of replicates was limited by safety constraints, as experiments with MERS-CoV and EBOV are subject to the highest biosafety level. In addition, large-volume plating could not be performed, although this would have improved the detection limit and enabled more exact determination of log reduction factors. Although plasma viral RNA loads in MERS-CoV patients may be up to 6 log genome copies/mL, and median viral RNA loads of up to 6.68 log genome copies/mL have been detected in the blood of Ebola patients, 30, 31 virus titers in the plasma of asymptomatic infected or convalescent individuals recruited to donate blood may be significantly lower. As it is known for other infectious diseases, EBOV viral titers expressed in genome copies per milliliter do not necessarily reflect the infectivity titer. While viral titers measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction are based on the detection of a small fragment of the viral genome, infectivity titers describe the number of intact, functional viral units required for replication and disease transmission. Although EBOV is highly infectious and low doses of less than 10 plaque-forming units of the virus are sufficient to cause disease, 32 the ability of the UVC-and MB/ light-based systems to reduce MERS-CoV and EBOV infectivity in blood products by several log steps may be sufficient to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of transmission via the transfusion of PCs or plasma. In conclusion, this study further expands the list of pathogens that THERAFLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma can effectively inactivate in PCs and plasma, respectively. ",
