For instance, they can act as catalytic cores at the active sites of enzymes or as second messengers for a variety of small molecules and receptors, or they can stabilize the tertiary structure of proteins and nucleic acids.2 In particular, metals in biological systems usually exist as electron-deficient cations (Lewis acids) that may interact with electron-rich biomolecules that are \u201cnatural ligands\u201d (Lewis bases) capable of binding metal ions to perform important biological functions. Additionally, a significant number of clinical trials involve nowadays both essential and nonessential metal-based compounds to be used in either therapy or diagnosis, including anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, antineurodegenerative, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.1\n",

The majority of metal nuclei have I\n > 1/2; therefore, contrary to I\n = 1/2 counterparts (having spherical nuclear charge distribution), they show a nonspherical distribution of the nuclear electric charge (i.e., oblate or prolate spheroid). Consequently, in addition to their magnetic moment, they also possess a nuclear electric quadrupole moment (Q) but, whereas the orientation of the magnetic (spin) dipole is quantized relative to the external magnetic field, the orientation of Q is quantized relative to the electric field gradient (EFG) at the observed nucleus, arising from the local electronic environment (i.e., electrons and other surrounding nuclei). EFGs exert a torque on the quadrupolar nuclei and the tumbling of the molecule can then trigger transitions among the various nuclear spin states. The quadrupolar coupling constant is defined as \u03c7\n = \ne\n2\nQ(EFG)/h where h is Planck constant (6.626070 \u00d7 10\u2212 34\n J s).",

            "text": "To summarize, the development of NMR techniques for the direct detection of metal ions in biological systems has been hampered by the quadrupolar and paramagnetic properties of some of the biometals of interest. Nevertheless, several successful studies have been carried out in the field, which are reported in the following sections. (Note to chemical shift referencing: Given a specific NMR signal recorded for the nucleus X, its chemical shift (\u03b4) is defined as the difference between its resonance frequency (\u03bd\nX,sample in Hz) and the resonance frequency of the reference substance (\u03bd\nX,ref in Hz), divided by the operating frequency of the spectrometer (\u03bd\nX,spec in MHz): \u03b4\n = (\u03bd\nX,sample\n\u03bd\nX,ref)/\u03bd\nX,spec. Owing to the different units of numerator (Hz) and denominator (MHz), chemical shifts result in \u00d7 10\u2212 6 unitless figures. Therefore, for greater convenience, the factor of 106 difference is discarded and d is appropriately represented by the unit ppm (parts per million). NMR referencing is a rather delicate topic, and this issue is even more pronounced in the case of metal NMR spectroscopy. In fact, different reference substances and sign conventions have been used throughout the past decades, thus making the comparison of data reported in the literature difficult and somewhat misleading. Moreover, since salts are generally used as references, the actual chemical shifts may be strongly influenced by the nature of the counterion and by the concentration of the salt itself. In this article, the reported NMR parameters, including the reference samples and conditions, are those recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 2001, revised and updated in 2008).10 Nevertheless, the reader should be aware of the existence of a number of alternative references and conventions and should refer to the individual papers cited throughout the text for a correct comparison.)",

Both isotopes yield narrow spectral lines and long T\n1 (typically 2\u20138 s), but the higher natural isotopic abundance and receptivity and the more favorable relaxation properties make 7Li the isotope of choice for most studies (although 6Li NMR has been also employed).12 Owing to the relatively simple aqueous chemistry of the Li+ ion, the chemical shift range is rather small and spectra usually show a single (averaged) resonance from all environments, thus complicating the interpretation of the NMR signals of the usually heterogeneous biological systems. Therefore, it is often advantageous to resolve signals from the different compartments by either exploiting differences in relaxation properties or adding a shift reagent since each local Li(I) environment may potentially have a characteristic concentration and spin relaxation behavior.",

Although plasma lithium values are used to monitor the therapy, the lithium in red blood cells (RBCs) may provide a better estimate of levels in brain.15 For example, rats were treated with different amounts of Li2CO3 and, 24 h after administration, blood was collected, added with a Tm(III)-based shift reagent, and analyzed by 7Li NMR, providing a clear discrimination between plasma and RBC lithium signals.16 The 7Li spectrum (Fig. 1\n) shows two peaks about 13 ppm apart corresponding to plasma (extracellular) and RBC (intracellular) lithium.

In the center of the cycle formed by the four guanines, completely dehydrated alkali ions (usually K+ or Na+) are coordinated by the buried carbonyl oxygens of the nucleotides. Stacked G-quartets form an ion channel, and the presence of the cations is crucial for the formation, stability, and function of G-quadruplexes. The presence of G-quadruplexes in different regions of the genome suggests a biological relevance for these systems.27 Detection of alkali cations in G-quadruplexes has usually relied on either direct solid-state techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and solid-state NMR, or indirect methods using surrogate I\n = 1/2 probes, such as 15NH4+ and 205Tl+, in solution NMR experiments.28 On the basis of these studies, two types of alkali metal-binding sites were generally found in G-quadruplex structures, one type being loosely coordinated to phosphate groups and the other residing inside the G-quadruplex channel. For several years, direct detection by solution NMR of alkali ions was considered unfeasible due to low signal intensity and unfavorable quadrupolar properties. Nevertheless, Won and coworkers reported the first direct solution NMR detection of the Na+ residing inside G-quadruplex channel structures formed by 5\u2032-guanosinemonophosphate (5\u2032-GMP) and the DNA oligomer, d(TG4T).29\nFig. 2A shows 29Na NMR spectra for 0.8 M Na2(5\u2032-GMP) in an aqueous solution at pH 8. The signal centered at 0 ppm exhibits a bi-Lorentzian lineshape arising from the slow exchange of Na+ cations between phosphate-bound and free states. The small peak at \u2212 17 ppm is due to the Na+ cations residing inside the 5\u2032-GMP channel. The signal intensity for the channel Na+ cations decreases as the sample temperature increases from 278 to 308 K, an indication of \u201cmelting\u201d of the 5\u2032-GMP aggregates. Analogously (Fig. 2B), 23Na NMR spectra of d(TG4T) show the channel Na+ signal at \u2212 17 ppm but, in this case, the total integrated area for this signal remains approximately unchanged between 278 and 293 K, indicating that the G-quadruplex structure of d(TG4T) does not melt at 293 K.",

K+ is involved in the control of transmembrane potentials and regulates the equilibrium of cellular electrolytes and osmotic pressure. It acts primarily as counterion for negatively charged solutes and is involved in counterbalancing the high negative charge density associated with the nucleic acid phosphate backbone. The interaction with most biological ligands is weak and, as such, its direct binding is unlikely to be involved in the triggering of biological activity, although it seems to be required for the activation of a number of enzymes.21\n",

Furthermore, there could be uncertainty associated with the nonspecific binding of ions to the cell membrane and with ion fluxes during the separation procedure. Conversely, the possibility to develop nondestructive and noninvasive methods such as NMR spectroscopy is highly desirable. Naturally occurring potassium consists of the quadrupolar 39K, 40K, and 41K nuclides, the former being the isotope of choice for most NMR studies because of its higher natural abundance. Unfortunately, low sensitivity (compared to 7Li and 23Na) was proved a major drawback for the development of such analytical technique, as confirmed by the relatively few data reported in the literature. Nevertheless, as technology evolves, the detectability and quantification in different tissues by means of NMR spectroscopy have been improving over time. For instance, the recent development of a triple resonant (39K/23Na/1H) radiofrequency coil setup allowed the unprecedented acquisition of tissue images of a rat head in vivo by 39K MRI,31 and, more recently, a detailed investigation of the 39K magnetic resonance imaging of human muscle tissue in vivo has been reported.32\n",

The chemical shifts, linewidths, relaxation times, and quadrupolar coupling constants for the respective 43Ca NMR signals associated with high-affinity binding sites were quite similar, indicative of a high degree of homology between those sites in the four proteins.

The main medicinal application of boron is the tumor-targeted delivery of boron derivatives for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).61 The therapy is based on the nuclear reaction that occurs when the stable isotope 10B is irradiated with neutrons at appropriate energy to produce 11B in an unstable form, which then undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high-energy alpha particles and recoiling 7Li nuclei (10B + \nn\nth\n \u2192 [11B] \u2192 \u03b1 + \n7Li). These heavy charged particles have pathlengths of approximately one cell diameter (10\u201314 \u03bcm) and deposit most of their energy within the boron-containing cells. Provided that boron-based therapeutics are delivered and accumulate preferentially in tumors and enough low energy thermal neutrons (n\nth) reach the target site, cancer cells undergo necrosis as a result of the 10B(n,\u03b1)7Li capture reaction. BNCT has been used clinically to treat patients with brain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme, with high-grade gliomas, and a much smaller number with primary and metastatic melanoma. Delivery vehicles synthesized for this application include sodium borocaptate (BSH, Na2B12H11SH), borano phosphonates and borano bis(phosphonates), borano phosphate oligodeoxynucleotides, in which BH3 is linked to the phosphate backbone of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides,61b and carboranes.61d\n",

Both 10B and 11B are NMR-active, but 11B has higher sensitivity and natural abundance. Therefore, although 10B is the nucleus used in BNCT treatment, the more sensitive 11B is more appropriate for NMR studies, since the isotopic difference does not alter the structure, binding, or the pharmacokinetic effects of the BNCT agents. Both isotopes are quadrupolar and their relaxation times are rather short. NMR research efforts have been primarily moved toward two directions: first, to investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of BNCT agents in vivo and, second, to use localized NMR spectroscopy and/or MRI for noninvasive mapping of the administered molecules. While the first goal can be accomplished by 11B NMR for natural abundance samples, molecules used in BNCT are generally enriched (> 95%) in the less favorable (in terms of NMR properties) 10B nucleus. Anyway, the use of 10B MRI was proved successful to evaluate the distribution in vivo of these agents62 and, in this regard, much attention has been recently given to the exploitation of boron nitride nanotubes containing Fe paramagnetic impurities63 and to dual gadolinium/boron compounds as contrast agents.64\n",

It has a positively charged surface that is believed to bind mitochondrial enzymes, small anions, and metabolites. Such surface interaction influences the efficiency of the proton transfer and the mobility of the protein itself. Borate ions were shown by 11B NMR to bind specifically to cytochrome c surface, and this interaction could be used as a model for anion\u2013protein surface interaction.67\nFig. 9A shows the 11B spectrum at 11.4 T of a 100 mM borate solution in presence of 4 mM ferricytochrome c at pH 9.7 at 5\u00b0C.

When MQF NMR experiments were carried out (Fig. 9B), two narrow signals related to the specific binding sites of ferricytochrome c and a broad peak owing to the borate/boric acid were detected (at ~ 2 and 7.1 ppm, respectively), suggesting two different types of binding sites designated as I (for slowly exchanging borate ion) and II (for fast exchanging borate ion and boric acid).",

In particular, due to the increasing acidity of the environment and the concomitant increased dissolution of aluminum minerals, the concentration of this element in freshwaters has become a considerable issue. On the other hand, aluminum-based drugs are sold as antacids (Al(OH)3 and Al2(CO3)3) and for the treatment of malaria (Al(OH)3).

First, the maximum intensity of the protein-bound 27Al signal is substantially lower than that observed for equimolar solutions of the free metal ion. Secondly, the signals exhibit a unique pulse angle dependence where a maximum in peak intensity is attained at pulse lengths that are less than half the 90 degrees pulse for aqueous Al3 + solutions. Third, 27Al signals for Al3 + bound to the half-molecules of ovotransferrin are much broader than those for the intact protein, thus reflecting the importance of molecular motion on the detectability of quadrupolar nuclei. Finally, the increase of the external magnetic field strength causes line narrowing and a 2\u20134 ppm downfield dynamic frequency shift (Fig. 11\n).73 The chemical shifts of the 27Al signals from Al2-ovotransferrin were found from + 40 to \u2212 46 ppm, which is in accordance with a six-coordinate (octahedral) Al(III) complex. From these assignments and titration experiments, it was found that, in the presence of carbonate, the N-terminal site of ovotransferrin binds Al3 + with a higher affinity than the C-terminal site. Interestingly, changing the synergistic anion to oxalate alters the specificity (Fig. 12\n).72a\n",

Together with imaging applications, the Auger electrons emitted by 67Ga possess potent cytotoxicity pointing toward potential therapeutic applications of the radionuclide, whereas the positrons emitted by 68Ga may also have therapeutic applications in the prevention of restenosis by intracoronary radiation therapy.79 Although most reports on gallium pharmaceutical chemistry relate to applications of its radioisotopes, the tumor-seeking and antineoplastic properties of nonradioactive Ga3 + salts were already recognized in the 1970s when, for example, safety and activity of intravenous gallium(III) nitrate were extensively studied in clinical trials.80 The development of gallium-based anticancer agents has been pursued as a strategy to circumvent the limitations faced with simple gallium salts. In particular, efforts to improve bioavailability via the oral route have recently led to the selection of the complexes tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46) and tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-onato)gallium(III) (gallium maltolate) for clinical studies.81\n",

They have high receptivity, 203Tl being only slightly less receptive than 31P, whereas 205Tl is the third most receptive I\n = 1/2 nuclide. Because of its similarity to the alkali metal ions, Tl+ has potential as probe for Na+ and K+ in biological systems. 205Tl NMR can be used to investigate directly the specific binding sites of transferrins. Due to its high receptivity, 205Tl NMR signals of protein-bound Tl3 + ions can be observed even at mM concentrations. The first 205Tl NMR study of human serum transferrin was reported over 40 years ago by Bertini and coworkers.85 They showed that 205Tl NMR is a suitable probe to monitor the occupancy of the two available transferrin binding sites, thus characterizing both the dithallium- and the monothallium-transferrin derivatives with carbonate as synergistic anion. The high affinity of the protein for trivalent metal ions was thought to be responsible for the stabilization of the + 3 oxidation state of the metal. Two distinct 205Tl NMR signals (at + 2075 and + 2055 ppm downfield from aqueous Tl+) of similar shape were found for the Tl(III)2-transferrin derivative at physiological pH. The two signals are relatively broad (\u0394v\n1/2\n ~ 100 Hz) and show a different pH dependence (the signal at + 2055 ppm proved more resistant to acidification). At physiological pH, the Tl3 + ion was shown to bind sequentially to the two sites; the signal at + 2055 ppm appeared first and was assigned to Tl3 + bound to the acid-resistant C-terminal site. The signal at + 2075 ppm was assigned to Tl3 + bound to the N-terminal site. By using 13C NMR spectroscopy to study the 13CO3\u2013205Tl-transferrin derivative, it was shown that the 13C nucleus of the synergistic anion is strongly magnetically coupled to the 205Tl nucleus so that its 13C signal is split into a doublet. Analogously, in the 13C NMR spectrum of (13CO3\u2013205Tl)2 transferrin, two superimposed doublets are recorded, the extent of the coupling constants (290 and 265 Hz) being typical of a 2\nJ(205Tl\u201313C) coupling. This result provided evidence of carbonate coordination to the metal.86 Similar experiments were carried out by Aramini and coworkers to investigate the binding of 205Tl to chicken ovotransferrin in the presence of carbonate as the synergistic anion.87 Two 205Tl NMR signals due to the bound metal ion in the two high-affinity iron-binding sites of the protein were detected and, from titration studies, it was demonstrated that Tl3 + shows no site preference in ovotransferrin. Again, when 13C-labeled carbonate was used, two closely spaced doublets in the carbonyl region of the 13C NMR spectrum of ovotransferrin were recorded due to the coupling between the bound metal ion and carbonate (2\nJ(205Tl\u201313C)) ranging from 270 to 290 Hz).",

Compared to KCl, TlNO3 was shown to activate pyruvate kinase to 80%\u201390% activity, in combination with Mn(NO3)2 as the activating divalent cation. At higher Tl+ concentrations, enzyme inhibition occurs, and the extent of such inhibition is also dependent on the nature and concentration of the divalent cation. In this regard, the effect of Mn2 + on the relaxation properties of 205Tl+ was determined by 205Tl NMR spectroscopy. The distance between Tl+ and Mn2 + at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase was calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn2 + to the longitudinal relaxation rates of the bound Tl+. Similar measurements were performed to monitor structural alterations introduced at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase by mutation of Thr29889 and showed that the mutation influences the interaction between the mono- and the divalent cations, both interacting with the phosphoryl group of the substrate at the active site of the enzyme.",

Tin has ten natural isotopes, of which three have I\n = 1/2. Among them, 115Sn is the least NMR favorable isotope, because of its extremely low natural abundance. As a result, it has been only rarely studied, for example, to overcome difficulties in unraveling strongly coupled homonuclear n\nJ(119Sn\u2013119Sn) scalar coupling satellites in di-tin compounds.99 The \u201ctwins\u201d 117Sn and 119Sn nuclei have rather similar properties, but 119Sn NMR spectroscopy is, by far, the most widely used in tin chemistry because of both its slightly higher magnetic moment and natural abundance. Thus, not surprisingly, the use of NMR in tin chemistry has been widely reviewed.100 In particular, the use of 117/119Sn NMR spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between organotin complexes and biomolecules such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids has been extensively reviewed, including equilibrium, structural, and biological studies.101\n",

            "text": "The toxicological implications of lead derivatives have spurred a number of studies aimed at investigating their interaction with various proteins.107 For example, Pb2 + can bind very tightly to, and even displace Ca2 + from, calmodulin, calbindin, and troponin C. Moreover, it can replace calcium in the activation of several enzymes, including protein kinase C, phosphodiesterase, and myosin light chain kinase, the latter two in a calmodulin-dependent way. Therefore, model systems are needed for lead bound to Ca-binding sites in proteins, as these interactions are thought to account for lead's toxicity. For example, the high-affinity Ca2 +-binding sites of carp (pI 4.25) and pike (pI 5.0) parvalbumins, as well as those of mammalian calmodulin and its C-terminal tryptic half-molecule (TR2C), have been investigated by 207Pb NMR spectroscopy.108 For the parvalbumins, two 207Pb signals are observed, with chemical shifts ranging from + 750 to + 1260 ppm downfield of aqueous Pb(NO3)2, corresponding to 207Pb2 + bound to the two high-affinity helix\u2013loop\u2013helix Ca2 +-binding sites. Four 207Pb signals, recorded in the same chemical shift window, can be discerned for calmodulin (Fig. 13\n). Experiments on TR2C allowed the assignment of each signal due to 207Pb2 + occupying a helix\u2013loop\u2013helix site in either the N- or the C-lobe of the intact protein. 207Pb and 1H NMR titration studies on calmodulin have provided evidence that Pb2 + binding to all four sites occurs simultaneously, in contrast to the behavior of the same protein in the presence of Ca2 +. The large chemical shift dispersion observed for the 207Pb signals of the three investigated proteins illustrates the remarkable sensitivity of this parameter to subtle differences in the chemical environment of the protein-bound 207Pb nucleus.",

As already shown for 27Al (see text earlier), 45Sc NMR can be used to probe metal-binding sites in large proteins. The solution chemistry of scandium is based entirely on Sc3 +, which forms almost exclusively six-coordinate complexes. The ionic radius of Sc3 + is only slightly larger than Fe3 + (0.75 vs. 0.65 \u00c5), thus making it a suitable probe for the Fe(III)-binding sites of transferrins in which the metal ion is coordinated by six donor atoms, four from the side chains of four protein residues and two from the synergistic anion (i.e., carbonate), in a distorted octahedral geometry. In this regard, the binding of Sc3 + to chicken ovotransferrin has been investigated by 45Sc and 13C NMR spectroscopy.121 In the presence of carbonate, both 45Sc and 13C NMR spectra show two signals assigned to the bound 45Sc3 + and 13CO32\u2212 groups in the N- and C-binding sites of the protein (Fig. 15\n). Several properties of the transferrin-bound 45Sc signals, such as their dependence on pulse length, magnetic field, protein size, and temperature, are consistent with the detection of only the central transition of the quadrupolar nucleus in conditions far away from the extreme narrowing ones. Additionally, from the 45Sc chemical shift and linewidth data recorded at four magnetic fields, the quadrupolar coupling constants and the rotational correlation time have been calculated for the bound metal ion in each site of the protein. Remarkably, this work represented the first, and so far the only, 45Sc NMR study of a metalloprotein. More recent relevant reports have been dealing with the use of 45Sc NMR spectroscopy for the characterization of Sc(III) derivatives as potential PET agents and radiopharmaceuticals.122\n",

On the contrary, V(IV) is much less flexible, with square pyramidal or, if a sixth position is occupied, distorted octahedral geometries. Vanadium derivatives readily undergo redox reactions under physiological conditions and form both cationic and anionic complexes.

Phase I clinical trial of bis(ethylmaltolato)oxovanadium(IV) was completed in 2000, and the results of the phase II clinical trial were first published in 2009.79, 132 Moreover, the anticancer potential of, for example, vanadocene derivatives and a vanadium(IV)\u2013aspirin complex is currently being investigated.133 Coordination compounds of vanadium, which may have pharmacological relevance, include not only vanadate [VOxLy] and vanadyl [VOLz] derivatives but also the peroxovanadates [VO(O2)(H2O)(L\u2013L\u2032)]n \u2212 (n\n = 0, 1) and [VO(O2)2(L\u2013L\u2032)]n \u2212 (n\n = 1, 2, 3).134\n",

As shown in Fig. 16A, in basic solution, only one peak (V\n1) at \u2212 537 ppm was observed and assigned to mixed protonation states of vanadate. As the pH was lowered, peaks V\n2 ([VO2(maltolate)2]\u2212) and V\n3 ([VO2(maltolate)(OH)(H2O)]\u2212) appeared at \u2212 496 and \u2212 510 ppm, respectively. As the acidity of the solution increased, peak V\n1 shifted downfield and disappeared below pH 5.5. By comparison with the variable pH 51V NMR spectra of NH4[VO2(maltolate)2] (Fig. 16B), it was proved that some V(V) complexes form in a solution of [VIVO (maltolato)2], even under relatively acidic conditions.",

The Mn superoxide dismutase enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, as nearly all aerobic organisms use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide.157 In addition to its important biological role, manganese may have several therapeutic uses, including the treatment of arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and HIV.158\n",

Very little is known about the dependence of \u03b4(99Ru) on structure and temperature; thus, it is not surprising that few 99Ru NMR spectroscopic studies have been reported.168 In addition, due to the presence of unpaired electrons, Ru(III) compounds cannot be directly detected by 99Ru NMR spectroscopy, so 99Ru(II) is the only NMR-observable ruthenium isotope. To date, 99Ru NMR spectroscopy has been successfully employed for Ru(II) complexes having highly symmetrical environments around the metal nucleus.169\n",

The bioinorganic chemistry of copper is dominated by + 1 and + 2 oxidation states. Almost all of the copper in the human body is bound to transport proteins (ceruloplasmin and copper\u2013albumin), storage proteins (metallothioneins), or copper-containing enzymes, whereas unbound free copper is not found in large quantities. Copper is essential for the proper functioning of copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase (energy production), superoxide dismutase (antioxidant protection), tyrosinase (pigmentation), dopamine hydroxylase (catecholamine production), lysyl oxidase (collagen and elastin formation), clotting factor V (blood clotting), and ceruloplasmin (antioxidant protection, iron metabolism, and copper transport). In addition to its enzymatic roles, copper is used for biological electron transport. The \u201cblue copper\u201d proteins (named after their intense blue color arising from a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer absorption band at ~ 600 nm) that participate in electron transport include azurin and plastocyanin.21 Copper is a redox active nucleus and may be also involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species. In this regard, the interaction of copper complexes with nucleic acids and their capability to damage DNA have been investigated.186 In addition, some artificial DNA enzymes were shown to have Cu2 +-dependent activity.187 Finally, some copper complexes are currently being investigated for their potential anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity.188\n",

For example, the 109Ag chemical shift differs from about 50 ppm for 1 and 9 M (nearly saturated) AgNO3 aqueous solutions,194 and since aqueous AgNO3 is frequently used as reference and often its concentration is not stated, this makes the direct comparison of 109Ag NMR chemical shifts reported in the literature rather difficult.",

This quadrupolar nucleus is characterized by low sensitivity and low resonance frequency. The required concentration for Zn2 + to be detected by NMR is typically high (> 0.1 M) but lower concentrations can be utilized following isotopic enrichment. Anyway, due to the quadrupolar nature of the nuclide, even if solution NMR methods afforded observable zinc resonances in a metalloprotein, the resulting linewidths would likely obscure the determination of site-specific isotropic chemical shifts. Consequently, it is not surprising that the literature of 67Zn NMR data in solution is scarce and, among those reports, only a very few are biologically relevant. In this regard, 67Zn NMR has been used to study the environment and/or behavior of Zn2 + interacting with proteins, such as concanavalin, calmodulin, thermolysin, and S100.205\n",

In recent years, however, dramatic improvements in the solid-state NMR of quadrupolar nuclides have occurred. A general strategy for the observation of low-\u03b3 half-integer quadrupolar nuclides has been developed, involving a combination of low temperature (4\u2013100 K) with cross-polarization experiments employing specific spin-echo sequences.206 Nevertheless, although such methodology affords sufficient sensitivity to examine Zn2 +-binding sites, as far as we are aware of, still few reports are available to date in the literature describing the use of solid-state 67Zn NMR for the study of zinc in metalloproteins or in zinc complexes as models for active sites of metalloproteins.207\n",

In this regard, NMR was used to probe indirectly the presence of linear {T\u2013Hg(II)\u2013T} base pairs in DNA duplexes containing mismatched thymidine residues (T). The authors treated DNA duplexes containing differently 15N-labeled mismatched thymidines with natural abundance Hg(II) showing that, in addition to a strong shift of the 15N resonances upon metallation (\u0394\u03b4\n > 30 ppm), a mercury-mediated coupling was clearly observed between the two metal-coordinated N (3) atoms of the opposite thymidine involved in the artificial base pairing (2\nJ(15N,15N) = 2.4 Hz).225 Similarly, Hg(II) was reacted with RNA duplexes containing up to 20 uridine mismatches, leading to the formation of mercury-mediated base pairs of the type {U\u2013Hg(II)\u2013U}.6, 226 The authors focused on a 22-nucleotide long palindromic sequence containing six successive uracil residues and could prove the incorporation of Hg(II) by means of a combination of NMR methods, including 1H, 15N, 199Hg, and 1H diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR experiments. Interestingly, the only detectable 199Hg was that originated by free Hg(II) ions in solution, most likely accounting for the kinetically labile metal binding and the strong line broadening owing to 199Hg chemical shift anisotropy relaxation. Anyway, the last examples showed that even if direct observation of 199Hg may be somehow elusive, the incorporation of Hg2 + in nucleic acids can be confidently assessed by a combination of different more classical NMR techniques.",

Gadolinium also has potential for use in neutron capture therapy with the advantage that its uptake can be monitored by MRI. There are two main goals for future development. One is to control the biological behavior (cellular uptake and retention, tissue targeting, and in vivo stability) by incorporating Gd(III) into bioconjugates, such as lipids with acid labile bonds. The other is to improve the efficiency with which the complexes induce spin relaxation in protons of water molecules, by designing chelators to control exchange rates of coordinated, or hydrogen-bonded water molecules, and by controlling the mobility and rotation (e.g., through molecular size) of complexes. These two goals can be merged by designing agents whose spin relaxation properties are dependent on the physiological environment, so that MRI scans can provide biochemical/physiological and structural information.229\n",

GSH is an important sulfur-containing tripeptide that plays a role in cells as a source of chemical reduction potential through its sulfhydryl group. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with sulfhydryl groups to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme A and \u03b1-lipoic acid.

The moderate Q leads to an efficient quadrupolar relaxation and to broad NMR signals (from few to thousands hertz). Reasonably narrow resonances can be obtained only for small molecules in which the sulfur atom is located at sites with high electronic symmetry, such as the tetrahedral SO42\u2212 anion and low-molecular-weight sulfones and sulfonates. In thiols, sulfides, sulfoxides, and other organic and inorganic functional groups with low symmetry, 33S linewidths are often larger than 10 000 Hz, and the signals are observable only in a limited number of cases. Large linewidths prevent the accurate measurement of chemical shifts, may cause the overlap of resonances when more than one type of sulfur atom is present, and have a significant influence on the achievable signal-to-noise ratio, thus consequently affecting the experimental times needed to obtain reasonable spectra.",

In this regard, 19F NMR proved useful to study such conformational changes by incorporating a fluorine label either into a nucleobase, for example, by using 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorocytosine,275 or at the sugar moiety.276 Micura and coworkers showed that the 2\u2032-19F labeling of the ribose can be used to discriminate between double helical and single-stranded regions in RNAs,276 and to study RNA hairpin/duplex equilibriums, providing accurate melting temperature values.277 More recently, they also reported on the use of 19F NMR spectroscopy for the evaluation of the ligand-induced conformational change of a riboswitch, that is, an RNA element located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of mRNA that controls gene expression upon conformational change induced by ligand binding.278\n",

On the other hand, the iodide ion may be conveniently detected. For example, 127I has been used as a probe for the anion-binding properties of human serum albumin,288 and analogous studies have been performed to investigate the binding of iodide to some peroxidases.289 The application of 127I NMR spectroscopy to study the enzymatic degradation of \u03ba-carrageenan has been recently reported.290\n",
