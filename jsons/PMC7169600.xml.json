In this study, we opted for the selection of the MHC\u2010I molecules with coupled IC50 value less than 200 nm (IC50 <200), this ensured the selection of the MHC\u2010I molecules (Table 1) for which the selected epitopes showed higher affinity. MHC\u2010I processing efficiency tool of IEDB generates an overall score for every epitope accordingly their proteasomal cleavage efficiency, TAP transport efficiency and MHC\u2010I binding efficiency combined. The combined score represented the potentiality of the peptides for presentation, the higher the score, the better they are, and this is the most crucial step for initiating a successful immune response.
