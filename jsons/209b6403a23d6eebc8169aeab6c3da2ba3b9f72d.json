Regardless of most COVID-19 patients are mild, patients with severe type may quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure (MOF) and even death (Wang Y. et al., 2020) . Therefore, exploring potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 is crucial for delay or halt the progression of the disease. Previous studies have revealed that patients with old age and underlying diseases are more likely to be aggravated (Wang D. et al., 2020 , Wang Z. et al., 2020 , and aberrant immune-inflammatory response and cytokine storm may played an important role in the disease progression (Zhou Yonggang et al., 2020) .",

Liu et al took a further step to analyze the kinetic change of lymphocyte subsets and observed neutrophil-to-CD8 + T cell ratio (N8R) to be the most powerful prognostic factor(Liu   Jing et al., 2020). Besides, a recent study indicated the AUROCs of threeinflammation markers white blood cell (WBC), CRP and serum amyloid A (SAA) in single and combine forms were 0.814, 0.742, 0.673, and 0.924 respectively for predicting severe and critically severe COVID-19 cases (Shi et al., 2020). Our study confirmed again for the predictive value of immune-inflammation parameters, with AUROCs ranging from 0.682 to 0.835 in this study, among them, IL-6 had the largest AUROC. However, only IL-6, CRP and hypertension entered the final risk model revealed by multivariate logistic regression analysis and the AUROC of the risk model was as high as 0.900.CRP is an acute phase reactive protein, and parallels to the severity of inflammatory. A previous study and a recent study have revealed its role in predicting the severity of patients with SARS and SARS-COV-2(Shi et al., 2020, Wang et al.,   2004.

A recent study confirmed the role of IL-6 by using the peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 cases for immune analysis, indicated that GM-CSF + Th1 cells and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes with high expression of IL-6 accelerated the excessive immune response and deteriorated the disease(Zhou Yonggang et al., 2020). In addition, two prior studies reported the dynamic change of IL-6 in severe COVID-19 cases, from a high level at baseline to a low level when cured(Liu Jing et al., 2020,   Liu Tao et al., 2020. Our study was in consist with them, and considered it has a potential value for monitoring the condition of severe COVID-19 cases.A very recent study reported that massive mucus was aggregated in the distal respiratory tract by autopsying two body donors of fatal cases with COVID-19 (Wang Chaofu et al., 2020). IL-6 may linked to the increased mucus production in COVID-19 patients for its ability of stimulating the predominant mucin genes, MUC5AC and MUC5B expression in tracheobronchial epithelial cells(Chen et al., 2003). In view of the pivotal role of IL-6 in cytokine storm and mucus production, and tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, have achieved an effective treatment for severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS)(Gupta et al., 2020,   Tanaka et al., 2016, IL-6 blockade treatment is worthy of expectation for treating the severe COVID-19 patients.",
