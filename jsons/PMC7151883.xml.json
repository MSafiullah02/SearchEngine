In this chapter we analyze the binding and dissociation (if applicable) kinetics of other biomarkers on biosensor surfaces. Some of the examples analyzed include the following:1.Binding to and dissociation of different aptamer beacon modifications of interferon (IFN)-gamma in solution using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and immobilized on an avidin-coated surface (Tuleuova et al., 2010).2.Binding and dissociation of Glutathione S-transferase fused to the N-terminus of a protein (GST-N) protein in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to a localized surface plasmon resonance coupled fluorescence (LSPCF) biosensor (Huang et al., 2009).3.Binding of a cytochrome c mutant to an amperometric superoxide biosensor (Wegerich et al., 2009).4.Binding of different concentrations (in micromoles) of carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II) in solution to immobilized 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonamide (ABS) using signal-locking surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Williams et al., 2010).5.Binding to and dissociation from a microfluidic platform of 50 \u03bcM glycerol secreted from differentiated (murine 3T3) adipocytes (Clark et al., 2010).6.Binding of different concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) to a new sandwich-type assay design using a label-free detection method.\n",

Havlin (1989) indicates that the crossover value may be determined by rc\n2\n \u223c tc. Above the characteristic length, rc, the self-similarity of the surface is lost and the surface may be considered homogeneous. Above time tc the surface may be considered homogeneous, since the self-similarity property disappears, and \u201cregular\u201d diffusion is now present. For a homogeneous surface where Df\n = 2, and when only diffusional limitations are present, p = \u00bd as it should be. Another way of looking at the p = \u00bd case (where Df,bind\n = 2) is that the analyte in solution views the fractal object, in our case, the receptor-coated biosensor surface, from a \u201clarge distance.\u201d In essence, in the association process, the diffusion of the analyte from the solution to the receptor surface creates a depletion layer of width (\u00d0t)\u00bd where \u00d0 is the diffusion constant. This gives rise to the fractal power law (Analyte.Receptor) \u223c \nt(3\u2212Df,bind)/2. For the present analysis, tc is arbitrarily chosen and we assume that the value of the tc is not reached.

This is further corroborated by low values of r2 factor (goodness of fit). In that case, one resorts to a dual-fractal analysis (four parameters; k1, k2, Df1, and Df2) to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The single-fractal analysis presented above is thus extended to include two fractal dimensions. At present, the time (t = t1) at which the \u201cfirst\u201d fractal dimension \u201cchanges\u201d to the \u201csecond\u201d fractal dimension is arbitrary and empirical.

(1997) indicate that it is secreted by immune cells in response to various pathogens. Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that the levels of this protein provide important information with regard to infectious diseases and the ability of the body to regulate an immune response. Panteleo and Koup (2004) indicate that there is vigorous production of IFN-gamma in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that previous antibody-based detection techniques for IFN-gamma were very time consuming. Jayasena (1999) indicates that aptamer-based affinity strategies are coming into prominence. Ellington and Szostak (1990) indicate that aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that have been selected to bind to target analytes with high specificity and affinity. Aptamers have an advantage over antibodies since they are more robust; thus, aptamer-based biosensors can be regenerated and used over and over again. Furthermore, Balamurugan et al. (2008), Kirby et al. (2004), Nutiu (2005), and Luzi et al. (2003) indicate that aptamers are amenable to modification due to their simplicity and robustness. Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that FRET may be used to convert aptamers into real-time biosensors (Urata et al., 2007; Babendure et al., 2003).",

Surface plasmon resonance is a popular technique to analyze biomolecular interactions at a surface, especially since it is label-free. These authors indicate that the SPR technique is subject to the influence of noise and drift disturbances since that limits the minimum detectable mass change. The SPR technique uses the step response of the biomolecular interactions occurring on the biosensor surface. The technique proposed by Williams et al. (2010) measures the biomolecular interactions over a very narrow frequency range. This locks the measured response to a very specific narrow band signal. The authors used their technique to analyze the binding kinetics of carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II) and immobilized 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonamide (ABS) to a SPR surface.",

These anhydrases are classified as metalloenzymes since the active site of most carbonic anhydrases contains a zinc ion. The primary function of this enzyme in animals is to maintain the acid-base balance in blood and other tissues, and to help transport carbon dioxide out of tissues. Carbon anhydrase II is a novel biomarker for gasterointestinal stomal tumors (Parkkila et al., 2010). These authors indicate that various carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoenzymes have been identified as potential targets against different cancers. They further indicate that high CA-II expression is associated with a better disease specific survival rate than low or no expression.",

Albrecht et al. (2010) further indicate that a drawback of the sandwich assay format is the need for immobilization of the capture antibody on the surface. This often results in a significant loss in binding activity. Also, there is no guarantee that the binding sites on the antibodies immobilized on the surface are oriented in the \u2018correct\u2019 direction. This hinders the biosensor performance parameters such as sensitivity, loss in function, and stability of the sensor surface.
