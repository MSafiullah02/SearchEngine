This is a tool to assess physical, cognitive and functional frailty, reflecting both comorbidities and physiological reserve, which can be applied to all adult individuals, regardless of age or type of underlying disease, allowing equity in the assessment. Frailty in ICU patients is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality and also for no home return. (\n12\n,\n13\n) The allocation of resources, then, is based on the score of the selected scale, which defines the degree of priority (Table 2).",
