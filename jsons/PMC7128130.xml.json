Triton X-100 is a non-ionic surfactant which can disrupt the lipid membrane of enveloped viruses without affecting proteins. It is therefore widely used in combination with tri-(N-butyl)-phosphate (TnBP) for solvent\u2013detergent inactivation procedures of plasma products for transfusion [6]. Besides, Triton X-100 0.1% has been successfully evaluated for haematology and clinical chemistry [7], [8], [9], [10] and for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) [11], [12]. Accuracy of immunoassays after Triton X-100 treatment of serum was only partially assessed in 1988 and no decrease in sensitivity was reported [13].",

Concerning detergents, complete inactivation of HIV was achieved with 0.2% of Triton X-100 [13] whereas EBOV treatment with 0.1% of Triton X-100 led to incomplete inactivation with a 4 log infectivity reduction [22]. Besides, it has been recently claimed that the inactivation potential of Triton X-100 0.1% was annulled in serum [10]. Inactivation tests were indeed performed on EBOV and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in 0.98%, 9.8%, or 98% serum, and viral inactivation by Triton X-100 only succeeded in medium with less than 10% serum, suggesting that some factors in serum interfere with detergent effects. In practice, Triton X-100 concentration is often increased to 1% to ensure a higher level of safety although no inactivation data support this choice. It thus remains to be determined if a higher concentration of Triton X-100 can overcome efficiency issues in serum.",

This remains, however, to be tested especially for EBOV, which is a rather stable virus [2], [3]. Preliminary results of EBOV inactivation with Triton X-100 1% for 20 min are promising [27]. Other proven inactivation methods such as the combination of Triton X-100 and heat against EBOV [2], [14], [28] are unfortunately not compatible with serological diagnosis and should be limited to molecular diagnosis.

The initial step of adding detergent to the serum sample does however require trained personnel, rigorous safety practices, and a biosafety cabinet of level 2. Triton X-100 has a long history of usage in diagnostic procedures; nevertheless, it is unknown if high concentrations of detergent could potentially affect routine laboratory analysers. Another limitation to the broad usage of Triton X-100 consists in environmental concerns. This reagent will soon be forbidden in Europe because of its endocrine disruption effects in aquatic organisms [29]. Restricted usage for well-defined procedures and appropriate waste treatment solutions will most probably still be possible in future. Ecofriendly alternatives such as lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO) [30] have been shown to exhibit effective virus inactivation in a broad range of protein concentrations but need further evaluation with different viruses and conditions.",
