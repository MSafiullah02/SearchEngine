            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by the acute onset of pulmonary edema of non-cardiogenic origin, along with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and reduction in respiratory system compliance in the seriously ill patient. ARDS is a complex response of the lung to direct and indirect insults associated with high morbidity and mortality, with current treatments mainly being supportive, without accurate targeted therapies [1, 2]. Directions of research are concentrating on identifying potential biomarkers or genetic markers to facilitate diagnosis, and to assist in prediction of outcome and treatment response. Recently, our group found that the serum level of Glypican-3 (GPC3), a proteoglycan anchored to cell surface by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, was significantly higher in the circulation of patients with severe pneumonia, as compared with healthy control, and increased even more significantly in patients with severe pneumonia accompanied with ARDS than those with severe pneumonia alone [3]. We proposed that the circulating level of glypican-3 may correlate with the severity of pneumonia as potential biomarker to predict the occurrence of ARDS. GPC3 has been recently reported and suggested as a novel potential oncofetal biomarker for diagnosis in a number of cancer diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma [4]. It has previously been demonstrated that GPC3 was over-expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma measured by cDNA microarrays, and GPC3 protein was found in serum from 40% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, but not in serum from patients with liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and healthy donors [4]. Therefore, GPC3 was proposed as a useful tumor marker for cancer-diagnosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Specific role of GPC3 in cancer and inflammatory disease at different times seems to have a clear and reasonable disease control, e.g., severe pneumonia with or without ARDS, or virus-infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared with other liver diseases [3, 4]. The significant increases in expression of GPC3 in hepatocellular carcinoma and ARDS raise the question whether GPC3 has utility as a biomarker of disease or disease severity [5\u20138]. The present commentary calls for further research into the molecular biology, disease-specific associations, and potential value as a biomarker of GPC3.",

It is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan belonging to the glypican-related integral membrane proteoglycan family [10], which includes six members (GPC1\u2013GPC6). According to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of gene sequences, these six members are divided into two subfamilies; one group is GPC3 and GPC5 which show 43% sequence homology, while the other group contains GPC1, GPC2, GPC4, and GPC6 [11]. GPC3 is encoded at chromosome Xp26 adjacent to GPC4, and spans more than 500 kilobases. Four isoforms have been reported, of which isoform 2 (GenBank Accession No.: NP_004475), which encodes a 70-kDa precursor core protein with 580 amino acids, is the most commonly expressed [12].",

            "text": "Glypicans are composed of a 60\u201370 kDa size membrane-associated core protein, a variable number of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide side chains, and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. The core protein is predicted to form a conserved globular tertiary structure because of several intramolecular disulfide bridges caused by 14 conserved cysteine residues domains. Heparan sulfate chains bind to serine residues of core protein carboxyl terminal protein [13], and approximate the core protein to the cell membrane. A glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage anchor becomes the final connecting link between the core protein and the cell membrane. GPC3 has one 40-kDa amino terminal protein and one 30-kDa membrane-bound carboxyl terminal protein. The amino acid sequences for the two different terminal proteins are Arg358 and Ser359, which can be enzymatically lyzed releasing a soluble form of GPC3 (sGPC3). sGPC3 can be specifically detected in the circulating blood of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [14]. Secreted GPC3 can also be cleaved by notum, a secreted enzyme, into a released form in the extracellular environment [15]. The notum\u2019s cleavage site and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage-phospholipase C, the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage anchor of GPC3, are two distinct soluble GPC3 forms, each having different functions.",

The high positive rate of GPC3 in hepatocellular carcinoma indicates the specificity of GPC3 in hepatocyte-origin carcinogenesis. GPC3 was considered as important as alpha-fetoprotein in a fast and effective cell sorting strategy to specifically identify hepatocellular carcinoma circulating cells [24]. The positive rate of hepatocellular carcinoma circulating cells was above 90% in combination of GPC3 with alpha-fetoprotein. The hepatocellular carcinoma cells positive to both GPC3 and cytokeratin 19 were found to have the highest risk of multifocality, microvascular invasion, regional lymph node involvement, shortest recurrence time, and distant metastasis in a retrospective study of immunohistochemical staining [25]. The combination of GPC3 and cytokeratin 19 expression in the cancer tissue was suggested as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",

MicroRNA-133b is a small non-coding RNA which targets Sirt1s, suppressing its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, increasing the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the activation of E-cadherin expression, and repressing expression of GPC3 and the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) [26]. It is questioned whether the GPC3/Wnt \u03b2-catenin signal pathway is miR-133b/Sirt1-specific regulation or is the hepatocellular carcinoma cell-specific and/or dominated mechanism. A clinical trial of codrituzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against GPC3, was recently performed in a randomized phase II trial in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients who had failed prior systemic therapy [27]. It was proposed that GPC3 could interact with CD16/Fc\u03b3RIIIa and trigger antibody-dependent cytotoxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Patients with vascular invasion and/or extra-hepatic metastasis were treated with sorafenib and then with codrituzumab or placebo. This particular study with 125 patients with codrituzumab failed to show any significant improvement of the median progression-free survival and overall survival, even though those patients had high CD16/Fc\u03b3RIIIa expression on peripheral immune cells and GPC3 expression in the tumor.",

The importance of GPC3 was furthermore validated in lung cancer cell lines. It was proposed that the over-expression of GPC3 may be induced by smoking, although no direct evidence to support this has been reported. High expression of GPC3 was noticed in lung cancer tissues, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma. GPC3 protein and mRNA expression were positive in 55% of squamous cell carcinoma versus 8% of adenocarcinoma, but negative in normal lung tissues [28]. The suggestion that GPC3 was suggested as a potential candidate marker for early detection of lung squamous cell carcinoma should be questioned, since about half of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma have negative GPC3 staining, and because it is hard to access the lung tissue at the early stage of the disease.",

In addition, an early study demonstrated an increased apoptosis response caused by ectopic expression of GPC3 in human lung carcinoma tumor cell, and GPC3 would be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene [30], although little has been known on accurate mechanisms of GPC3 in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer.",

GPC3 was firstly reported as a disease-specific biomarker for ARDS [3]. GPC3 was identified by integrating proteomic profiles of inflammatory mediators with clinical bioinformatics [7]. In the research by Chen et al., plasma was collected from the healthy persons as controls or from patients with severe pneumonia infected by bacteria or from patients with severe pneumonia-associated ARDS on day of the admission, day 3, and day 7 [3]. Expression of GPC3 in peripheral circulation of severe pneumonia-associated ARDS patients progressively increased over time (admission day, day 3, day 7) compared with healthy persons or severe pneumonia patients alone. The investigators further showed that circulating levels of GPC3 were increased in ARDS induced by severe pneumonia as a model of infection-dominated disease, as well as in ARDS induced by acute pancreatitis as a model of non-infection-based disease. It seems that altered GPC3 may be more dependent upon the disease stage and severity, rather than the properties of associated pathogens or initiates. In acute liver injury models induced by lipopolysaccharide, expression of GPC3 genes increased over time after induction, and even more significantly when bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted [31].",

Based on the known GPC3-related signaling pathways [32\u201334], we propose a possible hypothesis that the GPC3-Wnt pathway may play a significant role in the development and progression of ARDS (Fig. 2). GPC3 has opposite effects on the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, suppressing canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling while activating non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Wnt/JNK) [18]. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway can induce transformation of mesenchymal stem cells to alveolar epithelial cells [35]. Thus, a suppression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by GPC3 may destroy cell integrity, change alveolar epithelial permeability, and aggravate lung edema. On the other hand, an enhancement of Wnt/JNK signaling pathway caused by GPC3 may induce NF-\u03baB activation, which is a classic proinflammatory transcription factor in many inflammatory diseases including ARDS [36]. We therefore hypothesize that GPC3 may be involved in the tissue/cell-associated auto-defensive processes, repair and recovery, or regeneration.\n",

The potential of GPC3 as a disease biomarker needs further study in different diseases in particular in lung diseases, such as ARDS, and in cancers including lung and liver cancer. These studies should involve large cohorts with a variety of disease durations and severity, and in the case of ARDS, of inducing factors. The biological functions and roles of GPC3 require further investigation to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning the associations of GPC3 with disease.
