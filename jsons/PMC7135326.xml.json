            "text": "Identifying individuals infected with the influenza viruses, specifically those at risk for adverse outcomes secondary to infection, is paramount in limiting the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. Due to the extensive variability of influenza symptoms, and that the influenza virus circulates concurrently with other respiratory viruses, the emergency physician must be acutely aware of influenza mimics and their evaluation and treatment 97, 98.1.The assessment of a patient presenting with fever, headache, chills, myalgias, sore throat, and influenza-like symptoms (or in the case of the pediatric patient: decreased appetite, decreased per os tolerance, or decreased urinary output) begins with evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation (3). A definitive airway should be obtained in all toxic-appearing patients with signs of impending airway compromise including stridor, \u201chot potato voice,\u201d trismus, seated in the tripod position, or in those presenting with an inability to protect their airway (altered mental status) (70). An assessment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria should be performed, and diagnostic testing ordered as appropriate, given the physician's clinical suspicion regarding the etiology of the systemic illness. Potential studies include a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, urinalysis, chest x-ray study, blood cultures, and lactate. If sepsis is suspected, the provider should initiate fluid resuscitation to improve peripheral perfusion and administer broad-spectrum antimicrobials 44, 45, 46, 98.2.After initial resuscitation and stabilization of the toxic-appearing patient, a focused history and examination allows for the development of a differential diagnosis based on targeted questioning regarding immunization status, medical comorbidities, daily medication use, sexual practices, and recent travel (e.g., high-risk areas for mosquito-borne illness, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South/Central America). A determination regarding the requirement for adjunct testing and advanced imaging (point-of-care blood glucose, respiratory viral panel, serology, peripheral smear, head noncontrast computed tomography [CT], abdomen/pelvis CT) can then be made.3.In the nontoxic, immunocompetent adolescent or adult patient, the clinical diagnosis of influenza is accurate in up to 90% of cases 23, 24, 97. Patients, or caregivers of patients older than 1 month of age, presenting for evaluation and treatment within 48 h of symptoms onset should be counseled about the benefits (reduced duration of illness up to 1.6 days), and common side effects (gastrointestinal upset) of antiviral therapy 31, 32, 33, 35.4.In patients at high risk for complications secondary to influenza infection (e.g., elderly [50 years and older], immunosuppressed, health care workers, pregnant females; detailed in Table 3), confirmatory testing for influenza should be performed. RIDT has a sensitivity of 50%\u201370% and specificity > 90%, and testing should be interpreted in terms of the community prevalence of influenza infection 9, 26. The utility of performing direct immunofluorescence and RT-PCR testing in the ED may be limited by required laboratory processing times (1\u20138 h) 9, 26. RT-PCR is recognized as the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of influenza 28, 29, 30, 97.\n",

Given the significant overlap in the presenting signs and symptoms of influenza and influenza mimics, and the plethora of infectious and noninfectious influenza mimics, the emergency physician must be able to quickly identify patients as toxic-appearing or non\u2013toxic-appearing, perform initial resuscitation as appropriate, and collect an adequate history and perform a physical examination to determine necessary methods for patient evaluation and treatment.Article Summary\n1. Why is this topic important?Influenza and upper respiratory infections account for a large amount of emergency department (ED) presentations. However, many critical conditions can present with similar symptoms.\n2. What does this review attempt to show?This review evaluates influenza symptoms and diagnosis, while discussing mimics and an approach to evaluation and management.\n3. What are the key findings?Influenza can present with a variety of symptoms, and providers demonstrate a diagnostic accuracy approaching 90% in the correct setting. Rapid antigen detection can be useful in the ED, and treatment is warranted for several populations within 48 h of symptom onset. Approximately 70% of patients with influenza-like symptoms are experiencing a mimic. Several of these conditions that mimic the presentation of influenza require rapid management.\n4. How is patient care impacted?This evaluation of influenza and its mimics discusses the presentation, diagnosis, and management of influenza, while detailing the presentation and diagnosis of several deadly conditions requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\n",
