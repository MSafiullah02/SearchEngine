Antiviral drugs and vaccines are used to fight viral infections in human (De Clercq and Li, 2016, Marston et al., 2014). Previously, there has been a focus on \u201cone drug, one virus\u201d dogma, which relied on targeting virus-specific factors. A counterpoint to this is the \u201cone drug, multiple viruses\u201d paradigm, which came with the discovery of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs), small-molecules that inhibit a wide range of human viruses (Bekerman and Einav, 2015, de Clercq and Montgomery, 1983, Debing et al., 2015, Ianevski et al., 2019, Rada and Dragun, 1977, Sidwell et al., 1972). This paradigm was based on the observation that different viruses utilize similar pathways and host factors to replicate inside a cell (Bosl et al., 2019). Although the concept of BSAAs has been around for almost 50 years, the field received a new impetus with recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Dengue, influenza and other viral infections, the discovery of novel host-directed agents, as well as development of drug repositioning methodology.",

This has significant advantages over new drug discovery since chemical synthesis steps, manufacturing processes, reliable safety, and pharmacokinetic properties in pre-clinical (animal model) and early clinical developmental phases (phase 0, I and IIa) are already available (Figure 1\n). Therefore, repositioning of launched or even failed drugs to viral diseases provides unique translational opportunities, including a substantially higher probability of success to market as compared with developing new virus-specific drugs and vaccines, and a significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability (Ianevski et al., 2019, Pizzorno et al., 2019, Zheng et al., 2018).",

Immortalized cancerous cell cultures and co-cultures, which express appropriate viral receptors, are most commonly used in this first step. The half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) for a compound are calculated based on their dose-response curves obtained on mock-infected cells. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) are calculated based on the analysis of curves obtained on infected cells. Statistical analyses can help to determine if the differences between CC50 and EC50 are significant, given the inherent variability of the experiment (Meneghini and Hamasaki, 1967). A relative effectiveness of a drug is defined as selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50).",

For example, TZM-bl cells expressing firefly luciferase under control of HIV-1 LTR promoter allowed quantitation of BSAA action on HIV-1 infection (tat-protein expression by integrated HIV-1 provirus) using firefly luciferase assay (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014, Xing et al., 2016). RFP-expressing RVFV, nanoLuc-expressing CHIKV and RRV, as well as GFP-expressing FLUAV, HCV and HMPV also allowed identification of novel activities of several BSAAs (Andersen et al., 2019b, Bosl et al., 2019, de Graaf et al., 2007, Habjan et al., 2008, Ianevski et al., 2018, Jupille et al., 2011, Kittel et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2017, Utt et al., 2016). In addition, qPCR/RT-qPCR, RNA/DNA sequencing, RNA/DNA hybridization, immuno- and plaque assays as well as CRISPR-Cas9 systems could be used for detection of inhibitory effects of BSAAs (Boonham et al., 2014, Fischer et al., 2017, Konig et al., 2019, Laamiri et al., 2018, Landry, 1990, Perez et al., 2013, Sashital, 2018, Zhou et al., 2018). Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas9, siRNA and shRNA approaches were used for identification of BSAA targets (Deans et al., 2016, Puschnik et al., 2017).",

Thereby, novel antiviral activities of BSAAs should be further validated in primary human cells using different viral strains (including wild-type viruses), different viral loads, different times of compound addition, different endpoint measurements and compound concentration range. Primary cell cultures give more accurate images of drug responses (Alves et al., 2018, Denisova et al., 2012, Koban et al., 2018, Postnikova et al., 2018).

ESCs are isolated from surplus human embryos, whereas iPSCs are obtained by reprogramming somatic cells. These cells proliferate extensively and retain multi-lineage activity, which allows them to generate virtually any cell type of the body. The ESCs- and iPSC-derived cells have been used successfully to investigate the efficacy of several BSAAs against HBV, ZIKV, CHIKV and HSV-1 infections (Table S1) (Ferreira et al., 2019, Iwasawa et al., 2019, Lanko et al., 2017, Simonin et al., 2019, Xia et al., 2017, Zhou et al., 2017).",

            "text": "In vitro and ex vivo models do not fully reflect the complexity and physiology of living organisms. Therefore, several in vivo models have been developed to test novel antiviral activities of BSAAs. These include immunocompetent and genetically or chemically immunocompromised mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, pigs, macaques and other animals (Figure 2B) (Alves et al., 2018, Haese et al., 2016, Louz et al., 2013, Morrison and Diamond, 2017, Taylor, 2017, Thangavel and Bouvier, 2014). PK/PD studies determine drug absorption, dosage and half-life of BSAAs. Toxicological studies determine if the drugs have any adverse effects on the tissues and organs of the animals and define the dosage of adverse effects (Alabaster and In Vivo Pharmacology Training Group, 2002, Parasuraman, 2011, Rizk et al., 2017). Studying the efficacy of BSAAs is generally done by treating the animal with the drug or vehicle and infecting it with a virus of interest. Endpoints are usually body weight/ mortality (depending on the virus), histopathology, virus titers in organs, presence of clinical signs and development of immunity (Oh and Hurt, 2016, Smee and Barnard, 2013). Although animal models can give the initial characterization of BSAA, it is important to keep in mind that they differ significantly from humans, with respect to symptoms, disease manifestation, susceptibility, immune responses, pathogenesis, and pharmacokinetics (Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Montagutelli, 2015, Shanks et al., 2009).",

Imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and dasatinib, which inhibit tyrosine kinases, are the most abundant host-directed BSAAs. Most of the host targets (except Bcl-xL protein) are essential for viral replication but redundant for the cell, which is critical for reducing putative toxicities associated with blocking cellular pathways.
