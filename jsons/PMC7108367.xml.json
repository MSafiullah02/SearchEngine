            "text": "Gastrointestinal disorders represent a major cause of economic losses in the Swiss pig production [1]. Several bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens have been described as cause of infectious diarrhoea in pigs, having often an age-related occurrence. In suckling piglets, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Isospora (syn. Cystoisospora) suis, Rotavirus, Coronavirus and Clostridium perfringens type C are regarded as the most relevant causes of diarrhoea worldwide [2]. Under certain management conditions (e.g. outdoor-housing), the nematode Strongyloides ransomi may also play an important role as cause of diarrhoea in suckling piglets [3], [4]. In weaned and fattening piglets, gastrointestinal diseases are commonly caused by E. coli, Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Porcine Circovirus Type 2, Coronavirus and nematodes such as Ascaris suum, Oesophagostomum spp. and Trichuris suis\n[2], [4]. Gastrointestinal parasites can be cause of economic losses by production of diarrhoea but also by organ condemnation (e.g. \u201cmilk spots\u201d in the liver caused by A. suum), reduction of carcass quality, reduced feed conversion and daily weight gain and by potentiating other pathogens [2], [4]. Parasites commonly detected in suckling piglets include mainly those species with short life cycles such as I. suis and S. ransomi. While I. suis is currently recognized as an important cause of diarrhoea in suckling piglets worldwide [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], S. ransomi seems to be less important in modern intensive pig production [10], [11], [12]. Weaners and fatteners are less frequently infected with I. suis\n[13], [14], [15]. In those age categories, Oesophagostomum spp., A. suum and T. suis appear to play a more important role, especially when pigs are housed outdoors [11], [12], [16]. Cryptosporidium spp. were described in pigs of all ages worldwide [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Cryptosporidium infections in pigs are usually subclinical but sometimes they are cause of non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Moreover, some Cryptosporidium spp. are important due to their zoonotic potential [23]. Amoebae and Balantidium coli seem to be common parasites in all age groups but they have a low clinical relevance [4], [13], [24].",

            "text": "In Switzerland, the conventional pig husbandry consists in indoor housing, with an optional outdoor area, generally with concrete floor, with or without a perforated area. A complete slatted floor is just allowed until 31st August 2018, therefore the farms are changing to partially slatted floor. Concerning the animal welfare, straw, hay, plastic- or chain-toys are obligatory in all pig pens. The higher percentage of non-perforated concrete floor leads to a higher accumulation of faecal rests in the pens, enhancing the likelihood of parasite infection. Moreover, the straw, hay or green fodder may be also potentially contaminated with parasite stages. There are only few data about the occurrence of endoparasites in Swiss piglets and their importance as cause of disease. Mundt et al. detected I. suis infections in 2\u20133 week-old piglets in 69% of 13 Swiss farms, most of them reporting diarrhoea in this age group [25]. Eichhorn investigated weaned piglets and fatteners from 90 conventional and 20 free-range farms in Switzerland by the sedimentation/zinc-chloride flotation method and observed that 32.2% of the conventional farms were positive for T. suis, 13.3% for A. suum, 3.3% for Strongylida and 1.1% for S. ransomi\n[26]. Besides, T. suis was detected in 60% of 20 tested free-range pig farms, A. suum in 35%, Metastrongylus sp. in 30%, Strongylida in 20% and S. ransomi in 5% of those farms. Interestingly, diarrhoea was present in only 9.4% (3 of 32) conventional farms with positive parasitological diagnosis and in none of the free-range farms, but in 32.8% (19 of 58) of the farms with negative parasitological results [26].",

Farms fulfilling determined criteria (i.e. recurrent or therapy-resistant diseases of unknown origin, atypical clinical signs, increased morbidity or mortality rates and increased use of antibiotics) were encouraged to submit affected animals (1 to max. 3/farm) for subsidized diagnosis. Based on necropsy findings, selected laboratory investigations (e.g. histopathological, bacteriological, virological and parasitological studies) were performed to assess the cause of the problem. Necropsies and further laboratory diagnosis were subsidized by FSVO (up to CHF 200 per submitted animal or up to CHF 500 per farm submitting three animals) and thereby in most of the cases free of charge for the farmer [1].",

For example, a bacteriological investigation was performed to all animals with a history of diarrhoea and/or liquid faecal consistency in the large intestine, mostly directed to the identification of ETEC. The obtained E. coli pure isolates (isolated under aerobic conditions from Columbia blood agar with sheep blood, Oxoid AG, Pratteln, Switzerland) were further analysed by serotyping using different antisera (F4; F5; O141:K85 and O139:K82, Sifin Diagnostics GmbH, Berlin, Germany). If haemorrhagic enteritis in suckling piglets was observed, culture of Clostridium perfringens Type C from the faeces out of the small intestine was done (Columbia blood agar with sheep blood, Oxoid AG, Pratteln, Switzerland, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h under anaerobic conditions). Detection of the target genes for the toxins \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b22 was done using real-time multiplex PCR [30]. Diarrheic piglets with a negative bacteriological result or sometimes parallel to the bacteriological investigation were tested by immunochromatography for Rotavirus A (FASTest\u00ae ROTA Strip Megacor, H\u00f6rbranz, Austria) and porcine Coronaviruses (Anigen Rapid TGE/PED Ag Test kit BioNote, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). A histopathological examination of the intestines was performed if no signs of autolysis were present, mostly in recently euthanized animals and only sporadically in animals which died on the farm. Lesions suggestive for Brachyspira spp. infection were never detected at necropsy and specific bacteriological diagnosis (culture followed by subsequent PCR detection [31]) was only performed by request of the submitting veterinarian. In wasting pigs, ileum and lymphatic organs were always histopathologically investigated for lesions of infection with L. intracellularis and PCV2 respectively. L. intracelularis was intralesional demonstrated with Warthin-Starry silver nitrate-based stain and PCV2 was detected by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody F217 [32].

Probably due to the small number of samples from pigs without diarrhoea, this difference was not significant. While several studies in suckling piglets involving a large amount of litters or farms reported a significant association between the presence of I. suis oocysts in the faeces and diarrhoea [5], [7], [8], experimental infections of piglets with I. suis showed a great individual variation in oocyst shedding and clinical outcome [33], [34], [35]. Interestingly, it was observed that the peaks of oocysts excretion and diarrhoea frequently do not occur at the same time [33], [34], [35]. In the current study, we had the limitation, that individual faecal samples from 1 to 3 animals/farm were examined instead of faecal pools from whole litters or several litters/farm as in most epidemiological studies; therefore, we can assume that the chances to diagnose I. suis-associated diarrhoea in a farm were lower than in other studies. It is possible that in some of the animals submitted for diagnosis the peak of oocysts excretion had occurred before the onset of diarrhoea or that the diarrhoea had impaired the detection of oocysts due to the dilution of the faeces [24], [36]. Considering all examined pigs (with and without diarrhoea) in the current study, the prevalence for I. suis was 12.8% in suckling piglets, 6.7% in weaners and 7.7% in fatteners. In Europe, some estimated prevalences at the animal level for I. suis infection in piglets were: Germany: 10% [13]; Denmark: 19.5%; Finland: 4.5%; Iceland: 31.8%; Norway: 0.3%; Sweden: 20.1% [12]. When considering the results at the farm level, it has to be taken into account that a large number of farms, but only up to three animals/farm were analysed in this study. Therefore, we can assume that the real prevalences might be even higher. However, despite of the small amount of animals/farm analysed, the occurrence of I. suis was revealed in 8.1% of the farms, showing the high frequency of occurrence in Switzerland. In nationwide surveys carried out in Germany, Austria and Switzerland one decade ago, I. suis was detected in 77.8% of 135 herds with diarrhoea and in 37.5% of 8 herds without diarrhoea (at least 5 different pooled litters/farm were tested) [25]. [8]. In the Netherlands, I. suis was detected in suckling piglets from 41 of 113 (53%) litters from 17 of 25 farms (68%) [10]. Further, I. suis infections are also known to cause decreased daily weight gain and uneven weaning weights [24], [25], [36]. Accordingly, in this study it was observed that I. suis infections were significantly associated with emaciation and were less frequent in well-fed animals.",

Most of the B. coli infections in pigs are subclinical, and usually limited to the intestinal lumen but in some cases, usually after injures of the intestinal wall by other agents, the trophozoites can penetrate in the mucosa causing necrosis and haemorrhages mostly in colon and caecum resulting in diarrhoea, bloody faeces, tenesmus, and even death [4], [37]. Moreover, B. coli has zoonotic potential and several cases of human infection transmitted by pigs were reported worldwide [38]. In this study, B. coli was commonly observed by coproscopy, however a histopathological examination is needed in order to enable any clinical association. In 10 animals with positive coproscopy, from which histopathological examination of the large intestine was performed, no association of this parasites with intestinal lesions could be observed. However, as in the frame of the PathoPig project the histopathological examination of the large intestine was not systematically performed to all animals, the involvement of B. coli in some clinical cases cannot be completely excluded.",

Interestingly, both B. coli and amoebae were significant more frequently detected in pigs without diarrhoea. The lower frequency of detections in pigs with diarrhoea might be the result of a dilution effect on the parasite burden caused by the high water content of diarrhoeic faeces. Damriyasa and Bauer also reported an age- related increasing of B. coli and amoebae infections [13]. They examined 514 suckling and weaned piglets (age up to 7 weeks) in Germany, and 21% were positive for B. coli, 14% for Entamoeba sp. and 10% for Iodamoeba sp. In contrast, Wieler et al. [14] investigating 287 suckling and weaned piglets with diarrhoea in Germany found B. coli in only 0.7% of the animals. This difference might have been at least in part, due to the different diagnostic sensitivity of the detection methods used: Wieler et al. [14] used MIF (merthiolate iodine formalin concentration technique) whereas Damriyasa and Bauer [13] and the current study used the SAFC method.",

In this study, Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 10.3% of the suckling piglets, 15.0% of the weaned pigs and in 19.2% of the fatteners. According to several authors, the most common Cryptosporidium spp. in pigs are the host-specific genotypes C. suis and C. scrofarum (previously Cryptosporidium pig genotype II), however the zoonotic species C. parvum has been also occasionally found [17], [19], [23], [24], [39], [40]. In this study, only two species of Cryptosporidium could be identified by molecular analysis: C. suis in piglets aged 6 weeks or younger and C. scrofarum in animals aged 6 weeks or older. This age-related difference was also observed in recent epidemiological studies, in which C. suis was predominantly found in young or pre-weaned piglets and C. scrofarum (or Cryptosporidium pig genotype II) in older animals [19], [21], [22], [23], [41]. Experimentally, piglets inoculated with C. scrofarum at 4-weeks of age remained uninfected, whereas only 5-week-old and older animals were fully susceptible to infection [42]. Cryptosporidiosis in pigs does not always result in clinical signs and the species of Cryptosporidium involved could play a significant role. While in experimental studies, piglets inoculated with Cryptosporidium-oocysts derived from calves (most likely C. parvum) developed depression, anorexia and gastrointestinal signs [43], [44], infections with Cryptosporidium hominis, C. suis, or Cryptosporidium pig genotype II were shown to be less severe [43], [44], [45], [46].",

            "text": "In this study, Cryptosporidium infections (when considered at the genus level) were significantly more frequent in pigs without diarrhoea (30%) than in pigs with diarrhoea (7.1%). A lack of association between diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium oocysts shedding in pigs was observed in several studies [19], [39], [41], [47]. However, other studies observed an association between diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium infection in suckling piglets [48] or between the occurrence of diarrhoea and the level of oocysts shedding within infected pig groups [20]. In addition, co-infections with I. suis or Rotavirus can increase the severity of clinical signs [24], [43]. After molecular characterization of the Cryptosporidium isolates, we observed that none of the pigs infected with C. scrofarum (n\n = 8) had diarrhoea; whilst diarrhoea was present in three out of four piglets infected with C. suis. However, two of these piglets were co- infected with I. suis and one with B. coli. Although the number of analysed samples is small, this would be in agreement with the study from Hamnes et al. [48] in Norway, which suggested that C. suis infections may contribute to diarrhoea in suckling piglets whilst animals infected with Cryptosporidium pig genotype II (syn. C. scrofarum) may not develop clinical signs. Regarding the zoonotic risk, the relevance of pigs as a source for Cryptosporidium infections for humans is apparently limited [24]. The zoonotic species C. parvum is not highly prevalent in pigs and the pig-adapted species are not frequently detected in humans. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of C. suis infections have been reported both in immunocompromised [49], [50], [51] and in immunocompetent humans worldwide [29], [52]. Moreover, infections with C. scrofarum have been also detected in immunocompetent humans [53].",

However, A. suum and T. suis were also very rarely detected in weaners and fatteners, appearing not to be common parasites in the set of pigs analysed in this study. Also Strongylida-eggs were seldom found in the examined pigs.

ETEC infections were found to be involved in around 44% of the cases with gastrointestinal problems. However, in the frame of PathoPig project not all animals were systematically tested against all possible infectious agents. Complementary tests were decided by the pathologists based on anamnesis data and/or necropsy findings and parasites were a priori only seldom suspected as cause of disease at necropsy, therefore, coproscopical examinations were only rarely ordered as complementary diagnostic methods by the pathologists. According to the 2014 year's report, parasites seemed to be negligible as cause of gastrointestinal problems in Swiss pigs. Only in two farms each, I. suis and T. suis infections were recognized as cause of disease [27]. However, in the frame of this parallel study on a subset of those samples, all piglets were systematically tested by three coproscopical methods independently of the initial suspicion of parasitic disease, revealing a higher frequency of parasitic infections that in some cases could have contributed to the observed clinical signs.",
