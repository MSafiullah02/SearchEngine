We compared cleavage of ZEBOV-, SEBOV-, CIEBOV-, and REBOV-GP in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T and in EpoNi/22.1 kidney cells derived from E. buettikoferi, a member of the same bat genus as the potential EBOV reservoir species E. franqueti (the EpoNi/22.1 cell line was chosen because of reasonable transfection efficiency, compared with other bat cell lines tested). For this, we transfected the cell lines with expression plasmids encoding EBOV-GPs equipped with a C-terminal V5-tag and assessed GP cleavage by Western blot. If GP is efficiently cleaved, mainly the transmembrane unit GP2 should be detected, whereas if cleavage is inefficient, mainly the precursor protein GP0 should be detected. Expression of all GPs was detected in transfected 293T and EpoNi/22.1 cells (Figure 1), although expression in the latter cells was less efficient, as a result of reduced transfection efficiency (70%\u201380% for 293T cells vs 20%\u201330% for EpoNi/22.1 cells). Expression efficiency among GPs varied, with ZEBOV-GP and SEBOV-GP being more robustly expressed than CIEBOV-GP and REBOV-GP (Figure 1). All GPs were cleaved in 293T and EpoNi/22.1 cells, and no difference in cleavage efficiency was apparent between these cell lines. However, marked differences in cleavage efficiency were observed between EBOV-GPs. Thus, ZEBOV- and SEBOV-GP were almost fully cleaved, whereas a large proportion of CIEBOV- and particularly REBOV-GP remained uncleaved (Figure 1). In sum, GP cleavage does not seem to differ between the tested bat and human cells and only the GPs derived from ZEBOV and SEBOV are cleaved efficiently.",

Expression of VP40 alone is sufficient to induce release of virus-like particles, and release can be augmented by coexpression of GP [12\u201315]. We investigated whether GP enhanced the release of VP40 from human 293T cells and bat EpoNi/22.1 cells. Expression and release of VP40 was detectable in both 293T and EpoNi/22.1 cells. The generation of 2 forms of VP40 was likely due to use of an internal AUG codon in the VP40 open reading frame [15]. Coexpression of VP40 with EBOV-GPs augmented the release of VP40 relative to that in cells transfected with empty plasmid instead of a GP-encoding plasmid (Mock), despite the presence of comparable amounts of GP in cell lysates (Figure 2). Thus, GP might augment particle release in infected humans and bats, and the ability to augment release seems to be conserved between the GPs of all EBOV species.",

The ability to induce cell rounding and detachment correlated with the viral pathogenicity in humans, with ZEBOV- and SEBOV-GP but not REBOV-GP being able to efficiently trigger rounding of GP-expressing cells [18]. We assessed whether GP expression induced detachment of 293T and EpoNi/22.1 cells. Quantification of cells present in the supernatant of transfected cultures showed that ZEBOV-GP, SEBOV-GP, and REBOV-GP were able to induce detachment of 293T cells, whereas CIEBOV-GP was inactive (Figure 3A). In EpoNi/22.1 cells, detachment was observed upon expression of all GPs tested, with ZEBOV-GP being most active (Figure 3B). Because the results obtained for 293T cells did not match those previously published [17], we asked whether differences in GP expression levels might be the cause. To investigate this, we cloned all EBOV-GP sequences in commonly used pcDNA plasmids and compared GP expression by pcDNA plasmids (used in the previous study) with expression by pCAGGS plasmids [30], which have been used throughout the present study. Expression of REBOV-GP and CIEBOV-GP upon transfection of pcDNA plasmids was barely detectable, whereas expression of these GPs was readily detected in cells transfected with pCAGGS plasmids (Figure 3C). Notably, when cell detachment was analyzed with the pcDNA plasmids containing GP, ZEBOV-GP and SEBOV-GP were active whereas REBOV-GP was not (Figure 3D), in agreement with published data [17, 18]. These results show that GP-induced cellular detachment does not differ markedly between human and bat cells. In addition, our findings suggest that previously noted differences between the ability of ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP to induce cell rounding might have been due to differences in expression levels.",

In HeLa cells, ZEBOV-GP and REBOV-GP were mainly located at the cell surface and to a lesser extent within intracellular compartments (Figure 4A). GP was also detected at the cell surface of EpoNi/22.1 cells, but intracellular localization was more prominent, compared with that in HeLa cells (Figure 4). In addition, accumulation of GP in intracellular compartments was frequently detected in EpoNi/22.1 cells (Figure 4). However, this phenotype was not unique to EpoNi/22.1 cells but was also observed for potential reservoir cells, generated from H. monstrosus, and for nonreservoir cells, generated from M. daubentonii (Figure 4B). Finally, VP40 was found at the plasma membrane and distributed in the cellular cytoplasm in all cell lines tested (Figures 4A and 4B). Collectively, there were no substantial differences in VP40 localization in human and reservoir cells, whereas plasma membrane localization of GP was more prominent in human than in reservoir cells.",

Using VSV-based pseudotypes bearing EBOV-GPs, we assessed whether susceptibility of bats to filovirus infection may be restricted at the stage of viral entry. For this, infectivity-normalized VSV pseudotypes bearing VSV-G or EBOV-GPs were used for infection of bat cell lines. Pseudotypes bearing neither VSV-G nor EBOV-GP served as negative controls. Infectious entry of VSV-G\u2013bearing control pseudotypes into all cell lines tested was readily measurable. ZEBOV-, SEBOV-, and REBOV-GP\u2013driven infection of EpoNi/22.1 and HypNi/1.1 cells was also detected (Figure 5A). The latter were obtained from the potential reservoir species H. monstrosus. In general, the infectivity of pseudotypes was relatively low, and we suspected that the C-terminal V5 tag might be incompatible with efficient GP incorporation into VSV particles. We therefore used VSV pseudotypes bearing untagged ZEBOV-GP to clarify whether susceptibility to ZEBOV-GP\u2013dependent entry is a characteristic of cells from reservoir species. These pseudotypes were indeed more infectious for the control cell lines Vero E6 and BHK-21 than were their counterparts with a V5-tag (data not shown), and infection of cells derived from the potential reservoir species H. monstrosus and R. aegyptiacus [23] and nonreservoir bat species M. daubentonii was readily detectable (Figure 5B), indicating that receptor-GP interactions might not limit the susceptibility of bat species to EBOV infection.",

For this, cells were inoculated with ZEBOV and washed, and the median tissue culture infective dose of supernatants was determined at different points after infection. The virus replicated with high efficiency and similar kinetics in EpoNi/22.1 and HypNi/1.1 cells, and replication in these cell lines was faster, compared with that in Vero E6 cells.

In contrast to GP cleavage by cathepsins, GP processing by furin was found to be dispensable for viral spread in cell culture [10] and in animals [11], and the biological relevance of GP cleavage by furin is at present unclear. The EBOV-GPs tested here were cleaved in human and bat cells with similar efficiency, indicating that a bat homolog of furin processes EBOV-GP with efficiency comparable to that of its human counterpart. However, processing of the GPs of ZEBOV and SEBOV was clearly more efficient than cleavage of the GPs of CIEBOV and REBOV. The decreased cleavability of REBOV-GP was expected, because 2 arginines present in the furin consensus site of ZEBOV-, SEBOV-, and CIEBOV-GP are replaced by lysines in REBOV-GP [37].

It can be speculated that tetherin could inhibit EBOV spread in the host and, in agreement with this hypothesis, we found that tetherin counteraction was conserved among all EBOV-GPs tested (Supplementary Figure 1). Antagonism of human tetherin by EBOV-GPs was much more pronounced in human, compared with bat, cells (Supplementary Figure 1), suggesting that the latter might lack a cofactor required for tetherin counteraction by EBOV-GP. Whether tetherin homologs are expressed in bat cells and exhibit antiviral function remains to be examined.",

            "text": "Sequences of EBOV have so far been detected in only 3 fruit bat species, H. monstrosus,E. franqueti, and M. torquata. Several parameters might determine permissiveness of bats to EBOV infection, one being GP interactions with receptors on the surface of host cells. Our results suggest that ZEBOV-, SEBOV-, and REBOV-GP can mediate entry into cells from potential reservoir species, which is remarkable for REBOV, because the virus should be adapted to Asian reservoir hosts, potentially also bats. In addition, our findings show that susceptibility to EBOV-GP\u2013driven infection is not a feature unique to cells from potential reservoir species, in agreement with a previous study [41], indicating that GP-receptor interactions do not limit the susceptibility of bat species for EBOV infection. Notably, the bat cell lines tested here were highly permissive to EBOV replication and can be used to study interactions of EBOV with cells derived from potential reservoir species. However, it remains to be examined whether they adequately model EBOV infection of primary cells or cells from other organs of potential reservoir species. In sum, EBOV-GP\u2013mediated host cell entry does not limit EBOV infection to certain bat species, and cell lines from potential bat reservoir species can allow efficient EBOV replication. The latter finding is in agreement with a recent report revealing that Marburg virus readily replicates in a cell line established from the fruit bat R. aegyptiacus [36], a suspected reservoir host [42].",
