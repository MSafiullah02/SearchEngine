The problem is particularly acute among young children, who will have an estimated 15 episodes of diarrhea in the first five years of life1 and among whom 2.5 million deaths will occur each year.2 For up to half of all episodes, an etiologic agent cannot be found. The importance of viral agents as causes of diarrheal disease has been increasingly appreciated, beginning with the discovery of rotavirus3 and caliciviruses4 in the 1970s. More recently, advances in detection methods for some other viruses, such as astroviruses and enteric adenoviruses, have led us to appreciate their role as causes of diarrheal disease. In addition, a variety of other viruses, such as picobirnaviruses, coronaviruses, and toroviruses, have been associated with gastroenteritis, but their clinical and public health importance remains unclear (Table 63-1\n). Many of these viruses may be responsible for the fraction of illness for which a pathogen cannot be found and a better understanding of their epidemiology will have implications for programs to decrease morbidity and mortality in developing countries.",

Since 1990, improvements in diagnostic methods, including the adaptation of astrovirus to grow in continuous cell lines7; sequencing and elucidation of the structure of the genome8, 9, 10; and development of improved methods of detection, including enzyme immumoassays and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction,11, 12, 13, 14 have led to new insights into the role of astrovirus in human disease. It is now clear that astroviruses are a common cause of sporadic gastroenteritis among children, possibly second only to rotavirus, and may be associated with large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea as well.",

In temperate climates, astrovirus diarrhea cases peak in winter,17,\n19,\n24,\n29,\n31 whereas the seasonality is less clear in tropical settings.32,\n44,\n46 With improvements in detection methods, astrovirus represents an important cause of community-acquired and nosocomial illness and may be the most common viral cause of gastroenteritis in children after rotavirus and possibly Norwalk-like viruses.19 In developing countries, astroviruses have generally been detected in less than 10% of young children treated for gastroenteritis in outpatient clinics or in hospitals, and the lower proportions reported from some studies (<1%\u20133%) may reflect insensitive detection methods rather than true prevalence.19,\n21,\n42,\n45,\n47, 48, 49, 50 Even so, one study in rural Mexico has found astrovirus to be the most common cause of diarrhea in the first three years of life, causing 26% of diarrheal episodes in a prospectively followed cohort.32 Outbreaks of astrovirus gastroenteritis have been reported in schools,36,\n37 day-care centers,25,\n51,\n52 hospitals,26,\n29,\n39,\n53,\n54 nursing homes,38,\n40 and households.32,\n55 Nosocomial spread of astroviruses may be common.56 While the modes of transmission are still unknown, the primary mode of spread of virus is likely to be through fecal\u2013oral contamination via person-to-person contact,33,\n35,\n36,\n53 although the stability of the virus in water may indicate that waterborne spread is possible.57\n",

But unlike the common respiratory adenoviruses, enteric adenoviruses were difficult to grow and were therefore distinguished as the fastidious enteric adenoviruses (FEAs). Eventually, these FEAs were placed in their own group and found to belong to two predominant serotypes, 40 and 41. Besides these serotypes, only serotype 31 has occasionally been causally associated with gastroenteritis. Like astroviruses, the development of rapid, sensitive diagnostic assays for the detection of EAs has increased our appreciation of their role as causes of diarrhea in children.",

In studies that have compared rates of HECV detection in stools from patients with diarrhea versus controls, the results are mixed. Because of the long duration of shedding and the possibility for asymptomatic infection, the pathogenicity of HECVs may be difficult to prove by comparing rates of detection between well and ill persons.
