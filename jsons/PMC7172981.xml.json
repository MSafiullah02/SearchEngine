Asthma may be caused by allergic responses, and COPD is highly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke (CS), however both diseases may be exacerbated by viral or bacteria infections. In fact, both asthma and COPD are among the top 10 most devastating diseases in the world caused by infectious agents, in terms of loss of life and overall morbidity (Mizgerd, 2006). Despite this importance, both diseases feature distinct clinical phenotypes which are inadequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroid (GC) based therapies, the mainstay therapy for both diseases. The identification of new therapeutic targets therefore remains a research priority for both diseases.",

Strikingly, many of the pro-inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules, respiratory mucins, growth and angiogenic factors are induced via the Rel/Nuclear Factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family of transcription factors. This review will provide a timely summary of the literature regarding the importance of NF-\u03baB in asthma and COPD. We will reflect on the various forms of asthma and COPD, including both stable forms and exacerbations of either disease, and discuss the relative roles of NF-\u03baB in each. We will also argue that asthma and COPD are inflammatory diseases, and that targeting the inflammatory pathways via NF-\u03baB inhibition is a realistic and logical strategy for future therapeutic intervention. We also discuss how drugs targeting NF-\u03baB may have distinct advantages over inhaled GCs at least for some phenotypes of asthma or COPD.",

            "text": "Asthma is defined as variable airway obstruction usually accompanied by airway hyperreactivity (AHR). Defining features of asthma include bronchoconstriction due to contraction or hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle (ASM), and inflammation within the airway. These processes lead to decreased lung function, measured either as changes in peak expiratory flow (PEF) over time, or a decrease in forced expiratory volume (FEV) in 1 s following provocation with histamine. Symptoms often include dyspnoea, wheeze and tightening of the chest. In most cases, the immediate effect on lung function can be reversed by a short acting \u03b22 agonist. Asthma is now accepted to be a heterogeneous complex disorder (for a review see Wenzel, 2006), and normally presents as a chronic, stable disease with acute exacerbations, often following acute viral or bacterial infection of the lower airway. Exposure to allergens, and the resulting allergic cascade is also a cause of asthma, and this may work in an additive or synergistic manner with exposure to pollution (Spannhake et al., 2002, Chauhan et al., 2003), or acute respiratory infections (Green et al., 2002).",

In the UK, the cost of asthma exacerbations are 3.5 fold higher per patient compared to stable asthma (Hoskins et al., 2000).

            "text": "Much is known regarding the cells and molecules contributing to asthma. The allergic cascade has been a focal point of research interest for decades. Upon allergen exposure, mast cells within the airway sensitised with allergen specific IgE are triggered to release a number of pre-formed mediators packaged in their granules. The granules contain histamine, which act on ASM and causes the immediate bronchoconstriction of the airway, observed in asthma. Mast cells synthesise prostaglandins, leukotrienes and kinins which can contribute to bronchoconstriction, and are also a source of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which serve to increase class switching to IgE in B cells, and augment the production of various Th2 chemokines from epithelial and ASM cells. IL-13 is also highly associated with airway hyperreactivity in animal models of asthma (Leigh et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). Mast cells also produce various chemokines attracting inflammatory neutrophils, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, and eosinophils into the airway. Th2 lymphocytes are a further source of Th2 cytokines, including IL-5, essential for eosinophil differentiation from bone marrow (for a review, see Renauld, 2001). Recruitment of these various cell types, especially Th2 cells are thought to contribute to the late asthmatic response, (LAR) which features further bronchoconstriction and AHR. In severe asthma, increased ASM proliferation, and fibroblast differentiation may contribute to airway remodelling, causing further long term limitations in lung function via increasing basement membrane thickness, and angiogenesis.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections notably human rhinoviruses (RV) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses and influenza viruses (Johnston et al., 1993, Johnston et al., 1995, Freymuth et al., 1999, Rakes et al., 1999) are responsible for the majority (> 80%) of asthma exacerbations. Atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydiophila pneumoniae are also associated with asthma exacerbations (Thumerelle et al., 2003). Both viral and bacterial infection cause upregulation of a plethora of pro-inflammatory molecules in an NF-\u03baB dependent manner, including neutrophil chemokines IL-8/CXCL8 (Johnston et al., 1997, Zhu et al., 1997, Carter et al., 1998, Pizzichini et al., 1998, Cheon et al., 2008), ENA-78/CXCL5 (Donninger et al., 2003) GRO-\u03b1/CXCL1 (Edwards et al., 2006a), T cell chemokines IP-10/CXCL10 (Spurrell et al., 2005), Rantes/CCL5 (Thomas et al., 1998, Rudd et al., 2005, Veckman et al., 2005), and eotaxin/CCL10 (Papadopoulos et al., 2001). In addition, various cytokines and growth factors are induced, including IL-6 (Zhu et al., 1996, Dallaire et al., 2001, Oliver et al., 2006, Edwards et al., 2007) GM-CSF (Kim et al., 2000, Funkhouser et al., 2004), IL-11 (Einarsson et al., 1996), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Volonaki et al., 2006). Adhesion molecules (Papi and Johnston, 1999a, Papi and Johnston, 1999b, Murdoch et al., 2002), respiratory mucins including MUC5AC (He et al., 2004, Inoue et al., 2006) and MUC5B (Inoue et al., 2006) are also produced. Macrophages, possibly through recognition of viral and bacterial products including single stranded RNA (ssRNA), double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produce TNF-\u03b1 (Laza-Stanca et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2008, Oliver et al., 2008), a highly inflammatory cytokine serving to maintain the pro-inflammatory environment within the airway, and is a further inducer of neutrophil and T cell attracting chemokines. Viral induced asthma exacerbations in asthmatic individuals therefore have all the cellular hallmarks one would expect from the production of the above mediators, and commonly feature increased levels of airway eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (Fraenkel et al., 1995, Grunberg et al., 1997, Pizzichini et al., 1998, Message et al., 2008). Both experimental human and mouse models of rhinovirus induced asthma exacerbations have recently been developed (Bartlett et al., 2008, Message et al., 2008, Newcomb et al., 2008).",

While very effective in treating stable asthma they are less effective in treating exacerbations (Pauwels et al., 1997, FitzGerald et al., 2004). The allergic response has been an intense focus for therapeutic intervention, culminating in clinical trials using IL-4, IL-5 and IgE as therapeutic targets. Anti-IgE therapy appears partially effective (Bousquet et al., 2004, Holgate et al., 2004), particularly in severe asthma. The outcomes of trials with both soluble IL-4 receptors and humanised anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies however have been disappointing (Borish et al., 1999, Leckie et al., 2000, Borish et al., 2001, Kips et al., 2003, O'Byrne et al., 2004). Recent clinical research programs have focused on anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies or soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptors as a therapy (Howarth et al., 2005, Berry et al., 2006, Erin et al., 2006, Morjaria et al., 2008), highlighting the importance of inflammation as well as Th2 responses in asthma.",

The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response following a range of different stimuli including CS, pollution, and pulmonary viral or bacterial infection. The clinical characteristics of cough, shortness of breath and sputum production reflect the underlying pathological changes. Mucus hypersecretion and cillary dysfunction lead to collapse of damaged small airways producing airflow limitation, gas trapping and the characteristic obstructive picture on spirometry. While the aetiology of COPD is certainly associated with smoking, the phenotype observed in COPD is variable and complex, and is likely the result of both various genetic and environmental factors.",

            "text": "Recently much has been learnt regarding the mechanism by which CS and pulmonary infections contribute to COPD. Stable COPD is generally associated with increased airway CD8+ T lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophilia (Saetta et al., 1998, Saetta et al., 1999, Qiu et al., 2003, Baraldo et al., 2004), and in some patients, eosinophils (Rutgers et al., 2000). COPD and CS are also highly associated with reactive oxygen, as measured by 8-Isoprostane analysis (Montuschi et al., 2000), reactive oxygen is believed to be central to COPD, by inducing lung damage and hence the initiation of inflammation. During exacerbations, the cellular infiltrate may be more variable, and also demonstrate increased neutrophil chemokines such as ENA-78 and IL-8 (Qiu et al., 2003). COPD exacerbations are also related to an increase in systemic inflammatory molecules, including c-reactive protein and TNF-\u03b1 (Gan et al., 2004). Recently, a small pilot study has demonstrated that experimental RV challenge is feasible in COPD patients, and induced changes typically experienced during exacerbations of COPD (Mallia et al., 2006).",

The use of inhaled GCs in COPD remains controversial, with inhaled GC use recommended for moderate/severe COPD rather than mild COPD. Recently, a large clinical trial has shown improvements in lung function, and exacerbation frequency in individuals receiving combined inhaled GC and LABA treatment versus placebo (Calverley et al., 2007). Oral GC therapy is also recommended for the treatment of COPD exacerbations. An update on current treatment regimes for COPD is provided by the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis Management and Prevention of COPD (Rabe et al., 2007).",

NF-\u03baB or Rel family members are believed to play a central role in a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. For this reason the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway has been the focus of extensive research over the last 20 years. NF-\u03baB is activated in response to a number of stimuli, including physical and chemical stress, LPS, dsRNA, ssRNA, T and B cell mitogens and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Rothwarf and Karin, 1999, Karin and Lin, 2002, Li and Verma, 2002, Karin et al., 2004). NF-\u03baB induced gene expression is controlled by a complex series of enzymatic signalling events, at multiple levels. An overview of the NF-\u03baB activation cascade is depicted in Fig. 1\n.",

            "text": "Rel family members share an N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD) which mediates dimerisation, nuclear translocation, and the binding of specific \u03baB sites within promoters of affected genes. The consensus \u03baB site is the decameric sequence 5\u2032-GGGAATTTCC-3\u2032, however extensive variations exist. In mammals there are five known members of the Rel family: p50 (NF-\u03baB1, precursor of which is p105), p65 (Rel A, NF-\u03baB3), p52 (NF-\u03baB2, precursor of which is p100), c-Rel and Rel B. The p50 and p65 subunits are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the other three are generally restricted to specific differentiated cell types (reviewed in Siebenlist et al., 1994). In resting cells, the majority of NF-\u03baB is bound to I\u03baB inhibitory protein which masks the nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and holds the complex in the cytoplasm. There are a number of different I\u03baB proteins such as I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b3, I\u03baB\u025b and Bcl-3. It is generally believed that the different isoforms are associated with particular Rel protein dimers, bound via their RHD. For example I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b2 associate with p65:p50 and p50:c-Rel, whereas I\u03baB\u025b only binds to p65 and c-Rel hetero and homodimers. Upon appropriate stimulation, the I\u03baB protein is phosphorylated and ubiquinated, and subsequent 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. I\u03baB isoform phosphorylation is stimulus specific, for example I\u03baB\u03b2 is only phosphorylated by certain stimuli including LPS and IL-1\u03b2, whereas I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation is triggered by most NF-\u03baB activators. This level of control is also thought to impact on the cell type specificity and kinetics of the response, which in turn can influence the duration of transcription.",

            "text": "I\u03baB phosphorylation and activation of Rel proteins can occur via the classical (canonical) or alternative pathway. In the classical pathway, a critical phosphorylation of the I\u03baB protein is performed by the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of at least three subunits, two catalytic subunits IKK-\u03b1/IKK-1 and IKK-\u03b2/IKK-2 and a regulatory subunit IKK-\u03b3/NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) (Scheidereit, 1998, Karin, 1999, Courtois et al., 2001). Of the two catalytic subunits IKK-\u03b2 is 20 fold more active than IKK-\u03b1 in phosphorylation of I\u03baB (Mercurio et al., 1997). In the classical pathway, it has been shown that IKK-\u03b2, and not IKK-\u03b1, is important in NF-\u03baB activation, and the two kinases have distinct rather than overlapping functions (Hu et al., 1999, Li et al., 1999a, Li et al., 1999b, Takeda et al., 1999). The classical pathway includes signalling from TLR/IL-1R family members, intracellular pattern recognition receptors including retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated factor-5 (MDA-5), and protein kinase R (PKR). Ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR), and signalling from the TNFR are also examples of the classical pathway (reviewed in (Hacker & Karin, 2006) (Fig. 1).",

The phosphorylation status of NF-\u03baB can influence activation, for example phosphorylation of p65 may enhance transcriptional activation, however phosphorylation of p105 can reduce its processing into p50 (Naumann & Scheidereit, 1994). NF-\u03baB can also associate with other transcriptional proteins such as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) (reviewed in Ito et al., 2007). Similarly acetylation of the Rel proteins can increase the time it is located in the nucleus (Chen et al., 2002). Furthermore recent data would suggest that these two modification steps occur in a stepwise manner, phosphorylation of RelA is required prior to and enhances acetylation of Rel A, and improved transcriptional activity (Chen et al., 2005). Hence the NF-\u03baB pathway represents a well studied signal transduction pathway, relevant to many human diseases. The next part of this article will focus on how this knowledge has been applied to generating new therapies for asthma and COPD.",

While a wealth of small animal studies have demonstrated the role of NF-\u03baB in inflammation following respiratory viral or bacterial infections (Haeberle et al., 2002, Haeberle et al., 2004, Sadikot et al., 2006, Quinton et al., 2007), NF-\u03baB also appears to be important in the allergic response. In the ovalbumin (OVA) sensitisation and challenge model, total lung extracts from Brown-Norway rats exhibit enhanced NF-\u03baB activity (Lin et al., 2000). In a murine model, bronchial epithelium exhibits robust and rapid NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation and IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2 activity, compared to controls (Poynter et al., 2002). Mice that lack NF-\u03baB p50 have reduced eosinophilic responses to aerolised allergen. This effect was shown to be due to a lack of T cell production of Th2 cytokines, IL-13, IL-4 and the eosinophil growth factor IL-5 (Das et al., 2001), and also the chemokine eotaxin (Yang et al., 1998).",

This limitation has been overcome through the creation of tissue specific deficient mice, with targeted deletion of IKK-\u03b2 in Clara epithelial cells in the bronchial tissue (Broide et al., 2005). Upon OVA sensitisation and challenge, airway eosinophils, mucus, peribronchiolar fibrosis, eotaxin and the Th2 T cell chemokine TARC were reduced compared to littermate controls with functional IKK-\u03b2.

As IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb are induced by viruses in an NF-\u03baB dependent manner (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995, Wathelet et al., 1998, Chu et al., 1999, Osterlund et al., 2005), targeting NF-\u03baB in asthma and COPD may not only reduce harmful pro-inflammatory and allergen induced responses, but may also reduce beneficial anti-viral responses. This issue requires clarification in appropriate animal models before targeting NF-\u03baB in viral induced asthma exacerbations can be applied in human studies. A list of cytokines, chemokines and other molecules regulated in an NF-\u03baB dependent manner associated with asthma or COPD is provided in Table 1\n.",

In support, Wilson et al. have demonstrated a reduction in activated NF-\u03baB staining after treatment with budesonide or the LABA formoterol (Wilson et al., 2001). Bronchial biopsies from budesonide treated individuals also had significantly less IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF, however no difference was observed for formoterol treated samples. In contrast, Hart et al., studying NF-\u03baB\u2013DNA binding in stable asthmatic bronchial biopsies and alveolar macrophages after treatment with fluticasone propionate, showed no decrease in NF-\u03baB activity compared to a placebo administered control group. Fluticasone was effective however at reducing BAL eosinophils and improved lung function (Hart et al., 2000).

While clearly less effective than in stable disease, the lack of efficacy in exacerbations remains poorly understood. One theory is that as most exacerbations have viral and bacterial aetiologies, this may involve distinct mechanisms, involving different cells and or molecules than in stable forms of either disease. In vitro, in normal tissue, GC based therapies reduce inflammatory mediators induced by viral and non-viral stimuli (IL-1\u03b2) with about the same efficacy (Edwards et al., 2006a, Edwards et al., 2007), arguing against the above. This is also supported by the fact that much of the underlying inflammation in both stable, non-viral and viral or bacterial induced exacerbations involves NF-\u03baB. More research, particularly in asthmatic and COPD tissue, and the testing of known NF-\u03baB inhibitors in models of asthma or COPD exacerbation are required to carefully scrutinize these mechanisms.",

Initial experiments demonstrated that the target cell population within the lung consisted of DCs, T cells, macrophages and granulocytes, located with the bronchial and perivascular areas of the lung. Interestingly, structural cells, including bronchial epithelial cells were not transfected in this study. At 24 h post treatment, mice treated with NF-\u03baB decoy oligonucleotides exhibited lower BAL eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages compared to untreated, ovalbumin challenged mice or mice treated with a scrambled, non-specific oligonucleotide. Differences were also observed in BAL cytokines, with IL-13, IL-5, IFN-\u03b3, and eotaxin being lower in mice challenged with ovalbumin and treated with the NF-\u03baB decoy oligonucleotide. Treated animals also exhibited less AHR than control groups, strongly suggesting that inhibiting NF-\u03baB can directly affect lung function in this model. Finally PAS staining of lung sections revealed lower levels of mucin protein in OVA challenged NF-\u03baB decoy oligonucleotide treated animals compared to control animals. IL-4, and IgE levels were not affected, suggesting that not all components of the allergic cascade can be affected using this strategy.",

As yet, there has been no clinical trials using IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors in asthma or COPD, however several inhibitors have been used in phase I and II clinical trials in other disorders, notably cancer (reviewed in Karin et al., 2004). These compounds are widely used in research, particularly in small animal models.

It would appear that IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors may possess a more comprehensive anti-inflammatory profile to that of GCs, for instance IL-1\u03b2 induced G-CSF release from primary ASM is virtually steroid resistant, whereas it is completely blocked by two structurally different IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors (Birrell et al., 2005a). This is potentially very exciting, because the inflammation in COPD patients, and a sub-population of asthmatics are reportedly resistant to GC treatment. Peroxynitrite, and nitration of HDACs, caused by reactive oxygen produced by CS, have been implicated in causing steroid resistance in COPD (Barnes et al., 2004, Ito et al., 2005). Also, a sub population of asthmatics, are believed to have reduced GR levels, GR translocation and recruitment of HDAC, reducing GC efficacy (Adcock et al., 1995a, Adcock et al., 1995b, Matthews et al., 2004). Hence a distinct advantage of IKK-\u03b2 inhibition is to bypass these problems associated with GC based therapies. Furthermore, a recent publication has suggested that IKK-\u03b2 inhibition may have additional anti-inflammatory activity which is separate to the impact on NF-\u03baB signalling, as shown using the IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor TCPA-1, a structural different IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor, and dominant negative IKK-\u03b2 (Tudhope et al., 2007). The mechanism however is currently unknown. Also, a cell permeable peptide which specifically disrupts the IKK-\u03b2/NEMO interaction (May et al., 2000), has been used in vitro to block NF-\u03baB signalling in an IKK-\u03b2 dependent manner (Dai et al., 2004). Such small peptide inhibitors are also valuable tools, to highlight mechanisms in vitro and perhaps also as therapeutics in vivo.",

IKK-\u03b2 inhibition has been effective in LPS models of COPD (Ziegelbauer et al., 2005, Birrell et al., 2006). Similarly, IL-13 induced inflammation in the mouse is reduced with an IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor (Chapoval et al., 2007). One might question the clinical relevance of these animal models; for example unlike the inflammation in clinical COPD, the LPS induced inflammation is modulated by GC treatment. Another rodent model of COPD utilising elastase as a stimulus, which is known to be steroid resistant has also recently been shown to also be resistant to an IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor (Birrell et al., 2006). This result might be expected, as the inflammation observed in this model appears to occur without any obvious signs of NF-\u03baB pathway involvement (Birrell et al., 2005b). Again one may question the clinical relevance of this model, especially considering the apparent increase in the NF-\u03baB pathway activity in patients with COPD (Caramori et al., 2003). However, regardless of whether this model represents human COPD, it appears to demonstrate NF-\u03baB-independent, GC resistant inflammation which could be very interesting to explore. As yet there are no reports on the impact of an IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor in the more accepted CS driven animal model of COPD. These studies are crucial for the further validation of IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors in COPD.",

Protein degradation through the UPS involves ubiquitin conjugation to proteins destined for destruction and is mediated by the enzymes E1, E2 and E3. Polyubiquinated proteins are recognised by the proteasome which de-ubiquinates, unfolds and destroys the target protein (reviewed in Nalepa et al., 2006). The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex consisting of a proteolytic core particle, the 20S proteosome, capped on each end by two regulatory complexes. The 20S proteasome contains 3 pairs of active sites with distinct specificities termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and caspase-like (reviewed in Gilmore and Herscovitch, 2006). There are several classes of reversible and irreversible proteasome inhibitors all of which target the 20S proteasome, some of which have been utilised in asthma or COPD research. Several studies have reported modulation of eosinophil function by blocking NF-\u03baB signalling using proteasome inhibitors. Eosinophils secrete a variety of potentially damaging mediators in response to pro-inflammatory- and microbial stimuli in an NF-\u03baB dependent manner (Rankin et al., 2000). The activity of the lactocystin-derivative proteasome inhibitor PS-519 was examined in a rat model of OVA induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Intratracheal dosing of PS-519 before and after allergen exposure significantly reduced the number of eosinophils in sensitised lungs. Furthermore, a low dose of PS-519 was similarly effective at decreasing eosinophilic inflammation in the airways when used in combination with the GC budesonide, demonstrating the potential for combination treatment regimens with GCs (Elliott et al., 1999).",

Several studies have demonstrated that MG-132 mediated NF-\u03baB inhibition modulates eosinophil activity and reduces allergic inflammation. TNF-\u03b1 induced IL-8 by purified human eosinophils was blocked by pre-treatment with MG-132. Additionally, inhibition of NF-\u03baB signalling by MG-132 enabled TNF-\u03b1 to induce eosinophil apoptosis rather than induce IL-8 production (Fujihara et al., 2002). The expression of cell adhesion molecules such as the \u03b22 integrin CD18 are critical to eosinophil homing to sites of inflammation, and can be induced by TNF-\u03b1 or co-culture with bronchial epithelial cells (Teixeira et al., 1994). TNF-\u03b1 also initiates ICAM-1 expression on bronchial epithelial cells via NF-\u03baB activation (Chen et al., 2001). MG-132 treatment reduced expression of CD18 on eosinophils and ICAM-1 on BEAS-2B cells following co-culture, irrespective of the presence of TNF-\u03b1, highlighting a role for bronchial epithelial cells in NF-\u03baB mediated upregulation of cell adhesion molecules on eosinophils (Wong et al., 2006).",

TLR agonists are potent activators of the classical NF-\u03baB pathway. Inhibition of the proteasome by MG-132 has also revealed a role for NF-\u03baB and TLR3/4 stimulation in tracheal contraction. One study demonstrated that the expression of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 in the smooth muscle layer of mouse trachea increased contractile response to bradykinin following stimulation with TLR agonists LPS and polyIC. This response was associated with nuclear translocation of p65 and up-regulation of kinin B1 and B2 receptor mRNA and could be inhibited by MG-132 (Bachar et al., 2004).",

Stimulation of macrophages via TLR4 leads to NF-\u03baB activation and production of IL-8 (Brightbill et al., 1999). To assess the role of CS and induction of NF-\u03baB regulated pro-inflammatory gene expression, human monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with CS in vitro and increased IL-8 production was observed. This response was dependent on TLR4 activation and was associated with phosphorylation of IRAK and activation of NF-\u03baB. MG-132 mediated proteasomal inhibition prevented CS induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (Karimi et al., 2006). The peptide boronic acids, also known as dipeptidyl boronates, originally used as inhibitors of serine proteases, comprise another class of protease inhibitors blocking the chymotrypsin-like site in the 20S subunit core. While these have shown efficacy against several tumours, there is little data describing their use in treating airway inflammation (reviewed in Gilmore & Herscovitch, 2006). Large clinical trials using proteasome inhibitors also highlight potential side effects associated with proteasome inhibitor use. A clinical trial utilising Bortezomib, a boronic acid dipeptide, induced several side effects including thrombocytopenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia (Richardson et al., 2003). It is thought that the side effects could be the result of the expression of many genes and cellular processes influenced by proteasome inhibition, and this concept requires consideration before being applied to studies in asthma and COPD.",

Antisense technology uses stablilised phosphothionate oligonucleotides to bind to complementary mRNA, thus blocking translation. OVA sensitised mice injected intravenously twice with a p65 antisense oligonucleotide show a significant reduction in the level of p65 protein and NF-\u03baB activation in the lung.

Once delivered, siRNA transiently silences gene expression by directing sequence-specific degradation of a target mRNA by an endogeneous RNA-induced silencing complex (Elbashir et al., 2001). The majority of reports to date describing the use of siRNA to treat lung disease in vivo have targeted respiratory virus infections (Bitko et al., 2005), demonstrating the general usefulness of delivering siRNA to the airway in vivo. Also, studies using cultured airway epithelial cells have demonstrated the utility of siRNA targeting p65 in reducing TNF-\u03b1 induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Primary epithelial cells transfected with p65-targeting siRNA produced less IL-6 and IL-8 in response to TNF-\u03b1, however this depended on the cells being undifferentiated at the time of transfection (Platz et al., 2005). An alternative to using transfection to deliver siRNA to the lungs, is to use a viral delivery system. Another study has employed a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing a p65-targeting siRNA. Using a similar cellular model to the previous study, expression of siRNA against p65 suppressed secretion of IL-8 by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated BEAS-2B cells (Pinkenburg et al., 2004). While the application of this technology in vitro or in vivo is relatively recent, there is growing interest in this field, and as the methodology associated with both the design and delivery of siRNA expands, this approach is certain to broaden the range of therapeutic options available for asthma and COPD.",

A large body of evidence has convincingly demonstrated a clear role for NF-\u03baB transcription factors and their signalling kinases in both the stable and exacerbation forms of either disease. These data are the sum of several lines of evidence, and are apparent in investigations using diseased tissue, animal models of disease, and in vitro culture cell systems. While the role of the NF-\u03baB pathway is clear, and methodologies to inhibit NF-\u03baB are encouraging in animal models, which molecules to specifically target and appropriate methods of their inhibition in human studies are less so. There is good evidence for small molecule inhibition methodologies, and also for the use of oligonucleotide based methodologies, including decoy oligonucleotides and siRNA. Further, carefully controlled studies in reliable animal models must be performed to address this complex issue before any form of inhibition can be tested in human studies. Which NF-\u03baB signalling molecule represents the best therapeutic target is again a perplexing question. While knowledge of each NF-\u03baB signalling molecule is expanding, researchers need to respect many variables, including cell type specificity, and which aspect of pathogenesis to inhibit (allergic versus non allergic inflammation, secreted cytokine/chemokine or non-secreted enzyme, adhesion molecule). Another important point worth considering is which end points are most important, especially in animal models. While inhibiting NF-\u03baB clearly affects a range of different end points, including allergic and non-allergic inflammation, and AHR, there does exist some heterogeneity between different models. This is a truly salient point, differential targeting of the NF-\u03baB pathway in different cell types may alter various end points and disease outcome in these animal models. It is likely that each outcome may be model dependent; hence the results of different models need to be interpreted with caution. The above points need to be thoroughly considered in future studies if NF-\u03baB is going to be a serious contender for therapeutic intervention in human disease.",

GCs may act by binding activated NF-\u03baB family members and preventing their association with \u03baB sites (trans-repression) or by recruiting HDACs, and preventing chromatin disassociation, and hence assess to \u03baB sites within affected genes.",
