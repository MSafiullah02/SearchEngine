The information content of the folded complex constitutes a functional unit that plays a crucial role in biological processes. The origin of the word \u201cProtein\u201d is from the Greek \u201cprota\u201d which means \u201cof primary importance.\u201d This name was coined by J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius in 1838 for large organic compounds with a very close similarity in their empirical formulae and of primary importance in animal nutrition, though the evidences were not so prominent at that time. A landmark in protein chemistry came through Frederick Sanger and his colleagues, at the University of Cambridge in 1954 when, after 10 years of hard work, they succeeded in solving the complete primary structure of insulin (Sanger and Tuppy, 1951, Sanger, 1952, Sanger and Thompson, 1953). The very next milestone in protein chemistry was Max Perutz (Perutz and Weisz, 1947, Perutz, 1960, Perutz et al., 1960) and Sir John Cowdery Kendrew (Kendrew et al., 1958, Kendrew et al., 1960, Kendrew, 1959) solving the 3D structure of hemoglobin and myoglobin. These findings are the basis of modern age of advanced structural protein chemistry research.",

            "text": "Proteins form the building blocks of the structure and function of biological entities. A typical mammalian cell contains as many as 10,000 different proteins having a diverse array of functions (Karp, 2008). The set of proteins expressed in a cell or cell type is called a proteome. Proteins are generally a few hundred amino acids in chain length but can vary in size from a few tens of amino acids to over 34,000 amino acids, for example, the human titins, also known as the largest in protein world (MW = 3\u20133.7 MDa; Opitz et al., 2003). While a single protein chain can theoretically fold in an unlimited number of ways (Chou and Fasman, 1974b, Fasman, 1989, Feldman and Hogue, 2002), typically a specific amino acid chain folds to a particular structure through a process that is not yet clearly understood (Dill et al., 2007, Dill et al., 2008, Ghosh et al., 2007), but which is the basis for all protein interactions; recent research shows that the folded structure might have conformational changes depending on the environment too (Makowski et al., 2008). Protein structure is often referred to in terms of four aspects: The primary structure consisting of the amino acid chain, the secondary structure which contains regularly repeating structures like alpha helices and beta sheets stabilized by hydrogen bonds, the tertiary structure which is the final folded structure incorporating the various secondary structures, and a quaternary structure where several proteins are bound together to form one protein complex such as are found in the neuraminidase body of an influenza virion (Russell et al., 2006) or the VP7 of a rotavirus particle (Li et al., 2009b). The tertiary and quaternary structures of a large number of proteins have become available through X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy studies and the data are available in Protein Data Bases (PDB) such as World Wide Protein Data Bank (WWPDB; Berman et al., 2007), RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB-PDB; Deshpande et al., 2005, Dutta et al., 2007), Protein Data Bank Europe (PDBe; Velankar et al., 2010), Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj; Nakamura et al., 2002, Kinjo et al., 2010), and Biological Magnetic Resonance Databank (BMRB; Markley et al., 2008). The difficulty of crystallizing proteins has restricted the number of proteins whose structures are sufficiently well known (Chayen, 2004, Chayen, 2009, Chayen and Saridakis, 2008). However, taking the protein primary structure as the source material for all subsequent structures, structural genomics and protein structure prediction methods theoretically predict protein secondary and tertiary structures based on known structures (Baker and Sali, 2001).",

            "text": "The importance of proteins in biological function have led to wide ranging studies to understand how proteins fold (Dobson, 2004, Dill et al., 2007, Ghosh et al., 2007), interact with other proteins to regulate enzyme activity (Frieden, 1971), oligomerize to form fibrils (Powers and Powers, 2008), aggregate to protein complexes that lead to conformational changes, and enable signaling networks. These interactions are mediated by the chief characteristic of a protein: the ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly to it. The specificity arises from unique shapes in the tertiary structure of the protein surface (Roach et al., 2005, Roach et al., 2006) where, for example, a depression acts as a binding site or pocket and by the chemical natures of the side chains of the neighboring amino acids. This also results in total inability to bind in cases where changes in the amino acid composition render conformational changes to the binding site (Moscona, 2005). Such changes arising out of mutations in the amino acid chains are among the main factors responsible for development of drug resistance in bacterial and viral diseases (Moscona, 2004). Enzymatic role of proteins helps catalyze metabolic reactions but only a small region of the protein consisting of a few amino acids are active in the catalysis; a noncatalytic example of protein includes the antibodies that are part of the adaptive immune systems and act as a binder to antigens for destruction (MacCallum et al., 1996). Ligand-binding proteins such as hemoglobin bind specific small molecules to transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism (Baldwin and Chothia, 1979). Structural proteins such as actin and tubulin confer stiffness and rigidity to the cytoskeleton (Doherty and McMahon, 2008); other structural proteins such as myosin and kinesin generate mechanical forces and are responsible for the motility of many single cell organisms (Rayment, 1996).",

A virus particle like the influenza or rotavirus contains about 8\u201311 protein-coding genes in a multiprotein coat that protects the RNA or DNA of the virus and also enables the proteins and genetic materials to enter and leave cells. A great range of variability in amino acid composition is observed for these viral proteins (Reid et al., 2000, Ghosh et al., 2009), specifically the surface situated ones like NA (neuraminidase; Ghosh et al., 2010), HA (hemagglutinin), VP4 (variable protein), VP7 (Gunn et al., 1985), and gp120 (of the HIV) but the functional impact remains the same. Often, a single change in the side chain of a single amino acid is enough for producing a new mutant (Lopez et al., 2005). Viruses use this highly mutable property for escaping the host defense mechanism and they are also frequently found to generate escape mutants against a naturally occurring immunity or artificially designed drug or vaccine (Air and Laver, 1989).",

Bacterial, viral, and other pathogens disrupt the normal protein functions and thereby destabilize the infected host organism (Goldsby et al., 2000). While immunological defenses are called into action by the infection, often these are inadequate by themselves and have to be supported by drugs, vaccines, and other therapeutical regimes. Design of drugs and study of their actions have therefore been an important area of research. Drugs can act through formation of drug\u2013DNA complexes (Chaires, 1997, Chaires, 1998) or protein\u2013drug complexes (Chicault et al., 1981). Major trends of research into drug\u2013DNA relationships have been recently reviewed (Nandy and Basak, 2010). Stated simply, DNA drugs and vaccines are made of plasmids designed to carry a selected gene into cells where it is translated into a protein. In the case of antiviral DNA vaccine, for example, plasmids are created for producing the selected viral protein in the cell and immune systems are expected to act to prevent future infections from the virus (Ulmer, Deck, et al., 1996, Ulmer, Sadoff and Liu, 1996, Gurunathan et al., 2000). Advanced techniques such as codon optimization (Deml et al., 2001) are enhancing the protein production from the plasmids and others such as adjuvant incorporation are enhancing the immune response leading to more effective vaccines and therapies, several of which are already available for treatment of specified animals afflicted with the West Nile virus (Kramer et al., 2007), melanoma and fetal loss, while applications for humans for treating HIV, influenza, hepatitis C, and other diseases are under trial (Morrow and Weiner, 2010).",

Conventional production processes for antibiotics are expensive and face many regulatory issues. Vaccines that enhance the body's immune system consist of attenuated viruses but can, in rare cases, harm the host with a full-blown viral occupancy (Ball et al., 1998, Colgrove and Bayer, 2005). Since viruses use the host's cells to replicate, designing safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult and also makes it difficult to find targets for the drugs that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism's cells. But almost all antimicrobials, including antivirals, are subject to drug resistance as the pathogens mutate over time (Gold and Moellering, 1996), becoming less susceptible to the treatment. Small molecules are often used as drugs, but the new technology of recombinant proteins (Geigert, 1989, Dingermann, 2008), commonly produced using bacteria or yeast in a bioreactor, potentially provide greater efficacy and fewer side effects because their action can be more precisely targeted toward the cause of a disease rather than treatment of symptoms, is yet to gain wide acceptance.",

However, peptide drug screening process (Otvos, 2008), although a well-established approach, is long and arduous resulting in high manufacturing costs, and the fact that they have short half-life, and limited in vivo bioavailability hampers their effectiveness; new approaches have been proposed to overcome the difficulty of generating sufficient amount of the required tRNAs (Owens, 2004).

These issues of stability of therapeutic proteins toward aggregation and misfolding in long-term storage as well as means of efficacious delivery that avoid adverse immunogenic side effects are engaging the attention of the pharmaceutical industry (Frokjaer and Otzen, 2005). While invasive routes such as subcutaneous injections are often used, oral delivery faces difficulties in poor permeability across biological membranes due to the hydrophobic nature and large molecular size, susceptibility to enzymatic attack, among others. Formulation strategies for protein therapeutics thus continue to remain a challenging problem.",

The protein engineering market is expected to cross $100 billion in sales in 2010 from about $36 billion 4 years ago. The top-selling therapeutic protein is reported to be Amgen's Aranesp (Locatelli and Vecchio, 2001), a reengineered variant of the company's first-generation product Epogen (recombinant human erythropoietin). A number of such products have been launched by Genetech and others, and nonparenteral delivery systems, alongside parenteral protein and peptide drug delivery systems have also been approved (Packhaeuser et al., 2004). Progress in bioinformatics and computational biology as well as new techniques in protein engineering (recombinant proteins through site-directed mutagenesis and posttranslational modifications) are aiding the development of reengineered, improved, whole antibody, and antibody fragment-based products, reducing immunogenicity by using fully human recombinant antibodies or human antibodies derived from transgenic mice and allowing biosimilar products to be differentiated on the basis of superior characteristics. Screening experiments for appropriate molecules rely critically on bioinformatics support for design of experiments and for interpreting the generated data, for example, to identify interesting differentially expressed genes and to predict the function and structure of putative target proteins (Lengauer and Zimmer, 2000).",

            "text": "Protein characterization and in silico protein design and structure analyses form an integral part of these developments. Phylogenetic analyses based on primary sequences have been used to group related proteins and understand their evolutionary history, algorithms have been developed to predict protein secondary structures, and web accessible systems are available to suggest possible folding patterns (Shen and Chou, 2009). A number of epitope prediction tools have been devised with varying degrees of success to aid in drug design (Yang and Yu, 2009); one area of nascent research is concerned with understanding of allosteric conformations that may help or hinder protein interactions (Teague, 2003). In a broader area, computational biology has already proved itself as one of the powerful tools for handling the large genomic databases. The basic applications involve killer tools like sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree drawing, sequence comparison, etc. In silico motif search algorithms on primary protein structure can be applied for finding structural information like signal sequence prediction (Menne et al., 2000), cleavage site prediction (Chou, 2001), glycosylation prediction (Blom et al., 2004), posttranslational modifications prediction, etc. Large datasets are frequently found to be utilized in predictions of protein structural levels from primary structure. Software like Modeller (Eswar et al., 2007, Eswar et al., 2008), Discovery Studio, etc., can predict 3D structure of proteins from a database of known crystallized proteins. Many theories have been developed in this prediction research but they are often ineffective in case of a completely new protein for comparison with the preexisting database (comparative protein modeling) or a protein without appropriate template. Another very important application of data mining is the use of computational power in handling the proteomics data. In proteomics, proteins are detected by matching a part of it with the whole existing protein database in mass spectrophotometer software (Perkins et al., 1999). The basis of all these data mining and related computational techniques is mathematics and statistics. Different theories like dot-matrix algorithm (Gibbs and McIntyre, 1970), Needleman Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), Smith Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981, Smith et al., 1985), Hidden Marakov model (Eddy, 1996), Chou-Fasman algorithm (Chou and Fasman, 1974a, Chou and Fasman, 1974b), etc., are widely used. Some models or algorithms work on interpretation from statistics and probability and others depend on the visual interpretation of genomic data by different techniques (Nandy, 1994, Randic, 2004, Randic, 2006, Randic et al., 2005, Randic et al., 2006, Nandy et al., 2007, Basak and Gute, 2008, Gonzalez-Diaz, Gonzalez-Diaz, et al., 2008, Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2009).",

However, while some standard procedures such as dot-matrix plot have been used for a long time, several ingenious schemes have been developed recently that have marked significant success in this nascent field as we show in the next few sections. Coronavirus phylogeny, studies of H5N1 neuraminidase protein mutations and identification of highly conserved peptide stretches on influenza virus and rotavirus proteins that could potentially aid in the development of new drugs and vaccines are some of the significant results of application of these novel techniques.

            "text": "The basic approach can be most simply described in the 2D representation where the four cardinal directions are associated with the four bases. Nandy (1994) associated adenine with the negative x-axis, cytosine with the + \ny-axis, guanine with + \nx-axis, and the thymine with the \u2013y-axis and plotted a sequence starting from the origin and moving, for each base in the sequence, one step at a time in the designated direction depending on the specific base until the entire sequence is plotted. Figure 3\nfollows the above mentioned direction of graphical representation technique for first 10 nucleotides of neuraminidase RNA (c-DNA) and generates a series of points like a Markov chain that reflects the sequence and distribution of bases in the sequence in the chosen representation. However, this simple approach has the disadvantage of allowing reentry in the random walk path, for example, a sequence like AGAGAG traces only one unit path in the Nandy representation, and several other schemes have been formulated that minimize or eliminate this problem, but with reduced visual appeal (Nandy et al., 2006). Randic and his coworkers, for example, proposed various representations such as \u201cworm\u201d curve (Randic et al., 2003c, Randic, 2004), \u201cfour horizontal line\u201d curve (Randic et al., 2003a, Randic et al., 2003b), four-color maps (Randic et al., 2005), \u201cspectrum-like\u201d figures (Randic, 2006) among others to reduce or eliminate the degeneracy inherent in the 2D approach. Yau et al. (2003) proposed a 2D graphical representation, where the purines (A, G) and pyrimidines (T, C) are plotted on two quadrants of the Cartesian coordinate system at fixed angles to the x-axis; such a system has no degenracy. A sequence is plotted as a progression of points counted along the x-axis but rising or falling with the nature of the base thus tracing a pattern that is unique for the particular sequence. Among other proposals, mention may be made of the recent works of Todeschini et al., 2006, Todeschini et al., 2008 who use partial ordering ideas to compare the first exons of eight beta-globin sequences, and Liu and Wang (2010) who used an 8D representation of DNA sequences for comparison of similarities/dissimilarities of over 40 viral, lipase, phage, and other genes, both of which methods dispense with visual rendering in favor of more rigorous mathematical approaches.",

The g\nR here represents a base distribution index that is critically dependent upon the position of each base in the sequence and together with the \u03bc\nx, \u03bc\ny form a set of biodescriptors for the sequence. The g\nR and the \u0394g\nR have been found to be very sensitive measures of the sequence composition and distribution (Nandy and Nandy, 2003). The difference index, \u0394g\nR, provides a quantitative comparison between the sequences: the smaller the \u0394g\nR, the more similar are the underlying DNA sequences and the higher the \u0394g\nR, the more dissimilar are the sequences.",

(2000) in a 3D graphical representation in which the position of every base of a sequence was related to all other bases through a Euclidean and graph\u2013theoretic distance. The ratios of these distances, D\nE/D\nG, formed the elements of a DD matrix. Since matrices are well-known objects with well-defined properties, the leading eigenvalues of a DD matrix are considered to be characteristic, or invariants, of the matrix and, by association, to be descriptors of the DNA sequence itself. The authors calculated the leading eigenvalues of the first exon sequence of the beta-globin gene of eight species and determined the similarity/dissimilarity between the various sequences. This was followed by successive proposals for different graphical representations that similarly used matrix methods to determine invariants to characterize each sequence and form vectors of such invariants to estimate the degrees of similarities and dissimilarities between members of a family of DNA sequences (Nandy et al., 2006). The works of Randic, Todischini, and Wang referred to earlier use these techniques of DD matrices or Hasse matrices to compute the distances between species from their gene sequences.",

            "text": "The new GRANCH techniques gave a rich view of the complexities of DNA sequences. Among the first applications of these techniques to human diseases, Liao et al. (2006) showed that mathematical techniques can be used to analyze the underlying DNA/RNA sequences by studying the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and, separately, that GRANCH techniques could do away with multiple alignment requirements to study gene families. Larionov et al. (2008) broadened the usage by showing that plots of human and mouse chromosomal sequences in a graphical representation were able to reveal long-range palindromes. The 3D and 2D graphical representations visually highlighted the base preferences along a DNA sequence (Hamori and Ruskin, 1983, Nandy, 1994), while 2D representations showed long runs of duplications of a motif as simple runs on the graphs (Nandy and Nandy, 1995). Gates had remarked on large-scale complex repeats that were revealed by 2D graphs (Gates, 1986); Nandy showed that conserved genes have shapes on the 2D maps that are similar across species (Nandy, 1994), a visual rendition no doubt of homology. Viewing a number of maps of the H5N1 neuraminidase gene revealed a conserved region (Nandy et al., 2007), and numerical characterization of the maps, in the whole RNA sequence and in segments, has allowed reconstruction of the wide dissemination and possible recombination of segments of the gene not reported heretofore (Ghosh et al., 2009). In a novel application, using a variation of the 2D graphical representation, Wiesner and Wiesnerova (2010) studied multiallelic marker loci from Begonia\n \n\u00d7\n \ntuberhybrida. They found significant correlation of graph invariants to genetic diversity of the marker loci and suggested that DNA walk representation may predict allele-rich loci solely from their primary sequences, which improves current design of new DNA germplasm identificators. Recently, Nandy has shown from inspection of conserved gene representations on 2D maps (Nandy, 2009) that effects of point mutations in gene sequences over evolutionary time scales indicate a polynomial relationship between the intrapurine intrapyrimidine differences on each strand of a DNA sequence.",

            "text": "The experience with GRANCH techniques for DNA and RNA sequences led to many proposals for GRANCH methods for protein sequences, although complicated by the necessity of accommodating 20 residues for proteins compared with four bases for the nucleotide sequences. One of the earliest attempts is the dot-matrix plot for protein sequences, but other techniques were also developed. Among the pioneer works for representing the chemical information in a protein graphically is the representation of protein bonds through the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963, Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968) and, for protein primary sequences, the Hydropathy plot (Engelman et al., 1986). The former can extract the secondary structural information from protein's bond angles, while the latter draws the graph from thermodynamical and chemical properties of amino acids. The DNA graphical representation methodology led Randic to propose a Magic Circle representation (Randic et al., 2006), where the total protein sequence is represented in a unit circle and the graph starts from the center following the sequence by moving half way toward the corresponding amino acids which are positioned equally spaced on the circumference. The result of the complete execution of the protein sequence within the circle produces a typical graph for a particular protein (Fig. 4\n), except for large protein sequences which are often found to have lesser visual benefits. Li et al. used a reduction model of abstracting the protein sequence in a five-letter code (Wang and Wang, 1999, Li et al., 2008) each representing a specific group of amino acids and generated a 2D-graph by plotting the reduced sequence on the x-axis and all five group representatives horizontally at equal intervals along the y-axis resulting in a zig-zag like graphical representation of the sequence (Fig. 5\n). 2D graphical representations based on nucleotide triplet codons (Bai and Wang, 2006) have been proposed for sequence comparison and start\u2013stop sign of a coding region. Liao et al. (2006) used this approach to study 24 coronavirus genomic sequences which have ~ 29,000 bases each. They classified the 20 amino acids of a protein sequence into four separate groups according to the chemistry of their R groups: amino acids A, V, F, P, M, I, L belong to the hydrophobic chemical group; amino acids D, E, K, R belong to charged chemical group; amino acids S, T, Y, H, C, N, Q, W belong to polar chemical group; the unique G amino acid belongs to glycine chemical group. Starting with the nucleotide sequence, this enabled them to construct three 2D graphs (one for each reading frame) for each gene sequence and compute a distance matrix between the 24 coronaviruses from which they could generate a phylogenetic tree relating all the sequences without the need for any multiple alignments. Gonzalez-Diaz and his coworkers have used 2D lattice graphs for proteins (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006, Gonzalez-Diaz, Gonzalez-Diaz, et al., 2008), constructed in a similar way to the DNA representations of Nandy and adapted to proteins according to a proposed protocol (Estrada, 2002), and extended to other graph representations such as spiral and star networks (Aguero-Chapin, Antunes, et al., 2008, Aguero-Chapin, Gonzalez-Diaz, et al., 2008, Dea-Ayuela et al., 2008, Vilar et al., 2008, Munteanu et al., 2009); for example, for a star network, starting from the beginning of the sequence, the amino acids are placed in the corresponding branches transforming the protein sequence into modified branch connectivity graph from which connectivity indices (CIs) can be derived. Other authors have proposed higher dimensional representations such as the 3D model of Bai and Wang (2006) who embedded a dodecahedron in 3D space where each corner represented one of the 20 amino acids and thus generated a walk for the protein sequence, and the 20D representation of Novic and Randic (2008). The present authors have proposed an alternate 20D representation in Euclidean space (Nandy et al., 2009), where each amino acid is assigned to one axis in the 20D space and the sequence plotted using algorithms similar to the random walk model for 2D graphical representation of DNA sequences. This procedure generates a graph in the abstract 20D space from which consequences can be calculated to characterize proteins and quantify similarities and dissimilarities.",

            "text": "Analogously to the GRANCH techniques of DNA sequences, to obtain quantitative measures for protein sequences, Randic, Li, Humberto Gonzales-Diaz, and several other authors have extended the methodologies of numerical descriptors for DNA sequences and of topological indices (TIs) used in QSAR studies to analysis of protein sequences, viral surfaces, and RNA secondary structures (Estrada and Uriarte, 2001, Randic et al., 2004, Randic et al., 2008, Bai et al., 2005, Gonzalez-Diaz, Vilar, et al., 2007, Li, Baker, et al., 2009) leading to more general biological applications. Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz and collaborators have done extensive work on extension of these representations to the study of protein sequences (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2009) and applied to mass spectral data of proteins and protein serum profiles in parasites (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2008b), toxicoproteomics, and diagnosis of cancer patients (Cruz-Monteagudo et al., 2008, Gonzalez-Diaz, Gonzalez-Diaz, et al., 2008). Their group has used mathematical biodescriptors derived from toxicoproteomics maps in conjunction with chemodescriptors of toxic molecules to predict their toxicity (Hawkins et al., 2006). Integrated QSARs (Basak et al., 2006) developed using chemodescriptors for ligands and biodescriptors of a molecular entity, for example, connect structural information of drug molecules, DNA and RNA sequences, or RNA secondary and protein tertiary structures and may be used to predict parameters for new entities (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2008a). It has been found that using different type of numerical indices derived from the protein 2D molecular graphics to perform QSAR studies is simpler than having to work with the protein 3D structures (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2009, Vilar and Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, 2010). These indices describe graph/network topology, connectivity, or branching, often referred to as the graph TIs or network CIs used to determine structure\u2013function relationships in cellular biochemistry (Chou and Cai, 2003), and have been applied in theoretical biology and bioinformatics of small-size molecules, macromolecules, proteome mass spectra, and protein interaction networks (Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006, Gonzalez-Diaz, Saiz-Urra, et al., 2007, Gonzalez-Diaz, Gonzalez-Diaz, et al., 2008). Basak et al. (2011) have in a pathbreaking work using a new differential QSAR approach for study of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) from multiple strains of Plasmodium falciparum shown that DHFR from the wild strain is substantially different from four mutant strains of their study and remark that the protocols indicated in the paper can be used for the development of drugs to combat drug-resistant pathogens arising continuously in nature due to mutations. Bai and Wang (2005) proposed to numerically characterize protein sequences through the nucleotide triplet codons by using a 2D graphical representation system similar to that of Yau et al. (2003) to generate protein descriptors for the Homo sapiens X-linked nuclear protein (ATRX). An intuitively simpler indexation scheme based on the 20D graphical representation of protein sequences proposed by the present authors (Nandy et al., 2009) and described below has been found useful in generating phylogenetic relationships between sequences without necessity of multiple alignments and for determining conserved surface exposed stretches on viral proteins that could be useful in drug and vaccine designs (Ghosh et al., 2010).",

The application of a similar procedure to a set of nine nerve genes from various organisms led to the generation of phylogenetic trees (Fig. 7\n). While usual methods of generating such trees are difficult due to the varying lengths of the sequences, the matrix method with leading eigenvalues do not have such problems and generates fairly acceptable relationships, although some of the details show, as the authors point out, that the method requires further refinement. The method is also useful in that it allows visible inspection of protein sequence characteristics and thus is good for comparative study of proteins too.",

Representing each group by one amino acid, a protein sequence can be reduced to a sequence of five letters only, which can then be used to generate a random walk in a 3D Euclidean space where the steps are in designated cardinal directions (Fig. 8\n). Taking a cue from the work by Gonzalez-Diaz et al. (2005), they use the charge information of the amino acids and the number of amino acids at each node of the walk to define four charge coupling numbers for each sequence from which, after some combinatorics, they generate a 60-component vector for each sequence. Applying this technique to beta-globin protein sequences from 15 species, they were able to quantitatively assess the similarities and dissimilarities between the proteins from comparison of the sequence vectors. This also led to generation of a distance matrix which, though not explicitly shown by the authors, can be used to draw the phylogenetic tree for this protein family. The results obtained by the authors\u2019 prescription are analogous to established data.",

At the genome level, a very specific example of viral uniqueness resides in the existence of virus hallmark genes (Koonin et al., 2006), which play a central role in viral replication and structure, and are shared by a broad variety of viruses. In contrast to thermostable proteins like the heat-shock protein Thermotoga maritime (Tokuriki et al., 2009) which have specialized characteristics like high contact density, highly stable sequence composition, and highly compact structural scaffold, viral proteins necessarily have to be more complex to retain their functional characteristics in spite of the high variability.

The existence of the virus gene pool in China and continuous mutations among the virus strains have led to continued rapid spread worldwide by different carriers with sudden conflagrations erupting at different locations, among aquatic birds, poultry, and farm animals, and also infecting humans resulting in over 300 deaths out of 505 confirmed cases (from World Health Organization; updated August 31, 2010). The H5N1 virus, like all other influenza viruses, is an enveloped virus with an eight-segment single-stranded RNA in the core and two surface proteins on the envelope, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase, which are responsible for the glycosilation necessary for cell entry and exit. Although the number of fatalities in humans from this virus appears small, the rapid mutations that can occur in the RNA genome, and the possibility of whole gene or gene fragments shuffling between avian and mammalian hosts (Wu et al., 2008), are considered to carry the potential to cause a pandemic challenge. Since the inhibitors of this influenza virus, principally oseltamivir and zanamivir, act on the neuraminidase component of the H5N1 protein, continuous monitoring of the mutational changes in this gene assumes significance.",

Coronaviruses also are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded multisegment RNA genome, but ranging in size from 16 to 31 kb (Lai, 1990). The virus primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds, but the human SARS coronavirus also affects the lower respiratory tract. Experimental studies are complicated by the fact that the human coronaviruses are difficult to grow in the laboratory. While earlier only two coronaviruses were known, the HcoV-229E and HcoV-OC43 (Gorbalenya et al., 2004), after the SARS epidemic three more coronaviruses were identified by 2005, the SARS-CoV, the NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004), and HKU1 leading to interest in the evolutionary history of this virus.",

For each graph, they defined a geometric center of mass x\n0, y\n0 and a covariance matrix CM as(3)x0=\u2211xiN,y0=\u2211yiN\n(4)CMxx=\u2211(xi\u2212x0)(xi\u2212x0)N\n(5)CMxy=CMyx=\u2211(xi\u2212x0)(yi\u2212y0)N\n(6)CMyy=\u2211(yi\u2212y0)(yi\u2212y0)Nwhere the summations are over the subscript i which runs from 1 to N, the length of the sequence. The covariance matrix CM is a 2 \u00d7 2 square matrix with a leading eigenvalue \u03bb. Thus, for the three graphs of each sequence there will be a set of three geometric centers of masses and three leading eigenvalues.

The authors hypothesized that this may arise out of viral shedding in aquatic and nonaquatic habitats that are subsequently spread across wide regions by the migratory or local birds who themselves might not be infected but act merely as carrier agents. The p\nR analysis from this technique also showed for the first time that recombinations between segments in the neuraminidase gene may have been taking place.

This variability profile is then compared with a solvent accessibility profile to determine regions of low variability and high solvent accessibility implying that these identified regions would be accessible to drugs and vaccines and also offer target sites over many cycles of mutations. A view of the 3D structure also ensures that high surface exposed regions are actually selected. The authors determined six such regions on the neuraminidase protein (Fig. 10\n), of which the most promising appears to be the 50-base (16 amino acid) stretch at the 5\u2032-end of the gene mentioned earlier. A special feature of this 16 amino acid long peptide is its location on the dimeric interface (indicated by blue color in Fig. 10) of the quaternary structure of the neuraminidase protein, implying that any disruption of this stretch could interfere with the stability of the protein itself.",
