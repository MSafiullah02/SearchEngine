            "text": "Clinical microbiologists are constantly striving to deliver accurate test results more quickly to ensure that appropriate treatment and infection control measures are implemented on time. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as microscopy and culture are laborious, time-consuming and require considerable technical skill for accurate analysis of the pathogen [1,2]. The technology revolution that has occurred over the last few decades has considerably improved and expanded the diagnostic capabilities of modern clinical microbiology laboratories. In particular, the development of nucleic acid amplification chemistries that allows rapid amplification and characterization of the target nucleic acid has aided in the development of numerous commercial assays for several relevant viral pathogens (Table 1\n). The amplification chemistries are often modified to detect multiple targets or to improve the overall sensitivity and specificity of the method, by controlling specific reaction conditions or by the addition of specially designed oligonucleotides and enzymes. Most of these diagnostic methods have been automated or converted to a sample-to-answer format that can manipulate smaller volumes of sample and can deliver accurate, quantifiable test results in a short amount of time. Furthermore, automation eliminates the need for extensive training of laboratory personnel and reduces the possibility of contamination and human error. This review focuses on the major amplification chemistries, including target amplification, signal amplification, and probe amplification that are currently being used for developing commercial assays for the detection of viral pathogens, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and their application in the clinical virology laboratory.",

            "text": "The development of PCR by Kary Mullis in the 1980s revolutionized the detection of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens. PCR is a highly sensitive method that involves cyclical heating and cooling of the reaction mixture to facilitate amplification of the target DNA [3]. The method consists of three basic steps (denaturation, annealing, and extension) and the reaction mixture requires four primary components (template DNA, primers, nucleotides, and a DNA polymerase) (Fig. 1\na). Double-stranded target DNA (dsDNA) is thermally denatured to form a single-stranded DNA template (ssDNA). Oligonucleotide primers anneal to complementary target sequences on the nucleic acid template and are extended by the DNA polymerase, thus creating the resultant PCR product (amplicon). The reaction occurs in a programmable thermal cycler, and the steps are repeated for several cycles (n) to produce multiple copies (2n) of the target sequences [4]. The end product formed can be detected by various methods such as agarose gel electrophoresis, colorimetric detection, and chemiluminescence. Gel electrophoresis uses fluorescent dyes such as ethidium bromide, SYBR Green, SYBR Gold or SYBR Safe, that can intercalate between the stacked DNA bases and fluoresce under UV exposure [5]. In colorimetric detection, labeled oligonucleotides are incorporated within the target DNA, and the complex formed is detected using a chromogenic substrate [6]. In chemiluminescence detection, enzyme catalyzed chemical reactions involving the amplified nucleic acid emit energy in the form of light, which can be visualized by autoradiography or CCD imaging [7].",

            "text": "Alternatively, in real-time PCR (also known as quantitative PCR or qPCR), amplification and detection occur simultaneously, which can eliminate PCR post-processing steps and may reduce the overall turnaround time, depending on the assay design. The accumulated amplification product is measured in real time as the reaction progresses and thus quantified after each cycle, although real-time PCR can be used for both qualitative and quantitative DNA analysis. This method employs dsDNA intercalating dyes (SYBR Green I and EvaGreen) or fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides (Scorpions, Amplifluor, TaqMan, etc.) for detection and quantification of the amplified products [8]. The fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides can be further subdivided into three categories based on the type of fluorescent molecule used \u2013 primer probes (Scorpions, Amplifluor, etc.), hydrolysis probes (TaqMan, etc.), and hybridization probes (FRET, Molecular Beacons, etc.). While the dsDNA intercalating dyes increase fluorescence after binding to the minor groove of the DNA, the fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides either hybridize to the PCR product, or undergo hydrolysis, which then separates the fluorophore from a quenching dye and results in an increased signal (Fig. 1b). Quenching chemistries such as MultiCode\u00ae-RTx uses the synthetic DNA basepair 2\u02b9-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC):2\u02b9-deoxyisoguanosine (iG) (isobases) for site-specific incorporation of a quencher molecule that quenches fluorescence as a measure of amplification in real-time [9]. Commercial real-time PCR assays have been developed for the detection and quantification of most relevant viruses \u2013 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [10], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [11], hepatitis B virus (HBV) [12], herpes simplex virus 1&2 (HSV 1&2) [13], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [14].",

            "text": "Conventional PCR has been modified over time to increase sensitivity and specificity (nested-PCR), detect RNA targets (reverse-transcription or RT-PCR), and amplify multiple targets in the same reaction mixture (multiplex PCR). Nested PCR uses two sets of amplification primers and two successive PCR reactions [15]. In the first stage PCR, the first set of primers binds to the DNA template on either side of the target sequence so that there is some sequence flanking both ends of the target (Fig. 1c). The amplified product generated is used as a template for the second stage reaction where a second set of primers anneals to sequences internal to the first set. The sensitivity and specificity are increased by this method as the first amplicon provides more template for the second reaction and the second primer set can only anneal if the first amplicon has complementary sequences. The amplified product can be detected in the same way as conventional PCR [16]. Some disadvantages of nested PCR can be long turnaround time due to time-consuming post-PCR steps, difficulty to automate the procedure if the reactions are not performed in a single tube and require tube transfer, and increased risk of amplicon contamination because of high amplicon yield, particularly when the process employs separate tubes for each stage [17,18]. Commercial nested PCR and multiplex nested PCR assays have largely overcome these limitations and have been developed for the molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses such as Flu A & B, coronavirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [19], viruses causing meningitis and encephalitis such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, HSV 1 & 2, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), human parechovirus, and varicella -zoster virus (VZV) [20], and gastrointestinal viruses such as adenovirus F 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus GI/GII, rotavirus A, and sapovirus [21]. These assays have demonstrated 94\u2013100% sensitivity and >94% specificity for the viral targets in the various clinical trial studies.",

Three enzymes are used in this reaction \u2013 avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and T7 RNA polymerase that ultimately produce ssRNA as the terminal amplification product [36]. A sequence-specific primer (P1) binds the target sequence to be amplified and reverse transcriptase extends to produce a RNA\u2013DNA hybrid. RNase H degrades the RNA portion of the hybrid and the second primer (P2) binds to the remaining cDNA (Fig. 2\n). A second primer extension generates the complementary strand, forming a dsDNA molecule. The P1 primer includes a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site so that multiple RNA copies can be transcribed from the DNA template. The ssRNA end product can be detected by various methods such as gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked gel assay, enzymatic bead based detection, and electrochemiluminescence [37]. The primary concern for NASBA is RNA integrity and controlling the reaction temperature, as the enzymes involved are thermolabile. Commercial NASBA assays are clinically used for the detection of RSV [38], HIV-1 [39], CMV [40] and human papillomavirus (HPV) [41]. A multiplex NASBA assay for HIV-1 and HCV has been developed and demonstrated an analytical sensitivity of 1000 copies/mL, 93.3% clinical sensitivity, and 100% specificity [42].",

Since RNA is more labile than DNA, the possibility of carry-over contamination is reduced in TMA assays. The rapid kinetics of TMA can produce 100\u20131000 copies of target RNA per reaction cycle that ultimately results in greater than 109-fold amplification in a short period of time. The amplicons generated by TMA can be detected by gel electrophoresis or by oligonucleotide probes; however, detection using specific methods, such as hybridization protection assay (HPA) with radioactive or non-radioactive probes, allows amplification and detection in a single tube thereby minimizing the risk of amplicon contamination [44]. In HPA, acridinium ester (AE) labeled sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes are hybridized with the TMA end product, and the chemiluminescent signal from the probe-amplicon hybrids is measured [45]. The performance of TMA is critically dependent on primer design, and like NASBA, precise control of the reaction temperature is important for denaturing the secondary structures. Commercial TMA assays are available for the detection and quantification of HIV-1, HCV, and HBV and have demonstrated equivalent performance when compared to commercial real-time PCR assays [46].",

In the first stage of the reaction, the target DNA sequence is duplicated using four primers in the presence of DNA polymerase and results in the addition of restriction endonuclease sites at each end of the amplified target (Fig. 3\n). In the second stage, multiple cycles involving nicking of the restriction endonuclease site, extending the nicks by DNA polymerase, and strand displacement occur, resulting in exponential amplification of the target. The amplified target can be detected by photometry, sequence-specific labeled probes, and chemiluminescence [48,49]. The limitations of SDA include its inefficiency in amplifying long target sequences and the probability of producing considerable background reactions due to unspecific primer binding [50,51]. A commercial SDA assay developed for the detection of HSV 1 & 2 has demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.7\u2013100% and 98.4\u2013100%, and specificity of 95.1\u201399.4% and 80.6\u201397% for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively [52].",

            "text": "LAMP is an isothermal amplification that uses 4\u20136 sets of different primers which can individually recognize up to 6\u20138 distinct sequences on the target DNA [53]. The four core primers employed by the LAMP system are FIP (forward inner primer), BIP (backward inner primer), F3 (forward primer) and B3 (backward primer). The LAMP reaction starts when FIP binds to the F2c region of the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis [54] (Fig. 4\n). Following strand synthesis, the F3 primer hybridizes to the target DNA and is extended by DNA polymerase. Primer extension displaces the FIP-linked complementary strand which then forms a self-hybridizing loop structure at the 5\u2019 end. This strand serves as a template for the BIP, which initiates complementary strand synthesis and opens up the 5\u2019 end loop. After the complementary strand is synthesized, hybridization, extension, and displacement reactions are repeated with the B3 primer which generates a double looped dumbbell-shaped DNA. Nucleotides are added to the 3\u2019 open end and the dumbbell-shaped DNA is converted to a stem-loop structure. This stem-loop DNA structure serves as the initiator for the second stage, i.e., exponential LAMP cycling. In this stage, the FIP hybridizes to the loop, initiates strand synthesis, thereby displacing the F1 strand to form a new loop at the 3\u2019 end. The nucleotide addition step is repeated, followed by DNA extension that displaces the FIP strand and again forms a dumbbell-shaped DNA. Subsequent self-primed strand displacement DNA synthesis yields one complementary structure of the original stem-loop DNA and one gap repaired stem-loop DNA. Both of these products are used as a template by the BIP. The annealing and displacement cycles are repeated and as the reaction proceeds, the product grows to form long concatamers. The amplified products can be detected by indirect detection methods like turbidity and non-specific dyes [53].",

In this method, a set of target-specific primers, a nicking endonuclease, and a strand displacing DNA polymerase are used for isothermal unwinding and subsequent generation and amplification of these small fragments (Fig. 5\n). Insertion of a nicking enzyme recognition site inside the target sequence facilitates the amplification procedure. The DNA polymerase initiates primer extension at the nick created by a nicking enzyme and releases small oligonucleotide fragments. Repeated nicking, polymerization, and strand displacement result in linear amplification of these small oligonucleotides, and the amplicons generated can be detected using a variety of probe formats such as molecular beacons and lateral flow sandwich. The primary limitation of the NEAR reaction includes generation of a large number of non-specific products that not only inhibit the progression of the forward reaction, but also limit the detection sensitivity, and thus may require more specific and accurate amplification analysis methods for avoiding detection errors [68].",

            "text": "HDA is an isothermal process of DNA amplification that relies on the complementary strand displacing ability of a thermostable DNA helicase [73]. Using the free energy from ATP hydrolysis, helicase, in the presence of the accessory protein MutL, catalyzes the unwinding of the dsDNA (Fig. 6\n). The unwound ssDNA strands are then coated with ssDNA-binding proteins, and sequence-specific primers are hybridized at the 3\u2019-end of each ssDNA template. DNA polymerase extends the annealed primers and converts the ssDNA to dsDNA, which again acts as the substrate for helicase, thus initiating the subsequent rounds of the exponential amplification of the target sequence. Although helicases can unwind dsDNA at a single temperature, it has been observed that an initial heat-induced denaturation and annealing step can increase the amplification efficiency and the yield by 40%\u201360% [73]. The sensitivity, speed, and robustness of HDA assays can be further improved by restriction endonuclease-mediated DNA helicase homing, macromolecular crowding agents, and optimization of reaction enzyme mix [74]. HDA assays are critically dependent on primer design, and are often vulnerable to primer-dimer amplicon contamination [75]. Amplification of the primer-dimers in place of the target nucleic acid leads to erroneous detection and remains one of the major concerns for HDA based assays. Currently, HDA-based commercially available assays have been developed for the detection of HSV 1 & 2, Flu A & B, RSV, and hMPV. The HSV HDA assay has demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.2% and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 90.9% when compared to shell vial virus culture and immunofluorescence typing [76]. Like other isothermal reactions, HDA assays are rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, can be performed without sophisticated instrumentation, and can be successfully implemented in low resource settings [77].",

An initiating primer is annealed to the replication origin site of the circular template and the polymerase facilitates the continuous addition of nucleotides to the leading strand, resulting in long ssDNA or RNA with tandem repeats (Fig. 7\n). Depending on the number of annealed primers, RCA can be classified as linear RCA (produces up to 105 copies) or exponential RCA (produces up to 109 copies) [79]. In linear RCA, a single complementary primer generates a single amplified product that is linked to the initiating primer. Exponential RCA uses two primers, where the second primer binds to the ssDNA product of the first primer and initiates further amplification. Circulating oligonucleotide probes or padlock probes (PLPs) can further enhance the specificity and multiplexing ability of RCA [80]. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of these probes are designed to recognize adjacent sequences on the target strand, and when properly hybridized, the ends can be joined using ligase to result in circularized probes. Following circularization, the probe is replicated by RCA and the products are labeled and detected using various signal readout techniques such as gel electrophoresis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and microscopy [78]. High specificity is ensured since the hybridization and circularization can only occur when the target sequence is correctly recognized by both ends of the probe.",

Unlike PCR that relies on in vitro amplification of the target sequences, bDNA is based on a series of specific hybridization reactions and chemiluminescent detection of hybridized probes [84]. The assay uses multiple synthetic capture oligonucleotides (label extenders and capture extenders) that are hybridized to complementary regions of the target nucleic acid to form a sandwich complex of probes and target sequences (Fig. 8\n). The capture extenders can bind efficiently to the targeted nucleic acid sequences as well as the capture probes that are attached on an immobilized surface, such as a microtiter plate. Once the capture extenders are hybridized to the capture probes, the sample containing the viral nucleic acid is added for hybridization. Following hybridization, the label extenders are added to the mix and bind to contiguous regions on the target and also to a preamplifier oligonucleotide. Hybridization of the label extenders to the preamplifier molecule initiates the signal amplification process. The preamplifier molecule also harbors regions that hybridize to multiple bDNA amplifier molecules forming a branched structure. This branched structure is finally bound to alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled oligonucleotides, which are complementary to bDNA amplifier sequences. The chemiluminescent product of the AP reaction generates the bDNA signal that is directly proportional to the amount of DNA or RNA target present in the original sample.",

Since then, an updated version of the HPV hybrid capture assay (HC2) has been released that has demonstrated comparable performance with other molecular diagnostic methods and is considered to be a reliable and robust assay for cervical cancer screening. [[93], [94], [95]]. However, the HC2 HPV assay has a relatively lower analytical sensitivity (\u02dc5000 copies of HPV DNA) when compared to PCR [85]. But, for HPV screening, the clinical sensitivity and specificity are more important than analytical performance for predicting high-risk cases of cervical cancer over positive results which may be clinically irrelevant [96]. The primary limitation of the HC2 assay is its inability to distinguish between different strains of HPV which is essential for efficient risk analysis and to determine persistence of infection [97]. However, the future of hybrid capture assays seems questionable as the manufacturer appears to be more focused on traditional target amplification methodologies as well as other newer technologies [85].",

            "text": "Rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious pathogens has been proven paramount for improving the overall clinical outcomes in patients and for infection control. In the last two decades, molecular testing methods have considerably improved the diagnosis of viral pathogens and are often being considered as the new \u201cgold standard\u201d. While most of these methods are implemented routinely in the clinical virology laboratory, some are still used only for reference testing. Commercial assays based on the fundamentals of nucleic acid amplification have been extensively developed for the detection, identification, and quantification of relevant viral pathogens. Most of these assays require minimal hands-on time, have short turnaround times, can be automated, and can provide results directly from the specimen, thus eliminating lengthy pre- and post-processing steps. The primary advantage of molecular assays is their high sensitivity and specificity when compared to conventional diagnostic methods. However, with higher rates of pathogen detection, testing should be performed and the results analyzed based on the clinical signs and symptoms before initiating a specific treatment. Primary concerns for molecular assays are their complexity, the level of technical expertise required, and potentially high cost per test. However, many of these chemistries have evolved to moderate or low complexity sample-to-answer systems and are even achieving CLIA-waived point-of-care (POC) status. Although diagnostic companies are developing strategies to help reduce cost, clinical laboratories should evaluate their patient population, their size and capacity, and perform a cost-analysis for their specific setting before implementing specific tests.",
