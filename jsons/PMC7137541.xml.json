            "text": "Although the objects of study could not be smaller, particle physics is usually thought of as big science: big collaborations spanning hundreds or even thousands of scientists, and big questions. The scale and complexity of projects such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), based at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, also require very long timelines. The first discussions of what eventually became the LHC happened in the late 1970s, but the proton beams didn\u2019t start to circulate inside its 27-km-long tunnel until 40 years later. The LHC is scheduled to operate for another 15 years, but to ensure continuity in this field, the time to start planning the future of particle physics is now.",

In the run-up to the launch of the LHC in 2008, the priority was obvious: find the Higgs boson. Its discovery in 2012 marked a culmination of the efforts of thousands of physicists, technicians and engineers and, by the time the first update of the strategy came around in 20131, it also provided a very successful demonstration of the LHC\u2019s capabilities. However, as the excitement of the discovery faded, attention moved to the LHC\u2019s successor. By the time of the next update, it was decided, \u201cEurope needs to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN\u201d2.",

In their Perspective, Eva Sicking and Rickard Str\u00f6m discuss the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), a high-luminosity electron\u2013positron collider that would rely on a novel linear accelerator concept. The construction and operation of CLIC is envisaged in three stages, starting at energies of a few hundred GeV and eventually reaching the TeV range. Such energies would enable precision measurements of the Higgs boson and the top quark, in addition to searches for new physical phenomena.",

The interplay of the two stages would open up a broad spectrum of Higgs and electroweak measurements.",
