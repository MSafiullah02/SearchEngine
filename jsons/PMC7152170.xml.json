            "text": "Biologic and chemical weapons have been used throughout history.1 For millennia, indigenous South American peoples deliberately used plant-derived arrow poisons such as curare and toxins from poison dart frogs, although these preparations were used mainly for hunting. Similar toxins were used in Africa. The ancient Greeks, for whom toxikon meant \u201carrow poison,\u201d tipped arrows with winter aconite, and this practice continued into medieval Europe and persisted into the seventeenth century in Spain and Portugal.2 Soldiers in India used smoke screens, incendiary weapons, and toxic fumes as early as 2000 BCE, and the Sung Dynasty in China employed a wide variety of arsenical smokes and other poisons in battle. The military use of toxins dates from at least the sixth century bce, when Assyrian soldiers poisoned enemy wells with ergot-contaminated rye. In 423 bce, during the Peloponnesian War, Thracian allies of Sparta captured the Athenian fort at Delium by using a long tube and bellows to blow a poisonous smoke from coals, sulfur, and pitch into the fort. Greek fire (likely composed of rosin, sulfur, pitch, naphtha, lime, and saltpeter) was invented in the seventh century ce and proved to be a very effective naval weapon. Various poisons saw battlefield use during medieval times, and the use of poisons for murder (including assassinations) became widespread. Other examples before the twentieth century include the contamination of water by dumping the corpses of dead humans or animals into wells, the use of snakes and other creatures as poisonous vectors, and occasionally, fomites to transmit infections such as smallpox to unsuspecting victims. This latter technique was used with remarkable success during the French and Indian War (1754-1767), when Sir Jeffrey Amherst was alleged to have given \u201cgifts\u201d (blankets) harboring the pus and scabs from smallpox victims to unsuspecting Native American Indians. The Indians possessed no immunity against smallpox and thus experienced very high rates of infection and mortality as smallpox swept through the local tribes.3\n",

World War I saw the first large-scale use of \u201cpoison gas,\u201d including lacrimators, chlorine, phosgene, arsenicals, cyanide, and sulfur mustard. By the end of the war, nearly one in every three rounds was a chemical munition. Dr. Shiro Ishii and other Japanese scientists in the infamous Unit 731 worked on the weaponization of anthrax, plague, smallpox, and tetrodotoxin as well as a variety of chemical agents during World War II. There are even suspicions that the bomb used in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia in 1942 contained botulinum toxin.4 After World War II, ricin was used as an injectable assassination weapon, and in the 1970s and 1980s T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin, was alleged to have been the toxic component of the \u201cyellow rain\u201d employed against H'Mong refugees from Laos. More recently, Iraq and Iran both used chemical weapons against each other in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, and Iraq had a weapons program that included the development of sulfur mustard, nerve agents, \u201cAgent 15\u201d (an anticholinergic incapacitating agent), botulinum toxin, epsilon toxin from Clostridium perfringens, and aflatoxin.5 Militia groups in the United States and terrorist groups throughout the world have used ricin for political purposes.",

Since that time, at least 140 nations have either signed or ratified this treaty.6 However, the Soviet Union and Iraq began violating the treaty in short order. In the Soviet Union, weapons scientists stepped up research and development of numerous biologic and chemical weapons as part of one of the largest and most comprehensive biologic-weapons programs in history. Soviet scientists created large stockpiles of weaponized anthrax, plague, smallpox, tularemia, nerve agent, mustard, and other biologic and chemical agents.5\n",

In that year, a small quantity of weapons-grade anthrax was accidentally released from a manufacturing plant located in the former city of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in Russia. Seventy-seven cases and 66 deaths were reported. Dr. Matthew Meselson, a Harvard scientist, was permitted to study the event many years later and reported the results of his work in a 1979 Science article. Meselson determined that the majority of the deaths had occurred among victims living in a narrow 4-km-wide band downwind from the plant. Animal deaths were confirmed as far as 30 km downwind. Meselson further concluded that less than 1 g of weapons-grade anthrax had been released from the plant.7 If his calculations are accurate, weaponized anthrax possesses staggering potential as a biologic weapon given its stability, its relative ease of production, and its ability to be dispersed in a clandestine manner over great distances.",

In addition to weaponizing the etiologic agents of anthrax, smallpox, Marburg fever, and others, they created antibiotic-resistant strains of Yersinia pestis (plague), Francisella tularensis, and other pathogens.

As of May 2004, a large outbreak of avian influenza involving the H5N1 strain and human cases has been reported in two countries from this region.15 Thus far, no human-to-human transmission has been reported, but the potential exists for genetic reassortment between avian and human or animal strains of influenza. A recent report in the journal Science linked the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 epidemic to a possible avian origin.16 If true, avian influenza may pose a much greater danger to human populations than previously reported. The disease presents in humans in a fashion similar to other types of influenza viruses. It usually begins with fever, chills, headaches, and myalgias and often involves the upper and lower respiratory tract with development of cough, dyspnea, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Laboratory findings may include pancytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hypoxia, a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for H5N1, and a positive neutralization assay for H5N1 influenza strain. In vitro studies suggest that the neuraminidase (NA)-inhibitor class of drugs may have clinical efficacy in the treatment and prevention of avian influenza infection.17\n",

Additionally, genetic reassortment between avian and human or avian and porcine influenza viruses may lead to the major changes in HA or NA surface proteins known as antigenic shift. In contrast to the gradual evolution of strains subject to antigenic drift, antigenic shift occurs when an influenza virus with a completely novel HA or NA formation moves into humans from other host species.

The 1957\u20131958 pandemic caused 66,000 excess deaths, and the 1968 pandemic caused 34,000 excess deaths in the United States. The 1918 influenza pandemic illustrates a worst-case public health scenario; it caused 675,000 deaths in the United States and 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide.16 Morbidity in most communities was between 25% and 40%, and the case-mortality rate averaged 2.5%. A reemergent 1918-like influenza virus would have tremendous societal effects, even in the event that antiviral medications were effective against this more lethal influenza virus.",

A case was initially defined by clinical criteria; a suspected or probable case was defined as an illness that included potential exposure to an existing case and fever with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. In April 2003, a confirmed case was defined as a case from which SARS-CoV was isolated from culture.19 SARS-CoV infections have an incubation period of 2 to 10 days. Systemic symptoms such as fever and chills followed by a dry cough and shortness of breath begin within 2 to 7 days. Patients may develop pneumonia and lymphopenia by days 7 to 10 of the illness. Most patients with SARS-CoV have a clear history of exposure either to a patient with SARS or to a setting in which SARS-CoV is known to exist. Laboratory tests may be helpful but do not reliably detect infection early during the illness. SARS-CoV should be suspected in patients requiring hospitalization for radiographically confirmed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome of unknown etiology and one of the following risk factors during the 10 days prior to the onset of illness: (1) travel to China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with an ill person having a history of such travel; (2) employment in an occupation associated with a risk for SARS-CoV exposure; or (3) inclusion in a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis.",

All patients admitted to the hospital with suspected pneumonia should receive the following measures: (1) They should placed in droplet isolation until it is determined that isolation is no longer indicated (standard precautions are appropriate for most community- acquired pneumonias; droplet precautions for non-avian influenza); (2) they should be screened for risk factors of possible exposure to SARS-CoV; and (3) they should be evaluated with a chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, complete blood count, and additional workup as indicated. If the patient has a risk factor for SARS, droplet precautions should be implemented pending an etiologic diagnosis. When there is a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV disease, the patient should be treated in terms of SARS isolation precautions immediately (including airborne precautions), and all contacts of the ill patient should be identified, evaluated, and monitored.19 Although ribavirin, high-dose corticosteroids, and interferons have been used in treatment, it is unclear what effect they have had on clinical outcome. No definitive therapy has been established. Empiric antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia by the current American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines is recommended pending etiologic diagnosis. Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV include antibody testing using an enzyme immunoassay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory, blood, and stool specimens.20 In the absence of known SARS-CoV transmission, testing is recommended only in consultation with public health authorities. Testing for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococcus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and legionella should be conducted, since the identification of one of these agents excludes SARS by case definition. Clinical samples can be obtained during the first week of illness with a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a serum or a plasma specimen. After the first week of illness, a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a stool specimen should be obtained. Serum specimens for SARS-CoV antibody testing should be collected when the diagnosis is first suspected and at later times as indicated. An antibody response can occasionally be detected during the first week of illness, is likely to be detected by the end of the second week of illness, and at times may not be detected until more than 28 days after the onset of symptoms. Respiratory specimens from any of several different sources may be collected for viral and bacterial diagnostics, but the preferred specimens of choice are nasopharyngeal washes or aspirates.20\n",

Such knowledge has led to a deeper understanding of the development of basic immunity to a variety of different human infectious diseases. With this increase in scientific knowledge has come the power to manipulate the immune system at its most fundamental level.

Loopholes in existing agreements can be exploited to develop weapons that are technically not proscribed by international law. Goals and objectives may vary depending on whether military use is planned at the strategic, tactical, or operational level and whether the developer is a national government, a breakaway republic, a kidnapped or recruited scientist, or a terrorist cell. Risk of use may also differ depending on whether the targets are military versus civilian, human versus nonhuman (animals or plants, including livestock and crops), or individual (as in assassinations) versus large groups, and depending on whether the aim is death versus incapacitation. Risk also depends on agent availability and on the technology available for production, storage, and dissemination; current advances in technology are associated with a higher risk of weaponization. The fallibility of intelligence can be illustrated by two examples from the twentieth century and one from the twenty-first:1.During most of World War II, the Allied perception of risk from possible chemical-agent use by Axis powers focused on those agents, primarily pulmonary agents and vesicants, known from World War I. In fact, Germany had developed a new kind of chemical-warfare agent, the compounds later to be called G-series nerve agents. Their existence came as a complete surprise to Western governments when, in the waning days of the European campaign, Allied soldiers advancing into Germany discovered buried nerve-agent munitions and entire nerve-agent factories. Why these agents were never used on the battlefield is a topic of much speculation, but in retrospect they clearly posed the most lethal, yet unrecognized, threat from Germany.31\n2.Assessment of the chemical threat posed by Saddam Hussein at the time of the Gulf War of 1991 centered on the known Iraqi use of sulfur mustard and nerve agents during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. It was not until 1998 that Reuters News Agency reported the discovery by British intelligence that Iraq had stockpiled large quantities of a \u201cmental incapacitant\u201d (incapacitating agent) known as Agent 15.32\n3.The risk of use of chemical agents by Iraq after 2001 was assessed to be high partly because of the known stockpiles of sulfur mustard and nerve agents (as well as the suspected stockpiles of cyanide and the new revelations about Agent 15) from the time of the 1991 Gulf War. Although a full accounting has yet to be made, allegations have been made that most of the Iraqi chemical stockpile was actually destroyed in 1991 or soon afterward and that the risk of their use was actually very low. Whether those reports are true does not invalidate the argument that the risk from these agents was still very much debatable.\n",

Some compounds not developed to cause injury or incapacitation nevertheless can be very dangerous; HC smoke, for example, can cause the same type of pulmonary damage induced by phosgene. The CDC lists nearly 70 separate chemicals, including a variety of toxic industrial chemicals and poisons, as potential agents for terrorism. These include osmium tetroxide, long-acting anticoagulants, heavy metals, toxic alcohols, and white phosphorus.33 A recent issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Report includes an even longer list.34 Pyrolysis products from explosions and conflagrations may release large quantities of cyanide and other toxicants that, although different from the original chemicals present, may still cause death. Industrial chemicals are readily available in large quantities as preformed compounds and should be considered high on the list of potential terrorist agents.35,\n36 Toxins, which are chemicals produced within biologic organisms, also represent high-threat agents.37 New chemicals are currently being synthesized on rigid three-dimensional molecular skeletons, the most promising of which are the norbornanes. Building on norbornane geometry allows for a modular enhancement of the number of functional sites on a given molecule. Since many norbornane derivatives, such as the mixture of chlorobornanes known as the toxaphenes, are persistent and have significant acute and chronic toxicity, these derivatives have been considered potential candidates for new agents.38\n",

Only sketchy and unverifiable information is available in the unclassified literature, but the existence of these agents would demonstrate the possibility of creating new chemical compounds toxic enough to be used as chemical-warfare or terrorist agents. So-called GV analogs combining some of the properties of G-series and V-series nerve agents have also been suggested as potential new agents.38 The use in 2002 of an incapacitating gas (thought to be an opioid compound derived from fentanyl and possibly mixed with another anesthetic agent) in the siege of a Moscow theater taken over by Chechen rebels was evidence either of the deployment of a preexisting anesthetic agent or of a new anesthetic compound.43,\n44 Organofluorines have been investigated because of their reported ability to defeat protective-mask or chemical-filtrations systems.38 Other incapacitating agents under development exert primarily physical rather than chemical effects and include immobilizing agents (\u201cstickums\u201d), antitraction gels (\u201cslickums\u201d), and malodorants.45\n",

The idea was to make storage of chemical rounds safer by stopping the production process at the penultimate synthetic step, resulting in two precursor compounds that when mixed would create the desired agent. These two precursors could then be stored separately. Just prior to use, one component could be inserted into a round, where it would be separated from the other precursor by a thin membrane. The impact and momentum of the launch of the projectile would burst the membrane to allow for mixing of the components and in-flight production of the chemical agent. In practice, this process was often not complete, but the 20% or so of ancillary reaction product was often extremely toxic by itself. Binarization or some similar production-arrest method could theoretically be used by a clandestine terrorist cell to help evade detection and to decrease the risks associated with the production, transportation, and use of chemical agents.",

Targeting unusual sequences of high prevalence in certain populations raises the specter of genomic, or ethnic, weapons, as previously described. Less appreciated is the potential for genomics to be used to develop drugs, chemical or toxin agents that can also be targeted to specific variants within a population of humans, animals, or crops.
