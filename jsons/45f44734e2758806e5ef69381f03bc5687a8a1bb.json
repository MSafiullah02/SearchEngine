This attractive feature of poly-L-lysine makes it very convenient for bioactive molecule attachment. This study details the preparation of poly-L-lysine-based pencil graphite electrodes (PLL/PGEs) and use of the coated electrodes for direct ultrasensitive DNA hybridization detection. In the first part of this study, poly-L-lysine coated electrodes were prepared using L-lysine as the monomer by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with different cyclic scans. The effect of these cyclic scans during the electropolymerization was investigated. Coated electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron micro-scopy (SEM). Then, one-pot preparation of poly-L-lysine composites with graphene (GN) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto the pencil graphite electrodes were achieved. Electrochemical responses of these 3 electrodes were compared. After all, electrochemical DNA hybridization was performed using the poly-Llysine-based electrodes prepared at optimum polymerization condition. The PLL/PGE coated electrode presented a good linear response in the target concentration range of 1.0 3 10 \u00c013 to 1.0 3 10 \u00c06 with a detection limit of 2.25 3 10 \u00c014 using differential pulse voltammetry as the detection method. We believe that poly-L-lysine-based surfaces will be useful for further clinical applications.",

The detection of specific DNA sequences, DNA damage and DNA-anticancer drug interactions have been the hot topics of all times since they are directly related to human health [1] [2] [3] [4] . They have found many applications in medicine, pharmacy, molecular biology, environmental monitoring and food safety. In particular, detection of specific DNA sequences is great importance for the diagnosis of diseases, genomic sequencing and pathogen identification [5] [6] [7] [8] . There are several ways of detecting DNA and monitoring DNA-related studies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, spectroscopybased or biosensor-based [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Among these techniques, DNA biosensors constitute an important place due to their advantage of recognizing base pairs efficiently in shorter time values compared to laborious classical methods. Biosensors that use electrochemical transducers have been used commonly in order to construct sensitive, selective, inexpensive, rapid, simple and miniaturized biosensing platforms [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

In this context, Prof. Joseph Wang's group have made significant contributions to the electrochemical DNA biosensors. For example, Wang et al. have used electrochemical stripping detection of colloidal gold tag for DNA hybridization at single-use thick film carbon electrodes [20] . In their study, magnetic bead-linked oligonucleotide probe and target hybridization have been followed by binding of streptavidin-coated metal nanoparticles to the captured DNA and dissolution of gold. Another remarkable study has been performed using a ternary monolayer involving hexanedithiol (HDT) co-immobilized with a thiolated capture probe on gold surfaces by Campuzano et al. [21] . 6mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) has been used as the diluent of the ternary monolayer. This ternary monolayer has presented a quantification of target DNA down to 7 pM and 17 pM in untreated serum and urine samples, respectively. Then, Kuralay et al. have used this ternary monolayer approach at screen-printed gold electrodes (Au/SPEs) [22] . A quantification of target DNA down to 25 pM and 100 pM in untreated serum and urine samples have been obtained, respectively.",

They have attracted great attention in DNA sensing because of their availability of forming roboust, uniform and biocompatible surfaces having charges or their own functional groups which make them very convenient for biomolecule immobilization [23] [24] [25] [26] . Besides these advantages, many of them have good conductivities, porous structures and high electroactive surface areas. Their easy preparation is commonly rely on the electrochemical oxidation of their monomers in the presence of a dopant molecule [27] [28] [29] [30] . Gu et al. have fabricated polyaniline/polyacrylate (PANI/PAA)modified boron-doped diamond electrode for electrochemical impedance sensing of DNA hydridization [31] . The electrode has presented a detection limit of 2 3 10 \u00c08 M. Another DNA biosensor with polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) PANI has been constructed by Hui et al. [32] . The biosensor has exhibited a response to breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1) with a linear range from 0.01 pM to 1 nM. Prof. Joseph Wang's group have electropolymerized polypyrrole (PPy) in the presence of nucleic acid probes as the dopant molecules. The probes have served as the sole counter anion during the electropolymerization and maintained their hybridization activity [33] . Jiang and Wang have also demonstrated a genoelectronic route for discriminating between short oligonucleotides and chromosomal DNA. This route has been depended on the electropolymeric growth of PPy. The response of system has found proportional to the concentration of the oligonucleotide dopant [34] . Peptide modified poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been used for BRCA1 detection and a detection limit of 0.03 fM has been found. The biosensor has exhibited a satisfying accuracy and low fouling in 5 % (v/v) human plasma [35] .",

Jiang et al. have been presented an electrochemical biosensor with poly-L-lysine/single walled carbon nanotubes for EIS detection of PAT gene fragment and PCR amplification of NOS gene [39] . Carboxylic group-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been dropped onto the carbon paste electrode (CPE) and then PLL films have been electropolymerized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The detection limit has been 3.1 3 10 \u00c013 M using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Another DNA biosensor based on functionalized graphene oxide and poly-L-lysine modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been constructed by Sun et al. for the detection of tlh gene sequence related to vibrio parahaemolyticus [40] . PLL films have been electropolymerized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and functionalized graphene modification has been performed subsequently by dropping onto the coated electrode. Hybridization event has been monitored with methylene blue. The detection limit has been found as 1.69 3 10 \u00c013 M. A genesensor to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus has been prepared on poly-L-ysine modified screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) [41] . Enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the 3indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) to indigo has been monitored by cyclic voltammetry. In the second part, the target has been labeled using an Au (I) complex. The detection limits have been found as 8 pM and 0.5 nM, respectively. In our study, we present a simple protocol based on the electropolymerization of L-lysine onto disposable pencil graphite electrodes (PLL/PGEs) by cyclic voltammetry. PLL/PGEs were prepared using various cyclic scans (5, 10 and 15 cycles) in order to investigate the effect of polymeric film thickness on the electrochemical response of the coated electrode. The response of the coated surface was also compared with the response of the uncoated electrode for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) detection. Improved results were obtained with the coated one. Thus, we used the coated electrode in DNA hybridization sensing in 1 : 1 diluted serum samples. According to our knowledge, this is the first to fabricate PLL coated pencil graphite surfaces and to present their application as DNA biosensor in serum samples. The hybridization step didn't require any indicator step and oxidation signals of guanine (G) was used, directly. The prepared electrode presented a sensitive and selective response towards label-free DNA detection. Besides this, herein we fabricated poly-L-lysine/ graphene (PLL/GN) and poly-L-lysine/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PLL/MWCNTs) nanocomposites coated PGEs. The electroactive polymer/nanomaterials-based nanocomposites coated surfaces have attracted great attention for different applications [4] . This is the first to demonstrate one-pot, rapid, robust and easy fabrication of polyamino acids/nanomaterials composites coated disposable surfaces in the literature. Electrochemical polymerization was performed with L-lysine monomer in the presence of graphene or multi-walled carbon nanotubes onto the PGEs. Electrochemical characterization was performed and also the response of the coated electrodes for DNA biosensing was compared.",

Well-defined peaks due to the oxidation and reduction of redox probe were obtained with the coating of graphite surface with PLL. SI Table 1 summarizes the anodic/cathodic peak potentials (E pa /E pc ), the anodic/ cathodic peak currents (I pa /I pc ). Best electrochemical response was achieved with thinner PLL layer onto the PGE. We evaluate the increasing polymerization cyclic scans as the indicator of the polymeric film thickness [42] . Thus, with the increasing polymeric film thickness, reversibility and the oxidation/reduction peak currents of redox probe were decreased proportionally. However, this decrease was not a dramatic one. Our results proved the advantage of integration of PLL layer with pencil graphite surface. 3.5-fold increase in the oxidation of the redox probe and 4.5-fold increase in the reduction of the redox probe were found with the coated electrode prepared with 5 cycles of electropolymerization compared to the uncoated electrode.",

            "text": "Surface characterization of PLL/PGEs and uncoated PGE was carried out with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 4A presents the SEM images of uncoated (bare) PGE ( Figure 4A ) at magnitudes of 50 mm, 10 mm and 5 mm. The graphite layers were clearly seen in these images in parallel to the literature [43, 44] . SEM images of PLL/PGE prepared with 5 cyclic scans ( Figure 4B ) and PLL/PGE prepared with 10 cyclic scans ( Figure 4C ) were also given at the same magnitudes. It is clear from the images that after the modification of the electrode surfaces with PLL, the morphology of the new surfaces changed. The polymeric film formation on the graphite layers of the bare electrode was obvious in each cases compared to the uncoated PGE. The fabrication of electroactive polymer/nanomaterials composites on various electrode materials have attracted great attention for different applications. In addition, their one-pot synthesis onto electrodes are among very important topics [4, 46] . After the optimization studies for PLL/PGEs, we demonstrated the first example of one-pot, rapid, robust and easy fabrication of polyamino acid/nanomaterials composites coated disposable surfaces in the literature. Electrochemical polymerization was performed with L-lysine monomer in the presence of graphene (GN) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto the PGEs using 5 cyclic scans. 6 3\u00c0/4 , respectively. As seen from these cyclic voltammetric behaviors all coated electrodes exhibited very good electrochemical responses compared to the bare elec-trode. In addition, SI Table 2 summarizes the anodic/ cathodic peak potentials (E pa /E pc ) and the anodic/cathodic 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 peak currents (I pa /I pc ). According to these results, the reversibility of the electrodes were better in the presence of graphene or multi-walled carbon nanotubes as expected. The best performance was obtained with the PLL/ GN/PGE. The results emphasized the catalytical effect of nanomaterials on the electrode material. However, the peak currents which was related to the effective areas were almost the same for 3 electrodes [4] . After the electropolymerization and characterization studies, we present the application of PLL-based pencil graphite electrodes for DNA biosensing. The outer layer of the electrode serves as a positively/negatively charged surface in order to bind DNA electrostatically. The electropolymerization condition was kept as 5 cycles of polymerization since the PLL coated electrode showed the best electrochemical response at this working condition. Firstly, the advantage of the coated electrodes was presented by using them in 100 mg L \u00c01 dsDNA solution. In Figure 6A -a to d, differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) of PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE, PPL/ PGE and uncoated PGE in dsDNA solution prepared in acetate buffer (pH 4.8) were overlaid. As seen from these DPVs, electroactive 4 DNA bases (guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), respectively) were able to be differentiated in a good seperation in the same current scale by using PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE and PLL/PGE. PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE and PLL/ PGE exhibited almost the same behavior. The separations of adenine (A) and thymine (T) were slightly more sensitive by using the PLL/GN/PGE and there was also a catalytic effect in parallel to our cyclic voltammetric results with the PLL/GN/PGE and PLL/MWCNTs/PGE. However, there was no clear seperation of the DNA bases using uncoated PGE and the peak currents were in a lower current values compared to the ones obtained with PLL-based electrodes. These results signified the use of PLL-based surfaces for DNA biosensing. Then, the usability of PLL/PGE electrode was presented in human serum which was diluted with acetate buffer (pH 4.8) in 1 : 1 ratio. The experiments for %100 serum sample for the differentiation of DNA bases was also performed. However, the sensitivity was poor in these results. Figure 6B In the last part of the study, DNA hybridization was investigated with PLL/PGEs and PLL/GN/PGEs. The effect of probe DNA immobilization time was examined by immersing the PLL/PGEs into the probe DNA solution for 15 min (SI Figure 1a) , 30 min (SI Figure 1b) and 60 min (SI Figure 1c) . Adenine oxidation peak was used to monitor the changes using differential pulse voltammetry. As seen from these results, the oxidation peak gave the best response at 30 min of probe immobilization. Thus, 30 min probe DNA immobilization time was used in further studies.",

            "text": "). Furthermore, for the first time in the literature the fabrication of one-pot synthesis of polyamino acid/nanomaterials coated electrodes was achieved. Cyclic voltammetric behaviors of all PLL-based electrodes exhibited very good electrochemical responses compared to the bare electrode. The results also emphasized the catalytical effect of nanomaterials on the electrode material. The PLL-based surfaces exhibited a good discrimination of electroactive DNA bases in a high sensitivity, while uncoated PGE gave poor results. In the last part of the study, DNA hybridization was performed with PLL/PGE and PLL/GN/PGE. The electrodes presented a good linear response, high sensitivity and selectivity and good reproducibility for target DNA prepared in diluted serum samples (50 % serum). The hybridization step didn't require any indicator step in the study and the prepared electrodes presented a sensitive and selective response towards labelfree DNA detection. Therefore, disposable PLL-based PGEs can be used for further routine clinical applications .  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 ",
