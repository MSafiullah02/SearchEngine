In all cases, this panel included culture for Salmonella spp. by selective enrichment in selenite cystine broth,\n14\n detection of viruses by electron microscopy and rotavirus ELISA,\na\n detection of C. difficile toxin A and B by ELISA,\nb\n anaerobic culture for C. perfringens, detection of Cryptosporidium spp. by modified acid\u2010fast stain,\nc\n and detection of gastrointestinal parasite ova by flotation. Most C. perfringens isolates cultured were submitted to an outside laboratory for amplification of alpha, beta, beta\u20102, epsilon, iota, and enterotoxin genes by multiplex PCR.\nd\n For all foals admitted after 2004, C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) ELISA\ne\n was also performed.

Initial screening of potential factors associated with survival was performed by use of univariate logistic regression. Variables for which the screening P value was < .10 were included in the multivariate model. The multivariate model was a backward stepwise model, whereby variables were removed sequentially starting with that having the largest P value.

Foals were then grouped based on the infectious agent detected in the feces (or lack thereof). Differences in the median ages between foals with various infectious agents were compared with a Kruskal\u2010Wallis 1 way ANOVA on ranks and multiple pairwise comparisons were performed with Dunn's method. Finally, foals were divided in 4 groups based on the infectious agents most commonly detected in the feces (C. perfringens, C. difficile, Salmonella spp., and rotavirus). Virtually all coinfections involved detection of a parasite (Parascaris equorum, Strongylus spp., Giardia spp., Trichostrongylus spp.) along with Salmonella, C. difficile, or rotavirus. Because these parasites are not typically recognized as causes of diarrhea in foals, they were grouped based on the bacterial or viral agent detected. In preliminary analyses, age was found to be significantly different between groups. Because many clinical examination parameters and laboratory variables vary according to age, a general linear model with age as a covariate was used to compare continuous variables between the 4 groups. When necessary, the data were log\u2010transformed to meet the assumptions for parametric testing. Multiple pairwise comparisons adjusted for age were done with the Holm\u2010Sidak test. Dichotomous variables were compared between the 4 groups using multinomial logistic regression with age as a covariate. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the rotavirus ELISA were calculated using electron microscopy as the gold standard. Agreement between rotavirus ELISA and electron microscopy as well as agreement between C. perfringens culture and CPE ELISA were assessed using the \u03ba statistic. \u03ba differentiates between poor (\u03ba < 20), fair (0.21\u20130.40), moderate (0.41\u20130.60), good (0.61\u20130.80), and very good (0.81\u20131.00) agreement between tests without the need to identify a gold standard.\n16\n For all analyses, significance was set at P\u2264 .05.",

The identification of infectious organisms was common in this population of foals with diarrhea, with over 54% of samples being positive for 1 or more organism. However, the main limitation of this study is the lack of a control population of hospitalized foals without diarrhea subjected to the same fecal diagnostic testing. As a result, the present study cannot establish whether or not there is an association between detection of a given infectious agent in the feces and presence of diarrhea. Detection of 1 or multiple infectious agents in the feces of diarrheic foals does not necessarily indicate that these agents are the cause of disease. Nevertheless, in clinical situations, detection of infectious agents in the feces is the method used to establish a diagnosis and formulate a therapeutic plan. The fecal screening panel in the present study was only performed at the time of admission or as soon as possible after the onset of diarrhea within 48 hours of admission. Repeated testing would have likely enhanced our ability to identify infectious agents in this population. Including the foals with diarrhea on admission only would have introduced a bias by excluding many foals with enterocolitis that present with nonspecific signs such as fever, anorexia, colic, or lethargy. Many of these foals have enterocolitis on admission but they do not develop diarrhea until later. On the other hand, inclusion of foals that developed diarrhea after several days of hospitalization may have been a confounding factor by including cases associated with antimicrobial therapy or nosocomial infection. As a compromise, we included foals that developed diarrhea within 48 hours of admission. Finally, the sensitivities and specificities of diagnostic tests likely vary for different agents, which may affect the relative prevalence of detection of some infectious agents.",

In the present study, 7 of 12 (58%) foals with a positive Salmonella culture had a blood culture positive for at least 1 microorganism. Two of 4 foals, which grew Salmonella from a blood culture, were also positive for Salmonella in the feces. These results differ slightly from a previous report in which 64% of 22 Salmonella shedders were blood culture positive and all 8 foals who had Salmonella bacteremia were also fecal shedders.\n22\n This can be explained by the fact that Salmonella was more likely to be cultured from the feces of foals > 1 month of age in the present study and older foals were significantly less likely to be bacteremic.",

One previous study identified a significant association between the identification of S. westeri and the presence of diarrhea in foals.\n6\n In the current study, P. equorum was the most commonly identified parasite. P. equorum is a documented cause of colic, mild respiratory disease, and overall poor doing in foals. Diarrhea has not been shown to be related to infection with this pathogen. In 8 of 10 foals from which P. equorum was identified, a 2nd infectious agent was also detected in the feces. This suggests that, although Parascaris ova were present, they were probably not the cause of diarrhea. It is not surprising that foals >1 month were significantly more likely to have parasite ova identified in their feces. Parascaris and Strongylus ova were most commonly identified in the present population. With the exception of S. westerii, these parasites have prepatent periods ranging from 4 weeks to 6 months. Giardia was the only infectious agent identified in 2 foals. The role of Giardia in equine diarrhea is poorly understood.",

In both studies, approximately 50% of the blood cultures were positive for at least 1 microorganism. However, the frequency of isolation or microorganisms was considerably different between the 2 studies. Gram\u2010negative bacteria (75 versus 57% of isolates) and E. coli (36 versus 11% of isolates) were isolated more frequently in our population, whereas Enterococcus spp. (11 versus 29% of isolates) was identified more frequently at the University of Pennsylvania.\n22\n This could simply reflect differences in geographic area, ambient temperature, or climate.",

In contrast, there was a significant effect of the infectious agent detected in the feces on WBC, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts as well as cell toxicity, sepsis score, and fibrinogen, phosphorus and total calcium concentrations. Because of the small number of animals in each category, a lack of significant difference in a given laboratory variable between groups must be taken cautiously due to the low statistical power of such comparison. There was no relationship between blood culture status and survival as also reported by Hollis et al.\n22\n In a recent retrospective study of 423 bacteremic foals, presence of diarrhea was associated with higher odds of survival.\n23\n In the present study, sepsis score was not associated with blood culture results. Using the reported cut\u2010off of 11, the sensitivity and specificity of sepsis score to predict a positive blood culture were 41 and 64%, respectively. The low sensitivity and specificity of the sepsis score in predicting blood culture results has also been recognized in prior studies.\n24\n, \n25\n However, sepsis score was a good indicator of outcome in the current study with odds of survival 6.1 times lower in foals with a sepsis score \u2265 14 than in foals with a lower sepsis score on admission. It is likely that sepsis score is a better indicator of severe sepsis and subsequently survival rather than just sepsis or bacteremia.",
