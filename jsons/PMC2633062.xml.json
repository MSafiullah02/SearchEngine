            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). SARS was detected for the first time in the Guandong province of China in late 2002, spread rapidly around the World and resulted in more than 8000 cases, 10% of which resulted in death, in 33 countries, and areas of five continents (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mguide sars.en.html). World Healh organization (WHO) declared the end of the SARS outbreak in July 5th 2003, nevertheless, several isolated outbreaks subsequently occurred because of accidental contaminations in laboratories of Taiwan, Singapore, and mainland China (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). In late 2003 and early 2004, newly infected persons who had contact with animals infected with SARS-CoV strains significantly different from those predominating in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak were reported in Guandong, China (Peiris et al., 2004). These events indicate that a SARS epidemic may recur at any time in the future, although this event most likely would require the generation of new isolates evolving from SARS-CoV-like virus circulating in animals (Jiang et al., 2005). As a consequence of this possibility, and because SARS-CoV could be used as a biological weapon, it has been declared as a category C priority pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Biodefense (http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc priority.htm).",

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats, and has been amplified in other species, preferentially civets (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2006). The SARS-CoV like viruses that exist in animals do not cause typical SARS-like disease in the natural host and are not easily transmitted from animals to humans. Under certain conditions, the virus may have evolved into the early human SARS-CoV, with the ability to be transmitted from animals to humans and from humans to humans, resulting in localized outbreaks and mild human disease (Jiang et al., 2005). In fact, the virus most likely crossed the species barrier before the 2002 outbreak, as sera samples collected in 2001 were positive in 1.8% of the cases (Zheng et al., 2004). Furthermore, 40% of animal traders, whereas only a 5% of vegetable traders in Guandong markets were seropositive for SARS-CoV without showing signs of disease (Guan et al., 2003).",

Several types of vaccines are being developed, including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This paper will review previously published SARS vaccination strategies and announce new accomplishments in SARS-CoV based vaccination approaches while focusing on the correlates of protection, detected serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome.",

            "text": "The neutralization of a set of eight pseudoviruses expressing the spike glycoprotein of eight SARS-CoV strains selected from the three phases of the SARS epidemic (early, middle and late), plus another human isolate collected at the end of 2003 (GD03), and two civet cat isolates from 2003 (SZ16 and SZ3) has been studied (Chinese-Consortium, 2004, Yang et al., 2005). Human monoclonal antibodies against the S protein of the Frankfurt isolate (FRA-1), derived from Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphocytes were used. The virus tested in the neutralization assays included pseudotypes made with the S protein from members of the four main genetic clusters defined with the Bayesian analysis of the SARS-CoV glycoproteins (Fig. 1A) (Deming et al., 2006):(i)Group 1, originating from animals isolated in 2003. A prototype of this group is the isolate SZ16 which primarily uses civet but not human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor.(ii)Group 2, low pathogenic viruses originating from civets, raccoon dogs, or sporadic human cases, such as strain GD03 reported from a sporadic SARS case in December 22, 2003. This virus represented an independent introduction of a less pathogenic virus, having an S glycoprotein sequence that is the most divergent of all human strains (Chinese-Consortium, 2004). In general, group 2 isolates appear to have a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is capable of recognizing the human ACE2 receptor, and have been successfully cultured. GD03 S glycoprotein contains 18 amino acid substitutions relative to group 3 Urbani S protein, many of which map within neutralizing epitopes between amino acids 130\u2013150 and 318\u2013510, corresponding to the RBD. Recombinant viruses encoding the GD03 S glycoprotein have been isolated using reverse genetics (Baric et al., 2006). Recombinant icGD03 virus replicates about 0.5\u20131.0 logs less efficiently in human airway epithelial cells (6.8 \u00d7 107\n PFU/ml) as compared to wt Urbani (3.0 \u00d7 107\n PFU/ml) at 42 h postinfection.(iii)Group 3, highly pathogenic viruses representing the 2002\u20132003 epidemic strains associated with the early, middle, or late phase. Prototypes of these viruses are the early isolate and middle isolates GZ02, and CUHK-W, respectively, and the late Urbani, FRA-1, or Toronto 2 (TOR-2) strains.(iv)Group 4, bat SARS-CoV strains have not been successfully cultured but were sequenced from samples taken from Rhinolophus spp. like the Chinese horseshoe bat. These viruses differ from Urbani by about 12\u201322% in amino acid sequence and generally have about 3\u20134 out of 13 contact interface residues with human ACE2 receptor. Using the S glycoprotein gene, an unrooted Bayesian analysis suggests that bat strains are most closely related to early phase human strains.\n",

In addition, six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species have been described (Woo et al., 2006). Four of these coronaviruses belong to group 1, and two of them to group 2. Based on sequence data these authors have proposed the classification of bat CoV in three subgroups (2a, 2b, and 2c). Subgroup 2b comprises both SARS-CoV and a bat-SARS-CoV (Rp3 isolate). The sequences of these SARS-CoV isolates differ in the S1 domain of the S protein, where sequence identity fell to 64%. This sequence divergence in the S1 domain corroborated the serum neutralization studies, which indicate that although bat sera have a high level of cross-reactive antibodies, they failed to neutralize human or civet cat SARS-CoV when tested in Vero E6 cells (Li et al., 2005). In contrast, other authors (Lau et al., 2005) have reported that 42% of the bat sera samples tested neutralized human SARS-CoV isolate (HKU-39849) using FRhK-4 cells. The discrepancy could be due to the presence of a different SARS-CoV-like virus serotype in the bats studied by the two different groups, or to the two test systems used in the evaluation. Consequently vaccine design should take into account this antigenic diversity. Interestingly, recent characterization of the antigenic structure of SARS-CoV S protein with a large panel of Mabs has shown that at least one epitope providing susceptibility to SARS-CoV that maps in the RBD for ACE-2 is highly conserved in most virus strains and therefore, may confer protection to most SARS-CoV strains (He et al., 2006).",

SARS-CoV S, 3a, E, and M proteins are viral membrane proteins with domains exposed to the external face of the virus (Ito et al., 2005, Shen et al., 2005) that, in principle, could be involved in protection by induction of neutralizing antibodies. It has been shown that proteins S and 3a induce in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, with S protein being the main component of protective immunity (Qiu et al., 2005, Saif, 2004). Although strong immune responses are elicited against both S and N proteins (Buchholz et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2004), passive transfer studies illustrate that only S-specific antibodies confer protection from SARS-CoV replication in the mouse model (Bisht et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The relevance of S protein in protection against SARS-CoV has been reinforced by the identification of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients. The majority of the coronavirus neutralizing epitopes are located within the spike protein of the virus (Buchholz et al., 2004, Hogan et al., 2004). Two domains are defined in the spike protein, the amino-terminus (S1) and the carboxy-terminus (S2) halves. In some coronaviruses, but apparently not in the case of SARS-CoV, the S protein is processed in these two halves (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005, Wong et al., 2004). Recent evidence has determined that SARS-CoV neutralization is sensitive to deglycosylation of the spike protein, suggesting that conformational epitopes are important in antibody recognition (Song et al., 2004). The RBD located in the S1 subunit of S protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes. This suggests that recombinant proteins containing RBD, and vectors encoding the RBD sequence, can be used to develop safe and effective SARS vaccines (Jiang et al., 2005). The continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent SARS patients have been identified by biopanning with a M13 phage display dodecapeptide library (Zhong et al., 2005). These epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments, one on each of the spike, nucleocapsid, 3a, 9b and nsp3 proteins. Immunoassays found that most of the patients (82%) that recovered from SARS developed antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike S2 domain, indicating that this domain also is an immunodominant site on the S protein. These S2-targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV. Moreover, it is possible that S2-specific antibodies provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from viral infection (Zhong et al., 2005). In fact, among the rabbit antibodies elicited by different fragments covering the entire S protein expressed in E. coli, some of them were specific for aa 1029\u20131192, which include the heptad-repeat sequence of the S2 domain that interacts to form S protein trimers, and had neutralizing activities, indicating that this region of the S protein also carries neutralizing epitopes.",

Interestingly, in two separate cohorts of SARS patients, one from Taiwan (Liu et al., 2004) and the other from Hong Kong (Zhong et al., 2005), B cells recognizing the N-terminal region of 3a protein were isolated from patients. Moreover, significant proportion (40%) of the convalescent SARS patients examined in a dot blot assay using a synthetic peptide with a sequence corresponding to amino acids 12\u201327 of the N terminus of the protein were positive (Zhong et al., 2005). In addition, it was recently reported that the N-terminal domain of 3a protein elicits strong and potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients (Zhong et al., 2006). Accordingly, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 15\u201328 of 3a protein inhibit SARS-CoV propagation in Vero E6 cells, in contrast to antibodies specific for the C-terminal domain of the protein (Akerstrom et al., 2006).",

Consistent with the TGEV data described above, it has been shown that SARS-CoV M protein also induced virus neutralizing antibodies in the absence of complement (Buchholz et al., 2004). In addition, a mixture of S and M proteins showed a synergistic effect in the in vitro synthesis of TGEV neutralizing antibodies by immune leukocytes (Anton et al., 1995). In the case of SARS-CoV, immunization of hamsters with a parainfluenza virus vector has shown a differential role of S, M, E, or N proteins in protection (Buchholz et al., 2004). Parainfluenza virus expressing S protein alone provided complete protection against SARS-CoV challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. This protection was slightly augmented by co-expression with M and E proteins (Buchholz et al., 2004). Nevertheless, expression of M, E, or N proteins in the absence of S protein did not confer detectable protection. These results identify S as a main SARS-CoV neutralization and protective antigen among the structural proteins, and confers a limited role to SARS-CoV M protein in protection.",

However, SARS-CoV N protein induces T-cell responses (Gao et al., 2003). Accordingly, DNA immunization using SARS-CoV N gene induces potent Th1 polarized immune responses in mice, as well as specific antibodies in these animals. In fact, the highest levels of humoral response and T cell proliferation activity were induced by the N gene construct (Jin et al., 2005). Analysis of the immune response to another coronavirus (TGEV), using an in vitro antibody synthesis system, has shown that the optimum combination of viral proteins to stimulate the production of TGEV neutralizing antibodies in vitro was a mixture of S and N proteins, or a combination of S protein oligomers (rosettes) and the N or N protein-derived peptides (Anton et al., 1996, Anton et al., 1995). These data, in principle, suggest that N protein could be used in a vaccine to promote the synthesis of S-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

Passive transfer of these monoclonal antibodies or immune serum into na\u00efve mice protected them from infection with SARS-CoV (Subbarao et al., 2004). Using Epstein-Barr virus transformed human B cells, the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from SARS-CoV infection has been rescued (Traggiai et al., 2004). Some of the monoclonal antibodies exhibited neutralization activity in vitro, and some of them also conferred protection in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection. In addition, human IgG monoclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV developed using phage display libraries protected ferret from lung disease and virus shedding in pharyngeal secretions (ter Meulen et al., 2004). In both mouse and ferret models, administration of human monoclonal antibodies with in vitro neutralization activity reduced SARS-CoV titers in the lungs 3 to 6-log10-unit, protecting from lung pathology in ferrets (ter Meulen et al., 2004). Overall, these data indicate that humoral immune responses alone can protect against SARS.",

These data suggest that the NK cells and the adaptative immune response were not essential for virus clearance in mice. Possibly, interferon pathways were relevant in viral clearance. The importance of interferon response was reinforced by infecting Stat1-deficient mice with SARS-CoV (Hogan et al., 2004). Stat1 is important to the regulation of interferons, and Stat1-deficient mice produced one hundred-fold increase in viral titer over control mice. Additionally, the mutant mice developed interstitial pneumonia, not seen in control mice (Hogan et al., 2004) but not alveolar damage, as seen in lungs of human patients. It is unclear at this time if the observed pathological differences between human and Stat 1-deficient mouse lungs were due to time of sampling or to differences in host responses (Hogan et al., 2004).",

Although many types of vaccines for SARS-CoV have been attempted such as expression of recombinant proteins, or the use of virus vectors, these vaccines require considerable research set-up time (Bradbury, 2003). Therefore, the classical approach using inactivated, cell-culture based SARS-CoV is likely to be the easiest way for SARS vaccine development, based on the experience with available vaccines including inactivated or live polio and rabies vaccines (Montagnon, 1989, Zhou et al., 2005).

Secretion of these VLPs to the extracellular media required the co-expression of S protein (Mortola and Roy, 2004). In these experiments secretion of VLPs was relatively efficient (200 \u03bcg per 1 \u00d7 109 infected cells). These results are at variance with those obtained by expressing SARS-CoV proteins in human 293 renal epithelial cells under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, using DNA plasmids (Huang et al., 2004). In this system, any combination of genes that expressed M and N proteins, with or without S or E proteins, generated intracellular VLPs, and the pseudoparticles did not form in the absence of the M and N proteins. No single viral gene was able to support the formation of viral capsids within these cells. The additional expression of the S protein allowed the formation of budding particles with morphology typical of SARS and related coronaviruses. Different types of VLPs could be formed depending of the protein composition of these SARS-CoV VLPs. Protection by the administration of VLPs has not been reported.",

Viral replication was reduced more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors.

By contrast, passive transfer of purified IgG from immunized mice, but not control IgG provided immune protection against SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2004).

Whole-killed virus vaccine was more effective in conferring protective immunity against live SARS-CoV (See et al., 2006). Other adenovirus vaccines tested in mice have expressed either the S or the N protein (Zakhartchouk et al., 2005b) and shown that the S2 domain and the N protein contain strong T-cell epitopes, but reported no challenge experiments. In the monkey model, adenovirus-based vaccines induce strong SARS-CoV-specific immune responses, indicating that these vectors are promising vaccine candidates but, again, no information on protection have been provided (Gao et al., 2003). The adenovirus Ad5 vector with a deletion in the E1 and E3 regions, have also been used to express the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein (490 aa) (Liu et al., 2005). Wistar rats immunized three times throughout consecutive weeks produce antiserum capable of protecting from SARS-CoV infection in cell culture. Histopathological examination found no evident side effects in the immunized animals. Nevertheless, in vivo protection experiments were not performed. Therefore, additional experiments are required with the adenovirus based SARS vaccines.",

            "text": "Severe disease and high death rates were noted in senescent human populations infected with SARS-CoV, while children under 12 years of age did not develop the severe disease that was seen in adults (Baric et al., 2006, Deming et al., 2006, Ng et al., 2004). These data suggest that the quality of the immune response may play a role in the outcome of virus infection. The ability of vaccines to induce robust immune responses in senescent populations has been evaluated to determine if protection can be elicited in elderly populations with senescent immune systems. To evaluate vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous strains, the Urbani S glycoprotein and nucleocapsid genes were inserted in VEE virus replicon particles (VRP-S or VRP-N) (Baric et al., 2006, Deming et al., 2006). In addition, expression of the influenza A HA glycoprotein (VRP-HA) was used as a control. Using reverse genetics, synthetically resurrected recombinant viruses bearing the GD03 S glycoprotein that replicated to high titers in Vero and human airway epithelial cells have been obtained (Baric et al., 2006, Deming et al., 2006). Importantly, human convalescent sera had plaque reduction neutralization titre of 50% (PRNT50) values of about 1:1600 against late phase isolates like Urbani, yet were reduced about 10\u201315 fold against the heterologous icGD03 virus (PRNT50 1:150) (Fig. 3A). Young and senescent Balb/c mice with ages exceeding 1 year at the time of challenge, were vaccinated with VRP-HA, VRP-S, VRP-N, or a combination of VRP-S and VRP-N, and challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV expressing the Urbani S protein or the antigenically different GD03 S protein (Fig. 3B). In vaccinated animals, VRP-S vaccines provided complete short- and long-term protection against homologous challenge, protecting both young and senescent mice from the Urbani strain replication. After challenge, VRP-S and VRP-S + VRP-N vaccinated mice displayed little if any pathologic lesions in the lung, whereas VRP-HA vaccinated aged mice demonstrate pathological lesions in the lung similar to that reported in the literature (Roberts et al., 2005a). VRP-S vaccines also provided short-term protection in young mice challenged with the heterologous GD03 S strain, despite the significantly reduced ability of anti-Urbani S antibody to neutralize virus expressing GD03 S. In contrast, vaccination of senescent mice with VRP-S provided limited protection (\u223c38%) and the combination of VRP-S + VRP-N vaccines provided little long-term protection against infection by the antigenically different SARS-CoV GD03, although virus titers were reduced about 10-fold compared with VRP-HA controls. The SARS-CoV GD03 challenge also produced pathological lesions in both the VRP-HA and SARS-vaccinated animals that were virtually indistinguishable from those produced by infection with the SARS-CoV-Urbani strain. Therefore, it is likely that declining immunity of senescent animals in combination with the reduced ability of antibody to neutralize heterologous challenge viruses resulted in vaccine failure in aged animals. It seems that vaccine approaches that induce less robust neutralization responses like DNA and killed vaccines, might completely fail in protecting senescent populations against SARS-CoV GD03 challenge.",

It is also known that elderly respond poorly to new antigens as compared to younger populations, but overall this phenomena is poorly studied. Consequently, vaccine efficacy in the elderly is a key property of efficacious SARS-CoV vaccines. Immunosenescence is common in animal models and in clinical studies that occur during aging, and vaccine efficacy is often attenuated in the elderly (Frasca et al., 2005; Song et al., 1997; Zheng et al., 1997). Immune complications include a generalized decrease in the function of B and T cell and innate immune function, diminished macrophage and granulocyte function, diminished cellular traffic, cell growth and differentiation and decreased natural killer cell numbers and activity. New and different vaccine regimens should be developed and tested with the ultimate goal of eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of SARS-CoV, especially in the most vulnerable elderly populations, and that there is a need for further testing developing vaccines that induce an anti-N response in more animal models, similarly to what has been described in other viral systems (Frech et al., 2005, McElhaney, 2005).",

In contrast, no viral shedding occurred in the group immunized with the parainfluenza vector expressing the S protein. Recombinant viruses expressing SARS-CoV structural S, M, and N proteins, individually or in combination, have been evaluated for immunogenicity and protection in hamsters that support the replication of both SARS-CoV and parainfluenza vector (Buchholz et al., 2004). A single intranasal administration of the vector expressing the S glycoprotein induced a high titer of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, only two fold lower than that induced by SARS-CoV infection. This response provided complete protection against SARS-CoV challenge in the lower respiratory tract, and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, expression of M, N, or E proteins did not induce detectable serum SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies.",

Reports using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model have shown that deletion mutants removing ORFs 4, 5a, 7a, and HE are attenuating in the natural host (de Haan et al., 2002a). Similarly, studies deleting ORF 7 of TGEV (Ortego et al., 2003) and ORFs 3abc and 7ab of FIPV (Haijema et al., 2004) led to virus attenuation. However, SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, or 7b did not significantly influence in vitro and in vivo replication efficiency in the mouse model (Yount et al., 2005). All recombinant viruses replicated to wild-type levels in the murine model, suggesting that either the group-specific ORFs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for discerning the role of the group-specific ORFs in disease. In fact it has been surprising that ORFs like 3a, 7a, and 7b, that encode structural virus proteins, (Huang et al., 2006, Schaecher and Pekosz, 2006, Yount et al., 2005) have little influence on in vivo virus replication in the mouse model. Only deletion of ORF 3a has shown a minor decrease (about one log unit) in virus growth (Yount et al., 2005). Furthermore, deletion of more than one gene, such as deletion of ORFs 3a and 3b, and ORF6, showed a 1\u20131.5 log reduction in Vero cells but little effect on growth in the murine model at day 2 postinfection. Moreover, little difference in growth or pathogenesis were noted in the mice model between wt and deletion mutants lacking ORF3a and ORF7. Therefore, the effect of SARS-CoV gene deletions needs to be tested in more relevant animal models. Interestingly, the simultaneous deletion of larger combinations of group-specific genes such as 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b has lead to the production of an infectious SARS-CoV deletion-mutant that propagates in cell culture with a titer similar to that of the parental wild type virus. The potential of this deletion-mutant as a promising vaccine candidate is being studied (M.L. DeDiego, and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results).",

Electron microscopy observation of Vero E6 cells infected with the SARS-CoV wt or the \u0394E deletion mutant showed much higher assembly efficiency for the wt virus (Fig. 5\n).

An ideal animal model that completely reproduces human clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified. Nevertheless, the hamster model reproducibly supports SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or non-human primates. Virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis, and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus (Roberts et al., 2005b). Although overt clinical disease is absent, the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of SARS-CoV infection. Titers of recombinant SARS-CoV (rSARS-CoV) achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters (Fig. 6\n) were similar to those previously reported (Roberts et al., 2005b) and were 100\u20131000-fold higher than titers of the rSARS-CoV-\u0394E virus, suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated. Histopathology examination of lungs from infected hamsters was performed at two and five days post-infection, because it has been shown that pulmonary disease was most notable at these time points. Detection of viral antigen was reduced in lungs from rSARS-CoV-\u0394E infected hamsters and pulmonary inflammation was less prominent in these animals than in rSARS-CoV-infected animals, indicating that rSARS-CoV-\u0394E is attenuated in vivo (DeDiego et al., 2007). In fact, reduction of SARS-CoV titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and survival rates (Chu et al., 2004, Hung et al., 2004). In contrast, challenge of hamsters with recombinant viruses lacking single group specific ORFs3a and ORF7 did not result in significant reductions in virus titier or pathology (Baric et al., unpublished). Therefore, SARS-CoV-\u0394E attenuated virus is a promising vaccine candidate that is being evaluated in different animal models (mice, ferrets and macaques).",

SARS nsp1 blocks host macromolecular synthesis and abrogates IFN signaling (Kamitani et al., 2006), providing further evidence that nsp1 coding regions represent potential virulence determinants. Alternatively, Tyr6398His substitution in open reading frame (ORF) 1b-nsp14 has been demonstrated that attenuate MHV replication in mice (Sperry et al., 2005). Similarly, deletion of the nsp2 gene in MHV and SARS-CoV has been shown to yield viable attenuated mutant viruses that replicate about one log less efficiently than wt virus in cell culture and in animals, and may also provide a foundation for the design of live vaccines (Graham et al., 2005). As the nsp14 Tyr residue and nsp 2 are completely conserved, it may be possible to engineer common Coronaviridae attenuating alleles via recombinant DNA techniques. Alternatively, changes in gene order within the replicase or even relocation to the 3\u2032-end of the genome, if tolerated, may led to attenuated virus phenotypes.",

One of them is the construction of replication-competent, propagation-defective viruses (pseudovirions) that are defective in one gene conferring an attenuated phenotype or even the ability for virus propagation (Enjuanes et al., 2005). These viruses could be grown in packaging cell lines providing in trans the missing protein. In the case of SARS-CoV, vaccine candidates without the E gene have been constructed. In order to prevent the rescue of the virulent phenotype by recombination with a circulating human coronavirus, the deletion of an essential gene, located in a position distant from gene E, and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene E has been proposed. A potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene E would lead to the loss of the essential gene (Enjuanes, 2005).",

            "text": "An alternative approach for developing safer, recombination resistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by modifying the transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) of a vaccine strain to a sequence incompatible with the TRS of any known circulating coronavirus. The idea being that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and TRS remodeled SARS-CoV would result in genomes containing lethal mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mRNAs (Fig. 7A) (Yount et al., 2006). TRS sequences among coronaviruses are highly conserved and direct the expression of subgenomic mRNAs. Using a molecular clone, the SARS-CoV TRS network was remodeled from ACGAAC to CCGGAT (Fig. 7B). This rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows for efficient replication of the mutant virus, icSARS-CRG. The icSARS-CRG recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mRNAs and proteins. Interestingly, some new transcripts were noted initiating from the replicase gene, most of which could encode N-terminal truncated ORF1a polyproteins. It is not clear if these novel transcripts might influence pathogenic outcomes, although in some instances nsp3 is truncated potentially allowing for the establishment of dominant negative phenotypes on replication in cell culture and animals. An attractive SARS-CoV vaccine could further be modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic template of the recombination-resistant TRS rewired virus either for use as a safe, high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine. One interesting refinement of this approach would be to include secondary traps that are activated in recombinant genomes. In this instance, wt TRS sequences can be designed into intragenic sites in essential ORFs like the S and M glycoprotein genes. In recombinant viruses encoding wt leader TRS sequences, subgenomic transcription might initiate from within the essential structural genes and the resulting N-terminal deletions would likely be lethal or severely attenuating.",

This disease exacerbation was due to the virus-specific antibodies that facilitated and enhanced uptake and spread of the virus, causing ADE of infectivity (Porterfield, 1986, Vennema et al., 1990, Weiss and Scott, 1981), that is caused by spike protein specific antibodies (Corapi et al., 1995; Corapi et al., 1992; Olsen et al., 1993, Olsen et al., 1992).",

            "text": "With this scenario of side effects caused by some coronavirus vaccines, a safety concern is that SARS-CoV could induce similar antibody- or cell-mediated immune pathologies. This concern was increased mainly by three reports. One study utilizing lentivirus pseudotyped with various SARS-CoV S proteins (Yang et al., 2005) indicated that within the S protein, the major target for vaccine and immunotherapy, there are minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003, whereas substantial functional changes were detected in S derived from a case in late 2003 from Guandong province (isolate GD03) and from two palm civets (SZ16 and SZ3). The GD03 spike pseudotyped virus is markedly resistant to antibody neutralization. Alternatively, antibodies that neutralized most human S glycoproteins, enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat virus S glycoproteins related to the GD03 isolate (Yang et al., 2005). In another report, it has been shown that the administration into ferrets of MVA-based SARS-CoV S vaccine, but not MVA alone, followed by live SARS-CoV challenge, resulted in enhanced hepatitis (Weingartl et al., 2004). These side effects have not been reported in other studies with SARS-CoV in ferrets, in which it has been shown that ferrets are a useful model for SARS-CoV (Martina et al., 2003). Similarly, these data were not reproduced by other groups (He et al., 2006). Furthermore, ADE of disease has not been observed with any human SARS-CoV strain, therefore it will be important to assess vaccines in relevant animal models as they become available. Antibodies directed against SARS-CoV were found to be protective and not to enhance viral infectivity in the mouse or hamster models (Bisht et al., 2004, Roberts et al., 2005b; Subbarao et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004), using inactivated SARS-CoV or immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV (See et al., 2006), although their effect in humans remains unknown (Zhong et al., 2005). Side effects have not been observed in other animal models such as African green monkeys that, 2 months after administration of SARS-CoV into the respiratory tract, were challenged with SARS-CoV and no evidence of enhanced disease upon re-challenge was shown (McAuliffe et al., 2004).",

Temperature, breathing, appetite, mental state, and all biochemical indexes were normal for immunized monkeys, and no abnormalities were observed in major organs such as lung, liver, kidney, etc. All control non-vaccinated animals showed interstitial pneumonia. These results indicate that the purified SARS-CoV vaccine is safe in monkeys (Qin et al., 2006). In summary, immunization of mice using either S protein or whole inactivated virus (Spruth et al., 2006), or of monkeys with whole inactivated SARS-CoV (Qin et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2005), most frequently resulted in the absence of side effects after providing different types of SARS-CoV vaccines.",

            "text": "In contrast, VEE virus expressing N protein failed to induce protection in either young or senescent animals, and resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge between days 4 and 14 post-infection. Therefore, caution has to be taken before including N in vaccine formulations by expressing N protein using DNA immunization, or VEE vectors (Deming et al., 2006), as no protection was elicited in mice against homologous challenge, and no benefit to vaccination with a cocktail of both S and N proteins was observed. Rather, the co-expression of N protein in vaccine regimens which failed to simultaneously induce a strong neutralizing anti-S antibody response led to an increased number of lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates, which are also characteristic of the immune pathology observed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection following vaccination with formalin inactivated RSV (De Swart et al., 2002, Hancock et al., 1996). Therefore, the concern has been raised that expression of N protein may result in vaccine-enhanced pulmonary disease, as previously described for viruses like RSV (Kim et al., 1969). The data suggest that the presence of N protein in vaccines should be evaluated in each vaccine formulation (Deming et al., 2006). Although thus far, no human SARS-CoV S vaccine has been shown to be involved in ADE of disease, possible immunopathological complications of SARS vaccine candidates require rigorous clinical and immunological evaluation.",

An unrooted Bayesian phylogenetic gene tree of 24 SARS viruses divided into four groups. Group 1 includes viruses isolated from animals in southern China in 2003. Group 2 is a cluster of viruses isolated from animals and humans (*) in 2003. Group 3 includes viruses from all three phases of the human SARS epidemic of 2002\u20132003. Group 4 represents a cluster of viruses isolated from bats in 2005\u201306. A multiple sequence alignment of the spike gene of each virus was created using ClustalX 1.83 with default settings. Bayesian inference was conducted with Mr. Bayes, with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of four chains for 500,000 generations, and a consensus tree was generated using the 50% majority rule with a burn in of 1000. Branch confidence values are shown as posterior probabilities. The three human isolates that fall within the animal cluster (GZ0402, GD03, and GZ0401) may represent infections where a human acquired the virus from animals. The dashed line between Group 3 and Group 4 is used to represent a much longer line in the tree (\u223c10 times longer), thus the distance of the line is not representative of the distance between bat and human SARS.",
