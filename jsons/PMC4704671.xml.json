Neutralization by mAb m102.4 was only affected by its respective escape mutations at V507I (NiV-M) and D582N (HeV; Figures 2A and 3A) and not by mutations generated by other mAbs. Neutralization by mAb nAH1.3 was affected by its respective NiV-M escape mutant at position Q450K but also by the mutations at N159D and R516K (Figure 2B), originally generated by mAb hAH5.1. Interestingly, the mutation at N159D in combination with a Q388R change did not affect neutralization, further suggesting that the N159D mutation is not involved in escape from neutralization. In addition, while mAb nAH1.3 was generated against NiV G, this antibody also potently neutralized HeV. Several mutations in HeV G were associated with a decrease in neutralization by mAb nAH1.3, including mutations at positions S134F, H406Y, and D582N (Figure 3B). For mAb 213, neutralization was not only affected by the virus strain (Figure 1C) but also by its respective escape mutations N159D and Q388R (Figure 2C). Again, the N159D mutation in combination with an R516K change did not result in loss of neutralization. Finally, neutralization by hAH1.3 was affected by 3 mutations in HeV G, at positions S134F, H406Y, and D582N, similar to nAH1.3 (Figure 3C).\n",

The mutation at residue H406Y, associated with escape from neutralization by mAb nAH.3, is located near one of the 4 binding pockets that interact with residue W122 of ephrin B2 [17] and includes V401 and N402 on HeV G (Figure 4A). The mutation at D582N is next to residue Y581, which is part of the binding pocket for the ephrin B2 residue F117 (Figure 4A) [17]. The close proximities of these escape mutations to binding pockets suggest that the mAbs m102.4 and nAH1.3 and hAH1.3 all neutralize HeV by interfering with receptor binding.\n",

This is not surprising, since the mAbs used in this study all targeted the HNV G. Two neutralization-escape mutants had 2 amino acid changes in NiV-M. They shared a mutation at residue N159, but this mutation was unlikely to play a role in neutralization escape, since each escape mutant was only refractory to neutralization by its respective mAb. This suggests that the unique changes at R516K or Q388R and not the common residue at N159D play a role in neutralization escape from mAbs 213 and nAH1.3. The function of the N159D change in association with neutralization escape remains unknown, but it is possible that this is a compensatory change. Position 159 is between 2 critical cysteines, C158 and C162, of the NiV G stalk region that mediate covalent subunit dimerization [21].

The V507I and D582N mutations in NiV-M and HeV respectively have previously been shown to disrupt m102.4 binding while maintaining high affinity for ephrin B2 and B3. The crystal structure of m102.3 (m102.4 derivative) bound to the HeV G shows that m102.3 resembles the G-H loop of ephrin B2 in both its shape and insertion angle into the HeV G binding pocket [12]. The HeV escape mutant H406Y is adjacent to another binding pocket on the HeV G that is responsible for interacting with the ephrin B2 residue W122 [17]. Finally, the Q388R mutation affects the hydrogen bond between Q388 and D108 on NiV-M G and ephrin B2, respectively [18], which imparts affinity and stabilizes the receptor-bound complex [22]. This hydrogen bond is involved in an area that contains salt bridges and other hydrogen bonds. The Q388R mutation is close to the T385A and K386E found on the NiV-B strain, which could explain why the NiV-B strain is not efficiently neutralized by mAb 213. Interestingly, this epitope is also missing in a recently described HNV isolated from a Ghanaian bat, suggesting that this virus would not be susceptible to neutralization by mAb 213 [22, 23].",

Several neutralization-escape mutations in the receptor-binding domain of SARS coronavirus resulted in reduced replication in a variety of cells and reduced virulence in mice [25]. In the current study, several amino acids associated with neutralization escape were previously shown to be directly involved in binding to the receptor ephrin B2. In a more recent study, we have shown that mutations at V507 and D582 on the NiV-M and HeV G, respectively, did not result in significant differences in replication in vitro [12]. Here we expanded this finding by testing the in vitro replication of 5 other neutralization-escape mutants. Although at least 2 of these mutations were located within the receptor-binding domain, no changes in propagation were detected, but a change at R516K resulted in a lower titer at 18 hours after infection, suggesting that entry may have been affected by this mutation. While virus replication was not affected in cell culture, significant attenuation was observed for some mutants in the hamster model. Several neutralization-escape mutations in NiV-M G resulted in a significant delay in time to death (4\u20136 days). In addition, a reduction in virus titers was observed in lung and brain tissues, considered key target organs for HNV infection in hamsters [16].",
