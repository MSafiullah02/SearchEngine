ErbB4, which has not been studied in depth, is not an oncogene and has a protective role in some cancers. To elucidate the role of ErbB4, MacBeath and co\u2010workers first identified tyrosine phosphorylation sites on ErbB4 by using a tandem mass spectrometry approach. Subsequently, a microarray displaying 96 SH2 and 37 PTB domains (the microarray was created from aldehyde\u2010modified glass slides) was probed with fluorescently labeled phosphopeptides representing the identified ErbB4 phosphorylation sites. This approach enabled the construction of a quantitative interaction network for ErbB4. New interactions between ErbB4 and the DNA\u2010binding protein STAT1, which is believed to play a role in apoptosis, were identified (Figure 1). The authors attributed the protective role of ErbB4 in cancer to its ability to form benign heterodimers with the other ErbB receptors, thus decreasing the amount of oncogenic heterodimers of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 through a \u201cbuffering mechanism\u201d.9\n",

They were interested in identifying neuronal adaptations possibly associated with abuse of methamphetamine in humans.40 Abuse of methamphetamine is known to cause aggressive behavior in humans and in a variety of animals, such as cats, rodents, and nonhuman primates. In comparison to a control group, they found increased aggressiveness and locomotion in mice treated chronically with methamphetamine for several weeks. Protein\u2010expression levels were compared by using a commercially available antibody array displaying 378 monoclonal antibodies, including antibodies related to signal transduction and neurobiology. Brain tissue was removed from the mice, and proteins were extracted and labeled with fluorescent dyes before their incubation on the antibody array. Data evaluation showed a downregulation of seven proteins and an upregulation of one protein. Among these proteins were Erk2, a principal component of the mitogen\u2010activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, and 14\u20103\u20103e, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Together with a follow\u2010up kinase screen, these results hinted at involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the behavioral change, as has also been observed in other animal models. Although further studies are required, the results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the microarray\u2010based approach.",
