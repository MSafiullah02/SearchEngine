Meanwhile, PCR assays were performed frequently after the index case and all family members became PCR positive between the period Jan 28 th and Feb 2 nd . Importantly, FB1 had been sick for 8 days before she was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.",

In this family cluster, PCR results all became positive much later than the initial onset of disease symptoms, and FC2 was tested PCR negative on Feb 7 th and discharged from hospital before it became positive again on Mar 5 th . Furthermore, all family members had CT scans, but only the adults showed abnormalities. All families except Family B had an index case who was exposed in Wuhan. The index of Family B (FB1) didn't have direct exposure in Wuhan, but had a meeting with an individual who had come from Wuhan to Beijing. The index cases in the other three families were regarded as the 1 st generation contact with the disease, while the other family members were regarded as the 2 nd generation cases.

All the children with positive PCR results became negative after 5-17 days. For the adults, the PCR remained positive much longer, some for over 28 days. In addition, we have shown that viral shedding can precede the onset of symptoms, which may contribute to the spread of this virus. Another interesting observation is that there seemed to be differences in the onset and duration viral shedding between family clusters, suggesting the possible differences in virulence of the viruses, which merits further investigation with the inclusion of the virus genome data.",

The child was released on Feb 14 th , but returned again to hospital on Mar 4 th because of the PCR test became positive again, although no clinical symptom was observed.",

The virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract usually followed the onset of symptoms, but in some of the cases it preceded any symptoms(Figure 1).
