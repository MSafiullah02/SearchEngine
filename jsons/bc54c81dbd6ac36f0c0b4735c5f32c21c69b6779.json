Ninety-one (50.0%) received the influenza vaccine and 91 (50.0%) were not vaccinated. In each group, 46 children had been off therapy for less than 6 months and 45 for 6-24 months. The group of healthy unvaccinated children included 91 subjects. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the study population. There was no statistically significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated oncohematological patients. However, full-time day-care or school attendance was significantly less frequent among the children who had been off therapy for less than 6 months than among those who had been off therapy for longer, and they also had a significantly higher number of respiratory infection, antibiotic courses and hospitalisations in the year before enrolment. The healthy children were comparable with those of the two cancer subgroups in terms of gender, mean age, mean number of household members, the frequency of exposure to passive smoking, and urban residence. However, their full-time day-care or school attendance, respiratory infections in the previous year, antibiotic courses, and hospitalisations were more similar to the cancer patients who had been off therapy for more than 6 months. Influenza vaccination among households was significantly more frequent among the oncohematological patients regardless of their own influenza vaccination status or length of time off therapy than among the healthy controls. Table 2 summarises the impact of influenza-like illness on the oncohematological children not vaccinated against influenza. Those who had been off therapy for less than 6 months suffered from a statistically significant greater number of URTIs and LRTIs, infections other than influenza-like illness, hospitalisations, and days of fever, required antibiotics significantly more often, and lost more school days than those who had been off therapy for more than 6 months or the healthy children. On the contrary, the mean number of URTIs, LRTIs, infections other than influenza-like illness, and days of fever were similar in the unvaccinated oncohematological children who had been off therapy for more than six and in the healthy subjects during the study period. However, also these patients had a significantly higher mean number of hospitalisations, received a higher mean number of antibiotic courses, and lost a significantly greater number of school days than the healthy controls. Table 3 shows that the household contacts of the unvaccinated cancer children who had been off therapy for less than 6 months had influenza-like illnesses, required medical visits, received antibiotic courses, and lost working days (parents) or school days (siblings) significantly more often than those of the unvaccinated cancer children who had been off therapy for longer or the healthy children. Except for the number of working days lost by mothers, the rates of all of the other variables were similar among the household contacts of the children with cancer who had been off therapy for more than 6 months and the healthy controls. Table 4 shows that influenza vaccination was effective in reducing influenza-related morbidity among all of the vaccinated children, regardless of the time since their last cancer therapy. This table represented numbers observed in oncohematologic patients vaccinated against influenza off therapy for <6 months or off therapy for 6-24 months, and vaccine effectiveness was calculated comparing these numbers with those reported in Table 2 regarding oncohematological patients not vaccinated against influenza. One of the major benefits in both groups was the reduction in the number of hospitalisations, but the effectiveness of vaccination in decreasing the number of URTIs and LRTIs, days of fever, antibiotic courses, and lost school days was greater in the children who had been off therapy for less than 6 months. Table 5 shows that influenza vaccination also reduced the clinical and socioeconomic costs of influenza-like illness in the households of the vaccinated oncohematological children, with better results once again being observed among the households of children who had been off therapy for less than 6 months in terms of the number of influenza-like illnesses, medical visits, hospitalisations, working days lost by parents, and school days lost by siblings. In this table, numbers represented what has been observed in households of oncohematological patients vaccinated against influenza off therapy for <6 months or off therapy for 6-24 months, and vaccine effectiveness was calculated comparing these numbers with those reported in Table 3 regarding households of oncohematological patients not vaccinated against influenza. Table 6 shows the adverse events (AEs) observed in the influenza vaccinated children. The safety and tolerability of the vaccine was excellent after both doses (41 children received a second dose). Only a minority of children experienced AEs regardless of the time since the completion of cancer therapy or vaccine dose, and none of the AEs were serious; most of them were mild and did not require treatment. Fever was observed in only a few cases, with only two children who had been off therapy for less than 6 months (one after the first dose and one after the second), and one child who had been off therapy for more than 6 months (after the second dose) having a temperature of more than 39 \u2022 C.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 366, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1564, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2553, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 3186, "end": 3193, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3625, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4006, "end": 4013, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 4741, "end": 4748, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 4834, "end": 4841, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The results of this study show that the clinical and socioeconomic impact of influenza-like illness, and the effectiveness of influenza vaccination among children with ALL, HD or NHL who have completed cancer therapy, are related to the length of the off therapy period and seem to be significantly greater among those who have been off therapy for less than 6 months.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "After an off therapy period of more than 6 months, the rates of clinical and socioeconomic problems caused by influenza-like illnesses do not seem to be significantly different from those observed in healthy subjects.
