This framework has been highly influential (Rawat and Morris 2016, 608\u2013638) and has been described by John (1998, 173) as closest to \u201can adequate theory of public policy.\u201d Kingdon developed the framework to explain policymaking in the United States; but it has been applied to the policymaking machinery in many countries, including Canada\n(Henstra 2010), and international comparative policymaking research (B\u00e9land and Howlett 2016).",

Various actors\u2019 preferences are often problematic because they are unclear, ambivalent, fluid and sometimes even contradictory. Preferences may shift as circumstances change. Fluid participation relates to changes in both the decision-making body and variations in the levels of interest and involvement of various decision makers and decision support actors. Unclear technology relates to the processes whereby the government department or agency converts resource inputs into policy and program outputs. Decision makers may be unaware of or organizational norms may not clearly specify which officials are responsible to process various decisions and to enact the various activities of the implementation process.",

Problems come to attention through interpretation of indicators of various outcomes collected by governments or non-government policy organizations, focusing events and feedback related to program operations and outputs. Indicators may be the result of regular monitoring or special studies, and if a change (or sometimes, persistence) in indicators is constructed as problematic according to belief and value criteria, the referent condition may be constructed as a public policy problem.",

Limitations of social assistance identified include inadequate benefits (Tweddle and Aldridge 2019), narrow eligibility criteria based on reason for need rather than fact of need, high levels of conditionality related to employment seeking and expenditure, high tax back rates on earned income, and stigmatization (Calnitsky 2016), which impairs social integration.

In addition, 52% of respondents thought that financing a basic income would increase taxation to unaffordable levels. A more recent web-based survey (Reinhart, 2019) of 3,049 respondents conducted in May and June 2019 asked a question based on a narrower conception of the purpose of basic income. This question was \u201cDo you support or not support a universal basic income as a way to help people in Canada who lose their jobs because of advances in artificial intelligence?\u201d Seventy-five percent indicated support, with support stronger among women (77%) than among men (72%). Support was also negatively associated with age and educational attainment. However, only 49% of respondents would be willing to pay higher taxes to fund such a basic income program. Given the differences in questions between the two surveys, it is difficult to determine if support among Canadians for basic income grew substantially over the two-year interval between them. It is, however, a significant concern about high taxation makes it clear that Canadian governments do not seem to be facing strong public pressure to implement a basic income.",

Thus, the strategy established an official poverty measure, set targets and timelines, committed to poverty reduction legislation and established an advisory committee. It did not, however, include any policies, programs or expenditure commitments to reach the targets (Robson 2018). Therefore, there was no opportunity for a policy window to open because the poverty reduction strategy avoided a policy agenda. The emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic, and specifically the need for stimulus to support aggregate demand and income replacement for households which have lost employment and self-employment earnings, may have opened another policy window for basic income as a broader consensus than usual has emerged in support of it as a solution to the economic effects of the pandemic (Toronto Star\n2020). In this context, policy entrepreneurs and members of policy communities have advocated for basic income in the media (Frankel 2020; Forget and Segal 2020), but sometimes only as a temporary measure during the pandemic and recovery (Boessenkool 2020). Fifty Canadian senators, almost half of the chamber, have written to the prime minister calling for a basic income (Eggleton and Segal 2020), but the prime minister has rejected basic income in favor of targetted policies which help those who need it most (Wright 2020). In addition, he disputes the views that basic income is less complex than targetted approaches, and that it can deliver benefits more quickly. However, pressure continues to mount to implement a basic income.",

Given his prominence, and the fact that he was appointed to the Senate by Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin and was appointed by Ontario Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne to prepare a discussion paper on Ontario\u2019s basic income pilot ( Segal 2016), Segal likely has access to Liberal policymakers. He also has expended extensive reputational resources and displayed persistent energy in advocating for basic income. Beyond this, he has extensive connections to academic specialists because he has held positions with several Canadian universities.",

The first is that advocates must remain highly vigilant for the opportunities presented by the opening of a policy window. According to the framework, a window may open unexpectedly due to changes in the political stream or a problem available for coupling entering the decision agenda. Once open advocates must respond quickly because the window may close because of changes in political circumstances or alternatives other than basic income being successfully coupled with the available problem. This implies that basic income policy communities and networks must be well organized and sufficiently resourced to take swift action.",

            "text": "Second, policy advocates must make difficult strategic choices in terms of how many and with which problematic conditions to couple basic income, especially in the period before policy windows are open. There are four main considerations, and they may imply contradictory actions. One is that basic income must be linked to problems for which the logic of basic income as a solution can be easily articulated and demonstrated. Ideally, some empirical and/or logical evidence for a causal connection should be available. Second, in terms of increasing public support, it may be useful to link basic income to as many problems as possible so that many segments of the public have a stake in placing basic income on the government agenda. Third, in order to facilitate the organization of well-integrated policy communities and networks of specialists, it may be best to couple basic income with fewer problems and to select those problems that are relevant to the same or closely related academic specialties. Finally, in terms of targeting decision makers for advocacy, it may be useful to select fewer problems for coupling and to choose those managed by the same government department or agency. This will avoid both rivalry between units and lack of clarity about which unit is responsible. Advocates must balance these considerations based on which seems most crucial at a particular point in time.",

This is especially necessary because opposing specialists often present unrealistically high estimates (Pereira 2017). The estimates prepared by basic income advocates should derive net costs after subtracting savings in other income support programs because of implementation of a basic income and decreases in health care, social service and criminal justice costs related to reductions in poverty (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019). In order to meet the feasibility criterion, sources of financing should be identified. Beyond this, costs should be linked to outcomes in order to frame the financial commitment as an investment rather than a cost.",

The focus of the experiment was to assess the labor supply effect of a basic income using a controlled randomized experimental design involving 1300 families from Winnipeg and rural Manitoba (Simpson et al. 2017). The design of the experiment involved random assignment to eight conditions based on three variations in guarantee level and three variations in tax rate or a control group. A tenth variation involving the highest guarantee level and lowest tax rate was deemed too expensive to implement. In addition, a saturation site was developed in the Town of Dauphin and the surrounding rural area, where enrollment in a single scheme was available to all who were eligible based on an income test. It was meant to study the effects of basic income in a context similar to full implementation, including community-wide and labor market effects. These data have also been used by Forget (2011), in a quasi-experimental design to assess the health and educational effects of a basic income.",

Using the Dauphin saturation site, Forget (2011) used a combination of hard matching and propensity score matching to develop a comparison group composed of three individuals for every Dauphin subject. Her statistically controlled analysis demonstrated an 8.5% decrease in hospitalization rates, and especially those related to accidents, injuries, and mental health diagnoses during the Mincome period. She also found a decrease in physician claims related to mental health diagnoses. In addition, Forget used aggregate education data to study the likelihood of the movement of tenth grade students to grade eleven and of eleventh grade students to grade twelve. She compared Dauphin with other rural jurisdictions and with urban jurisdictions.

This may be a hard risk to prevent completely, because an experiment is much easier to cancel than an established program. However, some actions might be taken to mitigate this risk, at least partially (Mulvale and Frankel 2019). One is to attempt to remove the experiment as much as possible from a narrow partisan framing. This could involve advocates in consulting with all political parties when designing experiments to propose in order to try to incorporate features and research questions of interest to each party. The hope is to insulate the proposal against political change by building a stake in it for each party. Another ameliorative action could involve softening the environment for introduction of a basic income experiment early in a government\u2019s mandate so that it is completed or almost completed before the next election.

Mendelson (2019) points out that these are inherent in basic income experiments in which participants may be responding to the short-term nature of the program differently than they would to a permanent program, and Simpson et al. (2017) point out that the direction of the differences may be unpredictable. In addition, participants may be responding to the experimental measurement arrangements, to frequent monitoring or to the contrast between their experience and that of non-participants in their neighborhoods or networks, rather than to the basic income intervention. Some of these effects might be reduced through using administrative data supplemented by survey or interview data (Simpson et al. 2017). Including various lengths of the guarantee period in experiments may help to estimate the effects of the short-term nature of experiments. However, the threats to construct validity can never be eliminated completely.",

These threats render the experimental sample as unrepresentative of the relevant population that would be served by a basic income.

For example, it would be useful for advocates to know if basic income enhances norms of social solidarity and trust as some suggest (Standing 2008). This may decrease community violence and increase social support, which might constitute good evidence for advocacy. However, saturation sites can also produce findings that are difficult for basic income advocates to manage, and they must arm themselves with strategies to deal with this. For example, Calnitsky and Latner (2017) found, in a comparative analysis of Dauphin saturation participants and a rural dispersed sample, that Dauphin participants experienced a 3.2% decline in labor market participation due to a community context effect that was beyond what dispersed participants experienced.",
