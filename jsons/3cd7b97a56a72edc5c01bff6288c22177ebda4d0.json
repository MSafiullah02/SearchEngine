            "text": "respiratory, digestive, neurological, and immune-mediated diseases in human and animals. The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was caused by SARS-CoV, which is most closely related to group II CoV, especially the bovine CoV (BCoV). Although the exact origin of SARS-CoV remains to be identified, the fact that similar SARS-CoV has been repeatedly isolated in wild animals, including civet cat, raccoon dog, and badges, strongly suggests that SARS-CoV originates from animals. It was postulated that SARS-CoV is a zoonotic pathogen. 1 Ironically, the zoonotic nature of CoV had been documented long before the outbreak of SARS. In 1994, Zhang et al., 2 reported the isolation of a human enteric CoV (HECoV) from a 6-year old child with partial sequence of the structural genes revealed that HECoV is more closely related to BCoV than to other members of the CoV family. Interestingly, several studies showed that BCoV was able to infect other small ruminants, turkey, and dogs and cause clinical diseases in these animals, thus further supporting the idea that BCoV is a zoonotic pathogen. Therefore, BCoV is the first documented CoV that can cross species barrier and infect animals ranging from avian, ruminant, carnivore, to humans. In the present study, we attempted to develop an infectious cDNA clone of HECoV by reverse genetics, which will provide a powerful genetic tool for future studies of the molecular evolution and animal to human transmission, and the molecular pathogenesis, and for the design of preventive and therapeutic interventions.",

In some instances, multiple independent RT-PCR products for the same fragments were sequenced. Thus, although quasispecies may exist in the viral populations, the sequence so determined must represent the vast majority of the viral genome in the RNA pools. Analysis of the sequence data revealed that the entire HECoV genome consists of 31,029-nt plus the poly(A) tail. The genome organization is similar to those of other CoV, with the ORFs in the order of 1a-1b-32kDa-HE-S-ORF5-6-7-E-M-N. The 5'-end of the genome is capped as inferred from the result with RLM-RACE and the penultimate nt is guanine. There is a 70-nt leader at the 5'-end, and a core consensus UCUAAAC at the 3'-end of the leader and the intergenic region proceeding each gene. Sequence comparison with other human CoV such as HCoV-229E, 3 HCoV-OC43, 4 SARS-CoV, 5 and a most recent isolate HCoV-NL63 6 and animal CoV revealed that HECoV-4408 is most closely related to BCoV 7 with a nt identity of 98%, whereas the nt identity with HCoV-OC43 is 95%. Overall, the homology with other three human CoV was less than 60%. The fact that HECoV is more closely related the animal BCoV than to other human CoV suggests that HECoV is likely derived from BCoV. This conclusion is consistent with the previous finding obtained from comparative studies on the biologic and antigenic relatedness among HECoV, HCoV-OC43 and BCoV. 2 ",

            "text": "To assemble a full-length HECoV cDNA, 9 fragments spanning the HECoV genome was cloned and sequenced. Each cDNA in the plasmids was released by digestion with 2 class II enzymes BsmB I and Bsa I as described, 8 generating a unique 4-nt overhang at both ends of each fragment. Consequently, only the two neighboring fragments can join together. Thus, a unidirectional assembly of a full-length cDNA was achieved by ligation of the 9 fragments in vitro. RNAs were then transcribed from the cDNAs in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. Transcription of full-length RNAs was verified by RT-PCR with primers specific to the 3'-end of the viral genome (data not shown). To determine whether the in vitro transcribed, full-length RNA is infectious, we transfected the RNAs together with N gene transcripts into BHK cells by electroporation and co-cultured the BHK cells with HRT-18 cells for 3 days. Medium from the coculture was blindly passaged for several times in fresh HRT-18 cells. At 72 h p.i., intracellular RNA was isolated from HRT-18 cells and the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic mRNAs were determined by RT-PCR using primers specific to genomic fragment A or to the 5'end of N mRNA. Indeed, both fragments were amplified. Fragment A was digested with XhoI. Because an Xho I site was engineered specifically into fragment A, this indicates that the RNAs present in HRT-18 cells are derived from transfected RNA. In contrast, although a similar fragment A was amplified from HECoV-infected HRT-18 cells (which used as a positive control), it could not be digested with XhoI (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the full-length HECoV cDNA clone is infectious in HRT-18 cells. The generation of a full-length HECoV infectious cDNA clone will provide a powerful approach for genetic manipulation of the HECoV genome, for studying viral pathogenesis, and for developing potential vaccines.",
