            "text": "The spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is important for vaccine development. S TR2 (an 88 kDa truncated SARS-CoV TW1 S protein carrying the S fragments S-74-253, S-294-739, and S-1129-1255) is capable of expressing a major form of glycoprotein as endo H-sensitive ($115 kDa) in CHO cells. To establish stable expressing cell clones, we transfected CHO/dhFr-cells with the amplifiable vectors ISID (IRES-driven dhfr) and ISIZ (SV40-driven dhfr) to select stepwise MTX, and observed enhanced $115 kDa glycoform generation through gene amplification. Following stepwise MTX selection, we compared gene amplification levels between two vectors in engineered CHO cell chromosomes. These results confirm that the IRES-driven dhfr promoter generates greater gene amplification, which in turn enhances S TR2 expression. Our results indicate that the $115 kDa glycoform of S TR2 protein was capable of increasing after gene amplification. The S TR2 glycoform did not change between suspension and serum-free cultures, suggesting that the stable and amplified cell clones analyzed in this study have potential for producing homologous S TR2 on a large scale.",

            "text": "The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome contains 5 0capped and 3 0 -polyadenylated positive-stranded RNA consisting of 29,740 bases that encode four structural proteins: (i) an envelope spike protein S [1,255 amino acid (aa)] that mediates receptor binding and virus fusion, (ii) a small E protein (76 aa) that assists with virus assembly, (iii) a nucleocapsid protein N (422 aa) that binds with and protects the virus RNA genome from damage, and (iv) a matrix protein M (221 aa) that interacts with S, N, and E and combines them to form a complete and infectious virus particle. [1] [2] [3] The S protein of SARS-CoV is a major antigen that elicits neutralizing antibody response in hosts. 4, 5 The S protein contains 1,255 aa, including (i) a signal peptide (SP) (1-12 aa) located at the N terminus, (ii) an extracellular domain 195 aa), (iii) a transmembrane domain (TM) (1, 215 aa), and (iv) a cytoplasmic domain (CP). 6 The S protein can be cleaved into two subunits: a S1 subunit containing a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a S2 subunit that mediates the fusion process via a fusion peptide (FP) with two helix regions (HR1 and HR2). Three domains (I, II, and III) have been mapped to elicit neutralizing antibodies where domain I (130-150 aa) is located in the N terminus of the S1 subunit; however, specifics of the neutralization mechanism remain unknown. 7 Domain II contains the 318-510 aa RBD, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies. 7, 8 Domain III includes the 1,143-1,192 aa HR2, which can be neutralized by disturbing HR1-HR2 interaction. 9 The receptor-binding domain of the S protein is a primary target for subunit vaccine development. 8, [10] [11] [12] According to one report, RBD protein expression in mammalian cells elicits a more potent neutralizing antibody response than RBD protein expression in Escherichia coli or insect cells. 10 In addition, glycosylation residues adjacent to the RBD protein have been shown to affect neutralizing antibody titers. 11 S protein RBD is considered a key function domain for receptor binding and contains neutralizing epitopes, 13 including one at the N terminus of the S protein and the other near HR2. 14 Residues 1,143-1,157 in HR2 have been identified as a 15-residue epitope that is recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. 9 Intranasal or intramuscular inoculation with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing fulllength S proteins into BALB/c mice neutralizes antibody production and elicits protective immunity. Post-MVA-S immunization, BALB/c mice show reduced SARS-CoV virus titer in their upper and lower respiratory tracts following challenges with the virus. 15 According to another report, a recombinant attenuated parainfluenza Type 3 vector expressing S instead of E, M, and N proteins induces neutralizing antibodies and provides protective immunity against SARS-CoV, 16 suggesting that S protein is the only protective antigen among all SARS-CoV structure proteins. In a third study, researchers intramuscularly injected a DNA vaccine containing codon-optimized truncated S protein (1-1,242) into BALB/c mice. They observed a strong T-cell response (CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells against S protein), neutralized antibody production, and a greater than 10 6 reduction in virus replication in the lungs of vaccinated mice in response to SARS-CoV challenges. 17 The SARS-CoV S protein is considered a primary target for subunit vaccine development. 6 Recent investigations using S proteins as vaccine candidates are listed in Table 1 . A recombinant baculovirus-expressed S protein containing only the ecto-domain or a His-tagged full-length version has been found to elicit high titers of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice. 4 S protein antigenicity is characterized by 38 monoclonal antibodies and three neutralizing epitopes (12-327 aa, 318-510 aa, and 528-635 aa). 5 A truncated S protein (248-680 aa) fused with an N protein fragment (321-422 aa) has been shown to provide post-challenge protection from virus replication in mice. 19 With the exception of the full-length S protein, the RBD region is the major target for developing protein subunit vaccines. Fusion proteins containing RBD and human IgG1 Fc can induce highly neutralizing antibody response. 8 When compared with recombinant RBD expressed in 293T cells, Sf9 cells, and E. coli, rRBD expressed in 293T cells is capable of eliciting stronger immune responses. 10 Furthermore, rRBD deglycosylated by PNGase F shows a lower neutralizing antibody response. 11 According to these findings, rRBD expressed in mammalian cells is (i) capable of correct folding and glycosylation and (ii) more antigenic. CHO cells have therefore been used to establish cell lines that stably express rRBD. 12 We previously reported that a truncated form of the S protein (S TR2 ) containing S fragments S74-253, S294-739, and S1129-1255 can be transiently expressed in CHO cells by using a 138 bp intron of pIRES (a bidirectional exon splicing enhancer) and a fibronectin EDA exon enhancer ( Figure 1 ). The intron addition significantly enhanced S TR2 protein expression. 20 S TR2 protein contains RBD and two other neutralizing epitopes, suggesting that it is capable of inducing more neutralizing antibodies than the rRBD antigen alone. 21 In this study, we obtained stable CHO cell clones using dhfr-directed gene amplification, because the weaker dhfr gene promoter generally results in more copies following MTX selection. 22 Accordingly, for gene amplification, we constructed two expression vectors, one containing the IRES-driven dhfr gene (ISID) and one containing the SV40driven dhfr gene (ISIZ). We selected clones that expressed high-level S TR2 and analyzed differences in gene amplification and amplified gene stability between the two vectors, thereby generating stable CHO cell clones for subunit vaccine development against SARS-CoV.",

Single cell cloning from a total of 48 stable clones was conducted and examined for the S TR2 expression by western blotting. Sixteen clones showing high-S TR2 expression from ISID-transfected cells and another sixteen clones from ISIZ-transfected cells were selected for dhfr-mediated gene amplification. These clones were passaged into six-well plates for MTX selection. MTX was a folate antagonist to inhibit DHFR protein. MTX concentration was gradually increased from 0.02-0.08 to 0.32-1.0 lM. To adapt the increasing concentration of MTX, the dhfr gene in the transfected cells would be amplified accompanying S TR2 gene amplification. The gene amplification process is shown in Figure 4 . Stable clone selection at each MTX concentration required 2-3 weeks of effort, with recovery time generally ranging from 1.5 to 3 weeks, though longer in some cases. Cells required more time to recover at higher MTX concentrations; ISID cell clones needed more recovery time than ISIZ cell clones. Five ISIZ-transfected clones and three ISID-transfected clones survived following treatment with 1.0 lM MTX. Surviving cell clones at each MTX concentration were collected (in the same quantities as cells collected during MTX selection) and analyzed by western blotting for S TR2 expression.

CD CHO Medium is a chemically defined medium that contains no proteins, hydrolysates. EX-CELL V R CHO DHFR \u00c0 medium is an animal component-free medium that contains recombinant human insulin, plant hydrolysates, and other organic compounds. The definition of robust cell growth was based on single passage assay. After adaption of the cells to serum-free media, the same amount of cells were seeded and maintained in each medium. After 3-day serumfree cultures, the amount of the cells was calculated to show better growth using EX-CELL V R CHO DHFR \u00c0 medium compared with CD CHO medium (data not shown).

After MTX selection, the numbers of dhfr copies of both ISID and ISIZ clones increased at various levels, depending on the individual clone. With the exception of ISIZ clone 51, numbers of dhfr copies of ISID clones were generally greater than of ISIZ clones, and S TR2 expression in ISID clones was stronger than in ISIZ clones. The exception of ISIZ clone 51 may be due to the random integration into the genome at transcriptionally less active sites. These results confirm that the weaker dhfr gene promoter generates greater gene amplification, which in turn enhances S TR2 expression. According to one recent report, a weaker promoter driving dhfr gene expression can increase amplification range. 22 Another research team used a weak herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) promoter to construct a dhframplifiable vector, 24 and a third used a novel approach using RNA interference to suppress dhfr gene expression. 18 It is possible to enhance gene amplification by combining RNAi and weak promoters, but doing so makes the process more difficult and requires even more time to establish stable and amplified cell clones.",

During the stable clone selection and gene amplification processes described in this report, S TR2 had variable glycoforms, molecular weights ranging from 88 to 115 kDa, and a 115 kDa (as opposed to 130 kDa) amplified form ( Figure 5 ). During our experiment, we observed that the S TR2 glycoform depended on cell density in terms of adhesion culture. The molecular weight of S TR2 may be smaller than 115 kDa when cell confluence reaches 100%. Too high-cell density would result in increased ammonia in the medium, which comes from cellular metabolism or chemical decomposition of glutamine. It was reported that increased concentration of ammonia in the medium could increase heterogeneity of glycoproteins produced by CHO cells. [25] [26] [27] Our results indicate that unlike the $130 kDa glycoform, the $115 kDa glycoform was capable of increasing after gene amplification ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, we assumed that the CHO cell clones preferred $115 kDa glycoform production.
