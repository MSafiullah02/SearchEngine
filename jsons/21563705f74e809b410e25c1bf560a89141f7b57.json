            "text": "Vaccines for the swine flu pandemic of 2009 have been produced in an exquisitely short time frame. This speed of production comes because of 50 years of hard work by virologists worldwide in pharma groups, research laboratories, and government licensing units. The present chapter presents the background framework of influenza vaccine production and its evolution over 50 years. Isolation of the causative virus of influenza in 1933, followed by the discovery of embryonated hen eggs as a substrate, quickly led to the formulation of vaccines. Virus-containing allantoic fluid was inactivated with formalin. The phenomenon of antigenic drift of the virus HA was soon recognized and as WHO began to coordinate the world influenza surveillance, it became easier for manufacturers to select an up-to-date virus. Influenza vaccines remain unique in that the virus strain composition is reviewed yearly, but modern attempts are being made to free manufacturers from this yolk by investigating internal virus proteins including M2e and NP as \"universal\" vaccines covering all virus subtypes. Recent technical innovations have been the use of Vero and MDCK cells as the virus cell substrate, the testing of two new adjuvants, and the exploration of new presentations to the nose or epidermal layers as DNA or antigen mixtures. The international investment into public health measures for a global human outbreak of avian H5N1 influenza together with a focus of swine influenza H1N1 is leading to enhanced production of conventional vaccine and to a new research searchlight on T-cell epitope vaccines, viral liveattenuated carriers of influenza proteins, and even more innovative substrates to cultivate virus, including plant cells.",

For example, at that time, only a few hundred settlers were in the London region near the Royal London Hospital, now a community of four million people. At that time a traveler would have to walk a 100 miles to find another small settlement, perhaps at Stonehenge near Salisbury.",

            "text": "Nowadays we have a truly global community of six billion people, linked so that two million people are moving each day by plane, while perhaps ten million are journeying in their homelands. Influenza, like all viruses, is opportunistic. In 1918, it had the unprecedented opportunity to spread at the end of the first global war. Ten million soldiers began the move homewards, and every steamship was packed as they fanned out from France to England, Europe, the USA, Canada, Australia, India, and SE Asia [1] [2] [3] . How perfect for a virus spread by aerosol droplets, close contact, and contamination of towels, cups, and every day utensils. A virgin population, which had never before encountered the avian virus (H1N1), was on the stage of this theater of infection. Perhaps, a billion people were infected in the next 18 months, and 50-60 million died, making this by far the biggest outbreak of infectious diseases ever recorded, with an impact many times greater than the so-called bubonic plague outbreaks in Medieval Europe. However, more than two billion people survived. The overall mortality was less than 1%, although in a few semi-closed societies of hunter-gatherers in the Arctic, the mortality from the disease and subsequent starvation as young hunters died and husky dogs attacked and ate the survivors exceeded 90% [4] [5] [6] [7] . It is well to remember that when H1N1 emerged in 1916/1917 and became pandemic in 1918 everyone except for the over 70s were fully susceptible. This is different from today where most people on planet earth have immune memory to the H1N1 family of viruses and by definition to A/Swine flu. This explains why the current H1N1 vaccine is immunogenic. While most people in the world were infected, we are forced to view the innate protective power of our immune system with awe [8, 9] . We are equipped with 100,000 genes, seven million years of evolution, and 80,000 years of specialization since our emergence from Africa. In contrast, influenza is a miniscule eight-gene vehicle. A recent study [10] of the reproductive number (R0) of the 1918 virus suggests that, unexpectedly, it may have been quite low, not exceeding three persons infected with a single case. The current pandemic A/Swine H1N1 virus is not so different. This would place pandemic influenza not far above the lowly group of viruses such as small pox and SARS and not reaching the heights that measles has attained. However, this unexpected theoretical analysis, if it is not flawed, gives us more practical opportunities to break a chain of infection of a pandemic with antivirals, hygiene, and vaccines [11] [12] [13] . We are experimenting with these approaches at the present moment.",

For the first time in history, intense surveillance by the World Health Organization (WHO), early identification of a new pandemic influenza virus by molecular diagnostics, application of vaccination and antiviral chemoprophylaxis, and possible quarantine and masks could actually prevent a pandemic arising. For the expressed intention of WHO and the world community of infectious disease researchers is to deflect the first wave of the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. In this endeavor, our huge resources of natural innate immunity, assisted by new vaccines, are already helping us. The formulation of the vaccines and their stockpiling alongside antineuraminidase (NI) antivirals has needed significant investment of time and money, and this started with a three billion Euro investment from the USA and EU. We are presently gathering the fruits of this investment with the outbreak of A/Swine (H1N1) virus.",

Asia is where fire fighting must be done today.\" The Baroness had just heard the background science that China alone holds 700 million domestic ducks, a possible Trojan Horse of virus persistence, which approximates to 70% of the world's domestic duck population. Expert evidence from FAO had summarized that China, Indonesia, and Vietnam represented the core of the problem, but only 160 million dollars were available at that point in 2005/2006 to help, and biosecurity is not imposed strictly, while veterinary services are haphazard. The current pandemic virus emerged from pigs but a continuing threat is another reassortant event with H5N1 most likely in a coinfected child in Egypt or SE Asia where H5N1 viruses are endemic and where swine H1N1 viruses are spreading.",

[17] who correlated a HI titer of 40 with protective efficacy in volunteers in 1972 and then the discovery of a single radial diffusion for standardization of the hemagglutinin (HA) content of vaccines by Schild in 1973, it is quite apparent that the technologies are all now well tried and tested [18] . The elucidation of the structure of the fragmented influenza genome [19] has quickly led to techniques, genetic reassortment, and correlation of functions with certain genes (Fig. 3) . From a practical viewpoint, some old much passaged viruses such as A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) grew to extraordinary infectious titers in the egg allantoic cavity, exceeding a new wild-type virus by 100fold or more. Why not create a reassortant in the laboratory with six replicative genes of A/PR/8/34 to give high replication while having the two new HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the new epidemic virus? This technique proved to be a masterstroke and in the last quarter of a century three laboratories, CSL in Fig. 1 The classic hemagglutination inhibition test. The test depends upon interaction of eight HA units of virus that would normally agglutinate 0.5% turkey red blood cells. Preincubation of this standard virus with dilutions of serum antibody abrogates the agglutinating property of the virus (vertical rows 5 and 9). No antibody is detectable in rows 1-4, [6] [7] [8] Melbourne, NIBSC in London, and Ed Kilbourne's laboratory in New York, have rushed each year to produce the new candidate vaccine viruses prefixed IVR-, NIB-, and X-, respectively.

The genome could be labeled with 32P extracted and separated on polyacrylamide gels with influenza was also central to producing host range mutants with attenuation genes for live vaccines. Some of the starter and seed viruses for the current production of A/California/4/09 H1N1 (Swine) vaccine used this biological technology, while others used reverse genetics to make a GM starter virus.",

To avoid the relatively high rate of local and general systemic reactions caused by the older egg-grown inactivated whole-virus vaccines, chemical treatment to disrupt the particle and to separate the wanted antigens (HA and NA) from other constituents of the virus has led to a variety of different split or subunit vaccines . Ether extraction [27, 28] , deoxycholate treatment [29] , and treatment with other detergents have been introduced. Some methods have provided subunit vaccines causing fewer clinical side reactions than the older whole-virus particle vaccines, but drawbacks have appeared, including that of reduced antigenicity. Adjuvants of oily emulsions promised potent vaccines with excellent antibody responses, and a few reactions were first encountered. However, a rare abscess at the site of inoculation caused much distress and this early approach had to be abandoned.

In retrospect, this technique was not hugely accurate especially for subunit and split viruses. In a major technological breakthrough, Schild et al. [18] proposed a method of assay based on single radial immunodiffusion (SRD) (Fig. 7) . The HA antigen content of vaccines was estimated using SRD tests in agarose gels containing specific HI antibodies. The SRD method was modified and refined by Wood et al. [39] . It may be gradually replaced now by HPMC technologies. The SRD technique was valid for both whole-virus and split-virus vaccines and was quickly adopted for international use and is still the gold standard. In this test, vaccine virus preparations and reference antigen calibrated in terms of micrograms of HA are disrupted with detergent, and dilutions of the treated antigens are introduced into wells in SRD immunoplates. The size of the precipitation ring obtained for the vaccine is compared with that obtained with a reference antigen of calibrated HA content titrated on the same plate. The vaccine potency is measured in terms of micrograms of HA per vaccine dose.

            "text": "It has been known for many years that the serological response to inactivated vaccine depends on the previous experience of the recipient to infection by viruses of the same subtype of influenza A virus as that present in the vaccine. Although a single subcutaneous injection of (H1N1) vaccine gave as good a response as two doses prior to 1957, the advent of the new pandemic A/Asian (H2N2) virus produced a different effect. Thus, Holland et al. [40] demonstrated that two doses at an interval of two or more weeks produced a better response to one dose and in this regard the vaccine-induced immune response was much inferior to that noted Single radial diffusion (SRD) test to standardize HA. Vaccine antigen is pipetted into 3-mm wells in an agar plate containing specific anti-HA, -NA, and -NP antibodies. After a few hours incubation, a zone of precipitation is quantified and the area is proportional to the quantity of HA in the vaccine before the change in virus subtype. Such an experience was again noted during the first year of circulation of A/Hong Kong (H3N2) virus and also when the A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1) vaccine was used in children and young adults. Also, in the circumstances of 1977-1978, when most persons under 25 years of age had no previous antibody to the recirculating H1N1 virus, a two-dose regimen for children and young adults produced a more satisfactory response than a single injection [41] . To reiterate, in 1977 an \"old\" H1N1 virus from the 1950s was accidentally released from a laboratory and established itself as an epidemic virus. It was called a \"pseudo pandemic.\" Everyone over 24 years had previous immunity. The contrast between the effects of a single dose of vaccine in persons infected with H1N1 viruses at least 20 years earlier was very striking. These data have immediate relevance today in terms of H5N1 vaccine and of course with the A/Swine vaccine. The world is full of immune virgins as regards H5N1 but not in the case of A/Swine H1N1. Most persons have immune memory to the H1N1 family, and therefore it comes as no surprise that vaccines induce high levels of HI antibody. Several factors are of importance in the determination of the quantity and the precise composition of the antibody response to the surface antigens of the virus present in inactivated vaccine. First and foremost, the quantities of HI and NI antibodies induced by vaccine are broadly related to the quantity of antigen present in a single dose. Second, the precise composition of the antibodies formed in response to influenza A virus is important. Thus, reinforcement of previously acquired antibodies by the orientation of the B-lymphocyte response to the first infection by the particular subtype of virus experienced in childhood or later may take precedence over the strain-specific antibody response to the vaccine virus. Third, the precise response is influenced by the route by which the vaccine is presented to the body's immune system.",

The serum HI response was tested with four different H2N2 viruses isolated 1962-1967 and also the homologous virus. With more than a tenfold increase in HA from the least to the highest dose, the geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibody increased only fivefold. Similar results were obtained by Potter et al. [43] , who inoculated student volunteers with vaccines ranging in dosage from 5 to 400 IU and containing A/Port Chalmers/73 (H3N2) virus. The vaccine was a surface-antigen detergent-treated material [44] adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide gel. GMT HI serum titers increased against homologous virus from 8-to 174-fold with the increase in dose of vaccine HA. Three other H3N2 strains and A/Singapore/57 (H2N2) virus were also tested, and all three H3N2 viruses showed graded HI antibody responses proportional in magnitude to increase in antigen dose, as did the homologous virus.",

Those less than 44 years of age, who did not possess significant serum HI antibody to the virus before immunization, showed a postvaccination antibody titer ranging from 64 to 148 GMT with a nearly eightfold increase in dose from 8 to 61 mg of HA. Above this age, in those 45-64 with preexisting Hsw1 antibody, there was an increase in antibody titer from 7 to 36 times (GMT) with a change in HA concentration from 4 to 61 mg. Thus, the effect of increasing the potency of this vaccine on the antibody response was much greater in those sera, which indicated that they had been exposed to the antigen, presumably by infection with a related virus, than in those with no such exposure. Both whole and detergent-split-virus vaccines showed a relatively poor HI response in volunteers less than 25 years of age whose initial serum had no significant amount of prevaccination or postinfection HI antibody. In this group of subjects, two doses of vaccine gave a better antibody response than did one, but the resultant postvaccination GMT was half that obtained with a single dose of the vaccineover 25 years of age. This historical data is very relevant to us today as we analyze the HI data from the current batches of A/Swine H1N1 vaccine where in the over 5 years a single dose of vaccine is sufficient because of wide preexposure to members of the H1N1 family of viruses. The younger groups had no prior immune memory to the H1N1 family of virus, their experience being more orientated to H2N2 and H3N2 families.",

Yet the trial of A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1) vaccine conducted by the Pandemic Working Group of the MRC Influenza Vaccine Committee [45] found only a slight increase in NI antibody after an increased dose from 100 to 200 IU using 100 IU of HA in the vaccine. Nicholson et al. [41] gave a whole-virus vaccine of the A/USSR/77 (H1N1) virus, which ranged in potency up to sixfold, and found, in those under 25, a threefold increase in NI antibody. However, in those over 25 years of age, an increase in dose of vaccine had a less constant effect on NI antibody formation. One possible reason for the variation in the effect of different vaccines on the NI antibody is the lack of consistency in the NA content [51] ; however, another possibility may be that immunological priming to the HA in the vaccine can in some way suppress the immunogenicity of the NA antigen, which may be physically associated with the HA.",

The differentiation of these require special techniques such as SRD and the adsorption studies. Webster et al. [52] compared, in adults, the response to an A/Port Chalmers/73 (H3N2) subunit vaccine to homologous and heterologous H3N2 viruses. Most of the antibody was cross-reactive with A/Hong Kong/68 virus but when higher doses of the vaccines were used, strain-specific A/Port Chalmers/ 73 antibody was produced in addition to that against heterologous virus. Oxford et al. [53, 54] compared whole-and split-virus vaccines containing A/Victoria/75 or A/Scotland/74 viruses and using single radial hemolysis and adsorption techniques showed that in an immunized adult, cross-reactive antibody was induced much more frequently than specific antibody against homologous virus. They showed the same phenomenon in adults during infection with A/Port Chalmers/73 virus, who frequently also developed antibody rises to A/Hong Kong antigens from 1968. Oxford et al. [54] used similar techniques to analyze sera from children aged 3-6 years immunized with a surface-antigen vaccine containing A/Victoria/75 (H3N2) antigens. Most children produced a strain-specific serum antibody to the vaccine antigens, whereas adults similarly vaccinated tended to produce antibody cross-reacting with all variants of the H3N2 subtype tested. Postepidemic sera from those of various ages recently infected by A/Texas/77-like strain showed crossreactive antibody in adults but in contrast mostly strain-specific responses in children. Strain-specific antibody is considered to be more protective.",

The chief alternative to the subcutaneous-intramuscular route is intradermal injection using a reduced amount of vaccine. The advantages of this route are economy and the avoidance of febrile reaction. The principal disadvantage is the fact that the antibody response is less consistent. It was shown by Appleby et al. [55] that the GMT after intradermal vaccine was less than half that obtained with subcutaneous vaccine, and this seemed logical in that only one-tenth of the vaccine dose was given intradermally. McCarroll and Kilbourne [56] found little difference in the antibody responses to intradermal and subcutaneous vaccines in equivalent doses. Tauraso et al. [57] reinvestigated the question using a two-dose regime before the arrival of the A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) epidemic. In the equivalent amount of 0.1 ml of vaccine, antibodies formed in higher titer after intradermal than subcutaneous vaccine. However, the titers after 0.5 ml of vaccine subcutaneously were little different from intradermal injection of 0.1 ml. It is considered advisable, however, in practice to limit intradermal vaccination when the vaccine is in short supply or when, in children or the aged, reactions after subcutaneous vaccine might pose problems.",

Challenge of immunized groups of persons by live-attenuated virus also supports the view that nasal antibodies play a supplementary role to serum HI antibody [63] . [51] . After a second dose of the same vaccine, fewer volunteers experienced reactions than seen after the first dose. Later studies of the endotoxin content of various pools of inactivated type A or B vaccines using the limulus lysate test gave no hint of a parallel between the occurrence of general reactions and the endotoxin content [64] .",

Wells [65] noted the rare instance of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), which appeared in excess among the persons vaccinated with A/Swine vaccine compared with the numbers in unvaccinated individuals. Of 1,098 persons with GBS reported from October 1, 1976, to the January 31, 1977, 532 had received vaccine before the onset of neurological symptoms. The overall risk of GBS was calculated as ten cases per million vaccinated. The rate of occurrence during the 10-week swine vaccine period was five to six times greater than in unvaccinated persons. However, the excess in number was greater in the second and third weeks after inoculation than either the first or subsequent weeks. As reported by Langmuir [66] , GBS was not associated with a particular variety of vaccine or age group. However, that numbers were slightly greater in those aged 25-44 than in middle aged or elderly persons, which appears to rule out the possibility that the syndrome was, in some way, related to the absence of antibodies to the swine virus before immunization, for most of those aged over 45 would have been exposed to antigens of this virus many years before. After the swine influenza campaign was terminated, surveillance was continued, and during the period 1978-1979, when 12.5 million doses of ordinary inactivated vaccine were estimated to have been used, the related risk of GBS was 1.4 times the incidence in unvaccinated persons. This risk was regarded as not significant [67] . No clue to the cause of the marginally increased risk of GBS in immunized persons in 1976 has yet been obtained but could be virus strain related. No untoward effects have been noted in the billions of vaccines used since 1979 to the present day.",

Inactivated polyvalent vaccine containing two H2N2 viruses (A/England/64 and A/England/66) and a B strain were compared with an H3N2 A/Hong Kong whole or deoxycholate-treated virus vaccine in initial serological trials. Antibody formation even in those without detectable serum HI antibody gave GMTs over 100 in those receiving A/Hong Kong vaccine intramuscularly. However, controlled trials in two boarding schools showed no convincing evidence of protection. In uncontrolled trials in other schools either the polyvalent or the A/Hong Kong vaccine were given or no vaccine at all. There were 12 schools where epidemics of influenza occurred in January and February 1969 but no evidence of protection was found in those receiving A/HK vaccines. The only clue obtained concerning the vaccine failure was first that only one dose of vaccine had been given, and this is known to be inadequate to give a satisfactory antibody response in previously seronegative persons, and second, there was an interval between vaccine administration and infection of 2-4 months. These two factors may have combined to explain the absence of protection because of the inadequacy of the antibody response at the time of challenge. It would be fair to add that others [68, 69] did obtain protection from A/Hong Kong/68 whole-virus vaccine during the first outbreak of influenza due to this virus in the USA. The use of modern adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine in two doses is anticipated to give protective effects. The current A/Swine vaccines produce protective HI antibody (>40) in most persons over 5 years of age following a single dose. As emphasized above, this reassuring situation is because most persons have prior immunity to the H1N1 family of viruses which circulated between 1918 and 1957 and then again from 1977 to the present day.",

The major difficulty of the lack of a laboratory test to indicate that cultured virus had lost its pathogenicity, while retaining infectivity for man, meant that deliberate intranasal inoculation of volunteers furnished the only way to select a suitable strain for infection without causing clinical reaction. In spite of the widespread adoption of live vaccines selected by this method and given as an intranasal spray in the USSR, little interest was exhibited in most other countries. From 1956 onwards, trials took place in volunteers in England and Wales to provide evidence of safety and immunogenicity of cultured viruses and the drawback of a reduced infectivity of well-attenuated viruses handicapped progress. The necessity to observe a match between the antigens of epidemic viruses and those present in the vaccine was a further drawback until the technique of reassortment of characters between two strains, one of which was of proven attenuation, was utilized to yield seed viruses with the desirable clinical and antigenic properties. Other disadvantages of live viruses appeared during the intensive researches of the 1980s particularly in the USA and in England [71, 72] . It cannot yet be claimed that the ideal live-attenuated virus vaccine has been formulated, but reverse genetics and increased knowledge of virulence genes have now lead to a resurgence of interest. In the 1980s, genetic studies were intensively pursued in attempts first to define the particular gene or combination of genes, donated by the attenuated virus that confers the property of attenuation upon the reassortant strain. It was found that the biological properties of excreted virus may be altered compared with those of the original virus in the vaccine and the manner of this alteration was also studied genetically. Such work is essential in achieving the goal of an effective and safe vaccine virus for human use. Experimental inoculations were carried out initially in small-scale tests in volunteers under semi-isolation to permit close observation (see below).",

As a donor parent with good powers of multiplication in the laboratory, PR8 was mated with various strains of wild-type influenza A viruses to obtain recombinants with up-to-date surface HA and NA antigens. This method was preferable to simple laboratory cultivation because some viruses failed to alter in pathogenicity after as many as 30 serial passes in cultures [73] , although other virus strains appeared to become attenuated with only a few passages in eggs.",

Earlier passages were made in chick kidney tissue cultures followed by intranasal passages in mice and then a gradual adaptation to lower temperatures, in tissue cultures and in developing hens' eggs inoculated allantoically, led to a virus with good powers of multiplication at 25 C. The ca variant was found to retain the infectivity of the original strain for both the mouse and the ferret, although it produced no deaths in mice and no fever or turbinate lesions in ferrets, whereas the original virus was pathogenic for both species. The virus proved to be temperature sensitive with a shut-off temperature of 37 C [87] . Recombinants with wild-type viruses of both H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes were prepared, studied in the laboratory and in volunteers, and analyzed genetically. The original A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) virus was not, however, tested in fully susceptible persons presumably because of the difficulty in that period of finding seronegative adults. A few persons with low titers of serum neutralizing antibodies (1:4 to 1:6) were inoculated and as judged by antibody responses, became infected without undergoing clinical illnesses. More rigorous clinical studies have been pursued with recombinants, in particular, those with H3N2 antigens, and details of the results have been brought together and earlier data summarized by Kendal [72] . The donor ca parent has been more recently reassorted with H5N1 genes.",

Many more groups are now using these technologies to produce the current A/Swine H1N1 vaccine. Capacity can be increased to cope with a surge in demand for a pandemic virus vaccine. Moreover, the final vaccine has the theoretical advantage of the absence of egg proteins. The cell culture vaccine virus is also easier to purify. Where clinical isolates of influenza viruses are cultivated in mammalian cells and eggs in parallel, different antigenic variants may be selected [94] . The biological variants have amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding site in proximity to an antigenic site on the HA, and an amino acid change in this region can alter antigenicity. Of the two virus subpopulations that can be selected, the virus which is grown on MDCK (or Vero) cells rather than in eggs appears more closely related to the wild-type clinical virus. There is some indication that cell-grown virus vaccines offer greater protection in animal models than the corresponding egg-grown vaccine. These are all powerful arguments in favor of the new generation of influenza vaccines being cultivated currently in Vero [22] or MDCK [23] or Per 6 cells.",

Most manufacture is still located within the EU, but production is increasing in the USA, Korea, Japan, China, and most recently, India. The international collaboration in face of the outbreak of A/California/4/09 (H1N1) in Mexico around Christmas 2008 to the present, the exchange of clinical data and viruses enabled vaccine manufacture to start production by May/June 2009. By October 2009, the production of hundreds of millions of doses of a monovalent vaccine containing 15 mg of HA and immunogenic after a single ion dose in the over 5-year olds is a quite remarkable achievement. Many countries have started to immunize at-risk groups, namely younger people <65 years of age with diabetes, obesity, chronic heart, or lung problems, and the immunosuppressed including pregnant women. It is forecast that up to 40-50% of some countries could volunteer for the vaccine. It is especially important that medical and nursing staff take the vaccine to protect both themselves and their patients. However, such large vaccination campaigns open schisms in modern societies,which on the one hand become very concerned about young persons dying but on the other hand have prejudices about vaccines in general. In the first winter wave the over 65s, unusually for a pandemic virus, are protected by prior experience of the H1N1 family and hence overall mortality is likely to be less than a seasonal year but the mortality is likely to be in younger persons, thus exposing our Achilles heel.

However, it has been difficult to construct a solid database and there has been a lingering doubt about this so-called cross-protective immunity. Most virologists deduced, virtually by elimination, that a cross-reactive portion of the HA (HA2) could have provided the cross protection. Furthermore, this cross protection is particularly seen in the mouse model, leading some to conclude that the mouse recognized cross protection epitopes that perhaps humans did not.",

The M2 protein is an integral membrane protein of influenza A viruses that is expressed at the plasma membrane of virus-infected cells and is also present in small amounts on virions. The important extracellular domain, potentially targeted by antibodies and T cells, is conserved by virtually all influenza A viruses. Even the 1918 pandemic virus differs only in one amino acid. The first indication that the M2 was immunologically active was the observation that an anti-M2 monoclonal antibody reduced the spread of virus cell culture. Not unexpectedly, the antibody reacted with the extracellular domain of M2. Even more excitingly, the antibody reduced the replication of virus in mouse lungs. Immunization studies with M2 constructs, however, have given more mixed results. Immunization of mice with DNA plasmid of M1 and M2 gene gave protection mainly via T-helper cell activity. An alternative approach utilized a hepatitis B core and M2 fusion protein. The cross protection resided in antibodies, although M2specific antibodies did not neutralize the virus in vitro. Presumably, protection was mediated by an indirect mechanism such as complement-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependant cytotoxicity. However, the protection induced in the mouse model was considerably less than that induced by a conventional sub unit HA/NA vaccine.",

The ultimate test is in influenza-infected volunteers. This specialized work was initiated over 60 years ago. During the great pandemic of 1918, when the precise nature of the causative microbe of the Spanish influenza had not been established, a group of American scientists asked for young volunteers from the army and navy. The quest was to probe the nature of the microbe that was already causing devastation in their own country and where, by 1919, 500,000 young people were to die. However, this was not the first study into the precise nature of the microbe. The infection had first been documented a year earlier as a herald wave in the great city-sized military base and encampment of Etaples [6, 12] . Here the British army constructed the largest establishment [97] in its history, where 100,000 newly recruited soldiers each day intermingled with thousands of wounded soldiers, pigs and, in the nearby villages and markets, with ducks, domestic chickens, and geese. These are now recognized as the necessary biological features of an epicenter for the creation of a pandemic virus. We surmise, in retrospect, that an avian virus from a silently infected goose or duck could have crossed species either to a pig or to a soldier already infected with a human strain of influenza. This is the mixing bowl hypothesis. Indeed, common epidemic influenza was known to be circulating in the winter of 1916-1917 in Etaples. Another factor in Etaples could have been the hundreds of tons of gases of 25 varieties contaminating the landscape of the nearby Somme battlefield, as well as many of the wounded soldiers brought by the night trains into the 12 hospitals on site and causing respiratory distress. A group of pathologists there and at Abbeville, led by G. Gibson, raised the question of the nature of the microbe. Could it be a Gram-negative bacterium such as H. influenzae, already described by Pfeiffer as the cause of the previous influenza pandemic of 1889? Or could it be a virus? Viruses were rather unknown entities at that time but had been identified by their filter-passing nature. Hence, Gibson's experiment was quite simply to take sputum from a soldier victim and filter it through a Berkefield candle filter, which would hold back any known bacterium but allow the passage of the much smaller ultrafilterable virus. But what then? Gibson had not even considered that a human volunteer would receive the filtrate. In fact, he gave it to a series of macaques and, inadvertently, to himself. He died and the macaques became ill. His premature discovery of new virus influenza has lain undiscovered and hitherto unquoted in the archives of the First World War [98] .",

With Christopher Andrewes as its first chief scientist, the unit recruited volunteers to unravel the virological mysteries of respiratory disease. For the next 40 years, a small team of virologists and clinicians infected volunteers and discovered the first human coronavirus, the common cold virus, and were the first to describe the clinical effects of interferons.

            "text": "The considerable difficulties encountered in mounting field trials led to experiments in which immunized volunteers were subjected to deliberate inoculation with live virus in the form of either attenuated strain or modified wild-type strain. This protocol was suggested by Henle et al. [99] , who immunized a group of children with inactivated influenza A (H1N1) virus vaccine and then inoculated them with egg-cultured virus of the same subtype but recently isolated, by inhalation of an aerosol. High rates of infection (75%) were produced in 28 unimmunized children of whom 10 became ill. Those receiving vaccine either escaped subsequent infection or developed serological changes; only 1 child of the 42 vaccinated children thus challenged became ill. Although this study illustrated the outstanding success of the immunized protocol, there are probably few observers today who would be prepared to submit their children to a similar risk of deliberately induced illness. Ideally young adults 18-45 are used for quarantine experiments. Such a risk is, of course, experienced during epidemics and Bell et al. [100] undertook a similar experiment in adult volunteers some of whom were immunized with a single dose of inactivated A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2) virus vaccine soon after the A/Asian epidemic began. The volunteers were isolated before being given intranasally pooled nasopharyngeal washings from patients with influenza and this caused clinical illness in 87% of volunteers previously given a placebo. As 50% of the vaccinated volunteers developed fever after challenge in this experiment, the single injection of inactivated vaccine proved relatively ineffective, presumably because of its inadequate immunogenicity. The information obtained by deliberate challenge of immunized volunteers has been explored in the past using modified attenuated virus strains. Beare et al. [73] did this in their comparison of inactivated or live influenza B vaccines in which a challenge from the live virus B strain was used to assess the comparative efficacy of the two vaccines. Reinoculation with live virus was resisted better by those receiving the same material a month previously than by those injected with inactivated vaccine.",

This virus will be a lot more difficult to deal with than A/Swine H1N1. We would then be \"at the end of the beginning\" as regards protection of all citizens. Influenza was the twentieth century's weapon of mass destruction. Nature is the greatest bioterrorist of our world and emerging viruses could do for us all, as easily and as quickly, or even more so, than the Great Influenza of 1918, except for the fact that we now have the ammunition to fight back: knowledge of virus transmission and how to break it with disinfectants and social distancing, and effective antivirals and vaccines. The current A/Swine H1N1 pandemic has exposed flaws in pandemic plans and also has exposed many countries that have no preparation whatsoever.",

The splitvirus type of vaccine then used unquestionably caused fewer systemic febrile responses in both children and adults. The fact that reactions with whole-virus vaccines used at the time were unpleasantly severe for those without serum antibodies to the vaccine virus before inoculation had not been fully appreciated. In the case of children aged 6-18 in the American trials of A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1) virus, the most potent vaccines caused fever in up to 63% of vaccines. In the UK, the Pandemic Working Group of the MRC Committee on Influenza Vaccine found that a dose of 61 mg of HA (1,000 IU) of whole-virus vaccine with the same Hsw1N1 strain produced, in adults, local reactions in 50% and systemic effects in over 60% of volunteers. Even the lower doses of 18-27 mg of HA caused local reactions in 50% and systemic effects in 40%. The A/USSR/77 (H1N1) virus vaccine trial in 1978 in Britain showed that adsorbed or aqueous split-virus vaccine produced fewer reactions than did whole virus",
