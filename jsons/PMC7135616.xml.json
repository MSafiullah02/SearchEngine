In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recognized the value of information and referral (I&R) services by assigning the three-digit dialing code 2-1-1 for authorized use by information and referral providers. In their report and order, the FCC underscored the public need that exists for an easy-to-use, easy-to-remember N11 code to efficiently bring community information and referral services to those who need them, providing a national safety network for persons to get access readily to assistance.1\n",

United Way operates roughly 40% of the 2-1-1 program, and 60% are operated by a variety of nonprofit and municipal agencies.

Resource database records include eligibility factors, application processes, days and hours of service delivery, and specific service/site locations, as well as fees charged, where applicable. Additionally, 2-1-1 information specialists collect information on the callers' demographics, which may include ZIP-code, destination where services are needed, problems or needs expressed, gender, age, race/ethnicity, language spoken, and special situations such as veteran or active military status, homeless, pregnant, or recently unemployed, as well as follow-up contact information as appropriate.

Community-based data reviewed in the aftermath of Katrina show how migration patterns affected the health and human service needs of host communities that welcomed the evacuees. Surveillance data based on calls inquiring about the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto and H1N1 across the U.S. in 2009\u20132010 led to focused health messaging. In fact, the economic recession that began in 2008 was forecast in the reviews of 2007 data. That year, 2-1-1 systems in United Way for Southeast Michigan and Greater Cleveland Ohio began to notice that call trends for utility assistance continued to rise. But more importantly, a significant number of calls for low-cost housing search assistance, foreclosure counseling, and bankruptcy were on the rise as well. The surveillance provided by these 2-1-1 systems led to conversations with county and state coalitions. The looming crisis was identified and prevention strategies were launched. The early intervention by the Cuyahoga County coalition reported saving 600 families from housing foreclosures. Thus, future surveillance partnerships and activities of 2-1-1 systems may lead to more efficient and outcome-oriented prevention strategies and allocation of resources.",

In addition, 2-1-1 data and research results have the potential to greatly enhance the national dialogue about how we achieve healthier and more resilient communities. Although these projects inspire, they also raise questions for 2-1-1 practitioners and researchers alike.",

To be full partners, the 2-1-1 network will need to standardize on a minimal set of data elements with standard definitions to facilitate comparative analyses. In addition, 2-1-1 systems will need to agree to a consistency of practice in how and what data are collected as well as for what purposes.
