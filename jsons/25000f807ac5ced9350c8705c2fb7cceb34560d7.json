The level of similarity (homogeneity) or difference (heterogeneity) within a species population indicates the diversity of the gene pool. This diversity can be assessed through the observation of expressed genetic traits (phenotype) or by determining the variants of individual genes (genotype). Such information can then be related to understanding the molecular basis of pathogenesis and disease transmission, for example, as well as deciphering the evolutionary history of a species. Understanding genetic variation is also important in the analysis of an organism's transcriptome, where a change in gene expression may result from coding sequence variability rather than differential gene regulation.",

A single nucleotide change, or polymorphism, results in either a change in amino acid (non-synonymous) or a silent mutation, where no change in amino acid occurs (synonymous). Recombination produces di\u00a1erent combinations of alleles as a result of the physical exchange of DNA between two di\u00a1erent chromosomes in the case of higher organisms, or between another isolate or closely related species in the case of prokaryotic organisms. Other sources of genetic variation can be sequence rearrangements, genetic insertions and/or deletions.

            "text": "The genetic analysis of organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, is a fast-moving and expanding scientific field. Population diversity can be measured by a variety of techniques, with the simplest method being an assessment of the observed phenotype of a population, such as eye colour or hair colour. However, for those species where the expressed phenotypes are not readily determined, biochemical and molecular approaches are needed for a more in-depth analysis of genetic relatedness. At the moment there is a wide-ranging number of approaches available for identifying genetic diversity or relatedness in a population. These include Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) (Beadle et al. 2003) , microsatellite mapping (Dearlove 2002) , along with more recent techniques such as mass spectrometry-based genotyping (Pusch et al. 2002) . However, while traditional techniques, such as PFGE, are highly discriminatory and have added greatly to the study of genetic diversity, they do not illustrate the total variability of the organism in question. The only way to show total variability is to sequence the genome. The advances in whole genome DNA sequencing within the last few years have permitted considerable progress towards the assessment of genetic diversity within certain organisms (Bentley & Parkhill 2004) . Comparative genomics can facilitate a detailed catalogue of the biological similarities and differences between species, revealing fascinating insights into the genome evolution and biology of numerous organisms (Herrero et al. 2003 , Nelson et al. 2004 , McClelland et al. 2004 ). However, typically, only one strain or individual of a particular species is sequenced, thereby limiting the extent of analysis possible by this whole-genome approach.",

A\u00a1ymetrix (A\u00a1ymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) have pioneered the production of the high-density array in which photolithographic chemistry is utilized to synthesize in situ short oligonucleotides, typically 25-mers directly onto the microarray platform (Lockhart & Winzeler 2000) .",

However, spotted PCR amplicons only facilitate a limited coverage of the genome and, due to the size of each PCR product representing an ORF, issues of cross hybridization can also arise. Inconsistencies in the hybridization properties of long oligonucleotide probes can also be an issue. Consequently, although the high-density oligonucletide array platform overcomes both of these issues, the photolithographic manufacturing process required to directly build the 25-mer feature onto the microarray platform signi\u00a2cantly reduces the \u00a3exibility of this system. However, such an array produces better speci\u00a2city, quality control and portability and the smaller feature size allows for signi\u00a2cantly greater coverage of any genome. The increased number of probes for every ORF also permits novel observations that would be impossible using glass spotted microarrays.",

The probes contain all possible sequences at the site of the SNP, and multiplex hybridizations are undertaken (Hacia et al. 1998 ). In the A\u00a1ymetrix GeneChip assay, a computer algorithm is then implemented to assign the genotype of each SNP. However, while SNP detection and genotyping in humans is now feasible on a microarray platform, mapping studies in which 400^500 SNPs were analysed using high-density allele-speci\u00a2c oligonucleotide microarrays showed that the assay failed to distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous SNP genotypes for a large fraction of the SNPs (Wang et al. 1998) . Indeed, the PCR ampli\u00a2cation step required to achieve sensitive and speci\u00a2c SNP genotyping is a principal factor that limits the use of high-throughput hybridizationbased assays in human SNP genotyping (Syvanen 2001) . To overcome such issues, approaches including DNA-polymerase assisted single nucleotide primer extension are now being implemented in order to perform parallel genotyping of SNPs on microarrays. In studies, this method provided a ten-fold better power of discrimination between genotypes in comparison with hybridization with allele-speci\u00a2c oligonucleotide probes (Syvanen 2001) . Since a number of complex issues still remain with high-throughput microarray-based SNP genotyping in humans, in the remainder of this review, we will discuss the application of high-density oligonucleotide arrays to elucidate genetic diversity, with particular focus on studies undertaken with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Winzeler et al. 2003) , Arabidopsis thalania (Borevitz et al. 2003 ) and the pathogenic organisms, Plasmodium falciparum (Volkman et al. 2002) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tsolaki et al. 2004 ).

This microarray consisted of 4167 unique single-stranded 25-mer probes, positioned approximately every 200 nucleotides to provide complete coverage of all 93,000 base-pairs of chromosome 2 (Volkman et al. 2002) . The array also consisted of 395,833 probes for 80,000 cDNAs from human tissues so that the amount of host mRNA contamination occurring during the culture and extraction of the parasite DNA could be measured.

The enteric bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the cause of human gastroenteritis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, which causes human typhoid, share 97.6% identity at the genome level (Edwards et al. 2002 ), yet 11% of S. typhimurium genes are lost or inactivated (pseudogene) in the S. typhi genome.

Chromosomal gene deletions in humans can be attributed to a host of clinical outcomes. A large deletion in a region of the long arm of chromosome 7 is associated with the cause of Williams-Beuren syndrome and loss of the long arm of chromosome 4 has been identified previously as a common occurrence in adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction (Rumpel et al. 1999) .",

            "text": "There is no doubt that the DNA microarray is a powerful tool that has revolutionized the field of genetic diversity. A single hybridization can quickly yield vast quantities of data on the relatedness of one strain to another, at a single base-pair resolution. While traditional typing techniques suffer from severe limitations, microarrays offer a comprehensive and unbiased approach to analysing diversity and permit observations that would be overlooked with established techniques where only small regions of a given genome are investigated. In today's society, accurately distinguishing between closely related strains is essential in cases of pathogens associated with food-borne diseases or bioterrorism. Indeed, microarrays played a critical role in epidemiological studies concerned with the emergence of the deadly new pathogen, SARS. We also foresee the application of microarrays in the typing and classification of organisms such as bacteria and viruses where traditional antibody typing can sometimes fall short. In summary, the application of oligonucleotide arrays in elucidating genetic diversity is immense and will continue to make a significant impact in future population and evolutionary genetic studies.",
