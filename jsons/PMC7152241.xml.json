RISC can employ one single-strand RNA from small dsRNA fragments (siRNA or miRNA) as template to recognize complementary mRNA, then the Argonaute protein will induce the cleavage or suppression of the mRNA transcript and result in RNA interference.RNA interferenceRibonucleic acid interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules.Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)shRNA is an artificial molecule, which consists of two complementary 19\u201322 nt RNA sequences linked by a 4\u201311 nt short loop and 2 nt overhangs at 3\u2032 end that is similar to pre-miRNA so-called stem-loop structure.Small interfering RNA (siRNA)siRNA, sometimes known as short interfering RNA, is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20\u201325 base pairs in length, similar to miRNA, and operating within the RNAi pathway.\n",

Napoli and Jorgensen claimed a transgene-induced \u201ccosuppression\u201d of endogenous chalcone synthase gene during generation of hybridized violet petunias.1 Later in 1992, a similar phenomenon was observed by Romano and Macino in Neurospora crassa.2 They described a \u201cquelling\u201d of the endogenous gene caused by the introduction of homologous RNA sequences. However, RNAi event in animal was first reported in Caenorhabditis elegans by Guo and Kemphues until 1995, noting introducing sense or antisense RNA can lead to the degradation of par-1 mRNA. At the time, homologous antisense RNA was regarded as the tool of silencing to hybridize with endogenous mRNAs then form double-stranded RNA to stop translation. Guo and Kemphues used only sense par-1 RNA has no hybridization capacity with the endogenous par-1 transcript in their validation. Interestingly, the degradation of par-1 mRNA was still observed. The results raised questions and uncertainty of potential regulation mechanism remaining undiscovered.3\n",

            "text": "Followed the investigation of these paradoxical findings, Fire and Mello published a paper stating possible explanations of \u201ccosuppression, quelling and sense mRNA\u201d against endogenous genes in 1998.4 In their C. elegans models, they had employed both purified single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeted mRNA of unc-22 gene. The dsRNAs consistently demonstrated higher efficacy than either ssRNAs in gene silencing results of individual and whole population. They proposed dsRNA could be the trigger of stoichiometric implicating integrated against endogenous mRNA in vivo, and possible catalytic or amplification components played a highlighting role during the interference process. These regional developing into systemic silencing effects required a stable intermediate system. Then, Hamilton and Baulcombe first demonstrated the existence of stable intermediate system in plants to support this hypothesis. They suggested dsRNAs need to unwind and the antisense RNA strand served as a guide to bind to the mRNA. Though full length antisense strand were never found, an estimated 25 nt antisense RNA is required for the specific binding based on their observation.5 Besides, another two different teams found 21\u201323 nt RNAs could always be purified from Drosophila cells with RNAi, proposing a shorten convert of dsRNA mediated cleavage of targeted transcript.6 Researchers further used 21\u201322 nt chemical synthesized dsRNA to determine this system in various species, finding short dsRNA mediated gene silencing also exist in mammalian cells.7 Ambros's group found both lin-4 and let-7 genes can encode short temporal mature RNAs in the length of 22 nt in C\n.\nelegans. These short RNAs were further identified as miRNA.8 Following investigation showed that genome sequences are tended to form hairpin loops, and these stem-loop sequences as precursor RNAs are the source of miRNAs. miRNA was demonstrated to have gene regulation effects at post-transcriptional level in various species.9\n",

Bernstein's team discovered RISC responsible to mRNA cleavage could be collected by high-speed centrifugation, whereas short converted dsRNA fragments still remained in the supernatant, which indicated the initiation phase of dsRNA cleavage into siRNA and the effect phase of mRNA cleavage destruction are the result of two different enzymatic activities.10 Hannon's group hypothesized the initiate phase enzyme should be a dsRNA ribonuclease and then chose different RNase III family enzymes for investigation.8 By using T7 epitope tag labeling and immunoprecipitation to quantify 21\u201323 nt siRNAs yields of different RNase III enzymes, they found only the enzyme encoded by gene CG4792 had the regulation activities and named it \u201cDicer\u201d.

Argonaute 1 and Argonaute 2 (Ago1 and Ago2) were isolated after purification. In 2004, Joshua-Tor's group purified an Argonaute protein from the archebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo).10 PfAgo has a PIWI domain sharing high similarity with RNase H enzymes and have two identical DDE (aspartate-aspartate-glutamate) motif catalytic carboxylates which are also required for the cleavage activities in RNase H. Based on these results, Joshua-Tor then collaborating with Hannon's group used immunoprecipitation to investigate Ago1-4 complexes activities in 293T cells.12 The results showed though siRNAs bound to all Ago proteins, but only Ago2 complex had cleavage activity. Hannon tried to mutate key amino acids of the PIWI domain in Ago2. The mutated Ago2 can only bind to siRNAs but has no cleavage capacity. Besides cleavage activities, how did siRNAs bind to RISC had raised a great research interest as well. Evidence showed only single-stranded siRNAs were found within RISC, which indicated a potential unwind and bind mechanism. Both Gregory's team and Matranga's team found Ago2 has the RNA helicase function to unwind duplex siRNAs, employ one guide strand to find complementary mRNA, remaining anti-guide strand will be cleaved and removed.13, 14 This mechanism is essential for the RISC activation. Although Ago2 hold function of cleaving both siRNA and target mRNA, only Ago2 protein could not recruit any siRNA. For RNAi event, researchers found RISC composed of Dicer, Ago2, and TRBP (the HIV-1 TAR RNA binding protein) is required. TRBP helps recruiting the Dicer complex to Ago2 which form a ternary complex induce RNAi activities.",

In Arabidopsis, unprimed RdRPs employed both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mRNA cleaved fragments as substrates to produce long dsRNAs. These dsRNAs were then cut by Dicer to generate secondary siRNAs and induced mRNA degradation. But in C\n.\nelegans, a different mechanism was described.

Dicer-2 associated with R2D2 can form a functional heterodimeric complex.19, 20 Unlike Loqs, R2D2 has only two dsRNA-binding domains which can interact with long dsRNA but does not regulate siRNA generation activities. R2D2 plays an important role in development and stability of Dicer-2. It has demonstrated that both dsRNA binding domains of R2D2 and Dicer-2 are essential to the process of Dcr-2/R2D2 complex binding with siRNAs then loading them into RISC.21 Structural analysis showed Dicer-2 has an RNA helicase domain, a DUF283 domain, an N terminus' PAZ domain, tandem RNase III motifs and a C terminus' dsRBD motif. Since Dicer-2 or R2D2 alone does not bind with siRNAs, which indicated siRNA might bind with the interface between R2D2 and Dicer-2 then triggered a conformational change on complex allows them to coordinately bind siRNA to promote assembly of the siRISC complexes.21\n",

There are three efficient and inexpensive delivery methods of siRNA: transfection, electroporation and viral vector. The first two are non-viral delivery, the rest one is, as the name implies, viral delivery. Transfection generally has three modes: cationic liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and lipid conjugation. It is relatively easy to transfect siRNAs into most of cell lines with high efficiency and reproducibility, and there are many commercial reagents offered. However, it is not suitable for all kinds of cells such as primary cells and non-dividing cells and has low efficiency in vivo.\n31 For hard-transfected primary cells, stem cells and neuronal cells, electroporation, another intracellular delivery method, could be a good choice. The cell membrane is consisted of phospholipid bilayer which is susceptible to electric shock. When there is a powerful voltage pulse, the lipid molecules will reorient to form hydrophilic pores to let nucleic acids in via electrical current. But different cell types need different optimal parameters, and this method is easier to make cell die. Viral-mediated delivery, similar as transduction, deliver siRNA through some recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAVs), adenovirus and lentivirus. It can be used for primary and non-dividing cells, compatible for in vivo experiments and stable expression. But problems arise because it can lead to possible mutagenic and immunogenic effects and need to generate and titrate viral particles.32\n",

Transfection can be used to introduce plasmids into cells which is similar as the transfection of siRNA. It can be accomplished by using commercial transfection reagents in vitro but cannot be used in vivo. Viral-mediated delivery also can be used for shRNA through some recombinant viral vectors based on adeno-associated virus, adenovirus and lentivirus. The gene construct is simple and small so that they can be easily inserted into vectors. The genomes of AAVs and adenoviruses are episomal so that they cannot be integrated into the genome of the host cells. In addition, AAVs have diminished packing capacity to limit the induction of immune responses in host cells. But with cell dividing, the virus will be lost quickly. Different from AAVs and adenoviruses, lentiviruses can integrate its own genome into sections of transcriptionally active chromatin and be passed on to progenies so that increase the risk of insertional mutagenesis. The other kind of vectors that can be used for delivery of shRNA is bacterial vector. Dr. Shuanglin Xiang and his co-workers engineered the Escherichia coli to produce plasmids of shRNA to knock down gene expression in vitro and in vivo.\n38\n",

The Dicer kit has already been commercialized (Genlantis). This method is cheaper and can obtain a large number of siRNAs.10, 48 In 2005, Dr. Dong-Ho Kim with his co-workers found that some dsRNAs have greater potency than synthetic 21 nt siRNAs directed to the same target site, and that this property seemed to correlate with length. With the increasing of the length of the siRNA, synthetic RNA duplexes 25\u201330 nt in length is 100-fold more potent. Especially, the duplex length of 27 nt has the maximal inhibitory and it doesn't induced interferon or activate protein kinase R (PKR). That means that synthetic RNAs that are substrates for Dicer are more potent than conventional RNAs. It is possibly because that increasing the length of an siRNA duplex with an unprocessed end is thermodynamically more stable and prompting the incorporation with Dicer/TRBP/PACT complex for more efficient RISC assembly.49\n",

Inhibition of miRNAs can alleviate their over-repression of target mRNAs and restore normal cell phenotype, so it is considered as a promising therapeutic strategy. Different from natural ones, artificial miRNA inhibitors are exogenous RNAs, including anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) and miRNA sponges. AMOs are single-stranded short RNA oligonucleotides that are fully complementary to the miRNA. Due to their single-stranded structure, they are easily degraded by nucleases. Chemical modification can be a good way to increase affinity for target miRNA, stabilize miRNA inhibitor to avoid nuclease degradation, prevent cleavage by RISC and promote tissue uptake for in vivo delivery.61 Barbara Robertson and her colleagues showed that the function of the inhibitors varies with the position of the mismatch in the inhibitors. The \u201cseed region\u201d (3rd\u20138th nucleotides) and the \u201c3\u2032 region\u201d (13th\u201318th nucleotides) are equally important in determining recognition of the inhibitor target by endogenous miRNAs.62 With the deep research on AMOs, they are widely used in miRNA loss-of-function study and miRNA suppression therapy. However, there are still many shortcomings that inhibit the development of this discovery. The inhibition still could not be sustainable and permanent; AMOs are toxic and can trigger innate immune response and finally cause cell death; the concentration of AMOs that used in transfection cannot exert satisfactory inhibition, whereas the higher concentration may cause cell death.63 The miRNA sponge is a designed RNA transcript that expressed from strong promotor and bind to target miRNA competitively via multiple and tandem miRNA binding sites.64 Different from AMOs, once miRNA sponges can be transfected and expressed stably in cells, they can play a prolonged even permanent role in suppressing individual miRNA or the whole family.63 miRNA sponges are also widely used in miRNA loss-of-function study and miRNA suppression therapy.",

Although the result is consistent with RNAi, the mechanism is indeed completely different. Based on mechanisms of action, ODN can be classified into two groups: one is the RNaseH-dependent oligonucleotides which result in the degradation of mRNA; the other is the steric-blocker oligonucleotides, which structurally suppress the progression of splicing or translation. RNaseH is an endoribonuclease which hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in RNA/DNA duplex, so it can target to any regions of the mRNA for inhibition. However, the most steric-blocker oligonucleotides are efficient only at 5\u2032- or AUG initiation codon region, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, it may not always be an optimal site for targeting.78 Furthermore, the siRNA appears to be more potent at very low concentrations (<50 nM) and more resistant in cell culture and in mice.79\n",

Using RNAi approach to improve nutritional values and grain yield in different crops is promising. Cui's team showed hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing of oleate desaturase can generate a high oleic peanut line. Nutrition level of peanut oil is conventionally qualified by the proportion of oleic and linoleic acids. Oleate desaturase (FAD2) gene is the negative regulator to high oleic acid production. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, FAD2 gene was successfully suppressed and a significant increase of oleic acid content was observed in transgenic peanut line.123 Similarly in wheat, Morell's group found starch-branching enzyme encoding genes SBEIIa and SBEIIb are related to the production of amylose content. They had successfully created a transgenic wheat line by using RNAi technique to regulate the expression of SBEIIa and SBEIIb. The transgenic wheat obtains a high level of amylose production and various health benefits.124 For the grain yield improvement, researchers had shown that RNAi-mediated transgenic rice line for qSW5 has an increased seed weight.125 Moreover, a semi-dwarf transgenic rice line generated by RNAi suppression of target GA 20-oxidase (OsGA20ox2) gene from original taller rice, has shown increased number of seeds per panicle and larger panicle size.126\n",

This modification offered a decent yield protection of canola under drought stress.127 In addition, similar effect was obtained in rice. Receptor of C-kinase 1 is the negative regulator of stomatal closure related to water loss. Liang's team has successfully created a transgenic rice line whose RACK1 gene was suppressed by RNAi.

Price and Gatehouse used in-planta produced dsRNAs as feeding component and successfully silenced different target genes in several pest species, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera.131 The experiment has demonstrated the potential of developing insect-resistant plant and crop lines. Nevertheless, different studies had identified western corn rootworm (WCR) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte is a special coleopteran specie which can ingest dsRNA diets and trigger robust RNAi activity within their bodies. Robert's group showed transgenic corn plants engineered to produce WCR dsRNAs could induce a significant reduction in WCR feeding damage in a growth chamber assay.132\nIn-planta expressed WCR dsRNA can successfully inhibit the growth of WCR and prevent the damage on transgenic corns. Another study has identified a cytochrome P450 gene (CYP6AE14) is highly correlated with the growth of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera). Larvae fed with plant diet modified to express specific dsRNA against CYP6AE14, showed a retarded growth.133 Followed the lead of these promising findings, further studies on how to control dsRNA transmission between host plant and insects, how to make feeding silencing effects inheritable etc. are emerging.",

RNAi signals transmit through host crop to parasites was examined as a potential method to control parasitic weeds. Yoder's group transformed an interfering hairpin RNA-targeted GUS gene into lettuce. Then they used hemi-parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor which expressed GUS reporter gene to parasitize the root of either transgenic or non-transgenic lettuce. After GUS staining, Triphysaria roots attached to transgenic lettuce showed respectfully lower GUS activity and transcript quantification confirmed a significant reduction in GUS mRNA level.134 This result suggested sequence specific silencing signal can be successfully transmitted through host plant to parasitic plant and induce further suppression of target genes within parasites. Following this idea, Radi and his colleagues investigated RNAi transitions between tomato and parasitic Orobanche.135\nOrobanche spp. (broomrape) are parasitic plants subsisted through the attachment to the root of host plant. They can cause severe damage to various crops, including tomato. During the growth of Orobanche, strong mannitol accumulation was observed and mannose 6-phosphate reductase (M6PR) is the essential enzyme related to mannitol synthesize activities. Radi's team produced a transgenic tomato line stable bearing M6PR-siRNAs against Orobanche aegyptiaca's M6PR-mRNA. The RT-PCR quantification showed the level of endogenous M6PR mRNA in Orobanche aegyptiaca grown on transgenic tomato was significantly reduced by 60%\u201380%.",

Takatsuji's group used RNAi method to silence OsSSI2, an essential gene responsible for desaturase activity of fatty acid.136 The genetically modified Arabidopsis and soybean they produced showed resistance to multiple pathogens infection. Yet a following study focused on the fatty acid gene family members, OsFAD7 and OsFAD8 was conducted.
