Infected pigs would consume more feed and require protracted production time to reach market weight. In our observational longitudinal study, growth performance data from 728 control pigs and 193 infected pigs with known viral shedding time points were analyzed using mixed linear regression models to give estimates of the marginal effects of infection. Gaussian curves describing the variability of the estimates at the individual pig level formed the fundamental inputs to our stochastic models. The models were constructed to simulate the summed negative effects of the infection at the batch level of 150 fattening pigs growing from 33 to 100 kg. Other inputs of variability and uncertainty were 1) batch transmission points, 2) pig infection points to reflect the disease transmission dynamics of the virus, and 3) final prevalence of infected pigs in the batch. Monte Carlo random sampling gave 5,000 estimates on the outputs of the marginal effects for each pig. These results were summed up to provide estimates for a batch size of 150 pigs. This figure was adjusted by our final prevalence distribution function, which was also derived from the longitudinal study with 12 cohorts of infected pigs. For a 150-fattening-pig herd randomly selected from the population, the marginal effects of the infection were 1) 835 kg (fifth percentile) to 1,350 kg (95th percentile) increased feed intake and 2) 194 (fifth percentile) to 334 (95th percentile) pig days in excess of expected figures for an uninfected batch. A batch infected during growth phase 3 (81 to 100 kg BW) gave the worst results since the longitudinal study showed that a pig infected during growth phase 3 required more feed and a greater protracted production time compared to younger infected pigs. Sensitivity analysis showed that final prevalence had the greatest impact on the conditional mean and variation of the marginal effects of infections. Batch transmission point was the next most influential factor. Lowering the final prevalence and preventing older fattening pigs from being infected will have the greatest benefit in saving feed cost and reducing delay in getting the pigs to the market. et al., 2012) . It was Norway's first influenza A virus infection in its pig population since the active national serosurveillance started in 1997 . A case control study (Grontvedt et al., 2013) revealed that the outbreak in pigs was likely caused by cross-species transmission from human to pigs. Although pH1N1v appeared highly contagious in na\u00efve pigs like other swine influenza viruses (SIV; Brookes et al., 2010; Er et al., 2014) , the virus appeared to be of low virulence since infection manifested itself mostly in the subclinical form in na\u00efve Norwegian pig herds (Grontvedt et al., 2011; Lium et al., 2014) . Despite the subclinical state, a longitudinal study at the Norwegian boar testing station showed that infected growing pigs had reduced feed efficiency because of a poorer feed conversion ratio. Consequently, infected pigs required additional feed and protracted production time compared to their uninfected counterparts. These findings, when considered at the batch level, are useful for economic analysis of a farm's profitability and for decision making with regard to disease control and biosecurity measures. However, to consider the sum total effects at the batch level, an understanding of factors that will vary the outcome is important for realistic estimations. It is therefore the aim of this paper to present a stochastic model for assessment of the production impact of pH1N1v infection in Norwegian pigs at the batch level. The stochastic model, based on a field observational study, will account for the variabilities and uncertainties that influence the individual impact of each pig for the summation at the batch level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 262, "text": "(Hofshagen et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 263, "end": 288, "text": "Torremorell et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 289, "end": 292, "text": "Van", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2711, "end": 2724, "text": "et al., 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2881, "end": 2905, "text": "(Grontvedt et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3128, "text": "Brookes et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3129, "end": 3145, "text": "Er et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3284, "end": 3308, "text": "(Grontvedt et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3309, "end": 3327, "text": "Lium et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The field study at the commercial boar testing station was purely observational.

Norway is a rare exception in that it has ongoing active national serological surveillance for influenza A virus infection in its population of unvaccinated pigs. In the last 5 yr from 2010 to 2014, Norway's herd prevalence for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has stabilized in the range of 41% to 50%, thus indicating that the infection has established itself in the pig population. Even though infection would confer long-term active immunity to a pig that recovered from infection, the quick turnover of fattening pigs whose lifespan is less than 7 mo ensures that large populations of immunologically na\u00efve pigs are constantly produced, making the continuous propagation of influenza infection possible (Van Reeth et al., 2012) . In addition, any maternal antibodies a fattening pig may have would decrease by the time the pig reaches 12 to 14 wk, or about 33 kg in BW (Loeffen et al., 2003) , making them susceptible to infection.
