A key protein family responsible for the regulated generation of reactive oxygen species in multiple cell types is the NOX/DUOX enzyme family. Two family members, DUOX1 and DUOX2, appear to be highly expressed in tissues of endodermal origin including the thyroid, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. In this chapter, we will focus our review on DUOX proteins in the respiratory tract. We will discuss a brief history of the discovery of the DUOX isoforms, the estimated hydrogen peroxide-generating capacity of DUOX in respiratory tract epithelium, putative functions of the DUOX enzymes, and some regulatory factors responsible for DUOX gene expression and oxidase activity.",

A key protein family responsible for the regulated generation of ROS in multiple cell types is the NOX/DUOX enzyme family (Lambeth, 2002) . The prototypical member of this family is gp91phox (NOX2), which is responsible for the respiratory burst in neutrophils (Gabig and Babior, 1979; Dusi et al., 1995; Hohn and Lehrer, 1975) . Suh et al. were the first to characterize NOX1 (initially named Mox1; for mitogenic oxidase) as a non-mitochondrial, non-phagocytic enzyme capable of regulated ROS production (Suh et al., 1999) . Since this discovery, there has been an exponentially growing body of literature characterizing the function of the non-phagocytic NOX/DUOX family members (NOX1, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2) in various aspects of human biology and disease (Lambeth, 2004; Leto and Geiszt, 2006) . In this chapter, we will focus our review on the expression and function of DUOX proteins in the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Initial identification of the DUOX2 was made by Corinne Dupuy and colleagues using biochemical techniques to isolate the known membrane-bound NADPH oxidase in thyroid tissues (Dupuy et al., 1999) . In this report, they described the isolation of a 1,210 amino acid protein, p138 Tox , which contained a gp91phox-like region and two EF-hand domains. EF-hand domains contain calcium binding sites and serve as regulatory sub units for enzymatic activity. The presence of EF-hand domains suggested that p138 Tox enzymatic activity may be regulated by calcium. Additionally, expression of p138 Tox was upregulated by forskolin and the gene localized to Chromosome 15q15. Shortly after this discovery, Xavier De Deken described the isolation of two human thyroid NADPH oxidases (De Deken et al., 2000) . These genes, thyroid oxidase 1 (ThOX1) and thyroid oxidase 2 (ThOX2), were identified by low stringency hybridization screening of thyroid cDNA libraries using a 1.3-kilobase fragment of gp91phox. Similar to Dupuy's findings, both ThOX1 and ThOX2 contained a gp91phox-like region and two EF-hand domains, and both genes were upregulated by forskolin. In addition, increased sequence information identified novel N-terminal extensions for both proteins that contained a peroxidase-like domain. The 1,210 amino acid C-terminal portion of ThOX2 was identical to p138 Tox , which strongly suggested that these two proteins were the same protein. Because both proteins express dual oxidases, a heme peroxidase domain and an NADPH oxidase domain, ThOX1 and ThOX2/p138 Tox have been renamed DUOX1 and DUOX2, respectively.",

Further characterization of DUOX in the lung demonstrated that DUOX expression is likely limited to the respiratory tract epithelium (Geiszt et al., 2003) . Although PCR evidence exists that several NOX family members are potentially expressed in the respiratory tract, expression levels of the other Nox family members are a thousand-fold less abundant compared to DUOX (Schwarzer et al., 2004) . Based on in situ hybridization experiments, it appears that DUOX1 is predominantly located in proximal respiratory tract epithelial cells whereas DUOX2 is localized to submandibular or salivary glands during basal conditions (Schwarzer et al., 2004) . However, protein confirmation of these findings has been limited due to the absence of DUOX isoform-specific antibodies.",

            "text": "The capacity for respiratory tract epithelium to generate H 2 O 2 appears to be dependent upon the specific cell type utilized. For example, in unstimulated human primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells, the rate of H 2 O 2 production was 0.5-2.5 nmol/10 min/10 6 cells and this production increases to 2-5 nmol/10 min/10 6 cells after stimulation with ATP (Moskwa et al., 2007) . In HBE1 cells, a papillomatransformed human tracheobronchial epithelial cell line (Yankaskas et al., 1993) . H 2 O 2 production was 0.03-0.17 nmol/10 min/10 6 cells and this production increases to 0.26-0.45 nmol/10 min/10 6 cells after stimulation with ATP (Wesley et al., 2007) . In a human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, H 2 O 2 production increased from 0.002-0.003 nmol/10 min/10 6 cells to 0.012-0.014 nmol/10 min/10 6 cells after PMA stimulation (Nakanaga et al., 2007) . Although laboratory to laboratory variation may account for these differences, it appears that primary respiratory tract epithelial cells have the highest capacity for DUOX-mediated H 2 O 2 generation. In parallel, we have observed that DUOX1 or DUOX2 mRNA expression and functional activity is higher in primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells compared to HBE1 cells (Xu and Haper, 2007) .",

The upper respiratory tract epithelium and conducting airways are structured to provide multiple layers of protection against invading organisms. This includes a tight epithelial barrier where the apical surface of the respiratory tract is in close apposition to prevent invasion. This apical surface is bathed in an airway surface liquid that is rich in antimicrobial peptides hostile to bacterial and viral products. Resting on top of this airway surface liquid is a mucous layer that provides a physical barrier against infection. Mucus that has ensnared bacteria and virus particles is cleared from the airway by ciliary action provided by the respiratory tract epithelial cells. The generation of hypothiocyanate in the airway surface liquid appears to be a critical part of the host defense for those bacteria and viral particles that are able to penetrate the initial mucociliary barrier (Goldman and Smith, 1973; Ratner and Prince, 2000) .",

This transport appears to be the rate-limiting step in the respiratory tract and is dependent upon the presence of functional CFTR chloride channels. The rate of SCN-transport (1.5-1.8 nmol/10 min/cm 2 ) (Conner et al., 2007) parallels the rate of OSCN-formation (1.4-1.7 nmol/10 min/cm 2 ) (Moskwa et al., 2007) in respiratory tract epithelium. This is consistent with the notion that SCN \u2212 is immediately converted to OSCN \u2212 once SCN \u2212 is transported to the apical surface. However, two different model systems, rat versus human, were used in these reports, which limits our ability to directly compare the two studies. Of importance, LPO, DUOX-mediated H 2 O 2 , and apical SCN \u2212 are all required for bacterial killing of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa (Moskwa et al., 2007) . The capacity of DUOX isoforms to generate H 2 O 2 in respiratory tract epithelium (5 nmol/10 min/cm 2 ) is more than adequate to support this model.",

The observation that DUOX2 expression is substantially increased by IFN-\u03b3 and rhinovirus provides circumstantial evidence for this notion (Harper et al., 2005) . In addition, respiratory tract epithelial cells are known to generate H 2 O 2 in less than 1h after RV infection (Kaul et al., 2000; Biagioli et al., 1999) . RV-induced H 2 O 2 production is inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), which indicates the involvement of a flavoprotein, likely an NADPH oxidase, in this process. Therefore, DUOX appears to be the best candidate responsible for RV-induced H 2 O 2 production in respiratory tract epithelium. The presence of EF-hand domains on DUOX isoforms suggests a mechanism by which RV infection can immediately induce DUOX-mediated H 2 O 2 production (e.g. membrane-associated calcium flux (Geiszt et al., 2003; Forteza et al., 2005) .

            "text": "Alternative functions for DUOX isozymes in the respiratory tract have recently been suggested. Hydrogen ion concentration at the apical surface of respiratory tract epithelium serves important host defense functions. Not only does lower pH increase the efficiency of known respiratory tract peroxidases such as LPO, but an acidic environment is known to decrease viability of some respiratory viruses (Greenberg, 2007; Whitton et al., 2005; Hayden, 2004) . Therefore, an attractive model for DUOX is the ability of this protein to simultaneously acidify the airway surface liquid to optimize LPO enzymatic activity and provide the H 2 O 2 needed for LPO to convert SCN \u2212 to OSCN \u2212 . Recent data from Horst Fischer and colleagues support the role of DUOX in H + production and H + secretion. By using chemical inhibitors of DUOX (Schwarzer et al., 2004) and DUOX1-specific RNAi transcripts, they were able to demonstrate an approximately 50% reduction in intracellular acid production. These data suggest that under basal conditions there is DUOX-mediated turnover of NADPH to NADP + that is responsible for approximately 50% of H + production. Based on this model, it is presumed that activation of NADPH oxidase activity in the respiratory tract, and specifically activation of DUOX1, will result in a parallel increase in H + secretion. However, this presumption has not been formally tested. Similarly, it is not known if increased activation of DUOX2 will result in a similar increase in intracellular H + production or H + secretion. DUOX1 appears to perform a specific role in signaling events related to mucin secretion and wound healing. Wesley et al. recently demonstrated that ATP-mediated P2 purinergic receptor activation was necessary for cell migration and wound closure in primary and virus-immortalized tracheobronchial epithelial cell cultures (Wesley et al., 2007) . This functional activity correlated with increased DUOX1dependent H 2 O 2 production. Wound closure was significantly decreased in cells expressing siRNA against DUOX1, but not in cells expressing non-target siRNA transcripts. Together, these data strongly suggested that DUOX1-generated H 2 O 2 is a necessary signal for adequate wound closure in human tracheobronchial epithelium. Although not explicitly tested, it is likely that release of intracellular ATP during injury induces purinergic receptor-mediated calcium flux, which directly triggers DUOX1 oxidase activity via EF-hand domain activation. Similarly, Shao et al. demonstrated that DUOX1 appears to be a critical protein necessary for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-or human neutrophil elastase-mediated MUC5AC production in human tracheobronchial epithelial cell cultures (Shao and Nadel, 2005) .",

DUOX1 increased in response to the Th2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). DUOX2 mRNA expression increased significantly in response to the Th1 cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and increased modestly to interleukin-1a or interleukin-1b. Of potential importance, the nature of gene expression was significantly different between the two genes in response to their respective cytokines. DUOX1, for example, increased maximally three-to sixfold in response to IL-4 at varying doses of the cytokine. In comparison, DUOX2 increased linearly with increasing doses of IFN-\u03b3 more than 15-to 20-fold. Although the fold-induction was substantially higher for DUOX2 compared to DUOX1, DUOX2 expression levels began to wane after 48 h. However, DUOX1 levels continued to increase 72 h after cytokine treatment. These qualitative differences in regulation and the differential regulation of DUOX1 and DUOX2 by cytokines suggest both enzymes perform distinct functions in the respiratory tract epithelium. Localization of DUOX1 and DUOX2 protein in the respiratory tract epithelium, and identifying proteins that colocalized with the DUOX isoforms will be instrumental in determining the functions of each protein.",

Based on mRNA data, DUOX1 is the predominant isoform expressed under basal conditions in airway cell cultures. Therefore, it is likely that DUOX1 provides the majority of DUOX-mediated H 2 O 2 under basal conditions. Cytokine treatments that increase DUOX mRNA levels, and presumably DUOX protein levels, induce a parallel increase in H 2 O 2 production (Harper et al., 2005) . This suggests that one method to regulate DUOX oxidase activity is to regulate the absolute level of protein in respiratory tract epithelium. Based on our previous data, it appears that maximal inducible expression of DUOX1 or DUOX2 result in similar levels of H 2 O 2 generation in respiratory tract epithelium (Harper et al., 2005) . Although DUOX2 is more inducible by cytokine stimulation compared to DUOX1, it is possible that the protein levels of DUOX2 or DUOX1 are similar when maximally induced by their respective cytokines.

Shao et al. demonstrated that p47phox and p67phox proteins were identified in the membrane fraction of respiratory tract epithelial cells after PMA treatment. This localization corresponded to PMA-induced, DUOX1-mediated H 2 O 2 production (Shao and Nadel, 2005) . However, family members that are more closely related to NOX2 do not use these phox regulatory units for enzymatic activity (Banfi et al., 2003) . There is direct evidence in thyroid tissues that cytosolic phox regulators, including Rac, do not provide regulatory functions for DUOX. And, patients with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease, in which there are defects in cytosolic phox regulators, do not exhibit hypothyroidism. Together, these latter data suggest that the DUOX isozymes do not rely on these cytosolic phox regulatory units. However, differences in the predominant isoform found in thyroid tissue (DUOX2) versus respiratory tract epithelium (DUOX1) may be responsible for these contradictory data. Further studies with knock down of various phox regulatory units in respiratory tract epithelium will be able to definitively settle this issue.",

This question can be partially addressed by the observation that DUOX1 and DUOX2 are differentially regulated in respiratory tract epithelium. Although H 2 O 2 is produced by both DUOX proteins, it is possible that the functional signalasomes that assemble around DUOX1 are substantially different from the proteins that cluster around DUOX2.

Evidence that DUOX isozymes are important for mucin secretion, proton secretion, and wound healing strongly supports the notion that these family members are critical for multiple functions in the respiratory tract. Regulation of DUOX enzymatic activity by calcium flux and regulation of protein expression by immune-modulating cytokines provide insights into additional potential functions for these family members.
