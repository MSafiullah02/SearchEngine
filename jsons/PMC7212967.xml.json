COVID-19 viral RNA has been detected in the stool of a patient in the USA [14] and it is possible COVID-19 could be transmitted via fecal\u2013oral route, through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor [15]. Although our patient was COVID-19 positive, adjacent bowel tissue of our patient appeared histologically unaffected with the exception of scattered lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration (Fig. 4\n). However, strict precautions such as minimal bowel exposure, bowel decompression and proper fecal disinfection were taken during the surgery to prevent viral dissemination to surgical staff.

Ideally, testing of all staff involved in patient care would allow for optimal minimization of viral transmission. However, lack of testing reagents and test kits worldwide limit this approach. Alternatively, due to availability screening chest CT was utilized among surgical staff per CCDC recommendations at that time. American College of Radiology guidelines as of March 11,2020 have recommended against this approach due to radiologic exposure and lack of sensitivity. Further studies are needed to identify if the guidelines regarding COVID-19 screening are applicable to surgical staff in high risk aerosolizing environments such as operating suites.",

Although fecal COVID-19 RNA has been detected, surgical pathology did not note COVID-19 in adjacent bowel tissue, but this finding has unclear clinical implications at this time. Regardless, all surgical tissue and surgical waste removed in both large and small bowel surgeries will likely have fecal contamination and should be treated as a potential infectious source of COVID-19 and disposed of accordingly. Finally, further investigation is needed into post-operative management of COVID-19 patients, medical management of COVID-19 and appropriate screening for surgical staff involved in operating on COVID-19 patients.",
