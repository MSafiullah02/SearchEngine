Normal routines, occupations, and even the easy availability of food and other essentials, have been interrupted. Mental health services are changing \u2013 day centres closing, routine appointments either being cancelled, put-off, or conducted remotely.

Current testing methods are understood to have a non-negligible false-negative rate (West, Montori, & Sampathkumar, 2020), and so may be falsely reassuring that patients don't have COVID-19 when in fact they do. We want to emphasise in light of this, that it may be justifiable for infection control policies to necessitate a set period of time for isolation on the basis of clinical judgment even in case of a negative test result. This would have the effect that review of the need for isolation could only meaningfully happen on a relatively infrequent basis,4\ne.g. initially after seven or fourteen days. Infection control policies should allow for the least possible restriction on individual liberty that adequately mitigates risk \u2013 though the science and ethics of this balancing exercise fall outside the scope of this paper. However, if these policies allowed scope to terminate seclusion early on the basis of test results and clinical presentation, this would underline the importance of regular review of those subject to isolation, as well as the availability of viral testing for mental health patients.",

So long as they do not live in a similarly shared environment (e.g. a care home), this option is likely to mitigate overall transmission risk, and will certainly reduce the risk of transmission within the mental health unit. This would limit the availability of usual ward provisions (e.g. occupational therapy) to them.\u2022Cohorting. The patient could be moved to a ward or ward area which is designated only for those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. This strategy is part of national infection control advice for care homes (Department of Health, and Social Care, Public Health England, Care Quality Commission, NHS, 2020) and hospitals (PHE, 2020), and would apply similarly to mental health units. Ward activities would in theory be able to proceed fairly normally in a cohorted environment \u2013 though staff (specially allocated to the unit) would be wearing appropriate protective equipment, and there would likely be additional restrictions on visitors to / leave from the unit.\u2022Isolating the patient in their rooms. In practice this might take many different forms. If the patient is violent or aggressive, they may need a specially built room (see section 2.2.3) \u2013 however most would be able to stay in their bedrooms, which may or may not have an en-suite bathroom. If there is no en-suite they would need to leave their room to use a facility designated for their use only. Food and drink would be brought to them by a member of staff. If the patient were unable to comply with isolation (e.g. constantly wandering out), it may be necessary to have a member of staff outside their room at all times to remind them to stay in the room and prevent them leaving, or it might be necessary to lock their door. In any case it would be important that isolated patients were able to contact staff quickly in order that their needs were met \u2013 and in some cases this in itself might necessitate a dedicated staff member being nearby at all times. Many usual ward provisions would not be possible in isolation (e.g. sports, group sessions, communal mealtimes) \u2013 though some would be, even if in an adapted form (e.g. medication, medical assessment, psychotherapy via video-call).\n",

It is legitimate only in the very short term, and so could not be relied upon for the periods of time required for respiratory isolation. Furthermore, the isolation of patients in psychiatric hospitals due to COVID-19 may become widespread practice, and providers would be expected to apply existing frameworks or develop appropriate other policy in order to adequately safeguard ongoing restrictions on people's right to liberty. Especially when viewed through the prism of the ECHR, the courts would be likely \u2013 rightly \u2013 to take a very dim view upon reliance upon a residual common law defence to justify isolation, carrying with it as it does no clear procedural guarantees to ensure that it is not used arbitrarily.11\n",

These provide restrictions on people leaving their main residence without a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019, making it an offence to do so. This is enforced primarily by police, and can be punishable by a fine. Reasonable excuses include taking exercise, obtaining basic necessities, like food, and seeking medical help. It is unlikely that these restrictions apply to bedrooms in mental health inpatient units, and even if they did, that they would or could (practically) be enforced by the police. The police seem to be considering inpatient units as a \u201chousehold\u201d, in which case the regulations would not apply (personal correspondence). The principle of these Regulations may apply to leave from hospital, but do not clearly apply to the issue of isolation within wards. As such, we suggest that the CA 2020 is the relevant public health legislation.",

The ECtHR found that the periods of seclusion that Colonel Munjaz was subject to (which were as long as 21 days at a time) did not cross the line. It placed weight upon four factors41\n: (1) that he was already in a high security hospital; (2) that the seclusion was not imposed as a punishment but was such as to contain severely disturbed behaviour which is likely to cause harm to others42\n; (3) the length of his seclusion each time was a matter of clinical judgment; and (4) (the factor upon which the court placed the greatest weight) the seclusion was implemented in as liberal a fashion as possible.",

For some patients it may be possible to eventually transfer them directly to the community from isolation (e.g. discharge or on leave), though it is unlikely to be useful to make this assessment more than once daily.\u2022Harm to others is not mediated by physical violence, and it is unlikely that the patient requires the physical security of a dedicated seclusion room.\u2022Infection risk to staff in a hospital setting would be a compelling reason to undertake some reviews using telepresence rather than in-person.\u2022It is likely that procedural safeguards are needed for patients who comply with isolation but lack the capacity to make this decision.\u2022It is likely that procedural safeguards are needed for patients who \u2018voluntarily\u2019 self-isolate, even those who are detained under the MHA 1983, given how easily it could be argued that their consent was invalid.

Most psychiatric interventions are given with the dual aim of treating underlying mental disorder, as well as reducing the associated harm.

Seclusion in this instance is not because of COVID-19, rather because there is a cogent link between disturbed behaviour (inability to self-isolate being a product of mental disorder) and a risk to others (mediated by a dangerous virus). Indeed, it is often the case that factors entirely independent of a patient's mental disorder are relevant to a decision regarding seclusion. A very large and strong individual is far more likely to require seclusion in order to manage the same degree of behavioural disturbance as someone who lacks that physical presence. Needless to say, having an imposing stature is neither a symptom of mental disorder nor something we aim to \u2018treat\u2019 in psychiatry \u2013 yet it is relevant to risk of harm to others, and so also to a decision to seclude. Fundamentally, a risk of \u2018harm to others\u2019 necessarily relates to factors extrinsic to the individual's mental disorder.
