Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.",

In the gut Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are predominant while Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria preponderate in the lung (Zhang et al., 2020) . Interestingly, the gut microbiota has been shown to affect pulmonary health through a vital cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the lungs which is referred to as the \"gut-lung axis\" (Keely, Talley and Hansbro, 2012) . The gut-lung axis is supposed to be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f bidirectional, meaning the endotoxins, microbial metabolites can impact the lung through blood and when inflammation occurs in the lung, it can affect the gut microbiota as well (Dumas et al., 2018) . This raises an interesting possibility that novel SARS-Cov2 might also have an impact on the gut microbiota. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that respiratory infections are associated with a change in the composition of the gut microbiota (Groves et al., 2020) . One of the serious clinical manifestations of Covid-19 is pneumonia and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) especially in elderly, immune-compromised patients (Lake, 2020) . Numerous experimental and clinical observations have suggested that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and ARDS (Dickson and Arbor, 2017). Loss of gut bacteria diversity can lead to dysbiosis which may then be associated with many diseases (Mosca, Leclerc and Hugot, 2016) . In fact, elderly people have less diverse gut microbiota and beneficial microorganisms like bifidobacterium lose ground (Nagpal et al., 2018) . Since, many elderly and immune-compromised patients progress to serious adverse clinical outcomes, it is therefore tempting to speculate that in Covid-19, there is a possible cross-talk taking place between the lung and the gut microbiota which might influence the outcome of the clinical manifestation.",

The gut microbiota are supposed to significantly regulate the development and function of the innate and adaptive immune system (Negi, Das, et al., 2019) . Intestinal commensals secrete antimicrobial peptides, compete for the nutrients and the habitat site thereby aiding in the state of homeostasis (Moens and Veldhoen, 2012) . The gut microbiota and immune homeostasis seem to have a back and forth relationship and is also a field of great interest and intense research investigation in the field of infectious diseases. Also, gut microbiota derived signals are known to tune the immune cells for pro and anti-inflammatory responses thereby affecting J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the susceptibility to various diseases (Negi, Pahari, et al., 2019) . The immune gut homeostasis is orchestrated by the fine tuning of the regulatory balance of pro-inflammatory responses such as Th17 versus inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) that is ultimately controlled by the commensal microorganisms (Round and Mazmanian, 2010) . In circumventing a response to pathogenic infections like coronavirus, a healthy gut microbiome essentially could be pivotal in maintaining an optimal immune system to prevent an array of excessive immune reactions that eventually become detrimental to lungs and vital organ systems. In such circumstances, it becomes imperative to have a balanced immune response wherein an over reactive one or an under reactive one can equally be consequential to aggravate clinical complications like pneumonia and ARDS in a viral disease like Covid-19 (Figure 1) .",

            "text": "Microorganisms serve as a source of microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The two are recognizable on the host's cells through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding receptors (NODs) (Ivanov and Honda, 2012) . TLRs recognize the MAMPS and PAMPs among other molecules and evoke different immunological reactions depending on the type of cell, ligand or receptor. Training of PRRs expressing innate cells with gut microbial/non-microbial ligands is needed as a protective mechanism independent of adaptive immunity during secondary infection/pathogenic exposures. Importantly, the gut microbiota secreted metabolites and immunomodulatory signals that comprise the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) like the butyrate, acetate and propionate and secondary bile acids secreted by commensals like bacteroides, lactobacillus, and bifidobacteria bind to their receptors in innate cells such as DCs and macrophages thereby modulating their metabolism and functions (Rooks and Garrett, 2016; Jia, Xie and Jia, 2018) . In fact, introduction of probiotic strains such as Bifidobacterium lactis into healthy elderly volunteers resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of mononuclear leukocytes, and the tumoricidal activity of NK cells (Gill et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2001). The composition of balanced gut microbiota is known to have a major influence on the effectiveness of lung immunity (Bingula et al., 2017) . Germ free mice (GF mice), devoid of their intestinal microbiota have been shown to have impaired pathogen clearance capability in the lung (Fagundes et al., 2012) . Disruption of gut microbiota with widespread antibiotic use can also have similar effect as was observed in population studies showing that increased use of penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, and quinolones correlated with an increased risk of lung cancer in humans (Boursi et al., 2015) . Interestingly, influenza viral infection in the respiratory tract in mice increases Enterobacteriaceae as well reduces Lactobacilli and Lactococci in the intestinal microbiota (Looft and Allen, 2012) . Taken together, it can be suggested that since the gut microbiota play such an important role in immunity, infection caused by SARS-Cov2 need to be properly studied with respect to the role played by the intestinal and lung commensal microorganisms.",

It is interesting to note that the gut microbiota of animals fed with a high fat or high sugar diet are more prone to circadian rhythm disruption (Voigt et al., 2014) .

            "text": "Encouragingly, various components of food have been shown to have differential effects on the gut microbiota. For instance, the consumption of the protein extracts of whey and pea increases gut-commensal bacteria bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, while whey is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f additionally shown to decrease the pathogenic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens (Dominika et al., 2011) . Similarly, it was noted that consumption of a low-fat diet led to increased faecal abundance of bifidobacterium. On the other hand, a high saturated fat diet increased the relative proportion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Singh et al., 2017) . In contrast to the digestible carbohydrates, non-digestible carbohydrates such as fibre and resistant starch are known to undergo fermentation by the resident microorganisms in the intestine (De Filippis et al., 2016) . Dietary fibres are good source of microbiota accessible carbohydrates which provide the host with energy and improves intestinal health. Prebiotics have been studied in the context of modification of the human gut microbiota. Prebiotic compounds such as inulin, polydextrose, maize fibre have been shown to improve the immunity, gut diversity, digestion etc. in humans and especially in elderly people (Kleessen et al., 1997; Bouhnik et al., 2007) . In addition to the effects on the composition of the microbiota, prebiotics also produce notable shifts in immune and metabolic markers. Example, it was observed that consumption of non-digestible carbohydrates present in whole grains led to reductions in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and insulin resistance (Keim and Martin, 2014) . Similarly, increased plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL10, was observed with the intake of butyrylated high amylose maize starch (West et al., 2013) . It is to be noted that beneficial effects of the prebiotics are thought to be mediated mostly by increased production of SCFAs and strengthening of the gastro-intestinal associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (Schley and Field C.J.*, 2002) . Thought-provoking results have shown that a fibre rich diet changes not only the intestinal microbiota, but can also affect the lung microbiota, indicating influence of nutrition on lung immunity (Trompette et al., 2014) . Like prebiotics, role of probiotics which is generally defined as \"live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\" have been shown to have profound effect on health of the host. In the intestine the probiotics mainly refer to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and include many different strains such as L.",

Fascinatingly, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have been used successfully for the prophylactic prevention of traveller's diarrhoea (McFarland, 2007) . Probiotics have shown good results in improving inflammatory conditions as well as regulating innate immunity using toll-like receptors and the corresponding signalling pathways (West et al., 2017) .

            "text": "Covid-19 has pushed the world to the brink. The faster we understand this disease the better we will be prepared the next time. Research in gut microbiota has propelled our knowledge in the field of chronic and infectious diseases. Presence of SARS Cov2 RNA in the stool of some patients and diarrhoea in few suggest a subtle link between the lung and the intestine. Although, no faecal-oral transmission is reported, yet it can be assumed that many asymptomatic children and adults may shed infectious virus particles in the stool leading to infection in others. Gut microbiota diversity and the presence of beneficial microorganisms in the gut may play an important role in determining the course of this disease. Elderly, immune-compromised patients and patients with other co-morbidities like type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disorders J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fare poorly in combating Covid-19. It is interesting to note that a general imbalance of gut microbiota called \"dysbiosis\" is implicated in such patients and the elderly. Interestingly, it is known that in murine models, removal of certain gut bacteria by antibiotic leads to increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in lungs (Looft and Allen, 2012) . Also, several bacterial metabolites and bacterial fragments can modulate lung immune response (Trompette et al., 2014) . So, it is quite a possibility that gut dysbiosis may be influencing the clinical manifestation in Covid-19 as well. Microbial action on dietary fibre is known to increase short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in blood thereby protecting against allergic inflammation in the lungs (Trompette et al., 2014) . In fact, prebiotics such as wheat bran and fructooligosachharides (Fos), galactosachharides (Gos) are known to increase butyrate levels thereby reducing inflammation and improving conditions in asthma and cystic fibrosis(Anand and Mande, 2018). Similarly, many probiotics have been shown to improve or alleviate lung disease conditions. These probiotics show the effect by modulating the immune system. Mice model studies have shown that introduction of probiotic bacteria like Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium breve can down regulate allergic response (Feleszko et al., 2007) . Likewise, administration of Lactobacillus casei Shirota or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in cystic fibrosis patients leads to improvement in their conditions (West et al., 2017) . Since, gut microbiota is malleable and is modulated by diet, it is imperative that personalized diet strategies may be implemented as a supplement to current routine therapies. This can be done by profiling gut microbiota of the individual patients and recommending effective diet including specialized pre/probiotics such as FOS, GOS and various lactobacilli strains to improve gut dysbiosis and thereby improving overall immune response in such patients. This may improve and fasten recovery in patients especially the elderly and the immune-compromised who are infected with SARS-Cov2 virus (Figure 2) .",

Thus, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f effective nutritional strategy and specific functional foods aiming at the microbiota for specific population group may be the need of the hour. Research may be conducted to look at the effect of Covid-19 on the gut microbiota profile and vice versa. Secondly, it would be interesting to dissect the role of not only bacteria but other microorganisms such as fungi and phages that form a very niche ecosystem in the intestine in Covid-19. Finally, role of the lung microbiota may also be investigated. Insights from such studies will add new dimensions to understand infectious diseases and can help in taking decisive actions in future.",
