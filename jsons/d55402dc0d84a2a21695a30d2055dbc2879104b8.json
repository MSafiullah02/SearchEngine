            "text": "Deterministic models are important decision tools that can be useful to forecasting different scenarios. The first motivation of studying such models is based on the use of the theory of ordinary/partial differential equations and a low computational complexity which can permit a better calibration of the model characteristics. Furthermore, deterministic approached are the only suitable methods that can be used when modeling a new problem with few data. For more details, we refer the readers to [2, 30, 11, 49] and references therein. The use of the mathematical models as a predictive tool in the simulation of complex problems arising in a broad range of practical applications in biology, environmental fluid mechanic, chemistry and applied mathematics (for example: mathematical model in population biology and epidemiology, mixed Stokes-Darcy model, Navier-Stokes equations, nonlinear time-dependent reaction-diffusion problem, heat conduction equation and unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction equations) represents a good candidate for developing efficient numerical schemes in the approximate solutions of such problems [40, 34, 9, 10, 39, 38, 36, 14, 15, 32, 41, 28, 21, 43, 45, 53] . For parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) which present strong steep gradients (for instance: shallow water flow and advection-diffusion equations), numerical algorithms are needed with good resolution of steep gradients [12, 8, 20, 22, 31, 44, 27, 29] .",

Simpler models may provide less valid predictions since they cannot capture complex and unobserved human mixing patterns and other time-varying parameters of infectious disease spread. Also, complex models may be no more reliable than simpler ones if they miss key aspects of the biological entities (either ions, molecules, proteins or ceils) [1] . At a time when numbers of cases and deaths from coronavirus 2019 pandemic continue to increase with alarming speed, accurate forecasts from mathematical models are increasingly important for physicians, politicians, epidemiologists, the public and most importantly, for authorities responsible of organizing care for the populations they serve. Given the unpredictable behavior of severe acute respiratory syndrome Covid-19, it is worth mentioning that efficient numerical approached are the best tools that can be used to predict the spread of the disease with reasonable accuracy. These predictions have crucial consequences regarding how quickly and strongly the government of a country mores to curb a pandemic. However, assuming the worst-case scenario at state and national levels will lead to inefficiencies (such as: the competition for beds and supplies) and may compromise effective delivery and quality of care, whereas supposing the best-case scenario can conduct to disastrous underpreparation.",

Up today, no drug to treat the Covid-19 disease is officially available (approved by the World Health Organization (WHO)) and a vaccine will not be available for several months at the earliest. The only approaches widely used to slow the spread of the pandemic are those of classical epidemic control such as: physical distancing, contact tracing, hygiene measure, quarantine and case of isolation. However, the primary and most effective use of the epidemiologic models is to estimate the relative effect of various interventions in reducing disease burden rather than to produce precise quantitative predictions about extent on duration of disease burdens. Nevertheless, consumers of such models including the media, the publics and politicians sometimes focus on the quantitative predictions of infectious and mortality estimates. Such measures of potential disease burden are also necessary for planners who consider future outcomes in light of health care capacity. The big challenge consists to assess such estimates.",

Specifically, the proposed technique should provide the numbers of detected infected and undetected infected cases, numbers of deaths and needs of beds in hospitals in countries (for example, in Cameroon) where Covid-19 is a very serious health problem. It is Worth noticing that the model of Covid-19 considered in this work has been obtained under the asumption of \"only within-country disease spread\" for territories with relevant number of people infected by SARS-Cov-2, where local transmission is the major cause of the disease spread (for instance: case of Cameroon). Furthermore, the parameters of the model used in this note are taken from the literature [24, 25, 19] . Our study also relates the disease fatality rate with the percentage of detected cases over the real total infected cases which allows to analyze the importance of this percentage on the impact of Covid-19. In addition, to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the new approach when applied to the mathematical problem of coronavirus 2019 epidemic, we consider the case of Cameroon, the country of the central Africa where one can observe the highest number of people infected by the new virus SARS-Cov-2. We compare the results produced by the numerical method to the data obtained from this country and those provided by the World Health Organization in its reports [46] . Finally, it important to mention that the considered area (Cameroon) in the numerical experiments can be replaced by any territory worldwide. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 considers some preliminaries together with the mathematical formulation of Covid-19 spreading. In section 3, we provide a full description of the two-level second-order explicit scheme for solving the problem indicated in 2. Section 4 analyzes the stability and the convergence rate of the new procedure while a large set of numerical experiments are presented and critically discussed in Section 5. We draw in section 6 the general conclusion and we provided our future investigations.",

We assume that transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is contagious from person to person and not point source. Furthermore, it is also assumed that, at the initial phase of Covid-19 disease, the proportion of the population with immunity to SARS is negligible [3, 16, 4, 48] . At the beginning of a contagious epidemic, a small number of infected people start passing the disease to a large population. Individuals can go through nine states. They start out susceptible (X 1 : the person is not infected by the disease pathogen), exposed (X 2 : the person is in the incubation period after being infected by the disease pathogen, but has no clinical signs), infected (X 3 : the person has finished the incubation period,  may infected other people and start developing the clinical signs. Here, people can be taken in charge by  sanitary authorities of this country (hospitalized persons) or not detected by the authorities and continue as  infectious) , infectious by undetected (X 4 : the person can still infect other individuals, have clinical signs, but is not detected and reported by the authorities (these people will not die)), hospitalized or in quarantine at home (X 5 : the person is in hospital or in quarantine at home, can still infect other people, but will recover), hospitalized but will die (X 6 : the person is hospitalized and can infect other people, but will die), recovered after being previously infectious but undetected (X 7 : the person was not previously detected as infectious, survived the disease, is no longer infectious and has developed a natural immunity to the disease), recovered after being previously detected as infectious (X 8 : the person survived the disease, is no longer infectious and has developed a natural immunity to the virus, but she/he remains in hospital for a convalescence period d 0 days), dead by SARS-Cov-2 (X 9 ).",

The analysis has shown that the new algorithm is stable, at least secondorder accuracy and can serve as a fast and robust tool for integrating general systems of ordinary differential equations. Numerical results based on the case of Cameroon reproduce quite accurately the evolution of the number of cases (detected or undetected), number of deaths, number of people in hospitals, number of infected detected persons who recovered and number of infected undetected individuals who recovered by natural immunity from 06 March 2020 to 30 April 2020. The approach presented in this work can help to estimate the number of beds in hospitals during a pandemic. Furthermore, the proposed technique can be considered as a fundamental tool for detecting early a reasonable expected date of the peak during an epidemic. Our future works will consider the numerical solution of a more complex system of ordinary differential equations using the new two-level explicit approach.",

In particular, for \u03b8 = 0.3212 the predicted values on 30 April 2020 of cases, deaths and people in hospital are approximately 2205.6, 111.2786 and 19.6962, respectively, while these values become overestimated: 3260.6 cases, 166.1457 deaths and 90.1832 hospitalized people when \u03b8 = w = 0.0667 (the smallest value taken by \u03b8 in [w, 1]). Furthermore, for various values of the parameter we observe that the maximum number of undetected cases: 116.0502 people (for \u03b8 = 0.0667), 85.1727 people (for \u03b8 = 0.1515), 74.3269 people (for \u03b8 = 0.3212) and 56.5865 people (for \u03b8 = 0.7455) estimated by the new approach represent: 5.5% (for \u03b8 = 0.0667), 4.2257% (for \u03b8 = 0.1515), 4.0439% (for \u03b8 = 0.3212) and 3.6912% (for \u03b8 = 0.7455) of the number of total cases obtained on 30 March 2020.",
