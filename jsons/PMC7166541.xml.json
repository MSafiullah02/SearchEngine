The common carp was introduced to Mexico from Asia in 1889 (Wakida\u2010Kusunoki & Amador\u2010del\u2010\u00c1ngel, 2011) and is now distributed across the country, with the purpose of providing animal protein to rural populations and additional work opportunities to the community (Wakida\u2010Kusunoki & Amador\u2010del\u2010\u00c1ngel, 2011).

Primary among these diseases is the spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV), a notifiable pathogen according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE, 2017a) and a virus responsible for mortalities associated with acute haemorrhaging. To date, SVCV has been reported in common carp and other freshwater cyprinids in Asia and Europe, while detection on the American continent has been reported in the United States, Canada (Ahne et al., 2002; Ashraf et al., 2016; Garver et al., 2007; Goodwin, 2011) and Brazil (Alexandrino, Ranzani\u2010Paiva, & Romano, 1998; OIE, 2017a).

The present study describes a case of septicaemic disease in wild common carp obtained from a lagoon without tributaries or effluents in central Mexico.

To explore this possibility, the diagnostic procedures suggested by the OIE (2017b) for virus isolation were followed, with kidney and spleen samples collected from fish with haemorrhagic injuries and internal adhesions. Portions of these tissues were pooled in two 15\u2010ml Falcon tubes containing 9 ml of Leibovitz's L\u201015 Medium (Gibco BRL), coded as Carp\u20101 (composed with kidney and spleen samples collected from two fish specimens) and Carp\u20102 (composed with three other fish).

Each sample was diluted to 1:10 and 1:100 and inoculated, in duplicate, at a \u226590% confluence in 12\u2010well multiwall plates containing cell monolayers of Epithelioma Papulosum Cyprini (EPC) and bluegill fry (Lepomis macrochirus, BF\u20102), which were respectively incubated at 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. The inoculated cells were examined daily under an inverted Axiovert 40 C/40 CFL, ZEISS\u00ae microscope to establish the presence of the cytopathic effect (CPE).

Negative controls consisted of duplicate sets of wells containing monolayers of the respective cell lines. These monolayers were inoculated with 0.1 ml of filter\u2010sterilized (0.45 \u00b5m pore diameter) Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution.

This hypothesis was confirmed via electron microscopy, which revealed an abundance of characteristic bullet\u2010shaped viral particles with structural traits typical of rhabdovirus (110\u2013123 nm long, 75.5\u201378.1 nm wide; Figure 3).",

While SVCV can replicate in fish, bird and mammalian cell cultures, optimal cell systems are those derived from cyprinid fish, such as EPC (Fijan et al., 1983), which grows at 20\u201322\u00b0C. The CPE of SVCV is characterized by a margination of nuclear chromatin followed by a rounding up, detachment and lysis of cells. The presently obtained results are consistent with these descriptions. However, given that SVCV is closely related to the pike fry rhabdovirus, an SVCV\u2010specific RT\u2010PCR was used to obtain a more precise identification (Stone et al., 2003). The second round of the semi\u2010nested PCR protocol amplified a prominent 606\u2010bp product corresponding to nucleotides 373\u2013978 of the SVCV glycoprotein. Genetic clustering and geographical origin are closely linked for SVCV strains, which can be divided into the Asian and European clades (Miller et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2003). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial glycoprotein genes obtained for the SVCV isolates (Carp\u20101 and Carp\u20102) resulted in placement into the Ia genogroup, closely related to the American isolates (Figure 5).",

Unfortunately, the SVCV pathogen obtained from Mexican common carp was not confirmed by an international reference laboratory, nor has detection been reported to the OIE. Nevertheless, the Mexican sanitary authorities (National Service of Health, Safety, and Agroalimentary Quality SENASICA, Spanish acronym) have been duly informed. SVCV can be particularly devastating for the carp aquaculture industry and has also been reported to infect other commercially important species, including sheatfish (Silurus glanis), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), goldfish (Carassius spp.), zebrafish (Danio rerio), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and tilapia (Sarotherodon niloticus) (OIE, 2017a). In addition to distinct varieties of carp, other aquaculture species farmed in Mexico could be impacted by SVCV (including rainbow trout and tilapia [CONAPESCA, 2017], as well as ornamental fish such as goldfish, zebrafish and other cyprinids). Such impacts can include death, as has been reported by Haghighi\u2010Khiabanian Asl, Bandehpour, Bandehpour, Sharifnia, and Kazemi (2008), who detected a molecularly uncharacterized SVCV\u2010like virus responsible for mortalities in adult rainbow trout. Likewise, tilapia, zebrafish and even trout could act as carriers of this viral agent (Emmenegger et al., 2016; OIE, 2017b).",

Death from a loss of sodium\u2013water balance is primarily caused by damaged haematopoietic and kidney tissues (Gaafar et al., 2011). In the current study, only five of the 10 analysed fish showed clinical signs typical of an SVCV infection; besides external and internal haemorrhages, the sampled fish also showed histological injuries in various tissues. While such injuries are not pathognomonic of SVCV, they are in line with descriptions in preliminary studies (Ahne et al., 2002; Gaafar et al., 2011; Negele, 1977). Surprisingly, however, no signs of disease or fish mortalities have been previously described for the Tecocomulco Lagoon, a situation that is difficult to explain or justify. It is important to note that while this lagoon is rurally located, it is visited by carp fishermen and tourists or weekend visitors. The Tecocomulco Lagoon is also host to several other species, including fish, such as charal (Chirostoma sp.), carps (Cyprinus spp., Ctenopharyngodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Amblycephala megalobrema, Mylopharyngodon piceus) and goldfish; amphibians, such as axolotl (Ambystoma velasci) and anurans like Rana moctezumae; and reptiles, such as the aquatic snake (Thamnophis eques).",

Taking into account existing Mexican regulations, the results of this study do not demonstrate whether the isolated virus meets Koch's postulates. Except for studies on parasitic helminths (Monks et al., 2013), to date no health studies exist for aquatic organisms in the Tecocomulco Lagoon, despite the existence of records on water\u2010quality parameters (Aguilar\u2010Mart\u00ednez, 2007; Delgadillo, 2012), algae (Novelo et al., 2005; Quiroz\u2010Flores, Ram\u00edrez\u2010Garc\u00eda, & Lot\u2010Helgueras, 2014), macroinvertebrate populations (Rico\u2010S\u00e1nchez et al., 2014) and pesticide presence/levels (Aguilar\u2010Mart\u00ednez, 2007). Therefore, the impact of the isolated SVCV pathogen on fish populations in the Tecocomulco Lagoon remains unclear, and information regarding mortalities associated with this or prior cases is unavailable. This information gap could be due to the large size of the lagoon (1,769 ha; Rico\u2010S\u00e1nchez et al., 2014) or, perhaps, due to the asymptomatic nature of affected fish, which act as SVCV carriers (Ahne et al., 2002). Furthermore, the lack of an active health\u2010monitoring programme in Mexico (Ortega, 2012) and scarce knowledge of aquatic environments have conditioned local residents and fishermen to view low mortality rates as \u201cnormal,\u201d without concerns for identifying the cause.

The obtained results are similar to those described by Garver et al. (2007), who isolated SVCV from asymptomatic common carp in Lake Ontario (Canada). This correlates with observations that SVCV infection is mostly clinically inapparent (Ahne et al., 2002; OIE, 2017b). On the other hand, the clinical occurrence of an SVCV outbreak in goldfish specimens in a lake near Sao Paulo (Brazil) resulted in a 70% mortality rate (Alexandrino et al., 1998). In addition to the inherent difference of the involved infectious agents, variations in the manifested clinical signs, injuries and mortalities could be related to management practices and environmental conditions. In this case, it could be that the fish inhabited a large lagoon without spatial restrictions and with low stress. However, it is hard to calculate the impacts of several factors, including of fishing activities; sanitary and livestock drainage discharge; erosion; and the gradual extraction of water for farming, which results in new vegetation (Delgadillo, 2012). All of these factors could serve as environmental stressors that affect pathogenesis transmission and organism infection.",

Also of possible relevance, this site is host to nearly 120 bird species, 78 of which are land species and 42 of which are aquatic species (Gobierno del estado de Hidalgo, 2003). Of the aquatic birds, 29 migrate from North America, where SVCV has been detected in wild (Garver et al., 2007) and farmed (OIE, 2017a) fish. It is important to underscore that the objective of this study is not to clarify the origin of the SVCV in fish from the Tecocomulco Lagoon, which, as a closed body of water, could mean a range of possibilities, such as the virus being introduced through carp stocking (a common practice in Mexico since the end of the 19th century; Tapia & Zambrano, 2003; Wakida\u2010Kusunoki & Amador\u2010del\u2010\u00c1ngel, 2011); through migratory birds acting as viral vector carriers (Ahne et al., 2002); or even through the importation of ornamental fish, including different types of cyprinids, zebrafish and guppy (Poecilia reticulata; Zambrano & Mac\u00edas\u2010Garc\u00eda, 2000), which are species susceptible to or that act as carriers for SVCV (Ahne et al., 2002; Ashraf et al., 2016).",

This exotic virus could, therefore, represent a potential threat to native and culture fish populations in Mexico. Further contributing to this potential threat is that one of the factors related to SVCV appearance is the temperature range in which fish live, with 10\u201317\u00b0C being optimum (Ahne et al., 2002). In Europe, the appearance of SVCV is related to temperature increases after winter. In the case of the Tecocomulco Lagoon, the water temperature fluctuates yearly between 13.1\u00b0C and 21.2\u00b0C (Delgadillo, 2012; Novelo et al., 2005; Quiroz\u2010Flores et al., 2014); during the sampling period, the temperature range was closer to 13.1\u201315.1\u00b0C (Delgadillo, 2012).",
