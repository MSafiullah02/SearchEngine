            "text": "Creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) catalyzes the reversible reaction between ADP and phosphocreatine to form creatine and ATP. Phosphocreatine acts as a phosphate donor for the formation of ATP, which is needed for muscle contraction. At rest CK contributes to restoration of phosphocreatine concentration using ATP in excess of that needed by muscle. In people, tissues with the highest CK activity include skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, followed by neural tissue, although its activity per gram of neural tissue is low owing to the large amount of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Low CK activity can be detected in other tissues, such as gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, kidney, and thyroid.\n1\n CK is primarily cytoplasmic and leakage from injured or inflamed tissues leads to increased CK activity in blood, permitting assay of plasma or serum CK activity as a biomarker of tissue damage. CK is a dimer composed of B monomers, M monomers, or both, with a moderate degree of structural homology between the 2 subunits and between different species.\n2\n Combinations of these monomers generate isoenzymes CK\u2010BB, CK\u2010MB, and CK\u2010MM, which can be found predominantly in brain, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle, respectively.\n3\n CK\u2010BB, CK\u2010MB, and CK\u2010MM are also called CK1, CK2, and CK3, respectively, according to their electrophoretic migration. In addition to the 3 dimeric CK isoenzymes, there is a structurally different mitochondrial isoform, CK\u2010MT or CKm, detectable in tissues, and 2 macroenzymes, macro\u2010CK1 and macro\u2010CK2, detectable in blood. Macro\u2010CK1 is dimeric CK\u2010BB bound to immunoglobulins macro\u2010CK2 consists of oligomers of CK\u2010MT.\n3\n\n",

Slices were immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after sampling and stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until use 1 day later. After thawing, tissues were placed in 1 mL of saline solution and manually homogenized using a tissue grinder (Glass/Teflon Potter Elvehjem Wheaton, Millville, NJ, USA). Following homogenization, fluid was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 2500g for 15 minutes. Supernatant was then transferred to another tube and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until use 1 week later. According to the manufacturer's instructions, if total CK activity is >750 U/L the sample should be diluted before electrophoretic fractionation of isoenzymes to prevent overlap of large bands and permit identification of single bands. Therefore, the total CK activity of each supernatant was determined using the CK\u2010NAC assay, and each sample was diluted to obtain CK activity of approximately 500 U/L. Electrophoresis of the supernatants of homogenized tissue was then performed using the same procedure for serum samples described below.",

The principle of the assay is that isoenzymes and macroenzymes have characteristic motility owing to the electric charge of the subunits. After migration, CK fractions are visualized based on a reaction catalyzed by all the CK fractions and based on the conversion of creatine phosphate to a chromogenic compound (formazan) through a series of intermediate reactions involving substrates and cofactors included in the kit. Briefly, 200 \u03bcL of serum or supernatant from homogenized tissues were mixed with 2 \u03bcL of activating solution containing \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol and incubated for 10 minutes at approximately 20\u00b0C. For feline samples, 10 \u03bcL of activated serum or supernatant from homogenized tissues were placed in the wells of the applicator provided with the kit. For canine samples, 20 \u03bcL were applied as preliminary testing revealed that weak bands were generated when 10 \u03bcL were applied. Agarose gel (8%, pH 8.40\u00b10.05, included in the kit) and the applicator were placed in the migration chamber, and the automated migration program was then selected. After migration (10\u201320 W, 27 V h, 20\u00b0C) CK substrate containing chromogenic solution was applied and the reaction was stopped using blocking solution. Gels were then washed, dried by heating, and placed on the scanner provided with the instrument.

The low activity of CK in canine serum required a modification of the manufacturer's protocol and a doubling of the amount of serum applied to achieve visible bands. The creation of a specific \u201ccanine ISO\u2010CK\u201d program with a longer application time, increasing the amount of serum transferred to the gel, is advisable in the future. This low CK activity may have been a storage artifact as a previous study\n17\n and preliminary experiments in our laboratory (data not shown) demonstrated that freezing and thawing decreases CK activity. This decrease, however, accounts for <10% of native CK activity. Low total CK activity in our canine group was similar to that reported in previous studies,\n8\n, \n11\n and discrepancies between the serum CK activities in healthy animals, especially cats, in this study and other studies\n18\n, \n19\n may result from differences in analytical methods rather than storage artifacts. Similarly, analysis of interassay imprecision for isoenzyme fractions in pooled serum samples did not reveal a common trend (neither an increase nor a decrease of percentages) associated with prior storage at \u221220\u00b0C. It should be emphasized that a complete validation study, which would have provided more detailed information about possible storage artifacts on isoenzyme electrophoresis, was not performed. Specifically, the number of replicates in our preliminary testing was less than is recommended to assess both intra\u2010 and interassay imprecision, and stability should be assessed using a different approach.\n20\n Despite these limitations, CVs indicated acceptable repeatability and reproducibility of isoenzyme determinations, comparable with those reported by the kit manufacturer for CK\u2010BB, CK\u2010MB, and CK\u2010MM in human serum,\n21\n independent of storage conditions. A more detailed evaluation of storage\u2010related artifacts, however, is recommended before suggesting clinical application of automated CK gel electrophoresis.

Unfortunately, information about histologic brain lesions in the dogs, types of tumors, or degree of invasiveness of the tumors is lacking, precluding conclusions about the utility of CK\u2010BB as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for specific CNS diseases in dogs. However, these preliminary results suggest that studies to evaluate which types of CNS disorders are characterized by increases in CK\u2010BB activity would be valuable.",

Previous reports demonstrated that some areas of feline brain express CK\u2010BB.\n24\n Analysis of supernatants from homogenized feline brain in our study also confirmed that CK\u2010BB is present in brain tissue and has the same migration pattern as in dogs. Interestingly, CK\u2010BB seems to be almost absent, or below detection limits, in serum from healthy animals and from most cats with FIP. Total CK activity was greater in cats with FIP than in healthy cats, but this finding has poor diagnostic specificity as increased CK activity occurs in several pathophysiologic conditions, including anorexia,\n17\n myopathy,\n18\n metabolic syndromes,\n25\n and CNS disorders.\n26\n The lack of consistent alterations in CK\u2010BB activity in cats with FIP may have several explanations. Neurologic FIP is a pyogranulomatous meningitis, and CNS tissue is only secondarily affected.\n16\n Although the blood\u2013brain barrier is usually damaged, it is possible that leakage of CK\u2010BB from neurons is minimal. Another possible explanation is that CK\u2010BB is released by CNS cells but binds to immunoglobulins that are abundant in the serum of cats with FIP\n16\n and also can be found in cerebrospinal fluid.\n27\n This would explain the increase of macro\u2010CK1, which is a dimer of CK\u2010BB and IgG.\n14\n Further studies on central neurologic diseases in cats are required to investigate the potential utility of the CK\u2010BB assay, but based on these results, CK\u2010BB does not appear to have clinical utility in supporting a diagnosis of FIP with CNS involvement.",

Promising results about the possible use of CK\u2010BB as a biomarker of central neurologic disorders in dogs were obtained, whereas in cats with FIP the quantification of CK\u2010BB does not seem to have clinical utility. Future studies to investigate the type of CNS disorders responsible for increases in CK\u2010BB activity in dogs and to explore feline central neurologic disorders other than FIP in cats are indicated to define the diagnostic and prognostic potential of CK\u2010BB in a larger number of cases. Additionally, studies on the diagnostic utility of electrophoresis of CK isoenzymes and macroenzymes in cerebrospinal fluid collected from dogs and cats with central neurologic disease may be warranted.",
