It can be initiated wherever the patient presents with ARF-in the PED, PICU, or other areas of the hospital. Over the last decade, several studies have suggested successful application of NIV in patients with ARF. Although numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown its effi ciency in different forms of ARF (e.g., exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema in adults), the evidence supporting its using in infants and children with ARF is still limited, and there are no generally accepted guidelines for its use. However, the most recent physiological and randomized studies indicate that the early application of NIV improves the breathing pattern and gas exchange and reduces respiratory muscle effort in children [ 1 -7 ] .",

In these circumstances, most of the studies showed that the use of NIV decreased the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia and reduced the duration of oxygen requirement without prolonging the hospital stay [ 4 -8 ] . On the other hand, there is controversy about the possibility that NIV increases the spread of viral infections during pandemics. Moreover, since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, pandemic planners around the world have classifi ed NIV as a high risk procedure that should be used cautiously because of possible spread of the infection [ 9 ] . Similarly, Ontario's Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee in Canada recommended that NIV be avoided for patients with febrile respiratory illness during the 2009 infl uenza pandemic (H1N1) [ 10 ] . Additionally, the World Health Organization's interim guidelines on the prevention and control of acute respiratory diseases associated with health care have included NIV among the aerosol-generating procedures in which there is possibly an increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission [ 11 ] . However, there has been no evidence-based information to support the claim that the use of NIV increases the risk of transmitting infectious diseases.",

One was occasioned by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is an emerging infectious disease that fi rst manifested in humans in China in 2002. In an observational study of the SARS outbreak that included adult patients from China, the effectiveness of NIV in the treatment of ARF was investigated. It was shown that NIV was effective in preventing the use of endotracheal intubation in 70 % of patients because of its early initiation in the SARS patients. In this study, none of the health workers, including doctors, nurses, and health-care assistants, acquired SARS from the patients. As an explanation, NIV was applied in a negative-pressure environment with strict personal protection and close monitoring of the health status of all involved staff [ 4 ] . In another study from Toronto during SARS, the use of NIV was discouraged especially after clinicians contracted the disease when a patient was intubated following NIV failure [ 9 ] . Therefore, some clinicians considered NIV contraindicated for ARF due to airborne respiratory diseases unless it is used in a negative-pressure isolation room and strict precautions are taken [ 4 , 9 ] .",

The role of NIV in children with ARF due to infl uenza A(H1N1) was also the subject of controversy, although NIV has become an important mechanism for ventilator support for pediatric ARF. Severe respiratory failure is a well-recognized complication of pandemic H1N1 infl uenza infection. Rello et al. [ 16 ] applied NIV to a small number of critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1 infection complicated by ARF. Most of these patients subsequently required IMV support. Therefore, NIV is generally not recommended for patients with the novel infl uenza infection complicated by pneumonia and ARDS. NIV temporarily improves oxygenation and reduces the work of breathing but does not necessarily alter the course of the disease. The need for NIV is an indication of severe disease and likelihood of IMV. In addition, hemodynamic instability and multi-organ failure are contraindications for applying NIV [ 2 , 16 , 17 ] .",

NIV was considered based on guidelines regarding ARF that included severe dyspnea at rest [respiration rate (RR) > 35/ min], PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 200 while breathing oxygen through a mask, and use of accessory muscles of respiration or paradoxical abdominal motion. Criteria for a response to NIV, or lack of it, were RR improvement, the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and blood gases improvement. Intubation was considered if there was intolerance to the mask or there was a contraindication to continued use, including nasal bridge necrosis, persistent hypoxemia not responding to appropriate and tolerated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), or persistent or worsening respiratory acidosis. In all, 32.1 % of patients were managed with NIV. However 17 % of all patients failed NIV and were intubated and ventilated invasively. Patients who could be started on and managed with NIV had signifi cantly better survival compared with those who required IMV at the onset. The need for invasive ventilation at admission was found to be associated with a higher mortality rate [ 18 ] .",

A subgroup of patients, often with underlying chronic disorders or risk factors such as immunosuppression, can develop pneumonia/respiratory insuffi ciency with H1N1 swine fl u or other infl uenzal infection and require treatment by oxygen therapy, nebulized medication, and ventilatory support. These therapies are thought to generate droplets or aerosols. Based on pandemic experience, gas leakage via exhalation ports may also disperse infectious particles into the environment. During pandemics, HCWs and other patients are at risk for contamination because of the virus. In addition, pandemic planners have highlighted the potential need for providing mechanical ventilation in environments that are safe for HCWs. They have recommended airborne precautions for HCWs who are managing patients with pandemic infl uenza with increased transmissibility and during procedures that may generate small aerosol particles of respiratory secretions. However, it is not known how exhaled air and particles may disperse during NIV in clinical settings. There is no reliable marker that can be safely introduced to the patients [ 23 -25 ] .",

It is also known that NIV can markedly reduce the need for endotracheal intubation and the rate of complications. It shortens the hospital length of stay and improves survival. NIV can be used to decrease a patient's dyspnea and work of breathing and improve gas exchange. Therefore, patients with hypercapnic forms of ARF are most likely to benefi t from NIV. However, clinicians should not forget that NIV is a complementary technique and cannot replace endotracheal intubation under all conditions. The success of NIV relies on several factors, including the type and severity of ARF, very low arterial blood pH, marked alteration in mental status, underlying disease, location of treatment, and the experience of the team. The time factor is also important. To prevent further deterioration, early NIV must become an important part of the fi rst-line treatment of ARF. In addition, the success of invasive ventilation is dependent on various clinical aspects and the organisation of care-but also on a number of technical issues. These technical points are the ventilator interface, type of humidifi er, and ventilator used and its capabilities for triggering and pressurization. The general care of the NIV patient is different from that for a patient undergoing invasive ventilation and potentially has a great infl uence on the success of the technique. Noninvasive ventilation has become an important mechanism for ventilator support in children with ARF. However, if the ARF is due to the infl uenza A(H1N1) virus, NIV has become controversial. Future prospective randomized controlled studies should help determine, with more methodology, the physiological effects of NIV and the most appropriate group of patients potentially able to benefi t from this promising technique during a pandemic. The studies have shown that in critically ill children with confi rmed or probable H1N1 viral infection and severe ARDS the use of NIV can result in signifi cant improvement in oxygenation. It may improve the mortality rate for this very high-risk population.",

The laser light sheet illuminated the smoke particles after the mask airfl ow leakage.

If the HCW is standing outside a radial distance of approximately 0.25 m from the mask, there is <10 % chance of exposure to the exhaled air.
