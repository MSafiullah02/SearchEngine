In contrast, TANF provides states with a fixed block grant allowing savings or extra costs to accrue to the states. Further, PRWORA mandated states to include much stronger work requirements for cash assistance and to restrict benefits to a lifetime maximum of five years. In addition, states were given greater leeway over the administration of their cash public assistance program in terms of benefit amount, time limits, work requirements, and eligibility (Blank, 2002, Garfinkel et al., 2010).

            "text": "Despite the fact that TANF policies are broadly guided by federal policy, the generosity and resulting inclusiveness of these individual policy choices reflects voter preference. For instance, one study examined the variation in TANF policies and benefits among five US states, finding that states who were committed to bolstering the safety net for children, such as California, reflected this mission in their eligibility rules, absence of a time limit, and relatively large cash benefit amounts. Conversely, Texas aimed to make TANF a \u2018last resort,\u2019 pushing for employment support over cash assistance with relatively small payments (Hahn, Golden, & Stanczyk, 2012). Further, states can spend TANF funds on a range of cash and in-kind benefits to address budget shortfalls in other areas of state responsibility. For instance, if a state failed to win a Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) demonstration waiver in a given year, they may decide to allocate a larger portion of TANF funding to fill a gap in child care services as opposed to increasing the availability or generosity of cash benefits. Though these funds would largely affect the same population, that they\u2019re earmarked differently may have different policy implications. As up to 30 percent of TANF funds can be allocated to CCDBG and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) combined, this may account for a large portion of variation in TANF welfare benefit generosity and access (Ziliak, 2015). To put this in perspective, 35 states spent less than quarter of their TANF funds on cash assistance in 2014 \u2013 the remainder was spent on child care, work support, child welfare, and other social services such as pre-kindergarten programs, family formation support, etc. (Bitler and Hoynes, 2016a, Bitler and Hoynes, 2016b). Yet, for a state in an economic downturn with relatively scarce employment opportunities, childcare and workforce development spending may be less beneficial than cash assistance and ultimately, fail to affect poverty at the same rate as the cash benefit structure under AFDC. Along with the fact that TANF is non-responsive to business cycle fluctuations,\n5 it is not surprising that its anti-poverty effectiveness has been outpaced by EITC and SNAP.",

            "text": "Welfare reform encompassed more than just the transition from AFDC to TANF. In an effort to \u201cmake work pay\u201d, states played an increasingly important role in the design of tax credit programs. State versions of the EITC currently exist in just over half of the US states with state income taxes, with tremendous variation in their structure and generosity.\n6 Wisconsin was the first to enact a state supplement to the federal EITC in 1983 (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2016a). Today, 29 states have a state supplement to the EITC, 23 of which are fully refundable. States continue to expand and reform their credits by increasing the size of the benefit relative to the federal EITC, changing the refundable status, and changing the income eligibility definition. Not all of these reforms are to the benefit of the worker. For example, in 2017 Connecticut reduced its credit from 27.5 percent of the federal EITC to 23 percent, and Oklahoma and Michigan recently reduced their credits by 70 percent (Williams & Waxman, 2018). As state and local taxes tend to disproportionately burden low-income workers, state EITCs can be crucial for achieving a more equitable tax system (Williams & Waxman, 2018). The percent of the federal EITC provided by states ranges from 3.5% in Louisiana to 40% in Washington DC in 2012 (Appendix 1).",

The refundable part of the CTC \u2013 which until recently was named the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) \u2013 benefits low-wage workers earning more than $2,500 per year, resulting in a refund of 15 percent of their earnings up to $1,400 per child (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), 2018). Though the federal CTC is available to all filers, state CTCs exist in only a handful of states \u2013 New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Colorado, and California, only two of which are refundable (Tax Credits for Workers and Their Families, 2016).

Today SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program, provides almost 70 billion dollars in assistance to low-income individuals and families each year. Under PRWORA, states were also given new discretion in SNAP administration, resulting in diversification of these policies as well. Though the program was voluntarily adopted by states upon its rollout in 1962, it was available nationwide by 1974 with very little cross-state variation in policies (Hoynes, Schanzenbach, & Almond, 2016). PRWORA gave states latitude to both establish and run SNAP offices, develop applications and some eligibility requirements, and set recertification intervals, resulting in the much wider range of participation rates we see today (Dean, 2016; Ribar & Swann, 2013).\n7 Further, more generous or inclusive states make a more concerted effort to enroll eligible residents, resulting in improved coverage under similar eligibility scenarios, whereas other states might take advantage of policy flexibilities in order to cover budget shortfalls or other gaps in funding. Much like TANF, PRWORA gave states the ability to manipulate policies to either the benefit or to the detriment of their low-income population. Among those eligible for SNAP in our sample, participation rates ranged from almost 51% in California to about 81% in Michigan between 2010 and 2012.\n8\n",

Meyer & Rosenbaum, 2001), poverty, income, family formation, and fertility changes (Ben-Shalom et al., 2011, Ellwood, 2000, Moffitt et al., 2020). The few papers that have evaluated the relationship between welfare policy and poverty have generally done so with a focus on TANF (De Jong et al., 2006, Ziliak, 2007). That TANF is now such a small component of the safety net is the first major limitation of prior literature that we address here. A second major limitation of research on the poverty impacts of welfare reform is that it almost exclusively uses the official poverty measure (Bitler and Hoynes, 2016a, Bitler and Hoynes, 2016b, McKernan and Ratcliffe, 2005).",

One of the main methodological advantages of the SPM is that it can be used to investigate the impact of various tax credits and in-kind transfer programs on poverty as these are included in its computation. In this paper, we use this facet of the SPM to simulate SPM child poverty rates if all states were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in four policies: SNAP, EITC, CTC, and TANF. Essentially, we are asking: what would the effect on child poverty be if the states engaged in a \u201crace to the top\u201d in anti-poverty policy? We address two major limitations of the prior literature: the extensive focus on TANF, a program that now appears to have an almost negligible effect on poverty reduction (Ben-Shalom et al., 2011, Fox et al., 2015), and the use of an out-of-date measure of poverty.",

As described on the TRIM website (The Urban Institute, 2016), TRIM simulates actual program rules in each year to correct for under-reporting of transfer program benefits in the input data, which in this paper is the CPS ASEC. Like most household surveys, the CPS suffers from under-reporting of benefits. For example, the authors of one study (B D Meyer, Mok, & Sullivan, 2009) conducted a comprehensive analysis of under-reporting problems of ten government transfer programs in five nationally-representative public surveys. They reported that only sixty percent of SNAP dollars are correctly reported in the CPS ASEC; the under-reporting rates of TANF have increased since 2000 and the correct report rates were on average, lower than 70 percent. One recent study compared TRIM to alternative statistical methods for correcting underreporting and concluded that for descriptive estimations, TRIM is adequate for predicting average poverty rates, as we do here (Mittag, 2019). As TRIM over-assigns benefits to those who report zero gross income in CPS, as well as those below 50% of the poverty level, additional adjustments are required when examining deep SPM poverty. However, we omit deep SPM poverty outcomes from the current study on account of sample size limitations. The authors of a related study (Stevens, Fox, & Heggeness, 2018) find that SPM poverty rates meaningfully fall when using TRIM adjustments to SNAP benefit levels, however the differences are much smaller when examining average enrollment rates as we do here. For these reasons, we use augmented CPS ASEC data with TRIM-adjusted revisions and corrections to the benefit amounts received from SNAP, Supplemental Security Income, and TANF. The CPS ASEC is the source for official poverty and labor market statistics, and provides a large and nationally representative sample of children. We use the 2010-2012 CPS ASEC (survey years 2009 \u2013 2011) as these are the most recent years for which TRIM data were available at the time of this writing. While a number of states have adopted more generous policies since then (California, for example, created a state EITC in 2015), the benefits of more accurate adjustments for under-reporting outweigh any advantages of using a more recent time period in which the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and other social policy expansions took place.",

SPM poverty thresholds are also re-defined to increase gradually over time as families\u2019 consumption at the top of the bottom third of the income distribution changes. The SPM also takes relative living expenses into account by increasing poverty thresholds in relatively more expensive locations, and reducing them in relatively less expensive locations.

In addition to the resources that SPM units have at their disposal and the SPM poverty thresholds that apply to their geographic location, we use a variety of demographic variables in the subgroup analyses. As undocumented immigrants are ineligible for benefits and legal immigrants face a waiting period, we exclude foreign-born non-citizens from either Mexico or Central America from benefit receipt in our simulations, as this definition captures the demographic characteristics of the majority of undocumented immigrants in the United States (Gelatt & Zong, 2018).Although this implicitly assumes that recipients cannot trade or barter benefits or acquire them in some other way, without information on undocumented immigration in the survey, this is the most conservative estimate given the limitations in CPS ASEC data. That being said, we are likely misclassifying a number of individuals as undocumented who are in fact documented, thus not allocating simulated benefits to those who are eligible. As a proxy for not having legal status, this exclusion is undoubtedly overly broad, but its broadness has the virtue of yielding more conservative estimates of the potential poverty reduction that could occur due to state policy.",

Though generosity can be conceived and operationalized in multiple ways, we chose to measure generosity here as both benefit amount (generosity) and the enrollment rate among eligible individuals (inclusiveness), as we describe in depth below. For TANF and SNAP, we do not simulate the reduction in child poverty if all states had the same benefit amount, rather, we model changes in the proportion of eligible individuals receiving benefits, or program inclusiveness, for two reasons. First, many states with a higher cost of living \u2013 Hawaii, California, and Alaska \u2013 have higher benefit amounts. While it is reasonable to expect that states might provide benefits to the same share of their eligible populations, it may not be reasonable to expect them to offer the same benefit amount given the differences in their cost of living. Second, in the case of TANF, the federal government endows states the autonomy to allocate funding according to their preferences, ranging from cash income support to workforce development and childcare for higher-earning families. Accordingly, in the effort to simulate plausible state choices rather than immovable factors, we focus on program inclusiveness alone for TANF and SNAP simulations. For the state EITC and state CTC, generosity refers to the size of the state credit relative to federal credits.",

Data on benefits received in the form of cash income are only available annually. An alternative measure of generosity for both TANF and SNAP might be the size of the benefit payment. However, in contrast to daily or monthly measure of benefit receipt, an annual measure of benefits fails to capture income volatility, which is especially prevalent among the lower-income respondents. Having only yearly benefit information also precludes us from using variation in benefit levels and generosity across states.

The proportion of eligible individuals receiving TANF in California is thus the inclusiveness \u201ctarget\u201d for the other states in the TANF simulation.\n9 Though SNAP is a federal program, like TANF, there is substantial state-level variation in the fraction of eligible individuals receiving benefits.

This approach approximates actual take up rates under the implicit assumption that the neediest recipients receive the benefits largest among the eligible population. We assign benefit amounts using state inclusiveness tertile rather than actual state benefit amounts because small sample sizes in some states preclude obtaining average benefits in every state by all three of the other characteristics (resources-to-needs, number of adults, and number of children). The average annual benefits received by individuals in each simulation are summarized in Appendix Table 3. We assign benefits to eligible individuals in the simulation until the same proportion of qualifying individuals in each state are receiving TANF as in California.",

This tax calculator simulates the amount of Federal EITC individuals are estimated to have received based on their earned income, the rules governing eligibility, etc. While the calculator provides total state taxes paid and received after all credits, it provides no direct information on the amount that individuals receive in state EITC, though this would only produce erroneous estimates among those who file federal tax returns but not state tax returns, an expectedly small fraction of the tax-filing population.

The amount of state EITC that individuals receive in the simulation is less, on average, than what is received in the TANF simulation (see Appendix Table 3), however relatively more people receive the state EITC in the simulation, and those that do are spread more widely across the income distribution (Appendix Table 8). The EITC is only for working families, so those who have no cash income or are unemployed do not benefit from the EITC. The largest increase in children\u2019s resources-to-needs ratio in the EITC simulation is among children in poverty (Appendix Table 8) due to their very low starting point. Children who are in poverty experience on average a 4.1% increase in their resources-to-needs ratio in the EITC simulation. Children at 100-200% of the poverty line experience on average a 2.2% increase in their resources-to-needs, and children over 200% of the poverty line experience an average of 0.1% increase.

If all states adopted the most generous or inclusive state policy in all four policy areas, a total of 5.5 million children would be pulled out of poverty -- a reduction of 2.5 percentage points, on average. Though these effects are sizeable, there is some evidence that our estimates may underestimate the true effect (Hoynes & Patel, 2015).

If states with more abundant resources are also the most generous or inclusive \u2013 and those that have fewer resources are the least generous or inclusive \u2013 then it could be that less-generous or inclusive states have higher child poverty rates simply because of their lack of capacity to invest in anti-poverty policies given competing priorities and scarce resources. If this is the case, allocating funds to these anti-poverty programs may be infeasible without offsetting other lines in the budget. Alternatively, if there is no relationship between poverty rates and generosity or inclusiveness, states may be allocating funds away from child poverty investments as a matter of choice, rather than necessity, implying that states have some flexibility in prioritizing child well-being. It is of course worth mentioning that state revenue and capacity is subject to states\u2019 choices not just about resource allocation but about how much state tax revenue they bring in in the first place. For example, a number of states choose to have no or very little state income tax or make other choices that limit the amount of revenue generated that could be used to reduce poverty.",

The TANF inclusiveness simulation is an informative case study of the scenario under which this might occur. While the average TANF benefit amount received in the TANF simulation is relatively large (see Appendix Table 3 for average benefit amounts received in each simulation in each state), very few people have sufficiently low resources to qualify. The TANF simulation thus allocates benefits to a small number of people in absolute terms, diminishing the anti-poverty effect of the simulated increase in inclusiveness. Since the individuals who are eligible to receive the TANF benefit in the simulation have quite low \u2013 if any \u2013 resources, the subsequent benefit receipt often does not push them over the poverty line (a point that we consider more fully below). Finally, some of the states already have coverage close to the target, so they have very little room for improvement in the simulation. All of these factors operate to produce relatively small declines in poverty in some states in the TANF simulation and many operate in the other program simulations as well.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to the analyses presented in this paper. First, we do not model any behavioral, employment, or labor market changes that might result from the receipt of additional benefits. Though potential behavioral effects such as labor market participation and effort should not be ignored, there is some evidence that these combined behavioral effects are relatively small (Ben-Shalom et al., 2011) and in the case of the EITC (and by extension, likely the CTC) behavioral effects would lead to greater labor force participation, implying that the anti-poverty effects we estimate may be understated (Hoynes & Patel, 2015). TANF and SNAP are thought to have a negative work incentive, however under work requirements and time limits the net effect for TANF should be close to zero. For a detailed discussion of the labor market responses and other behavioral effects of these programs, see e.g. Ben-Shalom et al. (2011) and Duncan & Le Menestrel (2019). Future empirical studies should attempt to model the aggregate impact and magnitude of such aggregate behavioral impacts across programs. The second limitation to our analysis is that we do not model the effect of imposing new state taxes that would be required to finance increases in benefits. Different financing methods could somewhat alter the distributional impacts of proposed reforms, though unless such financing were significantly regressive in nature, they are unlikely to affect the overall effects on poverty found here. On a related note, we harness data from 2009-2011 (survey years 2010 \u2013 2012) as these more accurately reflect actual tax obligations and underreporting adjustments under TRIM3. What we gain in precision, however, may be lost in generalizability as this period may reflect atypical state policy variation on account of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and post-recession recovery. That said, this period may be particularly relevant to the current state of the economy on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, evidence drawn from expansions during our period of inquiry may better inform economic recovery than the period immediately before COVID-19 due to similar macroeconomic conditions. Future researchers should consider using more recent data, reflecting a longer post-recession recovery period, conditional upon the accuracy of correcting for underreporting. Though outside the scope of the present paper, more recent innovations in dealing with underreporting should be considered as well. For example, the author of a recent paper compared statistical methods for correcting underreporting for SNAP using linked administrative data (Mittag, 2019), finding that adjustments on the tails of the income distribution are by far the most meaningful. Third, our SNAP and TANF simulations exclude undocumented individuals, for whom poverty among children may have been more significantly affected. Similarly, these individuals are included in the EITC and CTC simulations at the risk of over-ascertaining the effects of these programs (as parental SSNs are required for tax credit eligibility). This important limitation should be addressed in future research, particularly on account of a more recent policy shift allowing child-only SSN eligibility (Duncan & Le Menestrel, 2019). Fourth, as the focus of this study is on cash and near-cash benefits, we do not simulate the effects of scaling up other anti-poverty policies in the present study. As many of these policies convey benefits beyond their monetary value to enrollees, the presumed benefit extends beyond poverty relief into other benefits to health and well-being. Though outside the scope of the present study, a related study presents the results of a similar exercise assigning Medicaid benefits to non-beneficiaries in non-expansion states (Zewde & Wimer, 2019). Future research should consider the merit of a similar approach in consideration of the other policies. At the same time, that the policies we examine here fail to address the root causes of child poverty should not be ignored. Indeed, these policies fail to fully address factors that cause child poverty, such as racial and ethnic discrimination, structural inequalities, and discriminatory access to education. Rather, this set of policies buffers the potentially devastating effects of economic shocks, helping families to better smooth income in times of uncertainty. Accordingly, it is important that future research acknowledges the strengths and limitations of these policies. Finally, future research should consider examining the potential administrative and enrollment costs of the simulated policy expansions we explore here. Precise cost estimates of this nature would enable accurate cost-benefit comparisons across policies to inform future legislative decision making.",

The equivalent numbers are 816,558 for the CTC simulation, 985,776 for the TANF simulation, and 1,340,499 for the SNAP simulation. In the state CTC simulation, the average benefit amount is quite low and spread through a relatively larger range of the income distribution, reducing its efficiency in poverty reduction. There is somewhat less room for reducing poverty in the TANF inclusiveness simulation than in the state EITC generosity simulation because the current income threshold to receive TANF (even in an inclusive state) is so low that few people qualify for the benefit.

Finally, it should be noted that the reforms we model are relatively modest \u2013 designed not as ideal policies but rather as examples of the effects of expanding policies already in existence. We illustrate that changes to current policies \u2013 based on what other states have deemed feasible and appropriate \u2013 can have a range of (including somewhat large) effects on child poverty. For example, in the case of TANF, some states saw no change in child poverty (see e.g. Appendix Table 4). Of course, more ambitious reforms, such as a minimum benefit, could have even larger effects \u2013 a topic we hope to address in future research. While this paper simulated the effects of four major anti-poverty policies, there are many other policies that affect the economic wellbeing of low-income families. We encourage researchers to apply similar simulation methodology to other policy areas in order to quantify and prioritize areas in which strengthening public policy would produce the greatest increase in public wellbeing.",
