This produces a gene genealogy. Coalescent theory seeks to understand the statistical properties of this genealogy under different selective or demographic scenarios.IncidenceNew cases of disease occurring within a specified time period.Malthusian fitnessWhere the population is growing in size, individuals that reproduce more quickly gain an advantage and will come to predominate even if their total net number of onward infections is less than more slowly growing competitors.PhylodynamicsThe use of phylogenetic data to infer elements of epidemiological processes that have given rise to it, by examining the shape and topology of the genealogy as estimated from sequence data (see \u2018The Coalescent\u2019).PrevalenceThe frequency of a disease in a population at a particular time point. Often expressed as a proportion or percentage.Reproductive numberAlso known as the reproductive ratio or rate, this is the average number of onward transmission events produced from each infection.SIR modelIn an SIR model hosts move from the susceptible compartment (S), to the Infected (I) and then (if they survive infection) into a separate resistant (R) compartment. This allows us to model immunity, by allowing hosts in the R compartment to be less likely to be successfully infected. An extra level of complexity can allow immunity to wane over time such that eventually hosts in the R compartment return to the S one \u2013 resulting in an SIRS model.SIS modelIn an SIS model, hosts initially susceptible (S) become infected (I) and upon clearing the infection immediately becomes susceptible once more (S). Such simple models may be used where little or no immunity results from infection, or may be a useful approximation in the case that antigenic variation on the part of the pathogen is so rapid that immunity is negligible.SuperspreaderAn individual who infects a disproportionately large number of secondary hosts relative to the majority of cases of infection.ZoonosesAny case where transmission of infectious agents occurs between different species of animals, most often used when disease is transmitted from nonhumans to humans.\n",

            "text": "A crucial parameter in infectious disease epidemiology is R: how many successful transmission events and new infections result on average from one infection. With an unlimited pool of susceptible individuals, this is equivalent to R\n0 or the basic reproductive number. It is easy to intuitively relate these numbers to the course of an outbreak. If the reproductive number is >1, the expected number of new cases will increase, whereas if it is <1, then the numbers will fall. It is important to distinguish the incidence from the prevalence. Incidence is the number of new cases per unit time, whereas prevalence is the overall frequency of the disease in the population. The incidence can be falling but the prevalence can continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate. This is illustrated in Figure 1\n, which shows an idealized epidemic curve, and how R changes over the course of the outbreak. While in the illustrated case the epidemic burns out after the pathogen has run out of hosts to infect, if sufficient susceptible hosts are continually introduced (e.g., by birth or waning immunity) the disease can become endemic.",

            "text": "Although the expected final size of the outbreak falls rapidly as R\n0 decreases, it is possible for outbreaks to occur in the case where R\n0 is less than 1. To understand how this can happen we have to remember that R\n0 is an average value, and by chance initial cases may result in an above-average number of onward infections. The effects of this can be probed using a stochastic approach, in which events are modeled as randomly sampled realizations from a probability distribution. While such models aim to capture the typical contact and transmission dynamics in a population, they can be confounded by rare cases of extreme behavior. For instance, a so-called \u2018superspreader\u2019 event may by chance infect many new hosts, starting an outbreak that persists until all the transmission chains descending from it die out (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, Garske and Rhodes, 2008). For a real example of such a superspreader event, consider the early stages in the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in Hong Kong, when a single infected person infected at least 13 and possibly as many as 20 others staying at the same hotel (Braden et al., 2013). The estimated R\n0 for SARS is much lower than this unusual event would lead you to suspect (Riley et al., 2003).",

            "text": "We can construct a simple transmission model by dividing the population into compartments, and then writing down equations for the rate of movement of individuals from one compartment to another in each time step. The simplest models contain just two compartments: susceptible and infected (Figure 2(a) and 2(b)\n). The results are a so-called SI or SIS model. In the first example, hosts move from being susceptible to being infected, and in the second, to infected hosts can clear the infection and become susceptible again. The slightly more complicated SIR model adds a \u2018resistant\u2019 compartment (Figure 2(c)), reflecting immunity that prevents infection while waning immunity can be incorporated in a SIRS framework where after a period of time hosts in the resistant compartment move back to S (Figure 2(d)). This flexible approach can be extended to include important features such as vaccination (McLean, 1995) (in the simplest case of a 100% effective vaccine, each vaccinated susceptible would move to the resistant compartment), and host population structure. This is important in multiple contexts; for instance the child\u2013child contact rate is very high in daycare settings and hence the transmission rate too, which can have important consequences for model results (Schenzle, 1984). Similarly, humans vary greatly in the number and sort of sexual contacts they make, which is important to modeling sexually transmitted infections. In the case of vector-borne diseases, whether the vector is a biting insect or a health care worker (as in nosocomial infections), they can and should be incorporated into the model. It is easy to see intuitively how the endemic prevalence of disease depends on the supply of new susceptibles, either from birth or waning immunity.",

A considerable burden of disease also results from pathogens that transmit between humans rarely if at all.

It is commonly stated that virulence reflects an adaptive mismatch between the host and the pathogen: it is to the advantage of both parties that virulence be minimal, such that the host can continue to transmit for a long period of time without limits on the numbers of contacts they make. Empirical evidence for this comes from the example of myxomatosis in Australia, where the myxoma virus was introduced to control rabbit populations. With extraordinary vision, Frank Fenner of the Australia National University collected and stored isolates of virus collected from wild rabbits over decades, and showed evidence for both gradual attenuation of the virus, and adaptation of the rabbit population to become more resistant (Fenner, 1956).",

Surely more rapidly growing parasite variants should be selected during infection and, if this is linked to virulence, produce disease (Levin and Bull, 1994)? The tension between the two selective pressures \u2013 for growth within the host, and for transmission within the host population \u2013 is dependent on the link between virulence and transmission (Lipsitch and Moxon, 1997, Vale et al., 2011). If by causing disease, a pathogen transmits to more new hosts than it would do otherwise, then virulence will be increased even if the result is the death of the host or the clearance of the infection (Anderson and May, 1982). This explains virulence in terms of the theory of life-history tradeoffs. A crucial factor is the availability of new hosts, because if opportunities for transmission are rare it will select for variants that do not kill their hosts before they can transmit (Lipsitch and Nowak, 1995, Lenski and May, 1994). In an outbreak situation, virulence can be temporarily selected even if the virulent strain infects fewer hosts per infection than its competitors, provided it does so more quickly. Selection for more rapidly growing variants is also termed Malthusian fitness (Orr, 2009).",

HIV-1 infection includes a long asymptomatic period in which the viral load (the amount of virus particles in peripheral blood) fluctuates around a value known as the \u2018set point\u2019 (Mellors et al., 1996). It has been proposed that the set point viral load has been the object of selection to maximize transmission, the result of a trade off between the effect of set point viral load on infectiousness and the duration of the asymptomatic period (Fraser et al., 2007). If set point viral load is too high, then infected individuals have fewer opportunities to transmit before developing AIDS whereas if it is too low, they are not infectious enough to efficiently transmit the virus. For natural selection to act on set point viral load, it must be a heritable property. That is to say, the set point viral load of the infector and infected must be correlated. If it is not, then there is no heritable variation on which natural selection can work. Subsequent work has produced evidence that set point viral load is indeed heritable, and correlated with viral genotype (Hollingsworth et al., 2010, Alizon et al., 2010).",

This is now almost always done using molecular variation, i.e., nucleic acid sequences and the proteins they encode. How much variation is present in the population, and of what sort, is the result of evolution, and how data from molecular epidemiology studies are interpreted is a question of phylogenetics. Increasingly, populations of viruses and bacteria are characterized using genomic methods, and it is likely that in the near future whole genomes will become the standard for molecular epidemiology (Croucher et al., 2013).",

Each unique allele is identified by an integer, and the combination of these makes up the allelic profile and the sequence type (ST). MLST has been applied to numerous organisms. One of the side effects of the data collected by epidemiologists has been in the study of homologous recombination (reviewed in this volume by Feil).

            "text": "Using sequence data to infer demographic history is distinct from using it to infer recent transmission. At the extremely local level it is hoped that we might be able to define infector and infected using high-resolution sequence data alone. Indeed, highly resolving methods that stop short of the whole genome have been used as a valuable complement to classical contact tracing for the control of gonococcal disease (Bilek et al., 2007). At a higher level we might ask whether cases of disease occurring some distance apart are due to closely related pathogens, which might imply transmission over greater distances \u2013 for an example, involving wind-borne transmission of avian influenza see Ypma et al. (2013b). The overall principle is that the transmission tree is considered closely related to the phylogenetic tree (Ypma et al., 2013c). To be useful this need not be the precise resolution of who infected whom; different epidemiological events like superspreading (Ypma et al., 2013a) may leave distinct signatures in the resulting tree structure (Colijn and Gardy, 2014). Software packages are becoming available that implement multiple methods to probe sequence data to provide the detailed history of an outbreak (Jombart et al., 2014a, Jombart et al., 2014b). However, concerns exist over the potential for within-host evolution to produce sequence diversity that can obscure true transmission networks (Didelot et al., 2014, Worby et al., 2014). The amount of diversification that occurs within the host is not known in most cases, but may be large (Nasser et al., 2014). Coupled with the uncertainty arising from imperfect sampling and other missing data, it is likely that the most valuable uses of sequence data will be as a complement to traditional epidemiologic approaches (Ypma et al., 2012).",

As both pathogens and their hosts have evolved, evolutionary biology is relevant to understanding the nature of their interactions for fitness, and also in resolving the history of pathogen transmission. Mathematical models can explore the consequences of different selective scenarios, and molecular data can define strains and the genetic variation that is the raw material on which natural selection acts.
