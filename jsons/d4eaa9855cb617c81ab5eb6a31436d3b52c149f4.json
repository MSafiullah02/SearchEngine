It is a highly contagious disease and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a global public health emergency (Wang, Li-sheng and Wang, Yi-ru and Ye, Da-wei and Liu, Qing-quan (2020) ). It is originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China (PRC) in late December 2019, when a case of unidentified pneumonia was reported (Huang et al. (2020) ). PRC Centers for Disease Control (CDC) experts declared that pneumonia as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) as caused by a novel coronavirus and WHO officially named the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f disease COVID-19 (Huang et al. (2020) ). However, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is a class of \uf062 -coronavirus and has many potential natural hosts, intermediate hosts and final hosts as shown in Fig. 1 . Due to these characteristics, there is a great challenge for prevention and treatment of the virus infection (Vellingiri et al. (2020) ). Despite of the large number of cases worldwide (as shown in Fig. 2 (Statista (2020))) and low mortality rate ) compared to SARS and the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (as shown in Fig. 3 (Statista (2020))), this virus has high infectivity and transmissibility. Preventive measures for COVID-19 includes maintaining social distancing, washing hands frequently, avoiding touching the mouth, nose, and face (WHO (2020)). The first case of COVID-19 was reported in India on 30 th January 2020 with origin from China (PIB (2020)). It spreads to the maximum of districts of the country. As on 9 th April 2020 the total cases reported in India are 5734 with 472 recoveries and 166 deaths (Covid-19.in (2020) ).
