Depending on destination, studies indicate that the prevalence of travel-related illnesses among travelers can reach as high 80%.1\n,\n2 Furthermore, international travel has dramatically increased over the past decades, and international tourist arrivals alone reached 1.2 billion in 2015, with increased numbers of traveler to destinations outside of Europe and North America.3 Recent economic and popular trends have also led to an expanding range of travelers beyond business travelers, tourists, and aid workers, including budget travelers, study abroad students, medical tourists, and travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFR). VFR travelers are those returning to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives, and as a group they tend to be at increased risk of severe travel-related infections.4 The increase of international travel has also included those with special needs or medically complex travelers, including elderly, pediatric, pregnant, and immunocompromised travelers.4\n,\n5 While well-known tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue, and enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fevers) continue to be encountered in travelers, itineraries outside of traditional destinations and novel exposures presents providers with an increasing range of infections. Emerging infections and outbreaks further expand the infectious possibilities, and several recent epidemics including Zika, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been notable for their rapid international spread.6, 7, 8\n",

Travel-related infections typically present with nonspecific symptoms, and while the majority are not severe and even self-limiting, others can be of high-consequence and require urgent treatment or enhanced infection control. Relying on diagnostic intuition based on local clinical experience can therefore be dangerous in returned travelers. For example, while the common causes of fever in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients in North America are typically non-life threatening, febrile travelers who have returned from tropical areas may have malaria. High-consequence infections that should not be missed include malaria and other potentially clinically severe infections (e.g. enteric fever, dengue fever, leptospirosis, melioidosis, tick-borne infections, and rickettsial infections) and infections of major public health importance such as viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), MERS, and anthrax. Nosocomial outbreaks of EVD in the U.S. and MERS in South Korea have demonstrated how these infections can present serious risk when unsuspected in healthcare settings.6, 7 Furthermore, co-infections can occur and providers should consider this possibility, particularly when the patient is not responding appropriately to treatment of a confirmed infection,9, 10\n",

            "text": "Given the wide differential diagnosis for travel-related infections, consideration of the endemic causes of major infectious syndromes in the region of travel can guide the initial approach. Common syndromes include acute undifferentiated fevers, respiratory infections, acute gastrointestinal illness (including diarrhea and hepatitis), chronic gastrointestinal illness, central nervous system infections (e.g. meningitis or encephalitis), dermatologic complaints, and eosinophilia. Although patients might have illness that include multiple syndromes (e.g. fever and eosinophilia), a syndromic approach can help direct the differential diagnosis. Table 1\nlists infectious causes of febrile syndromes with relatively short incubation periods that may present in the first 2 weeks after travel. Surveillance data of sick returned travelers from systems such as GeoSentinel Surveillance can also be helpful in identifying the most commonly reported causes of illness in travelers returning from specific geographic regions (Table 2\n).10 For example, dengue is the most confirmed infection among febrile travelers returning from the Caribbean, while malaria is less likely (unless they had traveled to Haiti or the Dominican Republic, the only areas with malaria transmission in the Caribbean). On the other hand, Plasmodium falciparum is most frequently identified among returned febrile travelers from Sub-Saharan Africa, and four of 28 deaths reported in GeoSentinel from 2007 to 2011 were due to P. falciparum from this region. GeoSentinel surveillance data have notable limitations, especially the absence of denominators to calculate rates of infections among travelers, and a general bias towards illnesses that cause patients to seek care. However, the relative proportions of different etiologies in each region is helpful in predicting more likely pathogens.",

On the other hand, the minimum incubation period of malaria is seven days, and a traveler becoming febrile immediately after a weekend trip to an endemic area can be essentially ruled out for malarial fevers, assuming no previous exposure risk. Caution must be taken when ruling out infections based on travel timing alone, as travelers often do not recall exact travel dates, and itineraries can be complicated by transit stops.

However, for acute travelers\u2019 diarrhea, which is often self-limiting or empirically treated, results from conventional stool cultures are typically not available soon enough to guide management. Stool assays for Clostridium difficile toxins should be considered in travelers with diarrhea when there is a history of antibiotic use, since travel-associated C. difficile infection is increasingly described in travelers.19 Stool microscopy for ova and parasites, as well as specific protozoa antigen tests such as those for Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica, are often performed in returned sick travelers. While these can be useful for patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, their utility in the returned traveler with acute severe illness is limited since most gastrointestinal parasites are unlikely causes of acute febrile illness. Although acute schistosomiasis syndrome (Katayama fever) and amoebic liver abscess are classic causes of fever in the returned traveler, microscopy of stool (and urine for Schistosoma haematobium) is insensitive for these conditions.20\n,\n21\n",
