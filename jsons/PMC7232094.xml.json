Following the provision of informed consent (including parental consent for those <18 years), participants were asked to provide contact details and baseline demographic information, alongside completion of baseline measures. Following this, the induction session involved the provision of unique login details and a tour of the Entourage platform, alongside prompting participants to complete an initial \u201cstrengths survey\u201d to identify and tailor therapy content suggestions (described below). Participants were reimbursed AUD$30 for their time, and were free to use the Entourage platform on a self-directed basis until the conclusion of the 12-week intervention period. Following this, participants were invited to an in-person post-treatment assessment. This involved completion of the same quantitative survey completed at baseline, alongside a brief survey evaluating participant feedback on their experience, and a semi-structured interview comprising questions evaluating the intervention (qualitative results to be reported in future). All participants were recruited over a 7-month period from November 2018\u2013May 2019. The study intervention period concluded at the end of July 2019.

This is an online platform developed by a multi-disciplinary team, in partnership with young people experiencing mental health problems. Originally developed for young people with psychosis (Lederman et al., 2014), the iteration of MOST applied in Entourage integrates a number of features designed to improve social connection in young people with mental ill-health, and is described in detail elsewhere (Rice et al., 2019). In brief, Entourage incorporates online social networking with a \u201cWall\u201d feature where participants can \u201cpost\u201d and interact with others, similar to other social networking sites. Entourage also includes interactive psychosocial interventions, delivered in the form of bespoke therapy comics. Therapy modules are delivered in individual \u201cSteps\u201d, each targeting a particular aspect of cognitive therapy for social anxiety (such as psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, reducing safety behaviours, etc.). Each step also includes a \u201cTalking Point\u201d where young people are prompted to discuss the symptoms depicted in the comic with each other. \u201cActions\u201d also accompany therapy steps, which serve as behavioural tasks participants can implement in the real world to improve social functioning. Finally, Entourage incorporates a \u201cTalk it Out\u201d feature, where users can post unique challenges relating to their symptom experience, which moderators then support through a problem-solving style discussion, designed to help users assist others and learn from shared challenges. The therapy content is individually-tailored to each participant by clinical moderators who can suggest specific content based on individual users' treatment needs and goals.",

            "text": "To support progressive engagement with therapeutic modules, Entourage applied system moderation from expert youth mental health clinicians with significant experience treating mental health concerns in young people. Clinical moderators were trained according to a manualised theory-driven model designed to address key cognitive and behavioural factors known to maintain social anxiety (Clark and Wells, 1995; Rapee and Heimberg, 1997); informed by recommendations for improving system engagement (Arnold et al., 2019; Mohr et al., 2011). Gender-sensitised moderation strategies were also incorporated based on established literature, to boost engagement with the platform among young males (Englar-Carlson and Kiselica, 2013; Seidler et al., 2018). These included solution-focused questioning; applying an action-orientation and structured therapy designed to reach a clear solution; use of accessible language and minimising jargon; and normalizing the experience of mental ill-health among young male participants. Alongside this, young people with a lived experience of social anxiety provided online peer support on Entourage, to help users feel comfortable contributing to the platform and maintain engagement. This was incorporated given the growing body of literature highlighting the benefits of peer support to young people experiencing mental illness (Alvarez-Jimenez et al., 2016). Peer support workers were required to use the system at least twice per week for one month and to complete all therapy modules prior to commencing their role on Entourage. In addition, peer workers completed a one-day workshop of training specific to providing peer support in an online environment.",

Means and SDs were evaluated and paired sample t-tests were conducted to examine pre-post changes. Within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated. The Reliable Change Index (RCI) was employed to determine whether the change in individual scores between baseline and post-treatment was reliable and statistically significant (Jacobson and Truax, 1991). The RCI for each individual across measures was computed by dividing the difference between pre- and post-treatment scores by the standard error of the difference, and only computed using cases where full data was provided (Jacobson and Truax, 1991). An RCI equal or >1.645 (cut-off score typically used in clinical research; Bowden, 2017) indicates that the individual's change score is significantly greater than expected if due to random measurement error. Exploratory non-parametric (Spearman's rho) were examined for the LSAS in relation to background treatment received and indices of system usage. Multiple imputation was used to impute data for the small amount of missing cases determined to be missing completely at random for participants who completed both baseline and post-treatment assessment (see Supplementary Table 5).",

Exploratory analyses indicated that at the total sample level, Entourage was associated with improved outcomes for a number of clinical and social variables impacted by social anxiety symptoms and was not associated with any harm to young people. Entourage also represents an innovative approach to boosting social connection among young males, which represents promising progress given past evidence of lower engagement with digital interventions among this group (Clarke et al., 2015; El Alaoui et al., 2015). While young males improved reliably on slightly fewer measures than non-males, male participants appeared to engage just as well with the intervention according to usage statistics and retention rates. A number of factors may have contributed to this; namely gender-sensitised moderation strategies, anonymity and immediacy of access to therapeutic content, in line with past evidence of the effectiveness of such techniques in helping young males engage with mental health support (Seidler et al., 2018).",

While we did not meet the initial acceptability criterion, it is possible that a login count is not an ideal indicator of acceptability for young people with social anxiety, as participants reported universally positive feedback on aspects of the site such as therapy content and safety. This indicates that the a priori acceptability criteria may have been too strict, particularly given the assumption that more logins by participants automatically results in more positive clinical outcomes. Participant feedback indicated that 98.6% of participants would recommend Entourage to another young person experiencing social anxiety. Therefore, perhaps a significant proportion of participants experienced increased social connectedness from being part of the intervention, which may have been independent from frequency of logins. In line with this, Smith et al. (2017) previously found evidence to suggest that more logins on a platform does not always equate to more positive outcomes. They suggest that while treatment adherence is important, there may not be a \u2018set\u2019 dose for each individual to experience positive benefit, which may have been the case in Entourage.

This could be explained by evidence that young people with social anxiety tend to engage with social networking systems in unique ways. Shaw et al.

Past scholarship around \u201clurking\u201d could explain why participants did not post or interact extensively in \u2018the Caf\u00e9\u2019, as social anxiety around public speaking tends to extend to online spaces (Bonetti et al., 2010). As mentioned earlier, given largely positive feedback was received, perhaps participants experienced improved connectedness in being a part of Entourage, without necessarily needing to post frequently in the social networking space (Valentine et al., in press).",

The retention rate of 85% observed here, alongside the achieved sample size of 89 young people, both compare favourably to past CBT-derived digital interventions for social anxiety, where small sample sizes and participant attrition are common limitations (Sportel et al., 2013; Kampmann et al., 2016). A number of strategies may have assisted recruitment success and minimization of attrition, such as scheduling research assessments before or after participants' therapy sessions, or allowing initial screening via SMS given the preference for SMS contact over phone calls among youth with social anxiety (Reid and Reid, 2007). Regarding safety, the achievement of safety criterion indicated that a sufficiently supportive online community was established, that did not lead to any adverse events or deterioration in symptoms attributable to the intervention itself. This may have been expected due to participants being recruited from headspace early-intervention services in which support and monitoring is also provided by their regular mental health clinicians. Nevertheless, a large proportion of the study sample experienced suicidal ideation at baseline and throughout the study, so meeting safety indicators is an encouraging result.",

This may have been because participants found it less daunting to contribute to the \u201cTalking Point\u201d discussions, as these were prompted, and involved discussions about the shared experience of the particular presenting symptom depicted in the Step rather than spontaneously posting content in the more \u2018public\u2019 newsfeed section. Indeed, Naslund et al. (2016) have highlighted the increasing utility of online forums where young people can discuss shared symptoms of mental ill-health. This engagement may have been facilitated by the application of graphic medicine, as comics depicting medical narrative are known to facilitate a sense of solidarity among individuals experiencing adverse symptoms (McNicol, 2017). Furthermore, participants in Entourage engaged well with the \u201cTalk it Out\u201d feature \u2013 suggesting this novel opportunity to understand how other young people manage their symptoms was appealing to young people and potentially contributed to the sense of supportive community that was achieved.

In a meta-analysis conducted by Grist et al. (2019), four studies were reported that delivered an online intervention specifically targeting SAD in young people, with effect sizes ranging from 0.11 to 1.23. In an Australian study using the most similar intervention design to the current study, Spence et al. (2017) found that social anxiety symptoms were improved with an effect size of 0.70, which aligned closely with our results which showed an overall effect size of d = 0.73 for social anxiety symptoms with 48.3% of participants experiencing reliable improvement. There was some variability in effect sizes for the different measures of social anxiety included, which could be explained by variation in the specific symptoms assessed by each measure. For example, where the LSAS measures general fear or avoidance of social situations (Liebowitz, 1987), the BFNE scale specifically measures concern regarding negative judgment from others, without reference to specific situations (Leary, 1983). Given the comics presented in Entourage typically involved depiction of specific social situations, it could be that the therapy content had a greater effect on more general fear or avoidance of these situations, potentially explaining the difference in effect size observed between the LSAS and BFNE. Considering the wide range of effect sizes reported by other studies evaluating digital interventions for social anxiety, and variation in intervention design and implementation, the current study's results fit conservatively within the current literature (Grist et al., 2019; Kampmann et al., 2016).",

This is promising given social disconnection is a common feature among socially anxious young people, and loneliness can maintain social anxiety symptoms over time (Lim et al., 2016). The holistic approach to digital therapy for social anxiety symptoms used in Entourage appears a viable approach to not only symptom reduction, but simultaneously boosting social connection. It is also noteworthy that symptoms of depression reduced across the intervention period, alongside a significant reduction in participants' perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. While we cannot make any casual inferences because of the uncontrolled nature of the study and the concomitant background treatment, this is nevertheless an encouraging finding particularly given these factors are key markers of suicide risk in young people (Barzilay et al., 2015). Interpersonal difficulties are also thought to, at least in part, explain higher rates of suicidality among young people with social anxiety (Buckner et al., 2017). Additionally, a meta-analysis of the association between perceived social support and depression in childhood and adolescence has highlighted that perceived social support, even without treatment, can alleviate depressive symptoms in youth (Rueger et al., 2016). The social support afforded by Entourage may therefore have had a positive influence on the affective symptoms of participants. Future controlled studies should aim to uncover the specific mechanisms underlying both the social and clinical benefits of a system like Entourage for youth with social anxiety.",

The uncontrolled design of the study also means that changes in clinical and social measures cannot be attributed to Entourage alone. Additionally, information regarding participants' stage of in-person treatment when Entourage commenced was not recorded. This represents a limitation as participants nearing completion of an episode of care may have experienced different outcomes from those closer to the commencement of treatment. The number of sessions completed while participants used Entourage was nevertheless unrelated to decline in social anxiety symptoms, lending support for the positive results observed. Furthermore, participants recruited for the intervention were already seeking psychological support from headspace early intervention services. This makes the generalisation of Entourage to the wider non-help seeking population of young people with social anxiety unknown, as those attending headspace may have been more inclined to use Entourage than the general population. However, there is evidence that online forums for young people to discuss mental ill-health and support others are beneficial, highlighting that uptake may also be higher from the general population of young people with social anxiety (Naslund et al., 2016; Nicholas et al., 2004).",

Suicide prevention research has implicated the potential harm social media can have on young people in terms of normalizing suicide behaviours, triggering maladaptive behaviour in others and cyber-bullying (Hawton et al., 2019). Conversely, the authors also highlight the potential benefit of social media to deliver crisis support, provide a sense of connection to young people, deliver therapy and reach isolated groups (Hawton et al., 2019). These important considerations were addressed in the design of the Entourage intervention by requiring participants to be accessing services at their respective headspace centres in order to maintain clinical oversight, as well as via safety features embedded within the intervention to detect distress, provide support and provide support where necessary. Many current digital interventions do not require the individual to be conjunctively accessing in-person support, so future studies should seek to maximize the benefits to social connection afforded by social media-based interventions for social anxiety. This could be achieved by refining and expanding features that achieved engagement from young people in Entourage (such as Talking Points), alongside refining peer moderation, as this demonstrated promise in this study.",

This requirement nevertheless restricts the extent to which these results can be generalised to socially-anxious youth who may not be seeking in-person treatment. Entourage was not developed with the intention of being a stand-alone support service, with the idea being that socially anxious young people may benefit from targeted adjunct support. The results of the present study do however lend support to the idea of a dedicated, online peer support service for young people experiencing social anxiety while they wait for more intensive in-person support. The demand for community mental health services for young people in Australia is high, with young people commonly needing to wait several weeks for an appointment to be available (Rickwood et al., 2015). A system like Entourage could therefore provide first stage support to young people, particularly given Entourage allows immediate access to evidence-based therapy modules. Important considerations would include the refinements of peer support and moderation strategies in order to cater for high numbers of young people accessing the service. Given many young people with social anxiety never access treatment (Crome et al., 2015), ensuring adequate timely support is provided to those that do seek help is paramount. Evidence for the feasibility and safety of Entourage suggests it provides a potentially viable application to address this need.",

Indeed, a recent systematic review of apps for social anxiety demonstrated that no other service currently available offers the same level of integrated functionality designed to specifically target social anxiety (Alyami et al., 2017). Entourage demonstrated promising acceptability, feasibility and safety, with encouraging, albeit uncontrolled benefits to clinical and social variables. Entourage also represents a promising step forward in the design of targeted interventions to boost health service engagement among young men.",
