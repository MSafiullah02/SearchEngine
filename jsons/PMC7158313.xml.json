Supernumerary lobes are relatively frequent findings, particularly on the inferior surface of the liver. They are connected to the liver by hepatic tissue or by a mesentery containing branches of the portal vein, hepatic vein and hepatic artery, and a bile duct.21 Intrathoracic accessory lobes, with their vascular supply perforating the diaphragm, have been reported.22 Accessory lobes may rarely require surgical intervention because of their large size, torsion of a pedicle, or the presence of other associated defects.23 Pedunculated hepatocellular carcinoma may arise in accessory lobes.",

The fusion is unilateral and is not associated with clinical evidence of adrenal impairment. It was found in 9.9% of unselected autopsy cases in one study.36 The incidence was much higher in older age groups suggesting that the condition may be an ageing phenomenon.

Experimental evidence in support of occlusion of the portal vein and the subsequent opening up of adjacent collateral vessels has been reported by Williams and Johnston.98 In a prospective ultrasonographic evaluation of neonates undergoing umbilical catheterization, portal vein thrombosis was detected in 56% of the patients of whom 20% went on to partial or complete resolution.99 Although not all cases of cavernous transformation have a history of umbilical catheterization, such a procedure, especially when catheter use is prolonged, seems to account for a significant number of cases. Conversely, congenital abnormalities, in particular atrial septal defects, malformations of the biliary tract, and anomalous inferior vena cava, have been observed in 12 of 30 cases studied by Odi\u00e8vre et al.100 Several cases of cavernous transformation have also been found associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis.101, 102 It would appear that in some cases an anatomical anomaly of the portal vein may underpin the thrombotic process. The rapidly changing haemodynamics occurring during birth in regard to the portal circulation may play an additional role.",

The condition is frequently reported from Japan and South Africa.105, 106, 107, 108 Patients present with the Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome and are prone to develop hepatocellular carcinoma.106 Membranous obstruction of the vena cava occurs mainly in adults but a series of nine cases in children was reported from Namibia.109 Rare instances of congenital Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome, attributed to maternal drug use110 or ingestion of herbal tea111 or idiopathic,112, 113 have been reported. Veno-occlusive disease in children with cellular and humoral immune deficiency has also been described.114 In the cases of Mellis and Bale, consanguinity and early age of onset suggested an inherited cause for the veno-occlusive disease.115\n",

The estimated frequency ranges from 1 to 20 per 100 000.117 Mutations in the genes encoding endoglin (ENG, chromosome 9q34),118 and activin receptor type-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1 or ALK-1, chromosome 12q13),119, 120 both of which mediate signalling by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 ligands in vascular endothelial cells, are associated with HHT1 and HHT2 subtypes, respectively. Mutations in the gene MADH4 encoding SMAD4, an important member of the TGF\u03b2 pathway, are seen in patients with the combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT and should be tested for in HHT patients found negative for ENG and ALK-1 mutations as they are bound to have undiagnosed juvenile polyposis.121 A fourth putative HHT gene has been localized to chromosome 5.122 The disease is characterized by telangiectases (skin, mucous membranes), arteriovenous fistulas in the liver (30% of cases), lungs and central nervous system, and aneurysms. Hepatic involvement is characterized clinically by pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and a large, sometimes pulsatile, liver. High-output cardiac failure may result from arteriovenous shunting in the liver.123, 124 Portal hypertension and encephalopathy may occur.125 Intrahepatic lithiasis is a rare complication.126\n",

Microscopically, three fibrovascular patterns were reported by Daly and Schiller.134 One pattern comprises a honeycomb meshwork of dilated sinusoidal channels lined by endothelial cells set either directly upon hepatocyte cords or amid a loose fibrous stroma (Fig. 3.3A\n); the distribution of these foci is haphazard. A second pattern consists of tortuous thick-walled veins flanked by numerous wide-calibre arteries that course randomly through the parenchyma amid variable amounts of fibrous tissue. A third pattern is evident in the enlarged portal areas in which numerous dilated vessels (veins, arteries and lymphatics) show prominently against a background of fibrous tissue (Fig. 3.3B). Regenerative nodules (nodular transformation) were described in the cases reported by Zelman135 and Wanless and Gryfe.136 A high prevalence of focal nodular hyperplasia has been detected by Doppler ultrasonography.137 Blewitt et al.138 described marked disruption of the hepatic architecture with hepatocyte necrosis and ischaemic bile duct injury in a patient with HHT and intra-abdominal sepsis. One woman treated with ethinyl oestradiol, multiple blood transfusions and iron dextran developed hepatocellular carcinoma.139 Mouse models have been reported for the two main genomic mutations with histological changes recapitulating those observed in man.140, 141, 142\n",

            "text": "Approximately 30% of infants presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the neonatal period have biliary atresia (BA), the overall incidence being approximately 1 in 6000 to 1 in 19 000 live births.189, 190, 191, 192 There is no clear-cut racial predilection although some ethnicities appear to have a higher incidence: African-Americans193 and Polynesians189 compared with Caucasian infants. BA is more common in girls than boys.46, 191 Seasonal variation in the occurrence of this disease has been suggested in North American studies,193, 194 although this pattern has not been confirmed in Europe189 or Japan.195 Unquestionably, there are multiple disease mechanisms which can produce BA since it rather than BA may occur as an isolated lesion or in association with various types of congenital structural abnormalities or specific chromosomal abnormalities. It can be conceptually useful to classify BA in two general patterns: \u2018early\u2019 or embryonal/fetal accounting for 15\u201335% of cases and \u2018late\u2019 or generally perinatal (acquired) in 65\u201385% of cases. This aetiopathogenic heterogeneity of BA was delineated by a study of 237 children by Silveira et al.11 Forty-seven of the children (20%) had associated congenital anomalies (28 cardiovascular, 22 digestive and 19 splenic). The splenic malformations included 13 with polysplenia syndrome and two with asplenia. Karyotypic abnormalities were found in two of eight children studied. Silveira et al. divided BA into four distinct subgroups, three involving a congenital form that could arise through a malformation, a disruption or a chromosomal abnormality, while the fourth is attributable to agents active in the perinatal period (the acquired form).11 Most infants have this \u2018late\u2019 acquired pattern: their apparently normal biliary system has been subjected to a fibrosing inflammatory process toward the end of gestation or shortly after birth. Discordance for BA in HLA identical twins supports a postnatal event being of primary importance in the pathogenesis of late-pattern BA.196 By contrast, approximately 10\u201330% of infants with BA have extrahepatic congenital abnormalities such as polysplenia, left atrial isomerism, double-sided left lung, pre-duodenal portal vein, intestinal malrotation, and/or congenital heart defects.46, 197, 198 These congenital defects are sometimes grouped as a \u2018laterality complex\u2019. Abnormalities of the spleen are not invariably present in infants who have other typical features of the laterality complex, and thus splenic disorder does not define this association.199 A subset of infants with BA, comprising 6\u201310% of patients overall, have damage to the biliary tree which produces cystic dilatation200, 201, 202; most of these patients seem to have a choledochal cyst, but exceptionally the cystic change is confined to intrahepatic ducts. This type of BA, now termed cystic BA (formerly called \u2018correctable\u2019 BA), may be identified on sonography of the fetus in approximately 40% of cases.202 It may represent yet another disease mechanism for BA, distinct from those represented by early- and late-pattern BA, although cystic BA has been identified in patients with early-pattern (fetal/embryonal) BA. Some infants with BA have specific chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 17\u201318,203 Turner syndrome,204 or cat-eye syndrome.205 A lethal autosomal recessive syndrome with intra-uterine growth retardation, intra- and extrahepatic BA, and oesophageal and duodenal atresia was reported in one family.206 BA has been reported with the Kabuki make-up syndrome,207 in one patient with Zimmermann\u2013Laband syndrome and brachydactyly,208 and in Martinas\u2013Frias syndrome.209 Other genetic disorders may be associated with BA as familial occurrence has been reported,210, 211 and in one case a woman who had had BA gave birth to a daughter with BA.212\n",

Chance occurrence of a viral infection during a limited period of susceptibility would explain the rarity of BA; however, no consensus exists as to which viruses are pre-eminent in such an aetiopathogenesis and some recent observations suggest that viral infection is a secondary phenomenon.213 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is found in a high proportion of children with BA. Tarr et al.214 found evidence for viral infection in five of 23 patients with BA. The diagnosis was based on histopathological evidence of CMV infection, serology (IgM antibodies) or culture. The detection of CMV infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is higher in neonatal hepatitis than in BA.215 In a set of identical twins both infected with CMV, one twin had BA and the other had neonatal hepatitis.216 Infants with BA and concurrent CMV infection may have a worse prognosis.217 Reovirus 3 was suggested as a cause of BA and neonatal hepatitis on the basis of clinical and experimental studies218, 219, 220, 221 but that association was questioned by other investigators.222, 223 More compelling evidence for an aetiological association of BA and reoviruses was provided by Tyler et al.224 These investigators detected reovirus RNA from hepatobiliary tissues of 55% of patients with BA and 78% of patients with choledochal cysts. A possible relationship between group C rotavirus and BA was suggested by Riepenhoff-Talty et al.225 Subsequently, however, no evidence of group A, B or C rotaviruses was detected by PCR in BA.226 Human papilloma virus has been detected in neonatal hepatitis and BA by nested PCR for DNA,227 but the role, if any, of this virus needs to be clarified.",

            "text": "Recent progress has focused on immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of BA, especially late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA.228, 229 The envisioned disease mechanism is that during the perinatal period a viral infection occurs and it targets the biliary epithelium and provokes an aberrant autoimmune injury to the bile ducts which persists long after the viral infection is gone. This proposed mechanism entails an active, ongoing immune response which can be documented empirically, and it accounts for the conflicting reports of viral infection in BA as well as the absence of detectable ongoing viral infection in liver or biliary tissue from BA patients. The hepatic inflammatory infiltrate in BA was found remarkable for evidence of lymphocyte activation.230 Studies in liver tissue from infants with BA showed a Th1-type of cytokine expression pattern with CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages in portal tracts and increased IL-2, IL-12, interferon-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1.231 Determinants on the activated T cells are typical of an oligoclonal expansion, consistent with being evoked by a specific antigen.232 Upregulation of osteopontin expression in intrahepatic biliary epithelium correlated with portal fibrosis and ductular reaction.233 At the same time, genomic studies of liver from infants with BA have shown upregulation of genes involved in regulating lymphocyte differentiation, mainly of those with Th1-commitment.234 Upregulation of the expression of interferon-\u03b3 and osteopontin was notable. Another study, which included somewhat older patients, also found upregulation of genes involved in morphogenesis, cell signalling and regulation of gene transcription.235 Further studies suggested that the pattern of regulatory gene expression in late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA is not equivalent to that in the early-pattern; these data also failed to show a pattern relating to laterality genes in early-pattern (embryonic/fetal) BA.236 Both forms of BA appear to induce a strong immunological response. HLA studies in BA might support a disease mechanism involving autoimmunity, but results to date are contradictory. One early study showed that infants with late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA have a high prevalence of the HLA-B12 determinant compared both to normal controls and to infants with BA plus congenital anomalies;237 haplotypes A9-B5 and A28-B35 were more common in infants with late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA. A subsequent study failed to confirm any characteristic HLA pattern in BA.238 Yet additional studies have shown an association with HLA-DR2239 and with HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3.240 Further insight into the possible mechanism of late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA has come from recent work in the Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) murine model of BA. It can be simulated in Balb/c-mice which have been infected with rotavirus.241, 242 This model shares many features with the human disease. Interferon-\u03b3 plays an important role in bile duct damage: knockout mice not expressing interferon-\u03b3 failed to get severe duct damage after infection with RRV despite a brief hepatitis whereas wild type animals did; administration of recombinant interferon-\u03b3 abrogated the protective effect of not being able to produce interferon-\u03b3.243 Certain chemokines may also contribute to biliary damage;244 IL-12 seems to play a lesser role;245 tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 appears not to be involved.246 In this mouse model, primed neonatal CD8 T-cells appear capable of initiating damage to bile ducts.247 When T cells from RRV-disease mice were transferred into naive syngeneic SCID mice, the recipients developed bile duct-specific inflammation without previous RRV infection.248 Some autoantibodies have been detected in this model (directed to \u03b1-enolase or vimentin).249 Thus the combination of observations in infants with BA and in this mouse model strongly suggests that a complex pattern of immune reactivity appears to be important in late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA. In the early-pattern (embryonic/fetal) form, other genes may play a more direct role.",

            "text": "Other theories have been proposed for the pathogenesis of BA. Landing250 first proposed that neonatal hepatitis, biliary atresia, infantile choledochal cyst and possibly some instances of \u2018intrahepatic biliary atresia\u2019 (meaning congenital duct paucity syndromes) are all manifestations of a single basic disease process that he named \u2018infantile obstructive cholangiopathy\u2019. He considered biliary atresia (and choledochal cyst) to be the result of an inflammatory rather than a maldevelopmental process and postulated that the most probable cause was a viral infection. Since the aetiopathogenesis of an important congenital bile duct paucity syndrome, namely Alagille syndrome, has since been elucidated as genetic, this theory clearly requires modification. Nevertheless, as previously discussed, the role of viral infection at least in the pathogenesis of late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA is an important focus of current research. Certain chromosomal abnormalities may give rise to complex syndromes including altered immune reactivity and thus predispose to hepatobiliary disease mediated by viral infection. Microchimerism has recently been proposed as part of the mechanism of hepatobiliary damage in BA;251 it might initiate an immune response in the absence of viral infection. The various manifestations of infantile obstructive cholangiopathy may depend on the timing of the insult. Specifically, rats given the drug 1,4-phenylenediiso-thiocyanate during fetal life developed stenotic or atretic bile ducts due to thickening and fibrosis, whereas those given the drug after birth had dilatation of the ducts with inflammation.252 It is difficult to generalize from this rat model to human infants. BA with features of the ductal plate malformation might reflect a different disease mechanism.253 Recent observations, however, have argued against the presence of ductal plate malformation in BA as unique to patients with early-pattern (embryonic/fetal) BA.254\n",

            "text": "Whereas the pathogenesis of the late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA probably involves immunogenetic susceptibility and exposure to an instigating factor, such as viral infection, during a limited period of susceptibility, the aetiopathogenesis of the early-pattern (embryonal/fetal) BA appears to be much more diverse. Extrahepatic congenital abnormalities such as polysplenia, congenital heart defects, and disturbed rotation of the intestines suggest an extensive and early developmental abnormality. Some infants with BA and these extrahepatic findings show features of the ductal plate lesion on liver biopsy.253, 255, 256 This abnormal configuration of small bile ducts is attributed to disorganization in the fetal development of the biliary tree: failure of remodelling of the ductal plate leads to residual embryonic bile duct structures in this rather striking configuration. Finding the ductal plate lesion in extrahepatic biliary atresia is consistent with a destructive hepatobiliary process beginning early in gestation. Abnormal cilia have been reported in children with the polysplenia syndrome and BA.257, 258 While the association with abnormal cilia is unclear, ciliary function appears to be important in left/right asymmetry.259 There is a pathogenic role for multiple defects in the laterality sequence.260 Early studies focused on the inversion (inv) gene, one of three genes that control left/right asymmetry in the mouse.261 Beginning in early embryonic development the liver is a predominant site for this gene expression. A transgenic mouse with recessive deletion of inv develops situs inversus and jaundice; the early fetal lesion is a complete obstruction with cystic change of the biliary tree.262 Few of the various genes which have been found mutated in human laterality disorders (ZIC3, CFC1, LEFTYA, ACVR2B, NODAL) have been investigated in BA; however, mutations in CFC1\n263 and ZIC3\n264 have been found in infants with BA and major laterality defects. Three children were described with ultrastructural abnormalities of the canalicular microvilli and no expression of villin; phenotypically they had BA without laterality complex or ductal plate malformation.265\n",

Indeed in many infants jaundice is initially physiological and merges with the jaundice of advancing liver disease. Infants typically have dark urine and pale stools, but the stools may retain enough colour to be falsely reassuring. The infants look well and generally gain weight adequately. At clinical presentation they have hepatomegaly and usually some degree of splenomegaly, unless polysplenia is present. The infant who presents with congenital heart disease and conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia requires intensive evaluation since the leading hepatic diagnoses will be BA or Alagille syndrome.

Although hepatobiliary scanning has high sensitivity, scanning may appear normal if performed very early in the disease process in late-pattern BA.269, 270 Hepatobiliary scanning is informative if it shows that tracer, and thus bile, reaches the intestine; it is objective, recorded, and can be quantified. A negative or non-draining scan does not mean that the disorder is necessarily BA because non-draining hepatobiliary scans may be found with severe idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, small duct paucity syndromes, such as Alagille syndrome, with severe \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency or with TPN-associated cholestasis. The role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains controversial: ERCP is technically feasible in infants and may be useful in selected cases.271, 272, 273 Percutaneous liver biopsy is essential and has high diagnostic specificity in the range of 60\u201395%, depending on the timing of the biopsy, adequacy of the specimen and expertise of the pathologist.274, 275 In our experience, the majority of non-diagnostic biopsy specimens are taken within the first few weeks of life. In fact incidental liver biopsy specimens taken at laparotomy for duodenal stricture within the first week of life in three infants with BA showed only trivial liver abnormalities.276 This may imply that although bile duct destruction is likely to have started in utero, the actual liver damage may not occur until the placenta discontinue the clearance of biliary products, in particular bile salts.",

            "text": "Portoenterostomy (the Kasai procedure) was introduced in 1959 and remains the only potentially corrective procedure, other than liver transplantation.277 In this operation, the atretic biliary tree is resected, and bile drainage is re-established via a broad anastomosis of the end of an intestinal Roux-en-Y loop to the bare edge of the transected porta hepatis. The efficacy of the recently introduced laparoscopic version of the Kasai portoenterostomy currently remains uncertain. Extensive retrospective studies have shown that the prognosis for a good long-term result from the conventional Kasai procedure depends primarily on operation before 60 days of age and the absence of cholangitis,191, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283 but there is potential for reasonable medium-term survival in about one-third of infants coming to primary corrective surgery 100 days or older. Most centres continue to favour the Kasai procedure as the first therapeutic option, rather than subjecting patients to immediate liver transplantation simply on the basis of age.284 The lack of significant fibrosis at the time of operation may play a role in a good long-term outcome.285 Computerized quantification of fibrosis on liver biopsy obtained at Kasai portoenterostomy may discriminate between negligible fibrosis and sufficient fibrosis to portend a bad prognosis.286 One group suggested that histological features on the initial liver biopsy specimen can predict the success of portoenterostomy.287 Another group reported that the extent of ductular reaction, based on keratin 7 (K7) immunostaining, found in the liver biopsy specimen obtained at the time of Kasai procedure was predictive of native liver survival over the following year.288 Histological studies of the extrahepatic bile ducts removed at surgery have been performed by several groups of investigators.289, 290, 291, 292, 293 In a study of 98 cases, Gautier and Eliot classified the biliary remnants into three types: in the first the duct is completely atretic, with few or no inflammatory cells in the surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 3.6A\n); in the second type it is present as a cleft-like lumen lined by occasional cuboidal or low columnar epithelium which is variably necrotic, hyperplastic, or focally absent (Fig. 3.6B,C); the altered ducts are sometimes very numerous, usually having lumina of <50 \u00b5m, periluminal neutrophilic infiltration is characteristic and cellular debris, and less often bile, may be found in the lumen. Epithelial necrosis is evident in ducts with a diameter exceeding 300 \u00b5m. The third type consists of altered bile duct incompletely lined by columnar epithelium, in addition to numerous smaller epithelial structures (Fig. 3.6D). These histological types were evaluated by Gautier et al.291 at three levels \u2013 porta hepatis, junction of the cystic and common hepatic ducts and an intermediate level; completely atretic duct becomes increasingly more frequent from the porta hepatis to the junction of the hepatic duct and cystic ducts. This classification, which may help pathologists to describe the changes observed in the biliary remnants removed at portoenterostomy, is of limited clinical significance because in individual cases serial sectioning often shows atretic ducts alternating with variably destroyed ducts in a random fashion. In addition the numerous smaller structures intermingled with variably altered ducts are likely to represent anastomosing channels recruited from peribiliary glands, of which effectiveness in bypassing the atretic duct is uncertain; anastomoses between ramified peribiliary glands are well demonstrated in normal adult livers using injection techniques (see Chapter 10). Correlations between the size and number of residual ducts and establishment of bile flow after surgery have yielded conflicting results. Two groups of investigators believed that bile flow is most likely to occur when the diameter of the residual ducts exceeds 150 \u00b5m.278, 289, 294 However, another study of the extrahepatic biliary remnants of 204 cases of BA showed that the patterns of bile duct obliteration are not indicative of prognosis.293\n",

Survival in BA with a functioning Kasai portoenterostomy but without orthotopic liver transplantation is 10\u201320% by the age of 20 years.296 In a recent survey of 271 patients, 23% were alive with their native liver 20 years after surgery, all but two having signs of cirrhosis; after age 20 years, two patients died of liver failure and 14 underwent, or were waiting for, a liver transplant. Women who are long-term survivors with BA and have not yet had a liver transplant may have normal pregnancies, but in general such pregnancies must be treated as high-risk because of complications from portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation.297 Liver transplantation has become the treatment of choice for infants and children in whom the Kasai portoenterostomy has failed. The safety and results of liver transplantation with the use of livers from living related donors and cadaveric donors are excellent. One-year survival is >90%, with better results obtained under elective conditions and in children who are over 10 kg in weight.296, 298 Recent data indicate that the overall survival at 10 years for all surgical treatment is of the order of 75\u201380%;191, 299 general health 10 years after paediatric liver transplantation is good, although renal impairment and cardiovascular disease may develop.300\n",

At first it is enlarged and dark green in colour, becoming finely nodular as cirrhosis develops (Fig. 3.7\n). In untreated cases, the cirrhosis may take between 1 and 6 months from birth to develop. Dilated bile ducts filled with inspissated bile may be seen in sections of large portal areas (Fig. 3.8\n). The cystically dilated bile ducts may resemble Caroli disease.301 They only occur after the age of 3 months and are not amenable to surgical drainage procedures. There may be portal lymphadenopathy. The median maximum node dimension in six cases studied by H\u00fcbscher and Harrison was 14 mm.302 These lymph nodes are brown in colour and full of pigment-laden macrophages. Livers removed at transplantation after an apparently successful Kasai procedure (loss of jaundice), but with subsequent development of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, are often coarsely nodular with areas of macronodular hypertrophy and broad intervening or peripherally located scars resembling the gross appearance of focal nodular hyperplasia (Fig. 3.9\n).",

            "text": "The histological features of BA include cholestasis, portal tract expansion by oedematous fibroplasia and periportal ductular reaction with the presence of bile plugs in dilated lumens of cholangioles that are distorted and often form an irregularly anastomosing network at the portal periphery (Figure 3.10, Figure 3.11\n). Arterial branches are unusually prominent and portal vein branches appear attenuated. Giant cell transformation of hepatocytes is seen in some cases (Fig. 3.12\n), and may occasionally be prominent. Loose fibrosis is progressive and periportal/perilobular in location, with linkage of portal areas and eventual development of a secondary biliary cirrhosis (Fig. 3.13\n). A study of the extracellular and cellular components of the connective tissue matrix in BA by de Freitas et al. suggested that activation of a connective tissue cellular clone by the reactive ductules may be responsible for the portal fibroplasia.303 Ho et al. reported an arteriopathy (hyperplasia and hypertrophy) of the common hepatic artery and its peripheral branches supplying the entire biliary tree in 11 cases of biliary atresia.304 Thickening of the medial layer of small hepatic arteries may be present.305 Subsequent studies have indicated that the transcription factor HNF6 plays an important role in intrahepatic bile duct and arterial development.306, 307 HNF6 and HNF1\u00df appear necessary for ductal plate formation.306 Large perihilar bile ducts may show ulceration with loss of epithelial lining, bile impregnation of the wall and bile sludge formation in the lumen. In addition to the severe cholestasis, the cirrhotic stage of BA is characterized by marked pseudo-xanthomatous transformation, the presence of bile lakes, Mallory\u2013Denk bodies and variable accumulation of copper and copper-associated protein in liver cells (Figure 3.14, Figure 3.15\n). In one study, copper concentrations were increased in over two-thirds of liver samples obtained during portoenterostomy and decreased in some patients after successful biliary drainage.308 However, copper deposition in liver is elevated in the first 2 months of life and periportal deposition of copper on liver biopsy specimens does not discriminate extra from intrahepatic causes of cholestasis in early infancy. Acute and chronic inflammation is noted in portal/periportal areas in BA in both pre-cirrhotic and cirrhotic stages, and bile duct degeneration and inflammation may be evident (Fig. 3.16\n). The mononuclear infiltrate in portal and lobular areas of livers with end-stage BA is similar to normal adult liver and very different from that associated with autoimmune hepatitis or chronic hepatitis B infection. The growth of large perihilar regenerative nodules, probably as a consequence of functioning intrahepatic ducts in this region, may be important for maintaining biliary drainage after Kasai procedure.309 Bile lakes occur after the age of 3 months, by which time irreversible hepatic damage has occurred.310\n",

Similar observations had been made earlier by Desmet and Callea,313 who hypothesized that this subgroup has more severe and rapidly progressive liver damage. It is of interest that children in this subgroup reveal a histopathological picture resembling that of congenital hepatic fibrosis 4 or 5 years after portoenterostomy313, 314 (Figure 3.18, Figure 3.19\n). The interlobular bile ducts continue to disappear and cirrhosis can develop despite satisfactory bile drainage after portoenterostomy. The bile duct loss has been attributed to persistent interference with bile flow,315 recurrent cholangitis or continuation of the immune process causing the atresia. Detailed histopathological study of sequential liver specimens taken at the time of Kasai operation, relaparotomy and/or transplantation has provided evidence that the bile duct loss is due to an unpredictable and uneven obliteration of bile ducts in the porta hepatis during wound healing and scarring after portoenterostomy.315\n",

            "text": "The pathological aspects of giant cell transformation, a frequent and often dominant finding in neonatal hepatitis, have been reviewed extensively.344, 345, 346 The change is seen throughout the parenchyma but it is often more marked in the perivenular areas. The giant cells contain four or more nuclei, sometimes as many as 40 per cell, have ill-defined outlines and may be detached from other cells in the hepatic plate (Figure 3.20, Figure 3.21\n). The cytoplasm of some giant cells may contain remnants of cell membranes. It is partially rarefied and often contains bile and/or haemosiderin. The cells may have more glycogen than normal hepatocytes and a greater activity of a variety of enzymes, such as glucose 6-phosphatase, acid phosphatase and succinic dehydrogenase. Death of the giant cells is associated with a neutrophilic inflammatory response (Fig. 3.22\n). In severe forms, extensive bridging cell loss may divide the parenchyma into micronodules which are highlighted by a reticulin stain (Fig. 3.23A,B\n). The number of giant cells decreases as patients grow older, and are rare after the age of 1 year. Formation of giant cells is considered to be a characteristic change resulting from mitotic inhibition of the young, growing liver tissue by a number of agents such as viruses, drugs, or hereditary abnormalities,347 or from dissolution of cell membranes, as suggested by Craig and Landing,348 who first described this entity. Negative nuclear staining for cell proliferation markers and the demonstration of canalicular remnants using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunostaining support a fusion of rosette-forming hepatocytes as the likely mechanism of giant cell formation.346\n",

The relevant finding is a reduction in the number of interlobular bile ducts, that is, in the small bile ducts with in portal tracts. The normal ratio of small bile ducts per portal tract in full-term infants, children and adults is 0.9\u20131.8 ducts per tract. In duct paucity syndromes this ratio is <0.5 given an adequate number of portal tracts (at least 10) examined on biopsy. Premature infants have a reduced number of small bile ducts per portal tract and if they have duct paucity with cholestasis, it may be physiological. In addition, it must be noted that early biopsy specimens in a few cases of clinically undisputed paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts have shown not only identifiable ducts, but significant ductular reaction. Liver disorders with paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts are generally divided into two groups: \u2018syndromic\u2019, which refers to Alagille syndrome (AGS or ALGS), and \u2018non-syndromic\u2019, which refers to all the rest of these diseases. The non-syndromic duct paucity conditions include numerous diseases where portal small duct paucity is associated with another identifiable disease. These include infection (congenital rubella or cytomegalovirus infection), immune abnormality (graft-versus-host disease, liver allograft chronic rejection), and hepatotoxicity (due to carbamazepine or amoxicillin-clavulinic acid),349 the latter two groups being generally referred to as ductopenia, formerly vanishing bile duct syndromes (see Chapters 10 and 15). Various inherited metabolic diseases such as Zellweger syndrome, \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, and inborn errors of bile acid metabolism (discussed in Chapter 4) may display paucity of the intrahepatic ducts. Chromosomal defects, such as 45XO Turner syndrome,350 trisomy 17\u201318, trisomy 21,351 and prune belly syndrome,352 may have duct paucity. More importantly, the term non-syndromic duct paucity may be used to refer to isolated, idiopathic paucity of interlobular bile ducts in infancy and childhood; this condition may be the same as idiopathic adulthood ductopenia. Finally, paucity of the intrahepatic ducts or ductopenia is frequently found as a late feature of certain chronic diseases such as biliary atresia, sclerosing cholangitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and primary biliary cirrhosis (Chapter 10).",

The vast majority of cases (ALGS1) are due to mutations in JAGGED1 (JAG1, encoding the ligand for the Notch 1 receptor) on chromosome 20p12359, 360 and may be associated with a macroscopic deletion of the short arm of chromosome 20 in some patients or microdeletions of 20p in others. The pattern of genetic transmission is autosomal dominant due to haploinsufficiency or dominant negative effect;360 gene penetrance is high but expression is extremely variable.361 The reported incidence of arteriohepatic dysplasia as 1 : 70 000 live births was an underestimate, and it is actually 1 : 30 000.358 Approximately 50\u201370% of patients have new mutations, rather than genetic transmission within the family. Crosnier et al.362 found mutations of the JAG1 gene in 69 of 109 patients (63%) with Alagille syndrome, and transmission analysis showed a high frequency of sporadic cases (70%).

Although the specificity of the facies has been questioned,364 it is accepted as a typical finding,365 better appreciated in the actual clinical setting than in photographs. The facies is sometimes not evident in the first months of life, and in adults the facies is somewhat different from that described in children (longer face, rather coarse features, prominent forehead, and comparatively small nose). Most patients have a systolic murmur related to stenosis of the pulmonary arterial system. More severe conditions include: tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary valve stenosis, aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous return, and complex problems involving a single right ventricle with pulmonary valve atresia.366, 367 Up to 15% of patients may have life-threatening cardiac complications.355 In addition to posterior embryotoxon or Axenfeld anomaly, abnormal retinal pigmentation may be found.368 Strabismus, ectopic pupil, and hypotrophic optic discs have also been reported. Optic disc drusen, which are calcified deposits in the extracellular space of the optic nerve head, occur commonly in Alagille syndrome. These can be found by ocular ultrasound examination and it may facilitate the diagnosis.369 Other skeletal abnormalities include short distal phalanges and clinodactyly.370, 371, 372\n",

Liver transplantation has been reserved for patients with chronic liver failure, intolerable pruritus unresponsive to medical treatment, and severe growth failure. Transplantation for hepatic decompensation was necessary in 19 of 92 cases (21%) with 79% alive 1 year post-transplantation; the mortality was 17%. In the Bic\u00eatre series of 163 patients followed over a 40-year period, 102 of 132 patients presenting with cholestatic jaundice in infancy remained jaundiced at the study endpoint, and one-third required liver transplantation; cirrhosis was found in some children with Alagille syndrome but no neonatal hepatitis syndrome and none of them underwent liver transplantation (two succumbing to end-stage liver disease before the advent of liver transplantation).393 Overall survival in this series was 62% at 20 years and seemed unaffected by availability of liver transplantation.393 The mortality is higher among patients who have more severe cardiac disease or intracranial bleeding, or who had previously undergone portoenterostomy.396, 397 A recent retrospective study suggested that affected pre-school-aged children with total serum bilirubin >111 \u00b5mol/L, serum conjugated bilirubin >77 \u00b5mol/L and serum cholesterol >13.5 mmol/L were likely to have a severe outcome, irrespective of actual JAG1 mutation.398 Liver transplantation is an option for those in end-stage liver failure, or with severe chronic cholestasis or intractable pruritus; however, severity of cardiac and renal involvement, as well as intra-abdominal vascular abnormalities, must be evaluated as contributing to increased surgical risk.399 Catch-up growth after transplantation is variable.400, 401 Long-term complications of Alagille syndrome not requiring liver transplantation have been reported including renal failure and intracranial bleeding or stroke.357, 391, 393 Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in children and adults with Alagille syndrome.402, 403, 404, 405, 406 Although rare, hepatic malignancy may occur in infants with Alagille syndrome.",

The ratio of interlobular bile ducts to the number of portal areas is between 0.0 and 0.4 compared with 0.9 and 1.8 in normal children. A reduced number of portal areas has been noted.407 The loss of bile ducts is progressive from early infancy to childhood.357, 389, 412, 413, 414 Cholangiodestructive lesions have been observed in infants between 3 and 6 months of age.389, 413 The degree of cholestasis is variable in intensity and is especially prominent in the first 12 months of life. Immunohistochemical staining for endopectidase (CD10) is typically absent from the canalicular surface in children with Alagille syndrome.415 Giant cell transformation may be seen in early infancy.389, 412, 413 There is usually patchy pseudoxanthomatous change and accumulation of stainable copper and copper-associated protein in periportal hepatocytes.389, 412, 413 Copper accumulation has been demonstrated by quantitative methods in both syndromic and non-syndromic types of paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts.408 Periportal fibrosis is mild, and it may remain unchanged long-term,354 possibly due to the absence of ductular reaction, known to play a role in periportal fibrogenesis. Nonetheless, although progression to cirrhosis is rare, occasional patients do develop extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis (Fig. 3.26\n). Portal inflammation and periportal ductular reaction, when present, are seen mainly in early infancy and can suggest the presence of distal duct obstruction.389, 413, 416\n",

            "text": "Alagille syndrome is the first childhood disorder identified with a mutation in a ligand for a Notch protein. JAG1 encodes a ligand of Notch 1, one of a family of transmembrane proteins with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motifs. Notch proteins are highly conserved and have a role in determining cell fate during differentiation, especially in tissues where epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are important.419 Jagged/Notch interactions are known to be critical for determination of cell fates in early development. Notch 4 expression during embryogenesis is seen in endothelial cells of vessels forming the dorsal aorta, intersegmental vessels, cephalic vessels and the heart. The expression of Notch 1 and its ligand includes many of the organs potentially abnormal in Alagille syndrome.420\nJAG1 plays an important role in embryogenesis of the heart, kidneys and blood vessels; in embryonic and fetal liver it is expressed in portal vascular tissue. Recent studies in mice indicate that Notch signalling regulates the remodelling of the ductal plate and bile duct morphogenesis and that Jagged 1 plays an important role in this complex process.421 Jagged 1 on ductal plate and Notch 3 on portal tract mesenchyme and hepatic arterial endothelium interact for ductal plate remodelling and development of intrahepatic bile ducts.422, 423 Mice with defects in murine Jagged 1 and Notch 2 expression have abnormalities similar to human Alagille syndrome; zebrafish with knockdowns of jagged \u00b1 notch genes have biliary, pancreatic, cardiac, renal, and craniofacial developmental abnormalities; these studies suggest that Notch may promote biliary epithelial cell evolution from a bipotential precursor cells.424 In humans, mutations in JAG1 result in truncated, and inactive proteins; since residual gene expression cannot compensate, there is haploinsufficiency.363 Dose of Notch ligands is critical and this may contribute to the clinical diversity of Alagille syndrome. No clear relationship between genotype and phenotype has been found, but the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain in the JAG1 protein may influence the severity of liver disease.425, 426, 427\n",

In the former the cysts are larger, intrahepatic ducts are dilated and the gallbladder is not atretic as compared to those with choledochal cysts and biliary atresia.466 In general, the apparent choledochal cyst associated with biliary atresia is actually proximal duct dilatation associated with focal atresia of the distal common bile duct, so-called \u2018correctable\u2019 or cystic atresia.",

The anomaly allows pancreatobiliary regurgitation since hydrostatic pressure within the pancreatic duct is usually higher than that in the common bile duct. As a result, high pancreatic enzyme levels are found in the bile. Common channels may occur without bile duct dilatation and lead to primarily gallbladder rather than biliary complications including malignancy. In this instance prophylactic cholecystectomy might be sufficient whereas biliary complications and the risk of cholangiocarcinoma underpin the need for radical surgical resection in those associated with choledochal cysts.464\n",

Histopathologically, the wall is usually thickened by inflammation and fibrosis, and is bile stained. Smooth muscle fibres may be identified in the lower portion of the cyst but not in the narrow (intrapancreatic) portion.475 There is generally no epithelial lining but islets of cylindrical or columnar epithelium may be preserved (Fig. 3.29\n). Intestinal metaplasia with mucous gland proliferation, as well as the presence of goblet and Paneth cells and neuroendocrine differentiation, have been reported.476, 477 According to Komi et al.477 the intestinal metaplasia increases with age, so that it can be demonstrated in almost all cysts from patients over 15 years of age. Kusunoki et al. noted the absence of ganglion cells in the narrow portion of a choledochal cyst, and suggested that the cyst could be the result of postganglionic neural dysfunction.478\n",

Interestingly, bile from congenital choledochal cyst patients is shown to promote the proliferation of human cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells.486 Certain bile acid fractions together with reflux of pancreatic enzymes may play a primary role as pancreaticobiliary maljunction is associated with an increased risk of biliary tree malignancy irrespective of the presence of cysts.487\n",

They represent a spectrum of microscopic and/or macroscopic cystic lesions often associated with fibrocystic anomalies in the kidneys. The severity of the renal lesions may overshadow the liver disease, as in the early presentation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Conversely, portal hypertension with a preserved liver function may later in life dominate the picture, as exemplified by congenital hepatic fibrosis. Cholangitis may develop, especially when the cysts communicate with the biliary system. These abnormalities are classified as ductal plate malformation,488, 489 a term which refers to the histological changes of circumferentially disposed and variably ectatic bile ducts and ductules, often directly abutting the hepatocytic plates, which resemble an exuberant embryonal ductal plate. The main disorders, in particular autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), the closely associated congenital hepatic fibrosis and Caroli disease, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), are discussed in detail, whereas the rarer associated syndromes, which have been comprehensively reviewed by Knisely,490 are briefly mentioned. Over the past decade genes and encoded proteins for several of these disorders have been identified and these are summarized in Table 3.2\n. The recognition that the \u2018cystoproteins\u2019, the mutation of which causes polycystic disease, have been localized in the primary cilia or basal bodies of tubular epithelial cells has led to a renewed interest in these forgotten structures. The clinicopathological discussion of specific disorders is therefore preceded by a short account on cilia and cystogenesis; more details and comprehensive references can be found in recent reviews.491, 492\n",

Primary (or solitary) cilia arise from centrioles and form a finger-like extension of the cytoplasm covered with the cell membrane. In their axis primary cilia contain a system of nine pairs of longitudinal microtubules arranged in a circle (the axoneme); in contrast, motile cilia (such as those in ciliated respiratory epithelium) contain a set of two centrally-located microtubules within the circle of the nine pairs of longitudinal microtubules (\u20189+2 pattern\u2019). The pattern typical of, and defining, primary ciliary is the \u20189+0 pattern\u2019.493 The microtubules secure the circulation of non-membrane bound macromolecules \u2013 intraflagellar transport \u2013 which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and also acts as a sensory process, in that the particles and associated peptides are changed in the cilium and carry a message back to the cell body. The solitary cilium is at present considered to represent a sensory antenna, functioning through the polycystin complex as a mechanotransducer. Loss of function of the complex results in perturbation of normal intracellular Ca2+ concentration which underlies a multitude of pathological reactions.494 Severe alterations in structure and function of tubular or ductal cells will follow involving cell\u2013cell contact, actin cytoskeleton organization, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cell proliferation and apoptosis.495\n",

Autocrine and paracrine factors, including IL-8, epithelial neutrophil attractant 78, IL-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor, secreted into the cystic lumen modulate the rate of errant hepatic cyst growth.506 In ARPKD, findings suggestive of similarity with renal cystogenesis include: the localization of PKHD1 in the cilia of cholangiocytes in the PCK rat,502 which is a model for Caroli syndrome,507 the finding that hepatocyte nuclear factor1\u03b2 (HNF1\u03b2) localized in bile duct epithelium regulates expression of PKHD1,508 together with other \u2018cystoproteins\u2019 that co-localize into the cilium.509\n",

The findings suggest that fibrocystin/polyductin, already expressed in the embryonic ductal plate stage512 acts as a matrix sensor and signal receptor during intrahepatic bile duct development, and that its mutation results in a congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF)-like picture.513 Its role in liver and kidney appears to be functionally divergent, because protein domains essential for bile duct development do not affect nephrogenesis in this model.511\n",

Fifty per cent of patients are diagnosed perinatally and die shortly after birth.517 In the series of Blyth and Ockenden521, no infant survived beyond 6 weeks of age. The majority of patients were admitted with signs of respiratory distress and had marked abdominal distension due to huge symmetrical renal masses. Liver function test abnormalities were uncommon. Surviving patients with the neonatal type of the disease develop gradually increasing renal insufficiency and systemic hypertension. Pyelonephritis is common. Portal fibrosis and cystic dilatation of bile ducts are severe, and cholangitis is a frequent complication. In the infantile group the clinical picture is either of chronic renal failure or of increasing portal hypertension. Portal fibrosis is moderate. The juvenile group of Blyth and Ockenden521 typically includes children (1\u20135 years old) who present with portal hypertension. Liver histopathological changes are marked. It is likely that this group represents cases of congenital hepatic fibrosis, as suggested by Landing et al.524 Gang and Herrin525 have found that ARPKD has a spectrum of phenotype expression with prognostic implications, but suggest that not all cases fit into the sharply defined subgroups of Blyth and Ockenden. In their study of 11 patients, four had 90% or more renal cystic change; these patients did not survive beyond 20 days of birth. In contrast, five of the seven less severely affected patients with a 20\u201375% range of cystic changes in the kidneys were all alive at 6\u201321 years of age.",

Histologically, the changes range from a persistent, circular ductal plate (Fig. 3.30\n) to a striking increase in the number of biliary channels which arise in portal areas and extend irregularly and deeply into the parenchyma (Fig. 3.31A\n). They appear to branch or \u2018anastomose\u2019 and often show polypoid projections (Fig. 3.31B). Normal interlobular ducts with corresponding arteries are not seen. According to Witzleben,522 the biliary channels are in continuity with the rest of the biliary system, similar to the cystic spaces of Caroli disease (\u2018communicating\u2019 cystic disease), in contrast to the non-communicating ADPKD. The supporting connective tissue is very scanty and, in the intralobular extensions, the basement membrane of the epithelium appears to be in direct contact with the liver cell plates. The epithelial lining consists of a single layer of low columnar to cuboidal cells. Cyst formation is uncommon. The dilated channels may contain a small quantity of a pink or orange-coloured material or, rarely, pus. Reconstruction studies by Adams et al.526 have shown irregularly dilated ducts running longitudinally at the periphery of the portal tract and anastomosing so extensively that they formed a single annular channel; no main interlobular duct could be identified in that portal tract or in several others from the same liver. A stereological study of 10 cases by J\u00f6rgensen527 showed ductal structures that could be divided into two groups: one consisted of irregular tubular structures shaped like circular cylinders, and the other of elliptical cylinders (the \u2018ductal plates\u2019). These were dilated but cysts were rare. In patients who survive for months or years there is marked fibrosis in the liver as well as kidney lesions which appear to have been progressive lesions.",

Irregularly shaped islands of hepatic tissue, some incorporating several lobules, may be seen (Fig. 3.32\n). When the bands of fibrous tissue are thick, hepatic venules may be encroached upon and become incorporated within the fibrous tissue; thus, portal hypertension in this condition may not always be presinusoidal. The fibrous bands may encircle single or groups of lobules; occasionally, a small islet of hepatic tissue becomes separated from an acinus and encircled by fibrous tissue. Numerous uniform and generally small bile ducts are scattered in the fibrous tissue (Fig. 3.33\n). An interrupted circular arrangement of the ducts (ductal plate malformation) is often recognizable (Fig. 3.34\n). The ducts are lined by cuboidal to low columnar epithelium and may contain bile or traces of mucin. They may be slightly dilated and irregular in outline. Cholestasis is not a feature of the uncomplicated case of CHF. Reduction in the number of portal vein branches is often apparent, the likely cause of the portal hypertension. There is generally little inflammation in CHF except in cases associated with cholangitis, when numerous neutrophils infiltrate ducts, ductules and surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 3.35\n); rupture of the ducts can result in micro-abscess formation. Histopathologically, the latter cases may be difficult to differentiate from extrahepatic biliary obstruction with ascending infection, particularly since there may be an associated tissue cholestasis. The correct diagnosis must be based on the history, clinical findings and the results of imaging studies. Cholestasis is particularly prominent in those cases associated with microscopic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, too subtle to be seen on imaging (\u2018microscopical Caroli\u2019). Recurrent cholangitis may lead to progressive fibrosis with functional impairment similar to cirrhosis.",

Microscopically, the dilated ducts usually show severe chronic inflammation, with or without superimposed acute inflammation, and varying degrees of fibrosis (Fig. 3.37\n). The epithelium may appear normal (cuboidal to tall columnar), partly or completely ulcerated, or focally hyperplastic; all of these changes can be found in different ducts in the same liver (Fig. 3.38\n). Mucous glands (sometimes in abundance) may be present in the fibrotic and inflamed wall. Areas of severe epithelial dysplasia are seen rarely.575 The lumen contains admixtures of inspissated mucin and bile, calcareous material, or frank pus during bouts of acute cholangitis (Fig. 3.39\n).

The PKD1 gene lies on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p 13.3), immediately adjacent to the TSC2, a gene responsible for approximately 50% of tuberous sclerosis.496, 579 The incidence of ADPKD due to mutations in PKD1 is 1 in 1000 live birth, comprising 90% of cases. The PKD1 gene encodes a protein called polycystin.580 It is present in plasma membranes of renal tubular cells, bile ductules, pancreatic ducts,581 hepatocytes and cells of large bile ducts. In the kidney, localization at the contact points (only between neighbouring cells) indicates that its main function is cell to cell interaction, such that loss of function contributes to cyst formation.582 The PKD2 gene is located on chromosome 4 (4q 21\u201323) and encodes a 100 kD protein, polycystin 2 with sequence homology to \u03b1 subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels.583 As mentioned earlier, localization of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 to primary cilia in cultured renal epithelial cells513 and demonstration that the proteins function as a ciliary flow-sensitive mechanosensors584 implicate defects in ciliary structure and function as an important mechanism of cyst formation.509 There is at least one unmapped focus, which accounts for 5% of the disease population.585 Although PKD2 is clinically milder than PKD1, it does have a deleterious impact on overall life expectancy and cannot be regarded as a benign disorder.586 The mean age to death or end-stage renal disease is 53 years in PKD1-associated disease, 69 years in PKD2-associated disease and 78 years in controls. PKD2 patients are less likely to have systemic hypertension, urinary tract infections and haematuria.586 Cerebral aneurysms are found in 10\u201315% of patients with PKD1 and represent a significant risk of subarachnoidal haemorrhage causing death and disability. Familial clustering of bleeding from intracranial aneurysms is recorded.587 In an earlier mutational analysis of 58 ADPKD families with vascular complications 51 were PKD1 (88%) and seven PKD2 (12%). The authors found that the position of the mutation in PKD1 is predictive for development of intracranial aneurysms (59 mutations are more commonly associated with vascular disease) and is therefore of prognostic importance.588\n",

In contrast, the non-dialyzed population demonstrated a 75% incidence of liver cysts in females and 44% incidence in males, the peak incidence occurring 10 years earlier in females. The cysts were larger and greater in number in the non-dialyzed females, and there was a correlation with the number of pregnancies. Nineteen autopsies were reported in which five deaths were liver-related. Risk factors for the development of hepatic cysts in ADPKD were also examined in 39 patients and 189 unaffected family members by Gabow.605 The hepatic expression of the disease was found to be modulated by age, female gender, pregnancy, and severity of the renal lesion and functional impairment.

The constituent ducts or ductules are embedded in a collagenous stroma, are round or irregular in shape, and have a slightly dilated lumen (Fig. 3.44\n). They are lined by low columnar or cuboidal epithelium and contain pink amorphous material that may be bile-stained, or actual bile (Fig. 3.45\n). Cholangiocarcinomas have been reported in association with von Meyenburg complexes,621, 622 as well as with multiple hepatic cysts considered part of the spectrum of ADPKD.623, 624 Congenital hepatic fibrosis has been found in some cases.625 Intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas has been reported.626\n",

This protein now renamed hepatocystin, seems to segregate in families with PCLD.630, 631 The protein is widely distributed in tissues and predicted to be an endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein that recycles from the Golgi. The mutations found in PCLD are all predicted to cause premature chain termination, rendering loss-of-function changes most likely. The two-hit hypothesis for cyst formation in ADPKD appears applicable to PCLD. Glucosidase II plays a major role in regulation of proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins. Polycystin-1, polycystin-2, and fibrocystin/polyductin are all glycoproteins. Mutations could compromise the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the newly synthesized glycoproteins.631 Improper association and trafficking of the polycystins due to defective glycosylation by mutant GII\u03b2 may link PCLD to the ADPKD pathway. This would be consistent with the marked similarity in clinical liver disease in both conditions.630 The second gene involved in PCLD, SEC63, encodes a protein that is part of the multicomponent translocon of the endoplasmic reticulum (Sec63p) which is required in both the post-translational and the co-translational (or signal recognition particle-dependent) targeting pathway and may explain a functional link between the two genes known to be associated with PCLD. Respective lack of expression of hepatocystin and Sep63p in PCLD cyst lining appears to correlate with mutational results.632 Immunohistochemical analysis of cyst lining suggests that the disease involves overexpression of growth factor receptors and loss of adhesion, but proliferation or deregulated apoptosis do not seem to be implicated in PLCD. Differential findings for PRKCSH- and SEC63-PCLD suggest a divergent mechanism for cystogenesis in the two groups.633\n",

When present, symptoms include fullness or an upper abdominal mass, nausea and occasional vomiting. Rapid enlargement has been reported in infancy.636 Jaundice occurs infrequently.637 An acute abdominal crisis may result from torsion, strangulation, haemorrhage into the cyst or rupture.638 Diagnosis is usually established by ultrasonography, computed tomography or other imaging modalities. Solitary bile duct cysts involve the right lobe twice as often as the left. Rarely, they can arise in the falciform ligament.639 They are usually round and rarely are pedunculated; the lining is typically smooth (Fig. 3.46\n). The larger ones may contain one to several litres of fluid which is usually clear, but may be mucoid, purulent (if the cyst is infected), haemorrhagic or rarely bile-stained.",

In addition, metabolic disorders were subsequently diagnosed in many patients who had survived an acute disease attributed to Reye syndrome.658 Consequently, the following account may be in part historical as it is largely based on data collected at a time when our knowledge of metabolic disorders and their diagnostic tools were limited. Nevertheless, it seems likely that Reye syndrome as such exists and may reflect a pharmacogenetic or immunogenetic susceptibility in those who do not have a demonstrable metabolic disorder. Which drugs or environmental toxins and which viruses may contribute to development of classic Reye syndrome remain a conundrum.",

Initial symptoms include vomiting (usually repetitive), lethargy and changes in mental status. Hepatic dysfunction can be overlooked since the liver is minimally enlarged, and there is no jaundice or splenomegaly. Subsequent symptoms and signs are predominantly neurological and terminate in coma. Seizures sometimes occur, particularly in younger children with hypoglycaemia. Most patients have received multiple medications, including aspirin, for the symptoms of the viral illness. Initial laboratory screening tests disclose elevated serum aminotransferase levels, hyperammonaemia and coagulopathy. Although the liver disease is benign and transient, the encephalopathy (secondary to a hypoxic/metabolic insult resulting in cerebral oedema) can be life-threatening and can result in permanent neurological disability.652 Early diagnosis based on clinical findings and liver biopsy, along with meticulous supportive care, results in decreased mortality and morbidity.",

The lipid droplets are consistently smaller in the perivenular zone than in other areas.661 Vacuolization may not be evident in biopsy material obtained less than 24 h after the onset of encephalopathy, even though appropriately stained frozen sections will reveal an abundance of fat. Nuclei of the liver cells are enlarged and centrally located. Mitotic activity of variable degree may be seen. Hepatocellular necrosis is generally absent or is mild and spotty. Periportal necrosis is occasionally found,662 preceded by ballooning degeneration of periportal hepatocytes. Variation in the severity of glycogen depletion of liver cells in early biopsies correlates with other histological measures of severity, and with the occurrence of hypoglycaemia, severity of encephalopathy at the time of admission, and the mortality rate. Portal inflammation is either minimal or absent. Cholestasis is rarely observed; in some instances it may be related to an associated pancreatitis.663 Reduction of succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activities (and other mitochondrial enzymes) has been demonstrated by enzymatic stains and is most helpful in confirming the diagnosis664 (Fig. 3.49B).",

Hepatobiliary complications comprise hepatosplenomegaly, mild ascites and hydrops of the gallbladder. Jaundice is a rare presentation.676 The laboratory data include abnormal electrocardiograms, neutrophil leucocytosis with a shift to the left, thrombocytosis and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Mortality in boys during the first 2 months of the illness is twice the average rate for the disease generally.677 Coronary aneurysms and myocarditis occur in 10\u201320% of patients, with a higher incidence in boys.678 Thus it is a major cause of acquired heart disease in children. Early therapy with high-dose intravenous \u03b3-globulin and perhaps aspirin has proved beneficial, the former seemingly reducing the frequency of coronary artery abnormalities.679, 680 Male sex, abnormal liver enzymes, low albumin and platelets, and the percentage leukocytes/lymphocytes have been found as risk factors for treatment non-response.681 Patients less than 1 year old or more than 9 years old at diagnosis may have poorer outcomes.682 Atypical cases not fulfilling the conventional diagnostic criteria have a much higher mortality rate, perhaps because of the lack of therapy.683\n",

Microscopically, the vessels show periarterial inflammation, necrosis and destruction of the media, and intimal inflammation. Lesions of varying stages can be observed in different vessels in the same patient and in different areas of the same type of vessel (e.g. coronary arteries), suggesting that the inflammatory process continues over a period of time during the course of the disease.

The course is protracted, lasting from 3 to 9 months, but the prognosis is usually excellent. The disease can involve extranodal sites, including soft tissues, the oral cavity, lower respiratory tract, genitourinary system, and the liver. Involvement of the last three organs is associated with a poor prognosis.735 Liver involvement is uncommon.736 Lauwers et al. studied 11 patients in whom the disease involved the intestinal tract (five cases), liver (five cases) and pancreas (one case).737 Most patients also had evidence of disease in other extranodal sites, as well as in one or more lymph node groups.",

The cells are seen in portal areas and in hepatic sinusoids. They display avid leucophagocytosis, but can also phagocytose red cells. According to Eisen et al.,738 the cells express: S-100 protein (Fig. 3.63C); pan-macrophage antigens such as EBM11, HAM56 and Leu-M3; antigens functionally associated with phagocytosis (Fc receptor for IgG and complement receptor); antigens functionally associated with lysosomal activity (lysozyme, \u03b11-antitrypsin and \u03b11-antichymotrypsin); antigens associated with early inflammation (Mac-387, 27E10); antigens commonly found on monocytes, but not tissue macrophages (OKM5, Leu-M1); and activation antigens (Ki-1 and receptors for transferrin and interleukin-2).

FLH is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder; one causative gene (PFR1, localized to chromosome 10q21\u201322) encoding for perforin, a cytotoxic effector protein, is identified in a subset of patients.739, 740 Genes implicated are all important for the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules which contain perforin and granzymes and induce apoptosis upon entering the target cell and therefore are important for the downregulation of the immune response.741 FLH can usually be distinguished from other infantile causes of histiocytosis by the absence of skin lesions and the high incidence of central nervous system involvement. The disease is characterized by fever, anorexia, irritability and pallor in infancy and early childhood. Jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly may develop later. FLH may present as liver failure in infancy; since FLH often shows very high serum ferritin levels, distinction from so-called neonatal haemochromatosis can be difficult.742, 743 Tissue specimens are critical in distinguishing these two diseases as liver transplantation is contraindicated in FHL, whereas it might be life-saving in neonatal haemochromatosis.743 Markedly abnormal coagulation studies reflect low fibrinogen levels and thrombocytopenia, but other coagulation factors are normal. Neurological symptoms may develop from histiocytic involvement of the brain. Although clinical manifestations may remit temporarily, the disease is eventually fatal. The diagnosis is based on identifying erythrophagocytosis by histiocytes in bone marrow biopsy material, or occasionally on liver biopsy. Perforin expression by peripheral lymphocytes, assessment of 2B4 lymphocyte receptor, and natural killer (NK) cell activity have been proposed as rapid tests to assist differentiating FLH from HLH subtypes, therefore highlighting patients with a poor prognosis who may benefit from bone marrow transplantation.739\n",

The syndrome may also develop in diseases other than infections, such as lymphoma and disseminated carcinoma.754, 755 Reactive (secondary) HLH and macrophage activation syndrome manifest as a massive cytokine and chemokine release, mostly TNF\u03b1, interferon (IFN)\u03b3, soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, IL-6, and other cytokines whose levels in the blood may have a prognostic value.756 This cytokine profile distinguishes HLH from the primary familial conditions in which an underlying genetic defect is identified.

Its true incidence remains to be determined. A number of cases may occur as an incidental finding of abnormal cell counts and blast cells in the peripheral blood in an otherwise well child, but in approximately 20% of cases the disease is manifest as hydrops fetalis and liver or multi-organ failure resulting in death. Of those children who enter a spontaneous remission, 13\u201333% have been found to develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, usually within the first 3 years of life, which if left untreated is fatal. In trisomy 21 fetal haemopoietic progenitors acquire N-terminal truncating mutations in the key megakaryocyte-erythroid transcription factor GATA1. Mutations are found in blast cells of both transient myeloproliferative disorder and megakaryoblastic leukaemia,770 suggesting that additional as yet unidentified (epi)genetic mutations are required for progression to AMKL.771 A recent multicentre survey suggest a good response of leukaemic cases to early therapy with standard-dose intensive chemotherapy including cytarabine and anthracyclines.772\n",
