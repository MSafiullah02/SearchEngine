There is disagreement over the appropriateness of terms such as mesenchymal stem cell, and the related terms bone marrow stromal cell, mesenchymal progenitor cell, and bone marrow progenitor cell; hMSCs are generally understood to refer to the fibroblast-like cells shown, more recently, to also be capable of differentiating into non-mesenchymal lineages such as cardiac, renal, hepatic, and neural cells [16]. They are important to the normal function of hematopoietic stem cells, and have been investigated for use in cancer therapy due to their tendency to localize to solid tumors [17]. Sources for deriving hRPCs include fetal retinas, ESCs, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); there is suggestion in the literature that the fetal-derived RPCs may be more suitable for therapy due to lower immunogenicity and increased stability [18].",

Initial attempts at transplanting neural and retinal stem cells into the degenerating retina proved unsuccessful, and it was seen that these cells neither integrated into the retina, nor restored vision [19\u201322]. However, MacLaren et al. [23] noted that the mammalian retina can incorporate rod photoreceptor precursors derived from the post-natal day 1 (P1) retina of mice into the outer nuclear layer (ONL). They observed that these cells differentiated, formed functional synapses, and improved vision in mouse models of degenerative retinal disease. The conclusion drawn was that the ontogenetic stage of the precursor cells, defined in this case by the expression of neural retina leucine zipper (Nrl), is vital to the integration of the stem cells into the retina [23].",

They organized the roles of stem cells in treatment of the eyes into three categories: vehicles for drug delivery, immunomodulatory agents, and mediators of tissue regeneration. Progress is being made in the understanding of each of these roles and the ways to effectively utilize them. In terms of tissue regeneration, researchers are often capable of inducing growth and development of transplanted cells, and in some cases, notable integration into the framework of the host cells is observed. In a study with primates treated with the hypoxia-inducing agent cobalt chloride and irradiation to mimic retinal disease, the transplantation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was noted to result in survival and maturation of the transplanted cells, as well as some integration of the cells with host bipolar cells [29]. Singhal et al. [30] demonstrated that M\u00fcller glia which exhibit multipotentiality can be induced to differentiate into retinal ganglionic cells (RGCs) upon treatment with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and \u03b3-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) to inhibit Notch signaling. This differentiation into RGCs correlated to a significant improvement in retinal function as measured by electroretinogram.",

Canola et al. [31] observed that this cell incorporation occurred to a greater extent in more advanced stages of disease.

            "text": "As mentioned previously, VEGF is a major mediator of angiogenesis in exudative AMD, and its inhibition can result in improved prognosis. VEGF antibodies and inhibitory agents have been used to good effect in the management of exudative AMD [46, 107, 108]. One of the inconveniences associated with VEGF antibody administration is that it requires regular intravitreal injections. AAV2 vectors carrying proteins that bind VEGF components have been effective in limiting new vessel formation in wet AMD. Extracellular VEGF is bound and prevented from interacting with the endothelial receptors FLT-1 and FLK by soluble FLT-1 (sFLT-1) [46]. Treatments with AAV2 vectors carrying sFLT-1 have inhibited neovascularization, and the use of rAAV.sFLT-1 and AAV2-sFLT01 have been shown to be safe in humans [109\u2013112]. In phase 1 and phase 2a clinical trials, rAAV2-mediated gene delivery of sFLT-1 resulted in improved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in 62% of patients [111, 113, 114]. AAV2-sFLT01 is a novel chimeric protein that can be used to inhibit choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Pechan et al. [77] described the generation of two novel chimeric VEGF-binding proteins: sFLT01 and sFLT02. These proteins are comprised of an IgG-like chain of Flt-1 fused to either a human IgG1 Fc region or to its methyl domain. Several studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy of the AAV2 vector-mediated treatment of neovascularization in wet AMD models and patients [111, 112, 115\u2013118]. Viral vectors carrying endostatin and angiostatin, the collagen and fibrinogen cleavage products, have efficacy in the inhibition of angiogenesis in exudative AMD [85, 119\u2013121]. The safety of lentiviral Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) as a method for ocular gene therapy in humans has been demonstrated in clinical trials [122]. Campochiaro et al. [122] noted that long-term expression of angiostatin and endostatin was observed through the latest measurement of eight neovascular AMD subjects after more than 2.5 years, and two subjects after more than 4 years. It was recently demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1) inhibits retinal angiogenesis in mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy by blocking the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and inhibiting VEGF expression [123].",

As the disease progresses, central vision also becomes compromised resulting in legal blindness. The prevalence of RP globally is estimated at approximately 1 in 4000 [126, 127]. Depending on its form, RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked recessive manner [126, 128\u2013130]. Spontaneous mutations undoubtedly account for some cases of RP, as approximately 40% of RP cases are isolated instances that present without any other family members being affected [131].

Promising treatments do exist in this area: BDNF has been shown to improve survival of neurons and RGCs and to preserve the structure of the optic nerve [139\u2013143]. CNTF-secreting NSCs have been noted to provide protection to photoreceptors cells in models of retinitis pigmentosa [144].

            "text": "The mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) has received attention due to the involvement of its mutation in a very rare form of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa [46, 147\u2013149]. Retinal degeneration results from a subretinal accumulation of debris from the outer segment of photoreceptors due to inhibited phagocytic activity, and this leads to apoptotic photoreceptor loss and progressively worsening performance on eletroretinography [150\u2013153]. Gene replacement studies targeting the MERTK gene have involved the vectors adeno-associated virus (AAV), adenovirus, and lentivirus [154\u2013156]. Tschernutter et al. [156] used a lentivirus-mediated process, and observed improvement of phagocytic function, decreased loss of photoreceptors, and preserved retinal function for the 7 month examination period included in the published report. It has been shown that AAV-mediated CTNF expression suppresses electrophysiological retinal responses; however, AAV-mediated GDNF expression was not associated with the same adverse effects, but improved cell survival in combination therapy with lentivirus-mediated gene replacement [157]. The tyrosine-mutant AAV8 Y733F vector expressing a human MERTK cDNA driven by an RPE-selective promoter administered subretinally has been observed to improve retinal function in RP models for an 8 month study period, with improvement in phagocytic function, decreased retinal vascular degeneration, and inhibition of M\u00fcller cell activation being noted [158]. Interestingly, AAV8 vectors appear to exhibit a greater spread in a dog model than other AAV vectors such as AAV2; in a study conducted in a primate model, both vector types transduced RPE efficiently, but the AAV8 vectors were significantly better at targeting photoreceptors than the AAV2 vectors [159, 160]. Petit et al. [161] observed that the developmental stage of rods has an effect on the gene transfer efficiency of AAV vectors, suggesting that the ability of AAV vectors to infect dying rod cells could be limited, and the gene transfer efficiency markedly reduced. Following subretinal injection, subjects with altered development of rod outer segments exhibited significantly reduced AAV transduction of rods, and increased preference for cones. A preference for rods was observed when cells had matured. This type of increase in cone transduction was also observed in adult mice with retinal degeneration as compared to wild-type mice. An understanding of vector preferences to photoreceptors will aid researchers in developing effective delivery systems and treatments.",

There has been difficulty in producing AAV vectors with RPGR due to the relative instability of its sequence [166\u2013170]. Fischer et al. [166] optimized the coding sequence of RPGRORF15 in an effort to increase sequence stability, increase expression levels of the RPGR transgene, and to remove cryptic splice sites. They demonstrated production of an AAV8 vector that consistently produced the full-length, correct RPGR protein, which rescued the disease phenotype in animal models. The glutamylation pattern of the vector-derived RPGR and that of the wild-type protein were indistinguishable which indicates a lack of significant alteration to post-translational modification. Appropriate safety was demonstrated in mice [166].",

            "text": "There have also been efforts to treat autosomal dominant RP (ADRP) using gene therapy. ADRP can be caused by mutations in more than 20 genes. Boye et al. [46] note that mutations may take the form of haploinsufficiency, dominant negative gene product, or toxic gain-of-function. In haploinsufficiency, the product produced by a single wild-type allele is not sufficient to maintain normal function. In dominant negative gene product mutation, there is usually interference with the movement or assembly of the product. Toxic gain-of-function mutations result in products that exhibit direct toxicity to the cell. More than 100 dominant mutations in the RHO gene alone have been identified [46]. Gene therapy differs depending on the type of mutation. In haploinsufficiency, therapy has involved delivery of wild-type cDNA to increase the level of normal protein to adequate levels such as in the treatment of retinal degeneration due to mutation in PRPH2 by Cai et al. [171]. Due to the complexity and diversity of dominant mutations, even those of the RHO gene alone, there have been efforts to treat the condition by using molecules such as ribozymes, synthetic miRNAs, or siRNAs to target and degrade both mutant and wild-type mRNA; due to the degenerative effect this has on the retina, these therapeutic agents must be accompanied by delivery and expression of cDNA resistant to degradation because of silent mutations [46, 172\u2013179]. Some other approaches that exhibit promise in the treatment of ADRP include AAV vector delivery of wild-type cDNA to slow retinal degeneration, and the gene transfer of molecular chaperones to assist in proper protein folding or suppress the unfolding response [46, 180, 181].",

The therapy employs an AAV2 vector carrying complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding human RPE65. Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl is injected subretinally. The FDA indications for the drug require that the patient have a confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation and viable retinal cells [188]. This drug is notable for being the first in vivo gene therapy approved by the FDA. In phase III clinical trial, it was demonstrated that patients receiving the drug experienced statistically significant improvements in multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT), and full-field stimulus testing (FST) as compared to control, indicating restoration of RPE65 enzymatic activity resulting in improved navigation in low-to-moderate light and increased light perception. There were also slight improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) noted. Ocular adverse events observed in the study participants were generally mild, with the most common being elevated intraocular pressure, cataract, retinal tear, and ocular inflammation [5]. Voretigene neparvovec appears to be a relatively safe therapy that could dramatically improve the vision of those with biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.",

            "text": "Considering research into stem cells and their use in treating ocular conditions in recent years, it appears that their greatest utility is likely in environment modification through such practices as drug delivery and immunomodulation. The role of curing retinal diseases will be more directly addressed in the immediate future through gene modulatory therapies. Gene transduction through viral vector delivery is an area of aggressive research. While some of these novel treatments are already being used in clinical medicine, their continued potential for attenuating degenerative processes and improving vision is significant and deserves continued investigation. While there have been many mutations reported, there undoubtedly remain others yet undiscovered, and identification of genes and mutations amenable to targeted therapy should continue. AAV and lentiviral vectors are the staple of therapeutic gene delivery in retinal research, and while these techniques have yielded good results, it could be of benefit to further investigate the feasibility of retroviral transduction in conjunction with retinal stem cell proliferation induction or non-viral transfection techniques in retinal gene therapy. Non-viral gene therapy is another promising area of retinal research [189, 190]. Recent investigations have made encouraging progress and showcased remarkable potential therapies to improve the visual acuity and quality of life of millions of individuals around the world. The future of treatment in retinal disease likely lies in the utilization of some form of genetic modification to combat these blinding conditions.",
