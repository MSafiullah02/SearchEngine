Of note, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-NL, and HCoV-NH represent closely related group I coronaviruses and thus may represent different strains of the same species of viruses, although this topic is currently under conflicting discussion. 9 Most HCoVs are respiratory pathogens with worldwide distribution and show a seasonal peak in incidence. Thus, there are periods of high prevalence in a defined community. It is, therefore, always difficult to link these infections to rare clinical syndromes in particular to those of hitherto unknown etiology. For example, Esper et al. 6 recently reported a temporal association between infection with HCoV-NH and Kawasaki disease by means of a case-control study in hospitalized children, with quite strong statistical significance. 2 In the meantime, this observation has been rejected by other investigators. [10] [11] [12] [13] We report the first case of an acute life threatening event (ALTE) in an infant with human coronavirus HCoV-229E infection.",

[32] [33] [34] Although our case report does not prove the association between ALTE and HCoV-229E infection, it should be noticed as a remark for further investigation. Viral infection appears to be an uncommon cause of ALTE and of sudden children death syndrome (SIDS), 35 but more detailed microbiological investigations of affected children even without apparent signs of a respiratory tract infection may help to clarify the etiology in some cases and our understanding of the pathogenesis. 36 ",
