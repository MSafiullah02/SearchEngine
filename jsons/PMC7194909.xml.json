The argument is that economic narratives, stories that offer interpretations of economic events, or morals, of hints of theories about the economy, go viral just as diseases do, because of changes in the environment and of simple mutations of the narratives that put the contagion rate above the recovery rate, as in the Kermack and McKendrick (1927) SIR model of disease epidemics.2\nThe economy is continually beset by multiple narratives, some going viral, some peaking, some fading away, and some positive in their effects on the economy, some negative, whose summed effects alter economic behavior to produce economic fluctuations. Like diseases, many of these economic narratives are perennial, and fade into a low background level until some mutation or change in conditions causes them to mysteriously explode into a renewed epidemic.",

But economists usually pay no formal attention to the history of such stories through time. Attention to these popular narratives has been stronger in other social sciences, psychology, anthropology, sociology, political science, and history. Presumably, most economists think that these narratives are of little relevance to economics. The big stickler is direction of causality, which is hard to prove. Clearly, the narratives respond to the economic situation. The big question is the other direction. Do narratives themselves also drive economic conditions? I have argued that causality is bi-directional. Creative people experiment all the time with variations on narratives, and from time to time these will become epidemics and change the nature of the economy. Other social sciences have done controlled experiments to demonstrate the causal influence of narratives, so it is to be expected that economic narratives as well have a causal impact. Seemingly trivial mutations of narratives, as when a celebrity name becomes attached to it, or when an event gives the narrative a connection with current reality, the contagion rate can rise above the forgetting rate and a weak narrative may explode into mass public attention, altering economic behavior.",

Most people, if asked, \u201cdid you spend something like 3% more or less around lifetime trend last year?\u201d would likely have no idea how to answer. They might be able to think of some major expenditures that they made, or decided not to make last year, like buying a new car, or taking a long anticipated major vacation trip. Beyond that, plus or minus a few percent is just too small to even remember. Any of the blips down were within a few years offset by increases that set per capita values to new record levels. It is important to remember this when judging the likely impact of the narratives discussed below. The impact of these narratives on spending does not need to be very large to explain a good deal of the economic fluctuations we observe.",

The peak percent of articles with \u201cGreat Depression\u201d in them may seem small, only 0.35%, or about one article in three hundred, but one must reflect on the huge number of articles or news clips people are exposed to, and actually remember. These depression narratives were often stories about the hardships people faced then, along with comparisons that suggest it may be happening again now. People have never forgotten the legend of the Great Depression, and that it led to immense social antagonisms that led to World War II. Note by comparison that there was no unusual activity in the Great Depression narrative during the second-longest economic expansion 1991\u20132001, or in the contraction 2001\u20132003. The perennial Great Depression narrative mutated when there was a run on the Northern Rock Bank in the U.K. in 2007 and in the U.S. on Washington Mutual (WAMU) in 2008, when the narrative took on a superficial resemblance to current events. During the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis politicians around the world warned of the risk of an imminent depression in a bid to win acceptance of aggressive stimulus policies, which also generated higher contagion of the Great Depression narrative. The fears engendered by this new Great Depression narrative epidemic were precisely the kind of fear that Franklin Delano Roosevelt referred to in his 1933 statement \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d This latest episode of intense attention to the Great Depression follows a nice hump-shaped epidemic curve, as for example in the Kermack McKendrick SIR model with a high contagion parameter at first and low recovery (forgetting) parameter. The slow-at-first upward path of consumption expenditures corresponds roughly to the downward path in the narrative as people gradually forget it.",

The term goes back to the Great Depression itself, when it was coined by Alvin Hansen in his 1938 presidential address before the American Economic Association, but was largely forgotten until Summers resurrected it. Lending his prestige to the narrative created more contagion to the narrative, for a while. The curve is hump-shaped, like an epidemic curve again. It comes a little later than the Great Depression narrative because it took a while for Summers to bless it. It is smaller than the Great Depression curve, possibly because a great many people do not know the intended meaning (long-term) of \u201csecular.\u201d But the message of the narratives attached to this phrase are surely inhibitory of spending, since they suggest that bad times will be here indefinitely.

Sometimes the \u201cSave More\u201d phrase attaches to narratives that are only tangentially related to such long-term plans, like how to save more on your heating bills, or on grocery shopping, but more often it appears to be about accumulating saving. The \u201cSave More\u201d message more than doubled in strength with the financial crisis year 2008, undoubtedly helped along by the crisis. In the few years after the financial crisis there were many articles about the debt trap, and about the student loan trap, about the dangers of indebtedness, that were related, if themselves less viral. But gradually, in accordance with epidemic theory, they were eventually less well-remembered, and went back to their former levels. President Donald Trump, elected in 2016 and one of the most viral celebrities of all time, launched a counter-narrative of \u201csave more,\u201d with his call to lavish living: \u201cIf you are going to think, think big.

            "text": "We need more research that would help establish narratives more securely. As I have discussed in my recent book, we need to develop better data sources about narratives, such as provided by focus interviews and focus groups, not relying so much on news media reporting, and more representative of the population at large. We need to use quantifications of narratives to establish direction of causality between narratives and economic events better. There are already econometric techniques that help us understand direction of causality that can be applied once quantification of data on narratives is more developed. Narrative epidemic models may eventually be combined with extant econometric models of the economy.",
