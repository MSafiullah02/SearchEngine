Because this was a picture very different from the well-known presentation of acute pneumococcal pneumonia, Reimann coined the term \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 to describe these cases. His observation was confirmed by subsequent similar reports and it was noted that the etiologic agents for these illnesses were unidentifiable on Gram stain and not recovered by culture methods used at the time.",

Peripheral blood leukocyte count is normal in 75\u201390% of cases. Culturing M. pneumoniae is difficult as it requires 2\u20133 weeks, and is rarely performed. Confirmation of the diagnosis of the infection usually relies upon detecting complement-fixing (CF) antibodies.

Antibody titers rise 7\u201310 days after infection, and peak at 3\u20134 weeks. Newer immunoassays may be more sensitive and specific than CF serologies. The IgM capture test is optimal to diagnose M. pneumoniae in children. An enzyme-linked immunoassay that detects IgG is preferred for adults as they may not elaborate an IgM response. As results are not available for 3\u20134 weeks, serologies are performed infrequently in clinical practice. However, they are invaluable for epidemiological investigations and tracking epidemics. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays can detect genomic DNA in nasopharyngeal secretions and are highly specific and sensitive for M. pneumoniae in patients with respiratory tract infections. However, PCR is infrequently used, except for research epidemiologic studies.",

A fourfold rise in CF antibodies against Chlamydia or a single titer of \u2a7e1:64 is considered evidence of acute infection. Microimmunofluorescence (MIF) is more specific, but is technically difficult and is performed only in research laboratories. Criteria for the diagnosis of acute C. pneumoniae by MIF include a single IgM titer of \u2a7e1:16, a fourfold rise in IgG titer (acute to convalescent), or a single IgG titer of \u2a7e1:512. In primary infections, IgM is evident at 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, followed by the IgG response at 6\u20138 weeks. The immunologic response to infection with C. pneumoniae appears incompletely protective as re-infection can occur. Re-infections are associated with IgG responses (not IgM) after 1\u20132 weeks.
