The aim of this study was to describe the perceptions of nurses with SARS in Hong Kong, as the perceptions of nurses who have suffered from SARS have not been studied. Ten nurses who had suffered from SARS were interviewed, either face-to-face or by telephone, about their subjective experiences. These interviews provided in-depth, descriptive data, which were analysed using content analysis. Nine broad categories were identified: uncertainty, information control, feelings of anger and guilt, lack of preparation and fear of death, feelings of isolation and loneliness, physical effects, support, change of perspective of life, and change of perspective of nursing. Although the dreaded disease affected the nurses tremendously, both physically and psychologically, it has also had its positive side. As a result of experiencing the illness, the participants came to treasure relationships, health and everyday life more. In caring for patients, they came to see the world more from the perspective of the patients. They found that they need to take the time to reassure patients and families and to seriously listen to all of their concerns.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread around the world within a few months. 1 The response of the community to this new health threat was breathtaking.

At present, the most efficacious treatment regimen for SARS, if any, is unknown. For patients with progressive deterioration, intensive and supportive care is of primary importance. In Hong Kong, antibiotics were given to patients suspected of having SARS; once the patients progressed to the severe stage and experienced shortness of breath, vibavirin and steroids were used. 2 Some patients had progressed to a severe stage of the disease, characterized by oxygen desaturation. They required intensive care and ventilatory support for a mean period of 6.4 days. 3, 4 Until now, the studies that have been published on patients with SARS have focused on how to control infections 5, 6 and on the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. 3, 7 This study is the first to explore how nurses who had contracted SARS perceived the experience of illness and to uncover the principal concerns of the informants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 82, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 726, "end": 727, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 913, "end": 915, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 916, "end": 917, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1032, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1034, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1088, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1090, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "A qualitative approach was adopted in this study on the premise that such knowledge cannot be obtained without reference to experience and without being defined by the individuals themselves. 8 Face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted with the nurses suffering from SARS, using a semistructured interview guide.

The within-case analysis was performed by identifying the important variables and associations in relation to the case. Different tactics of analysis, including clustering, noting themes and patterns, and making comparisons of variables, were employed. The next step was the crosscase analysis, where the data on the cases were compared and contrasted with noted generalizations and particularities.

Other factors that contributed to the uncertainty were the dramatic change in role (from nurse to patient) experienced by the informants, the sense of powerlessness associated with enforced passivity and the neglect of a person's holistic needs in an environment that focused on physiological priorities. As Lazarus and Folkman stated, uncertainty results from the cognitive appraisal of an event for which the outcome is unclear or the cues are inadequate, unfamiliar, contradictory or numerous. 11 During the diagnostic period, the informants were unsure about whether they were confirmed to have contracted SARS. In the initial stage, chest X-rays did not show any opacity or haziness until computerized tomography was employed.

One important aspect that contributed to the feeling that they lacked control was when the participants could not obtain information from health professionals. This was especially true of nurses who were caring for infected patients in isolation because they were fearful of contracting the disease themselves and of being seen as negligent. The potential for the nurse to help patients effectively cope with and manage the disease was limited; consequently, the patients continued to feel anxious and depressed: Good information support will lead to an individual approach to care and to the ability to foster a sense of control in patients. Providing them with knowledge allows them to become involved in making decisions and makes them aware of the alternatives and the anticipated consequences of each alternative course of action. Knowledge is one factor that decreases uncertainty. 12, 13 Seligman stated that when individuals are continually exposed to uncontrollable events, they will feel helpless. 14 This includes a lower sense of control over outcomes, depression and a decreased motivation to initiate new problem-solving approaches.

Usually, when patients were suspected of having SARS, they were immediately admitted to the hospitals and given no time to finish what they were doing. A male nurse gave the following account: The informants had to deal with thoughts of death because of the suddenness and severity of the disease.

I really wanted to know the results after the blood sample had been taken. I would appreciate it if the nurse would let me know the results. But the nurses would not tell me. I assume they are afraid of coming in, afraid of the possibility of contracting SARS. When I asked the physicians about my condition, their answers were nothing special, and were more or less the same. Actually, they would never answer my question. I wanted them to explain things to me in more detail and discuss with me what they knew, such as what condition I was in and whether I was going to live or die. I wanted to know my condition. For example, I wanted to know the results of my blood test: what was my lymphocyte count and had my white blood cell count gone up? Had my condition improved, deteriorated or remained the same? As I was already isolated, this lack of knowledge about my condition made me feel very helpless.By contrast, another informant mentioned that his medical doctor provided a detailed explanation of his condition, which increased the informant's confidence in the treatment he had been given:The doctor came in twice a day and closely monitored my situation. He would talk to me to understand more about my condition, to prescribe the appropriate medication. When he decided to put me on steroids, he not only explained why he thought this was necessary for me but also rang my wife to explain the situation, as I could not ring my wife because of my irritating cough. My trust in the medical physician increased my confidence in the treatment.The need for information was not only related to the disease, but also to everyday activities in the isolation ward, as depicted by one informant:I was upset because I was not told about information related to the ward. For example, I did not realize until near discharge that I could have the choice of choosing my menu for breakfast and lunch. I had been asking my colleagues to buy breakfast for me for more than two weeks.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "a result of my illness, my family, friends and those who have come into contact with me have to go through 10 days of quarantine.

During my waking hours, my thoughts were muddled. Nevertheless, I wrote down my plans and my will. I needed to set my affairs in order before I died. During the acute stage, I had a very difficult time for 5-6 days. Each breath was difficult for me. The physician increased my dosages of ribivarin and steroid. Using computerized tomography, opacification and consolidation of the lungs was found. I was really frightened, and my respiration went up to 50/min. I thought about death. I was afraid that I would not see my family for the last time. I was not psychologically prepared, as I haven't written my will and hadn't arranged my affairs. There were a lot of things I hadn't told my family yet. The issue was not only of whether one would be intubated, but the issue of death.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "was hospitalized for 22 days. Each day seemed like a year to me. I found it so difficult to pass a day. Every day I waited for the doctor's round and looked forward to hearing about my condition, whether it was getting better or worse. The informants were frustrated by their withdrawal and isolation from others. It was not only during hospitalization that the informants felt lonely; one informant mentioned that she felt the same when she returned home: When I was discharged, I looked forward to seeing my family. However, there were a lot of changes in the family. My motherin-law would not come to see me because she was afraid of contracting the disease. My domestic helper had resigned. My children had moved out for two weeks so I could have some rest at home and my spouse looked after me instead. I felt so lonely. I just turned on the television to have some noise in the unit. I felt depressed. I found that it was difficult to go back to normal life after being discharged. I cried for no reason. isolated, the informants would have liked to have information about the outside world to keep them updated with what was happening in the world: We need to be in touch with the outside world. For example, in my ward, one newspaper had to be shared among five beds. If we had had a choice, I wouldn't have minded paying for the newspaper. This would at least have given us some sense of choice. However, when I was admitted, it seemed as if I had no choice in my daily life. I would like to emphasize that we were isolated for 30 days, not three days. The minimum length of stay was 21 days. Some of us had television, some hadn't. I started having the television from the ninth day of my admission. It was very difficult, very difficult to pass the time. When I returned to work, I would certainly buy newspapers for the patients if they requested it.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "During the acute stage of the illness, I didn't have the energy to even go to the toilet. After going to the toilet, I needed to rest for 15 min. When I had my daily chest X-ray taken to monitor my progress, I simply could not hold my breath. When the doctors were going about their rounds, I could not say more than one sentence. I could only nod or shake my head. I was in great distress. My hands were all stiff and cold because of the intravenous infusion of medication. Maybe my condition was worse because of the high dose of medication. I was tired.All efforts to overcome interpersonal isolation, from a word of encouragement to calls and cards from families, colleagues and friends, are important in times of intense strain and stress. Such shows of support helped sustain the morale and motivation of the informants in fighting with SARS:My family rang me and my colleagues sent me cards. They wrote a lot of kind words and words of encouragement on the cards, which brightened me up. I felt that others cared about me, which was very important.My family sent cards to me. Also, when I received cards or messages from my old colleagues, it really warmed my heart. Sometimes I rang up my colleagues and had a good chat. I felt better afterwards. I felt that others were supporting me. I really felt that psychological support was very important. Its effect might be more significant than the medications, as we were not certain about the extent to which the medication worked and the severity of its effects.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "have redefined my priority in life.
