In addition, existing channels can be modifi ed so that they can carry greater volumes of water without overfl owing their banks and move more quickly through fl ood zones (deepen, widen, straighten channels), and by adding a fl ood wall to retain waters that exceed volumes carried in the modifi ed channels.

Mass movements are a world wide problem that cause 4500 deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars damage each year to homes, infrastructure, and utilities. Other movements in this grouping include: (1) subsidence or a lowering of an area of the Earth's surface; (2) collapse of soil/rock into a void in the subsurface; (3) rockfalls; and (4) mudfl ows (debris fl ows). The latter is activated when torrential or sustained rain over a period of time loads water weight into slopes and seeps into earth materials there, lubricating them and also pushing grains apart because of increased water pressure. The heavy, lubricated, destabilized matter fi nally breaks loose and speeds downslope without warning at as much as a mile a minute (96 km/ ph). The destabilization can be further abetted when some of the earth materials comprising a slope is composed of the clay mineral class called smectite (montmorillonite/bentonite), a mineral that expands when it is wetted and shrinks when it dries. A combination of the expansion and lubrication from added water and its weight can bring down a hillside. Populations at the base of slopes and beyond are at risk of sudden burial with major loss of life. It should be noted that away from hillsides, soils that expand when wet and shrink when dry cause cracks in basements and foundations of buildings that rest on them, a property damage problem but a problem that is not a threat to the well being of people. Avoidance of possible building sites underlain by expansive/shrinkage soils or extraction of the soils prior to construction can mitigate the potential basement/foundation problem. Keeping the soils wet with an irrigation system that activates during dry weather has been used to stabilize the reactive soils.",

            "text": "Landslides occur in hilly topography (elevated terrain, >15\u00b0 slopes) where the soils are well developed, where poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks comprise the hills, where the structure of the rocks dip (angle) downward and outward from the at risk slopes, and where there is considerable rainfall. These are predictive observations that suggest the possibility of a landslide prone region. Landslides are a threat when water seeps into the hills adding water weight that increases the pull of gravity on the earth materials, increases groundwater (pore) pressure that pushes grains apart, and acts as a lubricant for subsurface earth materials. Other observations that alert citizens that there is a downslope movement of soil are cracks in the ground and trees that tilt back into a slope. A geologist's observations of scarps in a hilly area attests to it being landslide prone. Scarps are mini-cliffs often with exposed soil caused by a landslide but that may be hidden from the untrained eye by overgrowth. Tilt-meters (inclinometers) are electrical driven pieces of equipment that can be installed in slopes to telemeter movement or deformation data that suggests the possible onset of a landslide. A recent approach to identify the strong probability of a landslide and thus could serve as an early warning system that allows people to evacuate to safety uses fi ber-optic strain sensors complemented by rainfall data [ 3 ] . These sensors render continuous monitoring in time and space. Fiber-optic sensors that can detect displacement, groundwater pore pressure, displacement (slow slope slippage), ground vibrations, and temperature, are glued equally spaced to the surface of a PVC (fl exible) pipe and embedded in shallow trenches in a soil. The pipe 9.2 Mass Movements can bend or twist with pre-slope failure tensile strain (e.g., elastic, plastic, shear, viscous volumetric) registered as 3D deformation. The various sensors will register the location of the deformation on monitors at an off slope location. Physically, a landslide appears as a block of earth materials that breaks from a slope along a scarp and slides down along a concave surface pushing lobes of slide materials out at the base of the block. The areas affected by landslides are generally limited and distances landslide move are generally small although in areas of very steep topography the momentum of a landslide can carry the detached mass a signifi cant distance and across adjacent terrain. As noted previously, landslide moving into a river valley can act as a dam, cause fl ooding initially upstream and subsequently downstream when the temporary dam is breached.",

This can happen when toes of slopes that give stability to hills in landslide prone regions are cut away to establish a road. This disturbs a slope's equilibrium and is an example of bad land use planning that creates conditions that can lead to landslides. Similarly, landslides may be caused if the head of a slope at equilibrium between gravity stress trying to pull soils and rocks down and the strength of the mass resisting slope is weakened by overloading the head with housing and welltravelled roads. The added weight (stress) and vibrations from vehicular traffi c can result in a slope failure. Also, sliding can be abetted by loss of anchoring vegetation especially where logging has been active.",

One is zoning that prevents habitation where conditions are conducive for landslips if a slope were to be loaded with destabilizing weight such as the earlier cited homes and well traffi cked roads. Second, for existing habitation or planned habitation, geological engineering can diminish the threat of landslides. This is done by (1) redirecting rainwater or snowmelt so that it does note invade slopes at risk; (2) by installing retaining walls with perforations that allow in seeping water to exit a slope; and (3) by installing concrete caissons, a few feet in diameter down to base rock along the front of a vulnerable slope. These efforts are costly so that economic constraints prevent their general use. In areas of Japan where topography is hilly and where landslides threaten infrastructure including critical transportation systems, the Japanese government has invested in landslide prevention . They sealed hills with shotcrete so that rainwater or snowmelt can not seep into the hills and destabilize them with added weight and lubrication at earth material slide planes.

            "text": "An avalanche is a large mass of snow that suddenly slides downslope. There are two general types of avalanches: (1) sloughs that are small fl ows of powdery snow that are unlikely to kill people or destroy structures; (2) full depth avalanches that are massive slabs of snow that break loose from a mountain and cause death and destruction. The latter may carry ice, soil, and rock debris. Avalanches generally occur without warning on slopes >30\u00b0 and <45\u00b0at alpine areas worldwide (e.g., Swiss mountains, Western Canada, New Zealand, Alaska, the Himalayas). One or a combination of factors can contribute to an avalanche event. These include storminess, slope shape, orientation of steep slopes with respect to the sun, the rough or smooth character of the ground beneath a snowpack, vegetation, the nature of the layers of a snowpack, and vibration. Thus, if there is a 30 cm (12 in.) or more snowfall in a 24 h periods, there is likely to be an overloading and an avalanche depending on how the layers in a snowpack are bound together. Most avalanches occur during snow storms and blizzards. Clearly, a steeper convex slope is more conducive to avalanche activity. A rapid temperature increase can cause melting of a layer in the snowpack that results in an avalanche. The more vegetation there is deters the down fl ow of an avalanche as would a rough rocky surface beneath a snowpack. Vibrations from activity on a slope (skiers, snowboarders, snowmobiles), thunder storms, low fl ying jet planes, and explosions can set off an avalanche. During WWI, thousands of soldiers in Alps regions were killed by avalanches triggered by artillery fi re. Avalanches can fl ow downslope at speeds of 130 km/h (80 mph) or more. Depending on the mass being moved, an avalanche can kill people, and damage or destroy structures and infrastructure (homes, recreational areas, bridges, tunnels [block road and/or railway movement]), pipes and utility lines (water, natural gas, electricity), and put workmen maintaining an infrastructure at risk. Hundreds of people are killed by avalanches each year. During 2014 and 2015, avalanches in Nepal , triggered by an earthquake and by unseasonal severe rain and snow blizzards, roared downslope from Mount Everest and other peaks in the region. Many trekkers were killed, as were Sherpa guides and climbers preparing for the climb to the summit of Mount Everest.",

First is the cost to repair the damage done to infrastructure and structures in the areas affected by subsidence. Second are the economic losses that can be incurred if a productive sector is slowed down by not being able to extract critical fl uids from the subsurface without having to invest more funding to improve extraction by drilling wells deeper. This would likely mean an increase in the price of a commodity used to make or grow a product and hence be infl ationary for the public. A case in point is the more than four year severe drought being suffered in 2015 in the Central Valley (especially the San Joaquin Valley) of California, USA where subsidence has been a recurring problem during past droughts as groundwater was extracted, but not excessively, from aquifers to make up for the shortage of surface water. However, excessive groundwater pumping during the existing extended drought, mainly by the agricultural sector, has lowered groundwater tables to 100 ft (~30 m) lower than recorded in the past. As a result some areas experienced a subsidence of up to two inches (5 cm) a month as fi negrained layers in the aquifer were depleted of their buoyancy pressure and compacted. If the compaction is tight enough, part of the storage capacity (porosity) and permeability (ability to transmit fl uids) of an aquifer could be lost. The subsidence varies with location in the valley. One area subsided at 1/2 in. a month. The maximum subsidence was about a foot (12 in. or 30 cm) a month [ 5 ] . Another result of the over pumping is a reduction of fresh water pressure in the aquifer that could result in salt water intrusion where the aquifer extends to the marine continental shelf.",

The aqueduct carries water from northern California rivers that receive melt from the Sierra Nevada snowpack and from rainwater some 400 miles (~600 km) to southern California. Change in the fall (inclination) of sections of the aqueduct from subsidence and low spots on the system prevent the water from fl owing as well as it did pre-subsidence and thus needs reworking. Changes in the fall of sewer lines have to be repaired to prevent sewage backup and its consequences from a reversal of slope. Similarly, water pipelines have to be reset to allow effi cient fl ow of water. Some bridges have subsided to the degree that they are no longer above the water surface. Roads are ruptured and have to be repaired. Levees in place for fl ood control when the rains come have sunk and have to be raised. Building foundations sink as well and need correction. Very important in this agriculturally dependent valley and its towns has been the destruction of thousands of public and private well casings. California and the agriculture industry have the economic wherewithal to make the necessary repairs once the drought breaks. The Central Valley grows about 50 % of the vegetables and fruits sold in the United States. As previously indicated, if crops fail or yields drop because of the lack of water for irrigation, the cost of the produce and fruit will increase. The state is investing large sums of money to develop a capital improvement program.",

This is an action that takes place most often where there is a relatively high water table in terrain underlain by limestone, a rock type that houses many famous cave systems worldwide. In this scenario, groundwater moving slowly through limestone continually during geologic time (millions of years) dissolves the limestone leaving voids in the subsurface. When these are large enough and the roof rock strength cannot resist the pull of gravity, the roof rock collapses into the subsurface cavity. The areas affected are generally small, rounded or oval shaped, and tens of meters or less across. Sinkholes have caused structural damage to buildings, swallowed homes and car dealerships, ruptured roads (pavements) including highways, and in rare cases have caused injury and death. Sinkholes have developed as well in terrain underlain by salt-rich (evaporite) strata that are dissolved by irregular groundwater fl ow. In some cases, water pipes underlying roadways have broken and the released water has washed out the earth materials around a ruptured waterlines creating open spaces in the subsurface into which earth/road materials have collapsed. Underground coal fi res can create cavities into which the overlying rock and soil can subside and ultimately collapse.",

For example, a geologist will fi rst assess the geology of the area under study (especially when underlain by limestone or dolostone), the topography, and determine the position of the water table that could cause dissolution of underlying rock. He/ she will review the history of insurance claims against collapse situations in the area. In a surface analysis, the geologist will look for signs of potential surface movement that could portent sinkhole activity by examining building foundations in the neighborhood for visible cracks, especially arcuate ones, cracks in roads or sidewalk pavement, and depressions or low spots in the terrain as well as the presence of small ponds that could represent former sinkholes. This study will suggest the level of risk in an area but only an investigation of the subsurface conditions can give more accurate vulnerability information. This can be done using ground penetrating radar (GPR) that takes a short time using modern equipment that digitizes data for ready presentation and interpretation [ 6 ] . In one Florida study, the GPR data for nine 60 m lines were generated in 2 h. Another option is to do a seismic study that will yield information as to the solid rock nature or void presence in the subsurface. Studies such as these, where collapse is an endemic problem, but on a larger, perhaps county scale, can result in sinkhole vulnerability maps that can guide land use planning for small scale evaluations of potential sites for buildings or infrastructure. Where there is a void in the subsurface but there is a need to use the terrain, it may be possible to fi ll the void with grout to stabilize the surface but this can be very costly.",

Response team training in all countries is essential to initially deal with a disease. Obviously, there has to be open and clear lines of instant communication between health organizations locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally when disease surveillance detects an outbreak node of a known or unidentifi ed infectious disease.
