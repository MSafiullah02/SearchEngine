Rapid adaptation depends on the generation and positive selection of beneficial changes; and relies mainly on two molecular mechanisms: point mutations and genomic recombination [5\u20139]. Point mutations arise from the introduction of nucleotide changes by viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases that lack proofreading activity. In turn, genomic recombination does not produce new changes at the nucleotide level. Instead, the rearrangement of existing genomes creates novel lineages and strains and it has resulted in re-emergence of many RNA viruses.",

Explosive spread of CHIKV has been associated with adaptation of viral lineages to mosquito vector hosts that assured efficient transmission. For instance, the 2007 epidemics in La Reunion Island, which passed to the European continent, have been attributed to adaptive mutations within viral structural glycoproteins that allowed viruses to more readily infect the mosquito Aedes albopictus [15]. On the other hand, CHIKV strains that arrived to the Americas in December 2013 have been spread mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes [16] and do not contain this adaptive mutation. Instead, they have acquired nucleotide modifications in the non-structural proteins ORF and sequence duplications at the 3\u2019UTR [17].",

The 3\u2019UTR exhibits large size variations, including extensive substitutions, insertions and deletions, suggesting that it has evolved quickly, probably due to different evolutionary selective pressures. One interesting feature about CHIKV 3\u2019UTR is that it contains short sequence repetitions named direct repeats (DRs) [18,19]. Notably, copy number of DRs varies among ECSA (East, Central, and South African) and Asian lineages, indicating that the 3\u2019UTR diverged from a common ancestor that suffered historical events of duplication. Sequences of CHIKV DRs are relatively conserved between closely related lineages, indicating that they have functional significance [20]. The molecular bases that lead to CHIKV genetic diversity and to viral replacements in nature are not well understood. However, complex host-virus interactions could result in the transmission of only certain variants that exist in the viral population. In this regard, recent studies show that deletion of the repeated sequences reduces viral replication rate in mosquito cells but not in mammalian cells [17,21,22], suggesting that the DRs have host-specific functions. Nevertheless, the host selective pressures that act on these elements and their functional relevance in viral transmission are still poorly understood.",

In some cases, bottlenecks during natural transmission could constrain genetic diversity of viral populations to levels that lead to fixation of less adapted viruses.

            "text": "Sequence comparisons of RNA viruses from different groups show that those that must cycle between host species have a more diverse 3\u2019UTR than others with a single host [26]. In this regard, we have previously introduced the concept that 3\u2019UTR duplications of complex RNA structures provide mosquito-borne flaviviruses with the means to efficiently switch between hosts maintaining high viral fitness [27,28]. Here, based on the heterogeneity of the 3\u2019UTR of circulating CHIKV, we hypothesized that the number of sequence repetitions can change to accelerate viral adaptation during continuous host cycling. We found that the 3\u2019UTR of CHIKV populations is highly dynamic in cell culture and during the infection of laboratory mosquitoes, recapitulating the observations in natural isolates. Genetic diversity of viral populations depends both on CHIKV lineage and the infected host cell, indicating that CHIKV 3\u2019UTR is under conflicting selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that CHIKV uses genetic recombination at the 3\u2019UTR to generate virus populations with diverse 3\u2019UTRs. This strategy allows CHIKV to overcome bottlenecks in nature, driving the generation of new viral variants that rapidly replace the existing ones during adaptation to the host. Altogether, our findings provide important insights into the function of CHIKV 3\u2019UTR plasticity for host cell adaptation, pointing out a central role of RNA recombination on CHIKV ongoing evolution.",

In 2005, a CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage expanded the infection in La Reunion Island and then passed to the European continent. More recently, in 2016, a new autochthonous transmission of CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage was described in Brazil and Haiti [31\u201334]. ECSA-derived isolates contain simple 3\u2019UTRs, with only two copies of DR 1 and DR2 (Fig 1B). In contrast, Asian-derived isolates, which arrived to America in 2013, contain longer 3\u2019UTRs. Some American CHIKV isolates (such as the Caribbean) bear 3\u2019UTRs that have never before been described in nature [17]. These novel 3\u2019UTRs display a 177-nt duplication corresponding to the 3\u2019 portion of the DR(1+2)a region plus an extra copy of the complete DR(1+2)b region (Fig 1B). It has been proposed that this duplication confers an advantage for viral replication in mosquito cells compared to the original Asian strain [17].",

As mentioned, the CHIKV responsible for 2005\u20132006 epidemics in La Reunion Island (CHIKV-LR; ECSA-derived) contained a single mutation in the envelope protein gene (E1-A226V) that increases viral fitness in Aedes albopictus [15,35], which is not present in the CHIKV that arrived to America [CHIKV-Caribbean (Cbn); Asian-derived]. Besides, both linages largely differ at their 3\u2019UTRs. To identify sequence repetitions at the 3\u2019UTR from these two distinct re-emergent viruses, RNA matrix comparisons were performed. Local alignment plots confirm the presence of multiple DRs at both 3\u2019UTRs, but with distinct repetition patterns (Fig 2A). Firstly, we studied the impact of distinct 3\u2019UTRs on replication by comparing growth kinetics of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn in mammalian (BHK and human fibroblasts) and mosquito cells. Growth curves in mammalian cells showed that both viruses replicated similarly, despite a slight advantage of CHIKV-LR over the CHIKV-Cbn for replication in human fibroblasts (Fig 2B). In contrast, CHIKV-Cbn exhibited enhanced growth kinetics in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells, resulting in 10-fold higher titers compared to CHIKV-LR. To assess the contribution of the 3\u2019UTR to the differential behavior in insect cells, we designed chimeras containing the 3\u2019UTR from CHIKV-LR in the context of the CHIKV-Cbn genome and vice versa. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts from parental and chimeric viruses were individually transfected into BHK or C6/36 cells. Then, virus replication was monitored by immunofluorescence as a function of time and virus growth curves (Fig 2C). In BHK cells, similar levels of replication were observed for parental and chimeric viruses of both LR and Cbn lineages, demonstrating that neither the virus backbone nor the 3\u2019UTR play lineage specific functions and that the 3\u2019UTR may be swapped between viral isolates. On the other hand, in mosquito cells the 3\u2019UTR from CHIKV-Cbn provided CHIKV-LR a net advantage for replication, displaying increased percentage of infected cells at two days after transfection and enhanced growth kinetics compared to the parental virus (Fig 2C). In contrast, the 3\u2019UTR from CHIKV-LR disfavored replication of CHIKV-Cbn in the same cell line (Fig 2C). So far, our results indicate that CHIKV-Cbn contains a 3\u2019UTR advantageous for viral replication in C6/36 cells but without benefit for replication in different mammalian cells.",

We first followed the evolution of the 3\u2019UTR of viruses restricted to replicate in mammalian or mosquito cells. Viral RNA molecules were obtained by in vitro transcription from CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone and used to transfect C6/36 and BHK cell lines in two parallel experiments (Fig 3A). Viruses recovered from the transfection supernatants were serially passaged in mosquito or mammalian cells. Then, total RNA was extracted from culture supernatants and used as a template for reverse transcription reactions with an oligo(dT) primer. The pool of viral cDNAs was used to amplify fragments corresponding to the 3\u2019UTR ends and then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. Individual plasmid clones were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced using Sanger method. Also, the 3\u2019UTR from in vitro transcribed input RNA was RT-PCR amplified, cloned, and used as reference.",

Interestingly, the CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells showed a more drastic change in the composition of viral population (Fig 3A, bottom gel). A reduction of the input variant frequency from 100% to 41% and the emergence of new 3\u2019UTRs with a frequency of about 60% were observed (Fig 3B, bottom chart). Sequencing of 3\u2019UTR variants revealed that they contained deletions of DR regions located at different positions of the 3\u2019UTR (Fig 3C, 13 clones for each sample are shown). For instance, in mosquito cell passaged viruses we found a clean deletion of DR(1+2)a in Clone 6 and a deletion of DR3b in Clone 12. In mammalian cells, viral variants with different deletions throughout the 3\u2019UTR appeared in the first experiment. In the second experiment, the majority of the variants isolated carried the same deletion, corresponding to one copy of DR3. In addition to deletion variants, a viral variant with an 80-nt insertion emerged in cell culture (clone 5). Nucleotide sequences of variants are shown in S1 and S2 Figs.",

Instead, Clone 15, which carried the complete deletion of both DR3 copies, was not able to replicate neither in mammalian nor mosquito cells (Fig 3D).

            "text": "Viral variants carrying deletions at their 3\u2019UTR appeared in CHIKV populations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for the generation of these new viral variants. It is accepted that RNA recombination contributes to genetic diversity of many RNA viruses, impacting on their evolution, epidemiology and re-emergence [6,36]. RNA deletions are often generated during RNA recombination by a copy-choice mechanism. This process involves dissociation of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and the nascent strand from the RNA template, and their re-association at a different position of either the original RNA or template switch to a homologous RNA, guided by sequence similarities (Fig 4A, i and ii, respectively). Template switching from a donor to an acceptor strand generates a chimeric RNA molecule. Given the fact that CHIKV contains various copies of sequence repetitions at its 3\u2019UTR, we reasoned that 3\u2019 variability could be originated by a copy-choice mechanism. To differentiate between re-association on the same or an alternative template molecule, we introduced point mutations into CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone in order to generate recognition sites for two unique restriction enzymes at the boundaries of the 3\u2019UTR. Thus, when the RNA marked with the restriction sites is mixed with parental unmarked RNA, recombination between homologous RNAs by template switching will generate a chimeric 3\u2019UTR carrying only one of the marker sites. We engineered SacI and NheI restriction sites at positions 1\u20136 and 858\u2013863 after the translation stop codon. The recombinant CHIKV-Cbn SacI/NheI was infective in both mammalian and mosquito cells (Fig 4B). To visualize the presence of SacI and NheI sites, fragments corresponding to the last 1,500 nucleotides of the viral genome were obtained by PCR and separately digested with the two restriction enzymes (S3 Fig). The fragment amplified from the recombinant virus was sensitive to both SacI and NheI digestion, and the introduced mutations were stable in cell culture even after 5 successive passages (Fig 4B, right panels). Then, to evaluate template-switching events, equal amounts of RNA transcripts for the parental and CHIKV-Cbn SacI/NheI were co-transfected into cultured cells. At day 3 after transfection, total RNA was extracted from culture media, used as a template for reverse transcription reactions and cloned. The presence of SacI and NheI sites was assessed by enzymatic digestion of PCR products amplified from individual clones. For confirmation, the 3\u2019UTRs were also sequenced and relative abundances of viral variants were calculated. About 15% and 50% of the viruses recovered from mosquito and mammalian cells, respectively, contained full-length 3\u2019UTRs with only one of the two restriction sites (Fig 4C and 4D). The emergence of these new recombinant variants, that were absent in the input mixture of RNAs, strongly suggests that they were products of a template switching mechanism generated by a polymerase that jumped from a RNA to the same position of a homologous RNA.",

To examine the requirements of DRs for replication in mammalian and mosquito cells we have deleted one, two or three copies of DR (1+2) or one DR3 copy from the CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone [\u0394(1+2)a, \u0394(1+2)ab, \u0394(1+2)abb\u2019, \u03943a respectively; Fig 5A]. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts for WT and mutant genomes were transfected into cells, and replication was followed by immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens as a function of time. We observed a direct association between the number of DRs and viral replication in mosquito cells. While deletion of one DR(1+2) copy had no effect compared to the WT, deletion of two or three DR(1+2) copies resulted in a moderate and a clear disadvantage for replication in mosquito cells, respectively (Fig 5A). One day post-transfection, the number of CHIKV positive cells were 33%, 35%, 5% and 0% for WT, \u0394(1+2)a, \u0394(1+2)ab and \u0394(1+2)abb\u2019, respectively. By day 4 post-transfection, the complete cell monolayer was infected with all viruses except for \u0394(1+2)abb\u2019; which only infected 10% of the cells. Because replication of \u0394(1+2)abb\u2019 virus was only evident after 10 days, we asked whether the virus recovered at this time showed any evidence of recombination at the 3\u2019UTR. Analysis of clones corresponding to the \u0394(1+2)abb\u2019 population showed that the 3\u2019UTR remained stable, suggesting that a minimum of DR copies may be maintained to favor recombination. In agreement with the immunofluorescence results, assessment of virus replication by growth curves showed that \u0394(1+2)ab and \u0394(1+2)abb\u2019 exhibited delayed replication kinetics, resulting in 300 and 10,000 fold lower titers as compared to the WT, respectively (Fig 5A). Deletion of one DR3 copy was also evaluated in mosquito cells and it was found to delay viral replication, with 10% of the monolayer infected at day 1 and 100-fold reduction in viral titer compared to the WT. Replication of all mutants and WT viruses was similarly investigated in mammalian cells and interestingly, deletion of DR copies had no significant effect on viral fitness (Fig 5A, bottom panel; and S4 Fig). Taken together, our results indicate a remarkable difference for replication requirements in mosquito and mammalian cells, with an evident positive correlation between the number of DR copies and replication rates in mosquito cells. In addition, DR(1+2) copies cannot compensate for the deletion of DR3, suggesting that DR(1+2) and DR3 copies are functionally different. In fact, DR1 and DR2 do not fold into stable RNA structures. Because DR3 folds into a stable SLY (Fig 1D), it is tempting to speculate that this structure plays a role on viral replication in mosquito cells.",

Since redundant DR copies do not provide an advantage for viral replication in mammalian cells, selection of viruses that rapidly loose DR copies is favored. On the other hand, duplication of DRs enhances replication in mosquito cells and thus, there is a positive selection pressure on DRs that explains the lower frequency of deletion variants in this host. We reasoned that host switch by alternate passaging of the virus in mammalian and mosquito cells would impact on the frequency of deletion variants. The CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells, where 64% of the viruses bear deletions in the 3\u2019UTR was used to infect mosquito cells (Host Switch I, Fig 6A). Then, the 3'UTR of individual clones was analyzed as described previously (see Fig 3). As expected, the 3\u2019UTR from the viral progeny released from mosquito cells showed a drastic change in the composition of viral population, with a prevailing of parental CHIKV-Cbn at a frequency of 85%. In addition, the viral variants that had arisen during adaptation to mammalian cells (Experiment II in Fig 3C) changed their frequency from 64% to 5%, and new mosquito-adapted variants emerged at a frequency of 10% (in orange, Fig 6A). Interestingly, when this mosquito-grown population was switched back to mammalian cells such as BHK or human fibroblasts (Host Switch II and III, Fig 6A), the deletion variants became nearly 60% of the population.",

            "text": "Here, we followed the evolution of CHIKV 3\u2019UTR during viral transmission with the aim of deciphering the significance of sequence repetitions for virus adaptation. Our experiments reveal that populations of CHIKV are greatly dynamic and the copy number of sequence repetitions at the 3\u2019UTR varies continuously when the virus shuttles from mosquito to mammalian cells. Indeed, sequence repetitions act as functional blocks that are gained or lost during cycling to accelerate viral adaptability. Interestingly, duplication of complex RNA structures is a common feature of the 3\u2019UTR among other RNA viruses that must cycle between hosts [26,37]. However, we have only recently obtained experimental insights into the function of duplicated structures for DENV, showing that duplication of a 3\u2019 structure is beneficial in mammalian cells [27]. Here we uncovered the requirements and the underlying mechanism that maintain sequence duplications during CHIKV host cycling. Although there are evidences that support that sequence duplications at the 3\u2019UTR provide RNA viruses with the means to replicate in hosts with conflicting demands, our results highlight the differences related to viral biology. We propose a model where RNA recombination and natural selection act concertedly to shape the composition of CHIKV populations (Fig 8). One example is the outcome of CHIKV-Cbn experimental adaptation to mammalian cells (see experiment II in Fig 3), where the same deletion variant was isolated with high frequency. This can be explained by an early single recombination event followed by positive selection during passaging in cell culture.",

            "text": "RNA recombination is driven by blocks of repeated sequences and is the main mechanism underlying genome plasticity at the 3\u2019UTR in both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While positive selection favors the replication of advantageous viral variants, RNA-recombination does not always produce beneficial rearrangements of the viral genome. In fact, RNA recombination yields both viable viruses and non-replicative viral RNAs that are packaged into defective interfering particles [38] [see Fig 8A) and 8B)]. The Cbn strain missing DR3a and DR3b copies isolated in BHK cells is an example of those non-replicative RNAs. In turn, viable viruses are subjected to positive selection processes in each host, according to specific requirements for viral replication. Direct repeats at the 3\u2019UTR are under different host-selective pressures. While they are advantageous for replication in mosquito cells, they are rather redundant in mammalian cells. These conflicting requirements explain why viral variants enriched in DR copies are positively selected in mosquito cells, and then cleared out when the virus switches to mammalian cells. However, the cause for selection of viral variants with disparate 3\u2019UTRs in different hosts still remains unclear. In the case of DENV, we discovered that host adaptation modulates the species of non-coding RNAs derived from the 3\u2019UTR (known as sfRNA) that are accumulated in infected cells [28]. A number of studies have revealed important functions of sfRNAs, including the evasion of immune responses [39,40]. Evidence so far suggests that during CHIKV infection no sfRNAs are produced [41]. In turn, alphavirus 3\u2019UTR in the context of the complete viral genome appears to be the target for antiviral responses in mammalian cells: (i) CHIKV 3\u2019UTR is specifically recognized by RIG-I receptors, that sense viral infection to initiate and modulate antiviral immunity [42] and (ii) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) contains at its 3\u2019UTR a binding site for a vertebrate-cell specific miRNA that restricts viral replication [43]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that loss of DR copies at the 3\u2019UTR serves as a mechanism to evade host antiviral response in mammalian cells. Future work is required to elucidate whether immune escape is the driving force for CHIKV 3\u2019UTR evolution.",

Multifactorial circumstances (i.e. vector genetic variations, composition of viral populations, and specific mosquito/virus interactions) could influence the bottleneck size and viral genetic diversity. Following this line of thought, we explain the evolution of CHIKV during host switch under two possible scenarios: \u201ctight\u201d or \u201cwide\u201d genetic bottlenecks. In light of our experiments, we propose that under \u201cwide\u201d genetic bottlenecks the mammalian-adapted population undergoes a purifying selection to remove the variants with lower fitness in mosquitoes. On the other hand, \u201ctight\u201d genetic bottlenecks reduce genetic diversity. Variants with higher fitness in mosquitoes are underrepresented in the mammalian-adapted population and may not go through the bottleneck, posing a constraint to viral replication. In this scenario, RNA recombination can generate new viral variants that are positively selected in mosquitoes, working as an efficient strategy to rescue CHIKV from \u201ctight\u201d genetic bottlenecks or even providing an advantage for viral replication [Fig 8(C) and 8(D)].",

Comparable effects of 3\u2019UTR deletions on CHIKV replication were also observed in C6/36 cells and mosquitoes (Figs 5A,6A and Fig 6B). Overall, our study confirms previous reports showing the requirement for repeated DR elements for efficient replication in mosquito [17,21,22]. Notably, contrarily to deletion of the two DR3 repeats in the Asian lineage (21), we found that a similar deletion in the Caribbean lineage of CHIKV (see Fig 3D) did not produce infectious viruses after transfection into cultured cells, suggesting that some requirements for viral replication might be lineage specific.",

Products from RNA recombination are proposed to impact on viral evolution and adaptation [56\u201358]. A strong evidence of alphavirus recombination is the emergence of Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), which arose from a recombination event between Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and a Sindbis-like virus. Also, RNA recombination at the 3\u2019UTR of Sindbis virus (SINV) has already been reported, where the conserved sequence element CSE along with the poly (A) tail have been proposed to play a role. Contrarily to our findings with CHIKV, RNA recombination of SINV RNA is not dependent on sequence homology. Instead, cryptic polymerase recognition motifs promote non-homologous template switching between viral and non-viral templates [59,60]. It appears that, although stimulated by different RNA determinants, RNA recombination is a founding mechanism that generates diversity at alphaviruses 3\u2019UTR.",

            "text": "For many RNA polymerases, biochemical studies have been performed in order to explore template requirements for homologous RNA recombination, without the bias generated by selection of RNAs that are more competent for replication [54,61]. The strength of base pairing regions between the donor and the acceptor RNA strands is believed to modulate genome propensity for this process. In this regard, not all viral variants have the potential to generate diversity through RNA recombination. For instance, previous studies show that CHIKV-La Reunion carrying the deletion of both DR1 and both DR2 copies does not introduce changes at the 3\u2019UTR during adaptation. Instead, it acquires compensatory mutations in protein coding regions, so as to improve viral fitness in mosquito cells [22]. It seems reasonable that a minimum number of DR copies should be maintained to drive RNA recombination between homologous strands. Here, although bearing certain sequence variations, we have detected recombination events when viruses containing the 3\u2019UTR from different CHIKV lineages coexist in the same cell. During outbreaks, coinfections of mosquitoes and patients with different arboviruses have been extensively documented, supporting the notion that simultaneous exposure of mosquitoes to multiple arboviruses during one feeding episode is highly frequent [[62\u201365], for review see [66]]. Given the fact that ECSA and Asian derived lineages co-circulate in the same geographic areas [17,31\u201334], we propose that RNA recombination may occur in mosquitoes that are simultaneously infected with different CHIKV lineages, resulting in the emergence of new viral variants. The ability of viral genomes to recombine within mosquitoes could clearly have implications on CHIKV epidemiology and evolution.",

(B) To mark the CHIKV-Cbn RNA, SacI and NheI restriction sites were introduced at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the viral 3\u2019UTR, respectively. Immunofluorescence of Cbn-WT and Cbn-SacI/NheI viruses were performed in BHK and C6/36 cells. Viral RNA was recovered from the supernatant, and fragments corresponding to the last ~1,500 nucleotides of the viral genome were obtained by RT-PCR, digested with SacI and NheI restriction enzymes and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Undigested (-) and digested (+) products are shown on the right panel for parental (WT) and marked (SacI/NheI) viruses. Also, we show the digested products for one representative individual clone of SacI/NheI virus containing full-length 3\u2019UTR, which was isolated after 5 passages in C6/36 cells (red asterisks). For P5, 20 clones were tested and they all conserved both SacI and NheI restriction sites. (C and D) Cbn-WT and Cbn-SacI/NheI RNAs were co-transfected at a 1:1 ratio into C6/36 and BHK cells, in duplicates. At 72hpt, supernatants were harvested, subjected to RT-PCR and blunt-end cloned. For each experiment, 14 individual clones were subjected to PCR reactions, enzymatic digestion, and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. To illustrate, undigested and digested products from 7 representative clones are shown. Depending on the orientation of each inserted fragment into the blunt plasmid, digestion of SacI positive clones generated 430 or 372 nucleotide-length products and digestion of NheI positive clones generated 186 or 146 nucleotide-length products. Presence of SacI and/or NheI restriction sites are indicated with yellow and light blue stars, respectively. Individual clones are also schematized and deletions are indicated with orange and red lines. Recombinant clones generated by template switching between strands are indicated with a R.

Under this scenario, RNA recombination might act as an efficient mechanism to generate more competent viral variants that are positively selected rescuing viral replication.",
