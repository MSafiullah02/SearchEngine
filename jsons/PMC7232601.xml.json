[1], conceptualizing \u2018type L\u2019 and \u2018type H\u2019 (typical acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) phenotypes for COVID-19.\nWe hypothesize that what the authors label a type L phenotype is actually a typical Stage 2/Stage 3 of COVID-19 pneumonia [2]. Like any other pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia can result in complications like severe ARDS; we believe that referring to this as a \u2018type H phenotype\u2019 may lead to confusion. Furthermore, we are hesitant to accept the authors\u2019 hypothesis concerning the mechanism of hypoxia in the so-called type L phenotype. Here is our reasoning.",

            "text": "Gattinoni et al. proposed pulmonary vasoplegia as a key mechanism for the onset of severe hypoxia, but failed to give any plausible mechanism for this vasoplegia. We instead propose a \u2018epithelial\u2013endothelial crosstalk\u2019 hypothesis that may provide a better explanation for the different stages of COVID-19 pneumonia:i.Downregulation of ACE-2 on type II alveolar epithelial cellsSARS-CoV-2 enters the type II alveolar epithelial cells following binding of its spike protein to the ACE-2 receptor. This causes ACE-2 downregulation on the alveolar epithelium. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 seems to produce little or no direct cytopathic changes in the pulmonary epithelium [3].ii.Endothelial dysfunctionThe downregulation of ACE-2 on pulmonary epithelium results in unopposed effects of ACE-1 on the pulmonary capillary endothelial cells. Consequently, the level of protective ACE2-Ang 1\u20137-mas-R activity is reduced, while the level of harmful ACE 1-Ang II-AT1-R activity is increased. Possibly, the earliest deleterious effect of ACE 1-Ang II-AT1-R overactivity is the release of a potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1, from the pulmonary endothelium. ACE2-Ang 1\u20137-mas-R mediated constitutive endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activation, and NO release is inhibited [4]. The intense pulmonary vasoconstriction so developed is severe, but uneven and results in the recruitment of capillary beds with relatively less vasoconstriction. As a result, the shunt fraction is increased and severe hypoxia ensues. As the disruption of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier progresses, proteins, fibrin, cells and fluid leak into the alveolar space, resulting in bilateral patchy ground glass opacities on CT scan.",
