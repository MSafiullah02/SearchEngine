(3) The co-evolution of pathogens and their hosts allows for transferring knowledge across the two interacting species and affords valuable insights into how evolution works, in general.

Due to a strong immune response in the host, which clears the virus within a few days, the virus can only survive by moving on quickly. Following an infection, hosts retain strong immunity to a particular antigenic type. As immunity accumulates in the population, there is increasing selection for pathogens with altered antigenic types that are less effectively recognized and thus have a higher probability of finding a susceptible host. By rapid evolution influenza is able to persist at relatively high prevalence in the human population. Consequently, vaccines must be frequently updated to ensure a good match with the circulating strain. However, even with current vaccination programs, endemic influenza remains a significant burden and is associated with an estimated 37,000 deaths in the U.S. alone.",

Hemagglutinin is responsible for binding to sugar structures on the ephithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and entry into the cell during the first stage of infection. Neuraminidase plays a part in releasing assembled viral particles from an infected cell by cleaving terminal sugar structures from neighboring glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface. Several subtypes of influenza A are distinguished on the basis of the antigenic properties of the HA and NA proteins. There are 16 known subtypes for HA and 9 for NA, all of which occur in birds.

This occurs at a higher rate than for DNA-based viruses, as RNA polymerases do not possess a proof-reading mechanism. Some of these changes subsequently become fixed in the viral sequence, either through the random fixation process of genetic drift or because they confer a selective advantage. This gradual change and its impact on the phenotype level is referred to as antigenic drift. The second mechanism of evolution is reassortment (see Fig. 1 ). If two different strains simultaneously infect the same host, a novel strain may arise with a combination of segments from the two. The phenotypic change associated with the emergence of such a viral variant is referred to as antigenic shift.",

Whether primed by infection or vaccination, antibodies provide long lasting immunity to that particular HA configuration. However, due to antigenic drift within just a few years those antibodies do not efficiently recognize the circulating HA. Influenza vaccines must thus be regularly updated and re-administered. The WHO makes vaccine recommendations based on the prevalence of recently circulating strains. If a new genotype, based on the HA segment, appears to be increasing in prevalence, then hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays using post infection ferret sera are carried out to determine whether this is associated with phenotypic change in terms of the antigenicity. If there is significant phenotypic change, the current vaccine is unlikely to be effective against the proposed emergent strain and must be updated. The genotypephenotype map for influenza virus is unclear and genotyping is only used to choose candidate strains for HI assays. However, recent advances have indicated several ways in which genome-based methods may improve vaccine selection. 2 Phylogenetic tree for the influenza HA coding sequences constructed by maximum parsimony using the software PAUP (http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/) from the sequences of 507 viruses isolated between 1983 and 2007. Dates to the right of the tree indicate the year that the majority of sequences contributing to that section were isolated. The tree has a distinctive cactus like shape characterized by constant turnover and limited diversity at any point in time Bioinformatic analyses of the hemagglutinin encoding sequences have revealed characteristics of the evolutionary process and also determined relevant properties with respect to viral fitness. Phylogenetic trees of these sequences have a cactus-like topology (see Fig. 2 ). A diverse strain repertoire is periodically replaced by just a single strain, which constitutes the progenitor for all future lineages (Fitch et al. 1997) . Population genetic theory states that such trees can be derived by random genetic drift if population size becomes very small or by selection if fitter variants emerge and periodically replace all others.",

Further pandemics are considered inevitable unless their origin can be rapidly detected or, better still, predicted (Taubenberger et al. 2007 ). Whole genome analysis has shown that the 1968 and 1957 pandemic strains were reassortants that introduced avian HA, PB1 and, in 1957 NA, segments into viruses already circulating in, and adapted to, the human population. The antigenic novelty of the 1918 pandemic strain also stems from its introduction from an avian source.

            "text": "The human immune system rests basically on two pillars. One pillar is solely genetically determined and remains unchanged throughout the life of an individual. This so-called innate immune system basically provides physical protection barriers and registers if generally recognizable foreign substances are entering the organism. If such substances are detected a fast and general protection mechanism sets in whose nature is determined by the type of substance registered. The innate protection mechanisms also include an activation of the other pillar of the immune system, the adaptive immune system. This part evolves during the life, and its present state is highly dependent of the infection history of the individual. The adaptive immune system is itself basically split up in two parts. First the humoral immunity, which happens outside cells within the body liquids and is antibody-driven. Special immunoglobulin molecules (antibodies) mediate the humoral response. Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes that bind to antigens by their immunoglobulin receptors, which is a membrane bound form of the antibodies. When the B lymphocytes become activated, they start to secrete the soluble form of the receptor in large amounts. Antibodies are Y-shaped, and each of the two branches functions independently and can be recombinantly produced and is then known as fragments of antibodies (Fab). The antibody can coat the surface of an antigen such as a virus and generally this will inactivate whatever undesired function the respective object may have, and facilitate the uptake of the antibody-bound object via phagocytosis by macrophages, which will then digest the object. Macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells are all so-called professional antigen presenting cells (APC). They carry a special receptor named the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. This receptor is able to present peptides derived from degraded phagocytosed proteins. Other cells (T cells) carries a receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR), which, if the T cell also carries a so called CD4\u00fe receptor, is able to bind to MHC class II molecules presenting a foreign peptide, e.g. one not originating from the human proteome. Such an interaction will stimulate B cells to divide and further progress to produce more antibodies as well as survive for a long time as memory B cells. The presence of memory B cells enables the immune system to react faster in a subsequent infection by the same pathogen. The CD4\u00fe T cells actually also belong to the second part of the adaptive immune system, which is the cellular immune system. Another important feature of cellular immunity regards T cells with the CD8 coreceptor (CD8\u00fe T cells). The TCR of CD8\u00fe T cells can recognize foreign peptides in complex with membrane bound MHC class I molecules on the outer side of nucleated cells. Such an interaction will activate the T cells to signal and induce cell death of the cell presenting the foreign peptide. Both antibodies and TCRs are composed of a light and a heavy chain. These chains are translated from genes resulting from a genetic recombination of two and three genes, respectively, during the B-cell development in the bone marrow. These genes exist in several nonidentical duplicates on the chromosome and can be combined into a large number of different rearrangements. However, the molecular processes linking the genes are imprecise and involve generation of P (palindromic) nucleotides, addition of N (non-templated) nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and trimming of the gene ends and therefore also play a major role in the generation of the huge diversity needed to be able to respond to any given pathogen. The T cells having a mature TCR are being validated in the thymus. The host will eliminate T cells having a TCR that is either unable to bind to an MHC:peptide complex or that will recognize an MHC with a peptide originating from the hosts proteome (self peptides). All the above is highly simplified text book immunology (Janeway 2005) .",

The specific parts of the pathogen that is recognized and induces an immune response are called epitopes. Epitopes are often parts of larger macromolecules, which most often happen to be polypeptides and proteins. B-cell epitopes are normally classified into two groups: continuous and discontinuous epitopes. A continuous epitope, (also called a sequential or linear epitope) is a short peptide fragment in an antigen that is recognized by antibodies specific for the given antigen. A discontinuous epitope is composed of residues that are not adjacent in the amino acid sequence, but are brought into proximity by the folding of the polypeptide.",

            "text": "The cellular arm of the immune system consists as desribed of two parts; the CD8\u00fe cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and the CD4\u00fe helper T lymphocytes (HTLs). CTLs destroy cells that present non-self peptides (epitopes). HTLs are needed for B cells activation and proliferation to produce antibodies against a given antigen. CTLs on the other hand perform surveillance of the host cells, and recognize and kill infected cells. Both CTLs and HTLs are raised against peptides that are presented to the immune cells by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are encoded in the most polymorphic mammalian genes. The human versions of MHCs are referred to as the human leucocyte antigens (HLA). The cells of an individual are constantly screened for presented peptides by the cellular arm of the immune system. In the MHC class I pathway, class I MHCs presents endogenous peptides to T cells carrying the CD8 receptor (CD8\u00fe T cells). To be presented, a precursor peptide is normally first generated by cutting endogenous produced proteins inside the proteasome, a cytosolic protease complex. Generally, resulting peptides should bind to the TAP complex for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During or after the transport into the ER the peptide must be able to bind to the MHC class I molecule to invoke folding of the MHC before the complex can be transported to the cell surface. When the peptide:MHC complex is presented on the surface of the cell, it might bind to a CD8\u00fe T cell with a fitting TCR. If such a TCR clone exists a CTL response will be induced and the peptide is considered an epitope. The most selective step in this pathway is binding of a peptide to the MHC class I molecule. As mentioned above, the MHC is the most polymorphic gene system known. The huge variety of protein variants brought forth by this polymorphism is a big challenge for T-cell epitope discoveries, enhancing the need for bioinformatical analysis and resources. It also highly complicates immunological bioinformatics, as predictive methods for peptide MHC binding have to deal with the diverse genetic background of different populations and individuals. On a population basis, hundreds of alleles (gene variants) have been found for most of the HLA encoding loci (1839 in release 2.17.0 of the IMGT/HLA Database, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/). In a given individual either one or two different alleles are expressed per locus depending on whether the same (in homozygous individuals) or two different (in heterozygous individuals) alleles are present on the two different chromosomes. Each MHC allele binds a very restricted set of peptides and the polymorphism affects the peptide binding specificity of the MHC; one MHC will recognize one part of the peptide space, whereas another MHC will recognize a different part of this space. The very large number of different MHC alleles makes reliable identification of potential epitope candidates an immense task if all alleles are to be included in the search. Many MHC alleles, however, share a large fraction of their peptidebinding repertoire and it is often possible to find promiscuous peptides, which bind to a number of different HLA alleles. The problem can thus be largely reduced by grouping all the different alleles into supertypes in a manner were all the alleles within a given supertype have roughly the same peptide specificity. This grouping generally requires some knowledge regarding the binding repertoire of either the specific allele or an allele with a very similar amino acid sequence.",

The Ii chain is a type II membrane protein, and unlike MHC molecules the C-terminal part of the molecule extends into the lumen of the ER. The MHC:Ii complex accumulates in endosomal compartments and here, Ii is degraded, while another MHC-like molecule, called HLA-DM in humans, loads the MHC class II molecules with the best available ligands originating from endocytosed antigens.

It is also possible to identify the vast majority of the relevant epitopes in rather complex organisms using class I MHC binding predictions and only have to test a very minor fraction of the possible peptides in the virus proteome itself.

            "text": "B-cell epitope prediction is a highly challenging field due to the fact that the vast majority of antibodies raised against a specific protein interact with parts of the antigen that are discontinuous in the polypeptide sequence. The prediction of continuous, or linear, epitopes, however, is a somewhat simpler problem, and may be still useful for synthetic vaccines or as diagnostic tools. Moreover, the determination of continuous epitopes can be integrated into determination of discontinuous epitopes, as these often contain linear stretches. More successful methods combine scores from the Parker hydrophilicity scale and a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) trained on linear epitopes. Different experimental techniques can be used to define conformational epitopes. Probably the most accurate and easily defined is using the solved structures of antibody-antigen complexes. Unfortunately, the amount of this kind of data is still scarce, compared to linear epitopes. Furthermore, for very few antigens all possible epitopes have been identified. The simplest way to predict the possible epitopes in a protein of known 3D structure is to use the knowledge of surface accessibility and newer methods using protein structure and surface exposure for prediction of B-cell epitopes have been developed. The CEP method calculates the relative accessible surface area (RSA) for each residue in the structure. The RSA is defined as the fraction of solvent exposed surface of a given amino acid in the native structure relative to the exposed surface the same amino acid placed centrally in a tri-peptide, usually flanked by glycines or alanines. It is then determined which areas of the protein are exposed enough to be antigenic determinants. Regions that are distant in the primary sequence, but close in three-dimensional space will be considered as a single epitope. DiscoTope (www.cbs. dtu.dk/services/DiscoTope) uses a combination of amino acid statistics, spatial information and surface exposure. The system is trained on a compiled dataset of discontinuous epitopes from 76 X-ray structures of antibody-antigen protein complexes. (Haste Andersen et al. 2006 ). B-cell epitope mapping can be performed experimentally by other methods than structure determination, e.g., by phage display. The low sequence similarity between the mimotope (i.e. a macromolecule, often a peptide, which mimics the structure of an epitope) identified through phage display and the antigen complicates the mapping back onto the native structure of the antigen, however, a number of methods have been developed that facilitate this.",

            "text": "A number of methods for predicting the binding of peptides to MHC molecules have been developed. The majority of peptides binding to MHC class I molecules have a length of 8-10 amino acids. Position 2 and the C-terminal position have turned out generally to be very important for the binding to most class I MHCs and these positions are referred to as anchor positions (Fig. 3) . For some alleles, the binding motifs have additional anchor positions. E.g., eptides binding to the human HLA-A \u00c3 0101 allele have positions 2, 3 and 9 as anchors (Rammensee et al. 1999) (Fig. 1A) . The discovery of such allele-specific motifs led to the development of the first reasonably accurate algorithms. In these prediction tools, it is assumed that the amino acids at each position along the peptide sequence contribute a given binding energy, which can be added up to yield the overall binding energy of the peptide. Several of these matrix methods are trained on exclusively positive examples like peptides eluted from MHCs on living cells, peptides that have been shown to induce significant interferon gamma responses in CTL assays, or peptides that bind the MHC more strongly than a certain binding affinity value (usually below 500 nM). Other matrix methods, like the SMM method, aim at predicting an actual affinity and thus use exclusively affinity data. However, matrixbased methods cannot take correlated effects into account (when the binding affinity of peptide with a given amino acid at one position depends on amino acids that are present at other positions in the peptide). Higher-order methods like ANNs and SVMs are ideally suited for taking such correlations into account and can be trained with data either in the format of binder/non-binder classification, or with real affinity data. Some of the recent methods combine the two types of data and prediction methods. The different types of predictors are reviewed in ) and an extensive benchmark of the performances of the different algorithms have been published by (Peters et al. 2006) .",

As a result MHC class II binding peptides have a broader length distribution even though the part of the binding peptide that interacts with the MHC molecule (the binding core) still includes only 9 amino acid residues. This complicate binding predictions as the identification of the correct alignment of the binding core is a crucial part of identifying the MHC class II binding motif. The MHC class II binding motifs have relatively weak and often degenerate sequence signals. While some alleles like HLA-DRB1 positions. In addition, there are other issues affecting the predictive performance of most MHC class II binding prediction methods. The majority of these methods take as a fundamental assumption that the peptide:MHC binding affinity is determined solely by the nine amino acids in binding core motif. This is clearly a large oversimplification since it is known that peptide flanking residues (PFR) on both sides of the binding core may contribute to the binding affinity and stability. Some methods for MHC class II binding have attempted to include PFRs indirectly, in terms of the peptide length, in the prediction of binding affinities. It has been demonstrated that these PFRs indeed improve the prediction accuracy (Nielsen et al. 2007b ).",

Current influenza vaccines are based on inactivated influenza virus and thus mimic only the B cell response obtained by a fully infection competent strain. This has the drawback that only closely related strains will be covered by this response and new vaccines have to be produced annually as a result of the antigenic drift (see Sect. 2). Thus the ideal influenza vaccine will raise an immune response against parts of the pathogen that are conserved between as many strains as possible. To identify these parts the described prediction tools will be an invaluable help. Initial in silico scans of the viral genome for potential immunogenic parts will reduce the potential epitope space, and thus make experimental validations feasible. In a published example all genomic sequenced strains of H1N1 were scanned for CTL epitopes. Only 9-mer peptides in the influenza proteome that were at least 70% conserved in all strains were considered. The top 15 predicted epitopes for each of the 12 supertypes were subsequently selected to be synthesized for further validation. Because of the limited size of the influenza genome and the high variability of some of the proteins the conservation criteria resulted in relatively low prediction scores of some of the chosen peptides. 180 peptides were selected and 167 were synthesized and further validated for MHC binding and CTL response. The fraction of validated MHC binding peptides (with a binding affinity of below 500 nM) was relatively low (about 50%) compared to some other studies (60-75%) (Sundar et al. 2007; Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2004 ), but 13 of the 89 binding peptides, or 15%, gave a positive output in a CTL recall assay. Obviously, the conserved epitopes were found in the less variable proteins, but the large majority of the validated epitopes (85%) turned out to be 100% conserved not only in H1N1 strains but also in the H5N1 avian strains that in the last few years have infected humans resulting in severe symptoms and high mortality (Wang et al. 2007 ). Such epitopes can be highly valuable starting points for vaccine development. Even though cellular immunity does not protect against infections it might protect against a fatal outcome of an infection with a new aggressive strain.",

Another viral enzyme, the Integrase (IN) splices the DNA version of the viral genome, the so-called provirus, into the genome of the infected host cell. This cell is often a T-helper cell of the hosts immune system.

These drugs are called nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTIs). Another class of drugs targeting RT, the non-nucleoside analogs (NNRTIs), facilitate inhibition of the enzyme by binding to a specific part of its binding pocket. Since the mid 90s, inhibitors of PR (PIs) that substitute for the peptides to be cleaved by the enzyme have entered the market place. Inhibitors of integrase are just about to come to market. Finally, in recent years, several drugs have been developed that target the blockage of the process of viral cell entry, by blocking one of the involved proteins, either the viral surface protein gp41, or one of the cellular proteins, CD4, CCR5 or CXCR4. Within the older classes of drugs there are up to about a dozen different compounds in each class. The justification for so many compounds is that there are many different variants of HIV that have different resistance profiles. This is also the reason why, for over ten years, the so-called highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART) approach administers several drugs from several drug classes to the patient simultaneously, in order to present a high barrier for the virus on its evolutionary path to resistance. Still, after a time of several weeks up to about a year or two, the virus succeeds in evolving a variant that is resistant against the given therapy regimen. At this point, a new drug combination has to be selected to combat the new viral variant.",

For instance, a mutation can resensitize a virus to a drug to which an earlier mutation has rendered it resistant. (2) Mutations are selected to enter the mutation table by a consensus process among experts that cannot claim to be objective and reproducible. Problem 1 has been countered by the introduction of rule-based expert systems that can implement complex resistance rules involving several mutations .

First, we need a notion of success and failure, respectively, of a combination drug therapy that incurs more than a moments observation of the patient. One way is to assess the effectiveness of a therapy after some time since onset, say eight weeks. The second is a model of viral evolution under drug therapy. We have developed a statistical model that represents the paths of the virus to resistance by a set of trees ( (Beerenwinkel et al. 2005b ), see Fig. 7 ) Fig. 7 Tree model of the evolutionary development of viral resistance against the NRTI zidovudine. The model consists of two trees. Tree (a) displays two clinically observed nontrivial paths to resistance, indicated by mutations that accumulate from the wild type from left to right. Tree (b) represents unstructured noise in the data. The method also return quantitative estimates for how much of the data is explained by what tree. In this case the left tree explains about 78% of the data Given such a tree model, we can derive a quantitative value for the probability of a virus to become resistant against a certain drug after a given amount of time, given a specific combination drug therapy. This value is called the genetic barrier to drug resistance (Beerenwinkel et al. 2005a ). Finally we use multivariate statistical learning At the top, the user can preselect, here, by excluding the use of the protease inhibitor NFV. In the middle a list of ranked therapies is given. The two top-ranking therapies involve two protease inhibitors, which is not surprising since, by inspection of Fig. 2 the viral variant displays few resistances against protease inhibitors. The distribution of therapy effectiveness with (red) and without (black) preselection is displayed at the bottom techniques to generate models that classify the therapies into successes and failures based on input comprising the viral variant, the applied therapy, phenotypic resistance prediction (Problem 2), and the predicted genetic barrier to resistance. The results of the implementation of this method called THEO are displayed as illustrated in Fig. 8 .",

The clinical picture manifests that, almost exclusively, CCR5 is required for primary infection (R5 virus). As the disease progresses, the virus often switches to using CXCR4 (X4 virus). Some viral variants can use both coreceptors (R5X4 virus). The use of CXCR4 is often associated with enhanced disease symptoms and accelerated disease progression. Thus, preventing the virus from evolving to an X4 variant is a therapy goal. CCR5 seems to be inessential, as humans with an ineffective CCR5 gene shows no disease phenotype, but are highly resistant to developing AIDS. Thus CCR5 is an attractive target for inhibiting drugs. The first CCR5 blocker Maraviroc (Pfizer) has just entered the marketplace. Regulatory agencies, as they were admitting the drug for clinical use, prescribed accompanying tests of the virus for coreceptor usage, as it is ineffective to treat X4 viruses with CCR5 blockers.",

And the support of the selection of new antiviral therapies in the face of emerging resistant strains inside a patient is still mainly based on statistical analysis of previously applied therapies (to many different patients) rather than on a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interaction networks manifesting the disease. In all fields we would greatly benefit from dynamic simulatable models of the molecular processes manifesting the disease and of the way in which molecular determinants of the virus, the immune system of the host and the applied drugs influence them.
