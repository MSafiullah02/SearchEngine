Respiratory disease alone is responsible for 28% of deaths in beef calves before weaning (USDA, 2011), and 16% of feedlot cattle show signs of respiratory disease (USDA, 2013). Respiratory disease increases medication costs, reduces rates of gain, and negatively affects quality grades at harvest (Gardner et al., 1999), although segregating and feeding treated cattle a greater amount of time mitigated some of these negative consequences (Holland et al., 2010). Duff and Galyean (2007) reviewed factors both pre- and post-weaning that affect occurrence rates and outcomes of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and included the status of micronutrients as factors contributing to BRD incidence.",

            "text": "Nutrition has long been recognized as important for maintaining health. Dietary energy, protein, mineral, and vitamin concentrations have profound effects on immune function (Beisel, 1996; Calder, 2013). Specifically, mineral and vitamin deficiencies or excesses alter various components of the immune system (Wintergerst et al., 2007; McClure, 2008). Dietary requirements for minerals and vitamins for optimizing immune function may be greater than those needed for maximal growth or reproductive performance. This is complicated by variability in the ability of cattle to retain and mobilize different micronutrients. The authors suspect that subclinical deficiencies are more widespread than clinical deficiencies and probably result in greater economic losses. Nutritional intervention cannot prevent all disease but may lessen the severity of morbidity, and incidences of mortality. Other reviews on the roles of micronutrients in immune function in ruminants include those by Galyean et al. (1999), Spears (2000), and Spears and Weiss (2014). This manuscript further reviews how optimizing micronutrient nutrition improves immune function and health.",

For descriptive purposes, it can be divided into 2 branches, innate and adaptive (acquired) immunity. Both are important in mounting an efficient immune response. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against foreign pathogens, it includes the physical barriers such as the skin, and chemicals such as mucous and lysozyme. Immune cells of the innate system initiate the inflammatory response and process and present foreign particles (antigens) to the adaptive immune system. The primary cell types of innate immunity are the myeloid cells (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and macrophages. Laboratory methods of assessing innate immunity include determining differential cell numbers and measuring the chemotactic and phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages.",

These lymphocytes have matured in the thymus, and then reside in the lymph nodes and other lymphoid areas. Different subclasses of T lymphocytes provide the primary defense against viral infection (T cytotoxic cells), or produce cytokines (T helper cells) that enhance antibody responses, regulate the level of the immune response, or stimulate macrophages. Measures of the cellular immune response include in vitro assays of cell proliferation in response to a mitogen, such as phytohemmaglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A, and measures of cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. An analysis of cell populations can be conducted through flow cytometry. Another assessment, an intradermal injection of PHA coupled with measurements of skin-fold thickness has been conducted in experiments with ruminants. This in vivo test elicits a reaction with many features of a delayed hypersensitivity response and is thought to correlate with the animal's ability to mount a cell mediated response (Tizard, 2000).",

Data generated in ruminants using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches are thus far limited, but this is an area of increasing research.

Probably the most researched trace mineral, Zn plays a major role in disease resistance and immune responsiveness of humans (Prasad, 2000; Salgueiro et al., 2000) and laboratory animals (Gershwin et al., 1985). Research with laboratory animals indicates that Zn deficiency can impair thymus activity, lymphocyte function (particularly type 1 helper T cells important in the cell mediated immune response), natural killer cell function, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, neutrophil function (decreased chemotaxis and oxidative burst; Rink and Gabriel, 2000), and cytokine production (reduced IL-2).",

Zinc influences the activity of thymulin, a hormone that affects the development of lymphocytes in the thymus. Zinc is required to maintain enzymatic activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase and, therefore, nitric oxide production (Mocchegiani et al., 2000). Nitric oxide is important in macrophages for killing bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (Abbas et al., 2015). A Zn transporter, solute-linked carrier 39A8, also known as ZIP8, is potentially a link between regulation of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activity during innate immune activation and Zn metabolism (Liu et al., 2013). A transcription factor, NF-kB, is essential for cytokine synthesis.",

In a Zn deficient animal, Zn supplementation increases the rate of epithelial tissue repair and maintains cellular integrity. Evidence for the importance of Zn in ruminants includes the effects of lethal trait A46. This is a rare genetic disorder that has been found in dairy cattle that results in reduced capacity of the intestine to absorb Zn. Calves homozygous for this trait become Zn deficient after birth and will die within 5 mo of age unless aggressively supplemented with Zn. These calves possess normal numbers of functional lymphocyte subpopulations at birth, but the activity of these lymphocytes is altered as the calves become Zn deficient (Perryman et al., 1989).

Brazle (1992) reported that Zn methionine decreased the incidence of foot rot by 55% in grazing calves (2.4 vs. 5.4%). In addition, calves supplemented with Zn methionine gained more weight during the grazing period. Moore et al. (1988) reported that hoof growth and wear were similar in dairy cows fed a control and supplemental Zn (as Zn-methionine) diet during a 1-yr study; however, they observed improved hoof scores for texture, heel cracks, and interdigital dermatitis in Zn methionine-supplemented cows. In a summary of 12 trials, lactating dairy cows supplemented with Zn (180 to 400 mg/d) as Zn-methionine had lower somatic cell counts (196 vs. 294 \u00d7 103 cells/mL; Kellogg et al., 2004). These changes in the incidence of footrot and the level of somatic cell counts may reflect the importance of Zn in maintaining effective epithelial barriers at these sites. Zinc is required for the incorporation of cysteine into keratin (Hsu and Anthony, 1971). The keratin lining of the teat canal protects the teat from bacterial invasion (Nickerson, 1985). Keratin is lost during the milking process and must be regenerated to maintain this protective barrier (Capuco et al., 1992).",

These neutrophils had decreased activity of the Cu metalloenzyme, superoxide dismutase. Ceruloplasmin and superoxide dismutase, Cu-containing enzymes, have anti-inflammatory activity. Superoxide dismutase prevents oxidative tissue damage from superoxide radicals. Impaired microbicidal activity may also be a direct result of decreased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide radicals produced by superoxide dismutase-mediated reduction of superoxide radicals. Hydrogen peroxide radicals are utilized by the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system for the formation of powerful oxidizing agents, such as hypochlorous acid, and for generation of hydroxyl radicals, also potent oxidizers (Stabel and Spears, 1990). Although this has not always been observed, Arthington et al. (1995) found no difference in neutrophil bactericidal activity in heifers marginally deficient (55 d on a low Cu and high Mo diet) or adequate in Cu, based on liver Cu concentrations.",

(1993) reported that prolonged exposure to Mo (10 mg/kg DM) and S (0.2%) decreased in vivo cell mediated immune function in feeder cattle as measured by an intradermal injection of PHA. However, supplementation of Cu (5 mg/kg DM as Cu sulfate or Cu lysine) to steers with adequate Cu status did not improve animal performance or affect antibody production to ovalbumin, or impact in vivo cell mediated immune response (intradermal PHA). In another study, Cu supplementation (5 mg/kg DM for 133 d) increased antibody titers to ovalbumin (Ward and Spears, 1999). In addition, when transportation stress was applied, stressed calves supplemented with Cu had increased humoral response to pig red blood cells and increased delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to dinitrochlorobenzene; however, Cu depressed these responses in unstressed cattle (Ward and Spears, 1999). Supplemental Mo (5 mg/kg DM) did not affect any immune response measurement in calves, even though plasma Cu and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase were decreased (Ward and Spears, 1999). Antibody responses tended to be enhanced by Cu supplementation (either 10 or 20 mg supplemental Cu/kg DM to a control diet containing 7 mg/kg DM) in growing Angus steers; however, the response varied by the antigen administered (Dorton et al., 2003). Results with ruminants indicate little effect of Cu deficiency on specific immune function. While their specific immune function tests were not different (antibody production to pig red blood cells and in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis), 33% of the calves fed the high Mo diet died or were removed from the study due to disease, versus no calves fed control, high iron, or supplemental Cu, indicating the importance of Cu to the entire immune system (Ward et al., 1997).",

The difference may be due to the nature of the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infection versus E. coli infection. E. coli grows quickly, eliciting a large neutrophil influx into the mammary gland, which is enhanced by Se. Staphylococcus aureus grows more slowly and does not elicit an acute inflammatory response, and there was no benefit from Se. This highlights the complexity of the immune response and how different pathogens try to evade it.

These pigs exhibited fewer of the negative metabolic effects associated with endotoxin challenge, and these results support the hypothesis that Cr is immunomodulatory. Bernhard et al.

Gill et al.

Rivera et al. (2002) observed an increased humoral immune response in calves supplemented with vitamin E. In contrast, Rivera et al. (2003) reported that receiving calves fed supplemental vitamin E (570 IU E/d for 5-d) were treated more often for respiratory disease than calves drenched or injected with vitamin E (2,850 IU) on feedlot arrival. In another trial, Rivera et al. (2003) observed an increased febrile response during an IBRV challenge in calves supplemented with the greatest concentration of vitamin E (1,140 IU/d). Carter et al. (2005) found decreased medical costs when supplemental vitamin E (2,000 IU/d from d 1 to 28 after feedlot arrival) was used. In summary, doses > 400 IU/d seem beneficial for decreasing BRD morbidity and possibly increasing ADG (Duff and Galyean, 2007). In contrast, Cusack et al. (2009) conducted a meta-analysis using 35 published experiments and concluded there was no benefit on morbidity by feeding or administering vitamin E as an injection above the NRC (1996) recommendation.",

Beta-carotene generally has a stimulatory activity on bovine lymphocyte blastogenesis and enhances the killing ability of bovine blood neutrophils in the peripartum period (Chew, 1996). Dairy cows supplemented with 300 or 600 mg \u03b2-carotene 4 wk before calving had enhanced in vitro intracellular killing of bacteria by blood neutrophils, as well as a reduced incidence of retained placenta and metritis than control cows (Michal et al., 1994). A typical ruminant diet contains many different carotenoids that have not been studied as to their effect on immune function, including lutein and lycopene (Chew, 1993).",

Cattle monocytes produced the active form of the vitamin (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) in response to bacterial challenge through toll-like receptor signaling (Nelson et al., 2010), and this locally-produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 upregulated genes involved in the innate immune system (Nelson et al., 2010; Merriman et al., 2015). Newly-published research (Nelson et al., in press) challenges assumptions that beef cattle are generally adequate in vitamin D because of exposure to sunlight and concentrations in forages; these researchers found that whereas all cows had adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, most newborn calves (spring-born) had low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.

These mixed responses are derived from interactions between nutrients in typical ruminant diets, differences in bioavailability of micronutrients (both in the basal diet and from supplemental sources), unknown micronutrient status of test animals (hence variations in body stores), variations in pathogens, and genetic variation in cattle. More is not always better; Berrett et al. (2015) reported improved G:F in cattle fed no supplemental trace minerals throughout the feedlot phase. This negative control diet contained 58 mg Zn, 7 mg Cu, and 26 mg Mn/kg DM, and was compared with diets supplemented with an additional 30 mg Zn, 10 mg Cu, 20 mg Mn/kg DM, or with 100 mg Zn, 20 mg Cu, and 50 mg Mn/kg DM from varying sources. More basic research that increases the ability to quantify micronutrient status and that effect on response to supplementation is needed. More information is needed on the contribution of basal feeds to micronutrient status, as well as information on the bioavailability of supplemental micronutrients.",
