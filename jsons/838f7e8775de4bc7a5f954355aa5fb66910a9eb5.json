            "text": "Certain respiratory tract infections are transmitted through air. Coughing and sneezing by an infected person can emit pathogen-containing particles with diameters less than 10 \u00b5m that can reach the alveolar region. Based on our analysis of the sparse literature on respiratory aerosols, we estimated that emitted particles quickly decrease in diameter due to water loss to one-half the initial values, and that in one cough the volume in particles with initial diameters less than 20 \u00b5m is 6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mL. The pathogen emission rate from a source case depends on the frequency of expiratory events, the respirable particle volume, and the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid. Viable airborne pathogens are removed by exhaust ventilation, particle settling, die-off, and air disinfection methods; each removal mechanism can be assigned a first-order rate constant. The pathogen concentration in well-mixed room air depends on the emission rate, the size distribution of respirable particles carrying pathogens, and the removal rate constants. The particle settling rate and the alveolar deposition fraction depend on particle size. Given these inputs plus a susceptible person's breathing rate and exposure duration to room air, an expected alveolar dose \u00b5 is estimated. If the infectious dose is one organism, as appears to be true for tuberculosis, infection risk is estimated by the expression: R = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u00b5). Using published tuberculosis data concerning cough frequency, bacilli concentration in respiratory fluid, and die-off rate, we illustrate the model via a plausible scenario for a person visiting the room of a pulmonary tuberculosis case. We suggest that patients termed \"superspreaders\" or \"dangerous disseminators\" are those infrequently encountered persons with high values of cough and/or sneeze frequency, elevated pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid, and/or increased respirable aerosol volume per expiratory event such that their pathogen emission rate is much higher than average.",

Because a great majority of emitted pathogens are in large particles termed \"droplets,\" which rapidly settle out of air, some believe there is a negligible chance of inhaling any pathogens, especially if the exposure is brief. Rather, it is argued that prolonged exposure in close proximity to the infectious case is required to elevate infection risk to an appreciable degree. For some pathogens it is thought that airborne transmission requires the infectious case to directly spray droplets by coughing or sneezing onto conjunctiva or mucous membranes, (1) an inoculation route termed \"droplet transmission.\" There is no consensus on the size criterion of a droplet, but one might consider a particle with an aerodynamic diameter d a on the order of a few tens of \u00b5m or larger to be a droplet.",

Particles with d a > 10 \u00b5m generally do not reach the alveolar region, and those in the 2 \u00b5m to 10 \u00b5m range reach the alveolar region with variable efficiency. (5) Indeed, the idea of droplet nuclei involvement in airborne infection assumes that the alveolar region is the target site. (1) Because the density of a respiratory particle should be close to that of water, we will make no distinction between the physical and aerodynamic diameter. We note evidence that M. tuberculosis bacilli when carried on particles with d a = 2 \u00b5m are one to two orders of magnitude more infective than when carried on particles with d a \u2248 12 \u00b5m. (6) More extreme is the case of Streptococcus Group C bacteria, which show an inhalation LD50 in mice of 200 when carried on particles with d a = 2 \u00b5m, compared with an inhalation LD50 of 20 \u00d7 10 6 when carried on particles with d a = 12 \u00b5m. (7) Still, it is invalid to broadly assert that respirable particles are required to transmit infection via inhalation, because for some pathogens the upper respiratory tract may be a target tissue. For example, there is evidence that subsequent to inhalation exposure to variola virus (smallpox) and Yersinia pestis bacilli (pneumonic plague), primary infection can occur in either the alveolar region or the upper respiratory tract. (8\u221211) Predicting infection risk for a susceptible person involves considering a set of factors including the airborne concentration of pathogens carried on particles with d a \u2264 10 \u00b5m. This concentration depends on the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid, the numbers and initial sizes of respiratory fluid particles emitted per unit time, the rate of particle removal from room air by mechanisms that include deposition onto surfaces and exhaust ventilation, the viability loss rate of the airborne pathogen, and distance from the point of emission. The concentration also depends on the size of the pathogen and its degree of aggregation. For example, if some fraction of organisms is associated with approximately spherical clusters of diameter 20 \u00b5m, these clusters cannot be carried by particles with d a \u2264 10 \u00b5m; in this case, the pathogen concentration (number per mL) in respiratory particles with d a \u2264 10 \u00b5m will be less than the pathogen concentration in the original respiratory fluid.",

The CRH is always less than the DRH. Seinfeld and Pandis (14) reported CRH and DRH values of 40% and 80%, respectively, for ammonium sulfate. They did not report a CRH for NaCl, but given the similarity of the DRH values, it seems reasonable to expect that the CRH for NaCl is in the vicinity of, and perhaps somewhat less than, 40%. The result is that for indoor RH values >40%, we expect some water to remain in the respiratory particles at equilibrium, even if they were to behave as salt droplets. At indoor RH values far below 40%, complete drying is feasible.",

Given uncertainty in the estimate, we use the approximation d eq = 0.5\u00d7d 0 for our subsequent discussion.

These time scales vary from many seconds to a few hours for typical indoor settings. If the evaporation rate is much faster than each of the other processes, then the details of the rate need not be considered and one can reasonably treat the new equilibrium as being attained instantaneously.

The reduction accounted for the spreading of the aqueous particles when they impacted on the slide; it was assumed that these particles had lost negligible water prior to impaction. Because only 1% of the particles on the slides had airborne diameters <10 \u00b5m, it was assumed that most smaller particles were carried past the slide in the deflected air stream. To collect the latter particles, the cough or sneeze was directed into a chamber from which air was collected through a slit sampler onto an oil-coated slide. Air sampling was conducted for one minute, starting at half a minute after the expulsion event. The stained particles on the slide were measured by microscopy and appeared roughly spherical (not flattened).

The absence of large particles from the data reported by Papineni and Rosenthal signifies that the potential pathogen emission rate would be several orders of magnitude lower than suggested by the other two data sets. The deficit of large particles in the Papineni and Rosenthal study may be a result of limitations in quantitatively sampling these particles using OPCs.

An alternative explanation is that coughing emits far fewer particles (and pathogens) than does sneezing, and that the study design was not sufficiently sensitive to quantify the numbers of pathogens in large versus small particles emitted by coughing. According to Duguid, a sneeze releases 200-fold more particles than does a cough, such that three sneezes emit fiftyfold more particles than do 12 coughs. Most sneeze subjects also had higher concentrations of streptococci in saliva than did cough subjects; the respective median values were 4.3 \u00d7 10 5 mL \u22121 versus 1.6 \u00d7 10 5 mL \u22121 . Given that the number of streptococci colonies assayed on settling plates exceeded 35 for only two sneeze subjects, an approximate 100-fold reduction in the number of bacteria expelled by cough subjects indicates that no settled streptococci would be expected to be found for the latter subjects.",

To estimate this quantity for a cough, we use the L&R data (Table III) and not the Duguid data (Table II) for several reasons. First, Duguid increased the observed diameters of the smaller particles by fourfold to account for evaporative water loss, whereas we have argued that a twofold increase is more appropriate, or d 0 = 2 \u00d7 d eq . Second, owing to the lack of detail provided in Duguid's paper, we cannot discern what percentage of the particles in each of the first five diameter ranges in Table II were inappropriately size-adjusted by this factor of four. In contrast, the only adjustment applied by Louden and Roberts involved correcting for the slight spreading of the larger particles when impacting onto the bond paper; they did not adjust for evaporative water loss. Third, Duguid's data involved an unspecified number of subjects and an unspecified number of coughs in the range 10 to 22, whereas the L&R data involved observations known to be from three subjects and 90 coughs. Finally, another study in which cough particles were photographically enumerated reported that a cough releases on the order of several hundred particles.

First, the investigators stated that all particles with stain diameters greater than 10 \u00b5m were found on the bond paper covering the chamber surfaces, while all particles with stain diameters less than 10 \u00b5m were collected on the Millipore filter air samples. However, air sampling was commenced 30 min after a subject coughed into the chamber, and in that 30-min interval a large fraction of particles with d eq < 10 \u00b5m should have deposited onto the bond paper. For example, a particle with a 5 \u00b5m equilibrium diameter has a terminal settling velocity of 2.8 m h \u22121 . Given that the chamber height was 0.3 m, we would expect nearly all 5 \u00b5m particles to have settled onto the bond paper prior to the air sampling. The assay method was apparently not a factor since the same light microscopy technique with a resolving power of 0.5 \u00b5m was used to examine the bond paper and Millipore filters. We cannot resolve the discrepancy, which leaves open the possibility that the L&R cough data underestimate the number of particles with initial diameters less than 20 \u00b5m, and thereby lead to underestimating the value of V 20 .",

If an upper particle size limit were assumed, one could apply a bounded distribution such as a beta distribution or a mixture of beta distributions to model the count distribution of particle diameters. For small particles below the detection limit, if there was independent information on the volume of aerosol emitted in a cough, one might apply constrained maximum likelihood or Bayesian techniques to extrapolate the estimated diameter count distribution to these small particle sizes. In general, the particular question of interest should dictate the class of statistical model that is used. If the interest is infection via inhalation, only particles with equilibrium diameters less than 100 \u00b5m are relevant, and thus the appropriate models should give optimal estimates of the distribution in that range, for example, distributions with natural boundaries such as beta distributions or other truncated distributions. If extrapolation beyond the data is of primary interest, a different class of models is warranted.

Although mixing requires finite time, the WMR model reasonably estimates exposure intensity for persons not near the emission source, and the widely used Wells-Riley model for M. tuberculosis infection assumes the WMR construct. (6, 22) We note that if infection by large nonrespirable particles (e.g., d eq = 50 \u00b5m) were considered, relying on the WMR dispersion model would be inappropriate. The reason is that large particles have a terminal settling velocity sufficiently high to cause most to settle out of room air close to the release point; because large particles do not disperse throughout room air, exposure intensity to pathogens carried on large particles (and hence, infection risk) is extremely sensitive to a person's location in the room relative to the emission source.",

Viable pathogens can be removed from room air by several mechanisms. First, particles (and pathogens) are removed by dilution air with first-order rate constant \u03b1 1 equal to the room supply/exhaust airflow rate Q (m 3 h \u22121 ) divided by the room volume V (m 3 ), or \u03b1 1 = Q/V (h \u22121 ); the rate constant \u03b1 1 is also termed the number of air changes per hour (ach).

Although Wells and Riley inappropriately generalized the equation to the circumstance in which the infectious dose is greater than one, (23) Equation 11 is expected to apply to M. tuberculosis and to variola virus (smallpox) because published data for these two pathogens support an inference that the infectious dose is one organism. (6, (24) (25) (26) (27) A discussion of the evidence is beyond the scope of this article; instead, we refer the reader to the cited references. We note that if the infectious dose is more than one organism, as appears to be the case for the pneumonic plague agent Yersinia pestis, (28) Equation 11 is not valid.

For example, among the 96 pulmonary TB patients who were studied for cough frequency, one-half coughed 3 times per hour or less, but two patients coughed more than 48 times per hour. (29) In the previous scenario, a five-fold increase in C F to 2.5 \u00d7 10 7 mL \u22121 , a five-fold increase in cough frequency E to 50 h \u22121 , and a five-fold increase in V 20 to 3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mL, would yield G = 370 h \u22121 , C AV = 5 m \u22123 , and \u00b5 = 1. Infection risk via airborne transmission would then increase to 63% with just 1 h of exposure.",

The corresponding volume for a sneeze is 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mL. We stress that these are rough estimates, and confirming their validity would require new experimental research efforts. Given these numbers however, if information is available on the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid and the rate of expiratory events, an average emission rate for pathogens carried on respirable particles can be estimated. With further information on the room air supply rate and resistance of aerosolized pathogen to environmental stress, a simple well-mixed room model may be used to estimate the respirable pathogen concentration in general room air. In turn, infection risk for a susceptible room occupant is a function of the expected pulmonary dose, which depends on the airborne concentration, breathing rate, exposure duration, the alveolar particle deposition fraction for different particles sizes, and the infectious dose.",
