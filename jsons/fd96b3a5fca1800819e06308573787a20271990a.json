However, for acute stroke patients who have a diagnosis of or are under investigation for COVID-19, the concern for nosocomial transmission moderates operational procedures for acute stroke care. We present our experience with an in-hospital stroke code called on a COVID-19-positive patient with a left middle cerebral artery syndrome and the challenges faced for timely examination, imaging, and decision to intervene. The outlook for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of protocols to sustain timely and effective acute stroke care while mitigating healthcare-associated transmission.",

In this report, we share unique challenges in treating a COVID-19-positive patient with acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. We also discuss the current evidence and recommendations to decrease healthcare-associated transmission in acute clinical examination, imaging, and interventional procedures in acute stroke patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Since the patient presented with a large vessel occlusion stroke syndrome within an extended time window, advanced multimodal imaging was indicated to measure infarct volume as well as salvageable tissue. According to the institutional policy for acute stroke codes, as well as the patient's renal failure prohibiting the use of iodine contrast for CT perfusion studies, he was transported to MRI. The institutional protocol for transferring patients in aerosol isolation was applied by having the patient wear a surgical face mask. Laboratory results were notable for renal failure, normal platelet count, and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) >85.5 while on heparin.",

In a situation of extreme facility shortages, triaging COVID-19-positive patients with acute stroke based on severity and extent of their premorbidities is a grim but unavoidable necessity. In acute stroke patients presenting with symptoms of large vessel occlusion in an extended time window, and therefore requiring advanced imaging, CT perfusion has been shown to be equally capable of selecting patients for endovascular thrombectomy when compared with MRI (7). The time required for disinfection protocols to be conducted may require judicious use of MRI for acute stroke patients.
