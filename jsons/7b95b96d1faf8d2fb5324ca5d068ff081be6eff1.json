Based on this experiment, in the subsequent combination experiments telbivudine was used at 10 mmol/L (2.42 mg/mL), which corresponds to the maximum concentration levels observed in clinical studies (see Supplementary Materials and Methods section). To test the antiviral activity of ALV in combination with telbivudine, HepG2215 cells were treated for 72 hours with the following: ALV 0.25 mg/mL/telbivudine 10 mmol/L, ALV 1 mg/mL/telbivudine 10 mmol/L, ALV 5 mg/mL/telbivudine 10 mmol/L, and ALV 20 mg/mL/telbivudine 10 mmol/L.",

Characteristic of HBV infection are the spheric and filamentous subviral particles composed exclusively of viral envelope proteins and host-derived lipids, which are produced 10 3 -to 10 6 -fold in excess to full virions and secreted from hepatocytes. 23 By using 3 different in vitro HBV models: stably transfected (HepG2215), transiently transfected (HuH-7) , and HBVinfected (HepaRG) cells, the present study shows that ",

Blocking cyclophilins' enzymatic activity with small molecules, alisporivir or NIM811, or the selective silencing of individual cyclophilins with siRNA, markedly reduced HBV-DNA replication, as well as HBsAg production and secretion from cells. CYPA is one of the most abundant cytosolic proteins (approximately 0.1% of cell proteins) 2 and the present study shows the major utilization of cyclophilin A both in HBV replication and in HBV envelope protein secretion from hepatocytes. The experiments using HuH-7 cells with stable CYPA KD, and the findings that ALV enhanced HBV DNA and HBsAg reduction in CYPC and CYPD-silenced cells show that CYPA is important for the formation of intracellular, nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA and viral secretion, as well as for HBsAg secretion from cells. The quantitation of intracellular CYPA showed a greater amount in HuH-7 than in HepG2215 cells, which is the likely explanation for the much greater effect of alisporivir on HBsAg secretion from HuH-7 compared with HepG2215 cells. Importantly, cyclophilin inhibitors, such as alisporivir and NIM811, block all cellular cyclophilins and in HepG2215 cells there was a dose-dependent reduction in HBV DNA. The data thus suggest that, in this model, the antiviral effect was primarily a result of alisporivir and NIM811 targeting other cyclophilins (eg, CYPD and/or CYPC), leading to the observed HBV-DNA reduction in these cells.",

            "text": "The results from the present study together with previously published data indicate that the mechanisms by which alisporivir and NIM811 impact HBV replication and HBsAg production are likely to involve interference at multiple sites of the HBV life cycle. First, the finding that cyclophilin inhibition reduces intracellular nucleocapsidassociated HBV DNA in the cytoplasm suggests an antiviral effect on the production of new virions and a reduction in the recirculation of HBV nucleocapsids from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which is a key mechanism to replenish the viral template. We found a marked reduction of intracellular HBV DNA in cells with stable CYPA KD, along with intracellular HBsAg accumulation. Previous studies have shown the intracellular interaction between CYPA and HBsAg and their close association during secretion from liver cells. 24 Thus, cyclophilin inhibitors will disrupt the CYPA/HBsAg complex and reduce envelope protein secretion. Second, Hepatitis B x Antigen (HBxAg), which is essential for HBV replication, associates with the outer membrane of mitochondria, and by regulating cytosolic calcium and signaling it drives HBV replication. [25] [26] [27] NIM811 was shown to block cytosolic calcium signaling and the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a result of its inhibition of CYPD. 28 Therefore, blocking CYPD interferes with HBxAg regulation of calcium and will impact HBV replication negatively. Third, CYPA is an important co-factor for lipids and apolipoprotein B (apoB) trafficking and NIM811 was shown to decrease apoB secretion, as well as the egress of HCV particles from JFH1-HCV-infected cells. 13 Because cellular lipids are part of the HBV envelope proteins, the impact of cyclophilin inhibition on apoB secretion is likely to interfere with the intracellular formation and secretion of lipoproteins part of HBV viral and subviral particles. Fourth, recent findings have shown that the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, a membrane bile acid transporter expressed in the liver, is a functional receptor for HBV and hepatitis Delta virus, via pre-S1 binding. 29, 30 Moreover, cyclosporin A and nonimmunosuppressive analogues, such as alisporivir, recently were shown to inhibit HBV entry into cells by blocking the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, which is a cyclophilin-independent mechanism. 31, 32 The ultimate treatment goal of patients with chronic hepatitis B is to prevent the development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBsAg is the hallmark of HBV infection and HBsAg loss, with or without seroconversion to antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, is the ideal treatment end point, is associated with improved longterm outcome, [33] [34] [35] shows markedly enhanced antiviral Tcell reactivity, 36 and it allows therapy to be stopped with a minimal risk of relapse. Although the nucleos(t)ide polymerase antivirals are potent inhibitors of HBV replication and result in a profound reduction of circulating HBV, they have little effect on HBsAg transcription/subviral particle production. HBsAg loss has been reported to occur in 2%-8% of HBeAg-positive patients and in 0%-5% of HBeAgnegative patients after 3-5 years of continuous treatment. 33, 37 The clinical implication of the present study is that it provides in vitro evidence supporting a new therapeutic approach in chronic hepatitis B with a combination of a direct antiviral agent (such as the HBV-DNA polymerase inhibitors) with a host-targeting antiviral (such as alisporivir), which is likely to increase the rate of HBsAg clearance. Alisporivir is a host-targeting antiviral agent currently in development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Analyses of the clinical database, involving more than 2000 patients, show that alisporivir is well tolerated and has a markedly better safety profile when given as interferon-free treatment than with interferon-containing treatment. 38 A combination treatment with an HBV nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitor plus alisporivir could be beneficial because of the interference at multiple sites of the HBV life cycle, especially the additional effects in reducing HBsAg production and secretion, plus blocking HBV entry into noninfected hepatocytes. In the present study, the combination of alisporivir plus telbivudine showed greater impact on HBsAg and supports the potential utility of this combination, which deserves to be tested in clinical studies.",

Cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir have shown strong anti-hepatitis C virus activity in vitro and in clinical studies. However, little is known about whether hepatocyte cyclophilins are involved in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) life cycle. We investigated the effects of 2 cyclophilin inhibitors (alisporivir and NIM811) on HBV replication and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) production in cell lines. METHODS: Liver-derived cell lines producing full-length HBV and HBsAg particles, owing to stable (HepG2215) or transient (HuH-7) transfection, or infected with HBV (HepaRG cells; Invitrogen [Carlsbad, CA]), were incubated with alisporivir or NIM811 alone, or alisporivir in combination with a direct antiviral (telbivudine). The roles of individual cyclophilins in drug response was evaluated by small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclophilin (CYP)A, CYPC, or CYPD in HepG2215 cells, or CYPA knockdown in HuH-7 cells. The kinetics of antiviral activity were assessed based on levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg and Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: In HepG2215, HuH-7, and HepaRG cells, alisporivir reduced intracellular and secreted HBV DNA, in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of CYPA, CYPC, or CYPD (reduced by 80%) significantly reduced levels of HBV DNA and secreted HBsAg. Knockdown of CYPA significantly reduced secretion of HBsAg, leading to accumulation of intracellular HBsAg; the addition of alisporivir greatly reduced levels of HBsAg in these cells. The combination of alisporivir and telbivudine had greater antiviral effects than those of telbivudine or alisporivir alone. CONCLUSIONS: Alisporivir inhibition of cyclophilins in hepatocyte cell lines reduces replication of HBV DNA and HBsAg production and secretion. These effects are potentiated in combination with direct antiviral agents that target HBV-DNA polymerase.
