In his article entitled ''The long road from basic science to clinical medicine,'' Niederau [1] wrote that -in the area of free radicals -the process of translating the exploding knowledge from basic science to clinical medicine may take longer than many scientists and physicians had hoped. This might also apply to many other domains. One aspect at least is very different now: It used to be that new findings were often published only after a long delay due to the time-consuming review and printing processes. Today, Internet, e-mail and electronic publishing have considerably changed the scene. Direct worldwide contact is possible and space limitations (as in printed journals) are no longer an important issue.",

For a long time, surgery was dominated by outstanding personalities and their doctrines. More recently, not only has surgical technique been revolutionized by many innovations, but also the role of the surgeon has changed, with much more involvement in a ''symbiosis'' with internal medicine, interventional radiology and many other specialties -liver surgery is a good example with recent developments in the management of hepatic metastases [2] or liver abscesses [3] . Interdisciplinary meetings and tumour boards should enhance rapid integration of research findings from all fields into clinical decision-making. In a recent study on the techniques of hernia surgery in different hospitals, however, we found that the strate-gies used not only varied greatly but also were often ''eminence-based'' rather than ''evidence-based'' [4] .",

The innate immune response serves as a first line of immune defense against cancer. The main population of innate immune cells infiltrating tumors is cells of myeloid origin such as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. In most cases, myeloid subpopulations support an immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting tumor microenvironment. Thus, high numbers of myeloid cells in the tumor tissue often correlate with a bad prognosis for tumor patients. Other types of innate immune cells such as Natural Killer (NK) cells that infiltrate tumors can directly lead to tumor cell destruction and are crucial for the efficient activation of the adaptive immune response exerted by T lymphocytes. Therefore, high numbers of NK cells in tumors often correlate with a good prognosis for tumor patients [1, 2] .",

            "text": "The activation of NK cells is determined by a delicate balance between signals delivered by inhibitory receptors, most of which are specific for self-MHC class I molecules and activating receptors. Ligands for activating receptors are often expressed on tumor cells but not on healthy cells. Many tumors in cancer patients lose expression of MHC class I molecules to escape from direct recognition by CD8 \u00fe T cells, and thus become more susceptible to attack by NK cells. In patients suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia who undergo bone marrow transplantation, adoptive transfer of alloreactive NK cells significantly improves patients' survival [3] . However, eradication of large solid tumors by NK cells is usually not efficient despite low expression of MHC class I molecules on many tumor cells. Indeed, our study revealed that in cervical carcinoma expression of MHC class I was low in many biopsies. In addition, ligands for activating NK cell receptors were quite frequently expressed suggesting that cervical carcinoma cells should be efficiently attacked by NK cells [4] . However, numbers of NK cells in these tumors were low and tumor infiltrating NK cells were of a non-cytolytic phenotype. Thus, the focus of our studies is to harness NK cells against tumors. We are following multiple strategies including (i) Enhancing NK cell function and numbers in tumorbearing hosts and (ii) Increasing the susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell mediated killing.",

We observed that after subcutaneous injection of RMA-S tumor cells, NK cells infiltrating the tumor tissue show a less mature phenotype as compared to blood NK cells. In addition, gene expression profiling using whole genome microarrays revealed a strikingly different transcription profile of tumor infiltrating NK cells. When compared to blood NK cells, NK cells from the tumor tissue displayed a signature of genes involved in cell inhibition. Therefore, therapies that involve the blockade of NK cell inhibitory molecules should be beneficial to reactivate NK cells against tumors. Furthermore, we observed that NK cells in tumors have downregulated the chemokine receptor CXCR3 suggesting that this receptor might have been used for migration to the tumor tissue [5] . Indeed, CXCR3-deficient NK cells were defective in their ability to accumulate in the tumors. Furthermore, CXCL10, the ligand of CXCR3, recruited high numbers of NK cells to the tumor correlating with improved survival of recipient mice.",

One of the activating receptors, NKG2D, interacts with several virus-or stress-inducible ligands, including ULBP1 and -2 [6] . Recently, it has been shown that induction of the DNA damage and=or cellular senescence pathway in tumor cells resulted in activation of NK cells through up-regulation of certain NKG2Dligands. Both pathways activate the transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53 that is mutated in 50% of cancers. Our study reveals that induction of wildtype (wt) p53, but not mutated (mut) p53, led to a pronounced up-regulation of ULBP1 and -2 expression in tumor cells resulting in enhanced NKG2D-dependent degranulation and IFN-production by NK cells. Accordingly, treatment of certain wtp53-expressing tumor cell lines with the p53-reactivating small molecular compound RITA resulted in ULBP2 mRNA and cell surface up-regulation. Thus, a combination of p53reactivating drugs, such as RITA, with adoptive transfer of NK cells might constitute an efficient novel NK cell-based immunotherapy against wtp53 expressing cancers.",

The establishment of reverse-genetics systems has allowed to use influenza virus as a gene-delivery vehicle. Since influenza virus can stand insertion of foreign proteins we engineered a replication-defective influenza A virus expressing human IL-2. In order to increase genetic stability of this virus and intensify an expression of foreign gene viral NS1 gene was truncated to the N-terminal 21 amino acids and additional reading frame was inserted by using stop-start pentamer (UAAUG). C57BL=6 mice bearing established B16.F1 melanoma tumors were treated with intratumoral injection of viruses with or without IL-2 insertion. We observed a statistically significant prolongation of treated animals' lifespan and in case of cytokine therapy the rate of tumor growth was decidedly lower compared to that in mice in control group.

First results in large animals showed less apoptosis and more integrity of the bile duct epithelium flushing the bile duct with UW compared to the non-flushed bile ducts. Influenza A virus induced-ARDS can lead to a life threatening disease. Yet the mechanisms are still not elucidated. An exacerbated immune system might play a role in pathogenesis. In order to investigate the impact of atypical expression of cytokines in virus-induced lung pathology, we expressed different cytokines (IL-2, IL-15, IL-24 and CCL20) in the context of the replication defective influenza A virus delNS1. We then evaluated the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of those viruses in syngeneic Black=6 mice following intranasal administration at high concentration of 10E6 plaque forming units. In contrast to wild type virus which leads to lethal pneumonia at 1000-fold lower concentration, the empty vector (delNS1 virus) and the virus expressing IL-24 did not show any pathology. In contrast, IL-2-and CCL20-expressing viruses showed severe pneumonia-like lung pathology during the first four days, including animal death. IL15 expression showed less severe lung pathology. Serum IgG1, IgG2a and nasal wash IgA was determined 21 days after initial immunisation. Only the mice immunized with the control and with NS1-IL-24 virus developed substantial IgG2a titers. No trend in the polarisation towards the Th1 type (IgG2a) of immune response could be determined. The nasal wash virus specific IgA titers were undetectable. Lowering the concentration abolished toxicity of replication defective cytokine expressing viruses. In a second trail mice were immunized intraperitoneally with the same viruses. No illness was observed. There was no difference in serum levels of Th1=Th2 cytokines in the different groups detectable. The data indicate that cytokines might play a role in virus-induced ARDS. Furthermore, replication defective viruses expressing cytokines induce a cytokine specific immune-pathology in selected tissues. Background. Donor T cells have pleiotropic effects in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), which include the enhancement of BM engraftment, the induction of graft-versus-leukemia effects and improved immunity, but also the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We recently found that, surprisingly, transplantation of high doses of donor T cells together with donor BM causes rejection of donor BM despite costimulationblockade. This phenomenon is NK-independent but otherwise remains poorly understood. In the present study we investigate whether the release of distinct cytokines plays a role in triggering the rejection of donor bone BM and whether neutralization of selected cytokines overcomes the detrimental effect of donor T cells.",

Bilirubin serum levels must be increased prior to reperfusion. The application of bile pigments in renal transplantation might serve as a novel strategy in the prevention of IRI. In previous work we constructed oncolytic influenza A viruses, which selectively replicate on malignant transformed cells, but spare healthy cells. Similar to other oncolytic viruses, intratumoral application of the oncolytic influenza A viruses resulted in reduced tumor growth of murine cancer but did not abolish the tumors. It now becomes evident, that the main mechanism by which oncolytic viruses reduce tumor growth is the local induction of tumor ablative immune response. In order to improve the therapeutic effect we want to construct a modified virus which promotes a better outcome for the standard therapy in cancer. The aim of this work is the expression of an additional immune enhancing cytokine, such as interleukin 24. Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 (mda7)=interleukin-24 (IL-24) is a unique member of the IL-10 gene family, which displays a broad range of antitumor properties, including induction of cancer specific apoptosis. We therefore expressed IL-24 as a chimeric gene in the background of a replication defective influenza A virus delNS1 by a new cloning strategy, using specific splice-site mutations. To show the effect of IL-24 expressing virus (delNS1-IL24) on apoptosis we performed Annexin V measurements. The tumor cells CaCo 2 and SKMel28 cells infected with delNS1-IL-24 virus showed enhanced apoptotic features as compared to empty viral vector. Enhancement of apoptosis was associated with decreased viral growth, a phenomenon, which was also observed for adenoviral vectors expressing IL-24. We conclude, that influenza A viruses expressing MDA7=IL-24 expression might be applicable as a safe oncolytic therapy for cancer and warrant further preclinical assessment in animal trials. Background. Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Cancer Report 2009 it will become number one by 2010. Development of new strategies for cancer prevention or therapy is of particular importance. Previously we could show that bile pigments (BV=BR) do have distinct effects on tumor growth, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Biliverdin reductase (BVR), a kinase with dual pH=cofactor reductase activity is known to potentially influence cell proliferation and apoptosis.",

            "text": "The effect of reverse transcriptase inhibitors on colon cancer cells One mechanism for cancer cell survival is maintenance of telomers, which are repetitive sequences found on the ends of the chromosomes. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTI) as used in HIV therapy are known to interfere with telomer maintance and are therefore discussed as anti-cancer agents. However, clinical use is hampered by the high concentrations of RTI needed to inhibit telomer elongation. Here we demonstrate that the combinatorial therapy using RTI inhibits telomer maintance at much lower concentrations of the drugs in colorectal cancer cell lines. Inhibition of telomer maintenance is associated with reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest, increased induction apoptosis and reduced tumor growth in mice. Thus we conclude that RTI should be considered as therapy for solid cancer other than virus-associated T-cell lymphoma, where RTI are part of the current standard. Cancer is associated with immunosuppression. This is thought to diminish efficiency of conventional chemotherapy and possibly also of monoclonal antibody-based therapy. Animal data indicate, that cancer-associated immunosuppression is based on prolonged or repeated stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. This leads to hyporesponsiveness of monocyte-derived macrophages, the latter appears to be a hallmark of immunosuppression related to human cancer. Two negative regulators of TLR-4 signalling are IL-1 receptor-associated kinase M and B-cell leukemia 3. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of both proteins is inhibited when the TLR-7=TLR-8 agonist CL097 is added to monocyte cultures despite costimulation with the TLR-4 agonist LPS or hyaluronic acid. Reduction of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase M and B-cell leukemia 3 was paralleled by a significantly increased cytokine induction of TNF-, IL-10, and IL-12 observed after intracellular and extracellular TLR stimulation. In ex vivo stimulated whole blood of patients who have prolonged metastatic cancer, TLR-7=TLR-8 agonists retained their ability of increased stimulation of TNF-. Preliminary experiments further indicate that the CL-079-stimulation might have an enhancing effect on ADCC. These data further support the development of TLR-agonists as adjuvant to immuno-and=or chemotherapy in man.",

Our experiences of treatment of infected wounds include chronic wounds with local infection, acute infections originating from chronic wounds as well as limb-and life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. In some patients NPWT and Instillation Technology were used as a salvage procedure following failure of multiple plastic surgical procedures. One thing was equal in all patients. Debridement and subsequent plastic surgical procedure seemed to be insufficient for infection control, or time to closure seemed to be too early. We have always been using Polyhexanid (Lavasorb + ) for instillation. Instillation time directly depended on wound size. Time of therapy lasted at least 4 days, at most 18 days. Dressing changes were per-formed every two to four days. Surgical closure was performed by direct secondary suture, skin grafting or flap surgery. In all cases infection control and complete healing were achieved, despite of incomplete debridement and leaving Prolene-Mesh + in situ in two cases.",

Endoscopic stent implantation as palliative treatment for malignant obstruction in the upper GI-tract distal of the esophagus is an effective and safe method, which leads to a rapid improvement of symptoms.

Minor traumas or neuropathic plantar ulcers can cause underlying infections involving bones or joints. Often resection of infected bone and systematic antibiotic therapy is required to provide healing or at least to avoid lower limb loss. Infection control and healing is only possible, if bone resection is sufficient and concentration of antimicrobial agents reaches adequate levels.",

Zu diesem Zweck stehen vor allem alloplastische und seit kurzen auch wieder xenogene Patchmaterialien zur Verf\u00fcgung. Die ersten Erfahrungen mit einem -xenogenen, d.h. porcinen -Patchmaterial (Permacol TM ) werden im Folgenden vorgestellt und diskutiert.Kasuistik. W\u00e4hrend der letzten 15 Monate implantierten wir bei 4 Kindern (2 Neugeborenen und zwei S\u00e4uglingen (Alter 11 bzw. 19 Monate) einen Permacol TM -Patch zur Deckung relativ gro\u00dfer, d.h. im L\u00e4ngsdurchmesser zwischen 6 und 8 cm und im Querdurchmesser zwischen 4 und 6,5 cm haltender Bauchwanddefekte. Von den 2 Neugeborenen hatte ein Kind eine sog. Giant Omphalocele und das andere eine Gastroschisis. Von den beiden S\u00e4uglingen hatte ein Kind, das mit einer Gastroschisis geboren worden war, einen Zustand nach h\u00e4utiger Defektdeckung wegen einer protrahierten Wundheilungsst\u00f6rung nach Implantation eines alloplastischen Patch (Neuro-Patch + ); das zweite Kind, bei dem der durch eine Omphalozele bedingte Bauchwanddefekt linear verschlossen worden war, hatte eine halbgrapefruitgro\u00dfe Narbenhernie. Bei den beiden S\u00e4uglingen wurde initial jeweils eine Schusterplastik angelegt und nach deren Ausbau der Bauchwanddefekt wegen der kritischen Lokalverh\u00e4ltnisse (ausgedehnte Defekte, Hautverschluss nur unter Spannung m\u00f6glich) mit einem Permacol TM -Patch gedeckt. Bei den beiden S\u00e4uglingen waren ebenfalls die problematischen Hautverh\u00e4ltnisse, beide hatten eine deutlich \u00fcberdehnte Haut mit einer minimalen subkutanen Fettschicht, der Grund f\u00fcr die Verwendung eines Permacol TM -Patch zum Defektverschluss.Ergebnisse. Bei den beiden Neugeborenen ging die Wundheilung auf Grund umschriebener Hautnekrosen sehr protrahiert vor sich, letztlich heilten die Patches aber sehr gut ein. Bei den beiden S\u00e4uglingen ergab sich trotz der schlechten Hautverh\u00e4ltnisse keine Wundheilungsst\u00f6rung. Der bisherige postoperative Verlauf (Beobachtungszeitraum (Ende Juli 2010) zwischen 5 und 13 Monaten) gestaltete sich im Wesentlichen zufriedenstellend, wenngleich die vom Hersteller angegebene Durch-bzw. Abbaubarkeit des Patchmaterial bei keinem Kind bislang wirklich nachweisbar war. Im Gegenteil, bei den beiden S\u00e4uglingen sind die Patches unter der Bauchhaut, da leicht prominent, gut erkennbar und lassen sich als derbe ,,Platten\" tasten; bei einem dieser Kind imponiert der untere Patchrand sogar wie aufgeworfen. Sonographisch nimmt sich die Gef\u00e4\u00dfeinsprossung bei allen Kindern eher bescheiden aus.Diskussion. Kongenitale Bauchwanddefekte werden bei Neugeborenen bzw. S\u00e4uglingen seit ca. 35-40 Jahren u.a. mit Hilfe unterschiedlicher Patchmaterialien verschlossen. Initial wurden vor allem lyophilisierte Dura und ,,einfache\" Kunststoffe verwendet. Mit diesen Materialien wurden zwar recht zufrieden stellende Ergebnisse in Bezug auf ihre Einheilung und Belastbarkeit erzielt, sie wurden aber wegen verschiedener Infektions-bzw. Adh\u00e4sionsprobleme recht bald zugunsten neuer alloplastischer Materialien verlassen. Einige dieser Materialien erwiesen sich in Bezug auf Handling, Einheilung und Belastbarkeit als sehr ad\u00e4quat; da sie jedoch eine mehr oder weniger ausgepr\u00e4gte Fremdk\u00f6rperreaktion hervorrufen und ein Leben lang mit unbekannten Sp\u00e4teffekten in situ verbleiben, wurde nach neuen xenogenen Grafts gesucht. Auflagen waren ein fehlendes Infektionsrisiko, eine minimale Fremdk\u00f6rperreaktion und vor allem Durch-bzw. Abbaubarkeit der Patches. W\u00e4hrend der letzten Jahre wurden diverse solcher Materialien vorgestellt. Da bez\u00fcglich ihrer Sicherheit sehr unterschiedliche Erfahrungen publiziert wurden, entschlossen wir uns erst im letzten Jahr, ein solches Produkt, konkret Permacol TM , ein porcines Mesh, zu verwenden. Dies deshalb, da, wie aus den wenigen Literaturangaben hervorging, dieses azellul\u00e4re Mesh die eben angef\u00fchrten Auflagen zu erf\u00fcllen schien. Wir entschlossen uns deshalb, dieses Material bei ausgesuchten Patienten mit zu erwartenden schwierigen Defektverschl\u00fcssen zu benutzen -Kriterien waren relativ gro\u00dfe Bauchwanddefekte und vorgesch\u00e4digte Bauchhaut mit einer sehr d\u00fcnnen Subkutanschichte, bei denen mit einer gest\u00f6rten Wundheilung zu rechnen war. Das bisherige Ergebnis scheint uns recht zu geben, auch wenn die Durch-und Abbauprozesse noch auf sich warten lassen. Allerdings sind die Beobachtungszeitr\u00e4ume (aktuell zwischen 5 und 13 Monaten) noch relativ kurz.Schlussfolgerungen. Permacol TM ist ein neues xenogenes Patch-Material f\u00fcr spezielle Weichteilrekonstruktionen, das sich, wie unsere eigenen kurzzeitigen Erfahrungen bzw. die unserer viszeralchirurgischen Kollegen zeigen, gut handeln l\u00e4sst und auch bei schwierigen Verh\u00e4ltnissen (,,ausged\u00fcnnte\" Hautlappen, fehlendes Subkutangewebe, lokale Infektionen) ohne Gewebsverluste einheilt. Die Durch-und Abbauprozesse dauern allerdings, zumindest bei unseren Patienten, deutlich l\u00e4nger als vom Hersteller angegeben. Demzufolge ist derzeit nicht abzusch\u00e4tzen, welche Sp\u00e4tprobleme dieses Material (immunologische Prozesse, toxische Einfl\u00fcsse, kanzero-und=oder mutagene Effekte, Haltbarkeit des Narbengewebes) bedingen wird. Nicht von ungef\u00e4hr gibt es deshalb neue Entwicklungen auf dem Sektor k\u00fcnstlicher Werkstoffe, die ebenfalls durch-bzw. abbaubar sind, aber durch kein herstellungsbedingtes Infektionsrisiko sowie praktisch keine Fremdk\u00f6rperreaktion belastet und vor allem -im Gegensatz zu den bisher angebotenen Materialien -auch stabil und belastbar sein sollen.
