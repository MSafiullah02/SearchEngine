Their common pathogenetic mechanism is progressive atherosclerosis in which oxLDL (oxidized LDL) plays major role. Receptor-mediated uptake of oxLDL by the monocyte-derived macrophages activates the long-term epigenetic reprogramming of innate immunity, which is termed \"trained immunity.\" The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms and treatment possibilities that can control the activities of these specific macrophages.",

After all, they have weaker immune systems. But here is the puzzling thing: it is often not the SARS-CoV-2 per se that is so lethal, but the reaction of immune system to it. In some people, the immune system goes into overdrive and creates what is known as a \"cytokine storm\", which is often deadly. Therefore, delineating the mechanisms behind these chronic diseases may provide clues for the clinical management of the severe COVID-19.",

This innate immune memory has been termed \"trained innate immunity\" that is present in patients with atherosclerosis or associated risk factors [2] . Training with oxLDL stimulates the epigenetic reprogramming at the level of histone modifications at the promoters of TNF\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-6 (interleukin 6), IL-8, and CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36).

In SARS-CoV-infected human cases, marked production of oxidized lipids are observed in the inflammatory exudates lining the injured air spaces, pneumoctyes, as well as macrophages [4] Consequently, oxLDL-trained macrophages encounter with the huge amount of oxidized lipids in the virus-infected areas and exhibit greater oxidized lipid uptake, leading to transient lipid depletion [5] .

CARD9 is critical adaptor protein and a central integrator in innate immune cell activation that triggers the inflammatory signaling pathway in response to viral infection. CARD9 signalosome, which is a tripartite protein complex formed from CARD9, BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10), and MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) (CBM complex), leads to the activation of NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, resulting upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines [7] .",

Consequently, while SARS-CoV-infection in oxLDL-trained macrophages cannot produce protective type I interferons, they readily potentiates existing low-grade inflammation through ASC-mediated caspase-1 activation [10, 11] .
