To generate pseudotype recombinant VSV with S of SARS CoV (VSV\u0394G*SG), 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS\u2010SG, and then infected with a recombinant VSV (VSV\u0394G*G), in which the open reading frame of G was replaced with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and complemented with G in trans.\n\n5\n, \n6\n Three hundred TCID50 of SARS CoV or 300 infectious units (IU) of VSV\u0394G*\u2010SG was added to twofold diluted SARS CoV specific chicken antisera. After incubation for 1 hour, the mixtures containing 100 TCID50 of virus or 100 IU VSV\u0394G*SG were added to the rinsed Vero E6 cells in triplicate wells of 96\u2010well plates. Serum from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was included as negative controls. The cells infected with SARS CoV were monitored daily for the cytopathic effect for 5 days. Neutralizing titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that fully inhibited the virus replication in cells infected with SARS CoV or fully inhibited GFP expression in cells infected with VSV\u0394G*\u2010SG. The GFP\u2010positive cells were counted at 16 hours post infection under a fluorescence microscope.",

A polyclone serum against SARS CoV blocks the infectivity of the VSV\u0394G*SGG in Vero E6 virus, and the blocking titer is similar to the titer blocking the live SARS CoV. These results indicated that the VSV\u0394G*SG will be a safe and useful replacement of the live SARS CoV for SARS neutralization test, cell\u2010entry assay, and novel vaccine or antiviral drugs development.",
