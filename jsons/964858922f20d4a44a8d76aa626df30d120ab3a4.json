In this paper, we conduct an analytical game-theoretical study to examine the effects of supply capacity disruption timing on pricing decisions for substitute products in a two-supplier one-retailer supply chain setting. We investigate whether the timing of disruption may significantly impact the optimal pricing strategy of the retailer. We derive the optimal pricing strategy and ordering levels with both disruption timing and product substitution. By exploring both the Nash and Stackelberg games, we find that the order quantity with the disrupted supplier depends on price leadership and it tends to increase when the non-disrupted supplier is the leader. Moreover, the equilibrium market retail prices are higher under higher levels of disruption for the Nash game, compared to the Stackelberg game. We also uncover that the non-disruptive supplier can always charge the highest wholesale price if the disruption occurs before orders are received. This highlights the critical role of order timing. The insights can help operations managers to proper design risk mitigation ordering strategies and re-design the supply contracts in the presence of product substitution under supply disruptions.",

In this setting, the retailers face the common problem to adjust their pricing and ordering decisions in response to the prevailing supply uncertainty. This is particularly relevant when multiple suppliers offer competing substitute goods when the wholesale price needs to be decided. This research deals with one specific aspect of this decisionmaking environment, posing the following research question: how retailers should account for the timing of disruptions at the competing suppliers of substitutable products when making pricing and ordering decisions?",

            "text": "Our main analysis is based on three stylized facts, which we motivate in the following. First, despite the complexity of supply chains (SCs), one can distinguish a dyadic supplier-retailer structure as one of the most common ones in the analysis. There is a growing body of research that studies the impact of a supply disruption to pricing and ordering at retailers (e.g.; Tomlin 2009a, Asian and Nie 2014, Chen and * corresponding author 1 Yang 2014 , Gao et al. 2017 , Dong et al. 2018 , He et al. 2019 , Choi 2020 , Zheng et al. 2020 , specifically in supply chains for beverages, fresh produce, etc. Severe disruptions typically result in supply shortages at the retailer for the disrupted product and retailers employ demand management (such as pricing) and supply management (e.g., placing emergency orders or managing inventory) strategies to mitigate this temporary disruption (Hu et al. 2013 , Sawik 2013 , Li et al. 2017 , Freeman et al. 2018 , Shao 2018 , Hosseini et al. 2019 , L\u00fccker et al. 2019 , Sawik 2019 , Wood et al. 2019 . For instance, retailers sourcing fresh produce, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, in large quantities from multiple competing suppliers may face supply loss due to crop failures or food contamination. Recently, there was a case of supply disruption of romaine lettuce to retailers and restaurants due to contamination with Shiga-toxin producing E. coli bacteria (Skerritt 2018) . A food-safety recall was issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2018) . This recall led to an increase in the demand and prices of other lettuce produce, and the price of iceberg lettuce increased from $36 before the supply disruption to around $60 (each carton) after the disruption. In addition, several retailers and restaurants such as Panera Bread (Panera 2019) managed their lettuce supply by intermittently ordering from the suppliers which were not part of the CDC recall notice. During that time, romaine lettuce was still available for sale, however, the product sales were reduced by about 38 percent (total $7.5 million) in the week ending on November 24, 2018, as compared to the week before that. In conclusion, the supply disruption of romaine lettuce led to an increase in the price and demand of other (substitute) lettuce produce. This disruption also led to a decrease in the sales of (in-stock/ on-shelf) romaine lettuce at the retailers.",

Thus, supply shortages for food and beverage products, usually short-term, can lead to an increase in retail prices, procurement costs, and the demand for substitute products from alternate suppliers. Besides food and beverage businesses, other businesses resort to managing demand, when facing supply disruption, by offering available substitute products to their customers. For example, facing supply disruption of silicone, a material used to manufacture tires through vulcanization, a company called Ace Products and Consulting LLC used devulcanized silicone as a substitute of silicone (Brown 2019) . Their CEO, Erick Sharp, stated in 2018: \"If we can offset 10 percent of it (silicone demand) , anything helps at this point, especially when you're trying to equal the price back out.\" In this paper, we focus on competitive pricing as a demand management tool that can be used to match supply and demand for substitute products in the event of short-term supply shortages.",

            "text": "Third, we consider the information available to the players regarding the supply disruption. An important determinant in the reliable/unreliable sourcing literature is the information available about the disruption, and, more specifically, the availability of information to some players and the non-availability of this information to other players. Yang et al. (2009 Yang et al. ( , 2012 , G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f et al. (2012) , Yang and Babich (2014) , Teunter et al. (2018) , and Zhu (2015) assume a lack of visibility regarding the disruption risk of a supplier and study different scenarios of information availability/unavailability among the players. Their findings imply, for example, that optimal pricing and ordering profiles can be efficiently derived when considering competing suppliers in different scenarios of information availability/unavailability. We draw on several theoretical foundations to address the real-world challenges due to supply disruption as described above. The area of supply disruption risk mitigation and recovery is mainly shaped by problems of reliable/unreliable and primary/backup suppliers (Tomlin 2006 , Yu et al. 2009 , Yang and Babich 2014 , Hu and Kostamis 2015 , Tsai 2016 , Ivanov et al. 2017 , Li et al. 2017 , Yin and Wang 2017 , Gupta and Ivanov 2020 to name a few). Most studies consider how changes to some operational parameters (e.g., capacity disruptions) impact sourcing and customer performance. There is a strong and growing literature in the given area, with methodologies grounded in the newsboy problem extensions and game theory. Typically, a two-stage sourcing system is considered where a single product can be sourced from both unreliable (less expensive) and reliable (more expensive) suppliers (Tomlin 2006 , Chopra et al. 2007 . In this problem domain, competition, pricing, and contracting issues have been the research focus (for e.g., Babich et al. 2007 , Zhao et al. 2018 , resolving the trade-off between supply reliability vs costs. While studies have established the salience of optimal pricing and ordering policies in single product cases, including supplier portfolio diversification, little attention has been directed to substitutable products sold by competing suppliers.",

At the same time, new practical cases motivate researchers to extend existing modeling frameworks. In particular, the issues of product substitution in the case of disruption can be considered as an interesting research avenue. Even if the power imbalance with substituable products was studied in 3 literature (for e.g., Edirisinghe et al. 2011) , the inclusion of product substitution effects on the pricing and ordering decisions under supply disruption was considered only in a few recent papers (Tomlin 2009a , Lu et al. 2011 , Chakraborty et al. 2015 . Our literature analysis provides evidence that supply disruptions may lead to price fluctuations due to supply shortages. For example, the devastating shortage of flu vaccinations that occurred in the US in 2004, which was caused by bacterial pollution, led to an increase in the vaccination price from $60 to $800 (Yu et al. 2009 ). The earthquake in Japan also resulted in the increasing prices for products affected by the natural disaster (Fang and Shou 2015, Kumar et al. 2018 ). While natural disasters may cause supply interruption and the resulting price fluctuations, in other settings, the opposite effect can be observed when the price increases cause supply interruptions.",

The resulting supply shortage was partially mitigated at most retailers by sourcing the product from a competing supplier. This spurred our initial motivation to extend the existing body of knowledge with regards to product substitution issues. Such questions have arisen as pricing strategy sensitivity to disruption among competitors at one supplier, or the impact of disruption on retailer's ordering behavior and the price policy of non-disrupted suppliers who know about their competitor's disruptions has become more apparent. Should non-disrupted suppliers charge a higher (or lower) wholesale price to capitalize on the lost supply? Does a retailer always loses money because of a potential loss in supply and a potential increase in the wholesale prices? The literature is scarce in answering these significant questions, specifically, the effects of disruption timing, the sequence of ordering decisions by suppliers and bi-directional product substitution.",

None of these studies, though, have formally and rigorously quantified the optimal pricing and ordering configuration by adapting the sourcing decisions.

In contrast to these studies, we do not consider the demand switching effect, but the supply switching perspective of product substitution, bi-directionally substitutable products, and incomplete information about supply disruptions. Such a perspective appears to be more relevant in a practical decision environment, relative to inherent problems in adapting the pricing and ordering decisions on the changes in the supplier base (Chen and Yang 2014 , He et al. 2016 , Kumar et al. 2018 , Wang and Yu 2020 .",

Such a combination is unique in the literature and captures some of the complexities of sourcing decisions in practice. It considers the timing of disruptions, pricing, and sourcing decisions and product substitution, all of which as a whole may generate significantly different results as compared to previous research. We show that the associations of disruption timing and severity and price leadership with the optimal pricing and ordering configuration can be efficiently deciphered by our approach.

Their findings highlight how costs, capacity (limited or unlimited), and volume flexibility affect the optimal selection of contingency policies, such as risk mitigation inventory and capacity flexibility. Serel (2008) explores a supply chain system with one retailer, a manufacturer, and an unreliable supplier under the extended newsboy problem setting. The author shows the existence of a Nash equilibrium under the competitive pricing game setting. He also reveals that in a Stackelberg game led by the manufacturer, the retailer is expected to earn a higher profit when excess demand is backordered. Note that a similar scenario with a two-product system is studied by Tomlin and Wang (2008) . Chen et al. (2012) extend Tomlin (2006) and Chopra et al. (2007) who investigate a periodicreview inventory system with stochastic demand and limited backup supplier capacity. He et al. (2016) show that supply reliability thresholds play a critical role in buyer procurement strategy choices. Ang et al.

(2011) study a common single period system where two substitute products can be sourced from a reliable and expensive supplier or an unreliable and cheaper supplier. The products in their study are downward substitutable (i.e., only higher-grade products can substitute for lower-grade ones). The author proves that product substitution increases the expected marginal benefit of dual sourcing for the higher-grade product. Different from Lu et al. (2011) , we consider bi-directionally substitutable products. Chakraborty et al. (2015) study a system with two competing manufacturers and a common retailer. The authors formulate a newsboy problem-based model to determine the optimal price and quantity and study the non-cooperative games in the supply chain.",

(2013) Overall, this paper relates to the above-reviewed literature as it also focuses on exploring supply disruptions through an analytical approach. In fact, it can be treated as an extension of various prior studies by investigating the impacts of product substitution on supplier disruption risk mitigation in the following problem setting: 1. The system consists of one retailer and two suppliers, and the retailer aims to maximize its profits by adjusting pricing policies. Product substitution (between two products supplied by the respective suppliers) is considered whereby products are bi-directionally substitutable. Different timing in relation to the ordering decisions and disruption in the supply chain is examined. Price leadership in the supply chain is considered. 3. Supply disruptions risk can be modeled using different modeling approaches including random yield, all-or-nothing supply, and stochastic capacity. In this paper, for analytical tractability as well as fitness to our scope, we use the random yield modeling approach (Yano and Lee 1995, Dada et al. 2007 , Chen and Yang 2014) in our study, i.e., in this model, the quantity received by a buyer is a random fraction of the quantity ordered from the disrupted supplier.",

Interestingly, we note that lower prices do not always result in larger order quantities, and only the follower in the SC receives a larger order quantity as compared to the order quantity in the Nash game as outlined in Theorem 1.ii). This occurs because a price decrease or an increase by the leading supplier can be easily followed by the other supplier by a price reduction or an increment, respectively.

Finally, the retailer sets the market prices and demand is realized. When one supplier leads the other, the disruption at A can occur after the other supplier receives the order (Case 2) or before the other supplier receives the order (Case 3). In the first two scenarios, there are always two orders with B: a regular order placed before the disruption and an emergency order placed after the disruption. In Case 3, R places only a single emergency order with B at the wholesale price w E of quantity q E . In the following subsections, we analyze and discuss the three cases in detail. It is easy to see in Case 1 and Case 2 that A and B receive orders identical to the equilibrium order quantities in benchmark Cases a) and b), respectively.

However, when B leads the SC, the equilibrium emergency wholesale price is always higher than the corresponding price that will be charged in the Nash game. This result is surprising: the equilibrium wholesale prices charged by A and B are both higher than their Nash gaming counterparts in the Stackelberg games for the benchmark cases, as shown in Theorem 1.i). Therefore, intuitively the emergency wholesale prices must also be higher than the Nash game counterpart. However, this occurs only when B leads the SC. This result is driven by Theorem 1.ii) which posits that the quantity ordered to supplier A is lower when A leads the SC than when B leads the SC. Consequently, if there is a low level of disruption, then the supply R loses from A is not high, and B can charge a higher emergency wholesale price for the smaller quantity of product 2 ordered by R. However, when B leads the SC, the impact of disruption is high.

Observe from Lemma 4 that this order relationship between the wholesale prices does not hold when the supply disruption is not too serious (i.e., \u03b4 \u2208 \u03b2 1 \u03b2 2 2\u03b2 1 \u03b2 2 \u2212 1 , 1). The reason for this interesting observation can be explained using Theorem 1.ii). We know that, in the Nash game, the equilibrium order quantity q e 2,n (q e 1,n ) is lower (higher) compared to the order quantity q e 2,s A (q e 1,s A ) in the Stackelberg game. When the level of disruption is high (\u03b4 is low) and q e 1 is high, A fulfills a much smaller quantity of the original order for product 1. Consequently, R would place a larger order to B for product 2 and thus, B charges a higher emergency price in the Nash game since q e 1,n > q e 1,s A . This effect is further pronounced by the fact that the initial order q e 2,n < q e 2,s A is lower in the Nash game where both suppliers lack price leadership. Overall, the theorem provides insights into the influence of the sequence of ordering and disruption on the pricing behavior of the emergency supplier. Thus, when a retailer is working with a supplier facing disruption, it is better to order first with them only when the disruption is serious to secure a better emergency order wholesale contract price.",

Therefore, by definition this scenario precludes the case with the Nash game between A and B. We only consider the case when A leads the SC by setting the wholesale price for product 1, R ordering from A and afterwards there are two possibilities: disruption occurs immediately or occurs after R places an order with B. These two scenarios are presented as Cases 3 and 2, respectively in Figure 3 . The ordering and pricing decisions that take place after the uncertainty about the disruption is resolved are identical to the decisions in the deterministic cases presented in Section 4, and the only difference arises for the two decisions that always occur before disruption which is the wholesale price set by A and the corresponding order quantity by R. It is easy to see that the quantity delivered by A in both cases is the same, i.e., a fraction \u03b4 of the original order quantity. The objective function of retailer A does not depend on the probabilities for disruption timing and the results from Section 4 will continue to hold. This result is expected and consistent with the analysis with disruption timing.",
