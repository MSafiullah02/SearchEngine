A typical occurrence in a high-risk society, it is significant in the following ways. First, it is an external manifestation of accumulated risk, and like the world's many other extreme weather events caused by global climate change, it points to the trend that disasters have become more common. Second, it reflects the change in risk structure. It has far greater social implications than ordinary natural disasters, and is closely related to political and social processes such as urban-rural dualism and the provision of public services. Yet another event of systemic tension following the SARS outbreak in 2003, it attracted nationwide attention. Finally, its social implications were uncertain and difficult to predict based on previous experiences. last over 40 days. The travel season saw nearly two billion passengers, including migrant workers, students and other people, travel by sea, air, and land for tour and for family reunion. Apart from busy passenger transportation, freight traffic also peaked.",

Such extreme weather was a result of global environmental degradation. (3) Technology: Apart from road closure, the winter storm also caused lengthy delays in rail transportation. This is mainly because electric locomotives had replaced most diesel locomotives due to technological advances and the rail system's dependence on power grids aggravated systemic risks. (4) Socioeconomic structure: The socioeconomic structure has multi-faceted influence on risk. Chunyun, which was affected by the 2008 winter storm, is typical of China's urban-rural dualism. The failures in power grids were partly attributed to the lack of high-standard power supply equipment, an epitome of structural inadequacy of public spendings in rural areas. The commitment to \"bringing every migrant worker back home for family reunion during the Spring Festival\" is for the purpose of social integration, a wise decision given the current political, economic and social structures.",

In natural-science studies of disasters, the theory of \"disaster chain\", a chain of disastrous events where one event typically leads to the next, is widely accepted as a basic analytical tool. 1 The 2008 winter storm, however, posed a challenge to the theory. The existence of hundreds of millions of migrant workers due to China's unique household registration (hukou) system and urban-rural dualism from cities to their rural homes, the large-scale movement of people driven by the tradition of family reunion and the heavy dependence of modern rail transportation on power grids made the \"chain effect\" of the winter storm more complicated and augmented the disastrous consequences, and these could hardly be explained by natural factors and the linear path of the traditional \"disaster chain\" theory. In other words, natural disasters are more than \"natural\";they also have social attributes, including the social environment where disasters occur and actions taken for disaster relief and mitigation. Obviously, natural sciences alone cannot fully explain the social attributes of disasters.",

            "text": "In general, academics focus on explaining or analyzing problems while practitioners concentrate on solving problems. Amid the great social changes in China, social problems have increased exponentially, and practitioners' problem-solving mentality can easily cause them to seek the quickest rather than the best solutions. This will inevitably result in short-sightedness in policy formulation. As a matter of fact, research and practice cannot be completely cut off from each other. Now that research is increasingly geared to the practical needs of the country and researchers are warned against the danger of being divorced from reality, it is all-important to carry out forward-looking, systematic and strategic research within a new comprehensive analytical framework. However, 1 As early as the 1980s, Ma Zongjin founded a comprehensive disaster mitigation team, which brought together experts in earthquake, water conservancy, meteorology and agriculture. As an important part of their research output, the team introduced the concept of \"disaster chain\". Ma put forward three kinds of \"disaster chains\": \"heavy rain (typhoon)-rainstorm-disaster avoidancemudslide-flood-farmland, road and building damage-drowning deaths, etc.\"; \"earthquake-(rain and snow)-collapse-sand surge-damage to buildings (housing, factories, lifeline)-transportation disruptions-communications disruptions-gas leakage, fire, etc.\"; and \"drought-dust storm-heat wave-water shortage-damage to crops, forests and grasses-shrouded rural and urban communities\". On this basis, Shi Peijun proposed the \"disaster chain\" of cold wave: \"cold wave-snow disaster (frost, cold temperature)-biological effects of cold and frost (mechanical failure, structural damage, damage to agricultural and pastoral areas)\". The theory of \"disaster chain\" has become one of the main guidelines in the field of natural disaster reduction. See: Ma Zongjin. Some thoughts on emergency response to natural disasters in China. China Emergency Management, 2007 (2); Shi Peijun. Theory and dynamics of disaster research. Journal of Natural Disasters, 2002 (3). just as academics often criticize practitioners for lack of long-term vision in policy fragmentation, practitioners often accuse academics of rendering no immediate and practical help. A lack of cooperation between them was also shown in their response to the winter storm of 2008.",

While road closure did prevent serious traffic accidents, the closure of the expressway system, which is unprecedently important to our society today, would have a crippling effect on the entire social system-especially after the disruption of the rail network. Poor coordination also hindered emergency management. For example, the provincial government of Guangdong and the municipal government of Guangzhou were sometimes at odds with China Railway Guangzhou Group, the local arm of the National Railway Administration. They couldn't effectively coordinate their actions and operations, and foot-dragging occurred at times. After the trunk line of the Beijing-Guangzhou railway was closed due to the power grid failure in Chenzhou City of Hunan Province, the provincial government of Guangdong encouraged migrant workers to stay in Guangdong for the Spring Festival instead of returning to their hometown; the local railway authority, however, asked the Guangzhou Railway Station to continue to sell tickets of the Beijing-Guangzhou line. As a result, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers swarmed around the railway station, causing public safety concerns and disturbing the residents nearby. The fact that the provincial government of Guangdong and the municipal government of Guangzhou could not give instructions to the local railway authority and railway station was a hindrance to emergency response efforts.",

            "text": "As disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity, disaster management research has attracted more attention and made new progress. The following two consensuses have been reached. First, disasters are a result of interactions between nature and society. The Environment as Hazard, first published in 1978, for the first time extends the scope of disaster mitigation from natural hazards and protective works to human reactions to disasters, pointing out that the influence of and losses incurred by disasters can be reduced by adjusting human behavior. 3 Second, the social attributes of disasters begin to predominate over their natural attributes. As Anthony Giddens put it, \"In all traditional cultures, one could say, and in industrial society right up to the threshold of the present day, human beings worried about the risks coming from external nature-from bad harvests, floods, plagues or famines. At a certain point, however-very recently in historical terms-we started worrying less about what nature can do to us, and more about what we have done to nature. This marks the transition from the predominance of external risk to that of manufactured risk.\" 4 The above consensuses show that disaster management, as an integrated system, has two important implications. The first is comprehensive management, meaning we should manage both the natural and social attributes of disasters; the second is whole-process management, that is, managing not only the hazard-inducing social environment but also the social consequences caused by disasters. This is because the social attributes of the disaster include the hazard-inducing social environment and also disaster mitigation and relief operations. The two aspects influence each other and together determine the social consequences of the disaster.",

Of course, Western social scientists have made their efforts in this area. In Europe where formulation of theory has been a traditional strength, and the theory of risk society, which was developed by Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Scott Lash, has gained influence as an explanation of the world's disasters. In the United States, Enrico Quarantelli established the world's first Disaster Research Center (DRC) in the field of social sciences at Ohio State University in 1963. The research center has so far carried out nearly six hundred field studies and obtained a wealth of research results useful for policymaking. Although China has suffered from frequent disasters since ancient times and has practical experiences in dealing with them, theoretical research on disasters is inadequate, especially in the field of social sciences. Therefore, it is essential to construct a new analytical framework to provide intellectual support for explaining and responding to disasters.",

Because of the classification of academic disciplines, disaster research in the field of social sciences lacks a holistic approach. Representative studies fall into three different fields and span three different periods. First, beginning in the early 1990s, sociologists paid attention to social risks in China's reform and opening up. Some focused on quantitative risk analysis and prediction, and some on diagnosis and criticism of structural transformation. Second, given the challenges faced by governments around the world after the September 11 attacks in 2001, researchers in political science showed growing interests in how the Chinese government conducted crisis management against the backdrop of governance reform in the transition period. Third, after the SARS outbreak in 2003, researchers and practitioners in administrative management, driven by national needs, carried out intensive and large-scale research on the institutions, mechanism and legal framework governing government crisis management. Research in these three fields has different focal points: sociological research, on the basis of observation of social phenomena, tries to predict trends through the index system and structural diagnosis; research in the political sphere, on the basis of international comparison, pays close attention to how policy makers could benefit from international good practices and how the political consequences of disasters would propel governance reform; and research in administrative management, driven by the practical needs, emphasizes the design and operation of general rules and principles and the immediate control of disasters.

A case in point is the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. After that, disasters such as the 1979 Three Miles Island accident in the United States, the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India, and the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger explosion brought people's fear and concern from international conflicts to the everyday world. Underlying all these disasters are problematic organizational management and flawed institutional design. Researchers who uphold this tradition mostly have a research focus on management. Also optimistic about the future, they try to prevent, identify, isolate, tackle and manage disasters by strengthening organizational management and improving institutional design. 6 3. \"Politics-society\" tradition Since the 1980s, far-seeing researchers have come to realize that the greatest disaster is the self-destruction of modernity. As Ulrich Beck pointed out, in the process of modernization, the incredible productivity gains have given rise to unprecedented dangers and hazards. 7 \"The possibility of nuclear war, ecological calamity, uncontainable population explosion, the collapse of global economic exchange, and other potential global catastrophes provide an unnerving horizon of dangers for everyone\". 8 Most of the researchers upholding the tradition work in social sciences, especially sociology and politics. They believe that the root of the problem lies in modernity per se-reflexive modernity, 9 and the way out is political and social transformation. However, that is not going to be easy.

Against this backdrop, crisis was refined as a serious threat to the basic structure and core values of a social system, in which key decisions are required because of the high uncertainty and time pressure (Uriel Rosenthal et al. 1989) . 13 Later, more researchers started to explore a broader range of crisis management issues, and paid attention to the whole process of crisis and crisis management. For example, Steven Fink divided the crisis life cycle into four stages: prodromal, breakout or acute, chronic, and resolution. Norman R. Augustine identified six stages of crisis management: avoid crises, prepare to manage crises, recognize a crisis, contain the crisis, resolve the crisis, and profit from the crisis. And Robert Heath proposed the 4R model: reduction, readiness, response, and recovery.",

Frank Knight then defined it as an economic term by differentiating risk from uncertainty, and used uncertainty to explain where profit comes from and what the nature of businesses is. 14 Apart from substantive definitions of \"risk\", sociologists, psychologists and anthropologists have also developed constructive definitions of the term. According to sociologist Nicklas Lumann, what's opposite to risk is not security but danger. The distinction between the two notions is that risk depends on how people perceive it, so does the risk associated with it, while danger precedes human decision or behavior, and the loss associated with it is determined by external factors. 15 Psychologist Paul Slovic holds that risk is subjectively defined by individuals who are subject to influence by psychological, social, institutional and cultural factors. With well-designed surveys, these factors and their relationships can be measured through quantitative and modelling methods. 16 He, together with Sarah Lichtenstein and Brauch Fischhoff, established a measurable model for risk perception. Risk is not only related to individual perception, argued anthropologist Mary Douglas and political scientist Aaron Wildavsky, but more importantly, should be seen as a \"joint product of knowledge about the future and consent about the most desired prospects\". 17 On this basis, they divided risks into three categories: social and political risk, economic risk, and natural risk, and attributed the evolution of social fabric to three distinct cultural types: hierarchical culture that sees social and political risk as the greatest risk, market individualistic culture that views economic risk as the greatest, and marginal culture that regards natural risk as the greatest. 13 Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens made \"risk\" a general term. In their statements about risk society, risk, as a basic feature of society and what is inherent in modernity, fundamentally changes the operational rules, dynamics and basic structure of industrial society. Beck argues that from the historical perspective of social evolution, risk distribution will overlap with and ultimately merge with wealth distribution. 18 Modern risks have shaken up the relationship between the present, the past and the future. It is no longer the past, but the risk of the future, that determines our choice today. 19 While in some areas and lifestyles, modernity has reduced the overall risk, but it has also introduced some new risk parameters that people had known little or nothing about in the past, and these parameters involve high-consequences risks deriving from the globalization of modern social system. 20 As Beck further pointed out, people may, for the first time, feel the sense of a kind of common destiny, because the threat is amplifying infinitely, the everyday consciousness of cosmopolitanism is awakened, and even the boundaries between mankind, animals and plants may be eliminated: whereas risk would contribute to the formation of risk society, global risk contributes to a global risk society. 21",

            "text": "The research traditions represented by the three core concepts, though relatively independent of each other, show a trend towards integration. In 1945, Gilbert White published his influential dissertation titled \"Human Adjustment to Floods\", starting to study natural disasters from the angle of human behavior. In 1978, he co-authored The Environment as Hazard with Ian Burton and Robert Kates, which for the first time shifts the focus of disaster mitigation from hazards and engineering to human reactions to disasters, pointing out that adjusting human behaviors helps relieve the impacts of and losses from disasters. Such transition not only has great influence on disaster research in natural sciences, but also given rise to a surge in social science research on disaster. Enrico Quarantelli, an influential American disaster scholar and founder of the Disaster Research Center (DRC), concluded after reviewing disaster research in the West in the past four decades that (1) the classification system that distinguishes between natural and man-made disasters cannot explain the social attributes of disasters, and it is better to divide disasters into consensus type and dissensus type. Consensus-type disasters are those where there is an agreement on the meaning of the situation, the norms and values that are appropriate, and priorities that should be followed. The dissensus-type disaster means there are sharply contrasting views of the nature of the situation, what brought it about, and what should be done to resolve it. 22 (2) Except in those extremely vulnerable areas, people generally pay little attention to disasters before they happen, whereas in regions frequently struck by disasters, relevant organizations and their activities will promote the formation of a disaster sub-culture. (3) Disasters usually cause visible psychological reactions such as insomnia, lack of appetite, and irritability, but these effects are non-clinical, selfhealing, and last for a short period. The victims rarely show functional inadaptability at home, school or work, and many of them could demonstrate similar syndromes even if the disaster had not happened. (4) Written emergency plans, though legally necessary, are by no means as important as emergency procedures. (5) The greater the disaster, the more likely new organizational structure and functions, hence greater difficulty in coordination. Hence, the key to catastrophe response is coordination. (6) The media play double roles, both as outsider and part of the emergency response system. These two roles are difficult to integrate. 23 According to Quarantelli, the Western social science studies of disaster have been very fruitful, though there are also serious challenges. For example, as scholars oriented in different disciplines join the disaster research, it is even difficult for them to agree on the definition of disaster; the differences in their understanding of basic concepts and assumptions tend to cause confusion and inconsistency. Quarantelli holds that it is necessary to get a big picture of the research subject by creating a new paradigm for disaster research. In this new paradigm, disaster is a type of crisis scenario, and theoretical analysis of risk will to a great extent influence the orientation of the disaster research in social sciences. 24 As for the trends of crisis and crisis management, Rosenthal thinks that future crisis will be essentially complex, a causal relationship full of uncertainty and a \"self-perpetuating circle\", and the key trends include transnationality, media, scientific and technological advances, and dissipation of government authority. 25 These views echo the theory of risk society.",

Whereas \"disaster\" (emergency) refers to all sorts of natural and man-made events that cause great losses, \"crisis\" refers to the impacts these events have produced on the closely interconnected, ever-changing and complicated world and \"risk\" refers to the causes of the disaster and crisis.

China's disaster management has gone through several stages, from disaster relief, disaster prevention and mitigation, to comprehensive disaster reduction, and is moving towards the stage of emergency management. In the face of disasters, in addition to primitive rituals, the most natural reaction of mankind is disaster relief. Early measures included rescue, tax relief, relocation, transfer of grain, and compensation. Later, measures such as building water conservancy facilities, adjusting plans and storing grain were developed for the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. At the stage of comprehensive disaster reduction, man-made disasters, in addition to natural disasters, were also included in the scope of disaster prevention and mitigation. From the 1950s, disaster management in China focused on disaster relief and disaster prevention at the early stage. The government successively set up disaster management agencies such as the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Central Disaster Relief Committee and the Ministry of Civil Affairs. After China joined the UN's program of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) in 1990, the concept of comprehensive disaster reduction gained popularity. After the close of the program, China International Disaster Reduction Commission established during the decade was renamed China National Commission for Disaster Reduction, and remains the country's top agency for natural disaster reduction. However, limited progress was made in comprehensive disaster reduction. For example, a majority of man-made disasters in China were work-related accidents, and the highest authority dealing with them was the State Administration of Work Safety, instead of the National Commission for Disaster Reduction. This situation did not change until the SARS outbreak in 2003. In response to the threats of new infectious diseases and frequent occurrence of other emergencies, the Chinese government decided to establish an emergency management system, at the core of which is a comprehensive strategy for emergency response that consists of plans, institutions, mechanisms and rules and regulations. In this system, \"disaster\" is replaced by the more abstract concept \"emergency\", which is broadly defined as \"a sudden natural disaster, accident, public health incident or public security incident that has caused or may cause serious social consequences, and warrants immediate action\", and response to such emergencies is referred to as \"emergency management\". Since then, at the institutional level, China has directly moved from the stage of disaster prevention and mitigation to comprehensive emergency management. ",

For example, the administrative accountability system began with the dismissal of then Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang and Mayor of Beijing Meng Xuenong, who were held accountable for ineffective response to the SARS outbreak. After that, it is common that officials are held accountable in the wake of emergencies. During the SARS outbreak, local authorities were required to report the number of confirmed cases, suspected cases, recovered patients and deaths and other data every day, and this promoted the establishment of the government information disclosure system. In addition, the approach of combining the institutions, mechanisms and rules and regulations to address major issues also originated from emergency management.",

The index method is straightforward and operable, and thus liable to draw attention from policymakers.

The basic presupposition of the index method is that risk is objective and quantifiable. In practice, researchers usually use the Delphi method to select indicators and assign weights, which in effect views risk as subjective, and this is logically conflicting. Moreover, the social system is too complicated to be compared to the computational system.

After sudden changes and fluctuations, two kinds of results will be produced: the original system will either collapse or hold on. In empirical research on social amplification of risk, some researchers applied the electronic model of 128 crises to database analysis, and to in-depth case study of risk-related community experiences. These analogies have been widely used in social risk research, but also aroused controversy and criticism.

Even in the United States, mitigation is still one of the weakest links in disaster management practices. There are mainly two reasons. First, mitigation measures are generally proposed by academics rather than policymakers, and it is not easy to turn research issues into policy issues; second, mitigation measures need to be implemented down to earth, but general management departments lack the motivation to do so, because it is disaster management departments, not them, that will be responsible for the consequences of inadequate mitigation. Thus mitigation is not merely a technological issue. Only by reflecting on the negative consequences of social action from time to time and internalizing them can individual behavior and habits, organizational social responsibility and government policy preferences be developed, and a risk culture be fostered. Therefore, how to cultivate a risk culture is an important issue that derives from mitigation.",

The quantity of emergency resources should be \"cost-effective\" and also depends on emergency management structure. On the one hand, the cost of emergency preparedness is definitely lower than the consequences of disasters, since governments at all levels need to provide funds for many undertakings apart from emergency management.

Past experience suggests that the greater the disaster, the more likely there will emerge new behavioral structures and functions at the crisis time. A fourfold typology captures the phenomena well. Type I organizations are established ones that do not markedly change their general structure and functions at times of crises (e.g. many police and fire departments maintain their traditional forms and spheres of activity). Type II organizations are expanding ones that have new structures but old functions, such as the Red Cross. Type III organizations are extending ones that have old structures but new functions (e.g. a construction company using its traditional group structure to undertake building or street debris clearance). Finally, Type IV groups are new entities that carry out new disaster functions, such as informal search and rescue teams, or damage assessment groups. It appears that the greater the disaster, the more likely there is an increasing involvement of the organized entities going from Type I through Type IV. An ordinary, everyday emergency could be handled only by Type I organizations, but a catastrophic disaster will require the presence of all four types of organized behavior. It goes without saying that the presence of many such groups of differing structures and functions creates major problems of coordination at the community level. 37 Just like the long-standing disputes over regional cooperation and hierarchical response in the above-mentioned government emergency structure, opinions are divided over which coordination mode is better: command-control, or cooperation. While the United States, where the cooperation mode dominates, has seen signs of the rise of the \"command-control\" mode, China should, in addition to sticking to the government-led \"command-control\" mode, make better use of the cooperation mode characterized by timely and flexible response. The cooperation mode can be adopted not only in dealing with everyday emergencies and community disasters but also in responding to catastrophes, as government agencies themselves may be paralyzed after the occurrence of a catastrophe. For example, after a devastating earthquake hit Wenchuan of Sichuan Province on May 12, 2008, a large number of non-governmental organizations, public interest organizations, and volunteers worked with government departments in disaster relief, playing an irreplaceable role in early disaster response.",

Moreover, although the \"disaster chain\" theory believes risks are changing rather than in stable form, its study of risk dynamics still follows a linear pattern. Judging from the reality and future trends, risk is becoming more and more nonlinear. Demography, the environment, technology and socio-economic structure have transformed traditional risk, but have given risen to new risks, changed the vulnerability of populations to risk, and transformed how impact spreads, leading to some kind of comprehensive impact. 43 Second, risk is becoming more difficult to measure. In traditional risk measurement models, actuaries of insurance companies usually use loss frequency and degree as well as expected value and standard deviation of loss in a given period of time to measure loss probability distribution. Loss frequency is defined as the number of loss occurrences over a given time interval. If historical data of risk units are available, the probability of loss per risk unit can be estimated by dividing the number of risk units into loss frequency; and the degree of loss represents the scale of loss caused by an incident. 44 Now, risk has become a general term and essentially unmeasurable. According to Beck, nuclear risk, chemical product risk, genetic engineering risk and ecological calamity risk have completely destroyed the four pillars of risk calculation. 45 Specifically, first, these catastrophes often cause irreparable global damage that makes monetary compensation in risk calculation meaningless; second, in the worst-case scenario, the safety concepts endowed by risk calculation, including damage control and early-warning and monitoring of the consequences, are also meaningless; third, the spatial-temporal scopes and boundaries of disaster disappear completely, making calculation impossible; finally, the impact of disaster no longer has a conventional form, so risk calculation would have no result. Certainly, this does not mean that researchers should abandon risk calculation altogether. Anyway, risk calculation is always better than nothing, as long as we do not blindly believe the results of risk calculation or take it as the only standard of risk management.",

Three branches of management have responded differently: researchers in managerial science and engineering try to answer some specific technical questions, such as the optimal algorithm for emergency facilities site selection and emergency resources dispatch; business management researchers work to provide effective management tools for enterprises, such as how to deal with operational difficulties as a result of product quality defects; and public administration researchers seek to provide the government with optimal institutional design, such as disaster response regulations. The core of disaster response is coordination, and the prerequisite of coordination is consensus on issues among different types and levels of organizational actors. Distributed cognition is such a methodological exploration. As a \"social-technical\" approach, it demonstrates a systematic effort to improve the structured learning process to support decision makers in taking coordinated action in the face of threats. It is an interdisciplinary task in itself, in which anthropology extends cognition beyond individuals, psychology explores the cognitive process by giving meaning, network analysis provides methods for understanding cognitive structures in complex environments, and computer science provides technological means for computational simulation of complicated information exchange between networks. 46 To answer the question of what optimal emergency structure is, a set of emergency performance evaluation methods must be developed. Based on case studies and quantitative evaluation, a high-quality case database should be established and emergency performance of each case be calculated in order to compare the performance of different emergency structures. As to what optimal resource allocation is, research methods must be introduced to work out optimal resource allocation schemes. It goes without saying that resource allocation is not just a technical issue, but needs to bring in research approaches of political science and public policy.",

On the one hand, risk identification makes disaster response possible, as the type and level of risk defined through risk identification provides the basis for disaster response; on the other hand, disaster response must be based on risk identification, because both optimal structure and optimal resource allocation of disaster response can be boiled down to \"ability\" which is a relative concept based on specific risk types and risk levels. It is not advisable to require communities to have the ability to cope with catastrophes, or provincial governments to deal only with ordinary disasters. Combining risk research with disaster research makes the calculation of value at risk meaningless. 47 Instead of judging the best time for intervention by calculating value at risk, we are now trying to deal with risk through building emergency response capacity.",

In 1972, the Club of Rome published The Limits to Growth, a research report written by Dennis Meadows and other young scientists. They used system dynamics models and high-speed computers to simulate the complicated relationships among twelve factors, including demography, energy, the environment, water, health and economic development. On this basis, the report predicts that the world systems may collapse because of the energy crisis, and growth may come to a halt in 2100. This is a prediction of catastrophe for mankind as a whole and has had significant impacts worldwide. Ilya Prigogine's dissipative structure theory is based on uncertainty. It holds that an open system can absorb negative entropy flow from the outside by exchanging materials and energy, thus reducing its own entropy and forming a far-from-equilibrium orderly structure called dissipative structure. French mathematician Rene Thom created catastrophe theory to describe the stable and unstable states of a system. Social scientists should borrow the dissipative structure theory and catastrophe theory to study the catastrophe and collapse of the complex system of society.",

When the system acquires information, disorder, or entropy, decreases; the more information acquired, the greater decrease in disorder (entropy); and a decrease in system disorder (entropy) means an increase in order and organization of the system. In the social science study of disaster, risk means the possibility and uncertainty of loss, and crisis is the loss after such possibility and uncertainty become reality. Loss, in essence, is a disturbance to the order of social system and people's normal lives. Therefore, the social science study of disaster will benefit a lot from borrowing the concept of entropy and relevant knowledge from natural sciences.",
