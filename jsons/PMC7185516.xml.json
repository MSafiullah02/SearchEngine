For example, changes in the dominant lineages of the fecal microbiota were observed when mice were moved to different locations within the same facility (Friswell et al., 2010) and differences have been noted in the same strain bred in different centres (Hufeldt, Nielsen, Vogensen, Midtvedt, & Hansen, 2010). In addition, strain-dependent alterations in environmental enrichment have been linked to differences in immunological parameters in mice (Marashi, Barnekow, Ossendorf, & Sachser, 2003). Environmental considerations are important when designing immunological studies since the gut bacterial community continuously interacts with the immune system both directly and indirectly through microbial-derived antigens and metabolic products (Slack et al., 2009).",

For example, segmented filamentous bacteria and polysaccharide A of Bacteroides fragilis have been shown to induce Treg populations (Hooper & Macpherson, 2010). Metabolic products such as propionate are involved in maintenance of a regulatory immune milieu in the colon of specific pathogen free mice (C. Smith, Rocha, & Paster, 2006) and SCFA influence immune activity at the systemic level (Maslowski et al., 2009), as do microbial components able to act as TLR or NOD ligands (Balmer et al., 2014). Factors influencing bacterial community composition may, therefore, affect immune outcomes at mucosal and systemic levels.",

The Canadian Council of Animal Care strongly suggests the use of plastic cages and bedding for rodents (Canadian Council on Animal Care, 1993). Recommendations also include pair housing (when possible) and replacing wire cages with solid platforms or bedding (National Research Council (NRC), 2011) to alleviate stress, which appears to affect cecal microbial diversity in mice (Bangsgaard Bendtsen et al., 2012). Ingestion of bedding material is a concern (Le Leu, Conlon, Bird, & Clarke, 2015) as is coprophagy (Levine & Saltzman, 1999) in studies examining immune and gut community changes associated with dietary fibre consumption since these can affect nutritional measures. Here, we have examined the effect of two different types of housing (woodchip bedding vs wire-bottomed cages) on various mucosal and systemic immune parameters, the fecal bacterial community structure, and fecal metabolic activity. This study was undertaken to address animal care committee criticisms concerning the use of wire bottomed cages when studying the functional properties of fermentable materials. We found that the use of bedding adds additional complexities to nutritional studies by altering bacterial community composition and immune parameters in the absence of dietary change.",

A total of 2 animals were required to measure all the parameters of interest. Thus, 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 animals/group were required for the study. Rats were transferred from the breeding room to the housing room (same facility) at the start of the experiment and housed individually for 63\u201367 d with free access to an AIN93G purified diet (Reeves, Nielsen, & Fahey, 1993) containing 5% w/w alphacel (cellulose) and reverse-osmosis treated water. This period was well in excess of the 7 days required to stabilise bacterial community changes after alterations in diet (Kalmokoff et al., 2013). Rats were subjected to a 12 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 21 \u00b0C and cages and bedding were changed once per week. All rats were provided with shelters, glass marble toys and music. During the final two weeks of the study (d49-end), all food intake was monitored and all feces were collected (balance phase). Animals were killed by exsanguination under anesthesia. Serum samples were collected at necropsy. This study was approved by the Animal Care Committees of Health Canada and the University Of Ontario Institute Of Technology.",

Ribosomal genes were amplified using the primers F44/R1543 and cloned following 12 cycles of amplification (Kalmokoff et al., 2013). One hundred clones were randomly selected from each duplicate clone library (2 \u00d7 100 clones/housing) and sequenced. Near full length 16S rRNA clones were initially aligned against the Silva data base (Quast et al., 2013) and sequences demonstrating <3% DNA sequence divergence binned into the dominant phylotype. The data was checked for chimeric sequences using subroutines available in Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009).

Following the addition of 10 mL anaerobic 0.1% peptone water, the pellets were mixed to obtain homogenous slurries, and subjected to a 10-fold dilution series.

This change resulted primarily from the enrichment of phylotypes aligning within the families Lactobacillaceae (Lactobacillus) and Erysipelotrichaceae at the expense of those aligning within the family Bacteroidaceae (Bacteroides). These general trends in the 16S rRNA-based analysis were confirmed by qPCR and anaerobic plating. Lactobacilli have an absolute requirement for peptidyl-nitrogen (De Man et al., 1960, Kandler and Weiss, 1986), whereas genera within the family Bacteroidaceae use ammonia as a source of nitrogen for growth (C. Smith et al., 2006). Thus, increases in the content of Lactobacillus likely reflect increases in the availability of peptidyl-nitrogen sources in the gut (Kalmokoff et al., 2015).

In bedding-housed rats, the shift towards acetate at the expense of propionate was consistent with the decrease in the family Bacteroidaceae, as propionate production is common across this taxa (C. Smith et al., 2006). Furthermore, branched chain fatty acid concentrations (produced by the fermentation of valine, isovaline and lysine) were also significantly lower in feces from bedding housed rats compared to those housed on wire, which likely reflects an increased use of gut peptidyl-nitrogen to support continued growth rather than as an energy source (i.e., protein fermentation (E. A. Smith & Macfarlane, 1998)). Changes in gut community metabolic activity may also result from the fermentation of the bedding material used to house rats (Le Leu et al., 2015). However, it is unlikely that this material affected SCFA profiles for the following reasons: (i) fecal output was not affected by housing indicating that rats ingested only a very small amount of bedding material; (ii) woodchips (primarily cellulose) are fermented to a limited extent (Davies, Brown, & Livesey, 1991); and (iii) the cellulose content of the AIN93G diet (5%) is in great excess to any amount of ingested bedding.",

            "text": "While changes in the fecal community of rats housed on bedding may be explained on the basis of increased peptidyl-nitrogen in the gut, the primary question is the source of this material. Since both groups were fed only the AIN93G diet and showed no difference in total food consumption, we suggest that the most likely source for the additional dietary protein would be from feces. In fact, coprophagy has long been known to be a concern in bedding housed rats, altering the cultivable fecal community (Fitzgerald, Gustafsson, & McDaniel, 1964) and, depending on the diet, improving weight gain by providing an additional (microbial) source of dietary protein (Midtvedt and Gustafsson, 1981, Torrallardona et al., 1996). Increasing dietary protein content via increased coprophagy could explain both the shift in community structure and changes to the overall community metabolic activity observed in rats housed on bedding. The changes in fecal community diversity are also consistent with observations in previous rodent studies. For example, anal cupping of rats to prevent coprophagy significantly reduced cultivable fecal Lactobacilli (Fitzgerald et al., 1964). Similarly, disrupting the normal behaviour of mice (i.e., coprophagy) by physical relocation resulted in a short term transition in the fecal community structure to one where phylotypes homologous with Lactobacilli decreased, while those homologous with Flavobacterium (Phylum Bacteroidetes) and aligning within the order Clostridiales increased (Ma et al., 2012). These changes are similar to those observed here in the fecal community of wire housed rats.",

At the systemic level, splenic IL-4 concentrations were higher in bedding-housed rats relative to wire-housed rats. Both dietary and gut bacterial components can influence systemic immune measures at the spleen (Neyrinck, Mouson, & Delzenne, 2007). The ileum is more permeable than the colon and translocated bacteria and bacterial components from the ileum have previously been shown to affect host immune parameters in distal locations (Schulz & Pabst, 2013). Although ascertaining whether gut-derived factors had translocated across the epithelium into the circulation was outside of the scope of the current study, effects at the systemic level would be in keeping with the possibility of bedding-associated damage and IL-6-mediated repair at the ileum. Tissue injury stimulates intestinal epithelial cells to produce IL-6 (Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004) and the rodent gut mucosa has been shown to be sensitive to abrasion by fibrous substrates such as wheat bran (Perrin et al., 2001). One possible explanation is that the ingested wood chip material resulted in minor abrasive injuries during transit through the gut. The gut of female rats is more resistant to inflammation-induced injury (Homma et al., 2005) and \u03b2-estradiol ordinarily regulates levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6) in the intestinal tissue of female rats (Kilicdag et al., 2016) suggesting that the bedding-associated increase in ileal IL-6 levels reflected epithelial repair rather than inflammation.",

Although the authors did not report on cytokine levels, their results suggest a compromised barrier function in animals housed on wood bedding, which agrees with our observation of a local mucosal and systemic immune effect. The type of wood is also important. For example, softwood bedding induced liver drug-metabolising enzymes as well as reduced time spent asleep in rats and mice, and this was reversed by housing on hardwood bedding (Vesell, 1967). In agreement with these observations, we observed no effect of hardwood bedding on liver enzyme levels. Hardwood chip housing can be beneficial; it is superior in reducing ammonia volatiles when animals are housed in static air-flow cages (the cages used for bedding in this study) (Smith, Stockwell, Schweitzer, Langley, & Smith, 2004). Cotton bedding and paper can be problematic if total fecal output is to be measured, as we have observed considerable ingestion of these types of materials in other experiments.",

While alternative approaches such as rectal cups or constrained tube enclosures can be applied to prevent this, wire bottom cages likely remain the most humane and practical approach for nutritional studies where this may be of concern.
