The first IgA1 protease was discovered in 1973 (Mehta, Plaut, Calvanico, & Tomasi, 1973), and subsequently several species of pathogenic bacteria were found to produce IgA1 protease including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis (Plaut, Gilbert, Artenstein, & Capra, 1975; Mulks, Kornfeld, & Plaut, 1980). This group of proteolytic enzymes was found to cleave specific proline-serine and proline-threonine peptide bonds within the sequence TPPTPSPSTPPTPSPS (T, P and S are threonine, proline and serine residues, respectively) found in the hinge region of human IgA1 (Frangione & Wolfenstein-Todel, 1972). The IgA1 proteases were therefore thought to be an important virulence factor, which influenced colonisation and infection of bacteria at the mucosal surfaces.",

The IgA1 protease is described as an autotransporter, as the protein encodes all the information required for the protein to transport itself out of the cell. The beta domain has been shown to insert into the outer membrane and one model of secretion suggests the beta domain forms a pore in the membrane (Halter, Pohlner, & Meyer, 1984) (Fig. 2B). However recent studies suggest that several beta domain proteins are required to group together to form a pore structure for the protease domains to traverse the outer membrane (Veiga, Sugawara, Nikaido, de Lorenzo, & Fernandez, 2002) (Fig. 2C).",

They invoke a strong immunogenic response in vivo and antibodies to IgA1 proteases have been detected in patients during acute disease, colonisation and recovery (Brooks, Lammel, Blake, Kusecek, & Achtman, 1992). However, the IgA1 proteases are highly heterogeneic and inhibiting antibodies produced during previous infections do not neutralise the IgA1 proteases of new strains of bacteria. This is thought to be one mechanism of evasion from host defences. In addition, higher concentrations of IgA1 proteases have been detected in patients with acute infection compared to asymptomatic carriers (Vitovski, Dunkin, Howard, & Sayers, 2002), suggesting increased immunogenicity during such episodes, perhaps as a result of bacterial invasion.",

In vivo, IgA1 proteases have also been found to activate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and also CD19(+) B cells and CD56(+) natural killer cells.

            "text": "As the IgA1 proteases are thought to be virulence factors in bacterial infection, the inactivation of IgA1 protease proteolytic activity should reduce bacterial colonisation and infection in vivo. Synthetic inhibitors with an analogous structure to the natural substrate (the human IgA1 hinge region) have been found to inactivate the protease by competitive inhibition (Burton, Wood, Lynch, & Plaut, 1988). Smaller synthetic peptides have also been found to be potent inhibitors of the serine-type IgA1 protease (Bachovchin et al., 1990). The role of these peptides in protection of mucosal surfaces has yet to be explored. Alternatively specific monoclonal antibodies could be produced to block the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes by steric hindrance. Whether such an approach is likely to be effective also requires further study.",

These early investigations have since led to the application of this technology to immobilise heavy metals in soil. A fusion protein of the mouse metallothionein I protein and the beta domain autotransporter has been used to target the mouse metallothionein I protein to the cell surface of Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus). The R. eutropha strain was able to reduce CD2(+) toxicity in polluted soils and enabled the growth of Nicotiana bentamiana tobacco plants (Valls, Atrian, de Lorenzen, & Fernandez, 2000a). Similarly, the metallothionein-beta domain fusion protein was expressed in Pseudomonas putida with a view to utilising this bacteria in heavy metal adsorption of industrial sewage (Valls, de Lorenzen, Gonzalez-Duarte, & Atrian, 2000b).",

They are produced in low concentrations, but are highly potent proteolytic enzymes, which specifically cleave peptide bonds within a restricted sequence in the hinge region of human IgA1. They also invoke a strong antigenic response although their heterogeneic nature allows the enzymes to evade the human immune system in sequential infections. The cleavage of human IgA1 produces intact Fab fragments, which have been shown to bind antigenic receptors, thereby masking surface epitopes from intact and functional antibodies and the loss of the Fc fragment eliminates the agglutination activity of IgA1. These observations suggest that IgA1 proteases may be important virulence factors central to the colonisation of mucosal surfaces by bacteria.",
