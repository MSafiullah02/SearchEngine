Points are given for age, gender, co-morbid illness, physical examination findings, ABG analysis, blood chemistry, hematocrit and chest X-ray findings and score is calculated. Patients are classified as PSI I to V according to their final score with mortality ranging from 0.1% to 27% respectively. It has superior ability to detect low risk patients. PSI I & II can be managed as an outpatient whereas IV and V needs hospitalisationCURB-65: It consists of 5 core elements (new onset Confusion, Urea > 20 mg/dl, RR > 30 bpm, SBP < 90 mmHg or DBP < 60 mmHg, Age 65 years or older, 1 point each for a total of 5). CURB 65 of 0 can be managed as outpatient, CURB 65 1&2 generally require ward treatment and a score of 3 or more warrants inpatient and aggressive treatment, usually in the ICU. It has superior ability to detect high risk patients. A simpler version of this score the CRB-65, does away with urea measurement without losing it effectiveness to detect high risk patients. Some studies have suggested an age group of \u2265 80 years (CRB-80) to have better predictability for mortality.2007 ATS/IDSA criteria for ICU admission for CAP: It consists of 2 major (invasive mechanical ventilation, septic shock requiring vasopressors) and 9 minor criteria (confusion, RR > 30 bpm, PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 249, multilobar infiltrates, BUN>20 mg/dL, WBC < 4000/mm3, platelet count<1,000,000/mm3, temperature < 36 \u00b0C, hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation). Presence of 1 major or 3 minor criterion requires admission to ICU. It has the ability to predict ICU admission with 84% sensitivity and 78% specificity.\n",

Those patients of severe CAP admitted through the emergency department (ED) should receive the first dose of antibiotic in the ED itself.Blood and sputum cultures should be sent for antibiotic sensitivity testing before starting antibiotics but this should not delay the initiation of antibiotic therapy.The initial choice of antibiotic will depend on a detailed and in-depth history with particular emphasis on identifying etiology of CAP (see Table 12.1) and whether the patient is at risk for infection with drug resistant organisms (see Table 12.2).The initial choices of antibiotics in patient with no risk factors are:A Beta-lactam/Beta lactamase inhibitor (Amoxicillin-clavulanate, Ampicillin-sulbactum, OR a cephalosporin (Cefuroxime, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone) plus a Macrolide (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin)/Doxycycline/respiratory Fluoroquinolone (Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin).ORA Beta-lactam (Amoxicillin-clavulanate, Ampicillin-sulbactum, Cefuroxime, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone) plus Aztreonam (for patients with penicillin allergy).The initial choices of antibiotics in patient with risk factors for infection with drug resistant organisms are mentioned below.Pseudomonas or Extended spectrum beta- lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms are suspected\u2014antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal Beta-lactam (Piperacillin-tazobactam, Cefepime/Ceftazidime/Avibactam /Cefoperazone sulbactam) or Carbapenem (Imipenem, Meropenem) plus antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin)/Doxycycline /Macrolide OR.Antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal Beta-lactam (Piperacillin-tazobactam, Cefepime) plus Aminoglycoside (Amikacin) plus Macrolide (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin)/antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin)/Doxycycline.[Replace beta-lactam with Aztreonam in patients with penicillin allergy].Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is suspected- Give Colistin.Suspicion of MRSA\u2014Add Vancomycin or Linezolid.In persons with risk of aspiration (CVA, seizures, dysphagia, vomiting, head or neck cancer)\u2014Add Metronidazole or Clindamycin.Antibiotics which have been started should cover common microorganisms causing pneumonia (both typical and atypical organisms covered), should be used parenterally and in adequate dose and frequency, keeping in mind pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug.

Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV): NIV is tried cautiously in patients with hypoxemia and increased work of breathing (respiratory distress), especially those with COPD or bronchial asthma. These patients are closely monitored and if no improvement is apparent after 2 h, may be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Patients with severe hypoxemia or bilateral/multilobar infiltrates and having respiratory distress should receive immediate invasive mechanical ventilation. Steroids: Patients with vasopressor resistant shock are given low dose intravenous steroids. Patients with COPD or Bronchial asthma on oral steroids are continued on equivalent intravenous doses of steroids. The routine use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy for severe CAP with brisk inflammatory response has been suggested by some RCTs and meta-analyses but as per the latest guidelines, it is not recommended. Steroids should be used only in the presence of septic shock not responding to vasopressor therapy, as per the surviving sepsis guidelines.Avoid steroid in patients with Viral and Aspergillus pneumonia, Immunosuppressed host and Uncontrolled diabetic.Patients with severe CAP should receive routine supportive ICU measures.\n",
