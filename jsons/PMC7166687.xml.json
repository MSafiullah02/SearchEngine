            "text": "Among the many challenges to public health, infectious diseases remain an underlying source of global health concern that continues to garner considerable local and national attention (Wong et al. 2012). Despite remarkable advances in the efficacy of preventive and curative measures against infection, these diseases still account for approximately 10 million deaths worldwide per year and impose an onerous burden on global health (Morse 2012). In recent decades, emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have created an increasing impetus for reinforcement of infectious disease preparedness planning. This group of diseases, which refers to newly recognised infectious diseases or known infections that present with an increased incidence and geographic range in the recent past or foreseeable future [World Health Organization (WHO 2005)], represent the majority of recent large\u2010scale public health emergencies, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic in 2009 (Leppin & Aro 2009) and the Ebola virus disease epidemic in 2014 (Chertow et al. 2014). Recently, a sharp increase in human infections from a new strain of coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome, has been reported, which poses a new challenge to the global health care system and the capacity of institutions regarding outbreak management (Cowling et al. 2015).",

Emergency nurses, in view of the frequency and intensity of close patient contact, are in an ideal position for disease surveillance. Their involvement in infection control and disease prevention can also help to reduce the risk of disease exposure of the wider population in the community (Lam & Hung 2013). With the increasing prevalence of EIDs, the workflows of AEDs would require adjustments to meet the altered health care demands and targets. Major changes to the practice of emergency nursing care delivery are often incorporated into workflow modifications to enhance disease surveillance and infection control (Blachere et al. 2009). With a view to assist emergency nurses to embed these changes into their everyday work, guidelines are formulated and implemented in routine practice. These guidelines can provide recommendations and instructions to inform emergency nurses' judgment regarding logistic arrangements, infection control practices, service standards and cross\u2010departmental collaboration, which are crucial elements in efficient epidemic management (Carter et al. 2014).",

            "text": "However, disparities between guideline adherence and nurses' practice are frequently reported to undermine the successful implementation of guidelines into practice. Nichol et al. (2008) noted that the general compliance of nurses with newly introduced guidelines and protocols was usually low, which might be related to their reluctance to change their usual practice. More specifically, there was a breach in safety procedures and infection control. Mounting evidence shows that adherence to guidelines regarding infection control, such as hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is seriously inadequate among nurses in a variety of health care settings (Pan et al. 2008, Efstathiou et al. 2011). Notwithstanding, studies have mainly emphasised the adherence to safety procedures in infection control; detailed studies investigating compliance to infection control guidelines on the rearrangement of workflow and routine practice are sparse. Also, because most of the investigations to date have studied guideline implementation in general care settings, issues regarding guideline adherence and nurses' practice in infectious disease management in emergency care settings remain poorly understood (Carter et al. 2014). In seeking to ensure a timely and appropriate response to impending outbreaks, this study was conducted to offer a sound understanding of the unique features of guideline implementation in the course of an epidemic event in an emergency care context.",

The process of gathering detailed information offers insights into the complexity and diversity of individuals' experiences. The broader scope covered by qualitative strategies can then be used to extract rich descriptions of the individuals' perceptions and behaviours within the content and context of the phenomenon of interest (Creswell 2012). Inasmuch as qualitative investigations can facilitate the illumination of individualised perspectives throughout a process, it is considered to be particularly appropriate in establishing the extent to which a programme or a protocol has been appropriately implemented (Patton 2015). Therefore, a qualitative research design was chosen as the method of inquiry in this study to delineate an in\u2010depth exploration of emergency nurses' perceptions and behaviours in guideline implementation.",

Five local acute care hospital sites were selected to involve those with isolation facilities of a high standard and those that offered a full range of emergency services. Frontline emergency nurses were recruited from the AEDs of the five hospitals with a purposive sampling technique. This sampling strategy entails the selection of participants who have the potential to provide rich and relevant information pertinent to the study (Streubert & Carpenter 1995). Criteria for participant selection were as follows: (1) at least one year of work experience in emergency nursing services, (2) involvement in frontline patient care, and (3) willingness to share his or her experiences in responding to guideline implementation in the management of EIDs.",

Interviews are widely used in qualitative research as an interactive and flexible method that allows researchers to gather information from participants\u2019 narratives and conversations (Chenitz & Swanson 1986, Winpenny & Glass 2000). Over the course of a semi\u2010structured interview, that is, an interview without a rigid set of close\u2010ended questions for the participants, flexibility is granted to informants to express their perspectives from different dimensions (Robertson & Boyle 1984, Minichiello et al. 1990). Nonetheless, an interview agenda was developed to guide the theme of coverage to maintain a consistency of focus throughout the interviews (Rose 1994, Briggs 2000). The participants were allowed to select the venues for the interviews on the premise of privacy and confidentiality. Interviews were conducted in Chinese and began with a general question: \u2018Please tell me about your experience in upholding the guidelines for management of emerging infectious diseases.\u2019 Subsequent open\u2010ended questions were asked by the interviewers according to the interview agenda. Probing questions were asked to clarify statements that were vague or ambiguous (Barriball & While 1994). All interviews were audio\u2010recorded with the participants\u2019 permission.

An indexing scheme was initiated by breaking the information down into discrete segments of meaning units.

This sentiment was echoed by another participant, who pointed out the lack of discretion for workflow planning as follows:A new ward was opened to handle the patient surge caused by EIDs. For the workflow arrangement and guidelines of the ward, there was next to no planning by the administrators on feasibility before application. Various problems arose after implementing those guidelines, including staff reallocation and patient logistics\u2026 this could have been avoided if the flows and guidelines were planned more wisely.

The results illustrate that the guideline\u2010practice gaps can be accounted for by inadequate provision of corresponding administrative and organisational support, in terms of manpower, facilities and policies, after the launch of the guidelines in practice. These findings are consistent with those in the literature that show that transferring guidelines into clinical practice is greatly influenced by the practice environment, including the availability of resources and leadership responsiveness (Graham et al. 2004). In fact, the perceived impracticality of the guidelines was repeatedly cited by the participants, who highlighted the fundamental shortcomings on administrative leadership in showing responsiveness to the constituent concerns of the environmental constraints in the workplace. These findings are in agreement with those of May et al. (2014), who reviewed the constituents of implementation of nursing clinical practice guidelines in the literature. Their review summarised the results from the studies of Ploeg et al. (2007) and Yagasaki and Komatsu (2011), which identified that the adherence of guidelines among nurses could be adversely influenced and the applicability of integrating guidelines was impeded by constraints in clinical settings. The limited applicability of guidelines as reported in the current study could be explained by the top\u2010down planning approach that is commonly adopted in various health care organisations for guideline formulation (Mintzberg 2012). This top\u2010down approach refers to a strategy of decision\u2010making regarding processes that involves the participation only of administrative personnel at the senior level (Meslin 2009). Without the participation of frontline personnel, the imposed guidelines and policies often deviate from their expectations and capacities and limit the uptake of guidelines into workflow (Ploeg et al. 2007). Therefore, the need for subsequent evaluation of the processes and outcomes regarding guideline implementation are highlighted to examine the feasibility and workability of guidelines in existing situations.",

            "text": "Among the various environmental constraints that challenge guideline implementation in workplaces among emergency nurses, the aspects of time and facility constraints have received considerable attention. The participants in this study indicated that time constraints imposed by their excessive workload interfered with their engagement with guidelines such as hand hygiene practices and PPE usage. In accordance with the present results, previous studies have shown that heavy workloads and inadequate staffing could inhibit nurses from implementing new guidelines into practice, inasmuch as the guidelines produced additional work and duties for them (Ploeg et al. 2007, Lam & Hung 2013, Matthew\u2010Maich et al. 2013). In addition to time constraints, facility constraints, particularly regarding respiratory isolation rooms in AEDs, were seen by the participants as another major barrier to successful guideline implementation. Although the importance of spatial separation in controlling respiratory contagion was generally acknowledged by the participants, the difficulties inherent in isolation facility limitations had inhibited them from implementing quarantine measures for suspected patients. This finding is comparable to that of Martel et al. (2013), in which a low compliance rate of emergency nurses to appropriate patient isolation was identified as a result of the constrained practice environment. Furthermore, it is somewhat surprising to reveal from the present findings that access to emergency care for patients in critical condition could be impeded because resuscitation facilities are occupied for respiratory isolation. Although the dual use of facilities is a seemingly helpful method to enhance the effective use of available resources, particularly in the management of unexpected patient upsurges (Hick et al. 2004), prudent consideration of facility planning is essential for hospital administrators to prevent affecting the usual standards of health care services. Thus, clinical guidelines should be devised in conjunction with surge planning to enhance patient care surge capacity during the management of large\u2010scale epidemic events.",

Consistent with this finding, much of the current literature on guideline implementation pays particular attention to organisational efforts in coordination and promotion of uptake of practice guidelines among health care personnel (Ploeg et al. 2007, Farrar & Piot 2014). In fact, it has been suggested that organisational coordination supports successful implementation not merely in articulating the definitions and standards of the guidelines, but by also creating buy\u2010in for the guidelines by establishing communication between units and departments (Matthew\u2010Maich et al. 2013). These findings were complemented by the study of Choi et al. (2011), which noted that managerial support, in terms of effective communication and coordination with subordinates, was of particular importance in promoting nursing practice in chaotic situations, such as infectious disease outbreaks. In the same vein, participants in this study valued assistance from departmental management in conveying their concerns regarding guideline implementation on behalf of the frontline personnel, and they emphasised the importance of effective communication between frontline personnel and the administration in successful guideline implementation. The findings offer needed insight into the administration's role in enhancing guideline implementation by reinforcing intraorganisational and interorganisational coordination.",

In this context, there are similarities between the opinions expressed by the participants in this study and those described by Pretz and Folse (2011). These authors explained that experienced nurses might have developed a structured knowledge base by accumulation of clinical experience, which helped them adapt to novel situations. As implied in the findings of this study, the participants took into account their clinical experience in responding to the problematic issue of guideline implementation, which suggest the relevance of tacit knowledge \u2013 that is, knowledge based upon individual experiences, insights and intuitions \u2013 in clinical judgment. Indeed, the decision\u2010making processes of nurses frequently involve the interaction of tacit and explicit knowledge (Kothari et al. 2012). It became evident throughout the participants' descriptions that the application of tacit and explicit knowledge is one of the most decisive parameters of their adaptive capacity in bridging the guideline\u2010practice gaps for management of an epidemic event. Although there is mounting emphasis in the literature on the adaptive capacity of health care institutions and systems, recent studies have suggested that the individual adaptive capacity of workers at the forefront of health care delivery shows increasing importance to organisational effectiveness in coping with contingencies and changed situations in large\u2010scale health care emergencies (Rumsey et al. 2014). The findings of this study offer needed insight into strategies to empower the adaptive capacity of frontline emergency nurses in response to public health events. To promote the development of adaptive capacity, strategies to develop and transfer tacit knowledge among emergency nurses should be taken into consideration in formulating measures to enhance their preparedness for imminent EID outbreaks and other large\u2010scale public health emergencies.",

Their involvement in the planning process could provide practical information to allow policymakers to better tailor the protocols and ensure that they are compatible with current practices (Batcheller et al. 2004). Also, the participation of frontline leaders could also improve the efficiency of guidelines by means of appropriate modifications to address the actual needs of frontline personnel in clinical situations (Matthew\u2010Maich et al. 2013).",

The findings in this study highlight the need to strengthen cross\u2010departmental communication so as to ensure coherent understanding of terms and instructions and the consistent implementation of guidelines. Other studies have indicated that the dissemination of information over the course of infectious disease outbreaks could be chaotic because information provided by the administrators was excessive and inconsistent (Lam & Hung 2013). Thus, health care administrators should not only merely disseminate information among personnel across services but also appropriately streamline the guidelines and instructions to facilitate their integration into routine practice.",

Regular monitoring is critical for policymakers to track the progress of guideline implementation and to assess whether the intended positive outcomes have been achieved (Grol et al. 2013). A clinical audit, as incorporated in a number of health care systems, might serve the purpose of quality monitoring. This method has been proposed as an efficient and effective means to assess the quality of practice and promote quality improvement (Pedersen et al. 2014). However, health care professionals might be unwilling to participate in auditing because they perceive the process as criticising and faultfinding (Bowie et al. 2012). To ensure smooth audits, their purposes and procedures should be clearly articulated to frontline personnel to avoid misconceptions.",

Another limitation involves the timing of the investigation. Because the focus of this study was issues\u2010related to guideline implementation in response to EIDs, the ideal data collection time would be in the midst of an outbreak. Since there had been no recent outbreaks of disease, data collection was scheduled right after the announcement of the emergence of a new strain of avian flu (H7N9) in December 2013.
