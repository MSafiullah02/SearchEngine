This study examined how CD4 T cells affect primary and secondary anti-viral CD8 T-cell responses within the central nervous system (CNS) during encephalomyelitis induced by sublethal gliatropic coronavirus. CD4 T-cell depletion before infection did not impair peripheral expansion, interferon-c production, CNS recruitment or initial CNS effector capacity of virus-specific CD8 T cells ex vivo. Nevertheless, impaired virus control in the absence of CD4 T cells was associated with gradually diminished CNS CD8 T-cell interferon-c production. Furthermore, within the CD8 T-cell population short-lived effector cells were increased and memory precursor effector cells were significantly decreased, consistent with higher T-cell turnover. Transfer of memory CD8 T cells to reduce viral load in CD4-depleted mice reverted the recipient CNS CD8 T-cell phenotype to that in wild-type control mice. However, memory CD8 T cells primed without CD4 T cells and transferred into infected CD4-sufficient recipients expanded less efficiently and were not sustained in the CNS, contrasting with their helped counterparts. These data suggest that CD4 T cells are dispensable for initial expansion, CNS recruitment and differentiation of primary resident memory CD8 T cells as long as the duration of antigen exposure is limited. By contrast, CD4 T cells are essential to prolong primary CD8 T-cell function in the CNS and imprint memory CD8 T cells for recall responses.",

            "text": "A major role of CD4 T cells during infections is to support priming, programming and/or effector function of CD8 T cells. Help can be provided by cytokine production or regulation of co-stimulatory factors, such as CD40/CD40 ligand via antigen-presenting cells. 1, 2 Nevertheless, the requirement for CD4 T-cell help in primary CD8 T-cell responses is not universal and depends on the in vivo milieu during initial T-cell activation. Primary CD8 T-cell responses against infectious agents are mostly CD4 T-cell independent, whereas responses to non-inflammatory stimulation or non-replicating vaccines are dependent on CD4 T-cell help. [3] [4] [5] [6] Irrespective of the requirement for CD4 T-cell help for primary CD8 T-cell responses, it is accepted that CD4 T-cell help is necessary for the generation of memory CD8 T cells capable of efficient recall responses. 5, 7, 8 CD4 T cells also play a key role in optimal CD8 T-cell expansion in the draining lymph node (LN), subsequent mobilization of activated CD8 T cells into inflamed tissues, as well as their maintenance and survival at effector sites. 1, [9] [10] [11] [12] While imprinting of CD4 T cells on CD8 T-cell function and survival has been extensively studied in peripheral and BALB/c (H-2 d ) mice, which resolves into a persistent infection associated with chronic demyelination. 13 Initial activation of adaptive immunity occurs in the draining cervical LN (CLN). 14 Activated CD4 and CD8 T cells subsequently cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the CNS, where they are re-stimulated to secrete interferon-c (IFN-c), express granzyme B, and lyse virus-infected target cells. 9, 13 CD8 T cells are the major effectors controlling viral load via both IFN-c and perforin-mediated mechanisms. [15] [16] [17] Nevertheless, sustained viral RNA indicates persistence at low levels. 18 The role of CD4 T cells is complex because they not only promote CD8 T-cell function and survival within the CNS 9,10 and directly contribute to viral control, but also enhance pathology. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] A recent study to assess whether CD4 T cells influence CD8 T cells at the activation or effector stage during JHMV infection revealed that CD4 T cells not only enhance CD8 T-cell expansion in the CLN during priming, but also exert helper function within the CNS by locally promoting CD8 T-cell effector function and survival. 9 CD8 T cells were incapable of controlling virus in the CNS without CD4 T cells, even when primed in the presence of CD4 T cells. 9 The latter results were obtained in H-2 b mice, in which the dominant CD8 T-cell response is directed to an epitope in a hypervariable region of the viral spike (S) protein restricted to H-2D b . 24 In the present report, we set out to assess the extent of CD4 T-cell imprinting not only on primary CD8 T-cell responses, but also on memory formation and recall CD8 T-cell responses in the CNS. BALB/c mice were chosen for these studies because they mount a prominent H-2L d restricted CD8 T-cell response to an epitope in the highly conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is expressed at much higher levels than the S protein, 25, 26 potentially leading to distinct T-cell activation requirements. An accelerated CD8 T-cell response to the N relative to S epitope is indicated by earlier detection of N-specific relative to S-specific responses in CLN of infected BALB/c 14 and C57BL/6 9 mice, respectively, as well as an early preponderance of N-specific over S-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS of JHMV-infected (BALB/c 9 C57BL/6) F 1 mice. 26 Moreover, adoptive transfers indicate that virusspecific CD8 T cells induced in the context of H-2 d have more potent antiviral activity than virus-specific CD8 T cells induced in the context of H-2 b . 15, 27 Surprisingly, herein we show that peripheral expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells was not impaired in the absence of CD4 T cells in BALB/c mice, as distinct from C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, CD4 T-cell help during priming was dispensable for CNS accumulation and initial function of primary virus-specific CD8 effector T cells. However, uncontrolled CNS virus replication in the absence of CD4 T cells ultimately resulted in loss of IFNc production, higher CD8 T-cell turnover, and inability to acquire an effector memory phenotype. Nevertheless, the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype was rescued when virus replication was controlled by transfer of memory CD8 T cells, indicating that the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype during primary responses is regulated by antigen load, rather than lack of CD4 T-cell imprinting. By contrast, unhelped memory CD8 T cells mounted poor recall responses when transferred into CD4 T-cell-sufficient mice and could not be sustained in the CNS, despite efficient virus control.",

Clinical disease was scored daily as described elsewhere: 28 0, healthy; 1, ruffled fur and hunched back; 2, hind limb paralysis/ inability to turn to upright position; 3, complete hind limb paralysis and wasting; 4, moribund/dead. CD4 T cells were depleted by intraperitoneal injection with 250 lg purified anti-mouse CD4 mAb (GK1.5; BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) at days \u00c02 and 0 of infection.

However, whereas controls recovered after day 10 postinfection (p.i.) with a survival rate > 90%, CD4-depleted mice exhibited progressively increased clinical symptoms, with mortality beginning at day 25 p.i. and culminating at 100% before day 40 p.i.

Whereas infectious virus in the brain progressively declined to undetectable levels by day 21 p.i. in control mice, CD4depleted mice failed to control infectious virus after day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2c) . These data demonstrated a critical role of CD4 T cells in controlling CNS virus replication at least to day 14 p.i., when viral clearance in both the H-2 b and H-2 d genetic backgrounds is independent of humoral immunity. 29, 30 Consistent with the inability to clear infectious virus from the brain, immunohistochemistry revealed an increased number of virus-infected cells in CD4-depleted mice at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, in the brain many of the virus-infected cells exhibited the morphology of neurons (Fig. 3a, inset) . By contrast, only very rare virus-infected cells were detectable in the brains of con-trol mice at day 21 p.i. Virus-infected cells were also more abundant in spinal cords of CD4-depleted mice compared with controls (Fig. 3b) . In CD4-depleted mice virus-infected cells were predominantly glia in appearance (Fig. 3b , left inset) with occasional infected neurons (Fig. 3b, right inset) . In control mice the spinal cords showed only rare virus-infected cells with the appearance of macrophages (Fig. 3b, inset) . In contrast to the increased number of virus-infected cells and disease severity, overall inflammation in the spinal cord and the extent of demyelination were comparable between the groups (Fig. 3c) .",

In BALB/c mice infected with a lethal JHMV strain, activated CD8 T cells gained access to the CNS independent of CD4 T cells; however, their numbers in the CNS were reduced by~50%. 10 Following sublethal JHMV infection of BALB/ c mice, CD4 T cells were more prevalent than CD8 T cells in the CNS at day 5 p.i. and accumulated to peak numbers by day 7 p.i. (~2\u00c15 9 10 5 ), similar to CD8 T cells (~5 9 10 5 ). 29 To distinguish whether CD4 T cells affected CD8 T-cell recruitment and/or effector function following sublethal infection, CNS accumulation of virusspecific CD8 T cells was monitored. CD4 T-cell depletion did not alter the proportion of virus-specific T cells within the CD8 T-cell population infiltrating the brain or spinal cord (Fig. 4a , data not shown). While the frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells were equally low at day 5 p.i., peak frequencies were reached by day 7 p.i. in both groups. Moreover, the absolute numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells were also similar at all times p.i. (Fig. 4b) , indicating that CD4 T cells were not required for virusspecific CD8 T-cell recruitment or retention. In the spinal cord virus-specific CD8 T cells were also virtually identical throughout infection, irrespective of the presence or absence of CD4 T cells during priming (Fig. 4b) . The failure to clear infectious virus in the absence of CD4 T cells (Fig. 2c ) therefore suggested either that the effector functions of CD8 T cells within the target tissue are impaired, or that CD4 T cells contribute directly to virus control.",

[15] [16] [17] The IFN-c controls virus directly in oligodendrocytes and is also critical to up-regulate MHC class I on oligodendrocytes as well as MHC class II on microglia and macrophages. 17, 31, 32 Perforin-mediated cytolysis specifically controls virus in microglia/macrophages, but not oligodendrocytes. 15 We therefore examined potential defects in effector functions of brain-derived unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells by measurement of ex vivo cytolytic activity and IFN-c expression. Cytolytic capacity of both unhelped and helped CD8 T cells showed no differences between the groups at day 7 p.i. (data not shown). Similarly, CD4 T-cell depletion did not impair the frequency of IFN-c-producing cells in brain-derived CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 5a) . At day 14 p.i. the frequency of IFN-c-producing unhelped CD8 T cells remained similar to day 7 p.i., but was reduced relative to helped CD8 T cells. However, by day 21 p.i. the frequency of IFN-c-producing virus-specific CD8 T cells in the unhelped group declined to < 30%, whereas it was sustained at~45% in controls. In addition to reduced frequencies, the extent of IFN-c production as assessed by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was also lower in the unhelped groups at days 14 and 21 p.i. (Fig. 5a) . In spinal cords the frequencies of IFN-c-producing CD8 T cells were highest at day 7 p.i. and declined in both groups out to day 21 p.i., with no statistically significant differences between both groups (data not shown). Although a trend towards reduced IFN-c secretion on a per cell basis was indicated by reduced MFI in the unhelped CD8 T-cell population, differences were not significant (data not shown). These results suggested that CD4 T cells support sustained IFN-c expression by virusspecific CD8 T cells under conditions of prolonged antigen exposure.",

            "text": "No defects in initial generation and CNS recruitment of IFN-c-producing virus-specific CD8 T cells suggested that the failure to control infectious virus was attributed to inefficient triggering of T-cell effector function in vivo. Interferon-c mRNA expression in the brain was indeed reduced in the CNS of CD4-depleted mice compared with controls (Fig. 5b) . To assess functional IFN-c protein in vivo we further monitored IFN-c dependent up-regulation of CXCL9 mRNA and MHC class II on microglia. Decreased levels of CXCL9 mRNA supported reduced IFN-c activity (Fig. 5b) . Moreover, MHC class II expression was barely detectable on microglia at day 5 p.i. in CD4-depleted mice, but was already up-regulated on 70% of microglia in controls (Fig. 5c) . Although > 98% of microglia in both groups expressed MHC class II by day 7 p.i., overall expression levels assessed by MFI were lower in CD4-depleted mice. CD8 T cells therefore produced sufficient IFN-c in vivo to up-regulate MHC class II on microglia by day 7 p.i. in the absence of CD4 T cells. However, IFN-c levels were insufficient to achieve optimal MHC class II induction, CXCL9 mRNA up-regulation, or Unhelped CD8 T cells do not acquire a memory precursor effector phenotype These data indicated that maintenance of IFN-c-producing CD8 T cells in the CNS appears optimal when CD4 T cells are present during priming and/or the effector phase. Upon activation, CD8 T cells undergo a complex differentiation programme determined by the nature of inflammatory signals. 33, 34 However, two effector cell subsets whose differential expression of the interleukin-7 receptor a chain (CD127) and Killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) is associated with fate determination and development of memory cells are common to many infections or immunizations. Up-regulation of KLRG1 on effector T cells directly coincides with the magnitude of T-bet expression and serves as a marker of terminally differentiated effector cells. 33, 34 By contrast, CD127 is down-regulated upon activation, and activated cells with sustained CD127 expression survive the CD8 contraction phase to form the memory pool. 35 Hence, during differentiation CD8 T cells expressing a CD127 \u00c0 KLRG1 + phenotype are generally considered to be short-lived effector cells (SLEC), whereas a CD127 + KLRG1 \u00c0 phenotype is indicative of long-lived memory precursor effector cells (MPEC). 34 We therefore examined whether the absence of CD4 T cells at priming alters the differentiation phenotype of CNS infiltrated CD8 T cells based on CD127 and KLRG1 expression (Fig. 6a) . Although virus-specific CD8 T cells were low at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 4) , the majority had downregulated CD127 (85% versus 70%, in CD4-depleted versus control mice, respectively; data not shown). However, at this early time, only 15% of virus-specific CD8 T cells had a CD127 \u00c0 KLRG1 + SLEC phenotype in CD4depleted mice, while~30% of helped CD8 T cells displayed this terminal effector phenotype (Fig. 6b) . Although this profile suggested a more activated virusspecific CD8 T-cell population in CD4-sufficient mice, these early differences resolved by day 7 p.i., when the relative populations of SLEC were similar at~17%, irrespective of CD4 T cells (Fig. 6b) . By days 14 and 21 p.i. the proportion of KLRG1 + cells and SLEC within virusspecific CD8 T cells had dropped significantly in both groups, although SLEC continued to be higher in CD4depleted mice (Fig 6b) . CD127 + KLRG1 \u00c0 MPEC were similarly low in both groups at day 5 p.i. and gradually increased throughout infection. However, whereas~70% of helped virus-specific CD8 T cells exhibited an MPEC phenotype by day 21 p.i., this population only reached 30% in CD4-depleted mice (Fig. 6b) . A minor fraction ranging from 5% to 20% of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressed both CD127 and KLRG1 throughout infection in both groups. Whereas this population increased with time p.i. in CD4-depleted mice, it decreased in controls that had cleared virus (Fig. 6b) . CD127 expression on KLRG1 + cells has been observed under conditions of repetitive antigen re-stimulation and may mark long-lived effector memory T cells. 36, 37 Overall, the proportion of KLRG1-expressing JHMV-specific CD8 T cells was relatively low compared with differentiation of SLEC during infection with viruses replicating in non-CNS tissues, e.g. following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection or following malaria parasite immunization. 34, 38, 39 Weak KLRG1 expression may be attributed to the unique CNS environment and/or the redundant role of interleukin-12, a strong inducer of KLRG1, during JHMV infection. 40 Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that early differences in virus-specific CD8 population arise from the absence of CD4 T cells during priming, whereas the significantly reduced efficacy to acquire an MPEC phenotype, coincident with retention of a larger proportion of SLEC, is driven by ongoing viral antigen stimulation. The impaired ability of unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells to acquire an MPEC phenotype, yet the absence of a preferential decline of unhelped relative to helped CD8 T cells, is consistent with the notion that ongoing exposure to viral antigen drives continual renewal. 34, 41 We therefore compared the homeostatic turnover of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS of CD4-depleted and control mice during acute and persistent infection. Consistent with similar numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS, their proliferation was comparable at~85% at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 6c) . The proportions of proliferating virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS gradually declined in both groups starting at day 7 p.i. However, 50% of unhelped CD8 T cells still showed evidence of proliferation at days 14 and 21 p.i., whereas proliferation by helped CD8 T cells had declined to~25% (Fig. 6c) . These data suggest that elevated virus load sustains proliferation, yet also promotes activation-induced cell death. Indeed, while the frequency of apoptotic virus-specific CD8 T cells was similarly high in both groups at day 5 p.i., it remained significantly higher in CD4-depleted mice at day 14 p.i. (Fig. 6c) . Therefore, in the absence of CD4 T cells continued proliferation by virus-specific CD8 T cells was balanced by activation-induced cell death, resulting in comparable total numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS.",

To eliminate the variable effect of viral load in altering CD8 T cells, CD4-depleted infected mice received JHMV-specific memory CD8 T cells to reduce viral load. 15 Memory CD8 T cells were derived from Thy-1.1 mice immunized with JHMV 3-4 weeks post immunization and transferred into JHMV-infected CD4-depleted or control Thy-1.2 recipients at day 5 p.i. This strategy allowed activation of endogenous CD8 T cells and monitoring of both donor and recipient T cells based on the Thy-1 congenic marker. Both CD4-depleted and control recipients developed mild signs of paralysis, and completely recovered from clinical symptoms by day 16 p.i. without mortality (Fig. 7a) . Donor memory CD8 T cells prevented mortality consistent with the inability to recover infectious virus at day 16 p.i. Flow cytometric analysis at day 16 p.i. confirmed essentially equivalent CNS recruitment of total as well as virus-specific Thy-1.1 donor CD8 T cells in both CD4-depleted and control recipients (Fig. 7b,c) . The vast majority of donor CD8 T cells recruited to the CNS were virus specific (60-70%), despite constituting only 2-3% of the donor population before transfer (data not shown). Virus-specific recipient Thy-1.2 CD8 T cells were slightly higher in the brain of CD4-depleted mice (Fig 7d) , whereas those in spinal cord were similar (Fig. 7d , data not shown) confirming that endogenous CD8 T-cell populations were not skewed by the transfer (Fig. 7d) . Importantly, > 60% of virus-specific endogenous CD8 T cells in the CNS of CD4-depleted mice expressed a CD127 + KLRG1 \u00c0 MPEC phenotype at day 16 p.i. (Fig 7e) . The SLEC proportion was reduced to < 2%, showing a similar phenotype distribution as in control mice (Fig. 7e) . The relative MPEC and SLEC populations were also similar in spinal cords in both recipient groups (data not shown). The capacity of endogenous unhelped CD8 T cells to produce IFN-c was also restored to that of helped CD8 T cells (Fig. 7f) . These findings suggest that the altered phenotype of primary CNS CD8 T cells in CD4-depleted mice is mainly driven by sustained viral load, rather than lack of CD4 T-cell help or imprinting.",

To generate unhelped or helped donor memory CD8 T cells, Thy-1.1 mice were either treated with anti-CD4 or control mAb before JHMV immunization. Unhelped or helped memory Thy-1.1 CD8 T cells were transferred into naive Thy-1.2 recipients 1 day before infection. Mice with no donor T cells served as controls. Recipients of helped memory CD8 T cells displayed enhanced virus control at day 5 p.i., but all groups controlled infectious virus by day 14 p.i. (Fig. 8a) . However, in contrast to their helped memory counterparts or primary CD8 T cells (Figs 1 and 4) , unhelped virus-specific memory CD8 T cells were significantly impaired in expansion in the draining CLN, as well as early accumulation in the CNS, (Fig. 8b) . The relative proportion and total numbers of Thy-1.1 + CD8 T cells was significantly lower in the unhelped, relative to helped, donor populations in both CLN as well the CNS at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig 8b,c) . The difference was most apparent at day 5 p.i. in the CNS and was largely resolved by day 14 p.i. Moreover, the number of virusspecific donor CD8 T cells capable of IFN-c production was reduced in both CLN and CNS of recipients of unhelped versus helped memory CD8 T cells at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 8d) . Despite an apparent equilibration towards similar numbers of unhelped versus helped donor CD8 T cells in the CNS by day 14 p.i., survival of the unhelped memory CD8 T cells was profoundly reduced by day 35 p.i. during the chronic phase. Although helped donor Thy-1.1 + CD8 T cells comprised 25% of the total CD8 T-cell population, the proportion of unhelped CD8 T cells had declined > 98% (Fig. 8e) . This vast reduction was also reflected by the total numbers of unhelped versus helped Thy-1.1 + donor cells within the CNS (Fig. 8e) . Unhelped memory cells also failed to survive in the draining CLN (data not shown). Nonetheless, despite their low number, the relative proportion of IFN-c-producing cells was comparable between the groups (Fig. 8f) . These results suggest that CD4 T-cell help at priming plays an essential role in generating long-lasting memory T cells following recall responses within the CNS.",

            "text": "Numerous studies on the role of CD4 T cells in regulation of CD8 T-cell immunity reveal that help for functional primary CD8 T-cell responses is dependent on the pathogen and possibly the target tissue. For example, CD4 T-cell help is dispensable for activation and differentiation of naive CD8 T cells during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 8 during herpes simplex virus infection. 43 Irrespective of the diverse effects of CD4 T-cell help on primary CD8 Tcell responses, memory CD8 T cells generated in the absence of CD4 T cells are typically defective in recall responses. 5, 7, 11 Our studies demonstrate that CD4 T cells differentially influence CD8 T-cell immunity during primary and recall responses mounted to JHMV infection in H-2 d mice and that the necessity of CD4 T-cell help during priming is distinct from infected H-2 b mice. 9 CD8 T cells primed in the absence of CD4 T cells in H-2 d mice had no defects in expansion or IFN-c expression in the periphery similar to vaccinia virus infection of H-2 b mice. 5 Accumulation and subsequent retention of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS also remained unaffected by the absence of CD4 T cells in H-2 d mice. Moreover, cytolytic activity was similar and IFN-c-producing virus-specific CD8 effector cells were equally abundant in the CNS regardless of the presence or absence of CD4 T cells during priming and acute infection. CNS CD8 T cells were nevertheless incapable of reducing infectious virus when primed without CD4 T cells, potentially because of delayed and suboptimal MHC up-regulation in the absence of IFN-cproducing CD4 T cells. A role for CD4 help in maintaining effector function during prolonged antigen exposure was indicated by the decline in both the percentage and i. Density plot shows representative staining of donor Thy-1.1 + CD8 T cells in the brain. Bar graphs represent absolute numbers of helped or unhelped donor Thy-1.1 + CD8 T cells.

Evaluation by analysis of variance showed slightly increased statistical significance for values in (b) for SC and CLN at day 7 and in (d) for CLN at day 5. By contrast, values in (b) for brain at day 14 and CLN at day 7, in (c) for brain and SC at day 5 and CLN at day 14, as well as (d) for brain at day 5 and 14, and SC and CLN at day 7 did not reach statistically significant differences.",

The inability to detect JHMV replication in CLN suggests a minimal influence of virusdriven pro-inflammatory responses, especially as type I IFN induction by JHMV is very low. 44, 45 Differences may rather reside in the magnitude and kinetics of antigen processing or peptide presentation as L d restricted N protein-specific responses appear to arise earlier compared with D b -restricted S protein-specific responses. 26 Moreover, the breadth of CD4 T-cell responses appear to differ, as numerous H-2 b epitopes have been defined, while they appear more limited in H-2 d mice. 46, 47 Irrespectively, uncontrolled viral replication despite intact accumulation of virus-specific CD8 T cells was the consequence of CD4 T-cell depletion in both H-2 b and H-2 d mice; 9,10 while an early defect in CNS CD8 T-cell responses in infected H-2 b mice suggested a local beneficial effect of CD4 T cells on CD8 T cells, 9 a similar but more subtle effect in H-2 d mice cannot be excluded. However, we have been unable to distinguish a direct contribution of CD4 T cells to viral control, e.g. via early IFN-c secretion, from an indirect contribution to CD8 T-cell function involving antigenpresenting cells or soluble mediators. These findings imply that primary CD8 T-cell anti-viral immunity during encephalitis may vary significantly in an outbred population based on provision of CD4 T-cell help at multiple stages and anatomical locations. Nevertheless, irrespective of potentially distinct mechanisms, CD4 T cells appear essential for effective local anti-viral CD8 T-cell function in the CNS.",

Compared with their helped counterparts, JHMV-specific unhelped memory CD8 cells expanded less efficiently in the CLN, were delayed in CNS accumulation, and exhibited reduced survival. A potential mechanism underlying CD4 help is tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL). 48 Since helped CD8 T cells are capable of down-regulating TRAIL expression, they are less vulnerable to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. 49 However, we previously reported that purified CD8 T cells from the CNS of CD4-depleted H-2 b mice had only slightly increased transcript levels of TRAIL mRNA compared with controls. 9 Whether TRAIL expression influences the limited expansion and survival of unhelped memory CD8 T cells in H-2 d mice remains to be examined.",

Infection of oligodendrocytes, the primary targets of JHMV infection, is a prerequisite for demyelination but is insufficient to induce myelin stripping without T cells. 13, 15 In this context it is of interest to note that uncontrolled virus replication during persistence did not exacerbate demyelination in CD4-depleted mice. This contrasts with increased demyelination associated with similarly uncontrolled viral replication in mice deficient in humoral immunity 29 and supports the notion that CD4 T cells promote pathology. 19, 23 Finally, it is interesting to note that uncontrolled viral replication in CD4-depleted H-2 d mice resulted in viral spread to cells with neuronal morphology. While neuronal infection is sparse in immune competent mice, it is clearly evident under conditions of uncontrolled virus replication in infected IFN-a/b receptor-deficient, B-cell deficient, as well as SCID mice, 15, 30, 45 potentially contributing to the lethal phenotype.",

(a) Clinical score of infected CD4-depleted or control recipients. (b-d) At 16 days post-infection, brains were analysed for central nervous system (CNS) virus-specific Thy-1.1 + donor accumulation and recipient CD8 T cells as indicated. Representative density plots gated on total CNS-derived CD8 T cells; numbers indicate relative proportion of Thy-1.1 + donor or Thy-1.1 \u00c0 recipient cells (b) and absolute number of L d /pN tetramer + Thy1.1 + CD8 T cells (c). (d) Representative density plots gated on endogenous Thy-1.1 \u00c0 CD8 T cells; numbers in the upper left corner represent per cent of tetramer + cells among total CD8 T cells and absolute number of L d /pN tetramer + Thy-1.1 \u00c0 CD8 T cells. (e) Recipient virus-specific CD8 T cells were monitored for CD127 and KLRG1 expression to determine CD127 + KLRG1 \u00c0 memory precursor effector cells (MPEC) and CD127 \u00c0 KLRG1 + short-lived effector cells (SLEC) as indicated in Fig. 6. (f) Intracellular interferon-c (IFN-c) production by recipient virus specific CD8 T cells were measured by incubation with pN peptide (1 lM) for 5-6 hr. Symbols represent individual mice. Data represent the mean AE SEM. Statistical significance determined using an unpaired Student's t-test. **P < 0\u00c101. \u00aa 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Immunology, 144, 374-386",
