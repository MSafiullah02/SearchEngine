Much of the morbidity, mortality and health care costs of COPD are attributable to acute exacerbations, the commonest causes of which are respiratory infections. Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in COPD exacerbations but direct proof of a causative relationship has been lacking. We have developed a model of COPD exacerbation using experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients and this has established a causative relationship between virus infection and exacerbations. In addition it has determined some of the molecular mechanisms linking virus infections to COPD exacerbations and identified potential new therapeutic targets. This new data should stimulate research into the role of antiviral agents as potential treatments for COPD exacerbations. Testing of antiviral agents has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model for rhinovirus infection and experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy volunteers has been used to test treatments for the common cold. Experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD subjects offers the prospect of a model that can be used to evaluate the effects of new treatments for virus-induced COPD exacerbations, and provide essential data that can be used in making decisions regarding large scale clinical trials.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as a treatable and preventable disease characterised by progressive air-flow limitation and an enhanced airway inflammatory response (Vestbo et al., 2013) . It is the most common chronic respiratory condition in adults and it is estimated that 65 million people have moderate to severe COPD resulting in 3 million deaths in 2005. COPD develops in response to cumulative exposure to inhaled noxious particles or gases that trigger pathological responses in the lungs that eventually lead to the development of the disease. There are a number of aetiological agents that are associated with the development of COPD. In Western countries the prevalence of COPD is strongly related to cigarette smoking as tobacco smoke is the main aetiological agent. From surveys carried out in developing nations it has become apparent that the relationship between cigarette smoking and COPD is less strong in these countries (Buist et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2005) , and other risk factors contribute to the development of COPD including exposure to burning of biomass fuels, outdoor air pollution and respiratory infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 210, "text": "(Vestbo et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 965, "end": 985, "text": "(Buist et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 986, "end": 1007, "text": "Menezes et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "pathophysiology"}, {"text": "COPD is characterised by a number of pathological changes in the lungs that include parenchymal destruction (emphysema), inflammation of large airways (chronic bronchitis), inflammation and destruction of small airways (bronchiolitis) and mucous hypersecretion (Hogg and Timens, 2009 ).

Studies comparing smokers with and without COPD have demonstrated greater numbers of neutrophils, macrophages and CD8+ T cells in the lungs of COPD patients (Decramer et al., 2012; Di Stefano et al., 1996 . These inflammatory cells release a host of biological mediators including proteases such as neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteases, whilst at the same time the antiprotease defences of the lung are impaired (Pons et al., 2005) . This protease/ antiprotease imbalance results in uninhibited proteolytic activity and destruction of lung parenchyma. High levels of reactive oxygen species are generated in COPD from both exogenous sources (tobacco smoke) and endogenous sources (inflammatory cells). When these overwhelm the lungs' anti-oxidant defences oxidative stress results and induces multiple biological effects including induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, mucous hypersecretion, activation of proteases and damage to cellular components including phospholipids, proteins and nucleic acids (Chiba et al., 2012) .

COPD develops after many years of exposure to the relevant aetiological agent and therefore the current prevalence of COPD reflects exposure to risk factors that has occurred in previous decades. In Western countries the prevalence of COPD is expected to remain stable for some years despite reductions in smoking rates. This reflects previous smoking rates, an ageing population and improvements in therapies for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases that have reduced mortality in COPD (Feenstra et al., 2001) . Much of the increase in the global prevalence of COPD in the future is expected to occur in middle-income countries with large populations such as China, India, Turkey, South Africa and Indonesia. Smoking rates in these countries remain high, and there is also a high burden of other risk factors such as use of biomass fuels, outdoor pollution and respiratory infections.

The occurrence of exacerbations increases with increasing severity of the disease and some patients experience frequent exacerbations . Exacerbations have considerable impact on patients and healthcare providers both during and after the acute episode, and reduction of exacerbations is a key therapeutic goal in COPD.

Therefore prevention of COPD exacerbations is a major therapeutic target and a major unmet need in COPD management. Non-pharmacological treatments for prevention of exacerbations include smoking cessation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and pulmonary rehabilitation. The mainstays of pharmacological therapy are inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Clinical trials have demonstrated that these treatments reduce exacerbations (Calverley et al., 2007; Wedzicha et al., 2008) , although the efficacy of ICS continues to be debated (Barnes, 2010; Suissa and Barnes, 2009 ).

Following on from this small study we repeated the procedure in a larger group of COPD subjects, together with a group of smokers without COPD, in order to further evaluate the safety of rhinovirus infection and to investigate mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations. We again successfully demonstrated that rhinovirus inoculation of COPD subjects induced both colds and increases in lower respiratory symptoms. The time course of upper and lower respiratory symptoms are shown in Fig. 1 . Cold symptoms occurred early peaking on day 3 post-inoculation (Fig. 1A) , whereas lower respiratory symptoms occurred later peaking on day 9, and were more prolonged taking up to 5 weeks to return to baseline levels (Fig. 1B) . This mirrors what COPD patients often report in naturally-occurring exacerbations, i.e. that exacerbations are frequently preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection . The non-COPD subjects also had increases in lower respiratory symptoms but these were not as severe or as prolonged as in the COPD group.

Also it is not known whether exacerbation mechanisms differ according to the aetiology. There may be a common exacerbation inflammatory pathway or the mechanisms may be different with different viruses, bacteria or non-infectious aetiologies such as air pollution.

After uncoating, rhinovirus proteins are synthesized by translation of the viral nucleic acid and the resulting polyprotein is cleaved by viral proteases into 4 structural (VP1-VP4) and 7 non-structural proteins. The viral capsid is composed of 3 outer structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 and an interior protein VP4 that anchors the RNA core to the capsid. A number of molecules have been identified that demonstrate activity against rhinoviruses in vitro however the majority of these molecules have never progressed to use in man.
