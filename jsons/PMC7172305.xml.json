In this series, an overall mortality rate of 75 percent was reported, with 1 of the 3 children with viral infection (all RSV) surviving. In a later series of 60 children with ARDS reported by Davis et al,2 the overall mortality rate was 62 percent. These patients represented 2.7 percent of the admissions to their pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), 8 percent of the total days in the unit, and 33 percent of the PICU deaths during this 2-year study period. The authors reported that, for the group as a whole, the alveolar-arterial oxygenation tension difference (P(A-a)\nO\n2) was the best early predictor of death. In determining mortality by etiology, the authors found that sepsis (n = 22, 37% of patients), including two cases with viremia, was the most common cause. The 12 patients with ARDS secondary to a viral pneumonia represented 9 percent of the total of 135 patients admitted to their PICU with the diagnosis of viral pneumonia during this same period. The mortality rate in the children with a viral etiology for ARDS was 58 percent as compared with less than 1 percent of those with viral pneumonia that did not progress to ARDS. The viruses isolated in patients with ARDS included RSV, influenza, CMV, and measles; the frequency of each reflected its rela-tive frequency in the 135 patients admitted with viral pneumonia.",

He notes that one explanation may be the reciprocal fluctuations in the intensity of epidemics caused by the group of viruses most likely to produce life-threatening respiratory infections in children (eg, RSV, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza 1 and 3) and that the risk of lower respiratory illness in young children remains relatively constant from one year to another.
