The criteria included travelers with acute respiratory symptoms from Hubei province, China or close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 infection. Clinical specimens for testing include nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and stool if diarrhea is present. A minimum of 2 specimens were collected at least 24 hours apart to account for disease progression and to increase yield. [3] The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was confirmed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. A laboratory developed test targeting the N and ORF1ab genes was used at the start of the outbreak in Singapore in late January 2020. From February 6, 2020, a commercial assay was used. The details of the assays are described in the Supplement.",

Patients B and C had persistently negative tests from upper respiratory samples till days 8 and 7 of symptom onset respectively.

These could possibly be due to natural history of disease, intermittent viral shedding, low viral load in upper respiratory tract when the disease is predominantly in the lower tract, and variations in sample collection technique. The virus may be detected in stool samples in 50% of patients with COVID-19 infection.
