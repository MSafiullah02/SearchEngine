Compared to controls, the whole group of FIP-affected cats had blood changes consistent with FIP. Based on the pathological findings or on the immunohistochemical distribution of viral antigen, FIP-affected cats were divided in the following groups: subacute against acute lesions; low against strong intensity of positivity; intracellular against extracellular positivities; positive against negative lymph nodes. Lymphopenia was more evident in cats with acute forms, strong intensity of positivity, extracellular antigen and negative lymph nodes. Cats with positive lymph nodes had the most evident changes in the protein estimations.

The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a mutated form of the enteric one (FECV) (Vennema et al 1995 , Poland et al 1996 . Both these FCoVs are able to pass from the intestine to the blood (Herrewegh et al 1995) ; unlike FECV, FIPV is able to replicate within the macrophages that phagocytose the virus in the lymph nodes and diffuse it through the body (Pedersen 1995a) . The development of the disease depends on the balance between humoral and cellular immunity: antibodies could facilitate the viral uptake by macrophages (Hodatsu et al 1993 , Hodatsu et al 1994 and in the absence of cell-mediated immunity, antigen-antibody complexes are responsible for a type III hypersensitivity reaction that leads to vasculitis and effusion (Hayashi et al 1977 , Pedersen, 1995a . Weak cellular immunity leads to dry forms, characterised by type IV hypersensitivity reactions (Pedersen 1987 , Paltrinieri et al 1998a . In vivo the two types of immune reactions probably coexist (Paltrinieri et al 1998b) . In experimental and in spontaneously occurring FIP, fluctuating levels of circulating antibodies and immune complexes as well as discrepancies between -globulin levels and antibody titre have been reported (Jacobse-Geels et al 1982 , Pedersen 1995a , Paltrinieri et al 1998b . The severity of the disease has been associated with a decrease of circulating lymphocytes (Ward et al 1974 , Pedersen 1995a , Paltrinieri et al 1998b . Furthermore, the distribution and the histological pattern of the lesions, as well as the distribution of viral antigens within the lesions, show great variations among the cats and often among different organs of the same cat (Weiss & Scott 1981 , Walter et al 1989 , Tammer et al 1995 , Kipar et al 1997 , Kipar et al 1998 , Paltrinieri et al 1998a .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 236, "text": "(Vennema et al 1995", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 237, "end": 256, "text": ", Poland et al 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 325, "end": 347, "text": "(Herrewegh et al 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 490, "end": 506, "text": "(Pedersen 1995a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 662, "end": 681, "text": "(Hodatsu et al 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 682, "end": 702, "text": ", Hodatsu et al 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 871, "end": 890, "text": "(Hayashi et al 1977", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 891, "end": 908, "text": ", Pedersen, 1995a", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1020, "text": "(Pedersen 1987", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1046, "text": ", Paltrinieri et al 1998a", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1133, "text": "(Paltrinieri et al 1998b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1367, "text": "(Jacobse-Geels et al 1982", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1384, "text": ", Pedersen 1995a", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1410, "text": ", Paltrinieri et al 1998b", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1520, "text": "(Ward et al 1974", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1537, "text": ", Pedersen 1995a", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1563, "text": ", Paltrinieri et al 1998b", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1812, "text": "(Weiss & Scott 1981", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1832, "text": ", Walter et al 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1852, "text": ", Tammer et al 1995", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1871, "text": ", Kipar et al 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1890, "text": ", Kipar et al 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1916, "text": ", Paltrinieri et al 1998a", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In order to define whether this variability is a casual finding or if it could be associated with different systemic reactive patterns, the relationship between the histological findings and the distribution of the virus on one hand, and haemograms, protein levels and antibody titres on the other were analysed in this study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Fifty-five cats presenting clinical signs of FIP were referred from private clinicians of the area of Milan (Italy).

Although this might be an artifact due to a different distribution of the virus within each lesion, it is most likely due to a different reactivity against the virus, probably related to a different immune status of the cats. Cats with different susceptibility to FCoV infections, due to a breed predisposition, have been already reported . In the present sample the distribution of viral antigen in Persian cats was similar to that of cats from other breeds; however, the hypothesis of an individual predisposition is supported by the finding that cats with more acute lesions and with extracellular antigen, that has been interpreted as the release of virus from lysed cells (Weiss & Scott 1981 , Paltrinieri et al 1998a mainly had negative lymph nodes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 846, "end": 865, "text": "(Weiss & Scott 1981", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 866, "end": 891, "text": ", Paltrinieri et al 1998a", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A further support on the hypothesis of a different reactivity in cats with different immunohistochemical findings, came from the observation that some haematological changes were associated with the increasing spread of viral antigen.

Cats with positive lymph nodes had -globulin levels significantly higher than those of the other group. This suggests that they have already mounted an humoral reaction against the virus. This is consistent with the lower amount of viral antigen found in these cats and it is in agreement with previous reports in which the ability to resist the infection has been associated with a follicular hyperplasia in the lymph nodes (Kipar et al 1999) .
