The successful detection and identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) using this microarray highlighted the potential of the conserved probe design in detecting emerging viruses (Wang et al., 2003). Recently, a panmicrobial microarray (GreeneChipVr) comprising 29,455 60mer oligonucleotide probes for vertebrate viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites has been reported (Palacios et al., 2007). Both of these microarrays used a large number of probes to compensate for the loss of sensitivity and stability from using 60\u201370mer oligonucleotide probes. This redundancy of probes can significantly increase the cost of the microarray.",

Choices were made based on these standards: (i) the official quarantine viruses in China, (ii) viruses infecting a wide range of plants with high economic value and whose infections cause significant economic losses, (iii) viruses not detected previously by microarray. For example, Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) is a member of the genus Comovirus in the family Comoviridae. It is one of the most damaging pathogen of Fabacaeae plants and responsible for severe loss to soybean, kidney bean and cowpea. BPMV may cause up to 85% loss in mixed infection with Soybean mosaic virus (SBMV) (Giesler et al., 2002). BPMV is an important official quarantine virus in China and can be detected by ELISA and RT-PCR (Gu et al., 2002, Joisson et al., 1993), but no microarray-based method has been reported for its detection. Thus Comovirus was studied in this investigation.",

Since the positive strand RNA of ssRNA negative strand viruses exist in the host total RNA, the positive strand sequences of these viruses were used to design probes. The full-length genome sequences were used to design conserved probes for all genera except the genus Capillovirus. As the number of full-length genomic sequences for this genus was less than 5 in the database, partial genomic nucleotide sequences were included to determine the conserved probes. A total of 286 viral sequences representing 169 virus species of 13 viral genera were used to design the conserved probes.

Seventy nucleotide segments offset by 5 nt were selected from the highest conserved regions. The 70mers were filtered by (i) GC content between 40% and 60%, (ii) <5 continuous mononucleotides (PolyX), and (iii) <8 nt inner hairpin. The 70mers were then aligned to the viral sequences in the virus genus, and the off-target database by pair-wise BLASTN. It has been reported previously that 70mers with \u226585% similarity and \u226515 nt continuous base pairing with the target sequence are sufficient to generate a detectable signal (He et al., 2005). Thus these cutoffs were set as the threshold in the probe-viral sequence pairing. The off-target probe pairing was set as \u226425 nt base pairing with the other viruses or plant mRNA sequences.

One probe was added to the seed each time to maximize the coverage of the genus. The search was finished when all the viral sequences in the genus were covered by the probes, or the size of the set reached 15. The seed searching was repeated three times so that most viruses in the genus were detected by three probes.

These viruses were inoculated mechanically into herbaceous host plants. After disease symptoms appeared, infected leaves were collected. The viruses were verified using ELISA and PCR. ELISA was performed by using a commercial kit from ADI, San Antonio, USA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the reactions were completed, OD405 of each sample was determined in a micotiter plate reader MULTISKAN ASCENT (THERMO, Vantaa, Finland). ELISA readings were considered positive when the absorbance of the sample wells was at least twofold greater than the mean absorbance of the three healthy controls. For the infected Panax notoginseng sample, a universal monoclonal antibody was used in ELISA to detect potyviruses. Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by using a commercial kit from TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan, and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. BPMV primers were from (Gu et al., 2002). Different PCR primers were designed for the other viruses in the conserved regions of these viruses using Primer 3 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000) (Table 3\n).

A sequence of 1866 nucleotides excluding the polyA tail at the 3\u2032-terminal region of the genome was determined using 3\u2032-RACE amplification. The sequence included the 3\u2032-terminal part of the NIb, the coat protein, the stop codon and the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) (Fig. 5\n). Several features in the sequence revealed that the virus is a species of the genus Potyvirus as indicated by the cleavage site of the NIb protein and the presence of a potyvirus-like coat protein. The RdRp active site of the NIb protein was SGQPSTVVDNTLMVVIAMTYALLKMGFPAEQHDEVCQYFVNGDD. The 3\u2032-UTR sequence had high AT content, and included inverted repetitive sequences \u201cGAGGN/N\u2032CCTC\u201d. According to a BLAST homology search to the NCBI database, the closest virus to the unknown potyvirus was an unclassified virus identified in P. notoginseng in 2006, sharing 98% identity at the protein level and 92% identity at the nucleotide level. The other close virus species were Angelica virus Y, Carrot virus Y, Celery mosaic virus and Apium virus Y.",

Therefore, by generating a minimal number of three probes targeting each virus genus, we aimed to achieve a consistent detection result while reducing the redundancy of the probes.

The level of microarray sensitivity was roughly equivalent to TAS-ELISA, 10-fold higher than conventional ELISA, although still much lower than PCR. Agindotan and Perry (2007) had PLRV being detected in RNA dilution of 1:100 using their nylon membrane based macroarray. As shown in their report, this sensitivity is comparable to DAS-ELISA.

For the P. notoginseng samples showing disease symptoms, while the traditional serotype based method, ELISA, failed to detect any virus, the microarray identified the unknown virus as a species of the genus Potyvirus. None of the closest viruses, e.g. the unclassified viruses identified in P. notoginseng, Angelica virus Y, and Carrot virus Y, had published genomic sequences. Thus no sequence from these viruses was used to design the conserved probes for the genus Potyvirus in the microarray. It suggests that the detection microarray system does not need prior knowledge of newly emerged viruses, thus it will not be limited by selection of specific primer sequences (i.e. PCR) or antibodies (i.e. ELISA). This test highlights the potential use of the microarray in detecting newly emerging plant viruses. This is similar to the detection of SARS as a novel coronavirus using the ViroChip prior to the sequencing of the SARS genome sequence (Wang et al., 2003).",
