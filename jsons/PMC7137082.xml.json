No vaccine has been launched yet. The source of H7N9 human infections is unclear, but based on past experience and epidemiological investigation, H7N9 virus might be carried by poultry, in their secretions or excretions. About 40% of the patients have not been in contact with poultry before. China's official media, quoting Gregory Hartl (a WHO spokeperson), stated that although transmission of H7N9 virus between human beings has not been reported yet, there is a risk that mutations in the virus could ease the spread. Moreover, men who are smokers are a susceptible group because of their pulmonary dysfunction associated with smoking.3\n",

Patients usually present with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, and cough with little phlegm, which can be accompanied by headache, muscle aches, and general malaise. Patients with severe progression of the disease manifest severe pneumonia, with body temperature over 39\u00b0C and difficulty breathing. The disease can progress rapidly, accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome, mediastinal emphysema, septic shock, disturbance of consciousness, and acute kidney injury.",

Shanghai, Nanjing, and some other places have suspended live poultry transactions and prohibited the entry of exotic live poultry. However, it is still a great challenge for the Chinese Government to control the infection. Unlike the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic 10 years ago, H7N9 virus does not show signs of human-to-human transmission, and isolation of patients would not limit the transmission. Immediate culling of infected poultry is an effective measure. But more efforts must be made to prevent further spread of the infection.",
