            "text": "Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak presents a significant threat to global health. A better understanding of patient clinical profiles is essential to drive efficient and timely health service strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for a higher susceptibility to symptomatic presentation with COVID-19 and a transition to severe disease. Methods We analysed data on 2756 patients admitted to Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1 st January and 23rd April 2020. We compared differences in characteristics between patients designated positive for COVID-19 and patients designated negative on hospitalisation and derived a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19, we used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with progression to severe disease defined by: 1) admission to the hospital's AICU, 2) the need for mechanical ventilation, 3) in-hospital mortality, and 4) at least one measurement of elevated Ddimer (\u22651,000 \u03bcg/L) indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Results The patient population consisted of 1148 COVID-19 positive and 1608 COVID-19 negative patients. Age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, respiratory rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure formed the most parsimonious model for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19 at hospital admission. Among 1148 patients with COVID-19, 116 (10.1%) were admitted to the AICU, 71 (6.2%) required mechanical ventilation, 368 (32.1%) had at least one record of D-dimer levels \u22651,000 \u03bcg/L, and 118 patients died. In the multivariable logistic regression, age (OR = 0.953 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.937-0.968) C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007), and white blood cell counts (OR = 1.059 per 10 9 /L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) were found to be associated with admission to the AICU. Age (OR = 0.973 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.955-0.990), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol/L, 0.868-0.962) were associated with mechanical ventilation. Age (OR = 1.023 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.004-1.043), CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006), and body temperature (OR = 0.723 per 1 o C, 95% CI: 0.541-0.958) were associated with elevated D-dimer. For mortality, we observed associations with age (OR = 1.060 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.040-1.082), female sex (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.245-0.777), Asian ethnic background (OR All rights reserved.

Conclusion Our analysis suggests there are several demographic, clinical and laboratory findings associated with a symptomatic presentation of COVID-19. Moreover, significant associations between patient deterioration were found with age, sex and specific blood markers, chiefly C-reactive protein, and could help early identification of patients at risk of poorer prognosis. Further work is required to clarify the extent to which our observations are relevant beyond current settings.",

It is estimated that approximately 81% of all COVID-19 patients develop uncomplicated or mild disease, while 14% develop severe illness, and 5% require treatment in a hospital adult intensive care unit (AICU) (1, 2) . Risk factors for inferior prognoses are critical to identify, in order to facilitate informed decision-making on prevention measures and patient care by policy makers, epidemiologists, and clinicians.",

These include C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTpro BNP), liver function biomarkers alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST), and numbers of lymphocytes circulating in the blood (3, 6, 7) .

Variables included in the model were selected by backwards elimination using the Bayesian Information Criterion (12, 13), a likelihood measure which penalises model complexity to prevent overfitting. We then conducted internal validation of the model with both 10-fold cross validation in the sample of patients in which the model was developed, as well as with an internal-external validation approach in those patients for whom COVID-19 status had not initially been confirmed (coded as \"suspected\" in earlier revisions of the data) but then transitioned to known COVID-19 status at a later stage in their hospital admission period following receipt of a valid test result.

Our results demonstrate that higher levels of CRP increased the risk of all outcomes, indicating that virally driven hyperinflammation may play a key role in driving inferior prognoses (6, 21, 22) . Moreover, D-dimer \u22651,000 \u03bcg/L was associated with increased risk of AICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Elevated D-dimer can be indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as of indicative of other conditions such as inflammation, sepsis, and infection, and has been more recently associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients (23, 24) . However, its lack of association with mortality warrants further investigation. Analyses also showed that older age and increased levels of sodium are inversely associated with both admission to AICU and mechanical ventilation. Although these findings have not yet been independently corroborated by other studies in this area, researchers have recently postulated that high dietary sodium may downregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, by which SARS-CoV is known to infect host cells (25) . This hypothesis may help to explain the inverse associations seen in our study, but further investigations are required, particularly in light of the fact that increased risk of mortality was observed in patients with higher serum levels of sodium. Interestingly, while older age was protective for admission to the AICU and mechanical ventilation, it was also associated with greater risk of mortality. Risk of mortality was further elevated in males, those of Asian ethnic background, and those with a higher respiratory rate at admission to the hospital.",

Hence, it is possible that patients without COVID-19 for whom these measurements were recorded had worse health states or inferior prognoses, thus resulting in more conservative estimates of associations in our analyses when comparing differences in characteristics with patients with and without COVID-19. Similar concerns extend to our analysis of AICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and elevated D-dimer. In restricting analyses to patients with complete data, we may have included patients systemically different from the remaining population, as well as constrained analyses by reducing statistical power. However, many associations were biologically plausible and remained statistically significant following adjustment of P-value significance thresholds with the Holm-Bonferroni correction method, which adds weight to the validity of our findings. We must also acknowledge the likelihood of residual confounding in this study, as there were many risk factors, including but not limited to smoking, body-mass index, and medical history, that we were not able to adjust for in analyses.",

Among biomarkers, the odds of admission to AICU were higher in those with higher serum concentrations of CRP (OR = 1.006 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.004-1.008), higher haemoglobin (OR = 1.017 per 1 g/L, 95% CI: 1.006-1.029), greater absolute numbers of red blood cells (RBCs; OR = 1.696 per 10 12 /L, 95% CI: 1.249-2.322), and greater absolute numbers of white blood cells (OR = 1.044 per 10 9 /L, 95% CI: 1.009-1.080). Lower odds of admission to the AICU was observed for higher serum levels of sodium (OR = 0.949 per 1 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.911-0.987). For vital signs, both higher body temperature (OR = 1.303 per 1 o C, 95% CI: 1.082-1.595) and higher respiratory rate (OR = 1.025 per 1 breath/min, 95% CI: 1.001-1.049) were associated with increased odds of AICU admission. A total of 628 patients with complete data and 112 cases of admission to the AICU, were used to develop the multivariable logistic regression model. Following multivariable-adjustment, most associations were attenuated, with only increases in serum levels of CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007) and numbers of white blood cells (OR = 1.059 per 10 9 /L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) associated with greater odds of admission to the AICU (Figure 2).

On mutual adjustment in the multivariable model, our results showed that associations of mechanical ventilation with both CRP (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium levels (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol/L, 0.868-0.962) remained significant (Figure 2).

The EHR data collected during patients' hospitalisation period included biochemistry test results, vital sign measurements, and data recorded in the AICU for any patients with severe disease manifestations admitted to the unit for more aggressive therapy (Figure 1). Information on previously recorded diagnoses and inhospital administered medication was also available. Prior diagnoses were coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10). All analyses were restricted to patients aged 16 years or older at the time of their most recent hospital admission (assumed to be the 'target' admission at which there were concerns of COVID-19). Patients with incomplete or missing data for risk factors of interest identified through a review of published literature (SupplementaryTable 1) were excluded from baseline comparisons and regression analyses.",

No significant differences were observed for history of previously administered medication classes (as defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) pharmaceutical reference book for medications available on the UK NHS) (Supplementary Table 1). Multiple laboratory measurements obtained at the time of hospitalisation showed statistically significant differences between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patient groups (Supplementary Table 1).
