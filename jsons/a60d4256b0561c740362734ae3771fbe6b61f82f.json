Sometimes, the very same donor required data in more than one format, depending on the year the project was approved. The forms demanded by the Chinese government were different again. \"It was driving everyone crazy\", remarked NCAIDS Director Zunyou Wu. It is entirely understandable that funders should want to know how the money they provide is being spent. Rigorous monitoring of what a programme spends and what it achieves is necessary to make sure that programmes are being run efficiently; reporting achievements also helps increase public support for continued funding. But people running HIV programmes shouldn't have to spend more time and funds monitoring what they do than doing it.",

            "text": "In 2006, NCAIDS decided that everyone would benefit from a single, integrated data platform designed primarily to meet national needs. The first order of business was to decide which data would be included. It was a mammoth task. Two senior staff worked full time collecting and reviewing all of the monitoring and evaluation forms and standardised indicators used for data collection and reporting by government agencies and by foreign-funded projects. They then held a series of consultations and workshops to agree on a single set of indicators and reporting forms. The process took two full years and entailed a lot of argument. \"Some of the foreign projects, they complained a lot. Each donor lobbied to have their own indicators, complaining that they would not be able to show accountability\", recalled Zunyou Wu. \"We said to them: you are supporting China; that means you need to support our national needs. If you don't want to support our integrated system, then you can just quit\". The NCAIDS director chuckled. \"No one quit. Donors can be very strong-minded. But we are even stronger minded\". China was also in a relatively strong position because by the time the system was launched in 2008, the Chinese government already provided the majority of funding for HIV prevention and care in the country. \"It's harder for other countries to do, because they have to respect their donors' requirements\". The system, known as Comprehensive Response Information Management System (CRIMS), provides a single, web-based portal which allows programme managers to see what is going on in the national epidemic in real time. It provides simple web-based data entry forms which minimise data management requirements and provides standardised statistical reports which allow for at-a-glance analysis of trends. The platform was developed by a private contractor at the cost of some CNY400,000 (around US$55,000); maintenance costs about the same again each year. Highly secure, it allows data for everyone diagnosed as HIV positive in China to be entered at patient level, including their CD4 test results and treatment status. Patients on methadone can also be tracked at the individual level. Other data such as use of prevention services are reported in aggregate by site.",

In the first example, the system was used to spot an unrecognised area of very high prevalence. Data from a voluntary HIV testing site in Liangshan Prefecture in the south-western province of Sichuan reported that over a third of all clients were testing positive. In the old reporting system, staff in Beijing would probably have assumed a typo, or an error in transcription as the data got sent through paper records and by e-mail from testing site to county office, from county to prefecture and on up through the chain. In the new system, there is little room for such errors. CRIMS allowed staff in Beijing easily to check other data from the same site (data that would previously have been in a different database held by a different division). Sure enough, the data for HIV prevalence among women in the same county who were routinely tested during pregnancy were also very high, between 2.6 and 5.1% at different sites, compared with a national average of just 0.2%. China CDC staff in Beijing then contacted local staff to organise a population-based survey. They tested some 31,100 villagers in one county, an area with a large ethnic minority population, and found that 7.0% of general public aged 15-60 were living with HIV. Much of the infection was linked to drug injection. The central and provincial governments quickly committed extra manpower and funds to help the remote prefecture step up prevention and cope with high levels of infection. Furthermore, Premier Wen Jiabao spent World AIDS Day 2010 in Liangshan.",

This was perhaps the case in the second example of the early use of CRIMS, this time to spot problems with the treatment programme. The province of Guangxi, bordering Vietnam, has a busy sex trade and a fair number of heroin users; it was one of the earliest provinces to develop an indigenous HIV epidemic driven by risk behaviour, and by the time the CRIMS became active, many people in Guangxi needed treatment. Staff in Beijing had for some time been under the impression that Guangxi was rolling out their treatment programme quite effectively. \"But then we looked at the data pulled together in CRIMS and we saw that they had unexpectedly high mortality. The CD4 data suggested the epidemic was really horrible, and so many people were dying without ever getting any treatment\", said Zunyou Wu. \"They had the highest case fatality in the country\". Staff from Beijing went to discuss their observations with provincial officials. \"When we showed them the data their faces just went ashen\". The exchange led to a huge leap in political commitment from provincial leaders and thus in resources. Guangxi is now the only province in China which has a deputy director in the health bureau dedicated entirely to responding to HIV.",

In a quick analysis which calculated average consumption per client and compared averages across clinics, the data from a single site in the southern province of Guangdong leapt out at CDC staff. The clinic was consistently consuming much more methadone than was justified by its client load. A site visit and investigation quickly established that clinic staff had been illegally selling methadone on the black market.

We would address issues as they came up, and made plans as we went along\". That has changed. \"Now we have a stronger infrastructure and better regulatory controls\".

China has been winning battles one by one: first, infections through poor blood donation practices were virtually eradicated. Then, effective prevention among drug injectors brought the rate of new HIV infections in that group right down. Condom promotion and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers prevented the virus from ever taking off in commercial sex in China. Most recently, treatment services have been extended to most of the people that need them. Inevitably, the spotlight now turns to the challenges that remain.",

Some find it frustrating that these biomedical successes have not, by themselves, been enough to shut down the epidemic. Guohui Wu, the microbiologist who now heads the AIDS division in Chongqing CDC, expressed this disappointment: \"With other outbreaks, I can isolate the bacteria, use the right antibiotics, and a week later the epidemic is controlled and there is a great sense of accomplishment in my heart. But with HIV/AIDS, we work very hard, but still we keep discovering new infections. This perplexes me: why is there still so much infection?. . . Do people not know they are at risk? They do know, so how with that knowledge do they still get infected?\" This frustration sometimes takes a personal toll: \"When I look at old photographs, when I was a manager in the microbiology department and had less stress, I had a lot more hair!\", the doctor said ruefully.",

I asked each and every one of them about what they reported when they got diagnosed, and not one of them, when they did their first epidemiological intake form, 'fessed up' to being gay.

Two factors in particular mean that the shape of the HIV epidemic among gay men in this country will look different to that in the West. The first is technology. As Xiping Huan suggested, social networking apps have changed the face of sexual risk, not just in China but the world over. Apps such as Grindr and Hornet allow men in many countries to find potential sex partners without having to go to a bar where they might be seen by a family member or work colleague, without having to suffer the sometimes excruciating embarrassment of the face-to-face meeting. In 2015, Grindr had some six million monthly users worldwide, including in China. BlueD, founded by former policeman Le Geng, has 27 million registered users, mostly in China, at least two million of whom are actively looking for dates on any given day. Technology has allowed more men, including those who may be wary of going to gay venues, to meet one another and thus to find sex partners. But it has simultaneously made it harder to reach those men with the sort of face-to-face interaction that created a sense of shared responsibility in the early years of the community response to HIV in Western countries.",

When AIDS invaded the gay bars of San Francisco, Sydney, London and Amsterdam, it was a visible and terrible syndrome that led to a rapid and often painful death. By the time Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao and Chengdu had active gay scenes, AIDS was practically a thing of the past. HIV, of course, is very much alive and spreading rapidly. But most gay men in China have probably never seen a person with symptomatic AIDS. The fear factor that comes from seeing your friends and loved ones die is simply no longer there. This is of course a very good thing. But it does mean that it is harder to convince people of the need to take measures to protect themselves from the virus. This new reality has not been well understood by Chinese health authorities; they continue to speak of the importance of \"awareness\", as though gay men would change their behaviour if only they were more aware of HIV and knew how to prevent it. But new cases of HIV infection are on the rise in gay communities worldwide, even in countries where prevention knowledge is 100%. Although the Chinese language makes no distinction between HIV and AIDS in daily speech, the fact is that the two are not synonymous. Treatment has broken the inevitable progression from invisible HIV infection to visible illness (symptomatic AIDS) to death. Treatable HIV infection simply doesn't elicit the same kind of community response as AIDS once did, and no amount of \"awareness raising\" will change that.",

The PrEP study was a typically bold experiment on China's part; though very effective as a prevention method, it has proven politically controversial in many countries. For example, in early 2016, the politically conservative government in the United Kingdom was still not providing PrEP to gay men at risk for HIV, despite a good evidence base and very strong demand from the gay community. In China, the opposite problem arose: though the government offered PrEP, gay men were not willing to take it -perhaps a throwback to the days when the quality of antiretroviral drugs in China was poor and side effects common. In a feasibility study in three eastern provinces, only 197 out of 1033 uninfected gay men surveyed said they would be willing to take the medicine to protect themselves from HIV, and only 26 men -just 2.5% of the study population -actually took it. A rather higher proportion of men said they would be willing to be circumcised to prevent catching HIV, but only 3% actually showed up for their appointments and underwent the procedure.",

From the start of the epidemic to 2009, China received over US$526 million from some 40 foreign agencies and foundations. The money was spent on 276 separate projects; though all were implemented in partnership with Chinese authorities, many were driven by the priorities and interests of the international partners. Even after China began firmly to set its own national priorities with the \"Four Frees and One Care\" commitment of 2004, funding for implementation was often provided by foreign sources. The first large-scale treatment services for people infected while selling plasma were mainly paid for by the Global Fund, for example. But as those services rolled out in provinces most affected by poor plasma collection practices, the government realised that it could not neglect other populations. It began to fund large-scale testing and provision of treatment to other populations out of the national budget. Details of China's spending on HIV are shown in Fig. 10 .8 of the Chap. 10 . From an initial contribution of CNY100 million in 2001, spending increased astronomically to reach CNY3.7 billion by 2015. As the proportion of HIV-related funding coming out of national pockets grew, so did the government's desire to reduce the fragmentation that comes of having so many different foreign partners funding so many different projects.",
