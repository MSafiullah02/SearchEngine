However, reports aimed at identifying the relationship between pandemics and child health are limited. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003 and its relationship to child development indicators using a representative sample across China. Our study involved longitudinal measurements of 14,647 children, 36% of whom (n = 5216) were born before or during the SARS pandemic. Cox models were utilized to examine the effects of SARS on preterm birth and four milestones of development: age to (1) walk independently, (2) say a complete sentence, (3) count from 0 to 10, and (4) undress him/herself for urination. Mixed effect models were utilized to associate SARS with birthweight, body weight and height. Our results show that experiencing SARS during early childhood was significantly associated with delayed milestones, with adjusted hazard ratios of 3.17 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.71, 3.70], 3.98 (3.50, 4.53), 4.96 (4.48, 5.49), or 5.57 (5.00, 6.20) for walking independently, saying a complete sentence, counting from 0 to 10, and undressing him/herself for urination, respectively. Experiencing SARS was also associated with reduced body weight. This effect was strongest for preschool children [a weight reduction of 4.86 (0.36, 9.35) kg, 5.48 (-0.56, 11.53) kg or 5.09 (-2.12, 12.30) kg for 2, 3, 4",

Using a well-designed multi-stage sampling approach 13 , children (0 -15 years old) who were born before and after the SARS pandemic (November 2002 -May 2003 were surveyed in 2010, 2011, 2012 and every two years thereafter. Baseline samples were collected from the 25 most populous provinces and included both SARS hotspots (Beijing municipality and Guangdong Province) and non-hotspots (e.g., Heilongjiang Province). Experienced interviewers collected demographic information, birth records, physiological development and cognitive development data using a computer-assisted questionnaire. The study has been approved by the institutional review board at Peking University (Approval IRB00001052-14010) . In this study, we focused on two indicators of child development: (1) longitudinally-reported body weight and height; and (2) time (in months) to reach a developmental milestone 14 , including (a) walking independently, (b) saying a complete sentence, (c) counting from 1 to 10, and (d) undressing him/herself for urination. We also considered newborn health indicators of gestational length and birthweight both as potential cofounders for the child development and outcome variables. We obtained all records of 14,754 children from CFPS 2010-2016. We excluded six subjects with ambiguous age or those \u2265 16 years old, and 101 subjects with invalid data for any of the eight study outcomes.

According to the fully-adjusted models (Table 2) , exposure to SARS during early childhood was associated with delayed time to walking independently, saying a complete sentence, counting from 1 to 10, and undressing for urination, with the HR of 3.17 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.71, 3.70), 3.98 (3.50, 4.53), 4.96 (4.48, 5.49), or 5.57 (5.00, 6.20) , respectively.

The home-confinement orders increase the prevalence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors (e.g., watching TV), which are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, and mental disorders in young people 21 . Second, the pandemic reshapes the living environment of children by keeping them indoors and reducing exposure to the natural environment. According to the biophilia hypothesis 22 , affiliation with nature promotes child developmental psychology 23 . For instance, residential green space has been associated with beneficial effects on cognitive development and brain function in school-aged children 24,25 . Finally, the pandemic is associated with both short-and long-term socioeconomic impacts. During the outbreak, reduced availability of medical services (e.g., prenatal and postnatal care), school closures, and feelings of panic spread via social media may adversely affect child health. After the pandemic, socioeconomic challenges such as increased unemployment can also impair child health. Although many underlying channels can explain negative associations between pandemic exposure and child health, the contributions of different pathways to the epidemiological linkage are unknown.",

Prolonged use of masks can also result in discomfort 17 and physiological changes 18 , which, for vulnerable individuals, may be particularly harmful. Isolation of children due to infection or exposure may separate children and their caregivers or peers and alter an important learning context for development.

To limit SARS transmission, a series of social-distancing policies were implemented. In Beijing, strict quarantine, closing of facilities (e.g., shops and schools) and body temperature surveillance were implemented11 . In the present study, we defined the pandemic period as November 2002 -May 2003, and the disease hotspots as Beijing and Guangdong 15 (according to the birth province of each child). We assumed that all residents were influenced by the social-distancing policies and that those from hotspot areas experienced greater impacts.
