However, should the US public wear isolation masks when in crowded indoor or public areas to prevent the spread of the virus? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the use of cloth face coverings for the public on April 3, 2020, especially in areas of high community transmission [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO)'s updated interim guidance on April 6, 2020 does not make this recommendation [2] . In this perspective, we briefly review the current scientific evidence behind universal public masking based on 4 considerations: (1) the highly contagious nature of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19; (2) increasing evidence of viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals; (3) experience from Asian countries with receding epidemics that incorporated universal masking as a part of stringent public health measures; and (4) the potential contribution of masking to facilitate selective return-to-work policies CONTAGIOUSNESS OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2",

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread exponentially worldwide since the cluster of infections in Wuhan Province was first reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019 [10] . As of this writing, worldwide estimates of COVID-19 cases exceed 1.8 million, a number that is likely grossly underestimated due to inadequate testing capability in many settings. Although the airborne versus droplet question is relevant to healthcare settings (which involve close contact) and has guided infection control recommendations and type of masks required accordingly [7, 10] , the most compelling reason for public masking is due to the data on spread from asymptomatic individuals [11] . For the general public, surgical isolation masks (as part of an overall public health strategy) should be able to curb dissemination of both droplet-spread and airborne viruses to the breathing zones of nearby individuals [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

A study detailing the clinical and virological characteristics of 5 patients in France showed that 2 patients had high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal secretions soon after symptom onset [28] . Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads than those in upper respiratory samples during the phase of active pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome with SARS-CoV-2 [29] . However, high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract samples among patients \"without symptoms\" suggest a high risk of transmissibility [30] . Modeling studies have also demonstrated that paucisymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for a large proportion of transmissions [31, 32] , with early case reports and familial clusters also indicating asymptomatic transmission [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In sum, the degree of transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals in SARS-CoV-2 is the most compelling argument for universal public masking.",

Asian countries were heavily impacted by SARS-CoV-1 [8] , which may have led to a more rapid institution of universal masking for SARS-CoV-2 [47] . In the early stages of the epidemic, Taiwan immediately increased its capacity to mass produce surgical isolation masks for HCWs and the public [28] , and they announced plans on April 1, 2020 to donate 10 million masks to countries most severely impacted by the coronavirus.",

The CDC has provided guidance on which cloth materials are the most effective for preventing the spread of respiratory droplets [12, 49] , although ensuring that equality to access is imperative and recommendations on how to prolong the life of disposable masks and reuse masks are widespread [50] . Another major concern is that the public will let their \"guard down\" with masking [2] . This can be addressed with strong public health messaging performed in tandem with new policy.",

When social distancing is not possible, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control has mandated that members of the public wear face masks, including on public transportation where fines may be incurred for noncompliance. The country of Taiwan remains one of the most controlled in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic to date, with 388 cases and 6 deaths as of April 12, 2020 [51] . An eventual and cautious recommendation for a return to work in the United States, with public masks for crowded indoor or outdoor spaces as one component of the updated guidelines, could provide much-needed relief for the economy. Tips for how children can be encouraged to wear face masks are already emerging [52] .",
