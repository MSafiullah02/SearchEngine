When I think of fairness, I am thinking of investing in equitable access to prevention, mitigation, and treatment for COVID. That includes looking out for the most vulnerable populations and their needs for basic things, including clean water. When we say prevention is easy, that we should wash our hands for 20 seconds, it is easy to forget that a large proportion of the population in the U.S., if not the world, does not have access to clean water, or the Internet access to learn about best practices or threats to our food supply, but even more importantly, in order to assure that we try to protect our frontline workers, personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain, investing in vaccines, or even investing in evidence-based treatments. So for me, the number one answer has to focus on promoting equity for all the reasons Dr. Elk just described. Right now, we are seeing that a disproportionate number of people who are suffering and dying from COVID-19 are black and brown folks. We can dig deeper into why that is when we get to the other questions, but it really draws attention to the inequity in our society that allows us to continue to oppress populations that are already at risk for all aspects of inequity.",

I feel pandemics have this very strong way of showing us how widespread social and health inequalities are, and how in the day-to-day they prevent people not only from protecting themselves, but also from leading healthy and productive lives. Within the realm of vulnerable and marginalized populations, there are three main groups that come to mind as examples. First, there are children who live in poverty who may not be directly affected by the serious health consequences of COVID-19, but in many cases depend on being in school for their only meals. The pandemic has shown that in addition to school-based nutrition, we need to think of additional systems to deliver child nutrition to the 20 + million children who live in poverty in the United States, especially in communities of color that have been marginalized and discriminated against for centuries, and experience high rates of poverty. The Family First Coronavirus Act has tried to address these issues, but it is just a drop in the bucket compared to the needs we are facing. 1 The second group is the homeless population. We talk about social distancing and washing hands. These are very difficult behaviors for people who live in shelters or in the street. We have seen communities coming together and trying to install temporary sinks. But again, we need more comprehensive interventions.",

My focus has been on mental health issues and how patients and families might feel abandoned, as well as how poor communication and lack of resources to attend to psychosocial needs are often overlooked in life-threatening illness, especially for marginalized patient populations and families. I look more at the intersection of how psychosocial influences might be affected and impact access to care, receipt of care, feelings of injustice that some people might have gotten a ventilator whereas other people may have been denied a ventilator. We are trying to leverage the available resources that we know exist to try to remove barriers to better care for everyone, but by targeting a lot of the psychosocial issues that we think really account for who gets what.",

By ''communication,'' I am referring to barriers to effective communication to decision-making, to getting care, to receiving care, to working with families at home to connecting families with work and employment.

Some of the main principles of communication, and especially risk communication, are trust, transparency, and community engagement. A lot of communication has not been meeting these principles because it has been conflicting. It has not included community leaders who actually have the real understanding of the communities for which this communication is intended, who are trusted sources. Often these are the individuals who really know best about the needs, preferences, and priorities of specific communities, such as communities of color, children, and other populations. We need really to think of risk communication not as the rem-edy when things go wrong, but something we should be prepared for in advance, during inter-pandemic times.",

In our studies, what we have found is that for whatever reason -we do not know the mechanisms -but when very sick, dying patients seek a hospital chaplain, they are more likely to sign a do not resuscitate order. They are less likely to die in an ICU. They are more likely to enroll earlier in hospice. We have been trying to understand this, but we suspect it has to do with feelings of trust that may lead to an enhanced ability to communicate. Leveraging the power and influence that healthcare chaplains have in this crisis might be effective.

I am expendable. I can clean. I can pick in the fields for your food, but I am not going to have time off, and if I am a casualty of this pandemic, well, then, you do not really care. Somehow I am supposed to continue to be engaged, maybe vote, and to be part of this process. How does it make sense when it seems that you all do not really care about me?'' And so I think that there is a component that we have to reach to address that legitimate disenfranchisement as well as figure out through culturally competent sort of communication about how can they have some agency in this, how do they recruit help for when their loved one is sick, identify who were all the individuals that need to be in the loop on that conversation?
