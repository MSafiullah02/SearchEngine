Thus, Canada's First Ministers 1 have agreed to invest Canadian $1.1 billion in the Canada Health Infoway to promote and facilitate the development of interoperable EHR and telehealth solutions. With this investment, along with investments by organizations, the provinces/territories, and previous federal initiatives, their goal is to have the basic elements of interoperable EHR solutions in place in half of all Canadian jurisdictions by 2010. This is a tall order, and gives rise to a series of questions: Can it be done? How will it be done? Why now? What is different from before? The answer is convergence.",

The second is a password-protected Internet web site that allows healthcare providers to access healthcare information generated by various individuals and contained on the network. The third component, a system that allows healthcare providers to access a health record spanning across many institutions, is critical to integrating a patient's EHR across various systems. Called HiNet, this system makes information such as laboratory results, x-rays, visit information, doctor's notes, and personal information available electronically to healthcare providers when needed (Electronic Child Health Network 2001).",

About six months later, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that required an immediate operation at The Toronto Hospital for Sick Children (HSC). Originally, Jason was a patient at Toronto's St. Joseph's Health Centre (SJHC), where he was under the care of Dr. Mark Feldman, the hospital's Pediatrician-in-Chief. Dr. Feldman referred Jason to the specialists at HSC. At that time, Jason's mother had to go to St. Joseph's Health Centre to pick up Jason's health records, including his diagnostic images and charts, and personally delivered them to HSC. Now: Dr. Feldman explains that \"Jason is a kid whom I follow at SJHC with regard to epilepsy and school problems and was followed at HSC for cancer. Epilepsy drugs and cancer drugs may interact-I knew exactly what he was on. If the parents had questions about his cancer treatments, I could answer some of them. If HSC had questions about his epilepsy treatment-they could get the info immediately. If he presented to either ER with symptoms related to his cancer or its treatment, his epilepsy or its treatment or unrelated problems requiring a treating MD to know his history in detail-HiNet made this possible.\" Jason's mother, Ms. Gibson, explains that another reason she was happy to give consent to having Jason's health records included in HiNet is for future reference. \"If he is ever taken to an Emergency Room, whether he is conscious or unconscious, I want somebody there to know what that big scar (53 stitches) is all about. I want them to know that his epilepsy is gone. I want them to be able to get on with trying to figure out what may be wrong with him at that time, rather than trying to figure out what his history might be. That part is known and it's all there for them to see.\" (Electronic Child Health Network 2004).",

Their response was that the information model encompasses more than just data; it is an object-based model that uses modern object-oriented techniques, resulting in more easily adaptable systems. Adaptability is key, because changes to traditional EHR models are expensive and difficult to implement. Thus, participants suggested overlaying the two models. The information model needs to accurately reflect the functional model, and vice versa. The information model needs to cover all necessary data for every decision that might be made in the functional model. Each new element (information or function) in one model must be validated against the other. Elements from the two models can be mapped using a matrix structure, making the two models somewhat self-validating. As one model changes, so does the other.",

These initiatives are listed in Table 15 .2. 1. Development of standards is driven primarily by the business of health care and must meet a clearly defined business need. 2. Standards development will be project based, with standards tested, refined, and evaluated as integral components of projects. This ensures a vital connection between the business need and the imperative to standardize, and facilitates re-use in successive projects. 3. The development, implementation, and maintenance of standards must be coordinated at a pan-Canadian level, and success will demand strong leadership coupled with broad support from all stakeholders. 4. Adoption and use of standards will succeed only if promoted by compelling incentives. 5. Efforts to develop and implement standards must focus on those standards that can be best sustained over the long term. 6. Two key components for successful standards implementation are management of change and the transition from current state to desired state. Tools and processes must accompany implementation, so as to minimize any negative impact while maximizing every opportunity for success. 7. Existing work will be leveraged wherever possible and practical. The process must always first encourage adoption, or adaptation, of existing standards, before development of new standards is considered. Additionally, development of new standards will be done through participation with and sponsorship of existing standards development organizations. 8. Standardized methodologies and tools will be a key consideration for any standards development model or process. 9. Vendors will be actively involved throughout the establishment of standards. 10. Provincial standards councils must play an integral coordination and communication role between various jurisdictions and pan-Canadian standards processes. 11. A commitment to building capability and capacity for standards work must be a key consideration in any standards development model or process. Stakeholders will need constant and ongoing education about standards initiatives and how they should be engaged. 12. Jurisdictions must be prepared to provide the leadership and resources needed to establish and implement standards. 13. Canada should increase its commitment to playing a leadership role in international standards. While developing pan-Canadian EHR standards represents an ambitious goal, it is also necessary to ensure that standards are harmonized with similar initiatives internationally. Canada's participation in international development activities will directly enhance efforts to adopt national standards. At a minimum we will be aware of international standards initiatives and participate and influence those that are relevant to Canada's needs. 14. Electronic health record standards development must be coordinated on a pan-Canadian basis. A clear stakeholder engagement strategy will be needed to foster appropriate representation in every aspect of development. 15. Alignment with standards, and with standards-development initiatives, will be key considerations in guiding Infoway's investment decisions for new projects. Project development lifecycles and standards lifecycles should be specifically coordinated. 16. Incentives will be available to existing projects to encourage alignment with standards or standardsdevelopment initiatives. In some instances, current projects will be mandated (and funded) to comply with the emerging standards vision. 17. Where applicable, Infoway projects will incorporate a standards component and will contribute to the evolution of a robust set of pan-Canadian standards for the EHR. 18.

To this end, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Model Code is used extensively to formulate privacy legislation in Canada at the provincial and federal levels. By design, a successful pan-Canadian EHR will contain information that can be, when required, shared across organizations and jurisdictions in a controlled manner. Because of differing provincial legislation, however, there is no uniform process across the country to support the sharing of electronic health record data. \"The issues that revolve around privacy and security do not pertain to the technologies and processes required to implement them, they pertain to the absence or lack of normalization of policies, laws, rules and regulations around privacy and security\" (Canada Health Infoway 2003b).
