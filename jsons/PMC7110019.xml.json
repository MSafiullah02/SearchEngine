Kogan et al showed that almost 40% of preschool children received OTC cold medications within the previous month, the majority of which were antihistamine/decongestant combinations1. Several studies of combined antihistamine/decongestant preparations have failed to demonstrate any effect on symptoms of the common cold in the preschool age group, although their sedative effect may be perceived as desirable by parents coping with a young child with a common cold2. First generation antihistamines alone have shown favourable effects upon nasal symptoms in adult studies, but this has not been replicated in children. Nasal decongestants improve cold symptoms in adults and increase nasal patency in children, but their potential side-effects such as rebound obstruction and nasal epithelial drying mean that they are not recommended in children3. The use of such medications should be questioned as they appear to offer no protection against the development of otitis media, side-effects are not uncommon and accidental ingestion can occur.",

Antibiotic use is potentially harmful causing a significant increase in side-effects and, by increasing colonisation with resistant organisms, with the risk that any subsequent invasive infection will be unresponsive to standard antibiotic regimens5. Several cross-sectional studies have shown the likelihood of culturing a resistant strain of Pneumococcus from the nasopharynx is increased if a patient has recently completed a course of antibiotics5. Mucopurulent rhinitis frequently accompanies the common cold and may persist for at least 2 weeks, but is unaffected by antibiotics6. Despite these consistent findings, up to 44% of children with common cold symptoms are given antimicrobial agents accounting for 6.5 million prescriptions annually in the US7. Characteristics of parents who request antibiotics for their child's cold symptoms are that they are more likely to report severe symptoms, to believe that symptomatic therapy helps cold symptoms, or to be confident that they knew how to treat a cold. Such beliefs may be amenable to parent education in order to reduce antibiotic use in primary care where opportunities also exist to discuss prevention, including immunisation against influenza and the avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke8.",

Whereas cough has previously been under-recognised as a symptom of asthma, asthma in children is increasingly now diagnosed on the basis of cough in the absence of wheeze, and this has contributed to the recently observed increased prevalence of asthma. Such observations are based on adult data suggesting that individuals with asthma may present with cough alone19, while in hospital-based studies, cough has been reported to be the commonest presenting feature of asthma in children20. There are a number of difficulties inherent in using the symptom of cough as an outcome measure in epidemiological studies of respiratory illness in children. The repeatability of reporting of cough is poor, and several studies demonstrate that parental reports of cough frequency in their child, particularly nocturnal cough, are inaccurate when compared to objective measures12. While night cough in children disturbs their parent's sleep, it seems to cause little reduction in quality of children's sleep22. Similarly, the use of diary cards to report nocturnal cough frequency are inaccurate21.",

Airways resistance measured by the interrupter technique in preschool children did not differ significantly between coughers and control subjects27 (Fig. 1), while Brooke and colleagues demonstrated that 56% of children identified as having recurrent cough in the pre-school period were symptom-free at follow-up after 2\u20134 years with 37% reporting continued cough. Importantly, while 7% of children with recurrent cough reported wheeze at follow-up, a similar proportion to a previously symptom-free control group also reported symptoms suggesting asthma28. Therefore, previous clinical studies of children with persistent cough which have suggested that a significant number progress to develop asthma, who have not included an asymptomatic group, may have incorrectly assumed that such children represent cough-variant asthma29.\n",

Short-course, high-dose, inhaled steroids may be indicated in some children with persistent nocturnal cough. Davies et al demonstrated that while children with persistent cough improve in 2 weeks on placebo, 17 of 24 subjects on inhaled corticosteroid and 8 of 23 on placebo improved objective measures of cough frequency by 75% indicating modest benefit33. Previous studies on cough and asthma suggest that cough associated with asthma should significantly reduce within 1 week of commencing treatment20,31, while suggestions that inhaled steroids should be used for prolonged periods in cough are anecdotal.

Therefore, some children without diagnosed asthma may present with cough as a consequence of heightened CRS, but do not have evidence of airway obstruction. A subset of these children may also have increased AHR while coughing20, but are no more likely to respond to inhaled bronchodilator or corticosteroid treatment than children without AHR19,21.

Most will have a viral aetiology, particularly in children under the age of 3 years; it is, therefore, not rational to treat all acute sore throats with antibiotics40,44. It has been suggested that the rationale for antibiotic treatment of sore throat is based upon the premise that prompt elimination of GABHS is effective in preventing acute rheumatic fever and in addition will prevent suppurative complications, lead to more rapid resolution of symptoms and prevent spread of infection. While outbreaks of rheumatic fever have been reported in children in the US, the incidence is extremely low in the UK and there is no evidence to support routine antibiotic treatment of acute sore throat to prevent rheumatic fever or to prevent suppurative complications40. Penicillin has been shown to have a significant, though relatively small, benefit in providing symptomatic improvement in children with severe symptoms of sore throat, but is not recommended for routine symptomatic relief in all cases of acute childhood sore throat35,36. Routine use of antibiotics enhances patient belief in antibiotics and increases re-attendance for future minor and self-limiting illness44,45.",

While a 10-day course of oral penicillin V given 4 times daily is regarded as standard treatment40, several studies have demonstrated a superior effect in eradicating GABHS using a cephalosporin, macrolides or clindamycin35. Advantages of such antibiotics include the use of a shorter course and a more convenient once or twice daily dose schedule, although this needs to be weighed against the increased cost of such antibiotics and the risk of development of GABHS resistance40.",

If a child with confirmed sore throats due to tonsillitis differentiated from generalised pharyngitis on the basis of history and clinical examination, experiences 6\u20137 recurrences over 1\u20132 years despite antibiotic treatment, and symptoms are causing significant morbidity, tonsillectomy should be considered35,36,47.

Breast-feeding appears to reduce OM incidence in several studies with a recent meta-analysis reporting a 13% reduction in OM for exclusive breast-feeding lasting for 3\u20136 months50. However, some studies have failed to control adequately for exposure to cigarette smoke and social class, which are both associated with increased OM incidence. While breast-feeding confers immunological benefits including the reduction of infant nasopharyngeal colonisation with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the presence of breast milk pneumococcal antibodies, these findings are not correlated with the prevention of OM. An alternative explanation for the benefit of breast-feeding in reducing OM incidence may be a mechanical one. It is known that supine bottle feeding is associated with reflux of milk into the middle ear and increased incidence of abnormal tympanograms when compared to upright feeding. Further support to the contribution of mechanical factors in accounting for differing OM prevalence is suggested by a study reporting a 33% lower incidence in OM in infant who did not use a pacifier after the age of 6 months51.",

There is now convincing evidence that respiratory viruses play a significant role in the development of this condition (Table 2)54,55. While earlier studies using viral culture or rapid antigen detection methods identified virus infection in 30\u201350% of nasopharyngeal specimens from children with OM, the development of polymerase chain reaction methodology has increased the detection rate to between 42\u201390%56. Several studies have documented viruses in middle ear fluid of children with AOM including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and parainfluenza, rhinovirus and, less commonly, adenovirus. RSV appears to be the principal agent invading the middle ear, occurring in the middle ear fluid of 74% of children infected by this virus57. Therefore, viral vaccines become potentially important in the prevention of OM in children. The use of inactivated influenza vaccine or live-attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine reduced the incidence of OM by 36% of children, but its benefit is confined to the peak influenza season58,59. The aim of RSV vaccine is to prevent lower respiratory tract illness in infants, but it could also, potentially, have a major effect on the incidence of OM in young children58.\n",

Antibiotics appear to play only a small role in resolving symptoms of AOM and their use is associated with increasing resistance in Strep. pneumoniae and H. influenzae61. A recent Cochrane Review, which included 2202 children, showed only limited benefit of antibiotics in AOM with 17 children needing to be treated to prevent one child experiencing some pain after 2 days62. There was no effect of antibiotics on complications or recurrence of AOM62. Antibiotic use in acute OM appeared to confer no significant improvement in the prevalence of hearing deficit or on recurrence rates of acute OM in a recent meta-analysis, but may have been insufficiently powered to demonstrate clinically significant outcomes62\u201364. The majority of cases of acute OM resolve spontaneously; however, where antibiotics are prescribed in populations thought to be at increased risk of complications, amoxycillin remains the drug of choice65. Uncomplicated AOM may be treated with a shortened 5\u20137 day antibiotic course, a practice supported by a number of randomised controlled trials66, although short-course therapy may not be appropriate for young children less than 2 years who are at higher risk of treatment failure67. It has been suggested that children under 2 years of age, who are at particular risk of poor outcome from AOM, may be a group who would benefit from aggressive antibiotic treatment. However, current high prescription rates of antibiotics to treat AOM in this age group are not supported by a recent study by Damoiseaux et al, who demonstrated that, while after 4 days of treatment, antibiotics led to resolution of more symptoms, there were no differences between treatment and placebo groups at 11 days and prevalence of middle ear effusion at 6 weeks68,69.",

These data, together with concerns about increasing pneumococcal resistance, have resulted in a need for the more judicious use of antibiotics in recurrent OM, perhaps confined to infants under 2 years of age and those attending out-of-home child-care. Ventilation tube placement (tympanostomy) reduces the frequency of OM episodes in children with a history of recurrent OM and may be a valid alternative to prophylactic antibiotic therapy or failed prophylaxis, particularly for children with language delay or hearing deficit71.",

In a US study, the vaccine was 7%, 9% and 20% effective in preventing clinically diagnosed AOM episodes, recurrent OM and ventilation tube placement, respectively76.

Although efficacy was 56\u201357% for culture-confirmed vaccine type AOM and 25\u201334% for all culture-confirmed pneumococcal AOM, effects on clinically diagnosed AOM was either similar or showed a 6% decrease in AOM for vaccine and control groups.
