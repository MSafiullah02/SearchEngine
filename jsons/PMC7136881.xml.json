A recent systematic review revealed how early tracheostomy, performed in the first 7 days after orotracheal intubation, is associated with a reduction of mechanical ventilation duration, mortality rate and length of stay in ICU [4]. Despite surgical tracheostomies being routinely performed in the surgeon\u2019s daily practice, the surgeon\u2019s risk of exposure to COVID-19 during this procedure is consistent. Due to the direct access to the airway and the mechanical ventilation, which generates a huge amount of droplets in case of air-leakage from the cuff, tracheostomies place surgeons to be the highest risk category, together with ICU nurses and doctors. Surgical tracheostomy on sedated and intubated patient is, by far, preferable than awake patient tracheostomy or percutaneous cricothyrotomy for which air-flow cessation cannot be obtained and droplets emission is inevitably higher.",
