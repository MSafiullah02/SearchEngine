However, unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 480 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences from the 1575 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available and identified 37 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif as hotspots for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly, two of the 37 substitutions occur within highly conserved secondary structures in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions that are critical for the virus life cycle. Furthermore, clustering analysis revealed unique geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile. Of note, we observed several co-occurring mutations that almost never occur individually. We define 3 mutually exclusive lineages (A1, B1 and C1) of SARS-CoV-2 which account for about three quarters of the genomes analysed. We identify lineage-defining leading mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which precede the occurrence of sub-lineage defining trailing mutations. The identification of mutually exclusive lineage-defining mutations with geographically restricted patterns of distribution has potential implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design. Our work provides novel insights on the temporal evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",

This is far more alarming than the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2003 which affected 26 countries, killed 774 people, but was contained within 6 months (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2003_09_23/en/). Understanding the unique features of the SARS-CoV-2 is key to containing the COVID-19 pandemic (Wu et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 are closely related RNA viruses with plus strand RNA genomes. RNA viruses usually display high mutation rates that facilitate adaptability and virulence (Sanjuan et al., 2010) . The moderate mutation rates seen in SARS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2004) have been attributed to the presence of a 3'-5' exonuclease or proof-reading like activity (Minskaia et al., 2006) .",

While several studies have used phylogenetic analysis to reveal mutation hotspots in the viral genome and identify variants (Forster et al., 2020; Koyama et al., 2020; Yeh and Contreras, 2020) , we have utilized an alternative approach by focusing only on mutations present in >1% genomes followed by clustering.

            "text": "To understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the first three months of the pandemic, we performed a detailed analysis of full-length genomes available from the GISAID database from December 24, 2019 to March 24, 2020. A total of 1575 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were retrieved from GISAID (as on 24 th March 2020). Sorting for full-length genomes resulted in a dataset of 481 sequences including the RefSeq sequence. A multiple sequence alignment was performed to visualize the variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. To analyse the single nucleotide substitutions in detail, we decided to focus on those which were observed in >1% of the genomes. As expected, the 5' and 3' ends of the sequences contained gaps and inconclusive nucleotide positions (Ns) attributable at least in part to the technical shortcomings of sequencing. The substitutions in the 3' and 5' UTRs were considered only when the quality of the sequences in the area is greater than 95%. Our analysis revealed a total of 37 nucleotide substitutions which occurred at > 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Table 1 and Figure 1A ). This includes 13 synonymous mutations, 21 missense mutations and 3 substitutions in the non-coding regions. ORF9/N gene encoding for the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein seems to have accumulated the maximum number (n=6) of mutations. This is also evident when substitution frequencies for each gene are normalized for the gene length ( Figure 1B ). Among the non-structural proteins (Nsps), the viral RNA polymerase-helicase pair (nsp12/13) accumulated seven mutations. These observations are important considering that the widely used diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 target nsp12 and N genes. While, we found 5 mutations in the Nsp3 region, the substitution frequencies per unit length are rather low as Nsp3 is the longest among the non-structural genes. It is interesting to note than no mutations were observed in the Nsp5 region coding for the main protease (Mpro), a widely investigated anti-viral target for SARS-CoV-2 (Jin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . A quick scan along the 30kb genome of SARS-CoV-2 clearly suggests clustering of mutations at the 3' end of the genome (Figure 1 ). It would be worth investigating differences if any, in the fidelity of the virus polymerase or exonuclease pertaining to the 3' end of the genome. All subsequent analysis presented in this study pertain to the 37 mutations occurring at >1% frequency. ",

These mutations may have implications on viral RNA folding. Group I and II coronaviruses harbour three sub-structural hairpins SL5a, SL5b & SL5c with conserved hexameric \"UUYCGU\" loop motifs, which when present in multiple copies are presumed to act as packaging signals for viral encapsidation (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) . Similar structures have been predicted in the 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (Andrews et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020) . The C241T mutation changes the C-residue in the hexameric loop motif of SARS-CoV-2 SL5b (Supplementary Figure S1A & S1B). This is one of the earliest and the most prevalent (34.8%) of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations and may impact viral packaging and titres.",

The predominance of C to T (U) substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 has been documented recently (Koyama et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Amongst host RNA editing enzymes, APOBECs (Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex) and ADARs (Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA) have been studied for their ability to edit virus genomes (Cheng et al., 2019; Piontkivska et al., 2017) . Both negative-strand intermediates and genomic RNA (positive sense) may be available as ssRNA inside coronavirus infected host cells. The negative-strand intermediates serve as templates for the synthesis of the positive strand (genomic RNA) as well as the sub-genomic transcripts. In this process the negative-strand intermediates will progressively lose the ssRNA conformation and gain dsRNA conformation. In essence, both ssRNA and dsRNA forms will be available for RNA editing by host enzymes. This is important considering that RNA editing APOBECs specifically act on ssRNA to induce C>U transitions and ADARs target dsRNA resulting in A>I (inosine; read as G) editing. APOBEC-mediated editing of the genomic RNA (positive strand) will result in C to U changes, while the editing of the negative-strand intermediates (C to U) will result in G to A changes in the genomic RNA (positive strand). It is well documented that the abundance of the positive sense RNA outnumbers that of the negative strand RNA in infected host cell (Sethna et al., 1991) . Our finding of predominance of C to T (C to U) mutations (38.9%) over G to A mutations (19.4%) is consistent with the abundance of genomic RNA (positive sense) over the negative-strand intermediates.",

The predominance of APOBEC-like RNA editing (i.e C to U and G to A) over ADAR-like RNA editing (i.e. A to G and U to C) in SARS-CoV-2 may be explained at least in part by the transient nature of virus dsRNA available inside infected host cells.

            "text": "We also analysed the dinucleotide context of the mutations described. For this purpose, we considered nucleotides flanking the substitutions described in table 1. For example, a C>T mutation in the trinucleotide sequence 5`-ACG-3` sequence will result in 5`-ATG-3` trinucleotide. In this context an AC and a CG dinucleotide are lost and an AT and a TG dinucleotide are gained. In other words, each substitution will lead to a loss of 2 dinucleotides and a gain of 2 dinucleotides. We analysed the 36 substitutions (G29742A/T was excluded) to assess the net loss or gain for each of the 16 dinucleotides. Interestingly, the 36 substitutions were associated with a loss of 10 GG dinucleotides and a gain of 13 TT dinucleotides ( Figure 2C ). The dinucleotides lost or gained are influenced not only by the nature of the substitutions (eg. C to T or G to A) but also by the nucleotides flanking the substitution site. Furthermore, dinucleotides provide important clues about virus pathogenesis (Sankar et al., 2018; Wasson et al., 2017) . In particular, CpG dinucleotides have been associated with virus replication, immune response and virus pathogenesis (Fros et al., 2017; Simmonds et al., 2015) . A recent paper suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is extremely CpG depleted to avoid host defences (Xia, 2020) . Virus evolution has been also linked to variations in other dinucleotides including TpA and GpT (Simmonds et al., 2013; Upadhyay et al., 2013) . Previous reports suggest that coronaviruses have excess of TT dinucleotides and are depleted for GG dinucleotides (Cheng et al., 2013) ; this is consistent with major dinucleotide gain/loss in SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Figure 2C ) The biological implications of these findings remain to be determined.",

We then analysed the frequency of TTT trinucleotides upstream of these 3826 positions. The TTT trinucleotide frequency immediately upstream of substitutions originating at C/Gs is significantly higher than that upstream of randomly generated nucleotide positions (26.7 % vs 3.6 %; p<0.00001; Figure 2F ).

In contrast to this approach, we utilized our catalogued set of 38 single nucleotide substitutions (36 substitutions + G29742T and G29742A) to understand the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. A clustering analysis was performed to systematically group all 480 full-length genomes into subtypes which are defined by the set of mutations they harbor. After removing groups which consisted of <5 genomes, the analysis revealed 24 distinct clusters ( Figure 3A ). This analysis identified very interesting geographical distribution of the clusters across the globe ( Figure 3B ). For example, cluster-1 (T28144C, C8782T, C18060T, A17858G, C17747T) accounted for more than 15% of the genomes analysed and was almost exclusively reported from North America (NA). A similar pattern was observed for cluster 16, which was also restricted to NA. Several clusters including cluster -2, -3, -5, -13, -18, -19, -20 and -23 were unique to the European countries (EU). A large number of EU specific clusters could be partially due to the over representation of genomic sequences from EU (196 out of 480).",

We define co-occurring mutations as those which occur together in >90% of their individual occurrences. For example, if mutation A occurs 50 times and mutation B occurs 51 times in the dataset and mutations A and B are present together in the same genomes (i.e. co-occur) 50 times, they are defined as co-occurring mutations as 50/51 is >90%. Accumulation of mutations is key to the diversification of viral lineages. In addition, the co-occurrence of mutations in virus genomes is often suggestive of compensatory mutations. Individual mutations as well as co-occurring mutations can act as lineage defining mutations. We consider a specific mutation or a set of cooccurring mutations as \"lineage-defining\" for SARS-CoV-2, only when they are present in at least 5% (n=24) of the sequences analysed. Each lineage-defining mutation(s) are mutually exclusive and are not present along with another lineage-defining mutation. Our analyses reveal three mutually exclusive lineages for SARS-CoV-2. We refer to these three lineages as A1, B1 and C1 in the chronological order of their appearance (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 3 . The A1 lineage (co-occurrence of C8782T, T28144C) appeared as early as 5 th January 2020 in Asia. The presence of G26144T defines our B1 lineage. This mutation was first observed in samples collected from North America on 22 nd January 2020.

In other words, trailing mutations never occur in the absence of leading mutations. The lineage-defining mutations A1, B1 and C1 represent leading mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The chronology of the first appearance of all the 37 substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is summarised in Supplementary table 1. The A1 lineage accumulates two independent trailing mutation sets giving rise to A2 (A1+T4402C, G5062T) and A3 (A1+ C17747T, A17858G, C18060T) variants of SARS-CoV-2. While A2 was reported from South Korea by the end of January, A3 first appeared on 20 th February 2020 from the USA and accounts for >15% of the 480 genomes. The B1 lineage acquired a trailing synonymous mutation in the Nsp13 helicase (T17247C) to give rise to the B2 sub-lineage (B1+ T17247C) reported from South America in the end of February, 2020.

The mutations which show significant change in their frequency over the first three months of SARS-CoV-2 evolution are shown in Figure 5 . The data is filtered for mutations which appeared in >5% of the sequences in at least one of the datasets. Interesting patterns emerge for different mutations spread over the four datasets ( Figure 5) . Interestingly, the frequency of the lineage-defining A1 mutation increases to about one third of the sequences in the second dataset, but plateau from the second to fourth dataset. This would mean that the A1 lineage is consistently contributing to about a third of all newly reported sequences. The C1 lineage profile follows a logarithmic rise between the 3 rd and 4 th datasets. The first case of this leading mutation appeared on the 20 th of February and by the 18 th of March it was among the most frequent mutations (164 out of 480; >34%). Consistent with the appearance of the trailing mutations later in the timeline, trailing mutations for A3 (denoted as A3'), C2 (C2'), C3 (C3') and C5 (C5') sharply increase in numbers between the third and fourth dataset. The G11083T variant displays a profile similar to A1, despite with much lower prevalence and plateauing at approximately 12%. C14805T (Nsp12/RNA polymerase synonymous) is another mutation which also show an upward tendency reaching 5.9% in the fourth dataset.",

Clustering analysis revealed unique geographic distributions of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile.

The 5` UTR stem-loop structures were predicted using the Forna server (Kerpedjiev et al., 2015) ( http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/forna/). The PDB structure for s2m stem-loop motif from SARS-CoV was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb)(PDB ID: 1XJR) and was visualized using UCSF Chimera software (version 1.14) (Pettersen et al., 2004) . Figure 5. SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequencies over the first 3 months of the pandemic. We compared the percentage fraction of high frequency mutations (>5% in at least one dataset) in four sequential datasets consisting of 51, 172, 214 and 481 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (including the reference genome sequence). A. Some mutations including the A1 and C1 leading mutations appear very early in the virus evolution and are present in over 60% of the sequences in the most recent dataset. The trailing mutations of A3, C2, C3, C5 are denoted as A3', C2', C3', C5' respectively and these do not include their leading mutations. For example, A3' consists of A3 defining mutations alone and does not include its leading mutation set A1. A3', C2', C3' and C5' as well as the C14805T and G11083T mutations are increasing in frequency over time. B. C29095T and C21707T (<1% in the 481 sequence dataset, hence not described earlier in the manuscript) substitutions rapidly declined with time. The B1 leading mutation shows significant presence in all the four datasets. ",
