            "text": "Reservoirs of infection can be ecologically complicated structures comprising one or more interacting populations or species (Box 1\n[5]). Although a range of developments has led to better theoretical conceptualisation of reservoirs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, their empirical characterisation remains a challenge. In this article, we review methods currently used to characterise each of the components that comprise a reservoir according to the framework in Box 1. Specifically, we first present a conceptual approach for classifying patterns of incidence and prevalence (see Glossary) that result from the connectivity between source and target populations (black arrows in Figure I in Box 1). We then review methods that allow us to identify maintenance or nonmaintenance populations (squares or circles in Figure I, Box 1), how they are connected (arrows in Figure I, Box 1), and the role that each of these populations has in maintaining the pathogen (i.e., reservoir capacity).Box 1Disease reservoirs frameworkOur study of epidemiology is usually motivated by the need to control disease in a particular host population or a subset of a population. Following Haydon et al.\n[5], we refer to this as the \u2018target population\u2019. Populations that are direct sources of infection for the target are termed \u2018source populations\u2019. A \u2018reservoir of infection\u2019 is defined with respect to a target population as \u2018one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which a pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the target population\u2019 [5]. Some reservoirs can be simple and comprise a single nontarget host population (Figure I\nA). However, they can comprise a more structured set of connected host subpopulations termed \u2018maintenance community\u2019 (Figure IB\u2013D). Individually, some of these populations can maintain the pathogen (\u2018maintenance populations\u2019), whereas others cannot (\u2018nonmaintenance populations\u2019).Thus, infection reservoirs can be constituted in a variety of ways. Reservoirs can be wildlife species [e.g., possums (Eichosurus vulpecula) as a reservoir of bovine TB in cattle in New Zealand; or wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a reservoir of malignant catarrh fever for cattle in Tanzania]; domesticated species (e.g., dogs as a reservoir of rabies for humans in many developing countries; cattle as a reservoir of Escherichia coli 0157 for humans in the UK), or subsets of the same species (e.g., adults as a reservoir of respiratory syncytial virus for children, men as an element of the reservoir of human papillomavirus for women).Other definitions of reservoirs have been proposed 7, 55. Although Ashford's [7] definition is appealing for its generality, and Drexler et al.\u2019s\n[55] for its evolutionary perspective, we use Haydon et al.\u2019s\n[5] due to not only its acceptance within the epidemiological literature, but also its direct application for designing interventions.",

Here, we further discuss how to enrich this evidence base. Almost inevitably, the need to intervene will precede adequate understanding of the dynamics of reservoir-target systems. Our central thesis is that interventions that are meticulously planned to optimise both the immediate short-term benefits to the target population and the longer-term understanding of how reservoirs function, applied together with a formal integration of data and methods [13], can provide powerful new opportunities for studying complex multihost systems (e.g., [14]).",

            "text": "Given the challenges of isolating pathogens from wildlife populations, patterns of incidence and prevalence are typically obtained from longitudinal seroprevalence surveys or age-seroprevalence curves. These have been used to investigate infection dynamics of various multihost systems, such as canine distemper virus (CDV) in carnivore communities of the Serengeti 18, 19, Kenya [20], and Yellowstone [21], Trypanosoma cruzi in wildlife hosts in the USA [22] and hepatitis E in wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Europe [23]. However, their interpretation remains fraught with uncertainties mainly owing to cross-reactivity, declining antibody titres, cut-off thresholds used to distinguish positive and negative reactions, and difficulties with the detectability of antibodies because these depend on the relation between immunity and infection resistance (e.g., a detectable antibody does not always imply protection and the time of exposure remains unknown for pathogens that create life-long immunity in the host) [24]. New statistical approaches, such as latent class methods and site-occupancy modelling, have been suggested recently to improve estimates of prevalence from imperfect tests by allowing uncertainty in the detection of infection state [25]. Although still in early stages of development, advanced modelling techniques, such as Bayesian process models, can enable inferences of timing of exposure from age-seroprevalence data, accounting for non-stationary epidemiological dynamics [26], and/or detect cross-species transmission [27], to identify which host species is the most likely source of infection.",

Given that persistence is sensitive to the complex relation between demographic and epidemiological factors, it is difficult to estimate in the presence of population structure 30, 31; therefore, CCS is most commonly discussed in the context of single well-mixed populations, although these are rare in natural systems. The second challenge is in defining persistence, particularly because any estimate of CCS is likely to be sensitive to the choice of persistence metric [32]. In his original work, Bartlett defined CCS as the size of a population in which extinction was as likely as not following a major outbreak [29]. However, persistence might also be measured from an initial condition corresponding to the endemic equilibrium 33, 34. Lloyd-Smith et al.\n[35] point out that the relation between persistence and population size is not well described as a step function, but instead increases in a gradual manner. CCS can also be thought of in relation to the probability of extinction within a given time or the time until a given proportion (usually 50%) of introductions (or simulations) have gone extinct [36]. Once appropriate definitions are adopted, the final challenge is estimating CCS. The main approaches used are: (i) empirical observation, which consist of plotting incidence data against population size 28, 37, 38, 39; (ii) analytic expressions 34, 40, 41, 42, although all approximations so far exclude many processes relevant to CCS, such as latency, spatial heterogeneity, seasonality, age structure, and nonexponential infectious periods 40, 43; and (iii) stochastic computer simulations, in which parameterised compartmental models are used to generate distributions of persistence times for populations of different sizes and from which CCS can be estimated 33, 34. However, these studies assume a linear relationship between population size and recruitment, which is unrealistic in natural systems [35]. Beyond studies of measles 44, 45, 46, little work has been done to estimate CCS.",

This method estimates a threshold that is similar to R\n0 (or the effective reproduction number in the endemic case) separately for individual host populations within a multigroup population rather than averaging across all populations [47]. For example, using NGM, mallards and other dabbling ducks were reported to be part of the most likely reservoir community of influenza A in the global water bird population [8]. However, this method focuses strictly on whether persistence is possible (i.e., whether the appropriate reproductive number exceeds 1), and ignores the stochasticity and nonequilibrium dynamics that are central to classical thinking on CCS. Also, implementations of the method have relied on the strong assumption that infection prevalence is at endemic equilibrium in all host species.",

One of the advantages of modelling is that they can be used for partially observed processes [e.g., approximate Bayesian computation 48, 49, state-space models (SSM; [50]), and Markov models 50, 51, 52]. For example, SSMs make an explicit distinction between data that can be observed (e.g., infected individuals detected by surveillance) and the underlying process itself, which might be largely unobserved (e.g., all infection events). Beyer et al. [50] constructed an SSM of rabies persistence in the Serengeti District in Tanzania that used records of humans reporting to hospital with dog bite injuries. Using a state-space implementation of a metapopulation process describing the unobserved process of dog-to-dog transmission between villages, they were able to estimate parameters capturing the effects of intervillage distance and the size of dog populations on rabies dynamics. Based on these, they inferred that it was more likely that dog rabies infections were being imported from unvaccinated domestic dogs in outlying districts, or from wild peri-urban carnivores in the Serengeti district itself, rather than from wildlife residing within the National Park. Despite their advantages, inferences rely on valid assumptions being made about the biological processes embodied in model structure.",

For example, Cross et al.\n[54] used an age-structured model of two interacting elk populations (free-ranging and those receiving supplemental feeding) to investigate the extent to which dispersal from feeding grounds could explain changes in brucellosis seroprevalence in elk around the Yellowstone ecosystem. They found that R\n0 in the free-ranging elk population (the target population) had increased to above 1 over the past 20 years, probably due to changes in elk aggregations that led to enhanced elk-to-elk transmission (i.e., moved from zone C to E in Figure 1).",

            "text": "Genetic inference of cross-species transmission has so far tended to borrow analytical approaches from population genetics and phylogeography 55, 56, 57 (Box 2\n). Genealogy-based methods have particular appeal because, for many pathogens, the accumulation of mutations takes place on approximately the same timescale as transmission. If transmission chains are genetically distinguishable, they can provide complementary information to incidence and prevalence data. For example, given sufficient pathogen genetic variability in the reservoir, genetic data should readily distinguish rare spillover and subsequent transmission in the target from scenarios involving the same incidence due only to a high force of infection from outside the target population (Figure 1, zones B and C, and zones D and E) 57, 58.Box 2Using pathogen genetics to untangle reservoir\u2013target dynamicsMethods based on discrete ancestral state inference offer an appealing statistical way to approach the problem of multihost transmission by fitting probabilistic models to pathogen sequence data [79]. In these methods, genealogies are constructed from the data, and host associations (states) observed at the tips of the trees are used to estimate the conditional probability of being affiliated with a particular host population along all interior branches. Transmission events between host populations and, thus, the net contribution of the reservoir to dynamics in the target, can be enumerated through Markov jump counts 56, 80. A more formal population genetic framework, centred on joint estimation of population sizes and migration rates across all patches 81, 82, can similarly be adapted to deal with pathogen gene flow [83].Although novel approaches based on genetic data open up intriguing opportunities, their resolution has defined limits. As introductions into the target become more frequent, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish contributions of the reservoir from continuous transmission within the target. Increasing genetic resolution by using longer sequences can compensate for this, but only to the point of sequencing entire pathogen genomes. The ability of genetic markers to resolve cross-species transmission processes will also be reduced by potential pathogen flow from the target population back into the reservoir [84].Genetic inference of reservoir\u2013target dynamics has so far also received little formal testing. There is strong reason to suspect that biased sampling can have a profound influence on the inferences generated. For example, genetically unsampled sources of infection will not only remain undetectable, but their contribution will also be wrongly attributed to populations included in the sample (a problem akin to that caused by \u2018ghost populations\u2019 in population genetics [85]). Moreover, inferred transmission dynamics can depend on the relative spatial and temporal density of sampling among host populations. Finally, stuttering chains within the target population can boost the frequency of cases (compare zones A and C in Figure 1, main text) and, hence, the likelihood of detection under sparse sampling; if unaccounted for, this can lead to overestimation of cross-species transmission rates. These complexities can generate significant challenges for the investigation of reservoir\u2013target systems because balanced, representative sampling, proportional to the incidence in each host, is rarely achievable. Therefore, developing robust ways to deal with problems related to sampling in the context of genealogical inference and the reconstruction of transmission histories remains an important focal area for future research.",

            "text": "A reservoir can comprise multiple connected populations of the same or different species (see Figure 1E in Box 1), and, thus, can be represented as a metapopulation. To assess whether this metapopulation is capable of supporting pathogen persistence, we can draw a parallel with ecological theory. Representing the reservoir as a metapopulation, we can extend the notion of metapopulation capacity [59] to that of reservoir capacity (Box 3\n). Reservoir capacity, \u03bb\u2019M, is a measure of the potential of a structured host population to support pathogen persistence in the absence of external imports and, thus, can be used to assess whether a population constitutes a reservoir. A useful benefit is that associated patch values V\ni (i.e., the relative contribution of each population to overall persistence; Box 3) can be used to prioritise populations when designing interventions. The modelling framework encapsulates three processes (within-population processes, transmission between populations, and community-level persistence) and is normally used to investigate one of these processes when it is possible to parameterise the other two.Box 3Reservoir capacity of a metapopulationThe notion of \u2018metapopulation capacity\u2019 [59] captures in a single number \u03bb\u2032\nM the capacity of a fragmented landscape, comprising patches, to support the long-term persistence of a species in the absence of external imports. By analogy, we define \u2018reservoir capacity\u2019 as the capacity of a metapopulation to support the long-term persistence of a pathogen. It can be regarded as a measure of effective host abundance, weighted to take into account structural factors, such as local population sizes and connectivity, that influence fadeout rates within populations and transmission between them.The dynamics of a general metapopulation are governed by Equation I (Figure I\n), in which invasion and fadeout rates are functions of infection status of other populations, as well as factors such as population sizes and transmission rates. Persistence in the metapopulation is controlled by the ratio of population invasion events to disease fadeouts, and these are balanced at equilibrium. Reservoir capacity for this general model is defined in Equation II (Figure I). Reservoir capacity also suggests a persistence threshold. In this deterministic model, a pathogen persists in a given landscape if and only if \u03bb\u2032\nM >1, corresponding to the threshold above which Equation I has a stable nontrivial equilibrium. Although parameterising this kind of metapopulation model is challenging, methodology shared between ecologists and epidemiologists [86] can allow assessments of likely persistence.An attractive feature of this approach is the ability to estimate patch values, V\ni, which are measures of the contribution of individual populations to the persistence threshold that is used to guide interventions. For example, Figure II\nshows the relative contribution of 75 villages in the Serengeti District, Tanzania, to local rabies reservoir capacity, estimated from the Beyer et al.\n50, 87 model discussed in the main text. Although the village shaded in red is the biggest both in terms of size and patch value, for villages with approximately 400 dogs, the patch values range from 0.00 to 0.04 depending on their spatial location relative to other villages (Figure IIB).",

Power can be assessed from predictions based on classical sensitivity or elasticity analysis [64]. Interventions that induce no changes can also be informative if, for example, they allow us to rule out a particular transmission route or source population.

            "text": "The main challenge in using adaptive management lies in balancing knowledge gain that enables improved future control with achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge [66]. It might be that an intervention that optimises the short-term outcome (e.g., one resulting in the greatest reduction of disease prevalence in the target) is also the one that provides the greatest statistical power to test the hypothesis of interest. In other situations, there can be a trade-off between the short-term goals of rapid disease control and the longer-term goals of learning about the system to optimise future control. This is particularly true given the cost of allocating resources to monitoring, the need to include experimental control areas [67], and the challenge of defining efficient experimental designs (e.g., stepped wedged trial; [68]) for the hypothesis being tested 62, 69. For example, faced with limited knowledge about the dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Wisconsin (US), the US Department of Natural Resources established an adaptive management programme to eradicate CWD from the area [70]. The intervention was based on random deer culling, but a key component of the program was the collection of lymph nodes and brain tissue from the culled and harvested deer to assess the spatial distribution of CWD and provide further insights into its epidemiology.",

Triangulation of multiple sources should improve understanding of the validity and generalisation of inferences [72]. By synthesising several lines of evidence, Lembo et al.\n[14] found support for the hypothesis that domestic dogs, rather than wildlife, constitute the maintenance population for canine rabies in northern Tanzania. Their analyses included post-hoc integration of long-term case monitoring data (suggesting that rabies can persist in high-density domestic dog populations), genetic data (showing that a single rabies virus variant circulates among a range of species), and analysis of incidence patterns (indicating that spillover from domestic dog populations initiated only short-lived chains of transmission in other carnivores, consistent with zone C in Figure 1).",

            "text": "Ultimately, we seek a formal statistical integration of different sources of evidence that can be used to characterise reservoir systems. Such integrative approaches are rare, but increasingly powerful methods are being developed. For example, genetic, spatial, and epidemiological data can now be combined to enable detailed reconstruction of transmission within and between host populations (e.g., 73, 74) and time-calibrated phylogenies can be layered with geographical and epidemiological data in a joint framework that enables estimation of the frequency and directionality of interspecies transmission (e.g., 56, 75). For example, based on viral gene sequences and epidemiological data, Faria et al.\n[75] reconstructed the cross-species transmission history of rabies virus between North American bats and identified ecological and evolutionary constraints on transmission patterns. Latent variable models that explicitly parameterise both process and observation models are also well suited to combining data types, particularly when observations are sparse [26]. Developing statistically rigorous analytical methods that integrate multiple data layers is a challenging but exciting area, and key to future progress in infectious disease ecology 76, 77. Box 4\nsummarises outstanding questions in the study of reservoirs of infection.Box 4Outstanding questionsAlthough there are increasingly powerful tools to characterise different components of reservoir\u2013target systems, there are two central challenges that remain to be overcome: (i) determining persistence thresholds for different host populations; and (ii) estimating the rates of cross-species transmission. Instead, we typically make qualitative inferences (as shown in Table 2, main text), which inevitably results in less effective control policies. Advances in the use of genetic data and widely available serology data sets, including their integration with relevant ecological theory such as reservoir capacity, offer promising new ways to approach these challenges.The use of interventions as quasi-experiments can provide robust empirical \u2018top-down\u2019 approaches to characterising reservoirs, particularly if they are designed as \u2018crucial experiments\u2019 [98] that test among multiple hypotheses to eliminate host populations progressively as contributing to a reservoir. However, this approach raises two other challenges: (iii) how to design interventions that allow us to test the quantitative predictions of the level of control needed to eliminate infection in one population; and (iv) how to coordinate the close engagement of the research community with managers charged with improving veterinary and public health.",

Appropriately designed interventions can simultaneously provide direct tests of disease control methodology, deliver health benefits within the target population, and create important research opportunities that can advance understanding of reservoir dynamics. However, to realise these benefits fully, we must form broad-based interdisciplinary teams, engage with their full range of expertise from the earliest planning stages, and support them throughout the lifetime of the intervention.
