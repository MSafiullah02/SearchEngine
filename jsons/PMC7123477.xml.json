In October 2017, the CPC\u2019s 19th Congress, \u2018following the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration and pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative\u2019, incorporated Xi Jinping\u2019s 2013 blueprint into the CPC constitution. This transformed BRI, an economic/commercial/transportation/communications and infrastructure-building endeavour, into a central tenet of China\u2019s national policy.1 That decision formalised BRI\u2019s locus within the Xi regime\u2019s worldview, which the inaugural BRF had underscored in May. Parallel events throughout 2017, fashioning a palimpsest of economic/commercial, transportation/communications, energy and infrastructure, industrial, financial and regulatory convergences, some evolving over decades, began bearing fruit.\n",
