The sequencing of the S1 coding regions of An-4 and An-11 isolates identified 450 and 487 nucleotides respectively (GenBank accession numbers GQ259978 and GQ259979, respectively).

Phylogenetic analysis using the Neighbor Joining method revealed two local isolates (An-4 and An-11) were clustered in different groups (Fig. 2) . In addition to the virological data, VNT indicated that BCoV was widespread in Turkey (Table 1) , which concurs with previous studies reported in Turkey (Alkan, 1998; Alkan et al., 2003; Hasoksuz et al., 2005) . Data showed that BCoV was often detected in feces samples from calves with diarrhea (Table 1 ). In contrast to this, however, one of the BCoV isolates (Ka-55) was recovered from a 3 year-old cow with diarrhea. It is known that BCoV is associated with acute diarrhea of adult cattle, referred to as winter dysentery (Athanassious et al., 1994) , and also the same field strain can cause different clinical infections in cattle in different age groups (calves, heifers and adults) (Park et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2008) .

In this study, BCoVs were detected from both nasal and fecal samples in two calves (An-8 and An-11) in the same herd (Herd No II) ( Table 3) .
