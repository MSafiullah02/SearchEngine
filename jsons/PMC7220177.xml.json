Despite half a century having passed since Kawasaki disease was first reported in Japan, the cause of this condition remains unknown. We did a PubMed database search to identify studies investigating the cause and pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease using the terms \u201cKawasaki disease\u201d, \u201cetiology\u201d, \u201cpathogenesis\u201d, \u201cintravenous immunoglobulin\u201d, \u201ccorticosteroids\u201d, \u201cmacrophage activation syndrome (MAS)\u201d, and \u201cKD shock syndrome\u201d. All relevant articles were evaluated. The most accepted pathogenetic hypothesis supports an aberrant response of the immune system to one or more unidentified pathogens in genetically predisposed subjects. An infectious trigger, however, has not been identified.\nAdded value of this study\nShortly after the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to our region (Bergamo, Italy), we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. We therefore showed that SARS-CoV-2 might cause a severe form of Kawasaki-like disease.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOutbreaks of Kawasaki-like disease might occur in countries affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and might present outside the classic Kawasaki disease phenotype. This condition might be serious and requires prompt and more aggressive management. Future research on the cause of Kawasaki disease and similar syndromes should focus on immune responses to viral triggers.\n",

In 2005, a group from New Haven (CT, USA)29 identified a novel human coronavirus, designated New Haven coronavirus (HCoV-NH), in the respiratory secretions of eight of 11 children with Kawasaki disease versus one of 22 controls tested by RT-PCR. A serological test was not done. This report was followed by commentaries expressing a mixed sense of interest and scepticism.30 The arguments against this association were expressed by a group from Japan, who did a retrospective study31, 32, 33 on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 19 children with Kawasaki disease and 208 controls with respiratory tract infections, and found RNA sequences of HCoV-NH in five (2%) of 208 controls versus zero of 19 children with Kawasaki disease.",

The immunofluorescence assay detected no difference in HCoV-NL63 antibody positivity between patients and controls, whereas HCoV-229E antibody positivity was higher in patients with Kawasaki disease.34 Given the pathogenesis of the disease, serology testing seems a more reliable tool than RT-PCR in detecting the cause of infection. This suggests that the coronavirus family might represent one of the triggers of Kawasaki disease, SARS-CoV-2 being a particularly virulent strain able to elicit a powerful immune response in the host.",

It is possible that in the remaining two patients, who both had a negative serology, confounding factors played a role. One patient was tested just after an infusion of high-dose immunoglobulins. Additionally, qualitative antibody testing is reported to have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85\u201390% when compared with PCR test by nasal swab. It is also possible that this patient represents an usual presentation of Kawasaki disease outside of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, as seen in previous years. Only two patients in group 2 presented a positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2. This finding and the positivity of IgG antibodies suggest a late onset of the disease compared with the primary infection, due to the host immune response. This might be the reason why, in the past, no active viral infection could be shown in this disease. All these results and considerations support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients.",
