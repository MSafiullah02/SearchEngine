            "text": "Feline Coronaviruses (FCoVs) are members of genus Coronavirus, Family Coronaviridae. Two variants of FCoV have been described, Feline Enteric Coronavirus responsible for an enteric disease and Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) the etiological agent of FIP, a fatal disease of domestic and wild cats. FIP development in a small percentage of animals infected with FCoV is related to the occurrence of genomic mutations supported by the close genetic relationship between the higher virulent virus and the parental FCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1997, Vennema et al., 1998, Vennema, 1999). Additionally, FCoVs were classified as Types I and II according to their serological and genomic features. Type I is strictly feline. Type II FCoV, although sharing with Type I a high degree of similarity in the 3\u2032-end of the genome, is antigenic and genetically more related to Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) (Hohdatsu et al., 1991), suggesting that Type II resulted from a homologous and independent recombination event within the S and the M genes of Type I FCoV and CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998). The current information on the geographical distribution of FCoV indicates a high incidence of Type I in Europe, Japan and USA (Addie et al., 2003, Hohdatsu et al., 1992). However in Japan and Taiwan detection of FIP was associated with Type II FCoV (Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Lin et al., 2009). Presently there is no available information about the molecular epidemiology of FCoV in Portugal. Due to the pathogenic impact of this virus in the feline health it was our purpose to investigate the presence of FCoV Types in the Portuguese cat population using a RT-PCR\u2013nested PCR assay previously reported (Addie et al., 2003) and to assess its genetic diversity by heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and phylogenetic analysis.",

After electrophoresis the gel was stained with 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of ethidium bromide in 1\u00d7 TBE and observed in a UV transiluminator. The visualized homoduplexes bands were cuted, eluted at 56 \u00b0C/5 min in 200 \u03bcL H2O of which 1 \u03bcL was re-amplified using the nPCR primers set described above. The resulting amplicons were cloned in pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector System (Promega) according to the manufacture's conditions and sequenced by STAB Vida Lda, Portugal. The nucleotide sequences were submitted to Genbank and were assigned the accession numbers EU327694\u2013EU327752. Sample identification was included in Table 1\n. FCoV.

All the sequences clustered in one branch, although FIPV 79-1146 and 79-1683 grouped together with 100% of bootstrap value. Due to the low number of nucleotides considered in the alignment (170b), a likelihood mapping analysis was preformed (TREE-PUZZLE) to assess its phylogenetic content, revealing 62.86% of fully resolved, 0% of partially resolved and 37.14% of unresolved quartets demonstrating therefore its reliable use to estimate phylogenetic relationships.",

In our analysis 47.5% of the samples were positive in the RT-PCR assay (57/120) and were obtained either from healthy animals or from cats with FIP. Moreover, the vast majority of the amplicons was classified as Type I. Type II was found only in two samples both from cats with FIP. The values found for FCoV Types I and II were in accordance with the distribution reported in Europe and USA (Addie et al., 2003, Benetka et al., 2004) although in Japan and Taiwan a higher prevalence of FCoV Type II was observed in animals with FIP (Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Lin et al., 2009). In our study even though the two FCoV Type II sequences were obtained from sick cats, the low incidence of this viral biotype does not allow any relationship between FCoV II and symptomatic disease.",

The significance of FCoV quasispecies had already been studied (Battilani et al., 2003) suggesting a correlation between high viral genetic diversity within the host and development of disease.
