From the AHc protein, a small peptide NL13 was identified using bioinformatics tools and was predicted to have antioxidant property. Further, the peptide was synthesised and its antioxidant mechanism was addressed at molecular level. NL13 was subjected to various antioxidant assays including DPPH assay, HARS assay, SARS Assay, NO assay and ABTS assay, where NL13 exhibited significant (P < 0.05) potential antioxidant activity compared to its antioxidant control, Trolox. Cytotoxicity was performed on Human whole blood and the cell viability was performed on VERO fibroblast cells. In both assays, it was found that NL13 did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect towards the cells. Further, the intracellular ROS was performed on Multimode reader followed by imaging on fluorescence microscope which showed scavenging activity even at lower concentration of NL13 (31.2 \u00b5M). An effective wound healing property of NL13 on VERO cells was confirmed by analysing the cell migration rate at two different time intervals (24 and 48 h) . Overall, the study shows that NL13 peptide scavenges the intracellular oxidative stress.",

A wound can be an injury in any normal tissue by physical, thermal, chemical or microbial effects that results in damaging tissues at molecular and cellular levels. Wound healing is a vital biochemical and physiological process that can be challenged due to free radicals. The process of wound healing takes place in three successive phases such as inflammation phase, tissue formation phase and remodelling phase [5] . Proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors are secreted by white blood cells during inflammation. It is followed by strengthening of new granulation tissue by laying collagen in the wound by fibroblasts. In the third phase, the new cells are formed around the wound and new matrix is created which reduces the extracellular matrix and its component [6] .",

At the site of injury, excess amount of protease and reactive oxygen species are formed by the accumulation of neutrophils and it restricts the oxidative damage of protease inhibitor [7] . Reactive oxygen species is developed at the wound site in larger quantities as a protection against invasive bacteria. The existence of increased number of neutrophils and ROS, nevertheless, overwhelms the antiprotease substances that usually shield the cells and extracellular matrix. Reactive oxygen species can cause severe tissue damage at high concentrations and even contribute to neoplastic transformation, which inhibits the healing process through disruption of cell membranes, DNA, proteins and lipids. Fibroblasts can be killed and excess ROS make skin lipids less flexible. As a consequence, the ultimate involvement of antioxidants in the successful treatment and maintenance of wound tends to be important. Such adverse effects of wounds are minimized due to antioxidants by eliminating inflammatory compounds. They counteract the excess proteases and ROS which are often produced due to the accumulation of neutrophils in the injury [6, 7] . Antioxidant protection is a mechanism that includes the interaction between the compound and the hydroxyl peroxidase rather than just limiting the cell membrane damage [8] . Many compounds have been reported to show wound healing activity with the property of high radical scavenging capacity [6] .",

It was grown in 1 l flasks containing modified Zarrouk's medium (Cogne) at temperature 30 \u00b0C, pH 9.5 with a 12 L/12 D cycle [20] . The cells grown in Zarrouk medium was served as control. For analysing sulphur deprivation studies, A. platensis was cultured in an altered Zarrouk medium that was supplemented with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% chloride instead of sulphate. The growth rate of A. platensis was measured once in alternative days in spectrophotometer at 655 nm. The culture was utilised to study the expression pattern of ApAHc, thus sampling was taken at every 5 days interval until the study was completed on day 20. The collected cells were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and further stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until the gene expression study was evaluated.",

The physio-chemical properties of ApAHc were determined by DNAssist software (ver. 2.2). The obtained results data signified that ApAHc has a coding region of 1281 base pairs, that encodes a protein of 426 amino acids capable of 46.509 k Da as molecular weight and 5.53 as isoelectric point (pI). The amino acids consist of three domains namely S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase coenzymes transport metabolism as the biggest domain ( 9 Lys-Thr 425 ), S-adenosyl-l-homocysteinehydrolase ( 10 Tyr-Thr 425 ) and S-Adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase NAD-binding site catalytic domain ( 19 Pro-Trp 421 ) with four different motifs which forms the NAD binding site, ligand binding site, polypeptide binding site and catalytic site (Data shown in E-Suppl. File Fig. 1 ). S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase forms the biggest domain ( 9 Lys-Thr 425 ) in ApAHc that is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-l-methionine and plays a major role in modulating the methyltransferase activity. SabH composed of two domains includes cofactor binding domain and substrate-binding domain [30] which is present in ApAHc. The homocysteine precursor present in the AHc is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease and growth of atherosclerosis [31] . However, recently reported that AHc also helps in regulating oxidative stress level in patients suffering from coronary artery diseases and also prevents endothelial dysfunction [32] . Also, deficiency of AHc promotes oxidative stress by decreasing Na + , K + -ATPase activity in cerebral cortex of rats by increasing S-adenosylmethionine [33] .",

Moreover, the multiple sequence analysis revealed that ApAHc has shown 99, 87.2, 87.06 and 81.1% similarity with the homologues groups including P. agardh, L. aestuarii, O. cyanobacterium and N. commune, respectively (Data shown in E-Suppl.

Multiple sequence analysis was done by grouping other cyanobacteria like P. agardhi [34] , L. aestuarii, O. cyanobacterium and N. commune with A. platensis [35, 36] which has been reported to have antioxidant property. It is noted that the functional regions of AHc from all the species taken for analysis are highly conserved among them, which further proved the potentiality of the molecule.

Further, this cyanobacterial group formed another cluster with plants; then finally formed a separate cluster with animals including fish, amphibians and mammals. Overall, the analysis showed the evolutionary relationship among the species.

Moreover, the secondary structure of corn protein hydrolysates was determined under circular dichroism that shows the lower \u03b1-helix is the major cause of strong antioxidant activity [38] .

The HPLC analysis showed the purity of the peptide as 96.2% followed by the MALDI-TOF Mass spectroscopy confirmed the sequence. The molecular weight, isoelectric point and net charge of the peptide was 1.33 k Da, 0.54 and \u2212 2, respectively. Moreover, the peptide signifies the hydrophobicity 46.15%, acidic nature 15.33% and neutral nature 38.46%. The helical wheel structure projects the amphipathic nature of NL13 which is possessed with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature (Data shown in E-Suppl. File Fig. 6 ). Branched-chain amino acids including leucine, valine and isoleucine have found to be used as an antioxidant or antiinflammatory products in the pharmaceutical industry [39] . Potential amino acids have shown strong antioxidant activity in Leucine than Isoleucine in Corn protein hydrolysates [38] . In accordance with the statement, our peptide NL13 also contained leucine (position 3 and 13) and valine (position 9) which predicted its potential antioxidant properties. Further Wattanasiritham et al. [20] reported that along with leucine and valine, alanine exhibit a higher antioxidant activity. It is noted that in our peptide sequence position 10 and 11 was occupied with alanine, position 3 and 13 was occupied with leucine and position 9 by valine. Proline has been considered as a non-enzymatic antioxidant residue because it is an efficient scavenger of OH \u00b7 and 1 O 2 ; that also prevents the damage due to lipid peroxidation [40] . It is interesting to note that NL13 contained proline at position 2, hence it is expected to function as reported. Moreover, antioxidant properties are also based on the hydrophobicity and the presence of aromatic amino acids. Also, it is reported [22] that the peptides with more than 1 k Da have found to show the highest antioxidant activity in African Bean seed protein hydrolysate fractions, which is relevant to our peptide, NL13 that is having a molecular weight of 1.33 k Da.",

Similarly, Xie et al. [41] reported that soy proteins hydrolysates have found to show the highest hydroxyl scavenging activity which is in accordance with our findings. Sun et al. [46] also reported that PHH-IV peptide derived from Procine haemoglobin hydrolysate less than 3 kDa exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity compared to the other peptides derived with higher molecular weight. Proline is a very effective scavenger of hydroxyl ions and peptide NL13 contains Proline (7.7%), it is predicted that the highest activity may be due to the presence of Proline. It is known that excess hydroxyl radical causes damage in biological system, it has been maintained at an optimum level. Considering the statement, it is suggested that NL13 could act as radical scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, so as to protect from oxidative damage.",
