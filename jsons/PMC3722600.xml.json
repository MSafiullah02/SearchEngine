The disease first appeared in the Guangdong province of southeast China and rapidly spread to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and over 30 other countries on six continents. By the end of the epidemic, over 8000 cases were reported with an overall mortality rate of approximately 10% (CDC, 2003). Although the precise origin of the virus has not been elucidated, evidence suggests that the virus likely was transmitted from bats in China through an intermediate host such as the masked palm civet to humans (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Ren et al., 2006).",

Disease severity was shown to correlate with the early onset of neutralizing antibody responses; the presence of neutralizing antibody within the first two weeks of illness was associated with increased risk of mortality (Ho et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2006). Recovering patients continued to increase serum neutralizing antibody concentrations, peaking at approximately day 20, whereas fatal cases demonstrated dramatically reduced neutralizing antibody after day 15 of symptom onset (Zhang et al., 2006). This suggests that sustainable levels of neutralizing antibody are correlated with recovery of SARS-CoV-infected patients.",

Primary hamster tracheobronchial epithelial cell cultures support higher virus replication in comparison to similar murine cultures, suggesting an increased susceptibility of hamster cells to SARS-CoV infection (Sims et al., 2005). Histopathological evidence of disease is evident in hamster tissues, with cellular necrosis, pronounced interstitial inflammation, focal consolidation in pulmonary tissues, and loss of ciliated epithelial cells being prominent features (Roberts et al., 2005b); however, there is limited morbidity and no mortality associated with infection. Increasing the severity of disease in the hamster model may provide a useful tool for study of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, antiviral drug testing, and for analysis of mutant viruses deleted of one or more of the eight viral accessory genes.",

Cyclophosphamide, a bifunctional alkylating agent, has been shown to cause lymphopenia, suppress B-cell activity and activation, and suppress regulatory T-cell function (Cupps et al., 1982, Ikezawa et al., 2005, Polak and Turk, 1974, Zhu et al., 1987). CP has been utilized in various animal models for virus infection analysis, often increasing the morbidity and mortality observed in virus-infected animals (Blandford and Charlton, 1977, Genovesi and Peters, 1987, Kercher and Mitchell, 2000, Kong et al., 2005, Mateo et al., 2006, Sidwell et al., 2003, Smee et al., 1991). Recently, CP-induced immunosuppression of Syrian golden hamsters was shown to enhance adenovirus replication and pathology, and permitted the efficacy testing of a broad-spectrum antiviral, CMX001 (Toth et al., 2008).",

A similar infection and pathogenesis pattern was observed after infection with rSARS-CoV mutants defective for the expression of accessory proteins ORF7a and ORF7b suggesting the functions of these proteins are not required in this model.

Animals were given a loading dose followed by maintenance doses at specified intervals to maintain immunosuppression.

No significant difference was observed between rSARS-CoV and rSARS-CoV GFP\u0394ORF7ab with respect to infectious virus titers in lung, liver, and kidney tissues (P\n > 0.05). The rSARS-CoV GFP\u0394ORF7ab virus-infected hamsters appeared to have higher virus titers in the spleen, but the difference was not statistically significant (P\n = 0.085). Finally, heart tissues were analyzed for viral titers in saline-treated and moribund CP-D treated animals infected with rSARS-CoV (Fig. 3D). No virus was detected in hearts from saline-treated, infected animals; however, high viral titers were observed in the heart tissues from CP-D treated animals. Although the tissue specific expression of ACE2 (the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV) has not been determined in hamsters, ACE2 is expressed in heart, kidney, and testes in humans (Donoghue et al., 2000, Tipnis et al., 2000). The high viral titers in the hearts of these animals suggest that ACE2 is also present in heart tissues of hamsters. Of note, heart pathology has also been observed in human tissues from fatal SARS cases, including cardiac edema and atrophy of myocardial fibers (Chong et al., 2004, Ding et al., 2003, Gu et al., 2005, Lang et al., 2003).",

No mortality was observed. STAT1\u2212/\u2212 129SvEv mice were analyzed as a potential animal model and displayed a prolonged infection period with extrapulmonary spread to the liver and spleen, and histopathological findings of acute interstitial pneumonia (Hogan et al., 2004), although no mortality was reported. The first murine models that demonstrated severe disease and mortality utilized C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 \u00d7 C3H/HeJ mice transgenic for human ACE2, the SARS-CoV cellular receptor (McCray et al., 2007, Tseng et al., 2007). Infection of the transgenic mice resulted in a severe and rapid progression of disease with 100% mortality by day 7\u20138 pi. Virus replication was detected in several organs with high virus titers in the brain by day 3. Although potentially useful for pathogenesis studies, the severe and rapid nature of disease coupled with the prominent, neurologic involvement may constrain their usefulness as a small animal model for SARS-CoV. Additionally, a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV has been generated via 15 serial passages through BALB/c mice (Roberts et al., 2007). This virus is capable of causing severe disease in mice with extrapulmonary spread; however, as with the transgenic ACE2 mice, the disease is rapid causing death within 5 days of inoculation.",

Subacute inflammation of the ventricular myocardium was observed in immunosuppressed, rSARS-CoV infected animals, with increasing severity being observed between days 19 and 23/24 pi. The latter changes (chronic bronchointerstitial pneumonia and myocardial inflammation) likely contributed to the severity of clinical disease necessitating sacrifice of moribund animals 23\u201324 days pi. It is important to note that we did not see pathology in the gastrointestinal tract or in the brain of any SARS-CoV infected hamsters.
