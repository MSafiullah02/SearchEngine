Also, the virus travelled from Hong Kong to Beijing, where alone more than 3000 SARS cases were recorded. Altogether, about 8000 cases have been registered worldwide, of whom about 10% did not survive. SARS was characterized by an atypical, severe pneumonia (for recent reviews commemorating the 2003 SARS outbreak and discussing the lessons learned, see 1, 2, 3, 4).",

In 2004 human coronavirus NL63, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, was described 11, 12, followed by the discovery of HCoV HKU1, a clade\u2010a betacoronavirus, a year later 13. These viruses are widespread but do not cause severe disease in the majority of people infected by them 14. In September 2012 another novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, was described 15. It had been detected in patients from Saudi Arabia and other countries on the Arab peninsula or in people who had a history of travel to the Middle East. The earliest cluster of MERS cases detected so far was in Jordan in April 2012, as shown retrospectively on the basis of patient samples. Symptoms of MERS include severe respiratory disease and often renal failure; as of 4 July 2014, 827 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases have been recorded, with 287 deaths (http://www.who.int). The case\u2013fatality ratio of MERS is thus alarmingly high.",

However, it took until 2013 to discover a bat coronavirus that is more than 95% identical to SARS\u2010CoV and uses the same receptor on the surface of host cells, the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 20. In the case of MERS coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), bats were again suspected to be the reservoir as a few coronaviruses with high sequence similarity to MERS\u2010CoV were discovered in African and European bats 21, 22, but in recent months the picture has changed somewhat and dromedary camels are now the main suspects of being the reservoir from where the zoonotic transmission into the human population originates 23, 24.",

Thus, it must be said that more effort could (and should) have been made to develop small\u2010molecule compounds with anti\u2010coronavirus activity; this was hampered, however, by a sharp decline in funding of coronavirus research in many countries after 2005\u20132006, and lack of support from the scientific community. As a consequence, not all lessons that the SARS outbreak taught us were taken seriously (discussed in 1). But the recent \u2013 and still continuing \u2013 emergence of MERS\u2010CoV has illustrated that such an event can happen anywhere, at any time, given the large number of coronavirus species in Nature, of which we probably only know a fraction so far. Coronaviruses feature the largest RNA genome (about 30 kb; Fig. 1) known, and this genome is extremely flexible in terms of incorporation and deletion of gene products in response to evolutionary pressure such as the need to adapt to a new host. The coronavirus genome is also prone to recombination events, thereby adding further to its flexibility.",

In doing so, I will focus on the main antiviral drug targets, the coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called the 3C\u2010like protease, 3CLpro) and the papain\u2010like protease (PLpro). Other enzymes of the coronaviruses, such as the helicase and the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, are also targets for antiviral drug discovery, but such efforts are limited so far because of the lack of crystal structures for these enzymes (see 25 for a recent review). The coronaviral proteases Mpro and PLpro are responsible for processing the huge polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are encoded by open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the coronavirus genome, into mature non\u2010structural proteins (Nsps), most of which form part of the coronaviral replication/transcription complex (Fig. 1; for information on other SARS\u2010CoV protein structures see 1, 25, 26, 27).",

            "text": "My group had started working on the coronavirus Mpro around 1999. At that time, not a single crystal structure of a coronavirus protein had been determined. We first elucidated the crystal structure of the Mpro of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus that is fatal for young piglets. Published in 2002 29, the structure revealed that the Mpro is a dimer (cf. Fig. 2) in which the N\u2010terminus (the \u2018N\u2010finger\u2019) of one monomer helps shape the S1 substrate\u2010specificity pocket and the oxyanion hole of the other monomer; hence, dimerization is a prerequisite for catalytic activity. It also revealed the presence of an \u03b1\u2010helical domain (domain III) in addition to domains I and II, which together feature a chymotrypsin\u2010like fold and harbor the catalytic Cys\u2026His dyad between them. Subsequently, we synthesized a chloromethylketone inhibitor and cocrystallized it with the TGEV Mpro in order to visualize the substrate\u2010binding site in detail 30. At the same time, we also determined the structure of the Mpro of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E). When SARS\u2010CoV was identified and sequenced in the spring of 2003, we built the first homology model of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro on the basis of the structure of the enzyme from HCoV 229E 30. We further suggested, on the basis of the binding mode of our chloromethylketone inhibitor, that the Michael acceptor compound AG7088 (rupintrivir), which was being developed by Pfizer as an inhibitor of the 3C protease of human rhinovirus 31, should be a good starting point for anti\u2010SARS drug design 30, 32. Later, this compound turned out not to have particularly high activity against SARS\u2010CoV in cell culture, but derivatives of this Michael acceptor lead turned out to exhibit good anti\u2010coronaviral activity in vitro and ex vivo\n33, 34, 35. Towards the end of the SARS outbreak in Beijing (in June 2003), the crystal structure of the SARS\u2010CoV main protease itself was determined through a collaboration between the group of Zihe Rao in Beijing, who had recombinantly produced and crystallized the enzyme, and my group, both as the free protease (Fig. 2) and in complex with the chloromethylketone inhibitor that we had already used for the TGEV Mpro\n36.",

            "text": "The first structure of the free SARS\u2010CoV Mpro\n36 was determined from crystals that had been grown at acidic pH (around 6.0); in this structure, one monomer of the Mpro dimer was in the active state and the other one in a catalytically incompetent conformation in which the S1 specificity pocket and the oxyanion hole were collapsed. When the same crystals were equilibrated in buffer of pH 7.4, both monomers were found in the active conformation, whereas at pH 8.0 the substrate\u2010binding site was less well defined due to increasing flexibility of the amino acid side\u2010chains involved. This phenomenon was explained by molecular dynamics simulations run with different protonation states for two key histidine residues (His163 and His172) involved in shaping the S1 substrate\u2010binding site 37. The pH\u2013activity profile of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro was found to be very probably determined by protonation of His163 (inactivation at acidic pH) and deprotonation of His172 (inactivation at basic pH) 37. The observation of the catalytically incompetent form (with the S1 site and the oxyanion hole collapsed) has occasionally been ascribed (e.g. 38) to the presence of five additional residues at the N\u2010terminus that remained from the cloning procedure; the phenomenon has not been observed with enzyme featuring authentic chain termini when crystalized in space group C2 39. We have determined structures of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro with authentic chain termini from crystals grown with other symmetries and did observe the presence of both an active and an inactive monomer at low pH 40 (Verschueren et al., unpublished). The existence of a less active proform of the enzyme may allow control of the temporal order of processing the individual polyprotein cleavage sites to release intermediate and mature Nsps at the time in replication when they are needed. Unfortunately, the pH at the site of action of the Mpro, at the endoplasmic\u2010reticulum\u2010derived double\u2010membrane vesicles 28, is not known.",

            "text": "Before auto\u2010activation and liberation from the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, the Mpro (Nsp5) is an integral part of these polyproteins (Fig. 1). The mechanism of auto\u2010activation of the enzyme is not well understood (see 38 for a review). Several studies have used constructs carrying fluorescent proteins at both termini of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro and connected to the enzyme by peptide sequences containing Mpro cleavage sites 41, 42. Such polyprotein models are usually monomeric, but dimer formation upon addition of substrates has been observed 41. We have found that upon mutation of three residues (Arg4, Glu290 and Arg298) involved in the monomer\u2013monomer interface of the mature protease, the resulting monomeric enzyme can still perform N\u2010terminal autocleavage, while dimerization and trans\u2010cleavage activity are completely inhibited by the Glu290Arg and Arg298Glu mutations and partly so by the Arg4Glu mutation. Furthermore, the mature Glu290Arg mutant can resume N\u2010terminal autocleavage activity when mixed with an inactive Mpro species, whereas its trans\u2010cleavage activity remains absent. Therefore the N\u2010terminal autoprocessing of the Mpro appears to require only two \u2018immature\u2019 monomers approaching one another to form an \u2018intermediate\u2019 dimer structure and does not depend on the active dimer conformation existing in the mature protease 43. The octameric form of the immature Mpro, which features a three\u2010dimensional swap of the helical domain III of the enzyme 44, may play a role in the auto\u2010activation process.",

            "text": "A large number of crystal structures have been published of inhibitor complexes of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro, of which only a few can be mentioned here. Many types of chemical warheads have been used to achieve covalent binding of peptidic or peptidomimetic inhibitors to the active\u2010site cysteine of the Mpro, including the halomethylketones 30, 36, 45 and Michael acceptor compounds (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated esters) 33, 34, 35 mentioned above, aldehydes 46, 47, 48, 49, \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010epoxyketones 50, 51, 52, nitriles 53 and phthalhydrazide ketones 54, 55. All of these compounds are peptidomimetics carrying electrophilic warheads, and several also efficiently inhibit SARS\u2010CoV replication in cell culture. Some of the inhibitors, such as for example halomethylketones, are certainly too reactive to be developed into drugs, as they are expected to exhibit considerable side\u2010effects. One might intuitively assume the same of aldehydes, but in fact peptide aldehyde inhibitors of thrombin (such as efegatran) did not show toxicity in clinical trials 56, 57. Also, it should be noted that two hepatitis C virus NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors introduced into the market in 2011, telaprivir and boceprivir, are peptidomimetics carrying the \u03b1\u2010ketoamide warhead 58. Finally, rupintrivir (AG7088) is an example of a Michael acceptor compound that was developed as an inhibitor of the 3C protease of human rhinovirus 31. There is a trend away from non\u2010covalent binders of target serine or cysteine proteases and towards covalent reversible or irreversible binders. Given the absolute requirement of the coronavirus Mpro for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate, and the absence of human proteases with the same specificity, there is a good chance of developing coronavirus protease inhibitors carrying electrophilic warheads without having to expect too many side\u2010effects (see above). Figure 3 shows the binding of our broad\u2010spectrum Michael acceptor compound SG85, which we originally developed against the enterovirus 3C protease 59, in complex with the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro, as revealed by X\u2010ray crystallography (Zhu et al., unpublished; PDB code http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=3TNT). In agreement with the expectation outlined above, this compound shows no sign of toxicity in Huh\u2010T7 or Vero A cells (CC50 = 256 and 190 \u03bcm, respectively 59) or in mice (Leyssen, Neyts et al., unpublished), while it exhibits an IC50 of around 2 \u03bcm both against the isolated SARS\u2010CoV Mpro and in a SARS\u2010CoV replicon and of about 3.3 \u03bcm in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero B4 cells (Zhu, Kusov, Muth et al., unpublished).",

Therefore, the search for inhibitors of the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro focused on screening chemical libraries for non\u2010peptidic, reversible inhibitors of the enzyme. This way, Ratia et al. 78 and Ghosh et al. 79, 80 identified hit compounds that were further optimized to yield inhibitors with submicromolar activities against the isolated enzyme and low\u2010micromolar activities in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cell cultures (see also 81). The hit\u2010to\u2010lead optimization relied heavily on crystal structures of complexes between selected candidate inhibitors and the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro. Several of the inhibitors discovered this way, e.g. GRL0617 78, did not bind directly to the catalytic site of the protease but near the S3 and S4 sites (these are more spacious than the restricted S1 and S2 sites, which can accommodate exclusively glycine residues of the substrates, i.e. viral polyprotein or ubiquitin). Figure 4 shows the inhibitor GRL0617 (space\u2010filling presentation) bound to the S3 and S4 sites, far from the catalytic triad (cyan sticks).",

Obviously, the goal is not to cure bats from their coronavirus infections (being the reservoir, most bats do not show any sign of disease when they carry coronaviruses), but we want to design inhibitors for these enzymes to have them ready in case of a zoonotic transmission of a bat coronavirus into the human population. The idea is to design and synthesize one or more lead compound(s) with broad\u2010spectrum anti\u2010coronaviral activity, which can immediately enter preclinical development in the case of a major epidemic. At the outset of this project, we selected three bat coronaviruses as representatives for coronavirus families: Bt\u2010CoV HKU8 as an alphacoronavirus 82, Bt\u2010CoV HKU4 as a betacoronavirus of clade c 83 and Bt\u2010HKU9 as a betacoronavirus of clade d 83, 84. (We excluded Betacoronavirus clades a and b as no bat coronaviruses of the former are known and clade b is already presented by the well\u2010studied SARS\u2010CoV.) So far, we have determined the crystal structures of the Mpros of Bt\u2010CoV HKU8 (Ma et al., unpublished) and HKU4 (Xiao et al., unpublished; PDB codes http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=2YNA, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=2YNB) and have noticed that our above\u2010mentioned broad\u2010spectrum antiviral SG85, a Michael acceptor compound 59, inhibited the HKU4 (but not the HKU8) enzyme. Proof\u2010of\u2010principle for our \u2018predictive\u2019 approach came when MERS\u2010CoV emerged in 2012 and we found that SG85 was indeed a good inhibitor of this virus in cell culture (Xiao, de Wilde, Muth et al., to be published). BtCoV HKU4 turned out to be a close relative of MERS\u2010CoV, with 81% amino acid sequence identity (90% similarity) for the main protease.",

A three\u2010dimensional structure was described for the Mpro shortly after the discovery of the new virus 85, but unfortunately atomic coordinates have not been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The same publication describes the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro inhibitor N3, a Michael acceptor compound 33, as a good inhibitor of the MERS\u2010CoV Mpro\n85. The structure of the papain\u2010like protease of the new virus has also been determined 86. The enzyme features significant differences from the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro. Thus, the stabilization of the oxyanion intermediate of the proteolytic reaction catalyzed by the MERS\u2010CoV PLpro appears to be different from the mechanism proposed for the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro\n75. In papain\u2010like proteases, the oxyanion is commonly stabilized by two hydrogen bonds from the enzyme, one donated by the main\u2010chain amide of the catalytic residue, here Cys111, and the other from a glutamine or asparagine side\u2010chain five or six residues N\u2010terminal to the catalytic cysteine. In SARS\u2010CoV PLpro, the corresponding side\u2010chain is that of Trp107, which is proposed to donate a hydrogen bond to the oxyanion from the indole nitrogen 75. But in the MERS\u2010CoV PLpro this tryptophan is replaced by Leu106, which lacks hydrogen\u2010bonding capability. Interestingly, the Leu106Trp mutation of the MERS\u2010CoV PLpro increases the peptidolytic and deubiquitinating activities of the enzyme by factors of 60 and 3.4, respectively 86, indicating that the protease has not been optimized for maximum activity during evolution of the virus. Other differences between the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro and the MERS\u2010CoV PLpro include the S3 and S5 specificity subsites. These subsites accommodate arginine residues of ubiquitin in the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro\u2010ubiquitin complex 76, 77 and arginine or lysine at the PLpro cleavage sites in the viral polyprotein. Accordingly, the subsites are dominated by negatively charged amino acid side\u2010chains in the SARS\u2010CoV enzyme, i.e. Asp165 in the S3 site and Glu168 in the S5 site. However, in the MERS\u2010CoV PLpro, the latter residue is replaced by the positively charged Arg168. Hence, direct extrapolation from the structure of the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro\u2010ubiquitin complex 76, 77 to ubiquitin recognition by the MERS\u2010CoV enzyme is not possible; rather, the crystal structure of the complex has to be awaited.",

Nevertheless, I hope that I was able in this review to illustrate the important role played by X\u2010ray crystallography in elucidating the three\u2010dimensional structures of two important targets for the discovery and development of anti\u2010coronavirus drugs, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain\u2010like protease (PLpro). In fact, most of the peptidomimetic inhibitors of the Mpro were designed on the basis of the structural knowledge of the enzyme, whereas several non\u2010peptidic inhibitors were identified by using the crystal structure of the target for virtual screening of chemical libraries. The known inhibitors of the PLpro, on the other hand, are mostly based on original hits identified in high\u2010throughput screening or virtual screening campaigns against the recombinant enzyme, which were subsequently optimized according to their docking to the SARS\u2010CoV PLpro or to the crystal structure of their complex with the target. However, none of the compounds directed against the coronavirus proteases has gone through a complete preclinical development program, mainly because of a sharp decline in funding in most countries in 2005\u20132006. Nonetheless, some of the inhibitors described so far are good starting points for development in the case of future zoonotic transmissions of coronaviruses into the human population, or in the case of a continuation of the MERS outbreak.",

Yet, these viruses potentially pose a big threat to man, as we were impressively taught by the SARS coronavirus 1, and we are well advised to increase our preparedness in view of the increasing frequency of outbreaks caused by these viruses 87, 88. Academic institutions have important tasks in these efforts at increasing preparedness, as far as the preclinical discovery phase of the drug development process is concerned 89.
