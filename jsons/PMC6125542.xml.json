            "text": "Human disease caused by flaviviruses represents a growing source of global health concern, with elevated numbers of deaths and cases of severe disease (1, 2). The incidence of flavivirus-related disease has increased during recent years. This is possibly related to multiple environmental and socioeconomic factors, such as long-distance spread of pathogenic flaviviruses (e.g., introduction to a different continent) and broader dissemination in temperate climate regions (1, 3, 4). Despite having had limited relevance to public health prior to 2007 (only 14 cases reported), recent large epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Asia and the Americas have had a major socioeconomic impact. It is estimated that there have been over 1 million cases of infection, leading to several thousand people suffering from severe disease (2, 5). In addition to severe neurological conditions, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and congenital microcephaly, a wide range of disorders linked to the establishment of persistent infection in different tissues have been documented (6\u201310).",

In particular, viruses infecting birds, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV), have been related to recent cases of neurologic disease in temperate countries (11\u201314). Increased incidence of flaviviral disease seems to be connected to climate change and its impact on the migratory dynamics of birds and the geographic spread of mosquito vectors (15\u201318). USUV has caused recent epidemics in birds across Europe, with elevated mortality in some species, such as blackbirds, owls, and other wild and captive animals (15, 19). Recent sporadic cases of human disease geographically connected to these outbreaks are raising concerns of USUV becoming a potential threat to global health (11, 13, 15, 18, 20\u201324).",

            "text": "Lethal mutagenesis has long been proposed as a broad-spectrum strategy to control viral infections, with recent data supporting its feasibility and efficacy in vivo (25, 26). The rationale for antiviral therapies based on mutagenesis stems from theoretical studies by Eigen and colleagues (27, 28). These investigations led to the proposal that the elevated error frequencies during RNA virus replication are in the proximity of a maximum tolerated value for viability, namely, the error threshold (28\u201330). Mutation rates beyond this value would be incompatible with maintaining meaningful genetic information, and thus virus propagation, leading to the extinction of the population in a process known as error catastrophe (28\u201330). The theory was empirically proven using mutagenic agents that induce increased mutation frequencies in viruses (31\u201334). A vast repertoire of molecules that exert broad-spectrum antiviral activities linked to viral mutagenesis have been identified, including nucleoside and nonnucleoside compounds (25, 32, 35\u201340). Mutagenic nucleosides can be incorporated into newly synthesized viral RNA genomes after their intracellular conversion into phosphorylated nucleoside analogues (32, 41\u201346).",

Several recent studies have indicated an association between mutagenesis and antiviral activity in vivo. We have demonstrated that the ribonucleoside favipiravir can cure persistent murine norovirus infection in the mouse intestine. This antiviral activity is accompanied by increased mutation frequency and decreased specific infectivity, both signatures of error catastrophe, in samples isolated preceding complete viral clearance (25). Additional evidence of antiviral mutagenesis in vivo has been obtained from the analysis of HCV-infected patients treated with ribavirin (50). Larger mutation frequencies accompanied by decreased specific infectivity were also observed in Hantaan virus recovered from infected mice treated with ribavirin (26). Several other studies have provided additional indirect proof of antiviral mutagenesis in vivo, further stimulating the development of therapies based on this strategy (51\u201358).",

We observe that ribavirin, favipiravir, and 5-fluorouracil are all inhibitors of both ZIKV and USUV, and that consecutive passage of virus in the presence of these drugs can lead to the complete extinction of infectivity. Notably, the efficacies of these drugs vary depending on the virus. The molecules exhibiting better antiviral efficacies are typically associated with higher mutagenicity of the corresponding virus. However, the relative increases in mutation frequency observed for each drug treatment differ in USUV and ZIKV. We observed the highest mutation frequencies in ZIKV when treated with ribavirin and favipiravir, and in USUV when treated with 5-fluorouracil. The relevance of these results to a better understanding of flavivirus replication, genetic diversity, and the development of prospective antiviral therapies will be discussed.",

Decitabine is an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (39, 67). Its antiviral activity has been associated with lethal mutagenesis, and it is possibly related to the incorporation of the phosphorylated deoxyribonucleoside derivative into viral cDNA during reverse transcription (39, 67). We have included this analogue as a negative control for antiviral mutagenesis in our RNA viral targets, as it is not predicted to be a substrate of RNA polymerases. We first investigated the toxicities of these compounds on Vero cells (Fig. 1). Only prolonged treatments with 5-fluorouracil (48 h) led to cell death rates above 20%. The remaining drugs only showed modest or no effect on cellular viability even after prolonged exposures to the highest concentration tested (800 \u03bcM).",

As predicted, decitabine showed no effect on ZIKV replication, further supporting the idea that the antiviral activity elicited by the ribonucleosides is directly related to their incorporation by the viral RNA polymerase (Fig. 2C). Further analysis of ZIKV replication kinetics in the presence of different concentrations of each drug suggests that these molecules exhibit a similar inhibitory capacity.

            "text": "We further analyzed the antiviral efficacies of these drugs against ZIKV during prolonged treatment by testing their capacity to abolish infectivity during consecutive viral passages in cell culture. Sequential infections of ZIKV in the presence of these drugs resulted in a total loss of infectivity when a final concentration of 800 \u03bcM was used (except for decitabine; Fig. 3). The complete extinction of ZIKV infectivity was replicated in three independent lineages of passages in each drug (Fig. 3D and G). Favipiravir eliminated ZIKV in a faster manner (undetectable viral levels reported after 4 passages for all the three independent lineages) than ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil (all three lineages were extinct after 5 passages). The extinction of ZIKV populations in these samples was confirmed by performing an additional blind passage in cell culture in the absence of mutagens (data not shown). We did not observe any detectable infectivity or viral RNA in the samples recovered, confirming that these three nucleosides completely eliminate ZIKV infectivity. Serial passage of ZIKV in cells treated with ribavirin or favipiravir at lower concentrations (100 to 400 \u03bcM) also resulted in a gradual decrease in infectivity, with the two drugs presenting similar efficacies (Fig. 3A to C, E, and F). Unlike favipiravir and ribavirin, ZIKV exhibited lower susceptibility to passages in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, suggesting that this molecule is a weaker inhibitor or mutagen for this virus. As anticipated, decitabine had no effect on infectivity, as the viral titers measured during serial transfers were similar to those found in passages of virus in the absence of drug (Fig. 3D and G). A typical signature of lethal mutagenesis is that viral populations isolated in passages preceding extinction show reduced specific infectivity (30, 68). To investigate whether ZIKV populations treated with these compounds manifested any alteration in their specific infectivity values, we determined the proportion of infectious particles relative to the total number of viral RNA molecules in the sample. We confirmed that viral populations rescued after treatment with all three drugs exhibited lower specific infectivity than the untreated viruses, and most significantly those treated with favipiravir (Fig. 4).",

All three nucleosides (favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil) that inhibited ZIKV replication also manifested antiviral activity on USUV (Fig. 5). Likewise, treatment with decitabine exhibited no effect on USUV replication (Fig. 5B and C). In contrast to what we had observed with ZIKV, 5-fluorouracil was the most effective compound against USUV (Fig. 5). Single-cycle infection kinetics experiments with drugs at 800 \u03bcM revealed that 5-fluorouracil antiviral activity becomes more prominent at later replication time points (Fig. 5A). This is also observed when the same drugs are tested against USUV during multiple cycles of infection (infections at low multiplicity of infection [MOI]). The relative activity of 5-fluorouracil compared to those of ribavirin and favipiravir is substantially larger at 48 h than at 24 h (Fig. 5B and C). This observation may be in agreement with a larger accumulation of mutations during larger number of replication cycles taking place during 48 h.",

Previous studies on unrelated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) suggested that the efficacy of lethal mutagenesis can be affected by the viral load; hence, extinction will be favored when the infection is initiated with a lower viral dose (33). Thus, we decided to investigate whether passages at a lower infectious dose may also facilitate USUV extinction. We found that all three ribonucleoside analogues (800 \u03bcM) can reproducibly drive USUV to extinction in four independent replicas when a 10-fold dilution was applied before each transfer (Fig. 6B). Viral sample dilution during sequential passages in the absence of drugs or in the presence of decitabine did not affect infectivity (virus titers in the range of 106 to 108 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50] per ml; Fig. 6B). When drugs were used at a lower concentration (400 \u03bcM), the complete elimination of USUV was only observed in some sporadic cases. Both ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil caused USUV extinction in two out of three lineages, while favipiravir never led to the complete loss of infectivity in any of three series analyzed (not shown). Further analysis revealed that treatment with 5-fluorouracil resulted in significantly larger decreases in virus titers than passages in the presence of other drugs at 400 \u03bcM (Fig. 5C; at passage 3, P < 0.01 for ribavirin versus 5-fluorouracil, and P < 0.001 for ribavirin versus favipiravir, 2-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]).",

Since treatment at high concentrations (400 and 800 \u03bcM) resulted in a rapid loss of ZIKV infectivity, we isolated and analyzed viral RNA from the supernatant of infected cells after 5 consecutive passages during exposure to drugs at 200 \u03bcM (Fig. 3 and 7). Both favipiravir- and ribavirin-treated virus populations displayed significantly higher mutation frequencies (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney test for the distribution of mutations per clone) than those untreated or isolated after treatment with 5-fluorouracil or decitabine. These results are in agreement with the relative antiviral efficacy of each nucleoside drug (Fig. 3 and 7A). The highest mutation frequencies were observed in the ribavirin- and favipiravir-treated ZIKV population (7- and 4-fold higher than in untreated virus, respectively). This positively links antiviral activity with mutagenesis, as the largest decreases in ZIKV titers observed during serial passages in the presence of each drug (at 200 \u03bcM) were observed with ribavirin and favipiravir (Fig. 3B and E and 7A). In the 5-fluorouracil-treated population, we only found a modest (2-fold) increase in the mutation frequency (Fig. 7A), reflecting the milder antiviral behavior of this compound.

The only exception to these typical transition mutational patterns was obtained in ZIKV populations treated with ribavirin (Table 1), with higher frequencies in A-to-G and U-to-C nucleotide substitutions (when the [A-to-G + U-to-C]/[G-to-A + C-to-U] ratio is 2).

Several lines of evidence sustain that the antiviral properties of ribavirin and favipiravir in vivo can be, at least in part, connected to their mutagenic activity (25, 26, 50). These data encourage further study on the development of antiviral compounds with reduced toxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, and higher specificity for the viral polymerases (25, 26, 50). In this study, we have investigated the sensitivity to mutagenesis of two flaviviruses that have recently emerged as serious threats to public health, ZIKV and USUV. Both pathogens were highly sensitive to the exposure of three mutagenic nucleosides, i.e., 5-fluorouracil, favipiravir, and ribavirin, although they exhibited different degrees of susceptibility to them. ZIKV was inhibited more efficiently by ribavirin and favipiravir, while USUV replication was affected to a greater extent by 5-fluorouracil. These inhibition profiles correlate with the relative increase in the mutation frequencies observed in populations rescued after treatment, supporting the idea that their antiviral efficacy is closely associated with their mutagenic activity.",

As for other RNA viruses, flavivirus genome replication is an error-prone process catalyzed by the viral polymerase contained in the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) (64, 73\u201377). Even though further analysis is needed to confirm this possibility, our data suggest that ZIKV is more prone to misincorporate purine analogues, such as ribavirin and favipiravir, while USUV shows a preference for pyrimidine substrates, like 5-fluorouracil. If certain, this information could be instrumental in the rational screening of nucleoside analogues to effectively control each flavivirus. Many recent studies have contributed to the better understanding of the molecular biology of ZIKV replication, including the structural and biochemical characterization of the viral polymerase NS5 (74\u201378). However, there is limited knowledge on USUV replication, with no molecular data on its viral polymerase. Future studies are thus needed to elucidate the molecular determinants responsible for the different sensitivities of these flaviviruses to mutagenic nucleosides.",

We observed the typical dominance of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in USUV and an unexpected prevalence of the opposite transition types in ZIKV (the [G-to-A + C-to-U]/[A-to-G + U-to-C] ratios were 4 and 0.5 for USUV and ZIKV, respectively). It has been suggested that the larger proportion of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in viruses treated with ribavirin (included USUV) is possibly connected to the additive effect of mutagenesis by incorporation of ribavirin-triphosphate into viral RNA and depleted intracellular GTP pools as a consequence of inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition by ribavirin (69, 79, 80). Although ribavirin-triphosphate is efficiently incorporated during viral RNA synthesis opposite to U and C, in such a low intracellular GTP concentration scenario, it may be preferentially incorporated opposite to C, hence leading to those biases (79). The dominance of A-to-G and U-to-C mutations in ribavirin-treated ZIKV populations suggests that its polymerase may be favoring a different base pairing behavior of ribavirin than in other viruses with independence on intracellular nucleotide pools. Other plausible scenarios may include differences in host cell rearrangements that indirectly affect virus mutability by the same drugs (e.g., alterations in the expression of cellular proteins associated with nucleotide uptake and its metabolism). Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying these differences.",

Mutagenic drugs seem to be especially effective against persistent infections, with major evidences of lethal mutagenesis obtained during treatment of chronically infected hosts, i.e., HCV-infected patients treated with ribavirin, and mice persistently infected with norovirus and treated with favipiravir (25, 50). A tentative explanation for the better efficacy of mutagenic drugs in this context may be linked to potentially larger accumulation of mutations during longer periods of exposure to drugs (68, 84). A vast range of flavivirus-associated disorders have been connected with persistent infection, including ZIKV (8, 81\u201383, 85). ZIKV infects a broad range of cell types and tissues, including the reproductive tract and the central nervous system (8, 82, 85). Persistent replication in these tissues has been connected to diverse severe conditions, such as end-organ disease, platelet-related illness, and potentially blinding uveitis (8). Persistent ZIKV in the reproductive tissue is possibly responsible for a growing number of cases of sexually transmitted disease, with some studies predicting that this may become a major route of infection in the future (10, 86\u201392). Vaginal mucosa infection has also been related to fetal infection, further highlighting the impact of ZIKV persistence in the genital tract (9, 93). It is therefore tempting to investigate the potential therapeutic value of lethal mutagenesis in the treatment of persistent infection in the reproductive tract mucosa.",

While some studies demonstrate that ZIKV replication remains unaffected by these drugs in stem cell-derived neurons, other investigations have proven their inhibitory activity during the treatment of neural progenitor cell lines (59, 60). The different efficacies of these molecules could be linked to possible divergences in the cellular uptake or metabolism of nucleoside drugs in these cell lines. Thus, for the control of neurotropic disease, it would be desirable to identify mutagenic compounds with improved pharmacological properties in the CNS. Alternatively, a combination of mutagenic drugs that are effective in controlling the infection outside the CNS (favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil), together with effective inhibitors in the neuronal tissue (60, 94\u201396), could lead to improved approaches to control ZIKV hidden in different body compartments.",

Although severe disease in humans is rare, there is growing evidence that cases of neurologic disorders associated with USUV have been historically misdiagnosed as WNV (22, 97). The diagnosis of disease caused by USUV is further complicated by the resemblance of pathology to WNV cases and the serological cross-reactivity in diagnostic tests (11, 13, 18, 22\u201324, 97, 98). A mouse model for USUV infection has been recently established, and it represents a valuable tool to test the in vivo antiviral effect of 5-fluorouracil or novel antivirals (98, 99). These studies can be extended to the potential treatment of severe disease caused by closely related flaviviruses, such as WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus, for which antiviral therapies are not available.",

Briefly, 4 \u03bcl of purified RNA was reverse transcribed in 20 \u03bcl final volume using SuperScript III (Roche), as indicated by the manufacturer. Three microliters of cDNA was then PCR amplified using high-fidelity KOD polymerase (Toyobo). To this aim, we used primers spanning genomic positions 2976 to 3009 and 5052 to 5074 in USUV and 6465 to 6486 and 7646 to 7677 in ZIKV. PCR products were gel purified using the PureLink Quick gel extraction kit (Invitrogen) and then ligated into plasmid PCR Blunt using the Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher). Positive E. coli colonies were identified by PCR screening with primers flanking the vector-cloning site and DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher). The resulting PCR products, corresponding to individual ZIKV or USUV cDNA clones, were Sanger sequenced and the mutation frequency in each population calculated.",
