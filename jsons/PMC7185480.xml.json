            "text": "Twitter corpora in different languages provide us with an opportunity to analyze the perception of and reaction to disease outbreaks among different populations. Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to communicate in different languages. According to Statistica, there were 328 million monthly active Twitter users worldwide in 2017 [3]; two-thirds of Twitter accounts were outside the US [4]; and Twitter supported 35 or more languages [5]. The transnational nature of Twitter as a social media platform where users of different linguo-cultural backgrounds can react to the same event online in real time presents us with an opportunity in which we can examine some of the hidden assumptions of social media public health literature. Many analyses of Twitter data in public health literature only studied tweets written in English. For example, a recent systematic review on social media studies about Ebola found that all seven studies on Twitter data about Ebola covered English tweets only [6]. In a recent paper on Twitter data about Zika, while the authors studied the trends of Zika-related tweets in English, Spanish and Portuguese, respectively, they limited their content analysis to English language tweets given their own language limitation [7]. However, health-related English language Twitter content may not be generalizable to Twitter content in other languages. The assumed \u2018global\u2019 nature of Twitter and the analysis of a monolingual corpus of Twitter data mask the underlying diverse nature of the different linguo-cultural groups of users who communicate on Twitter using different languages [8]. We contend that it is essentially an Anglophone-centric paradigm with a hidden language bias towards English [9].",

We used the \u03c7\n2 feature selection algorithm (1) to evaluate how strong the evidence is for the hypothesis that the frequency of a word (or any other item) was different between the two corpora of tweets (such as Japanese versus non-Japanese), and (2) to rank the terms by \u03c7\n2 value that measured the extent of difference between the observed count and the expected count, assuming that the item's occurrence was independent of the corpus of tweets. A high \u03c7\n2 value indicates strong evidence for the existence of a difference between the item's observed frequency and its expected frequency, and therefore, its particularity to a specific corpus.",

Another feature of the Japanese corpus is the anti-Korean sentiment. The feature selection result of Thai tweets reveals that there were a few K-pop related posts, which can be informed by the keyword \u2018fan\u2019 and \u2018EXO\u2019.
