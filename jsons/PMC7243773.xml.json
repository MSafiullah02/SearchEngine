Antibody testing established that all 8 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, respiratory symptoms were not present in all cases. In Bergamo province, Italy, 10 cases of a Kawasaki-like disease were identified during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; this was a monthly incidence of at least 30 times greater than the average of 3 per month over the previous 5 years, an increase that clearly began after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the Bergamo area [21]. The researchers suggested that one of the coronaviruses might trigger Kawasaki disease because SARS-CoV-2 is a particularly virulent strain that can elicit a powerful immune response in the host. Among 48 children from 46 pediatric intensive care units in North America, in the US (none in Canada) enrolled in a 2-week study, 40 (83%) had preexisting underlying medical conditions, 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms, and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Hospital mortality was 4.2% (2 of 48) [22].",

However, other media reports, including some from South Korea, Italy, and Iceland, where testing has been more widespread, mentioned lower infection rates among children than among adults. Some Chinese studies also support the possibility that children are less susceptible to infection. One analyzed data from contact tracing in the Province of Hunan, China [24]. For every infected child under the age of 15 years, almost 3 adults between the ages of 20 and 64 were infected (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.49). A preliminary analysis of 300 infected children found that they produced much lower concentrations of cytokines than did infected adults. Cytokines are proteins released by the immune system; a fact consistent with Kawasaki disease as a condition associated with acquired immune dysfunction. Cytokines depress heart function through direct immune activation which can be associated with myocytolysis.",

In some children with COVID-19 disease, enlarged coronary arteries and aneurysms may contribute to blood clots [32]. Some children have had coronary artery aneurysms. The number of similar cases\u2014including several deaths\u2014has been increasing in other parts of Europe, although the cause of these aneurysms is not well-understood [33]. Reports also commonly describe elevated serum biomarker concentrations for inflammation [34]. Cytokines depress heart function through direct immune activation that can be associated with myocytolysis. Most children have responded to high doses of aspirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and cytokine blockers [35]. Evidence from Europe suggests most children will recover with evidence-based critical and supportive care, although at least one 14-year-old boy in London has died [20].",

The offending agents trigger an immune response, resulting in myocardial edema that eventually impairs systolic and diastolic ventricular function. Although Coxsackie B disease is not usually fatal, the reoccurrence rate is 20%, and heart damage is typically permanent [40].

One study found that 2 (9%) of 21 children with presumed to have viral-induced myocarditis had dead and dying heart muscle similar to that found after an acute infarction that responded to repeated, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin [49]. Nonspecific biomarkers of inflammation (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are often elevated in viral myocarditis [50]. Elevated blood concentrations of cardiac troponins T and I are markers of cardiomyocyte damage or death and have been reported in substantial numbers of children with myocarditis [[51], [52], [53]]. When symptoms repeated over several clinical episodes, many children show a \u201cburned out\u201d myocardium with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy [54]; nevertheless, myocarditis can have an ominous prognosis in newborns. Mortality when Coxsackievirus B is the suspected pathogen can be as high as 75% [55]. Mortality is less than 25% in older children, and another 25% will have chronic symptoms of heart failure. Recovery is complete in half of children with myocarditis [56].",

Assessing the global risk of developing symptomatic cardiovascular disease by using Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth coronary arteries and abdominal aorta risk scores calculated by measuring a combination of modifiable risk factors, along with other surrogate markers of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, are more informative than assessing systolic ventricular performance alone [67]. For example, although antiviral therapy increases LV systolic performance in virus-exposed or infected children, it can also result in long-term diastolic dysfunction [68], as well as other major persistent or progressive cardiovascular issues. One of the remarkable outcomes is that these hearts often remain too small for the body as these children grow, perhaps because of the stunting effects of viral replication leading to stunting of cardiac growth [69,70], which may eventually be associated with premature symptomatic cardiovascular diseases.",

Antiviral therapy-associated cardiotoxicity in these children is not a class effect. Rather, specific antiviral therapies can have more deleterious effects on cardiovascular structure and function [73], allowing antiviral therapy to be tailored to achieve the greatest efficacy while minimizing cardiovascular toxicity. Several over-the-counter medications have been removed from the market, because they can increase the risk of QT-prolongation, which is associated with sudden death in children with myocarditis and other heart damage [74].

With data from a registry, we recently developed a new classification system for pediatric myocardial diseases [78] by identifying differences in the course and outcomes specific to the causes of several cardiomyopathies [79]. Competing-risk analyses established that children with suspected myocarditis have outcomes similar to those in children with histologically proven myocarditis, a finding that can avoid the risks of biopsy. Although echocardiograms of children with myocarditis may be similar to those with dilated cardiomyopathy, their course and outcomes differ, which may help manage COVID-10 cardiac disease [54].",

In the current climate with the COVID-19 pandemic there is significant concern among all clinicians around the potential consequences of being infected, including history of immune suppression, diabetes, heart disease, and also seems to have an increased effect in the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community due to the excess deaths faced by this cohort [80,81]. Several groups around the world are recommending to risk stratify healthcare workers as a way to best protect healthcare workers that are most at risk of getting infected [82]. Related, the coronavirus pandemic has greatly affected how echocardiograms are acquired in the intensive care unit and perioperative settings. Careful consideration of the indications, venues, and approaches for echocardiographic imaging will protect healthcare providers, and preserve the operational integrity of health systems [83]. Echocardiography personnel can be further protected by carefully reassigning those at increased risk for infection, such as advanced age, chronic conditions, immunosuppression, and pregnancy [84].",

A recent study examined upper and lower airway cells for the expression of ACE2, the gene that codes for the receptor that the coronavirus uses to infect cells [87]. Preliminary evidence suggests that an allergy paradoxically may reduce the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease. In both children and adults, respiratory allergy, asthma, and controlled allergen exposure were associated with greatly reduced ACE2 expression. The expression of ACE2 was lowest in people with more severe asthma and a higher sensitivity to allergens.",

Yet for these young children, cardiac involvement was clinically unsuspected [100]. \u201cIf you don't look for it, you may not find it.\u201d Further, some of these cardiac biomarkers are validated predictors of long-term cardiovascular health or disease in children, which better informs treatment decisions in high-risk groups [101].

Peer to peer, \u201chorizontal learning\u201d that brings researchers, clinicians, and policy makers together to create a \u201ccommunity of practice\u201d is an innovative and comprehensive approach to pediatric multidisciplinary \u201caction research.\u201d The resulting learning collaboration can be powerful tool to improve COVID-19 learning [103]. Multi-stakeholder collaborations and authentic learning partnerships can address the tempo of learning from the widespread care of all children with COVID-19 while reducing harmful and unscientific variations in COVID-19 cardiac care [104]. Evidence has shown that creating this \u201ccommunity of practice\u201d builds trust, shares knowledge, and generates empirical evidence to use and disseminate innovative quality-improvement initiatives to improve communication, coordination, and clinical teamwork [105]. The approach represents a fundamental paradigm shift in that it actively seeks to bridge disciplinary silos and to address knowledge gaps within and across COVID-19 care delivery system [106]. Such an approach can support the creation of an integrated research and implementation continuum, stretching from prehospital care to long-term wellness that can transform the care delivery services and spread innovation and uptake [107].a.Agree on Definitions and Data Collection. We need to obtain consensus on common diagnostic definitions and to ensure their widespread and consistent use by providers, public health officials, and policymakers [108,109].b.Identify and Validate Surrogate Endpoints. Conducting trials in children with heart failure is challenging because selecting and interpreting study endpoints to evaluate policy and service interventions remain contested [110]. Many studies of these children have tested the utility of serum biomarkers, imaging studies, and disease severity as surrogate endpoints. Although such endpoints have been proven useful for risk stratification, none have been validated as predictors of \u201chard\u201d clinical endpoints in this population [111,112].\nc.Fund and Support Cardiac Registries. A global pediatric COVID-19 cardiac registry of patient characteristics and outcomes [113], modeled, for example, after the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry, should be established as soon as possible. Similar pediatric registries have proven their value in understanding and treating diseases in children [114].\n2.Health Policy Funding Priorities. Funding needs to be increased substantially for pediatric public health; test development, supplies, and personal protective equipment; and for the routine application of serological testing, once available and well-validated, in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. At the same time, targeted funding for COVID-19 pediatric cardiac injury research is needed to support longitudinal studies of immune response and risk of re-infection [115,116].\n3.Better Child Screening. Large, high-quality population studies are needed. Symptomatic children should be tested for COVID-19 infection and for serum concentrations of cardiac troponin and NT-proBNP to screen for occult cardiac involvement.\n4.Protecting Health Care Workers. The safety and wellness of health-care workers must be ensured. Data from China [117], Italy, Spain, Italy, UK [118], Mexico, and the US show that tens of thousands of responding health-care workers have been infected and hundreds have died [119]. In the UK and the US, most healthcare workers who have died have come from black, Hispanic and Asian backgrounds [81]. Reports from medical staff describe physical and mental exhaustion, the torment of difficult triage decisions, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues, all in addition to the ever-present risk of potentially fatal infection. Assuring adequate availability of personal protective equipment is just the first step; other measures must be considered, including cancelling of non-essential medical care and group events to concentrate resources and providing food, rest, and personal and family psychological support [120]. In any pandemic, health-care workers are every country's most valuable resource.\n5.Virtual Care is the Future. The movement toward virtual visits aims to protect children, their families, and healthcare workers from exposure to COVID-19, so eliminating as much in-person traffic and contact as possible at hospital and clinics is essential. Telemedicine is not new, but the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis has forced most healthcare organizations to make radical shifts to telehealth within a few weeks, transitioning most appointments to a telemedicine platform. Using appropriately software, clinicians can carefully triage upcoming appointments to select children most appropriate for telemedicine visits and those who should be seen in person, such as patients who need to come in for chemotherapy infusions. We need to better understand how and when to best use patient-facing digital health technologies and how these technologies influence the quality, safety, and satisfaction of children and their families [121].\n6.Inequity. Pediatricians, health service researchers, and policy makers are not at all surprised to read headlines about the disproportionately high numbers of COVID-19 deaths among the poor, underrepresented minorities (black and minority ethnic backgrounds) and people who are in nursing homes, marginalized and homeless, incarcerated, highly religious, and indigenous. Unfortunately, the number of minority healthcare providers and social workers that have been infected and died is also disproportionally high [81]. It is time to commit the resources and political will to address inequalities in care, especially among children.\n",
