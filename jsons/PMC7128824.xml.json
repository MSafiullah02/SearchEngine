The genome (Fig. 1\n) consists of linear double-stranded DNA varying between 26 and 45 kilobase pairs (kbp) depending upon the species (Van Regenmortel et al., 2000, for review see Shenk, 1996). The Adenovirus family has recently been divided into four genera, the Mastadeno, Atadeno, Aviadeno and Siadenoviruses (Pringle, 1998; Van Regenmortel et al., 2000; B\u00fcchen-Osmond, 2003). Mastadenoviruses infect only mammals and the Aviadenoviruses infect only avian species. However, specific members of the third and fourth genera have been shown to infect either mammals, birds, amphibians or reptiles. Analysis of genome arrangements and DNA sequence data has brought about this recent distinction of the Atadeno and Siadenoviruses. Bovine adenovirus (BAV) serotypes 4\u20138, ovine adenovirus (OAV) isolate 287 and egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus are all included in the Atadeno genus with Frog adenovirus 1 and Turkey adenovirus A placed in the Siadenovirus genus (Benk\u00f6 and Harrach, 1998; Benk\u00f5 et al., 2000; B\u00fcchen-Osmond, 2003).",

Since then the presence of PAdV in swine has been demonstrated virtually worldwide by virus isolation and serological surveys (Derbyshire, 1989). Depending upon serotype, PAdV can be grown in pig kidney, testis, retina and thyroid cells and in human kidney, canine melanoma and calf kidney cells (Dea and Elazhary, 1984; Kasza, 1966; Mayr et al., 1967). There are at least five serotypes of PAdV circulating in domestic pig populations internationally (Clarke et al., 1967; Derbyshire et al., 1975; Nagy et al., 2001), with two further serotypes apparently identified in Japan (Kadoi, 1997; Kadoi et al., 1997).",

Notably, it has also been isolated from apparently healthy pigs with no clinical disease (Derbyshire et al., 1966; Mahnel and Bibrack, 1966; Rasmussen, 1969). Since most infections with PAdV are asymptomatic in pigs, it is not considered to be of economic importance in the pig industry. Porcine adenovirus has been isolated only from swine with no other hosts described, and it is probable that husbandry practices maintaining production pigs in close contact may facilitate the maintenance of PAdV in the herd via faecal\u2013oral transmission.",

Expression of the foreign gene was directed by the viral major late promoter (MLP) which is the strongest adenoviral promoter. The porcine adenovirus MLP and tri-partite leader (TPL) sequences required for directing high levels of foreign gene expression were cloned and inserted into a PAdV expression vector. Foreign genes to be expressed were inserted between these elements and the SV40 PolyA signal sequence. The expression cassette was inserted into the right-hand end of the PAdV genome by homologous recombination and correct orientation confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Hammond et al., 2000). Using this method, no deletions in the PAdV genome are made resulting in the production of a fully replication competent recombinant virus, which may be an important consideration where the recombinant is to be used in outbred swine that may have had prior exposure to PAdV. The insertion made into our first rPAdV which included the E2/gp55 gene from classical swine fever virus (rPAdV-gp55) increased the genome length to 106.8% of wild type and exceeded the expected maximum insert size for a stable Mastadeno virus recombinant by almost 2% (Hammond et al., 2000). An even larger recombinant PAdV has since been constructed with a total genome size of 109.6% (Tuboly et al., 2001), however, prior to insertion of foreign genetic material in that case, a portion of the genome was deleted. Thus, rPAdV-gp55 contains the largest stable insertion that has been made into a non-deleted Mastadeno virus recombinant so far reported.",

It is well known that the open reading frames present in the E3 region of human adenoviruses are not required for viral replication in vitro, but they are thought to play a major role in evasion of the host anti-viral immune response (Russell, 2000). Thus deletion of this region from PAdV recombinants could significantly alter the ability of the vector to replicate in vivo and consequently compromise its ability to successfully express a foreign gene. Also, the foreign genes that have so far been inserted into the PAdV E3 region have not been coupled with a specific PAdV promoter element and have relied solely upon endogenous PAdV promoters for their expression. Use of the MLP may be essential if high levels of gene expression over a broad time period are required, since the E3 promoter functions early and is overwhelmed later in the viral replication cycle (Shenk, 1996).",

The helper independent (replication competent) rPAdV3 vector contained a gene from Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and was constructed by insertion of the gD coding sequence into the partially deleted E3 region of PAdV3 (Reddy et al., 1999b). A vaccination trial with this recombinant virus in pigs is described below (Hammond et al., 2001a). The helper dependent vector was constructed by deletion of the PAdV3 E1 region, insertion in its place of a reporter gene, Green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, with subsequent rescue of recombinant virus particles by growth in porcine cell lines expressing HAV-5 E1 proteins. This recombinant was shown to express the GFP gene, but as expected was unable to replicate in swine tissue culture cells without the provision of complementing genes from the human adenovirus E1 region. Such a vector may be of use in vaccination strategies where expression of a gene product is required, but where the spread of the vector within the host is undesirable, such as in specific targeting or gene therapy applications in non-target species rather than in swine. No animal studies have yet been published using this vector. Tuboly et al. (2001) constructed a recombinant PAdV serotype 5 expressing a portion of the S gene from Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV). Although they were not able to produce a recombinant virus that stably expressed the full length coding sequence of 4.4 kb, a recombinant virus containing a 2.2 kb fragment of the S gene was shown to express the truncated product in tissue culture. When administered orally to pigs, both serum and mucosal antibody responses to the S protein were detected. Sadly however, no TGEV challenge experiment was reported and therefore no protection data are available.",

In contrast, pigs given a single oral dose of vaccine developed clinical CSF and were euthanased. However, a significant observation from this work was that pigs given two oral doses of rPAdV-gp55 were completely protected from disease even though they did not develop CSFV specific serum neutralising antibodies prior to challenge (Hammond et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2000b). This result adds further weight to the argument that other immune mechanisms apart from serum neutralising antibodies are operating in protection from CSF, as we have previously suggested (Hammond et al., 2000, Hammond et al., 2001c). These results also demonstrate that PAdV based vaccines are effective when delivered either by injection or by the oral route.",

It is anticipated that the development of a live recombinant rPAdV-PRV vaccine would provide a safe alternative to live PRV vaccines, which, since they are infectious, maintain the problems associated with live herpes virus vectors of reversion to virulence and/or latency (Kluge et al., 1992; Mulder et al., 1997). The gD gene from PRV was inserted into the E3 region of PAdV-3 (Reddy et al., 1999b), and the resultant recombinant virus (rPAdV-gD) tested in a vaccine trial to determine protection from challenge with PRV (Hammond et al., 2001a).",

Analysis of the wbc populations of peripheral blood from day 0 when daily bleeding of pigs began, demonstrated generalised daily fluctuations across all cell types from both groups. However, treatment with rPAdV-G-CSF appeared to reduce this fluctuation with far less variation in wbc counts observed from the day of administration when compared with the untreated control group (Fig. 3). This effect was also observed following challenge with APP, where increases in wbc populations including PMNL were less substantial and more tightly constrained in treated pigs than in controls.",

The condition of all control pigs was very poor whereas all rPAdV-G-CSF treated pigs were in good condition showing no clinical signs of disease. At post-mortem, all control pigs showed large numbers of lesions in the lungs, whereas in contrast, all pigs treated with rPAdV-G-CSF had a significantly reduced lesion load (Table 2\n). A comparison of the lesion/lobe scores (Moore et al., 2001) for the two groups demonstrated that there was a substantial overall reduction of 94.5% in the clinical score for the rPAdV-G-CSF treated group compared with the un-treated controls. A group of control pigs given an equivalent dose of wild type PAdV3 vector did not show any significant reduction in lesion/lobe scores compared with untreated controls (data not shown). This significant result clearly demonstrated that a single dose of rPAdV-G-CSF was able to give considerable protection against a severe experimental challenge with APP, confirming that a recombinant PAdV expressing G-CSF is a potent inhibitor of the bacterial infection APP in pigs.",

Consequently concern has been expressed that PAdV3 would not be a suitable delivery vector due to the potential for pre-existing neutralising antibodies in swine to interfere with recombinant virus \u201ctake\u201d in the host (Nagy et al., 2001). PAdV has been isolated from a pig in Queensland, Australia (Kwon and Spradbrow, 1971) and it has previously been reported that the majority of pigs used in the rPAdV-gp55 vaccine trials in Australia were sero-positive for neutralising antibody to PAdV3 before vaccination, but that the vaccine was still effective at preventing CSF disease in those animals (Hammond et al., 2000, Hammond et al., 2001b, Hammond et al., 2001c). Subsequently, in a survey of over 700 pig sera collected from various locations around Australia, we have shown that at a single dilution of 1/8 over 90% of swine tested had specific serum neutralising antibodies to PAdV3 (Table 3\n). A more detailed analysis of a smaller sample set of these sera has shown that the titres range from 1/32 to >1/500, with the majority being >1/100 (Fig. 4\n).",

In a trial designed to address this question, nine 6-week old Large White pigs were given a s.c. injection of 1 \u00d7 106 wild type PAdV3 in order to induce specific PAdV3 neutralising antibodies. All pigs had low but specific serum neutralising antibody titres against PAdV at the start of the experiment but these increased up to >1/125 by day 35 post administration of PAdV3. Subsequently, three pigs received two doses of rPAdV-gp55 on days 21 and 42 post administration of PAdV3, respectively, three pigs received a single dose of rPAdV-gp55 on day 42 and three pigs were left un-vaccinated. The mean PAdV3 specific neutralising antibody titre of the sera from pigs given two doses of vaccine was >1/37 at the time of first vaccination (day 21) and >1/340 at the time of the second vaccination on day 42. The mean PAdV titre of those pigs given the single dose on day 42 was 1/256.

The pigs in the single dose group showed a slight increase in temperature for 2\u20133 days post challenge which then returned to normal and the pigs did not show any other signs of CSF. This was exactly the same response as had been observed previously in CSFV vaccine trials carried out in pigs that had not been given PAdV3 (Hammond et al., 2000, Hammond et al., 2001b, Hammond et al., 2001c). Pigs given two doses of rPAdV-gp55 did not develop fever nor did they show any signs of CSF. Examination of the spleens from challenged pigs demonstrated the presence of high levels of CSFV antigen in all three controls but none in any of the vaccinates. In addition, those pigs given two doses of rPAdV-gp55 showed a specific boosted level of pre-challenge CSFV neutralising antibody following the second dose of vaccine even in the face of specific neutralising antibody to the vector PAdV3. These results clearly demonstrate that recombinant PAdV serotype 3 is an extremely efficient vector for the delivery of vaccine antigens to swine, and that its efficacy is not inhibited by the presence of serotype specific neutralising antibody in outbred pigs.",

This appears to be the case even if administered in the presence of considerable levels of specific neutralising antibody to the vector in the potential target host. For use as a delivery vector for therapeutic molecules, large scale trials will determine whether rPAdV-cytokine treatment of production animals can succeed as a natural replacement for in-feed antibiotics.
