The issue is particularly relevant in a time when a large 5 number of elderly subjects, who lived in nursing homes, died England and Wales Court of Appeal considered prevailing the interest 73 of Jodie since Marie was self-designated for a very early death. 74 We are aware that even the case-by-case criterion cannot 75 ultimately avoid discrimination, for example when dealing with 76 patients with similar chances of recovery. In such case, inevitably the 77 \"first come, first served\" rule is in force, a seemingly impersonal fact 78 that is not however a value judgment. ",

However, liberal democracies are not well equipped 13 for this challenge. The Italian constitution, for example, states \"the 14 Republic safeguards health as a fundamental right of the individual 15 and as a collective interest\" (art.32). Given that \"all citizens have 16 equal social status and are equal before the law, without regard to their 17 sex, race, language, religion, political opinions, and personal or social 18 conditions\", as the constitution also states (art.3), it follows that no 19 juridical criteria can be adopted that discriminates among individuals 20 with regard to their right to health. For examples, where health care is mainly private, those with 37 resources pay for what they need. Individuals without resources, like 38 people living in countries where health care is public, are faced with a 39 predicament that cannot be resolved by guidelines and bureaucratic 40 protocols.

Is the right to care different for a person who has recently 48 acquired citizenship compared to an individual from a family that has 49 paid into the health care system for decades? Who has priority, the 50 citizen or a non-citizen who does not pay taxes? Remaining in the 51 perspective of maximizing benefit, is it right to not consider the social 52 contribution one person can make compared to another?
