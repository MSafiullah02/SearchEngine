The current available data, however, do not provide detailed information of the association between arsenic exposure and influenza infection. The resulting uncertainty in arsenic\u2010associated influenza infections thus poses a fundamental challenge to quantifying and modeling the linkage of arsenic and influenza.

Here we used the difference between maximum and minimum RSS (\u0394RSS = RSSmax\u2212RSSmin) to indicate the potential exacerbations risk of lung function induced by chronic arsenic exposure and A (H1N1) infection (Table III). It is not surprising that the regions of Taiwan, West Bengal (India), and the United States subjected to relatively higher arsenic levels in drinking water had larger changes in RSS at day 2 after infection compared with Brazil and Mexico. Meanwhile, RSS values in West Bengal and the United States ranged from 0.21 to 0.29 compared with Brazil and Mexico, which had less change in RSS of 0.07 and 0.12, respectively (Table III).",

Therefore, we recommended that the future research could focus on more evaluations of the interaction of arsenic with other interference factors or infectious respiratory diseases (like tuberculosis) commonly found in the arsenic prevalence areas. Looking forward, it is a vital health need to identify environmental risk factors that exacerbate influenza and possibly other respiratory infections, helping to minimize the impact of potential pandemic outbreaks in the future. It is thus needed to conduct more studies to determine the causal relationships of virus\u2010chemical interactions in water and human disease and to assess the role of other waterborne chemical carcinogens related to infectious diseases manifestation.(\n\n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n\n) Our findings suggested that avoidance of drinking arsenic\u2010containing water could reduce influenza respiratory illness and that need will become increasingly urgent as the novel H1N1 pandemic influenza virus infects people worldwide.(\n\n45\n, \n46\n\n)\n",
