The dynamics is governed by a single functional delay differential equation, which, in the case of a large population, can be solved exactly, even in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate. This delay model has a higher degree of accuracy than the so-called SIR model, commonly used in epidemiology, which, instead, is formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations. We apply our model to describe the outbreak of the new virus COVID-19 in Italy, taking into account the containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the spreading of the virus and the social costs for the population.",

Italy is one of the hardest hit countries suffering from the very dramatic consequences of this disease. The outbreak of the virus, the new coronavirus which caused the infection, seems out of our control. In the absence of a therapy and a vaccine, social distancing measures and a strict lockdown appear to be the most effective means to contain the growth of the infection. We should remind that there are places in the world where often infectious diseases, also those already defeated in the so-called more developed countries, can still cause very severe consequences among the local populations.",

The aim of this work is, therefore, to provide a simple handy model for epidemic spreading, which could depend only on the couple of parameters which generally characterize an infectious disease: the infection rate and the infectiousness (or recovery) time. Both these quantities can be taken from the experience, therefore, we do not need further parameters to fit the data which could cause artificial predictions. We will show that the model we are presenting have the same, or even higher, predictive power than that of one of the most widely used technique in epidemiology, the SIR model [1] [2] [3] . This latter model requires the presence of a fictitious recovery rate related to the number of recovered persons, without considering that the new cases of recovery (and fatality) come from infected cases occurring a period of time earlier. The model we are proposing, instead, is based on the fact that the closed cases come from the infected ones after an average delay recovery time, therefore, contrary to the SIR model, formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations, it is described by just a single equation, a functional retarded differential equation, bringing predictions more under control. In this work we derive the exact analytical solution of this model in the limit of large population number, also in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate, which is the case when containment measures are implemented in order to reduce the spreading of the infection. Moreover, the definition of the so-called basic reproduction number R 0 (a parameter determining whether a infectious disease can spread or not) comes out naturally in our delay model.",

At the time being, even if the situation in Italy is improving, it seems that more efforts are needed in order to change course and rapidly stop the spreading of the disease. Further measures might be useful, like, for instance, i) running more diagnostic tests, at least, on all the doctors and medical workers who are in contact with many patients, ii) improving the food distribution to avoid the crowding in the food shops and to ensure subsistence goods also to those who need, iii) providing medical devices like surgical masks to all the population.",

The so-called SIR model is one of the most used techniques for describing the spreading in time of an infection disease. According to this model the population is divided into three parts represented by the number of susceptible S(t), infected I(t) and recovered R(t) individuals which vary over time (see Appendix B). This model, is almost equivalent to our simpler model, Eq. (3)-(4). However a criticism which can be raised against the SIR model is related to the fact that, being formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations, the model requires the presence of an effective recovery (and fatality) rate which might not correspond to the actual rate since the new cases of recovery (and fatality) come from infected cases occurring a few days earlier. For that reason, instead of writing the problem in terms of ordinary differential equations one has to do it in terms of functional differential equations.",

Fixing the average of recovery and fatality time \u03b4t, the basic reproduction number is also a function of time according to R 0 = r(t)\u03b4t, with a profile shown in Fig. 2 . Solving Eq. (16), or, analogously, using the recursive relation in Eq. (15), with the time-dependent rate r(t) given by Eq. (17), fixed by the parameters producing the profile depicted in Fig. 2 , we obtain the solution F (t) which slowly goes to saturation over time, in perfect agreement with the data for the total number of confirmed infected cases, as shown by Fig. 3 , where the blue line is the expected curve, while the red points are the official data. The dotted gray lines in Fig. 3 represent F (t) if the containment measures had not been taken. As one can see from Figs. 2-3, only when R 0 becomes smaller than 1, the curve flattens allowing for a stop of the epidemic spreading, avoiding that a large part of the population gets infected. For R 0 1, F (t) would increase linearly, and I(t) would become almost constant, meaning that the number of new infections would be equal to the number of closed cases. A reliable forecast has to take into account the fact that the official data of infectious cases are made by counting mostly the symptomatic cases, probably discarding other infectious cases which could transfer the virus even without or with mild symptoms. Moreover, the data of both the total number of infected persons and that of the recovered ones could be affected by the procedure, the realization times and the number of the diagnostic tests. However, since our model relies on the infectiousness time, it does not need a fitting of the data for recovered persons which may be affected by systematic errors. This uncertainty on the data for closed cases would compromise the result for the SIR model. On the contrary, our theoretical prediction based on the delay model agrees fairly well with the data-set for total infected cases, as shown in Fig. 3 . As a final remark we remind that most of the confirmed infected cases in Italy are counted after the appearance of the symptoms and the persons who exhibit severe ones are mostly hospitalized, and then counted as infected persons. Some of them, unfortunately, die approximately 4 days after (therefore after approximately 9 days form the onset of the first symptoms, as reported by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, www.iss.it). We observe that, splitting the closed cases between real recovered persons, R R , and dead persons, R D ,",

This observation allows us to formulate the problem in terms of a single functional differential equation depending on two well defined clinically relevant parameters: the infection rate and the infectiousness time. We provide the exact analytical solution for such an equation, in the limit of large population number, finding that it depends exclusively on the basic reproduction number R 0 = r\u03b4t, see Eq. (8). We derive the analytic solution also in the presence of a generic time-dependent infection rate. We apply our model to the case of the spreading of Covid-19 in Italy, allowing the infection rate to vary in time, as a result of some containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the consequences of the infection on the population. We find perfect agreement between the official data and the expected theoretical results. In general terms, the basic reproduction number should be suppressed well below 1 in order to rapidly recover the initial condition. By a rough estimation, in order to have a decline of the infection as fast as its growth, containment measures or possible therapies should be so effective to reduce the basic reproduction number and reach the final value R 0f such that R 0f",
