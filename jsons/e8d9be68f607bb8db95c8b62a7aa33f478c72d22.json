Virus rejection was investigated by PVDF and PP membrane modules, with the pore sizes of 0.22 and 0.1 \u03bcm, respectively. In tap water system, 2.1 lg rejection of coliphage T4 could be achieved by PVDF membrane compared with complete rejection by PP membrane, while for coliphage f2 with smaller diameter, 0.3-0.5 lg rejection of the influent virus was removed by the two membranes. In domestic wastewater system, cake layer and gel layer on the membrane surface changed the cut-off size of the membrane so that there was no significant difference between PP and PVDF for each coliphage. The removal ratios of coliphage T4 and f2 in the MBR were more than 5.5 and 3.0 lg, respectively. Compared with 5.5 lg removal for virus T4 in the MBR system, only 2.1 lg (96.8%-99.9%) removal rate was observed in the conventional activated sludge system with the influent virus concentration fluctuating from 1830 to 57000 PFU/mL. Only 0.8%-22% virus removal was the effect of adsorption to activated sludge, which showed a decreasing tendency with the retention time, while 75%-98% was the effect of virus inactivation by microbial activity. It indicated that the major mechanism of virus removal was not the transfer of viruses from the water phase to the sludge phase but inactivation in the biological treatment process.

These pollutants often enter surface waters from diffuse or non-point sources associated with surface runoff and from point sources typically associated with concentrated farming activities, such as the production of livestock. However, most discharge guidelines regulate bacterial indicators, but not viral indicators, let alone specific pathogens. For example, the existing discharge standard for hospital effluents lays emphasis on bacteriological indicators, such as the number of coliform groups, pathogenic enterobacteria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc. As for the behavior of viruses, the re-lated information is very limited.

Conventional wastewater treatment technology cannot completely remove or inactivate enteric viruses. Recently, membrane bioreactor (MBR) has received increasing attention in the past two decades as advanced wastewater treatment alternatives [3] [4] [5] . MBR is a modification of the activated sludge process in which separation of solids is achieved without the requirement of a secondary clarifier. Instead, that this function is carried out by a membrane, which retains the particulate phase within the reactor and allows the treated clarified effluent to the next process. Rejections of membrane include biological and non-biological colloids and macromolecules, resulting in an effluent free from pathogenic microorganisms [5] . In previous studies, MBR showed extreme efficiency in the removal of bacteria [5] [6] [7] [8] .

Two viruses with bacterial hosts (coliphages), T4 and f2, were used in this research as surrogates for human enteroviruses to assess the MBR's efficiency in virus removal [11] [12] [13] . It is mainly because of the following: (1) The coliphage f2 is similar to Poliovirus\uff0c Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, Norwalk agent and Hepatitis A virus, while T4 is similar to Adenovirus, Reovirus and Rotavirus (Table 1) ; (2) it is non-pathogenic to humans and can be seeded with a high concentration in tracer experiments; (3) they have good survival characteristics, and can represent the actual removal mechanism occurring in sewage treatment work; and (4) the assay is simple and rapid.",

Viruses T4, slightly larger than 100 nm in size (107.9\u00b112.9 nm), were tested by PP membrane. As expected, viruses T4 were retained by the PP membrane to the limits of assay detection. Compared with complete rejection by PP membrane, 2.1 lg rejection could be achieved by PVDF membrane with the mean pore sizes of 220 nm. Although the diameter of viruses f2 (25\u00b11 nm) was significantly smaller than the membrane pores, it was found that 48%-70% (0.3-0.5 lg) of the influent virus was rejected in membrane separation processes. Table 2 described virus rejection by the two membrane modules during the trials. Generally, the mechanism of sieve retention attributed to particulate removal in membrane filtration. In sieve retention, the porous media acts as a barrier for particle penetration. The particles are retained on the membrane surface and form a cake that grows in thickness with the filtration. The removal of virus by membranes depends on many factors including membrane pore size, virus diameter, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. In previous researches [14] [15] [16] , the ratio of virus diameter to membrane pore diameter was the most critical parameter for the retention of viruses by microfiltration and ultrafiltration. According to the mechanism of sieve retention, the rejection, R, was calculated by the following expression [17] :",

Table 2 shows that virus rejection results in the experiments were generally higher than theoretic values calculated eq. (3) with either T4 or f2. For example, the pore size of the PVDF membrane was approximately 2 times that of the diameter of virus T4. According to the prediction, about half of the viruses, particles would penetrate through the PVDF membrane. However, the virus rejection by PVDF membrane reached 99.2%. The deviation between the real rejection and the prediction by the sieve theory could be partially explained by the size distribution of pore size and virus diameter. First, the virus size and membrane pore were not identical to the nominal sizes measured by the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Scanning Electron microscope (SEM) observations. The particle sizes were not equal to the mean sizes measured by AFM observation (Figure   2(a) ). The standard deviations of the sizes of the T4 particle were calculated to be 12.9 nm. In addition, it is natural the membranes prepared by the phase inversion method have the lg-normal distribution of pore size. Membrane pore distributions, measured by SEM observation, were not identical to the nominal sizes ( Figure  3(a) ). Another possible explanation is aggregation of viruses with a high concentration. Viruses are considered as bio colloids with electrical properties governing their adsorption to biological and non-biological surfaces. Their surface electrical charges result from the ionization of carboxyl (COO \u2212 ) and amino (NH 3 + ) groups localized on the surface of their protein coat. Viruses are released from infected host cells in a highly aggregated state and they probably kept the state when entering wastewaters and natural waters. Ionic conditions prevailing in natural waters do not lead to viral dispersion, and this association is due to Brownian motion, electrostatic forces, and electrical double-layer phenomena. The microorganisms' size becomes more and more large because of viral aggregates. Thus they may be rejected when they are larger than the membrane size. The aggregation of viruses was also confirmed by the measurements. It showed that the particle size of aggregation may be 2-3 times greater than nominal virus size in Figure 2 (b). In addition, membrane structure is considered to be an important factor affecting virus transmission through the membrane. The cross section and inlet of PVDF are shown in Figure 3 . Membrane structure of PVDF was asymmetric, and the pore structure was distributed unevenly via the cross section of the membrane. The asymmetric structure was effective to reject T4. ",

Virus T4 removal was investigated during the operation of the MBR (Figure 4 ). The influent virus concentration was in a range from 10 5.8 to 10 7.4 PFU/mL. After 12 h operation, effluent virus concentration was 10 PFU/mL. 5 d later, virus concentration decreased to 1-2 PFU/ mL. There are only 50% of the samples of effluent, in which 1-2 PFU/mL viruses were detected during the continuous experiments. The PP membrane with smaller pore size has been used for the removal of viruses and high removal efficiencies have been achieved, and nearly no virus has been detected in the effluent. No significant difference was observed between both pore sizes as the effluent virus concentration was in the same order. The removal ratios of coliphage T4 in the two membrane modules were higher than 5.5 lg in both cases at steady state.",

While in activated sludge system, the rejection was 5.8 lg. It means that virus rejection by new membrane depended on size sieving of the membrane pores at beginning of the operation, but after a few hours operation in the MBR the rejection mainly depended on the dynamic layer, not on membrane itself. Dynamic layer depositing on the membrane surface changed the cut-off size of the membrane into the smaller one. In general, the formation of the dynamic layer can be divided into the two stages: cake formation at the beginning of filtration and formation of gel layer with the proceeding of microfiltration operation. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) composed of many organic compounds, such as polysaccharides, amino polysaccharides and proteins, secreted by bacteria played an important role in the formation of gel layer and enhanced microbial attachment to membrane surface. In order to measure the contributions of cake layer and gel layer in the dynamic layer on the membrane surface separately, PVDF membrane was firstly washed by clean water to detach the cake layer on the membrane fibers, and then immersed in the chemical solutions (0.7% sodium hydroxide and 2% sodium hypochlorite) to damage the EPS closely absorbed on the membrane fibers. After tap water cleaning, virus T4 concentrations of effluent increased from 0-2 PFU/mL to 400-500 PFU/mL in the tap water system, and accordingly membrane resistance decreased from 6.4 to 3.5\u00d710 \u221212 (Table 3 ).

Since chemical cleaning caused a further reduction in the value of virus rejection, it could imply that the breakage of gel layer reduced the available membrane pore during microfiltration. Studies of relative contributions in virus removal confirmed that virus rejection by cake layer was the main cause of high removal rate of coliphage T4. Membrane itself was the next largest contributor. Virus rejection by gel layer contributed less than that by both cake layer and membrane itself in the presence of tap water (Table 3) . These results proved that dynamic layer on membrane surface played an important role in removing virus. The formation of dynamic layer decreased the practical cut-off and thus prevented the filtration of virus. For PP membrane, there was no significant difference between tap water cleaning and chemical cleaning. These results proved that the small pore size was the main cause of high rejection of coliphage T4 for PP membrane (Table 4 ).",
