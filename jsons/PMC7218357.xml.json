The Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University is responsible for ENT consultation for COVID-19 patients in Shanghai assigned by the government. In response to the pandemic, the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University also quickly implemented a variety of protective strategies for ENT inpatient and outpatient care, including preappointment screening, triaging, restriction of nonurgent clinic visits and surgeries, telemedicine, and proper protective equipment. The infection status and condition of patients and their ENT providers were monitored through March 20, 2020.",

Median age was 63 years (range, 32-72 years), 11 of 20 (55%) were male, and 19 of 20 (95%) were in a severe or critical condition. Of these patients, 7 of 20 (35%) were recommended for a tracheotomy after the consultation. The median age of the tracheotomy group was 65.3 years, and all of them were critically ill with 1 or more chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and/or coronary artery disease (Table 1). Six of 7 patients ultimately underwent a tracheotomy, including 3 surgical tracheotomies (STs) and 3 percutaneous dilational tracheotomies (PDTs). The average intubation time for patients undergoing tracheotomy was 12.6 days. As of March 20, 2020, a total of 2 of 6 (33.3%) of these patients were hospitalized in improving condition, while 4 of 6 (66.7%) did not improve significantly. Three patients underwent PDT for prolonged intubation after being unable to be weaned from ventilation over 10 to 14 days. Of these patients, 2 were still hospitalized at the time of data collection and improving. The third patient presented with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, myocarditis, metabolic acidosis with decompensated respiratory acidosis, electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hyponatremia), and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. This patient was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) accompanied by intra-airway hemorrhage before tracheotomy. Ten days after tracheotomy, the patient experienced bleeding from the nose and mouth. Nineteen days after tracheotomy, obstruction of ECMO flow occurred, and the patient died after recanalization. Another 3 patients underwent ST. The first was a cerebral infarction patient with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, cerebral hernia, and anemia who underwent tracheotomy to prevent the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia. He remained in a coma after tracheotomy. Another patient experienced dyspnea after extubation, necessitating an emergent ST rather than reintubation. He was also in a coma as of the date of data collection. The third patient underwent ST because of repeated extubation and reintubation and underwent ST for the second time due to airway bleeding 9 days later. Epistaxis occurred on day 7 after the second tracheotomy, which resolved after temporary packing with nondissolvable packing for 2 days. This patient eventually died on day 10 after the second ST. Overall, outcomes after tracheotomy were mixed with 2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, and all living patients still hospitalized.",

Under the guidance of trained staff in the isolation ward, providers disposed of the waste and sharps properly and disinfected personal supplies brought out from the contaminated area after the procedures. Outer protective equipment was removed at the entrance of the semicontaminated area. The inner protective equipment was removed in the semicontaminated area and personal supplies were disinfected again.18 Furthermore, careful attention was given to proper hand hygiene and avoiding contact with the eyes, nose, and mouth. The otolaryngology health care worker was then quarantined in designated isolation locations for 14 days after the consultation. Health care workers in Wuhan and Shenzhen took their temperature 4 times every day and took nucleic acid tests twice spanning a 24-hour period.

However, the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University cares for one of the largest numbers of ENT patients in China and continued to do so throughout the pandemic. Since the announcement of obvious human-to-human transmission on January 20, 2020, the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University reduced its large number of outpatient visits immediately by eliminating nonurgent visits, stopped elective surgery, avoided upper aerodigestive tract endoscopic examinations as much as possible, developed outpatient and emergency room triage flowcharts (Figure 2), and improved staff training on infection control measures. In the preexamination areas for the emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and inpatient wards, HCWs used first-level protection measures consisting of work clothes, isolation gowns, hair cover, normal surgical masks, and gloves when necessary. Second-level protection was used in the isolation ward and third-level protection in the operating room and when performing invasive procedures. The protection level can be adjusted according to the specific type of encounter and working areas (see Table 3 for details). We developed and followed these procedures and then gradually increased outpatient appointments, tumor-related surgery, and then finally open elective surgery according to the pandemic situation. At present, our clinic and surgical volume has returned to baseline. One-fourth as many outpatient visits and one-sixth as many elective surgeries were performed from January 20, 2020, to March 20, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.

            "text": "In this clinical study of 20 COVID-19 patients seeking ENT consultation, 5 patients who had previously been endotracheally intubated were converted to a tracheotomy and 1 patient underwent a tracheotomy only. Otolaryngologists performed a tracheotomy for these patients for management of secretions, repeated endotracheal intubation, and long-term endotracheal intubation. Data from non-COVID-19 infected critically ill patients suggest that early tracheotomy (within 10 days of intubation) has been associated with more ventilator-free days, shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays, shorter duration of sedation, and lower long-term mortality rates, although other studies have found that timing of tracheotomy does not affect important clinical outcomes.19,20 In this study, 4 of the 6 patients (66.7%) who underwent tracheotomy subsequently were in a coma (2 cases) or died (2 cases), which underscores the fact that in this small patient cohort, most patients did not achieve clinical benefit from the tracheotomy performed. Another report from China also suggests against benefit from tracheotomy for COVID-19 patients.21 There are also data from the SARS treatment experience suggesting that tracheotomy was not associated with significant improved outcome.22 Tracheotomy is also associated with a number of potential complications, including tracheal bleeding. Without specific treatment for the infection, the mortality rate once a patient goes into severe or critical ARDS is as high as 70%, which also may argue against proceeding with tracheostomy on patients with COVID-related ARDS.23 Taken in combination with our clinical experience in China, we recommend that long-term intubation should not on its own be an indication for tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients, as the risk to patients and providers likely outweighs any marginal benefits in this scenario. Rather, tracheotomy should only be used in specific situations such as airway obstruction where the potential for successful extubation is otherwise compromised or in circumstances where tracheotomy placement might positively affect a patient\u2019s potential for successful weaning of minimal ventilatory support. These scenarios do require careful consideration when medical resources including ventilators are in limited supply in the setting of widespread community infection. In agreement with recent recommendations released by ENT UK, we believe such clinical situations should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary fashion such that consensus among specialists regarding potential for clinical benefit following tracheotomy as weighed against the risk of the procedure is agreed upon prior to proceeding with the procedure.24",

For this reason, it is important that health workers in ENT departments use standard precautions consistently when providing care to COVID-19 patients. Rigorous implementation and adherence are crucial for the control of outbreak situations. Based on our previous experience of performing tracheotomy during SARS, no medical or nursing staff member was infected after carrying out the procedure while taking all the precautions and wearing the appropriate protective apparel.15,22,28,29 Medical units should provide graded protection for health care workers according to the job position, work area, and the level of exposure risk.17 PPE is the most obvious aspect of infection control. PPE must be correctly selected and used in a safe manner. Based on expert consensus in China, HCWs adopted third-level protection measures when performing invasive procedures such as tracheotomy or control of bleeding. The second-level protection measures can be taken for evaluation, treatment, or throat swab sampling of patients in the isolation ward. The utilization of PPE in second-level protection and third-level protection here roughly corresponds to standard PPE and enhanced PPE, respectively, as previously described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).15,29 Wuhan was the epicenter of the pandemic, with a higher incidence of disease than Shenzhen and Shanghai. As such, during consultation of COVID-19 patients with sore throat and nasal congestion, otolaryngologists in Wuhan and Shenzhen adopted third-level and secondary-level infection control plans, respectively, with no resulting provider infections at either hospital. These clinical results suggest that the adoption of such graded protection measures is feasible and effective. Health care workers could choose different-level protection according to disease prevalence, the degree of exposure risk, and the availability of PPE. While in this study all otolaryngology providers were quarantined for 14 days after caring for COVID-19 positive patients, the ultimate lack of infection of any of these providers may indicate that such quarantine is not necessary if appropriate PPE and other infection control measures are used. Serial temperature checks and viral testing could be used instead to confirm providers are not infected without having to remove them from the workforce, a key concern given the potential volume of COVID-19 patients requiring care. Further study is necessary to determine what is the minimum sufficient level of PPE to prevent infection with COVID in different clinical scenarios.",

This can lead to high-risk exposures in the outpatient setting if high clinical suspicion is not maintained. In 1 example, a patient who was seen in the otolaryngology department for a sore throat and mild cough was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19, illustrating the importance of careful triage of outpatients.30 Some evidence also indicates that hyposmia or loss of smell may be an early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly relevant to otolaryngologists.13,14 In our cohort, there was at least 1 case of a mild severity patient who initially presented to an otolaryngologist for hyposmia. At the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, proactive implementation of a variety of protective strategies immediately at the start of the outbreak resulted in no HCW infections occurring despite high exposure risk, indicating the effectiveness of these policies. Notably, as the overall prevalence of disease stabilized, the hospital was able to increase its clinical and surgical volume back to baseline while still having no HCW infections. While this is in part a reflection of the success of national disease control measures in China, it also suggests that with proper patient screening, protective equipment, and training, even a high-risk specialty such as otolaryngology can practice safely and effectively in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
