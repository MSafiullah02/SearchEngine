Otherwise the current consensus is that knowledge of the viral etiology\u2014among those viruses with easily accessible point-of-care testing (eg, RSV and influenza)\u2014does not affect treatment of the individual patient.10 As rapid microarray testing becomes less costly and more widely used, however, we are likely to learn much more about the short- and long-term implications of the diverse viruses linked to bronchiolitis.

One combination that is believed to increase the severity of illness is RSV and hMPV coinfection.78 As part of a larger study examining severe bronchiolitis, RSV and hMPV were identified in the bronchoalveolar fluid of 70% of 30 intubated infants.79 In a different study, 72% of 25 intubated children had RSV and hMPV coinfection compared with 10% of 171 children hospitalized on the general wards.80 Interestingly, hMPV was also found in 5 of 9 patients during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS outbreak in Canada.81 Recent studies investigating RSV and hMPV suggest that they may have distinctive pathogenesis,66 elicit unique cytokine profiles,82, 83, 84, 85 and use different mechanisms to activate human dendritic cells, which play a key role in the adaptive immune response.86 Moreover, a prospective study by Laham and colleagues87 measured cytokine levels in Buenos Aires infants presenting with upper or lower respiratory tract illness and discovered that the 22 infants who had hMPV were poor inducers of inflammatory cytokines compared with the 46 infants who had RSV. The authors concluded that the viruses elicit disease by different mechanisms and therefore hMPV may augment RSV disease severity. To date, however, studies not only have not had the sample size to answer definitively if coinfection with hMPV and RSV increases bronchiolitis severity but also have been inadequate to determine the clinical implications of the many other pathogen combinations.",

Indeed, based on a Tennessee Medicaid database there is a dose\u2013response relationship between bronchiolitis severity (as defined by inpatient, ED, and outpatient clinic) and the increased odds of early childhood asthma and asthma-specific morbidity.96\n",

The major source of vitamin D for most humans is from exposure of skin to the B fraction of ultraviolet light (UVB). In northern latitudes between November and March there are insufficient UVB rays to produce vitamin D, however.121 Sunscreen use is recommended to protect against future skin cancer,122, 123, 124 and this further decreases vitamin D skin production.125 Unfortunately, lifestyle changes over the past few decades have made vitamin D deficiency increasingly common.121, 126, 127\n",

Two family-based studies demonstrated that gene polymorphisms on the vitamin D receptor were associated with childhood and adult asthma128, 129 and vitamin D deficiency is correlated with lower pulmonary function in adolescents130 and adults.131 Of greater relevance, Camargo and colleagues132 discovered in a prospective birth cohort in Massachusetts that lower maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for recurrent wheezing in the mothers' young children. These findings were replicated in 5-year-old Scottish children.133 Camargo and colleagues134 recently confirmed these novel findings in a separate birth cohort of 922 children from New Zealand (41\u00b0\u201343\u00b0 S) where low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in cord blood were associated with increased risk for respiratory infections and childhood wheezing. Moreover, Litonjua and colleagues135 recently examined the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk for an asthma-related ED visit or hospitalization. Among 1022 children who had asthma in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP),136 those who had low baseline 25(OH)D levels (<75 nmol/L) were more likely to have a severe asthma exacerbation over a 4-month period (OR 1.50; 95%CI, 1.13\u20131.98). Finally, Brehm and colleagues137 recently reported that among 616 children in Costa Rica who had asthma, higher 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with reduced odds of any hospitalization and reduced use of anti-inflammatory medications.",

Wang and colleagues138 also have demonstrated that vitamin D is a direct inducer of the cathelicidin gene. Most recently, Janssen and colleagues determined that single nucleotide polymorphisms in four of the innate immunity genes, including the vitamin D receptor, helped predict susceptibility to RSV bronchiolitis.147, 148 Taken together, the clinical and mechanistic data support a role for vitamin D as an important factor in the relation between respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis and their link to recurrent wheezing.",

It remains unclear, however, which children who have severe bronchiolitis (eg, an episode requiring hospitalization) will develop recurrent wheezing or asthma. Two intriguing factors are bronchiolitis due to RV and low levels of vitamin D. Developing a clearer understanding of the complex pathway from bronchiolitis to asthma would help identify the subset of children who have severe bronchiolitis who are at high risk for developing asthma. This understanding would not only help clinicians target follow-up care but also advance bronchiolitis and asthma prevention research by better routing high-risk children into future randomized trials.",
