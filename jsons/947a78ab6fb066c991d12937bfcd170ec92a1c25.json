            "text": "The genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, was made available in January, 2020 (1), providing critical information on the primary amino acid sequences of potential targets. A particularly important target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein that is responsible for the first step in the viral infection process, binding to human cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The conserved expression and interaction of ACE2 indicates a wide range of hosts (human and nonhuman) for SARS-CoV-2 (2) . The S protein is a homotrimer with each monomer comprised of 1281 amino acids. The monomers are expected to be highly glycosylated with 22 N-linked glycosylation sequons and 4 O-linked predicted glycosylation sites (3), although only 16 N-linked glycosylation sites were observed in a cryo-EM map of S produced in HEK293F cells (4) . Viral coat proteins are often glycosylated which helps pathogens evade the host immune system, modulate access of host proteases, and can enhance cellular attachment through modification of protein structure and/or direct participation at the viral coat protein/cell receptor interface. These glycans are, however, only partially resolved in the experimental structure such that a computational approach is helpful to predict their behavior. The human ACE2 protein is a 788 amino acid integral membrane protein with seven N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain. The binding kinetics between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the hACE2 receptor will depend on the 3D structures of both molecules and their molecular interactions which can be impacted strongly by glycosylation. Knowledge of the spike protein and ACE2 amino acid sequences have led to the commercial availability of the spike protein, ACE2, and various fragments of these, with and without purification/fusion tags, produced recombinantly in various expression hosts including Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), insect cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO), and E. coli. While the availability of recombinant sources for S and ACE2 glycoproteins have greatly contributed to our understanding of the structure and interactions between these proteins, it is important to recognize that glycosylation of recombinant S and ACE proteins will depend on the host cell (5), the recombinant protein, as well as production (6, 7) and purification methods (8) . As molecular models and molecular dynamics simulations can describe the interactions of proteins with glycans and the modulation of protein structure by glycans (9, 10) they are powerful tools to assess the significance of glycosylations on 3D structure and binding site interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor, and to design novel biotherapeutics including optimizing glycosylation.",

            "text": "A promising strategy for the design of COVID-19 therapeutic proteins is a fusion of the extracellular domain of ACE2, the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with the Fc region of human immunoglobulin, IgG1, by a linker separating the two domains (11) . The neutralization strategy behind ACE2-Fc is shown in Figure   1 (11) . This therapeutic design is often called an immunoadhesin, a chimeric protein combining the ligandbinding region of the cell receptor with the constant domain of an immunoglobulin (12) . These chimeric molecules form dimers through disulfide bonds between Fc domains; this bivalency increases the affinity for the ligand. The human ACE2 receptor has been shown to be the primary receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses for entry into and infection of human cells (13, 14) , although the binding site is distinct from the catalytic domain of ACE2. With an ACE2-Fc immunoadhesin the ACE2 portion can act as a circulating \"bait or decoy\" to bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein preventing it from entering human cells while the Fc region confers longer circulatory half-life, provides effector functions of the immune system to clear the virus, and allows simple well-established purification using Protein A affinity chromatography. Immunoadhesins are a distinct class of antivirals that can be used prophylactically as well as post-infection and differ from both vaccines and antibodies. Unlike vaccines, they are not intended to elicit an immune response to the viral infection, and unlike antibody therapies, their design is greatly simplified since once the cellular receptor for viral entry is identified the immunoadhesin can be quickly designed and produced.",

The re-emergent SARS virus in 2003-2004 had a lower affinity for human ACE2 resulting in less severe infection and no secondary transmissions (15) . In this strategy the exogenous ACE2 would compensate for decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, contributing to the treatment of acute respiratory distress, and potentially reduce inflammation and reactive oxygen species in the lung (16) . Most importantly, recombinant ACE2-Fc fusion proteins, with native ACE2 catalytic activity as well as a mutant version with lower ACE2 catalytic activity, produced using transfection of HEK293, have shown high affinity binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (17) .

The faster dynamics of glycans complicates the structural and conformational characterization of glycans in laboratory experiments (18) . In atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, glycan conformations can be straight-forwardly analyzed to obtain structural information, as glycan dynamics are much closer to the computational timescale than the protein dynamics. However, neighboring glycans can interact with each other and essentially lock each other in which can lead to very slow equilibration into the correct conformation (9) . Therefore, algorithms are needed to generate realistic glycan configurations as glycans are regularly not fully resolved experimentally. Consequently, only a few simulations of related fully glycosylated proteins available (19) (20) (21) (22) among them very recently a proposed glycosylated model of the Spike protein (23) . Our group has made significant progress in the field of glycan modeling in recent years (9, 10, 24) . N-glycan structure is highly heterogeneous, and the relative abundance of glycans depends on the expression system for glycoprotein production. Plant-based transient expression system is well-suited to produce recombinant ACE2-Fc under the current COVID-19 pandemic given its high production speed. Two glycovariants of ACE2-Fc are simulated in this work: one is targeted for ER retention with high mannose glycoforms, and the second is targeted for secretion with plant complex glycoforms. These glycovariants are currently being expressed and purified at UC Davis.",

Each peptidase domain of the ACE2-Fc variants is capable of binding one SARS-CoV-2 SpFr (Sequence Seq3), which contains one glycosylation site. The ACE2-Fc/SpFr structure is depicted in Figure 2 . The coordinated Zn 2+ site is shown in Figure SF1 . All 3D structures are rendered with VMD (29). ",

            "text": "ACE2-Fc variant 1 will express high-mannose type glycans when synthesized in plants, while variant 2 will express standard plant glycans. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 SpFr will exhibit its own glycosylation depending on the host cell; here we assume common mammalian-like glycosylation. Our simulations employed uniform glycosylation profiles to approximate these glycosylation profiles. ACE2-Fc variant 1 is fully glycosylated with Man8 glycans, variant 2 is fully glycosylated with GnGnXF3 glycans the latter is consistent with a very recent experimental study (30) , and the SpFr is glycosylated with ANaF 6 (31). Figure  3 shows these glycans using the Consortium of Functional Glycomics nomenclature. Four systems containing ACE2-Fc variants were simulated in this work. The first system contains ACE2-Fc variant 1 with Man8 glycans. The second system contains ACE2-Fc variant 2 with GnGnXF 3 glycans. The third and fourth systems are the immunoadhesins of the first and second systems with the SARS-CoV-2 SpFr bound, respectively. The SpFr is always glycosylated with ANaF 6 . Table 1 summarizes the simulated systems. This work is largely made possible due to the recent cryogenic electron microscopy work that resolves the ACE2-B 0 AT1 and ACE2-B 0 AT1/SpFr structures, corresponding to PDB codes 6M18 and 6M17, respectively (33) . The ACE2 and ACE2/SpFr domains were taken from these structures and fused to the Fc domain (PDB 3SGJ) (34) . The Zn 2+ and coordinating residues in 6M17 and 6M18 are poorly coordinated in these structures. The conformation of these residues along with a coordinating water were instead taken from PDB 1R42 (35) . Histidine protonation states for each system were determined using Reduce (36) , and are summarized in Table ST2 .",

            "text": "Steps 4 and 7 exhibit new, publicly available software under GNU General Public Licenses. GlyRot has previously been used to model glycosylated butyrylcholinesterase and CMG2-Fc (9, 10). Forcefield topologies were generated using the AmberFF14SB (43) forcefield for protein atoms, the Glycam06-j (44) forcefield for glycan atoms, and the SPC/E water model (45) . Steps 8 through 14 are performed using the Gromacs suite (46) (47) (48) . Systems were solvated in rectangular boxes such the minimum distance between the solute and periodic boundary is 1.2 nm. A rectangular box (for size see Table ST3 ) was found to be sufficient for 10 ns; longer simulations may require a larger cubic box if the solute rotates significantly. A reduced timestep NVT in step 10 is required to relax solute-solvent contacts. Steps 10 and 11-13 used position restraints on the protein atoms. All simulations were performed at 310 K and 1 atm with the Velocity Rescale thermostat (49) and Parinello-Rahman barostat (50) using time constants of 0.1 ps and 2 ps, respectively. All water bonds are constrained with SETTLE (51); all other bonds are constrained with LINCS (52). A 1 nm cutoff was used for short-range nonbonded interactions. Particle Mesh Ewald was used to model long-range electrostatics (53) . Table ST3 contains additional information on system sizes and solvation. Each system was simulated using one compute node with 16 cores. Simulations averaged 2.9 ns/day for systems without the SpFr, and 2.0 ns/day for systems with the SpFr. Figure 3 shows the starting configurations generated as described above (left) and the configurations after MD for 10 ns (right) of all simulated systems. Systems of this size will not fully equilibrate in 10 ns, but evidence of structural stability and concerted motion can still be observed. All systems exhibit shortening of the flexible linker domain between ACE2 and Fc. This shortening can be quantified by analyzing the center of mass distance between the ACE2 and Fc ordered domains, shown in Figure SF2 . AF M8 and AF M8 /SpFr exhibit more shortening of the linker domain than AF GG and AF GG /SpFr, possibly due to the difference in glycosylation in the Fc domain, which is closest to the flexible linker region. In the AF M8 /SpFr and AF GG /SpFr systems, ACE2 glycans near the ACE2/SpFr interface form contacts across the binding interface, indicating that glycosylation may significantly affect binding kinetics. Additionally, glycans on SpFr that were initially oriented away from the protein are reoriented towards ACE2 after 10 ns. The structure of the ordered domains of ACE2-Fc and SpFr appear to retain structural stability. The glycans, on the other hand, show significant reorientation, as the configurational dynamics of glycans is faster than proteins as expected (9) . To quantitatively assess structural stability, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the ordered domains of ACE2-Fc are shown in Figure 4 . All profiles exhibit stable dynamics near or below 2.5 \u00c5. Conformational trending occurs when the RMSD increases from the initial and decreases towards the final. Conformational trending is particularly evident in the Fc domains of AF GG and AF GG /SpFr, while it is particularly absent from the Fc domains of AF M8 and AF M8 /SpFr. This difference indicates that GnGnXF 3 glycosylation in the Fc domain promotes a conformational change in the Fc domain. Backbone RMSD profiles for the SpFr are provided in Figure SF3 . The SpFr domains show stable RMSD profiles with significant conformational trending, potentially due to contacts with nearby glycans. ",
