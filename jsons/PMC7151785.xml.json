Quite soon, it was shown that HIV-2 is less transmissible, is characterized by slower disease progression, and is geographically limited to West Africa and countries with direct ties to that region. The probable explanation of the epidemiological differences is that the plasma viral load in HIV-2 infected persons tends to be much lower than in HIV-1 infected persons.3, 4, 5, 6 In this chapter, the epidemiology, natural history, interactions with HIV-1, and treatment of HIV-2 are discussed. The comparison with HIV-1 is central to this chapter (see Table 56.1\n).3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32\n",

It is theoretically possible that the virus used to be more virulent than it is now, but this is unlikely: there is no record of an epidemic of an AIDS-like syndrome in West Africa prior to 1985. So, if we assume that the virulence of the virus has not substantially changed over time, there must have been an increase in transmission that amplified a small outbreak into a large epidemic. This could have been due to an increase in unscreened blood transfusions on a large scale, high rates of sexual partner change, many concurrent sexual partnerships or presence of co-factors enhancing sexual transmission like sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or non-sterile injections. Several of these factors may have been present at the same time in Guinea-Bissau, especially in the period from 1963 to 1974, when a war of independence was fought against Portugal. The transmission of the virus may not be efficient enough to maintain ongoing epidemic spread in the absence of important amplifiers such as frequent commercial sex, high levels of STIs, and unscreened blood transfusions.",

There is no proof for this and it does not explain why HIV-2 became epidemic in Guinea-Bissau and nowhere else.",

Perhaps a larger proportion of HIV-1 proviruses is actively replicating. Another possibility is that in HIV-1 infection, more DNA is integrated and replication-competent compared with HIV-2. It is also possible that in HIV-1 infection, high proviral DNA levels exist in other compartments than blood. Finally, it may be that HIV-2 virions are cleared more efficiently.14 In six long-term non-progressing HIV-2 infected patients with undetectable plasma viral load and normal CD4 counts, it could be demonstrated that replication-competent virus was present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), albeit at extremely low concentrations.69\n",

            "text": "One of the first epidemiological studies on HIV-2, conducted in Bissau in 1987\u20131988,77 showed that the mortality associated with HIV-2 infection was much lower than that usually found in HIV-1 infection. All subsequent studies have confirmed this.5,\n6,\n53,\n67,\n73,\n78 In a seroprevalent clinical cohort in The Gambia, HIV-2 patients had a lower mortality than HIV-1 patients, but this lower mortality was limited to those with a normal CD4 count (>500/\u03bcL). Among those with a CD4 count <200/\u03bcL, the mortality rate was similar between HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected subjects.67 This could be explained in two ways. The first possibility is that all HIV-2-infected subjects experience a deterioration of their immune system, but this decline is slower than in HIV-1 infection. Once the CD4 count has declined to below 200/\u03bcL, patients are at high risk of fatal opportunistic infections and there is no difference in mortality. The other possibility is that those with HIV-2 infection fall in either of two categories: those whose immune system is not affected at all by the infection, and those whose immune system is damaged by the infection, at a rate similar to HIV-1. This question is unresolved and long-term follow-up of an incident cohort would be required to answer it.",

None of the seven analyses so far have been able to reproduce this finding, so currently available epidemiological data do not support a protective effect of HIV-2 infection against incident HIV-1 infection.91 The investigators of the cohort in which the original finding was made, have provided no updates of the effect in that cohort since 1999,66,\n92,\n93 so it is unknown whether the effect in that cohort persisted, or declined over time, or even reversed. Two studies compared the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes among singly infected and HIV-1 and HIV-2 dually infected subjects, and found no differences in frequencies.94,\n95 This argues against a possible protective effect of HIV-2 that is limited to certain HIV-1 subtypes.",
