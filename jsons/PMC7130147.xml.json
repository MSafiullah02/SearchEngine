The ribavirin-treated patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels, a well-known adverse prognostic factor in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The nonsignificantly higher mortality could be due to the more severe disease in this group. Viral load, another important predictor of mortality, was not available.2 Moreover, Figure 1 seemed inaccurate: the survival in ribavirin-treated patients should be 0.88 at day 30 (5 of 44 patients died) instead of 0.71.",

From the data presented, a more likely explanation for the more severe drop in hemoglobin in the hypoxemic subgroup was that they had more severe disease. The survival curves in Figure 4 also appeared inaccurate: the survival in patients with drop in hemoglobin > 2 g/dL should be 0.69 (5 of 16 patients died) instead of 0.45. Hence, the result of the log-rank test (p = 0.007) needs to be justified.",
