Materials and Methods: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. Results: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT score were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively, for the discrimination of the 2 types. The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/ critical patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.",

Basic disease treatment, secondary infection prevention, and timely organ function support are needed for them. Therefore, it is very important to find the related factors of disease severity in clinical practice. However, as far as we know, there is no study on the characteristics and risk factors associated with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, in this study, we compared the clinical and computed tomography (CT) features of 58 ordinary COVID-19 cases and 25 severe/critical cases to explore the related factors of severe/critical patients.",

The ordinary patients all had fever or other respiratory symptoms with CT manifestations of pneumonia. The severe/critical patients met any of the following condition: (1) respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater; (2) finger of oxygen saturation of 93% or less in a resting state; (3) arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 )/inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO 2 ) of 300 mm Hg or less (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa); (4) respiratory failure occurred and mechanical ventilation required; (5) shock occurred; and (6) patients with other organ failure needed intensive care unit monitoring and treatment. 8 The exclusion criteria were COVID-19 patients without abnormal manifestations on CT. Finally, 7 patients were excluded because of no abnormal manifestations on CT and 83 patients were included. The clinical parameters included age, sex, time from illness onset to hospital admission, comorbidities (systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), symptoms, clinical signs, and laboratory findings were collected and evaluated.",

Two chest radiologists with 10 and 8 years of experience who were blinded to the clinical data evaluated the CT findings in consensus. For each of the 83 patients, the initial chest CT images were evaluated for the following characteristics based on the Fleischner Society Nomenclature recommendations and similar studies 9,10 : ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, nodule, reticulation, interlobular septal thickening, crazy-paving pattern, linear opacities, subpleural curvilinear line, bronchial wall thickening, lymph node enlargement, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. The \"spider web sign\" was defined as a triangular or angular GGO in the subpleural lung with the internal interlobular septa thickened like a net; the adjacent pleura was pulled and formed a spider web-like shape in the corner. To quantify the extent of lesions, a thin-section CT score was assigned on the basis of all abnormal areas involved. 11 Each lobe was assigned a score that was based on the following: score 0, 0% involvement; score 1, less than 5% involvement; score 2, 5% to 25% involvement; score 3, 26% to 49% involvement; score 4, 50% to 75% involvement; and score 5, greater than 75% involvement. There was a score of 0 to 5 for each lobe, with a total possible score of 0 to 25. The software of the Pulmonary Infection Assistant Diagnosis (V1.7.0.1, Dexin Medical Imaging Technology Co, Ltd, Xian City, Shaanxi Province, China) was applied to acquire the 3D visualization of CT-VRT by automatically segmenting the whole lung and pulmonary lesions, then further precise manual correction was made.",

Normally distributed data were analyzed by independent sample t test; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the clinical value of CT scores in distinguishing the ordinary and severe/critical types, and find the corresponding cutoff value. For logistic regression analysis, quantitative variables were transformed into categorical variables according to their reference ranges or the cutoff values provided by ROC analysis.

Chest pain may result from the inflammatory affection of the pleura. Dyspnea is related to the severe damage to alveoli in the severe/critical group.

In this study, we found that the most common CT findings were GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and \"spider web sign\" for both groups of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with ordinary groups, consolidation was significantly more frequent in severe/critical patients, which indicates that the alveoli are completely filled by inflammatory exudation. This usually means that the virus diffuses into the respiratory epithelium, leading to necrotizing bronchitis and diffuse alveolar damage. 16, 17 Severe/critical patients showed more lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. These extrapulmonary lesions may indicate the occurrence of severe inflammation. Although GGO is the most common CT feature of COVID-19 pneumonia, no statistical incidence difference was observed between our 2 groups. The CT scores of the severe/critical group were significantly higher than those of the ordinary group. It can accurately distinguish the severe/critical patients from the ordinary patients (AUC = 0.87), which is helpful for the judgment of clinical condition and has important clinical value. To sum up, CT can evaluate the severity of the disease, which is of great significance for the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. This study has several limitations. First, the data of the 2 groups were not balanced, and the sample size of the severe/critical group was relatively small. Further studies with more patients, especially severe/critical patients, are warranted. Second, because most patients remain in the hospital at the time of submission, it is difficult to assess the risk factors for poor outcomes.
