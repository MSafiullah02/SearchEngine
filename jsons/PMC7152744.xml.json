Below, I will focus on visual, rather than linguistic, construction. The point remains that imagination goes far beyond what a VCE theory can explain. In the section \u201cNeuroscience linking episodic memory and imagination,\u201d I will briefly explore data that break away from an emphasis on navigation and suggest that IBSEN provides a step toward understanding such data.",

The notion of locometric space is particularly relevant to the notion of path integration, the ability of a wandering animal to keep track of the location of its home base relative to its current position, a capability related to dynamic remapping of the hippocampal map (Guazzelli et al. 2001).",

            "text": "To pose the problem dramatically for the human brain, consider the Maguire et al. (2006) study comparing London taxi drivers with London bus drivers, who were matched for driving experience and levels of stress, but differed in that taxi drivers had mastered \u201cthe Knowledge\u201d of all details of London streets, whereas bus drivers follow a constrained set of routes. Taxi drivers had greater gray matter volume in mid\u2010posterior hippocampus and less volume in anterior hippocampus than bus drivers. Furthermore, years of navigation experience correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume only in taxi drivers, with right posterior gray matter volume increasing and anterior volume decreasing with more navigation experience. Maguire et al. conclude that spatial knowledge, and not stress or driving, is associated with the pattern of hippocampal gray matter volume in taxi drivers. They then tested for the ability to acquire new visuo\u2010spatial information by using the Rey\u2013Osterrieth complex figure test\u2014a neuropsychological assessment in which examinees are asked to reproduce a complicated line drawing, first by copying it freehand (recognition), and then drawing from memory (recall)\u2014and found bus drivers performed better than taxi drivers. Maguire et al. speculate that the complex spatial representation which facilitates expert navigation might have come at a cost to new spatial memories and gray matter volume in the anterior hippocampus (a very different longitudinal shift from the change of scales offered by Kjelstrup et al.). However, this may be misleading\u2014perhaps the issue is not reduced ability to form new spatial memories but rather a reduced ability to form complex spatial representations incompatible with the representational system developed in the taxi driver\u2019s brain to encode their expert knowledge. For example, Tichomirov and Poznyanskaya (1966) found that master chess players looked at boards for less time than novices and remembered positions more accurately, with the expert turning her gaze from one significant feature of the board to another, while the novice searched randomly. If the pieces are randomly arranged on the board, so that the expert has no meaningful search strategy, her performance on memorizing the board is much like that of the novice. Here, the actions which scan the environment are themselves constrained by the subject\u2019s plan of action, the plan to play a winning game of chess. Perhaps analogous considerations apply to the taxi driver\u2019s analysis of spatial layouts. We see here the action-perception cycle in full swing\u2014we perceive the environment to the extent that we are prepared to interact with it in some reasonably structured fashion (Arbib 1989).",

If movement occurs along a new edge, thus encountering a new situation, a new x\u2032 becomes x(t + 1): the new node x\u2032 will be added to the world graph, and the edge from x to x\u2032 will be tagged with the appropriate defining features.Another form of structural change merges nodes: If the animal thinks it is at P(x\u2032), the place represented by node x\u2032 of WG, but recognizes a place represented by a different node x\u2033, then x\u2032 will be merged with x\u2033",

The full WG model explains the dynamics of each of these; the TAM\u2013WG model expands upon this by linking TAM and WG: At any time, the current node x(t) signals the neighborhood in which the animal finds itself. This signals to the hippocampus to encode (or continue using) a \u201clocometric chart\u201d of that neighborhood. As the animal moves, the hippocampus signals current location to the World Graph (WG), posited to be in prefrontal cortex; WG combines this with desired location to plan possible paths.

Modeling this purely at the WG level would predict that if the food is more attractive (perhaps because the animal is very hungry) than the shock is painful, the rat will always move toward F; in the reverse situation it will move away from F. But what Miller found was that the rat oscillated back and forth between E and F! We could only succeed in modeling this by adding a locometric map of the passageways/edges, with a gradient of attraction (food) or repulsion (shock) that varies with distance from E and F. The key was to posit that each gradient rose continuously from E to F, but that at E the attraction was greater than the repulsion, while at F the reverse was the case. In other words, the appetitive attraction of food as a function of locomotory space in E\u2013F remains high at E, whereas the aversive repulsion of fear in E\u2013F is low at E. There is thus a cross-over point X not at the WG-level of the cognitive map but rather at the level of the local \u201clocometric chart\u201d current in hippocampus. As a result, the rat runs from E toward F, but on passing X turns tail and runs back toward E, passing X again and reaching a point where hunger overcomes fear and thus ends up oscillating between the E and F nodes. In general, the idea is that WG can navigate from one \u201csignificant place\u201d to another via various intermediates; the locometric space can capture the motion details once a start and end place are selected within the map at that level.",

For forward translation, the ego motion signal gates the top-down connections from the parietal transformation layer to the parietal window such that the \u201cnormal\u201d top-down weights connecting these regions are down-regulated, while a second, alternate set of top-down weights are up-regulated.

Although this might be addressed partially by enriching the PR representation to include affordances as well as objects, it should be noted that a gap between boundaries (consider an open doorway) may be more salient for navigation.

My claim is that although, in some cases, we can bridge directly from high-level function to neural networks, in many cases we need intermediate units of functional analysis. To this end I introduce schemas as \u201ccomposable programs in the mind,\u201d but they differ from a serial computer program or neural network in that a schema may have multiple instances that are concurrently active. A schema constitutes the \u201clong-term memory\u201d of a perceptual and/or motor skill or more abstract functions, including coordinating such skills; while the process of perception or action is controlled by active copies of schemas, called schema instances. A schema may be instantiated to form multiple schema instances as active copies of the process to apply that knowledge. For example, given a schema that represents generic knowledge about some object, we may need several active instances of the schema, each suitably tuned to subserve our perception of a different instance of that object. For certain behaviors, there may be no distinction between schema and instance\u2014a single neural network may embody the skill memory and provide the processor that implements it. However, in more complex behaviors (as in the VISIONS model), the different mobilizations of a given \u201cskill-unit\u201d must be carefully distinguished. A schema assemblage is a network of schema instances, and its characteristics are similar to that of a single schema if committed to long term memory.",

Each schema instance has an activity level which indicates its current salience for the ongoing computation.

It is thus important to distinguish \u201cactivity level\u201d as a particular parameter of a schema from the \u201cneural activity\u201d which will vary with different neural implementations of the schema. The activity level of a perceptual schema signals the credibility of the hypothesis that what the schema represents is indeed present, whereas other schema parameters represent other salient properties such as size, location, and motion of the perceived object.

A schema network does not, in general, need a top-level controller. Schema instances can combine their effects by distributed processes of competition and cooperation (i.e., interactions which, respectively, decrease and increase the activity levels of these instances), rather than the operation of an inference engine on a passive store of knowledge.

These expectations may be wrong, and so it is that we sometimes learn from our mistakes. In a general setting, there is no fixed repertoire of basic schemas. Rather, new schemas may be formed as assemblages of old schemas; but once formed a schema may be tuned by some adaptive mechanism. This tunability of schema assemblages allows them to start as composite but emerge as primitive, much as a skill is honed into a unified whole from constituent pieces. For this reason, a model expressed in a schema-level formalism may only approximate the behavior of a model expressed in a neural net formalism. When used in conjunction with neural networks, schema theory provides a means of providing a functional/structural decomposition, and is to be contrasted with models which employ some learning rule to train an otherwise undifferentiated network to respond as specified by some training set.",

My answer (as will by now have been anticipated by the reader) was to understand that the memories are themselves constructs (though in a metaphorical or neural sense) in the form of malleable schema assemblages. Imagination can then proceed by extracting salient subassemblages from different memories and meld and transform them to develop a new assemblage that meets certain criteria that guide design.",

Schacter et al. distinguish between temporal and non-temporal factors in analyses of memory and imagination, i.e., imagining the future is a special case of imagination more generally. They observed a \u201ccommon brain network\u201d that underlies both memory and imagination. However, as they and others demonstrate, there are distinct brain networks for memory and imagination, but the finding is that brain imaging reveals a notable overlap. The underlying networks can couple flexibly with other networks to support complex goal-directed simulations. Further data and discussion are contained in many papers, and the next subsection will briefly review some key findings that complement their work. This is a limited sample, but I hope that it will stimulate others to link further empirical data to new modeling efforts that build on the conceptual foundations offered below.",

Consequently, a partial cue that activated the index could activate the neocortical patterns and thus retrieve the memory of the episode. Building on the indexing theory, Moscovitch et al. (2016) developed a dynamic perspective on episodic memory and the hippocampus that runs from perception to language and from empathy to problem solving. Their component process model holds that, when encoding episodes, hippocampus obligatorily binds together into a memory trace or engram those neural elements in the medial temporal lobe and neocortex that give rise to the perceptual, emotional, and conceptual experience together with a sense of autonoetic consciousness that engages the self in some form of reliving of the experience. However, our episodic memory may engage scenes for which we have been an observer rather than an engaged participant so the autonoetic component may be optional. Similarly, when we turn from episodic memory to imagination\u2014and especially to imagination related to architectural design\u2014the sense of self-engagement need not be involved in all cases. For our purposes, the component process model leaves open two complementary questions: (i) What binds together the different aspects of a memory, and (ii) what would then permit \u201cunbinding\u201d so that fragments from different episodes could get activated, then interact, and possibly cohere into a new imagined episode?",

They then suggest that there is a key component process underlying all of these cognitive processes, namely scene construction. However, this claim is unsatisfying in at least two ways:We have already noted (Elward and Vargha-Khadem 2018) that scene understanding can proceed in the absence of hippocampus. In other words, the fact that these areas may be engaged in diverse tasks related to scene construction does not rule out the engagement of areas outside their \u201cconstruction network\u201d also being engaged in scene construction. As suggested earlier, the resolution may be that the normal brain may employ hippocampus for preparing scenes for possible memorization in concert with other areas, and hippocampus (but in association with other brain regions) then plays a key role in indexing retrieval of what has been memorized. Indeed, a shortcoming of VISIONS is that it models visual scene understanding based solely on semantic memory and enriched by linkage with prior episodes. It does not evaluate scenes as memorable and decide whether or not to commit (aspects of) the associated interpretation to memory.In summary, saying that \u201ca network including hippocampus is engaged in these diverse processes\u201d seems not to advance us beyond saying \u201chippocampus is engaged in these diverse processes\u201d unless one can offer more explicit statements about the differential engagement of these regions in the very different tasks listed by Hassabis and Maguire.

These papers offer a rich trove of data on scene construction and reconstruction as engaged in episodic memory and imagination, but none offer the process-by-process computational/conceptual analysis that we offer here in seeking to learn from both TAM\u2013WG and VISIONS as we begin to build bridges from spatial navigation via visual construction to episodic memory and imagination. The next section will show how an extension of VISIONS-style modeling may begin to fill the gap in a way that addresses the challenges offered by the quote from the architect Peter Zumthor.",

We can place this within our emerging framework for IBSEN as follows:Schema theory provides a coherent framework for an above-the-neuron analysis for cognitive neuroscience.Competition and cooperation between schema instances can both make sense of the current environment and determine assemblages of motor schemas that control action, with perceptual schemas passing parameters for relevant affordances to the motor schemas.More generally, though, the brain can engage diverse schemas beyond those immediately linked to perception and action, and these can undergird mechanisms that underlie abstract thought, memory and imagination.In each case, the activation of, and interaction between, schema instances involves bottom-up influences (e.g., from sensory inputs), lateral interactions (between already activated instances in diverse \u201cregions\u201d), and top-down influences (created by context, motivation, tasks, and more).",

We have all had the experience of driving repeatedly down certain streets where we have command of enough cues to navigate successfully, perhaps even anticipating certain sharp bends rather than responding to external affordances. But here\u2019s the rub. One day, when driving down a street after a prolonged absence, we recognize that there is a new house on our route\u2014and yet, try hard as we may, we cannot remember what the previous house there looked like. On the other hand, there may be a house that provides a distinctive cue (it has been promoted to a WG node, one might say, as a \u201clandmark\u201d) such as \u201cwhen you get to that house, start looking for a right hand turn that is hard to spot behind the trees.\u201d If that house is replaced, we will be able to recall it. The point? The mechanisms that give a place enough salience to be promoted from the locometric map may be comparable to those that construct an episodic memory from the salient details of a salient episode. An important distinction, though, is that \u201cpromotion\u201d to a WG node may be a cumulative process, whereas episodic memory will be a variety of one-shot learning if it constitutes an episode of brief duration\u2014though many episodes that constitute an episodic memory are indeed prolonged, but can frame a host of subepisodes.",

Finding such a path may involve linkage of multiple maps\u2014(1) getting from the kitchen to the car, (2) getting to the airport and parking the car, (3) flying from A to B to C, (4) and so on. In cases (1) and (2) there is linkage to two distinct locometric maps; in (3) one might observe a flight map on a video screen, but this is irrelevant to your own self-controlled movements. In (4) one might, having arrived at a novel airport, build a new cognitive map as one finds one\u2019s way from airplane to a waiting car, and this might be forgotten or, in piecemeal form, speed the construction of a cognitive map on the next visit to that airport.

Place cell activation encoding the current position of the rat feeds the PFC reservoir which generates the successor place cell activation that represents the next step in the reproduced sequence. This is played into the rat, which advances to the coded location and then generates de-novo the current place cell activation. They show how this integrated sensory-motor system can learn simple navigation sequences, and then can synthesize novel efficient sequences based on prior experience (Cazin et al. 2019). The model of hippocampal replay generates a distribution of snippets as a function of their proximity to a reward. The integrative PFC reservoir reconstructs the efficient sequence based on exposure to this distribution of snippets that favors paths that are most proximal to rewards. This contributes to the understanding of hippocampal replay in novel navigation sequence formation.",

They have PFC control successive \u201cmini-paths\u201d by linking step-by-step snippets whereas in WG, PFC would encode nodes for the baited food wells and for any via points that mark obstacles to direct runs between places already represented by nodes. To address their challenge, WG would have to be augmented in two ways:(i)If there is an edge discovered between two nodes, WG would require experience at the locometric level to determine the distance (or, more generally, effort) required to traverse it. Spatial difference learning would then use this measure, rather than number of nodes traversed, in its discounting to establish the shortest path from one node to a desired goal.(ii)Classic studies (Olton et al. 1979, 1980) looked at rats running a radial maze. On each trial, the ends of the arms of the maze were baited with food. As the rat reached the end of an arm, it would consume all the food there. The key observation was that the rat rarely revisited an arm during a given trial\u2014but would return to the end of each arm on later trials. This suggests, importantly, that their cognitive map included a working memory. In our terms, the animal\u2019s experience with the maze would yield a WG with food-cues associated with the end of each arm, but eating there would be remembered for the length of a trial. Thus, when a hungry rat has visited one or more food-sources, its working memory would temporarily set the food-value of their nodes to zero.",

Hippocampal online reactivations during reward-based learning, usually categorized as replay and preplay events, have been found to be important for performance improvement over time and for memory consolidation. A key is the need to transform reward information into state-action values for decision-making and to propagate it over time and space. They present a model-based bidirectional planning model which accounts for a variety of hippocampal reactivations. The model combines forward trajectory sampling from current position and backward sampling through prioritized sweeping from reward location until the two trajectories connect.

This requires careful investigation of the dorsal\u2013ventral trade-off for each of the three dorsal (Kravitz et al. 2013) and six ventral (Kravitz et al. 2011) functions/pathways. But there are further data for the new model to address. Maguire considers parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus as her loci for scene construction, while Baldassano et al. (2016) find evidence for a two-network model of scene perception with two different streams quite different from those charted above. On their account, the occipital place area and posterior parahippocampal place area process the current visual features of a scene, whereas the caudal inferior parietal lobule, retrosplenial complex, and anterior parahippocampal place area perform higher-level context and navigation tasks (drawing on long-term memory structures including the hippocampus).",

There may be useful parallels between describing an imagined scene/episode and describing a detailed photo of a scene as one observes it. Elsewhere, we have modeled the latter process by coupling VISIONS to a language processing system based on Template Construction Grammar (TCG), in which constructions are active schemas yielding schema instances akin to those in VISIONS (Arbib 2017; Barr\u00e8s and Lee 2014). In particular, Lee (2012) observed and modeled the difference between the well-articulated description of a fully analyzed scene and the piecemeal description that emerges under time pressure. Perhaps the latter may provide a bridge to the handling of new vistas while navigating\u2014experiencing the route while uttering/behaving on the basis of current affordances. Such analysis of verbal expression linked to navigation in familiar versus unfamiliar environments might be a useful tool for further assessing the role of the locale versus taxon systems in relation to memory, with perhaps the former implicating episodic memory whereas the latter does not.",

Rather, it exists in something like the Working Memory in the extension of VISIONS hypothesized as part of IBSEN, but now extracting material from diverse images to create a new assemblage of schema instances that satisfies some criteria. In autobiographical memory, we extract certain related episodes that cohere into some sort of narrative. In imagination, we form new \u201cvirtual episodes\u201d that form a new narrative that may involve an equilibrium\u2014as in drawing or writing\u2014between external and internal constructions, or which may be achieved internally as a coherent pattern emerges in long-term memory. To go beyond my sketch of IBSEN, future modelers must develop computational models (whether at the schema and/or neural network level).
