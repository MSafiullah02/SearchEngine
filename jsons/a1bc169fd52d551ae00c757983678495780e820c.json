As of 15 March 2020, 22,512 cases have been reported in Italy, 2,026 (9%) of which are healthcare workers. 1 Unfortunately, rates for intensive care unit admission with the need for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are approximately 5% in patients with COVID-19. 2 Given the rapid growth of this outbreak and the need to minimize morbidity in healthcare workers, it is paramount that healthcare professionals be familiar with both the definition of a high-risk exposure and the correct donning and doffing procedures for the protective personal equipment (PPE) needed during the care of these patients.",

Qualitative mask-fit testing should ideally be performed in advance, as correct face mask and size are needed to ensure a proper seal. Facial hair at the face-mask interface promotes seal leakage and may decrease protection. 4 We strongly recommend shaving facial hair. 2. Gloving: Although not needed to be sterile, always use extended-cuff gloves. Ensuring that the most distal part of the gown's sleeve is covered snugly by the glove is paramount to preventing hand and forearm contamination ( Figure A ).",
