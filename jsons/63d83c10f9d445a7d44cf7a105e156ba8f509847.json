Cell culture systems highly permissive for the Flaviviridae viruses are very useful for their isolation, propagation, and diagnosis, an understanding of their biology, and the development of vaccines and antiviral agents.

In brief, cell monolayers grown in 12-well plates (Corning Costar 1 ; No. 3513) were inoculated with virus samples in 0.4 ml per well of culture medium with reduced heat-inactivated FBS (2%) and were incubated at 37\u02daC for 2 h. After removal of the samples, the cells were incubated in 2 ml of overlay medium consisting of EMEM (Nissui Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan; No.05901), 0.22% (w/v) NaHCO 3 , 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque; No. 16948-04), and 1% (w/v) methylcellulose (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan; No. M0185) at 37\u02daC for 5 days. The cells were fixed with 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries; No. 133-10311) and stained with 0.0375% (w/v) methylene blue. Wells with 10\u2212100 plaques were used to calculate the virus titer in plaque formation units (PFU) . For the comparative plaque assay, cells were similarly grown and infected, but overlaid with 2.5 ml per well of DMEM (Nissui Pharmaceuticals; No. 05919) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) NaHCO 3, 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque; No. 04260-64), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1.25% (w/v) methylcellulose. JEV plaque formation in Vero cells was not so different between the DMEM overlay medium and the EMEM overlay medium (S1B Fig). After fixation and staining, plates were scanned with a document scanner, and image data were obtained (S11 Fig). To improve plaque visibility, an invert filter was applied to the image data, and highlights were adjusted using Photoshop Elements (version 14; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).",

Cells were infected with JEV (Nakayama strain, unless otherwise noted), and then the amount of infectious virus particles (titer) in culture supernatant and JEV-induced cell death were monitored during 1\u22124 d pi. The relative JEV titer of these cell lines increased and peaked at 2\u22123 d pi in a similar manner ( Fig 1A) . Under the same seeding conditions, doubling times of Huh7.5.1-8, Huh7.5.1, and HuH-7 cells were not significantly different (after Bonferroni correction, p > 0.0167) (S2B Fig) . Thus, JEV production appeared to be comparable between the three cell lines and not enhanced in this lineage unlike for HCV production. In a parallel cell viability assay (Fig 1B) , susceptibility to JEVinduced cell death was not greatly different between the three cell lines. Next, these cell lines were infected with JEV, overlaid with methylcellulose-containing medium, and then compared regarding JEV plaque formation. Huh7.5.1-8 and Huh7.5.1 cells similarly developed JEV plaques, whereas HuH-7 cells began to die at 3 d pi and detached from the surface of the well irrespective of infection at 5 d pi ( Fig 1C) . These results indicated that the Huh7.5.1-8 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines are better than the HuH-7 cell line for a JEV plaque assay. Although Huh7.5.1-8 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines were comparable in terms of JEV infection, the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line has the advantage of being phenotypically more stable than the Huh7.5.1 cell line [20] . Thus, we hereafter focused on the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line and compared it with the Vero cell line regarding JEV production.",

The difference in the relative virus titer was remarkable in high-cell-density infection (Fig 2A) compared with low-cell-density infection ( Fig 2B) , implying that cell-cell contacts promote viral spread in Huh7.5.1-8 cells. The difference in the titer was not accounted for by the growth rates of the two cell lines, because their doubling times under high confluency conditions were nearly equal (S2 Fig). A parallel viability assay showed that Huh7.5.1-8 cells lost viability faster than Vero cells irrespective of cell density (Fig 3) . The same trends were observed in JEV production and cell viability at smaller MOI (0.01), although high confluency appeared to be needed (S5 Fig) .

Both virus particles showed a similar particle-to-PFU ratio, ruling out the possibility that Huh7.5.1-8-derived virus particles had a higher infectivity than Vero-derived ones. The reason for large variations found at 2 and 3 d pi remains unknown, but that at 3 d pi may have been partly due to variable amounts of non-infectious viral RNA leaking from dead Huh7.5.1-8 cells (Fig 3) . In a representative experiment (S6 Fig) , the actual value of the particle-to-PFU ratio was minimally~600, which is roughly consistent with a previous report [26] . Taken together with the results of Fig 2, these results suggested that Huh7.5.1-8 cells produce a higher amount of JEV particles than Vero cells during early infection times. Next, we compared the JEV replication kinetics between Huh7.5.1-8 and Vero cells by monitoring intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels during 0\u221273 h pi. An initial rise in intracellular viral RNA level in Huh7.5.1-8 cells was detected as early as 9 h pi, whereas the rise for Vero cells was not remarkable during 0-12 h pi (Fig 5A [a]) . Similarly, the level of extracellular viral RNA from Huh7.5.1-8 cells rose earlier than that from Vero cells (Fig 5B  [a] ). Although the level of intracellular viral RNA was not different between the two cell lines after 12 h pi (Fig 5A [b] ), the level of extracellular viral RNA was higher for Huh7.5.1-8 cells than for Vero cells during 12\u221248 h pi (Fig 5B [b] ). Furthermore, the relative amount of extracellular viral RNA expressed as a percentage of the total (extracellular plus intracellular) amount of viral RNA was about 2-fold higher in Huh7.5.1-8 cells than in Vero cells at 1 d pi (Fig 6) . Thereafter, the value for Huh7.5.1-8 cells varied with each experiment, possibly due to variation in virus-induced cell death, but leading to no difference between the values for For both panels, bars with error bars represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.

(C) Cells were seeded at 4 x 10 5 cells per well of a 12-well plate one day before infection and then infected with JEV at 40 PFU (determined with Vero cells) per well.

Similar results were observed when the cells were infected with another JEV strain, rAT (Fig 7B and  S7B Fig) . These results showed that the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line supports more rapid JEV plaque formation than the Vero cell line. The rapid plaque formation in Huh7.5.1-8 cells appears to reflect their high JEV productivity and susceptibility to JEV-induced cell death. The plaque numbers of the Nakayama strain at 5 d pi were comparable between the two cell lines (Fig 7A  and S7A Fig), whereas those of the rAT strain tended to be higher in the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line than in the Vero cell line (Fig 7B and S7B Fig) . These results indicated that the difference in plaque numbers between the two cell lines varies by each virus strain. Fig 2, and the culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated times. RNA was extracted and purified from each culture supernatant, and viral RNA copy number in the supernatant was determined by qRT-PCR and regarded as the number of virus particles. A virus titer in PFU of each culture supernatant was also determined by plaque assay, and particle-to-PFU ratio was calculated. Each symbol represents the relative value calculated by dividing the value of Huh7.5.1-8-derived JEV by that of Vero-derived JEV obtained from the same experiment. Bars with error bars represent the mean \u00b1 SD of the ratio from eight (1 and 2 d pi) or seven (3 d pi) independent experiments (the reason for the different sample sizes was that one experiment lacked data for 3 d pi). Statistical significance was determined by a one-sample t test. Values in parentheses indicate p values, and those less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. (Fig 8C and 8D) . The combined data showed that virus yield in Huh7.5.1-8 cells was significantly higher than that in Vero cells for high confluency at 2 d pi and low confluency at 1 and 2 d pi. Furthermore, Huh7.5.1-8 cells were more susceptible to YFV-induced cell death than Vero cells (Fig 8E and 8F ), as observed with JEV. These results suggested that the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line, compared with the Vero cell line, has a higher virus productivity and susceptibility to virus-induced cell death upon flavivirus infection. Next, we compared the YFV plaque formation between the two cell lines (Fig 9 and S9  Fig) . YFV plaques began to appear at 4 d pi in both cell lines. Although plaques in Huh7.5.1-8 cells were slightly smaller than those in Vero cells, Huh7.5.1-8 cells developed a several fold higher number of YFV plaques than Vero cells. These results suggested that the high YFV productivity and susceptibility to YFV-induced cell death of Huh7.5.1-8 cells can be mainly attributed to their high infection efficiency. Although YFV plaques developed in Vero cells at 4 d pi in Fig 9, no cell death was observed with these cells at this time point in Fig 8E and 8F . A possible explanation for this discrepancy in cell death may be the difference in culture conditions: The serum concentration was 10% for Fig 8 and 2% for Fig 9. In addition, the medium In the case of JEV, the lower the serum concentration is, the more cell death occurs [27] .",

Unlike the Huh7.5.1-8 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, the HuH-7 cell line was not maintained under our culture conditions for the plaque assay (Fig 1C) , likely because our HuH-7 cells had a lower fitness to cell culture than Huh7.5.1-8 and Huh7.5.1 cells.",

First, Huh7.5.1-8 cells produced higher amounts of infectious JEV and YFV than Vero cells early in infection (Figs 2 and 8A-8D ). In the case of JEV, the high virus productivity of Huh7.5.1-8 cells may be attributed not to the increase in infectivity of a virus particle (Fig 4) , but to viral rapid replication kinetics and efficient virus release early in infection (Figs 5 and 6) . Therefore, Huh7.5.1-8 cells are more suitable than Vero cells for obtaining large amounts of flavivirus in a short period of time. Recently, HuH-7 cells were shown to produce higher amounts of Zika virus than other cells including Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) early in infection [29] . Considering that JEV production in Huh7.5.1-8 cells and the ancestral HuH-7 cells were comparable (Fig 1A) , high virus productivity early in flavivirus infection may be a common feature among the HuH-7 lineage. In addition, a similar trend was observed when HuH-7 cells were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [30] . Thus, the feature may not be limited to flavivirus infection.",

At present, the underlying mechanisms that generate splice variants and their impacts on RIG-I signaling remain to be studied. Although JEV has been restricted by RIG-I in a mouse model [31] and mouse cell lines [32, 33] , JEV production and susceptibility to JEV-induced cell death were not dramatically altered in the Huh7.5.1-8 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines compared with the HuH-7 cell line (Fig 1A and 1B) , implying that the RIG-I pathway may not work or may be counteracted by viral mechanisms [34] under our experimental conditions.",

Further study is needed to investigate the potential versatility of the Huh7. the culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated times. RNA was extracted and purified from each culture supernatant, and viral RNA copy number in the supernatant was determined by qRT-PCR. A virus titer in PFU of each culture supernatant was also determined by plaque assay, and particle-to-PFU ratio was calculated. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of triplicates from one representative experiment. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired two-tailed t test. Values in parentheses indicate p values, and those less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Huh, Huh7. (SV1, 2) .
