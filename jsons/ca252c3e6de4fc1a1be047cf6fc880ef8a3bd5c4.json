This concept was analyzed using the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) epidemiological model and illustrated in the GLEAMviz software (Gleamviz.org, 2019). In detail, demographics and mobility data were incorporated with epidemic modeling, aiming to predict accurately the number of infections invaded by flight or by commuting. For this reason, several experiments have been analyzed using the GLEAMviz epidemic simulation model. The most frequently used epidemic models used in such cases are the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model (Song, 2017) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. The analytical approach followed in this paper, started by the implementation of three scenarios of SIR models for identifying disease-spreading dynamics at a continental level. Every scenario considered different values of recovery rate (\u03bc) and transmission rates (\u03b2) parameters. The scenarios studied hypothetical disease outbreaks originated from the busiest airports of three continents, namely, Africa (Scenario 1), Asia (Scenario 2) and South America (Scenario 3). In detail, the airports that were concerned for each continent are listed below and presented in Fig. 1 The purpose of developing these scenarios was the estimation of the possible disease outbreak dynamics within the European region when the outbreak originates from the three different continents.

Starting from January 2020 when Italy detected its first coronavirus cases, and based on the evolution of this virus after almost two months, it turned out that the COVID-19 virus spreading in Italy was extremely severe and thousands of people were infected and many of them lost their lives (Who.int, 2020) .

Millions of peoples are crossing continents on a daily basis, a fact that has enhanced the speed of disease spreading, making the possibility of disease outbreak within days a realistic scenario. Air travel belongs to one of the means that can rapidly spread a disease to a global scale (Findlater and Bogoch, 2018) . Therefore, there is a need for understanding and predicting the patterns that diseases follow as they spread on a regional or global scale. Consequently, spreading-control and quarantine-based actions remain the main tools for public health authorities in combatting epidemics. For this reason, several efforts have been conducted studying the dynamic disease spreading incorporating several factors, such as the distance between regional and human mobility behavior (e.g. Wu et al., 2018) , network topologies, length of stay, etc. However, analyzing the dynamic spread of diseases on an international level may not be enough for concluding to the measures that will work as travel restrictions. Therefore, is critical to analyze the complexity of the networks for observing which vertices (airports) are more \"sensitive\" to a possible disease spread. In this scope, several studies have been implemented for analyzing the complexity of networks (Angeloudis and Fisk, 2006; Matamalas et al., 2018; Brockmann and Helbing, 2013) . Additionally, Strona et al. (2018) studied the vulnerability of networks to epidemics and found that the density of infection pathways had a stronger effect on outbreak magnitude than the epidemic parameters when a broad range of network topology is considered. Furthermore, it is found that as the length of stay (an element of exposure to a possible threat) increases in highly connected locations the epidemic spread is expected to have an acceleration, depending also on the dominant role of the hubs either wise the spreading potential of the hubs is substantially reduced, delaying the epidemic spreading (Poletto et al., 2013) . In Li et al., 2018 paper, they identified a weak relationship between population density and the death rate due to epidemics. Additionally, population density is closely dependent on the time and the rate of disease spreading. In Enright and Kao, 2018 work, the author defined methods based on network dynamics for modeling epidemic spreading among specialists, and thus highlighted the opportunities and difficulties in working within a disease-relevant network, while suggesting available software tools for conducting a similar analysis. Focusing on the meta-population epidemic dynamics, precautionary controlling actions has been proven critical to epidemic spreading. Therefore, several approaches have been proposed and tested in the real world, such as to reduce spreading rates (Gong et al., 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 429, "text": "(Findlater and Bogoch, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 905, "end": 921, "text": "Wu et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1406, "text": "(Angeloudis and Fisk, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1430, "text": "Matamalas et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1459, "text": "Brockmann and Helbing, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1496, "text": "Strona et al.

Therefore, for accurately predicting epidemic spreading dynamics it is important to identify these parameters. For instance, Wang et al. (2013) estimated the transmission rate from the infected cases at the whole population level and have introduced a maximum likelihood estimator for estimating the diffusion rate (the probability that infected in a subpopulation diffuse to a neighbor susceptible subpopulation). In Merler and Ajelli, 2010 paper they studied the epidemic transmission rate in households, schools, workplaces and the general population of 37 European countries. In detail, they found that the cumulative attack rate in the different European countries had a range from 31.2% (Bulgaria) to 37.8% (Cyprus) and the average cumulative rate was 33.7%. Connectivity patterns between distant locations have a significant role in the epidemic spreading dynamics. No doubt, air transportation plays the main role of passengers' travel flows and thus it is important studying the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network, which may act as a medium for spreading emerging disease, mainly due to exposure conditions evident in long hour flights (Colizza et al., 2006) . Epidemic spreading forecasts aim to predict the real-time spread of a disease, i.e., the number of infected on a regional and international level and therefore to advocate policy-making measures in order to prevent a possible disease spreading.

Major airports globally, are becoming hubs in this disease spreading networks and from these nodes connecting alternative modes of transportation, may facilitate the further spreading of infectious diseases on a national and international level. Therefore, identifying critical nodes (airports) in the network of airports is essential, especially for designing and applying measures for preventing disease spreading. Essential information for developing epidemiological models stand for the demographic data of the countries in a fine-grained manner, human mobility patterns and stochastic models of disease transmission.

As resulted from the above analysis, the European region is mostly affected by a disease spreading when the disease starts from Africa for every recovered rate. However, the disease is mostly transmitted inside the European region when the transmission rate equals \u03b2 \u00bc 1, meaning that when an infected individual comes in contact with a healthy individual the healthy individual will surely contact the disease with a possibility of 100%. Table 4 presents an overview of the total number of infected and recovered individuals during a year as predicted by the GLEAMviz simulator inside the European continents concerning the different scenarios developed. The total number of infected depicted in this table denote all the following categories: people that have visited Europe as infected; and residents inside the European region that got infected from others. As concerns the total number of recovered the following categories are included: people that have visited the European region as infected and were recovered during their stay in Europe; and residents of Europe that were infected and recovered. The number of recoveries does not include the number of people that were infected during their stay in Europe and travelled outside the European continent and got recovered.

This can be interpreted as that infected people that were recovered outside the European continent, travelled after their recovery to Europe and therefore are registered as recovered.

Special focus was given to the city of Frankfurt, where its airports are identified as critical concerning the Degree and Betweenness Centrality metrics. As can be seen on day 6 of the simulation (disease outbreak), the first infected passengers were traveling from the airports of Mahe Island, Johannesburg, and Marrakech and for the last two airports, Lyon's airport was the destination. From this trip, 1 infection was recorded in Lyon. On day 16 the first infection was recorded in the city of Frankfurt from a flight that was originated from Mahe Island on day 14. On day 25, 331 infections were recorded in the city of Frankfurt and as it appeared the disease was spread not only through air mobility but also through the roadway. In day 38 Frankfurt recorded a higher number of infections (91.888 people). In day 43 Europe faced an outbreak of the disease where the highest number of diseases was recorded while in Frankfurt the number of diseases was reduced drastically (34,134 infections per 1000 individuals). After that day the number of diseases was reduced and eliminated in day 84 for Frankfurt. In day 365 the infected population in Europe and the entire world were recovered from the disease. Extending the above analysis, it was considered important to design and test gating strategies that could prevent a disease outbreak in Europe. Therefore, the next steps involve the testing of two challenging scenarios for an aggressive virus with transmission rate \u03b2 \u00bc 0.1 and recovery rate equal \u03bc \u00bc 0.1. In the first scenario the hypothesis of nocontrol policies in Europe was tested when a disease outbreak started from Africa (worst-case scenario). This scenario was followed by series of cases, were measures are taken. In particular, the measures that were set first were in the identified critical airports and then in the countries where the critical airports are located.

In detail, this hypothesis was tested against one of the worst-case scenarios, which was a disease outbreak from the busiest African airports with a recovery rate of \u03bc \u00bc 0.1 and transmission rate equals to \u03b2 \u00bc 1, which appeared from Table 4 to record the highest number of infections in Europe. However, in order to monitor diseased passengers and for setting gating actions to a possible disease outbreak or a pandemic, we made an exception in the simulation by setting a different transmission rate for the European region. In detail, the transmission rate used was \u03b2 \u00bc 0.1, which appeared to have zero infections for the case of Europe in every case scenario and represent the case of the application of gating measures. In this way, it is able to estimate the Fig. 9 .

The last implementation tested the capability of airports' gating and passengers' monitoring strategies and their effects on the restriction of a possible disease spreading. Therefore, knowing the critical nodes in the airports' network and the origin of the disease that will affect the European region, it is important to test strategic measures (e.g. passengers monitoring, disease gating scenarios, technological measures for identifying and setting into quarantine infected passengers). In particular, two cases were developed, one for setting barriers directly to the most critical airports and the other one by applying gating strategies in the countries that the critical airports are located. A more obvious picture of the significant decrease of infected individuals can be seen from Figs. 9-11.

In detail, the structure of the paper was developed in a way for investigating the disease spreading phenomena over the globe by examining the complexity of the air transportation network, implementing several stress-tests (scenarios) able to give a clear picture of the phenomenon and setting barriers for possible future disease spreads within the European region. The interest of this analysis was the observation of critical airports and the scenarios that will denote the highest impact inside the European region. The objective of this paper was to highlight possible disease spreading in the European region and to advocate the enhancement of Europe's control measures in order to prevent a disease spreading inside the region. The integration of a basic but valid epidemiological model with realistic airline operations and the existing land transportation system, form a detailed dynamic simulation able to reproduce the outbreaks of infectious diseases as these emerge almost in yearly fashion. This controlled simulation framework is able to identify critical nodes in the airline system (i.e. airports with a high possibility to transfer and spread the infectious disease among distant locations), an element of immense importance in policy-making for controlling such phenomena. The results from extensive stress-test focusing in the European continent, suggests that Europe indeed plays a central role in controlling epidemics, but also, it is proven robust in such cases if immediate actions are taken in the first steps of the epidemic phenomenon.
