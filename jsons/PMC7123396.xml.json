True OSA results in detrimental clinical sequelae such as failure to thrive, behavior problems, learning problems, and cardiovascular disease.Criteria for OSA: clinically relevant symptoms and an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) > 1 or hypoventilation (CO2 > 50 mmHg for > 25% total sleep time) as determined on polysomnogram (PSG)\n\nOSA syndrome affects 2\u201310% of children; adenotonsillar hypertrophy as a primary driver of OSA is most common between ages 2 and 6 years of age.\n\nNocturnal\u2014snoring, mouth breathing, pauses in breathing, enuresis, gasping or choking, restless/awakenings:Children may still have OSA without snoring.Daytime: inappropriate sleepiness, inattention/learning problems, hyperactivity/aggression, irritability.Children with OSA during infancy are more likely to have a risk factor other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity, such as craniofacial abnormality, neurologic problems, and genetic syndrome.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening by history (snoring, daytime symptoms) during well-child checks.Focused sleep history.Physical exam\u2014vitals including blood pressure; craniofacial, oral, nasal, and oropharyngeal exams; growth curve; and BMI should be recorded:Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity are the major causes in otherwise healthy children.Usually there is evidence of large tonsils, but small tonsils may cause symptoms during sleep; adenoids are best visualized by nasal endoscopy.Strongest risk factor for OSA in adolescence is obesity.If there\u2019s normal weight and small tonsils/adenoids, otolaryngology will look for more rare causes of obstruction such as laryngeal masses, lingual tonsillar hypertrophy, macroglossia, abnormal pharyngeal tone, and nasoseptal obstruction.PSG\u2014gold standard for definitive diagnosis (also requires presence of clinical symptoms) and can help to inform treatment decisions and counsel caregivers:If there\u2019s clinical suspicion without high-risk features (see below), offer PSG rather than referral (otolaryngology, pulmonology, sleep medicine physician)If there are high-risk features, PSG in a facility experienced with children and referral are recommended:Obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, mucopolysaccharidoses, Prader-Willi syndrome, sickle cell disease, Down syndrome, neuromuscular disorders, congenital hypoventilation syndrome, etc.Classification based on AHI: mild OSA (1\u20134.9), moderate OSA (5\u20139.9), severe (greater than 10) \n\nTonsillectomy and adenoidectomy\u2014otherwise healthy children with OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy:Consideration of clinical symptoms, OSA severity, comorbidities.Obese children may experience weight gain after surgery.Supportive care with watchful waiting\u2014mild OSA, mild symptoms, and reevaluation in 6 months:Data based on Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT) [13]Positive airway pressure therapy: minimal anatomic reason for obstruction, poor surgical candidate, need to stabilize/optimize the patient prior to surgery, persistent OSA after tonsillectomy/adenoidectomyRapid maxillary expansion\n\n",

Ultrasound should be performed to confirm the presence of a normal thyroid in its expected location.The most common congenital lesion of the larynx is laryngomalacia; most children will outgrow the diagnosis by 24 months of age.Cough, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea are more common with viral than with bacterial pharyngitis.The diagnostic gold standard for bacterial pharyngitis is a throat culture.Diagnosis of PTA is a clinical diagnosis based on history (double worsening, URI symptoms > 5 days prior to new symptoms) and physical exam (hot potato voice, trismus, uvular deviation)The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for OSA by history (snoring, daytime symptoms) during well-child checks. Symptoms may include irritability, hyperactivity, daytime sleepiness, and nocturnal enuresis; this is a different constellation of symptoms than in adult patients.Ankyloglossia often manifests as discomfort in the mother\u2019s nipples.Children with cleft palate are at an increased risk of developing Eustachian tube dysfunction resulting in OME and recurrent AOM.Eruption cysts present as blue or purple compressible cysts at the site of an erupting deciduous or permanent tooth.
