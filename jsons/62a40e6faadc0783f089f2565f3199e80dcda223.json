            "text": "As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic hits Europe, it converges and interacts with three global crises that will make it spread even further: governance, economics, and migration. 1 Although these crises have different roots, all three reflect a lack of mechanisms to produce and protect essential public goods for an effective policy response. Understanding how these crises intersect and the scope of a potential transnational Europe-wide response is crucial. Turning first to governance, the ongoing and devastating pandemic is exposing the limits of not only national preparedness and mitigation policies, but also transnational governance systems to organise and administer public goods, such as health-care support. As Italy's outbreak accelerated, on Feb 26, 2020, the country's leaders appealed for additional personal protective equipment and ventilators to the EU's crisis hub, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre. 2 Only by mid-March did EU member states begin sending supplies, by which point China was already providing medical experts, supplies and equipment. 3 The second crisis is economic; the recession accompanying the coronavirus pandemic will lead to spikes in unemployment and lost income, especially among those countries who are already in precarious positions. A decade of austerity following the 2007-08 financial crisis has had devastating detrimental health and social effects, 4,5 and has rendered disadvantaged groups even more vulnerable to the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. To date, no EU-wide social protection shield or minimum social floor exists. Additionally, those who have the most economic difficulties may not be able to adhere to physical distancing effectively, as they seek to continue to work, worsening the risks of virus transmission. The public health systems in several EU countries-still with reduced capacity due to austerity measures-face important limitations in effectively responding to the pandemic.",

Attempts to settle asylum seekers and refugees across Europe have failed 6 and revealed the limited solidarity within the EU. Border countries like Italy or Greece are struggling to handle the situation, partly due to the inadequate financial, technical, and institutional support from other European countries. The pandemic presents a further complication, as funds are being diverted away from refugee services, 7 and some have blamed migrants for importing disease. 8 Possible SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in overcrowded, understaffed, and under-resourced refugee facilities could become health disasters.",

National strategies will not be enough, as dysfunctional responses to crises are partly caused by the lack of effective supranational mechanisms for providing public goods. As subnational borders, and then national borders began shutting down and the EU became the epicentre of the pandemic, supranational coordination, governance, and reciprocal distributive measures-eg, for the co-production of public goods-are needed more than ever. An effective and reciprocal distributive EU response mechanism must ensure that economic, social, technological, and health resources are shared more equally and in a spirit of solidarity among EU member states.",
