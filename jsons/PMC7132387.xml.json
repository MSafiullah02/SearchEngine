The annual incidence of LASV infection ranges from 100,000\u2013300,000 cases, and associated mortality is between 5000 and 10,000 deaths per year [2,3]. Lassa fever is endemic to several West African countries. Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria are most heavily affected; however, LASV infections have also been detected throughout the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Ghana, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, and southern Mali [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. As a nonspecific febrile illness with a high proportion of asymptomatic cases, LASV infection is often unreported or misdiagnosed, precluding accurate determination of its true burden.",

            "text": "LASV belongs to the Arenaviridae family; it is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a bisegmented, ambisense genome [1]. The virus is spherical in shape with a diameter ranging between 70 and 150 nm. The envelope surface is smooth with T-shaped glycoprotein spikes, and encloses the genome containing the helical nucleocapsid of 400\u20131300 nm in length [1]. The viral genome consists of a large (L) and small (S) RNA fragment, 3.4 and 7 kb in size, respectively [10]. The L fragment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a small, zinc-binding (Z) protein [11]. Meanwhile, the S fragment encodes the viral glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and the nucleoprotein (NP) [12,13]. The glycoprotein (GP) spike complex drives host cell entry [14]. The mature form of GP is a trimer of heterodimers, each containing the receptor-binding subunit GP1 and the transmembrane, fusion-mediating subunit GP2 [15]. GPC also encodes a stable signal peptide (SSP) that aids in polyprotein processing into GP1 and GP2, regulation of the pH of infectivity, and provision of chaperone functions during GP maturation [16]. As the only antigen displayed on the viral surface, GP has been the focus of recent LASV antiviral and vaccine research. Structural analyses of GP indicate that it is a primary target for neutralising antibody binding [17,18]. However, the role of NP-specific T cells in controlling acute infection and mediating heterosubtypic immunity in animal models and Lassa fever patients, offers some justification for the inclusion of NP in LASV vaccines [[19], [20], [21]].",

            "text": "LASV is a zoonotic pathogen, which circulates in rodent reservoirs. For several decades, the natal multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, was assumed to be the only host of LASV [2]. However, recent evidence indicates that LASV circulates in other rodent species. In fact, the isolation of LASV from the African wood mouse, Hylomyscus pamfi, in Nigeria and the Guinea multimammate mouse, Mastomys erythroleucus, in Nigeria and Guinea, revealed previously undiscovered LASV strains and the identification of new a phylogenetic lineage [22]. In these rodents, the virus exhibits persistent, asymptomatic infection. Due to their ubiquitous geographic distribution across the West African region, the population-at-risk for Lassa fever is estimated at nearly 60 million people [3,4,7]. LASV fever cases are typically the result of rodent-to-human transmission events, facilitated by contact with infectious rodent urine or faeces in the household environment [2]. This human-vector interface predominantly occurs in resource-limited communities, where access to health care and laboratory diagnostic testing is scarce. Therefore, it is thought that many potential cases of infection are never tested [3]. Human-to-human transmission of the virus is observed, but is most often confined to nosocomial outbreaks [2,3]. In addition to implementing vector-control strategies, vaccination is a key approach to preventing and controlling Lassa fever outbreaks.",

The emergence of lineage V was elucidated through the phylogenetic analysis of strains from Mali and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire [25]. Meanwhile, recently discovered strain Kako, putatively classified as lineage VI, was isolated from Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria. [22].

The dramatic increase in cases during the 2018 Nigerian Lassa fever season launched investigations into the possible emergence of a new strain with a higher transmission rate [28,29]. Two sequencing studies, analysing 220 and 120 LASV genomes from infected patients, revealed high variability and derivation from previously circulating viruses rather than from a single dominant strain [29,30]. The data did not indicate phylogenetic clustering of LASV from samples collected at similar time points, which would be expected in the event of increased human-to-human transmission. Therefore, Lassa virus transmission continues to principally occur via independent cross-species transmission events [29,30]. No clear reason for the increase in Lassa fever cases has been found; changes in the distribution of the rodent reservoir population or improved disease diagnosis and surveillance remain possible explanations [30].",

The virus primarily targets myeloid lineage cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [40,41]. These cell types support high levels of viral replication. LASV infection antagonizes the activation and maturation of APC resulting in impaired antigen processing and presentation. Despite the fact that infected APC migrate to the draining lymph nodes, their maturation remains impeded throughout the course of LASV infection, causing dysregulation of the adaptive immune response and reduced viral clearance [40,41]. The more complete disruption of the function of APC by LASV may correlate with the lack of adaptive immune responses observed in fatal cases. The presentation of LASV antigens by immature DCs may lead to immune tolerance and ultimately immunosuppression [40,41].",

In contrast, T-cell responses were undetectable in animals developing fatal disease based on the expression of T-cell activation markers, CD69 and CD25, and the proliferation marker, Ki67 [47]. In the NHP model of Lassa fever, severe disease is associated with T-cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissues, transient lymphopenia, decreased T-cell proliferation, and uncontrolled virus replication [47]. In humans, LASV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are activated early during infection and continue to be detected after recovery despite a low or absent antibody response [49]. Memory CD4+ T-cell responses against LASV GPC and NP persist for several years after initial infection [49].",

Neutralising antibodies are detectable months after the resolution of acute infection and titres are initially low [48]. Neutralising antibody titres continue to rise months after convalescence, perhaps due to low levels of persisting virus that continue to stimulate B cells [48]. In seroconverted individuals, antibodies are primarily specific to GP and NP. Structural studies of B-cell antigenic epitopes have identified two binding sites on GP1, six sites on GP2, and four sites on NP [17,54]. The structure of the glycan shield of LASV GP has been implicated as a barrier to the induction of neutralising antibodies during infection, thus potentially limiting the role of B-cell responses in protection [55].",

The monoclonal antibodies used in these studies had a high neutralising index, potentially suggesting that a strong neutralising response may be protective even though neutralising antibodies are not extensively produced during natural infection [56,57]. Finally, a recent study of an inactivated LASV and rabies virus vaccine has provided evidence for the role of non-neutralising antibodies in virus clearance via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in an in vitro model of infection [58].

Pathogenicity differs based on host strain and virus strain. Intraperitoneal infection with Josiah strain LASV produces a uniformly lethal disease in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs characterised by fever, weight loss, and death within two weeks. Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and reduced levels of serum albumin are also observed [64,65]. Viraemia is first detectable four days after infection and peaks 10\u201312 days after infection. High viral titres are found in lymph nodes, salivary glands, spleen, pancreas, and lungs; viral replication is also detected in the liver, heart, brain, kidney, and adrenal glands. LASV infection in guinea pigs may be more myocardiotropic and less hepatotropic than in humans [64,65]. In Hartley guinea pigs, the lethality of Josiah strain LASV infection varies from 30% to over 60%. Viral titres are lower in Hartley guinea pigs and viral replication is limited in comparison with inbred animals [64,65]. Recently, a lethal model of Lassa fever in outbred Hartley guinea pigs was developed after four passages Josiah strain LASV in the host strain [66]. After intraperitoneal inoculation with 1 \u00d7 104TCID50 of LASV, animals uniformly succumbed to disease by 15 days post-infection. Clinical manifestations of LASV infection resembled those observed in the inbred guinea pig model [66]. The new lethal Hartley guinea pig model is currently being applied to vaccine efficacy studies.",

A vaccinia-NYBH-vectored vaccine encoding Josiah strain LASV NP conferred 94% protection against homologous virus challenge in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs. Meanwhile, in the same study, vaccinia-NYBH encoding Josiah strain LASV GPC protected only 79% of immunised guinea pigs [75]. However, when vaccinia-NYBH-GPC was evaluated in a homologous challenge experiment in rhesus macaques, 100% protective efficacy was observed [76]. These studies first indicated that guinea pig models of infection may not be entirely predictive of responses in NHPs. A study comparing vaccinia-NYBH vaccines in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs expressing different regions of Josiah strain LASV GPC and NP, revealed that full length GPC, including both GP1 and GP2 subunits, are necessary for protection against LASV challenge [75]. A follow-up investigation in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques indicated that vaccination with both GPC and NP antigens provided a modest increase (88% versus 90%) in protection compared to vaccination with GPC alone [77].",

Thus, they maintain the preferred safety profile of \u2018killed\u2019 vaccines while possessing greater immunogenicity. Immunogenicity studies of RNA replicons derived from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) show that the vector serves as an adjuvant to promote CD8+ T cells responses to the delivered antigen, which is a particularly attractive feature for LASV vaccine design [53]. VEEV RNA replicons, expressing either GPC or NP of Josiah strain LASV, fully protected inbred strain 13 guinea pigs from lethal infection with Josiah strain LASV [82]. However, three doses of VEEV were required to achieve protection, which while meeting the minimum requirements of WHO TPP, would be far more difficult to deploy in LASV-endemic regions that are rural or limited in their infrastructure than a single-dose vaccine. However, a multi-dose immunisation regimen may be more feasible to administer to certain groups, such as healthcare professionals or military personnel, who would be accessible for follow-up at the designated intervals. Recently, a multivalent VEEV vaccine encoding LASV GPC (LASV VLPV) from distantly related strains, LP (lineage I) and Josiah (lineage IV) was developed [53]. LASV VLPV was protective in inbred CBA/J mice and upregulated CD11c+/CD8+ dendritic cells were implicated as playing a major role in cross-presentation. Vaccination resulted in induction of cross-reactive multifunctional T-cell responses after stimulation of immune splenocytes with peptide cocktails derived from LASV lineages I\u2014IV [53].",

Older adults received either ChAdOx1 NP + M1 alone (n = 12) or ChAdOx1 NP + M1 and MVA-NP + M1 administered eight weeks apart (n = 12). Subjects were monitored for 18 months to record adverse effects and measure T-cell responses. ChAdOx1 NP + M1 was found to be safe and well tolerated. No serious vaccine-related adverse effects were recorded and a lower proportion of older adults experienced adverse effects than younger adults. All immunisation regimens were found to boost pre-existing levels of T cells at all ages. Greater amplification was observed after heterologous prime-boost vaccination than after prime-only vaccination [113].",

Children (n = 138) were enrolled according to the following age groups: 2\u20136 years in The Gambia, 5\u201317 months old in Burkina Faso, 5\u201312 months old in The Gambia, and 10 weeks old in The Gambia. Within each group, multiple combinations of low or high doses of the viral vectors were tested. The vaccine was well tolerated in all four cohorts of children. Adverse effects were mild in intensity, dose dependent, and resolved quickly. The prime-boost immunisation regimen was found to be highly immunogenic in young children, with the highest levels of antigen-specific T cells measured in 10-week old infants [114].",

The ability of ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines to be thermostabilised for extended periods of time, without significant loss of potency, makes the application of the platform towards emerging pathogens vaccine development especially advantageous. A ChAdOx1 Rift Valley Fever vaccine (ChAdOx1-GnGc) encoding the viral envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc was thermostabilised via desiccation on glass fibre membranes in trehalose and sucrose sugars. ChAdOx1-GnGc was then stored for 6 months at 25, 37, 45, or 55 \u00b0C. Immunogenicity of the vaccines was determined by measuring neutralising antibody titres in immunised cattle in comparison to those elicited by a standard cold-chain vaccine. Animals vaccinated with thermostabilised ChAdOx1-GnGc stored for 6 months at 25, 37 or 45 \u00b0C mounted a functional antibody response comparable to those receiving the cold-chain vaccine at the same dose; titres were within the range associated with protection against RVF in cattle [117].",

Although efficacy has been demonstrated in animal models, ChAdOx1-based vaccines have yet to complete efficacy assessments in humans. Extended durability of vaccine-mediated immune responses have yet to be evaluated. Furthermore, as ChAdOx1 vaccines are under development for multiple co-endemic infections, including Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease, and Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the risk of reduced vaccine efficacy due to anti-vector immunity resulting from previous ChAdOx1 vaccination should be investigated. Careful consideration of these challenges and further study will be required before ChAdOx1-Lassa-GP, or any ChAdOx1-based vaccine candidate, can progress to licensure and deployment. ChAdOx1-Lassa-GP may be useful in both non-emergency and outbreak settings, as it is expected to be effective after a single dose.",

With the augmented support of entities like CEPI and the WHO, it is likely that multiple Lassa fever vaccine candidates will reach clinical trials within the next few years. In order to feasibly develop, test, manufacture, and distribute vaccines against these diseases, new strategies to reduce development costs must be identified. Use of platforms, like DNA, VSV, MV, and ChAdOx1, with established safety and immunogenicity profiles in humans, will help accelerate early stages of clinical development and decrease manufacturing costs. Whereas opportunities to test the efficacy of novel vaccines against Ebola are few, the number of cases of Lassa fever in West Africa will allow for multiple clinical efficacy trials, which may lead to the licensure and deployment of one or more candidate vaccines. As previously stated, during clinical evaluations, promising vaccine candidates must be identified based on alignment with the WHO TPP.",
