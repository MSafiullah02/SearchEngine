The QPCR assays targeted the 16S rRNA gene in S. maltophilia and Mycobacterium (genus) and the 23S rRNA gene in Streptomyces (genus). Rintala and Nevalainen (2006) chose the 23S rRNA gene as the target gene because it was not possible to find a primer/probe set targeting the 16S rRNA gene that met the criteria of suitability for QPCR assays and specificity at the same time. For the mold analyses, all primer and probe sequences used in the assays can be found online (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2012). Primers and probes were synthesized commercially (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Each QPCR reaction mixture contained 12.5 \u03bcl of \u2018Universal Master Mix\u2019 (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 1 \u03bcl of a mixture of forward and reverse primers at 25 \u03bcM each, 2.5 \u03bcl of a 400 nM TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 2.5 \u03bcl of 2 mg/ml fraction V bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1.5 \u03bcl of DNA\u2010free water (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and 5 \u03bcl of DNA extract from the sample. Assays were performed using the Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 System (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Standard curves for each bacteria/genus were generated from pure cultures of S. maltophilia (ATCC 13637; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA), M. intracellulare (ATCC 700663), and S. anulatus (ATCC 27416) and were ultimately based on hemocytometer counts of cells in the highest concentration in the standard curve. DNA extracted from this highest concentration (as previously described) was used to generate a dilution series for the standard curve. As the QPCR is based on the cells counted in the hemocytometer as the standard, copy number differences are accounted for because the results are expressed as number of cells. The efficiency of amplification calculated from the standard curves was 88% for S. maltophilia, 90% for Mycobacterium, and 79% for Streptomyces (genus). Detection limits, defined at a Ct value of 40, were 32 cells for S. maltophilia, 7 cells for Mycobacterium (genus), and 4 cells for Streptomyces (genus).",

Also, Streptomyces grows as a thread\u2010like network of cells from which spore chains of varying length develop. These spores typically have an aerodynamic diameter ~1.0 \u03bcm (Madelin and Johnson, 1992; Reponen et al., 1996\n). Therefore, it appears that the airborne cells of these bacteria are primarily in aggregates > 1.8 \u03bcm.

The strongest correlation between airborne and dustborne bacterial concentration was for Mycobacterium (r = 0.454), which could be due in part to having fewer air samples below the limit of detection compared with the S. maltophilia and Streptomyces assays. Bacterial dust load, which is the amount of given bacteria per unit area, may be a useful measure of contaminant levels because it represents the total burden of the bacteria in the home (Johansson et al., 2011). However, in our study, more significant associations with home characteristics and airborne concentrations were found for dust concentrations than for loads.
