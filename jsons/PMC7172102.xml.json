One of these children presented in 2014 with isolated leg weakness and was positive for EV A71. The other child presented in late 2016 with 4-extremity weakness in the setting of a febrile illness, and was positive for an un-typed EV in respiratory samples, stool, and urine. Two children, both positive for EV D68, had persistent flaccid quadriplegia requiring tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube at follow-up. Follow-up mRS was significantly higher among children who tested positive for EV D68 compared with those who were negative or not tested (median 4 [n = 6] vs 1 [n = 8]; P = .011). There was no significant difference in follow-up mRS scores between those who did and did not receive steroids (median 1 [n = 7] vs 4 [n = 7]; P = .233). All children received IVIG. Fluoxetine was empirically added to the treatment protocol at our institution in 2016 and administered to 7 of the 9 children that year.

We did, however, find evidence of EV infection in multiple other sites. More children in 2016 had positive EV-specific PCR testing compared with 2014, but a new institutional testing protocol in 2016 ensured rapid procurement of standardized multisite samples in suspected AFM cases, so it is unclear whether this is a true difference or a sampling bias. This observation underscores the importance of rapid sample acquisition in the search for associated pathogens. EV typing in previously reported case series has revealed both D68 and A71 strains in cases of AFM, and anecdotally, children with EV A71 neuroinvasive disease have been reported to have better outcomes than those associated with EV D68.2, 15 Although only one of the children in our case series was positive for EV A71, that child had a good outcome compared with the other children. The 6 children who tested positive for EV D68 had overall poorer outcomes than those who tested negative or were not tested, but it is unclear if other factors may have confounded this association. It is also possible that another unidentified virus may have influenced outcomes, because multiple other viruses, including flaviviruses, adenoviruses, and other types of EV, have also been associated with an AFM phenotype.",

These concerns are based on historical data from human EV A71 outbreaks, in which steroids were felt to worsen clinical course, a murine model of EV D68-associated AFM that found mice treated with high-dose steroids had increased mortality compared with untreated mice, and older poliovirus data demonstrating accelerated poliovirus replication in chick embryos when treated with cortisone.13, 16, 17 However, definitive evidence of an adverse effect has never been clearly shown in humans. These concerns, as well as a perceived lack of efficacy of methylprednisolone in 2016, led to changes in our internal treatment protocol in 2016 with more judicious use of steroids, primarily restricted to concern for spinal cord edema with risk of secondary injury. We treated all children with IVIG given the relatively low risk of complications, the potential for modification of infection as in the mouse model, and theoretical benefit if there were an autoimmune component to the pathophysiology of AFM.13 Fluoxetine treatment was implemented in 2016 based on in vitro data that it inhibited the replication of EV D68, but there was no clear treatment effect in retrospective analysis so this agent has since been removed from our institutional treatment protocol.11, 18, 19 This highlights the observation that adding new therapies at the leading edge of knowledge is not always successful, and rational use must be constantly reassessed clinically to streamline treatment protocols.",

First, our sample size was small and limited to a single center's experience, so analyses are underpowered, and significant associations may be underestimated. Future studies of AFM will require multisite, standardized protocols to increase sample sizes and to detect subtle associations while accounting for possible confounders using multivariable regression models. Second, our study was retrospective. We examined motor outcomes using mRS because it could be applied retrospectively. However, the mRS is an insensitive measure for subtle motor changes and has not been validated in pediatric populations. Developing sensitive and specific outcome measures for AFM will be critical to understand fully the natural history of illness and to assess the efficacy of potential therapeutic options. Third, patients presented to our institution at variable times in their acute illness; we were not able to determine reliably the date of their initial symptom onset in this retrospective analysis. Therefore, the timing of etiologic testing was inconsistent, which may have introduced false-negative results. Timing to initiation of treatment was also variable, so if there is an optimal window for intervention, this may have been missed. Finally, steroids and plasma exchange were largely given to sicker patients. Therefore, a confounding by indication may obscure any potential treatment effects. Randomized controlled clinical trials would address these limitations, but are logistically difficult in a rare disease.",
