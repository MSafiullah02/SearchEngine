In April, 17 th , LSE researchers published an analysis of 7 official national data, including Australia, Singapore, Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland and Norway, and the reported share of care home residents whose deaths are linked to COVID-19 were from 14% to 64%. 2 Therefore, it is worth reporting that Taiwan has no cluster infection in the total of 62,651 beds at 1,091 care institutions. Only one single case (No. 156) was related to a nursing home RN among a total of 27,513 employees. 3, 4 WHO stressed the system and service coordination to provide long term care in its Interim Guidance on March 21 st , 2020. 5 Thus, we present an analysis based on the system theory, namely to discover the strengths on the macro, mezzo and micro levels of care institutions in Taiwan.",

The culture of institutional care in Taiwan endorses high diligence in IPC. Clear regulations, self-audits, and accreditation standards are set and strictly implemented. Hand washing is practiced before and after each clinical care. Universal vaccination for staff and residents alike is one of the top priority tasks prescribed by National Health Insurance, especially the flu shots in winter. Equally important is adequate stock of alcohol-based hand rub, medical masks, gloves and gowns. Staff training for IPC is done routinely. Residents' clothes and bedding are disinfected by direct sunshine and/or by ultraviolet rays. Windows need to be opened periodically for air circulation. Employees with any infectious diseases are restricted to work. Body temperature check is performed at least daily. Visitors must leave real names and phone numbers, and take routine IPC precautions.",

One is the formal organizational hierarchy from the Central Epidemic Command Center(CECC)to the local governments and then to the care institutions. The authority of the command channel is respected to avoid any misinformation, confusion or undue anxiety. The other layer of network is among the care institutions themselves via their associations and the local grouping mechanism. At the early onset of COVID-19, CECC has taken many actions. 6 The focal actions at that stage were border control, travel restrictions, case finding, resource allocation, communications and other administrative rules. Though not mentioned by CECC, the care institutions had recognized their need to respond immediately since their risks and stakes were both high. February 27 th , a red flag was raised when an illegal foreign care worker was tested positive at a hospital. Administrators responded quickly to suspend non-essential visits to hospitals for all residents. Shifts were re-arranged to ensure all units have designated care staff without any cross-over. Volunteers were discontinued. Family visitors were restricted. Social distancing is implemented among staff at dining and other office tasks. Migrant care workers were advised to spend their off days internally and avoid large congregation or activities. All such action plans were shared within the inter-organizational network. A strong comradeship helped turn the initial frantic inaction to organized actions among care institutions, and also helped implement the guidelines of CECC and local authorities.",

In particular, the inter-organizational partnership functions as a strong basis for emergency response to COVID-19. 7 However, as the condition is mitigated, more attention may be paid to some oversights with regards to care institutions. Foremost is the integrated health for care workers. They should be protected from excessive stress, overwork, burnout and fear of social stigma. We urge that the post emergency recovery agenda should include enhancement of the work-related rights, including wage, benefits, reimbursement, support and social recognition for the unsung heroes of care workers. Secondly, more investment should be made on telecare at care institutions to facilitate safety and quality of care. In addition, the utilization and frequency of hospital visits by residents of care institutions should be reviewed and reflected critically.",
