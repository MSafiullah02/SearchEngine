They include cholinesterase, which inactivates acetylcholine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to biologically active angiotensin II, and numerous other peptidases, transpeptidases, nucleotidases, phosphodiesterases, and phosphatases. Many CD antigens of leukocytes are ecto-enzymes; some CD antigens for which no function is currently known are probably ectoenzymes. Expression is highly regulated and correlated with differentiation and activation. Some are highly restricted in distribution; others are ubiquitous. Many are shared between leukocytes and non-hematogenous cells. Biological functions appear to depend on the type and location of the cell in which expression occurs, and include recycling of nutrients, local control of response to cytokines and hormones, bone formation, cell mobility, invasion, and metastasis. Many novel regulatory functions of ecto-enzymes remain to be discovered, and may reveal new mechanisms of local extracellular control of cellular function. J. Leukoc. Biol. 67: 285-311; 2000.",

Cortisol and aldosterone bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor with similar affinity, but cortisol is selectively destroyed by 11-HSD in mineralocorticoid-responsive cells. In other words, selective response to mineralocorticoids is not mediated by an appropriately specific receptor, but rather by the presence of a local enzyme that inactivates a competing molecule [10] [11] [12] .",

In the case of the ecto-ATPase CD39, there are two transmembrane domains, one at the amino-terminal region and one at the carboxy-terminal region, and the extracellular catalytic loop lies between them (Fig. 1 ).

Older names persist for good reasons, such as the need to provide a link to previous literature. Abandonment of older names might There are many variations on these themes. Many ecto-enzymes are homodimers, although this is not shown. CD26 and CD38 are typical class II membrane proteins, with a membrane/signal sequence near the amino terminus, which is in the cytoplasm. The prototypic structure of CD39 is shown, with transmembrane regions at the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus, which resembles the topography of P2X receptors (see Fig. 3 ). Variants of CD39 are known that have only amino-terminal or only carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains, or even no transmembrane regions at all. The three-dimensional structure of RT6 is known. It contains a conserved ''Pacman fold'' in the NAD \u03e9 -binding domain, where two abutting \u2424-sheets form the upper and lower ''jaws'' of the active site cleft. RT6 and CD73 (as well as alkaline phosphatase) are attached to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attached to the carboxy terminus. In some cases, water-soluble forms are also present. Most of these appear to arise by cleavage of the membrane anchor by proteases or phospholipases. result in searches of the literature failing to identify key papers, and the thread of discovery could be lost. The trivial name that was first assigned to an enzyme is usually easier to remember than the current ''random walk through the alphabet.' ' The older names are often frankly misleading. Assignment of a name to a family of enzymes does not imply that it has the monopoly on a particular activity. One major group (the CD39 family) is generally known as the ''ecto-ATPase'' family, but many other enzymes also degrade ATP, including the ectopyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family [25] . The plasma cell membrane antigen PC-1 is by no means specific for plasma cells. For clarity, I have continued to use some older names for enzymes in this review, but I have cross-referenced them extensively.",

Designation as 5\u0408-nucleotide phosphodiesterases or phosphodiesterases-1 appears no longer advisable because the terms were initially coined to differentiate these enzymes from 3'-exo(deoxy)ribonucleases (EC 3.1.16). They should not be classified as exonucleases because, unlike canonical exonucleases, they act much better on oligonucleotides than on polynucleotides. The name NPP (i.e., nucleotide phosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase) was preferred because it indicates the specificity for nucleotides and not for lipid phosphodiesterases.",

The membrane enzyme that hydrolyzes diadenosine polyphosphates in the bovine adrenal medulla appears to be a member of the PC-1 family, possibly PC-1 itself [84] . Harahap et al. found no evidence for expression of PC-1 in the adrenal in mice [24] , but this point should be re-examined to see whether it reflects species differences or whether a different family member is present in the mouse.",

Cloning of autotaxin cDNA was achieved in 1994 and, surprisingly, revealed high homology with phosphodiesterases and PC-1 [44] . In the same year, cDNA encoding an ecto-phosphodiesterase was cloned from rat brain and named PD-1\u2423 [45] . It soon became apparent that these cDNAs were splice variants of the same gene. Several other splice variants have now been cloned from rat brain [85] . Autotaxin cloned from human teratocarcinoma cells was found to be almost identical to autotaxin cDNA from melanoma cells [68] , but lacked a 52-amino-acid insertion that was present in the latter. PD-1\u2423 also lacks the 52-amino-acid insertion that was present in the human melanoma cells, but contains a second insertion of 25 amino acids that is lacking in both the human autotaxins.",

This last property is particularly important because the biological activity of autotaxin requires its phosphodiesterase activity [86] . There is strong evidence that its mobility-inducing activity is mediated via the binding of adenosine to P1 adenosine receptors [87] because motility is stimulated by adenosine agonists and is blocked by adenosine antagonists. Moreover, responsiveness can be transferred into Chinese hamster ovary cells by transfection with cDNA encoding the adenosine A1 receptor.

In spite of the differences in length of the cytoplasmic tails, there are ''islands'' of very strong conservation, presumably reflecting functional constraints. One such constraint is likely to be the presence of targeting signals that direct the protein to the appropriate cell surface.

For each family member, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are highly conserved between species, indicating functional constraints on genetic drift. In contrast, the sequences of the cytoplasmic tails and transmembrane regions differ greatly between family members, most probably reflecting differences in signals that direct intracellular location to apical or basolateral membranes. The sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of mouse PC-1 has been corrected for three errors in the previously published sequence. Optimal alignment of the cytoplasmic tails of mouse and human PC-1 require several gaps, revealing ''islands'' of conserved sequence. It is likely that these conserved islands contain important signals for intracellular trafficking. units [21, 22] .

In 1996, Wang and Guidotti discovered that CD39 has sequence homology with a potato apyrase, and that CD39 has apyrase activity [100] . This work led to the identification of a family of ecto-ATPases that are related in sequence, but vary in their membrane topology and tissue distribution [20, 97] . The first member of this group, CD39, was found to hydrolyze either ATP or ADP, and was called ''ecto-ATP diphosphohydrolase.'' Further work has shown that some members of this family have a strong preference for ATP, whereas others also efficiently hydrolyze ADP. These activities found in soluble enzymes have been generally known as apyrases, but the convergence of ecto-ATPases and apyrases has now rendered these terms more or less interchangeable.",

The effect was highly synergistic with lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-4 (IL-4). CD38 has only a short cytoplasmic tail (23 amino acids) and no obvious signaling motifs, and the mechanism of these effects has been difficult to determine. However, there is ample precedent for ecto-enzymes having signal transduction capacity, because this has been demonstrated for CD26, CD73, and RT-6 (see below).",

However, in retrospect the discovery of ARC activity was probably misleading. The active site of the enzyme is outside the cell, whereas the only known location of these products is intracellular. (The precedent of extracellular ATP meant that this objection did not have to be taken very seriously.) Production of cADPR does not seem to be necessary for signaling. More recent work has shown that CD38 should be regarded as a ''classical'' NAD \u03e9 glycohydrolase [107] , and may indeed be the only NAD \u03e9 glycohydrolase in mammals, but it may have little or nothing to do with cyclic ADP-ribose.",

The acceptor is usually a protein, and the most commonly modified amino acid is arginine, although histidine and cysteine may also be modified. The reaction was discovered about 30 years ago as the pathogenic mechanism of action of diphtheria toxin, which was found to modify elongation factor 2 at a histidine residue, resulting in the cessation of protein synthesis. Several other bacterial toxins are also ADP-ribosyltransferases. Cholera and pertussis toxins exert their effects by ADP-ribosylating the \u2423 subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins at arginine and cysteine, respectively. Most bacterial ADP-ribosyl transferases are encoded by mobile genetic elements such as phages, plasmids, and pathogenicity islands, and horizontal transfer between species seems likely [115] . The NAD \u03e9 -binding domain is made up of two abutting \u2424-sheets that form the ''jaws'' of the active site cleft, and this motif has been termed the ''Pacman fold'' (Fig. 1) .",

Unlike the situation for extracellular ATP, at the present time there is little evidence for active secretion of NAD \u03e9 . NAD \u03e9 could come from dead or dying cells, which are common physiological events in the immune system and also in a variety of pathological situations. NAD \u03e9 can be destroyed by CD38 and PC-1, but not by the ''classical ecto-ATPases'' such as the CD39 family. Destruction of extracellular NAD \u03e9 may be an important mechanism for control of ecto-ADP ribosyltransferases by limiting the availability of substrate.",

Sequencing of Rt-6-1 cDNA revealed a premature stop codon in C57BL/6 mice, whereas Rt6-2 was normal in both strains. Hence, it would appear that C57BL/6 is a naturally occurring knockout for Rt6-1.

Resta and Thompson have recently suggested that the T cell deficiency in ADA deficiency may result from adenosine toxicity in the thymic cortex [131, 132] . ADA degrades adenosine to inosine; adenosine would be expected to build up in ADA deficiency, and a plausible pathway for toxic effects of adenosine on T cells is known. Adenosine can act on A1 receptors to induce apoptosis via a cyclic AMP-mediated pathway, resulting in a block of T cell maturation at the double-negative stage, with failure to rearrange the \u2423 chain of the T cell receptor. Somewhat surprisingly, this block does not seem to affect the numbers of \u2425\u2426 T cells.",

P2X 7 receptors respond to agonist binding by the opening within milliseconds of a channel for small cations, and then within seconds by the opening of a much larger pore that allows penetration of molecules up to about 900 Da, including propidium dyes. P2X 7 receptors mediate apoptosis and intracellular killing, and seem to play an important role in inflammation, phagocytosis, and tissue repair. They induce apoptosis in macrophages, and in so doing, cause the macrophages to kill intracellular mycobacteria [166] . This effect cannot be mediated by cytokines alone, and seems to require the presence of extracellular ATP. It appears to be mediated by mechanisms that are distinct from reactive nitrogen or oxygen intermediates, and may provide important new insights into defense mechanisms against tuberculosis. There is some evidence that CD8 \u03e9 cytotoxic T cells can secrete ATP, which may provoke the killing of intracellular organisms [167] .

They are now extremely well characterized at the molecular level, and constitute a very large and diverse family [195, 196] . If it could be proven that similar control mechanisms exist outside cells, it would be a most exciting and important advance. There have been numerous reports of ecto-protein kinases, but these have been somewhat controversial [197] . Difficulties include contamination with cytoplasmic kinases, metabolic interconversions involving phosphate, cell viability, and leakage across damaged membranes. There has also been skepticism concerning whether ATP is really secreted by cells. The intracellular ATP concentration is typically about 5 mM, and leakage from damaged or dead cells would be enough to cause significant artifacts. However, numerous physiological mechanisms for release of ATP from cells have now been documented (see below). Redegeld et al. [197] have summarized the criteria for detection of ecto-protein kinase activity. Highly viable cells must be used, and the extracellular substrates must not penetrate the cell membrane. Low concentrations of ATP should be used, and incubation times kept short. Addition of millimolar concentrations of inorganic phosphate should not affect phosphorylation, and experiments should be carried out in serum-free medium, because serum may contain protein kinases. The sites of addition of phosphate to proteins must be shown to be located on their extracellular domains. It has also been suggested that the phosphorylated region should be able to be released from the cell by proteolysis, but this requirement may be difficult to meet because many membrane proteins are quite resistant to proteolytic removal from cells.",

Two activities, named ecto-PK I and ecto-PK II were identified. Ecto-PK I consisted of a single 40-kDa moiety, whereas ecto-PK II had catalytic subunits of 43 and 40 kDa and a third noncatalytic subunit of 28 kDa. The molecular nature of ecto-PK1 was not identified, but ecto-PK II cross-reacted with antibodies to the well-known protein intracellular kinase CK II. Peptide mapping and mass spectrometry suggested that ''ecto-PK II'' was similar to, or identical with CK II. The question of whether this activity was truly an ''ecto-kinase'' or merely contamination by cytoplasmic CK II was not definitively resolved.",

They also showed that the corresponding threonine residue on bovine intestinal phosphodiesterase could not be autophosphorylated, demonstrating that autophosphorylation is not an intrinsic property of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase reaction. PC-1 appeared to be capable of phosphorylating histone IIa, although this protein is an extremely poor substrate, with a K m of \u03fe100 \u00b5M [52] .
