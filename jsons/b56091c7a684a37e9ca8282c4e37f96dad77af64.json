            "text": "In 1912 in Munich, Germany, Paul Ewald, together with two students, W. Friedrich and P. Knipping, demonstrated that a crystal of Cu 2 SO 4 could diffract X-rays, consistent with von Laue's predictions (Ewald, 1962) . The experiment was performed at night to avoid the wrath of the senior professors who were of the opinion that the experiment was worthless. Yet, this small episode changed science and the world. Less than 50 years later, the same technology had been used to determine the first atomic structures of two proteins (Kendrew et al., 1958; Kendrew et al., 1960; Perutz et al., 1960; Hadfield et al., 1995) , and by the time another 25 years had gone by the structure of two human viruses had been determined (Hogle et al., 1985; Rossmann et al., 1985) . Even more recently, the structure and mechanism of the protein synthesizing ribosomal machine (http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/) were established. From its beginning, X-ray crystallography was a method that was capable of resolving individual atoms, but its power to view large, complex biological molecules grew only gradually. By the end of the twentieth century, pharmaceutical companies were eagerly employing crystallographers in the hopes that structural information would lead to cures for numerous human diseases. Yet, just like a financial bubble, the good times are now coming to an end, as the proteins whose structures have not yet been determined are ever more difficult to crystallize. The projects have grown more ambitious, aiming at membrane proteins and large protein complexes. Fortunately, EM has now advanced to a point where it is rapidly replacing crystallography as the major pioneering tool of structural biology (Harrison, 2010) .",

            "text": "The 1912 experiment showed that X-rays were waves, that the repeating units in crystals were of roughly the same dimensions as the wavelength of X-rays, and confirmed the chemical ideas of the atomicity of matter. This news spread rapidly to England where Lawrence Bragg interpreted the mathematical expressions of von Laue to an easier to comprehend physical concept. He went on to use his physical insight to show that the pattern of intensities caused by the diffraction of X-rays from crystals of NaCl and KCl were consistent with spherical metal ions filling the spaces between the larger spherical, cubic close packed, Cl \u00c0 ions (Bragg, 1913) . Chemists of the time found this difficult to comprehend as they thought that NaCl was a compound consisting of individual NaCl molecules. When eventually the heated discussion was settled in favor of the cubic arrangement of ions, this discovery turned out to be the birth of structural chemistry. After the end of the First World War in 1918, there reemerged an interest in structural crystallography, led by Sir Lawrence Bragg. Initially, this was directed to the investigation of centric structures, mainly minerals, many of which had interesting symmetries, but gradually crystallographers turned to organic compounds. For instance, Kathleen Lonsdale (later to be elected the first female Fellow of the Royal Society) was able to confirm that hexamethylbenzene was a flat molecule (Lonsdale, 1928) . Notwithstanding the difficulties of the Second World War, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin had been able to establish the structure of the asymmetric penicillin molecule, the first antibiotic used with much success during the Second World War (Crowfoot, 1948) .",

            "text": "By this time, crystallographers had gone beyond the ''trial and error'' approach of guessing at atomic positions and were starting to use a variety of computational tools including the Patterson function (Patterson, 1934 (Patterson, , 1935 and the heavy atom technique. In addition, crystallographers had discovered the use of Fourier syntheses to represent electron density as presented on stacked sheets of glass plates (Bragg, 1929) . These new techniques required lengthy calculations, helped by such tools as Beevers Lipson ''strips'' (Beevers and Lipson, 1936) for the manual summation of a Fourier series. Fortunately, the first home-built, and then commercial, electronic computers became available in the 1950s. Many of the early crystallographic structures had been determined with only one-or twodimensional data, but with the advent of better computational devices there was a desire to extend data collection into three dimensions. This set the stage, as mentioned above, for the structural determinations of biological macromolecules and molecular assemblies in the second half of the twentieth century. The structure determinations of large molecules also required large machines, such as robots, for producing crystals, synchrotrons to produce intense, coherent, almost monochromatic X-rays, and fast computer graphics piggy-backed on the development of gaming machines. The most recent emphasis has been on ever-smaller crystals, as the difficulty of growing crystals has increased in proportion to the size of the object being crystallized. In some experiments, the crystals are only a few unit cells in each direction, while others have been even more audacious by looking at the diffraction pattern of single molecules (Bogan et al., 2008) with the help of extremely intense X-ray lasers (Kirian et al., 2010) . Indeed, the increasing demands on instrumentation are pushing X-ray imaging techniques to the limits of what is achievable (Rossmann and Arnold, 2001) . There are, however, alternative simpler and less expensive ways for obtaining structural results at the boundaries of structural biology.",

The relative phase of the diffracted rays is the central ''phase problem'' of any X-ray structure determination. The phases need to be determined indirectly in order to be able to calculate the electron density distribution in the crystal. In contrast, an electron microscope uses the wave properties of the electrons to form an image of the object in the same way as does a light microscope. Unlike X-rays, scattered electrons can be focused with magnetic lenses, allowing an image to be formed and thereby solving the phase problem directly. The average wavelength of fast electrons is around 0.02 \u00c5 , of X-rays roughly 1 \u00c5 , compared to 3900-7500 \u00c5 for visible light. Thus, unlike visible light, electrons and X-rays can be used to resolve individual atoms (covalently bonded atoms are separated by about 1.5 \u00c5 ). Nevertheless, the development of atomic-resolution EM has lagged behind the development of X-ray crystallography.",

Development accelerated after the end of the Second World War with the introduction of negative stains using heavy metal dyes to enhance contrast between water and the almost equally dense biological samples. Unfortunately, the staining process also caused distortions and artifacts in the samples.",

            "text": "De Rosier and Klug (1968) suggested combining different projections of isolated molecular particles in order to create a three-dimensional image. This led to the three-dimensional structure determinations of small plant viruses using negatively stained samples (Crowther and Amos, 1972 ). An important breakthrough came in 1988 with the use of flash freezing techniques for embedding the specimen in vitreous (amorphous) ice (Dubochet et al., 1988) . This technique preserved the specimen in a near-native state, free of the artifacts of staining. Immediately, there was a flurry of new reconstructions, particularly of viruses but also of ribosomes, chaperones, and other molecular assemblies. Large complexes that could not be crystallized, such as viruses interacting with cellular receptors or viruses interacting with antibodies (Smith et al., 1993; Wikoff et al., 1994) , could now be studied by combining cryo-EM of the complex with crystallography of the individual component molecules (Rossmann, 2000; Rossmann et al., 2001) to generate ''pseudo-atomic'' models. Cryo-EM was used to obtain the lower resolution ''large picture'' into which the higher resolution crystal structures of the components were fitted (Rossmann, 2000; Rossmann et al., 2001) , enabling analysis of interactions between the component structures. Another use of cryo-EM structures can be to provide a low-resolution model for molecular replacement to initiate X-ray crystal structure determinations by means of phase extension, as was the case for a ribosomal subunit (Ban et al., 1998) or phiX174 virus particle (Dokland et al., 1998) . In contrast to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM was initially used primarily to study complex homogeneous objects at rather limited resolution.",

In the past 2 or 3 years, cryo-EM has been able to produce, in favorable cases, three-dimensional images that are comparable to X-ray crystal structures of icosahedral viruses ( Jiang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010) . That has been an important development as it has become apparent that larger viruses with lipid envelopes cannot usually be crystallized or give only very poorly diffracting crystals (Harrison et al., 1992; Bamford et al., 2002; Kaufmann et al., 2010) . But, like crystallography, this form of cryo-EM is also reaching its limits because large biological objects tend to be heterogeneous. For this reason, cryo-ET is becoming a more frequently used tool Lu\u010di\u0107 et al., 2005) . In this technique, a three-dimensional image is created by combining many images taken of the same sample oriented by a succession of tilt angles about a common axis (or multiple axes). Because the same sample is repeatedly exposed to the electron beam, the electron dose per image has to be kept very low to avoid radiation damage, lowering the feasible resolution. Currently, numerous schemes are being developed to mitigate the effects of the low dose, the physical limitations of the tilting equipment, and the increased specimen thickness with increased tilt angle. These techniques are making inroads not only for the study of large heterogeneous molecular assemblies but also for bacteria and eukaryotic cells (Lu\u010di\u0107 et al., 2005) .",

Under these conditions, the contrast transfer function is maximal at low resolution and the first node of the contrast transfer function occurs at a much higher resolution.

            "text": "Recently, there have been some notable successes in determining structures of icosahedral viruses to a resolution that is high enough to enable model building based solely on the cryo-EM map, the amino acid sequence, and geometric constraints (Yu et al., 2008; Harrison, 2010; Liu et al., 2010a Liu et al., , 2010b Zhang et al., 2010) . Obtaining near-atomic-resolution results for less symmetric or asymmetric objects will require a proportionate amount of additional projection images, making experimental data collection daunting. Zhang et al. (2010) used approximately 2 \u00c2 10 4 virus particles to determine the structure of aquareovirus to 3.3 \u00c5 resolution using both icosahedral averaging and 10-fold averaging among quasiequivalent subunits within the icosahedral asymmetric unit. An additional advantage of built-in icosahedral symmetry is that the relative orientations of 60 symmetrically related orientations are known exactly for each particle, whereas the relative orientations of asymmetric particles are subject to experimental error. Thus, obtaining a reconstruction with comparable resolution for an asymmetric object of similar size would require at least 1.2 \u00c2 10 7 particle images. Another obstacle to high-resolution structure determination is sample heterogeneity due to varying conformations of molecular assemblies. Although this can be tackled by the careful selection of images that correspond to closely related structures (Scheres et al., 2007) , the need for additional data increases proportionately. Improving the resolution in these difficult cases will require efficient data acquisition techniques. The development of the LEGINON software for automated data collection marks a significant achievement in this area (Suloway et al., 2005) . The use of charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors instead of films further expedites the data collection process (Clare and Orlova, 2010) . Currently, in development are ''direct detectors'' that produce images with an improved signal-to-noise ratio by avoiding the conversion of electrons into photons required for CCD detectors (Milazzo et al., 2010) .",

Because macromolecular complexes can be difficult to crystallize, it is sometimes easier to determine the structure of the individual components of the complex. However, structures of individual proteins may not be sufficient for functional interpretation of molecular interactions in the absence of knowledge of their spatial relationships. Further, the structural details of component proteins within functionally relevant complexes are likely to differ in detail from individually determined structures. Cryo-EM maps of such complexes, though not yet typically determined to atomic resolution, can be interpreted at near-atomic resolution using ''pseudo-atomic'' models. In current practice, these models are constructed by rigid-body fitting of component structures, previously determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR (Cheng et al., 1995) , into cryo-EM maps. The models are either treated as a single rigid body or split into a few domains that are each fitted separately (Zhang et al., 2004; Hafenstein et al., 2007; Cherrier et al., 2009 ). This approach is based on the observation that conformational changes of proteins are usually limited to the relative positioning of domains whose tertiary structure remains much the same.",

However, as the resolution of the cryo-EM map improves, it may be possible to refine the orientation and position of individual structural elements such as a-helices and b-sheets. Finally, as the resolution improves beyond 4 \u00c5 , it becomes possible to refine Ramachandran and rotary dihedral angles, as is usually the case for a crystallographic refinement. Care must be taken that the number of parameters describing the structure is appropriate to the number of experimental measurements. For instance, the molecular structure of a eukaryotic ribosome (Taylor et al., 2009) was determined by combining a 7-\u00c5 cryo-EM reconstruction with molecular dynamics. The results are impressive given the complexity of the structure. Nevertheless, such a structural determination requires validation, as the number of parameters describing the structure might be larger than the number of independent observations.",

Thus, there should be indicators describing the quality of the collected images (similar to crystallographic R merge ; Rossmann et al., 1979) , the accuracy of the contrast transfer function (CTF) determination for each image, and the accuracy of the particle orientation determination. Further statistics should describe the resulting map-What is its resolution (I/s(I) as a function of resolution)? How well does the map correspond to original experimental images (Baker et al., 1999) ? Perhaps some of the experimental images could be excluded from the calculation of the reconstruction and used as a test set for an unbiased validation of the final map (R map free ) (Br\u00fcnger, 1992) . The fitting of atomic structures into cryo-EM maps for the purpose of evaluating pseudo-atomic models can be accomplished by the equivalent of a six-dimensional search. Whether an unambiguous solution can be found will depend on whether the best fit is significantly better than all other fits. However, if this is not the case, additional chemical and physical criteria can be used to identify the best fit (Rossmann et al., 2001) . Once a reasonable fit has been obtained, the number of refinable parameters that describe the atomic model needs to be chosen according to the resolution FUTURE PROSPECTS of the map. A parameter analogous to the crystallographic R model free would be a suitable measure to validate that the number of parameters does not exceed what is useful (Br\u00fc nger, 1992) .",

Initially, the X-ray structure deposition was not an obligatory prerequisite for publication of the results and only over time did it become a general requirement enforced by journal policies. It was only in 2008 that experimental data deposition became an obligatory component of atomic coordinate deposition to the PDB. The first model based on cryo-EM reconstruction was deposited with the PDB in 1997. Since then, the number of deposited models has grown exponentially and will be expected to be around 320 by the end of 2010 (Fig. 1 ).
