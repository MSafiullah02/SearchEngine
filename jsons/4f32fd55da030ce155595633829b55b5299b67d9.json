The first is the surprising fact that coronaviruses are present in the highly acidic gastric epithelium-the spike virus titer, regardless of the temperature (from 4 to 37 \u00b0C) [2] . In other words, in order for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to invade epithelial cells without being inactivated in the stomach, the gastric pH must be neutral.",

In the report from China, blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-O blood groups [6] . According to more than 2,000 case-control studies in Japan, blood group A is susceptible to HP infection and AG [7] . Similarly, in Chinese case-control studies, the proportion of HP infection in blood-group A individuals was significantly higher than that of non-A blood groups [8] . These facts indicate that for individuals with blood group A, the route of viral transmission is likely to include the risk of gastrointestinal infections, in addition to those of the respiratory tract. There are also concerns that users of drugs such as proton pump inhibitors or potassium-competitive acid blockers for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease-regardless of whether they have blood type A, chronic gastritis, or HP infection-may be similarly at risk.",

The average age of the virus-positive population in stool samples was 49 years,suggesting that aging is involved in the ease of virus invasion. Age-related increases in gastric pH can be explained by atrophic gastritis (AG) and gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) due to Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. In China and many other countries, the likelihood of having AG and IM increases with age[3].",
