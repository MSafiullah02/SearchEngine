Like other flavonoids, flavonols are most apparent antioxidant in higher plants. Antioxidative activity of flavonols has been shown experimentally to prevent nuclear DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide in plants (Melidou et al. 2005). Studies on Arabidopsis plant have shown that flavonols are involved in providing protection to plant leaves against oxidative damage due to excessive visible radiation (Havaux and Kloppstech 2001). They are also involved in providing defense against fungal infection to plant leaves (Treutter 2006).",

To avoid the harms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, scientists now look toward natural products with higher efficacy and fewer side effects. In this regard, the anticancer activity of gossypin has been investigated by many researchers. A study by Babu et al. (2003) demonstrated the anticarcinogenic activity of the bioflavonoid gossypin against the carcinogens such as DMBA which causes skin papillomas in mouse. Moreover it was shown to decrease the tumor burden in solid tumors and inhibition of angiogenesis. The antitumor activity of gossypin is attributed somewhat to its ability to inhibit the key enzymes in DNA replication, the topoisomerase I and II (Babu et al. 2003). In another study conducted on human glioma, U251 cells treated with gossypin showed promising results. Gossypin caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase involving the phosphorylation of cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C) tyrosine phosphatase through the stimulation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) (Shi et al. 2012). Additionally gossypin has been found to block cell multiplication in L929, HT29, and K562 tumor cell lines in vitro (Babu et al. 2003). Another possible mechanism underlying anti-tumorigenic capability of gossypin was demonstrated by Kunnumakkara et al. (2007). They analyzed the effect of gossypin on NF-kappa B, a master regulator involved in inflammation, carcinogenesis, hyper-proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. The results supported the hypothesis of possible NF-kappa B inhibition by gossypin (Kunnumakkara et al. 2007).",

(2011) in a study of skin cancer. In this study isorhamnetin blocked epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced neoplastic cell transformation by suppressing the expression of COX-2 protein. COX-2 is a major inflammatory mediator and exerts pro-tumorigenic activity (M\u00e9ric et al. 2006). Furthermore it exerted a negative effect on anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of A431 human epithelial carcinoma cell line (Kim et al. 2011). Many other evidences support isorhamnetin\u2019s role in reducing cell growth and weight and size of tumors (Ma et al. 2007a; Steffen et al. 2008). Another set of experiments revealed antitumor role of isorhamnetin by inhibition of the cell cycle protein, farnesyl protein transferase (FPTase) (Oh et al. 2005). Previously, quercetin was shown to be a potent anticancer agent, but newer studies have signified the increased potential of isorhamnetin an effective anticancer entity. Such isorhamnetin showed elevated levels of cytotoxicity against cancerous cells as compared to quercetin. It induces necrosis and apoptosis in human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116) (Jaramillo et al. 2010). Moreover in another research aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-mediated oxidative stress was lessened considerably by isorhamnetin more than quercetin in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Choi et al. 2010).",

These glycosides are kaempferitrin (kaempferol 3,7-dirhamnoside) (Vishnu Prasad et al. 2009), astragalin (Wei et al. 2011), afzelin (kaempferol 3-rhamnoside) (Markham et al. 1992), kaempferol 7-O-glucoside (Ibrahim et al. 2008), robinin (kaempferol-3-O-robinoside-7-O-rhamnoside) (March et al. 2004), sophoraflavonoloside (kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside) (Kim et al. 2012), and trifolin (kaempferol-3-O-galactoside) (Nowak and Wolbis 2002). Kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside-7-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside is one of the most bitter-tasting glycoside compounds and has been isolated from the methanolic plants (Gohar et al. 2000; Ragasa et al. 2005). During the metabolism process by the activity of enzyme transferase, these flavonoid kaempferol compounds can transfer the product of kaempferol and S-adenosyl methionine to kaempferide (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011; Curir et al. 2001). Kaempferide is defined as 4\u2032-O-methylkaempferol which is also included in chemical flavonoid compound (Curir et al. 2001). These isolated flavonoid and chemical compounds have an antimicrobial (Yang et al. 2010), antioxidant (Choi et al. 2013), anticancer (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011), neuroprotective (Filomeni et al. 2012), antidiabetic (Habtemariam 2011), immunomodulatory (Kim et al. 2008), anti-osteoporotic, antiestrogenic (Oh et al. 2006), anxiolytic (Vissiennon et al. 2012), analgesic (Tsiklauri et al. 2011), and anti-allergic activities (Kim et al. 2008). Therefore naturally occurring plants are usually used as medicinal plants and for pharmaceutical products. The study of immunopharmacological properties of these plants has clearly shown the result to inhibit the cell growth, oxidative low-density lipoprotein (LDLP) suppression, viral inhibition, and reduction of apoptosis and strengthen the immune system (Kim et al. 2008). Kaempferol and kaempferide are developed by the metabolic activities of bioactive plants and are agents to treat many disorders (Kim et al. 2008). Ginkgo biloba, Moringa oleifera, Equisetum spp., Tilia spp., propolis, and Sophora japonica are the species of medicinal productivity (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011). For the cure of free radical damages and different infectious diseases, these pharmacokinetics species have often been utilized (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011). It was indicated that kaempferol compound in plants can be used as an agent of chemo-protection (Chen and Chen 2013). Recently it was observed that hypertension stress that associated with cardiac risks has been suppressed by the consumption of this anticancer compound in tea and broccoli(Calderon-Montano et al. 2011). It has been concluded that kaempferol also plays a vital role to overcome the inflammatory response (Choi et al. 2013). Kaempferol also suppresses the translational activity of particular protein that may help to inhibit the growth of inflammatory lesions (Choi et al. 2013). Kaempferol has been isolated from B. pinnatum which is a medicinal herb used as drug for the antimicrobial activity (Tatsimo et al. 2012). It also inhibits the aggregation of the foam-producing cells, and these foam-producing cells increase the low-density lipoprotein oxidation (Li et al. 2013). These naturally occurring compounds are also used to eliminate cholesterol and lipids from macrophages (Li et al. 2013). Therefore it can reduce the effect of atherosclerotic disorder (Li et al. 2013) and toxicity of neurodegenerative Parkinson\u2019s disease (Filomeni et al. 2012). Secondary glycosidic metabolites of kaempferoid have the ability to develop products like kaempferol as anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-glycine (Al-Musayeib et al. 2011). While these metabolites not only target the tumorous cells but are also capable of minimizing the side effects of the combination of both radio- and chemotherapies (Al-Musayeib et al. 2011). Productivity of kaempferol and phytochemically active compound kaempferide has a key importance to act as antiestrogenic property (Hung 2004). Photochemicals inhibit the estrogen and progesterone receptors to control the proliferation of inflammatory cancerous cells (Frigo et al. 2002). Kaempferide has structural capability to suppress the attack of fungal infections (Curir et al. 2001). It was hypothesized that kaempferol reduces the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors too. VEGF receptor increases the risk of ovarian cancer; it can be controlled by taking dietary fruits and vegetables having flavonoid products (Luo et al. 2010). In vivo investigations induced the role of flavonoid kaempferide acting as an antioxidant to treat the liver patients by the use of isoforms such as P450 (Otake and Walle 2002). Another side in vitro studies show that kaempferide has anti-plasmodium and antimalarial activity against the strains of Plasmodium falciparum (De Monbrison et al. 2006). Therefore in this study it was analyzed that naturally occurring flavonol and chemically active compounds can be used as therapeutic agents. These therapeutic products play an important role to save human life and suppress the activity of various infectious diseases with the help of development of these compounds.",

            "text": "Rhamnazin was synthesized through the activity of enzyme 3-methylquercetin 7-O-methyltransferase (Khouri et al. 1988; Ozipek et al. 1994). This transferase enzyme uses S-adenosyl methionine and isorhamnetin to produce S-adenosylhomocysteine and rhamnazin (Khouri et al. 1988). Basically rhamnazin is known as 3,5-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-methoxychromen-4-one (Khouri et al. 1988). It is also the naturally occurring 3\u2032,7-dimethylquercetin flavonoid compound (Joe et al. 2010). Like other naturally occurring chemical compounds, rhamnetin and rhamnazin also have anticancerous (Lee et al. 2011; Ma et al. 2012), antioxidant (Pande 2001), and anti-infectious activities (Ahmed et al. 2001), etc. The O-methylated flavonoid compounds are chemically methylated on hydroxyl groups. Chemical formation of this methoxy bond is difficult because methoxylation is possible in any position of molecule (Lee et al. 2011). So the usage of specific enzyme O-methyltransferase plays an important role which interacts substrate on specific position of molecule (Mattarei et al. 2010). That enzyme implies the O-methylation on a specific hydroxyl (3-OH) position. Multile hydroxal functional groups greatly contribute towards the therapeutic potential of polyphenols (Mattarei et al. 2010). In the metabolism these substrate molecules are rapidly being converted into sulfates, glucuronides, and methyl ethers (Biasutto et al. 2007; Mattarei et al. 2010). The effect of O-methylation depends on the solubility of flavonoids (Mattarei et al. 2010). In vivo experiments induced that chemical modification of these molecules were to enhance the solubility effect while reduces the metabolic effects to provide the low bioavailability of polyphenols (Biasutto et al. 2007; Manach et al. 2005; Silberberg et al. 2006; Williamson and Manach 2005). These studies observed the overall survival of polyphenol OHs (Mattarei et al. 2010). As shown in Fig. 1, structurally rhamnetin is a monoethyl ether of quercetin while rhamnazin is identified as quercetin dimethyl ether (Martini et al. 2004). Therapeutic potential could be attributed to functional groups i.e. C-ring of 3\u2032-hydroxyl and 4\u2032-hydroxyl groups contribute towards redox activity (Metodiewa et al. 1999), while 3-OH act as inhibitor (Sarno et al. 2002). On the other hand, 7-OH and 5-OH are having weak and less acidic activity because of intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the 4-carbon of carbonyl compound (Van Dijk et al. 2000). This study reports that acetylated 3-OH bond has enzymatic activity and is used as protective chemical reaction of catecholic OHs (Mattarei et al. 2010). They also suggest that this mitochondrial-targeted compound has a free OH at the specific 3-position (Mattarei et al. 2010).",

Myricetin has been found to protect neurons\u2019 discrete and multiple pathways and inhibited glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Shimmyo et al. 2008). Myricetin was exerted as potent chemopreventive activity mainly by targeting activity of Fyn kinase straightly and afterward attenuated UVB-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression (skin carcinogenesis) (Jung et al. 2008). Myricetin (20 \u03bcM) when treated with macrophages derived from U937 has been significantly observed to inhibit the expression of mRNA and surface protein CD36 cells, which means myricetin might play an important role in ameliorating atherosclerosis (Lian et al. 2008). During the experimental result of Perls\u2019 iron staining, it has made an evidence in the substantial nigra by the enhancement of iron-staining cells; myricetin prevented the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (Ma et al. 2007b). It has also been observed that antiproliferative potential of flavonoids decreased in the order isorhamnetin > kaempferol > myricetin > rutin, while their antioxidant properties decreased in the order rutin > myricetin > kaempferol > isorhamnetin. When combined the treatment of isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and myricetin with AraC has led to synergism in their antiproliferative activities (Nadova et al. 2007).",

Such studies involved molecular docking, three-dimensional structure-activity relationship, and pharmacophore modeling. Investigations have reported the interactions and pharmacophoric models for flavonols based on their interactions with cellular proteins. Using theoretical and computational approaches and the antioxidant activity of structure-activity relationship of flavonoids has been calculated (Butkovic et al. 2004; Ghiotto et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2009; Om and Kim 2008; Teixeira et al. 2005). A pharmacophore map based on flavonols suggested anti-angiogenic and thus antitumor drug leads as human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (hVEGFR2) antagonists (Yang et al. 2008). Therapeutic potential of flavonoids has been explained for genetic/metabolic disorders (i.e. xanthinuria, gout, and diabetes mellitus by inhibition of respective enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldose reductase, and liposygenase), but also for viral infections as well using computational approaches (Alves et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2012).",
