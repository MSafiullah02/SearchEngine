HTLV- I is endemic in southwestern Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean Basin, and South America [3, 4]. In Japan, more than one million people were estimated to be infected with HTLV-I and more than 1000 develop ATL every year [4\u20136]. For the first-line treatment of aggressive ATL (acute-type and lymphoma-type), which accounts for 80% of ATL, combination chemotherapies such as mLSG15 have been developed [7\u20139]. However, the median survival of aggressive ATL is approximately 12 months with conventional chemotherapy alone [7, 10]. Although the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab (Mog) was approved for ATL, the addition of Mog to conventional chemotherapy did not contribute to better overall survival (OS) [11].",

Disease status at allo-HSCT was categorized according to the Japan Clinical Oncology Group criteria [15]. Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all clinical, microscopic, and radiographic evidence of ATL. In addition, all lymph nodes must regress to normal size (\u22641.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter), and previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm must decrease to <1.0 cm. The peripheral blood (PB) of HTLV-1 carriers often contains a small percentage of abnormal lymphocytes with polylobated nuclei, the so-called flower cells; provided that <5% of such cells remained, CR was judged to have been attained if the absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, was <4 \u00d7 109/L. Partial response (PR) was defined as a \u226550% reduction in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters of measurable lesion without the appearance of new lesions. PR also required a \u226550% reduction in absolute abnormal lymphocyte counts in PB. Progressive disease (PD) in PB was defined by a \u226550% increase relative to the lowest count of flower cells, and an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of \u22654 \u00d7 109/L. Stable disease (SD) was defined as any other disease status. Progression after allo-HSCT was defined as a \u226550% increase from the smallest sum of the products of the greatest diameters of measurable disease or the increase in the number of abnormal lymphocytes in PB or the appearance of new lesions. Relapse after allo-HSCT was defined as progression after CR.",

OS was estimated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and differences between groups were evaluated by the log-rank test. Relapse/progression and NRM were considered to be competing risk events. GVHD and NRM from any cause other than GVHD were considered as competing risk events. The probabilities of relapse/progression, NRM, and GVHD were estimated by the cumulative incidence function, and differences between groups were evaluated by the Gray test. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used for the analysis of OS, and Fine and Grey\u2019s regression was used for the analysis of relapse/progression and NRM in univariate and multivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, we included the following factors as covariates: patient age (<55 years vs. \u226555 years), patient gender (male vs. female), ATL clinical subtype (acute-type vs. lymphoma-type), disease status (CR/PR vs. SD/PD), time from diagnosis to allo-HSCT (<7 months vs. \u22657 months), donor type (related vs. unrelated), HLA compatibility (matched vs. mismatched), conditioning intensity (MAC vs. RIC), and GVHD prophylaxis (CSP-based vs. TAC-based).

On the other hand, local relapse/progression was common in patients with lymphoma-type ATL, and a significant proportion of these cases were successfully salvaged by DLI in combination with radiation. Itonaga et al. [24] reported the effectiveness of DLI in patients with relapse/progression after allo-HSCT.

However, considering the dismal outcomes with conventional chemotherapy and the favorable outcomes with allo-HSCT for patients in CR or PR, it would be reasonable to consider up-front allo-HSCT in patients with aggressive ATL when the disease is chemosensitive. Our group previously reported that in the setting of related HSCT, early allo-HSCT (<100 days after diagnosis) was associated with a favorable outcome compared with late allo-HSCT [25]. In addition, the patients who relapsed during chemotherapy had poor outcomes even if they received allo-HSCT [26]. In our current study, an interval longer than 7 months from diagnosis to allo-HSCT was associated with an increased risk of relapse/progression. This and other finding also support the idea of early up-front allo-HSCT in patients with aggressive ATL. In order to increase the proportion of patients who receive allo-HSCT when the disease is chemosensitive, alternative donors such as cord blood or haploidentical related HSCT could be considered in the treatment strategy for aggressive ATL. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the benefits of these approaches. Recently, our group reported a new prognostic index in transplant-eligible patients with aggressive ATL [27]. This index might be useful to determine the appropriate timing of allo-HSCT in patients with this disease. In addition, further improvement is needed in the management of patients with chemorefractory ATL as this population is at high risk of relapse/progression after allo-HSCT. One option might be Mog, as it was reported to be effective in half of patients with relapsed/refractory ATL [8, 9]. However, significant attention would have to be paid to the interval between the last Mog treatment and the initiation of allo-HSCT, and it would be reasonable to consider strategies to mitigate the risk of severe GVHD [28, 29].",

We were not able to demonstrate a clinical benefit of acute/chronic GVHD in patients with ATL, which is inconsistent with a previous study [22]. This could be due to the small size of our cohort, although it is one of the largest thus far of ATL patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Another limitation was possible selection bias. Our data showed favorable clinical outs in patients who received allo-HSCT compared with previous nationwide studies [12, 21\u201323]. It is possible that only fit patients were referred to our institute and we conducted allo-HSCT in that select group. In this regard, relapsed ATL patients after objective response before allo-HSCT who was expected to have a dismal outcome after allo-HSCT as previously reported were only seven patients in our cohort [26]. To rule this out, we require a database that includes both transplanted and non-transplanted cases.
