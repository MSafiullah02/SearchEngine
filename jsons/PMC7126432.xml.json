Moreover, 75% of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are classified as zoonoses and constitute a major public health problem around the world, responsible for over one million death and hundreds of millions of cases each year [45]. Furthermore, it is estimated that zoonoses cause over 20 billion and 200 billion USD of direct and indirect economic burden across the world respectively [27], [45]. Although the morbidity and mortality of most ID decreased, the incidence of zoonoses have increased [28]. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of zoonoses by systematic modeling and analyzing in order to control and mitigate these scourges should be a worldwide priority.",

That is, blood-sucking arthropod vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, fleas and sandflies play the role of connecting multiple hosts while potentially infecting them and getting infected during this process. Thus, formulating the dynamics of zoonoses requires understanding the ecology of all involved host species and their interactions with vector species that carry the pathogen between hosts. These complexities have made a comprehensive study of zoonoses very challenging, making mathematical models of zoonoses scarce and mainly focused on WNV [8] or directly transmitted zoonoses [2], [3], [30]. Recent research has been focused on understanding the dynamics and control of vector-borne zoonoses with one vector and two hosts (see [35], [39] for WNV, [14] for Chagas' disease, and [26], [33] for TBRF). Also, authors in [6] proposed a class of vector-borne zoonoses with an arbitrary number of hosts and one vector and provided the complete global dynamics of equilibria.",

For instance, over 65 different mosquito species transmit WNV to a number of hosts including humans, mammals and many species of birds [20], [34]. Another example of a highly complex zoonosis is the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). Indeed, as illustrated in [13], [31], the main vector of EEEV is the mosquito Culiseta melanura, which feeds exclusively on birds, and thus infects birds only. These birds infect, in turn, other mosquito species, which then bite humans, therefore creating a direct chain of transmission of the pathogen between a host and vector species with no direct link and/or transmissibility. Hence, as stated in [31], the elimination or mitigation of zoonoses requires breaking the multiple transmission cycles corresponding to each potential host and vector species.",

Moreover, we structure each host's infectious stage into n different \u201cages\u201d or classes where they infect each vector species at different rates. The proposed model provides a general framework in modeling zoonoses as it takes into account the complex patterns and multi-faceted host species dynamics along with their interactions with vector species. The derived class of models handles multiple levels of organizations including the case where some host or vector species have different epidemiological structures than others. Our modeling framework offers a plethora of possible scenarios and could be applied to study specific cases of zoonoses, and thus hopes to provide a forum that could help guide decisions on control efforts to mitigate and/or eradicate some zoonoses.",

            "text": "The second goal of the paper is to study the global asymptotic behavior of the proposed system. Particularly, we derive conditions under which the disease dies out or persists in all host species and vector species. A key threshold quantity happens to be the basic reproduction number R02(m,n,p) for the general system with m host, n stages, and p vector species. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) whenever R02(m,n,p)<1. The proof of the uniqueness of an endemic equilibrium (EE) for large epidemic systems is known to be challenging. Indeed, the uniqueness of an EE may not hold for multi-group directly transmitted diseases [38], [24] and sexually transmitted diseases [22]. The global dynamics of vector-borne diseases with one host species and one vector species have been investigated in different settings (see [10] for a model with time delays, [11] for a competitive exclusion result on a multi-strain model with distributed delay and [9] for the interplay between sterile and wild mosquitoes populations). For our system, a multi-host, multi-stage and multi-vector model, we will prove indeed that it has a unique strongly EE (in the sense of Thieme [42]) under the assumption that the host-vector network configuration is irreducible and R02(m,n,p)>1. To do so, we transformed the system at equilibrium into an auxiliary dynamical system and showed that the equilibrium of the newly crafted system, is globally attractive under the pre-cited hypotheses. Moreover, we will prove that the strongly EE is GAS whenever it exists. The latter relies on a carefully constructed Lyapunov function and elements of graph theory. The authors in [17], [18] first used tools of graph theory to study the GAS of the EE for multi-group models for directed transmitted diseases. To do so, they derived a Lyapunov function for the multi-group system from that of a single epidemic system. Also, in [36], [37], the authors used these tools to investigate for stage-progression models for water-borne diseases and the authors in [23] successfully generalized the approach to a multi-group vector-borne SIR\u2212SI system. For our model, the arbitrary number of host species, stages, and vector species (all potentially different) present specificities that make the approach employed the after-mentioned papers impractical. For instance, the construction of the Lyapunov function from that of one group does not apply in our case.",

The susceptible populations of host species i are generated through a constant recruitment \u039bi, subjected to a natural death rate of \u03bci and could be infected after being bitten by an infectious vector of any species j. After being infected, the susceptible populations of Host i become latent, who then become infectious after an incubation period of 1/\u03bdi. The infectiosity period of host species is structured into n stages, each characterizing the level of parasitemia in the corresponding host. At each stage l, the infectious of host i recover at a rate \u03b7l,i, progressing to the next stage of infection at a rate \u03b3l,i or naturally die at a rate \u03bci. The susceptible arthropod vectors of species j, Sv,j, could be infected by all infectious hosts, of any species and of any stage, at different rates. Moreover, they are replenished at a constant rate \u039bv,j and die either by natural death, at rate \u03bcv,j, or due to control strategies specific for each vector of species j, at a rate \u03b4v,j.",

The model is flexible and could be adapted to cases where different hosts could have different epidemiological structures with respect to the infection. This extends the work in [6], [26], [33] which consider the dynamics zoonoses and one vector species. Our model extend also the multi-host and multi-vector in [15] which explores and SIR-SI type of host-vector interaction. Particularly, our model consists of SEInR where the infection of each host is stratified into n infectious classes and each of these classes infect susceptible vectors at different rates. This extension captures a more realistic aspect of infection in the interactions between hosts and vectors. Moreover, although we considered an SI structure for the vectors for simplicity, the results of this paper are also valid if the vector species's dynamics follows an SEI structure. Indeed, for some vectors such as mosquitoes, their incubation period is often nearly two weeks, which is on the same scale as their lifespan, making an SEI model more suited for their dynamics.",

By letting F=DF(E,I)|E0 and V=DV(E,I)|E0, the Jacobian of F and V, evaluated at the DFE, we obtain: whereB=((A\u2218B1)T(A\u2218B2)T\u2026(A\u2218Bn)T), andV=(\u2212diag(\u03bc+\u03bd)0m,m\u20260m,m0m,pdiag(\u03bd)\u2212diag(\u03b11)\u20260m,m0m,p0m,mdiag(\u03b31)\u22f1\u22ee\u22ee\u22ee\u22f1\u22f1\u22ee\u22ee0m,m0m,mdiag(\u03b3n\u22121)\u2212diag(\u03b1n)0m,p0p,p0p,p0p,p0p,p\u2212diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)). It is worth noticing that the matrix B has m\u00d7n columns and so, the last row of F has mn+m+p=m(n+1)+p columns, in accordance with the first row of F, as A\u2218B\u22c4 has p columns. The matrix V is Metzler (positive off-diagonal entries) and therefore \u2212V\u22121\u22650\n[4]. Given the particular shape of the matrix V, the matrix-wise entries of \u2212V\u22121 are given by the induction relationship:(\u2212V\u22121)ij={0m,mif1\u2264i\u2264n+1,1\u2264i<j\u2264n+1diag\u22121(\u03b1i\u22121)if1\u2264i=j\u2264n+1,diag(\u03b3i\u22122)diag\u22121(\u03b1i)(\u2212V\u22121)i\u22121,jif2\u2264i\u2264n,1\u2264j<i\u2264n,0p,pifi=n+2,1\u2264j\u2264n+1,0p,pif1\u2264i\u2264n+1,j=n+2,diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)ifi=j=n+2, where \u03b10=\u03bc+\u03bd and \u03b30=\u03bd. Hence, we can deduce that(\u2212V\u22121)ij={0m,mif1\u2264i\u2264n+1,1\u2264i<j\u2264n+1diag\u22121(\u03b1i\u22121)if1\u2264i=j\u2264n+1,diag(\u03b3j\u22121\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3i\u22122)diag\u22121(\u03b1j\u22121\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1i\u22121)if2\u2264i\u2264n,1\u2264j<i\u2264n0p,pifi=n+2,1\u2264j\u2264n+1,0p,pif1\u2264i\u2264n+1,j=n+2,diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)ifi=j=n+2.

The basic reproduction number is the spectral radius of the next generation matrix. Hence, by denoting R0(m,n,p) the basic reproduction number of System (2) with n hosts, n infectious stages (in each host) and p vectors, we have: R0(m,n,p)=\u03c1(\u2212FV\u22121). The matrix \u2212FV\u22121 is an anti-diagonal block matrix, with \u03981 and A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v) the anti-diagonal entries. Therefore,R02(m,n,p)=\u03c1((\u2212FV\u22121)2)=\u03c1(\u03981A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v))=\u03c1(diag(Nv)(\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)T(\u2212V\u22121)l+1,1)diag\u22121(Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v))=\u03c1(diag(Nv)(\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)Tdiag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121\u2218\u03bd)diag\u22121((\u03bc+\u03bd)\u2218\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l))diag\u22121(Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)).

            "text": "The expression of the basic reproduction number R02(m,n,p) can be understood heuristically, using biological interpretations as follows. Indeed, since infection process requires a host species and a vector species, the transmission cycle has two steps: from host species to vector species and from vector species to host species. The first step is captured by \u03981 while the latter is represented by A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v). More specifically, when the host species are entirely susceptible, that is Ii=0Rm, for i\u2208{1,2,\u2026,n}, the transmission rate is diag\u22121(Nh)diag(Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4Iv=A\u2218B\u22c4Iv. Thus, the transmission rate per infectious vector of all species is A\u2218B\u22c4. However, the average life-span of infectious vectors, of all species, is diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v) units of time. Thus, a single infectious vector, accounting for all species, will produce an average of A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v) infected host species. Of these host species, a fraction diag(\u03bd)diag\u22121(\u03bc+\u03bd) will survive the latency period to become infectious. The probability of these hosts to survive until a stage l of the infection is:diag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121)diag\u22121(\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l)diag(\u03bd)diag\u22121(\u03bc+\u03bd)=diag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121\u2218\u03bd)diag\u22121((\u03bc+\u03bd)\u2218\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l). During this time, there is an average of diag(Nv)(A\u2218Bl)Tdiag\u22121(Nh) infectious bites by susceptible vector species. Thus, during its infectivity period, an infectious host, of all species, will infect on average:diag(Nv)(\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)Tdiag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121\u2218\u03bd)diag\u22121((\u03bc+\u03bd)\u2218\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l))diag\u22121(Nh) susceptible vectors of different species that bite them. Therefore, the net result of these two steps is, since we are dealing with matrices, the spectral radius ofdiag(Nv)(\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)Tdiag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121\u2218\u03bd)diag\u22121((\u03bc+\u03bd)\u2218\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l))diag\u22121(Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v), or, equivalently ofA\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)diag(Nv)(\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)Tdiag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121\u2218\u03bd)diag\u22121((\u03bc+\u03bd)\u2218\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l))diag\u22121(Nh). In the next section, we study the asymptotic properties of System (2). Particularly, we show that the dynamics of the system is completely determined by R02(m,n,p) under certain conditions.",

Since F is a nonnegative matrix and V is a Metzler matrix, we have (see [4]),\u03c1(\u2212FV\u22121)<1\u21d4\u03b1(F+V)<0 where \u03b1(F+V) is the stability modulus of F+V. Hence, the trajectories of the auxiliary system whose RHS is that of (3) converge to zero whenever R0(m,n,p)=\u03c1(\u2212FV\u22121)<1. Since all the variables are positive, by the comparison theorem [40], we conclude that(4)limt\u2192\u221e\u2061E=limt\u2192\u221e\u2061I1=\u2026=limt\u2192\u221e\u2061In=0mandlimt\u2192\u221e\u2061Iv=0p. Moreover, this implies that:(5)limt\u2192\u221e\u2061S=\u039bh\u2298\u03bchandlimt\u2192\u221e\u2061Sv=\u039bv\u2298(\u03bch+\u03b4v), where \u2298 denotes the Hadamard division. Relations (4) and (5) imply the attractivity of the DFE. Moreover, by [16], [43], the DFE is locally asymptotically stable whenever R02(m,n,p)<1. We conclude thus that the DFE is GAS whenever R02(m,n,p)<1.  \u25a1\n",

From (6), we express all Il\u204e (1\u2264l\u2264n) in terms of I1\u204e, as follows:(7)Il\u204e=diag(\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121)diag\u22121(\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l)I1\u204e. From (7), it follows that Il\u204e\u226b0, for any 1\u2264l\u2264n, if and only if I1\u204e\u226b0. Moreover, we can also express I1\u204e in terms of Iv\u204e and S\u204e since(8)I1\u204e=diag\u22121(\u03b11)diag(\u03bd)E\u204e=diag\u22121(\u03b11)diag\u22121(\u03bch+\u03bdh)diag(\u03bd)diag\u22121(Nh)diag(S\u204e)A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e Using the equilibrium relation stemming from the equation of infected vectors (in (6)), the relation Sv\u204e=Nv\u2212Iv\u204e, along with (7) and (8), we obtain(9)diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)Iv\u204e=diag(Nv\u2212Iv\u204e)\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)TDldiag(S\u204e)A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e, whereDl=diag\u22121(Nh)diag(\u03b30\u2218\u03b31\u2218\u03b32\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b3l\u22121)diag\u22121(\u03b10\u03b11\u2218\u03b12\u2218\u2026\u2218\u03b1l)diag\u22121(Nh) and \u03b10=\u03bch+\u03bdh and \u03b30=\u03bd. Now, we want to express S in terms of Iv\u204e. That will make (9) in terms of Iv\u204e only. By using the equation of susceptible in (6), we obtaindiag(S\u204e)=diag(Nh)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e)+diag\u22121(\u03bc). Hence, Equation (9) leads to:(10)diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)Iv\u204e=diag(Nv\u2212Iv\u204e)\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)TDl[diag(Nh)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e)+diag\u22121(\u03bc)]A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e=diag(Nv\u2212Iv\u204e)\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)TDldiag(Nh)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4Iv\u204e:=F(Iv\u204e) Thus, a unique strongly endemic equilibrium exists if and only if the vectorial equation (10) has a unique nonnegative solution. Moreover, notice that Equation (10) is satisfied if and only if Iv\u204e is an equilibrium of the auxiliary dynamical system:(11)x\u02d9=F(x)\u2212diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)x. Now, we will show that System (11) has unique equilibrium Iv\u204e\u226b0 if the connectivity matrix N is irreducible and R02(m,n,p)>1. To this end, we will use elements from monotone systems and particularly Hirsch's theorem [21]. Indeed, System (11) is monotone if and only if the vector field F(x)\u2212diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)x is, or equivalently whenever the F\u2032(x) is Metzler. That is, the off-diagonal elements of F\u2032(x) are positive. We have:(12)F\u2032(x)=(diag(Nv\u2212x)\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)TDldiag(Nh)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4x)\u2032=\u2212diag(\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)TDldiag(Nh)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4x)+diag(Nv\u2212x)\u2211l=1n(A\u2218Bl)TDldiag(Nh)(diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4x)\u2032, since the first term is a diagonal matrix. It follows from (12), that F\u2032(x) is Metzler as long as M:=(diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4x)\u2032 is. We have:M=(diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4x)\u2032=diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4+diag(A\u2218B\u22c4x)(diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh))\u2032=diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4+diag(A\u2218B\u22c4x)(\u2212diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh))=diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)(A\u2218B\u22c4diag(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)\u2212diag(A\u2218B\u22c4x)A\u2218B\u22c4)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)=diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh)A\u2218B\u22c4diag(\u03bc\u2218Nh)diag\u22121(A\u2218B\u22c4x+\u03bc\u2218Nh), as A\u2218B\u22c4diag(A\u2218B\u22c4x)=diag(A\u2218B\u22c4)A\u2218B\u22c4x. Hence, M and therefore F\u2032(x) is Metzler. Moreover, since the Host-Vector configuration N is irreducible, F\u2032(x) is irreducible. Thus, the auxiliary dynamical system (11) is strongly monotone. Moreover, it could be seen that the map of F\u2032(x) is monotonically decreasing. Since F(0Rp)\u2212diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)0Rp=0Rp and x\u2264Nv, by Hirsch's theorem ([21], page 55), the trajectories of the auxiliary system (11) either tend to the origin, or else there is a unique equilibrium Iv\u204e\u226b0 and all trajectories tend to Iv\u204e. The origin is unstable since, for G(x):=F(x)\u2212diag(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)x, we have \u03c1(G\u2032(0Rp))>1. Indeed, it could be shown easily that \u03c1(diag\u22121(\u03bcv+\u03b4v)F\u2032(0Rp))=R02(m,n,p). We have shown that if R02(m,n,p)>1 and the host-vector configuration is irreducible, a unique solution Iv\u204e\u226b0 of Equation (10) exists. Hence, using (6), (7), we deduce that E\u204e\u226b0 and Il\u204e\u226b0, for 1\u2264l\u2264n. We conclude therefore that System (2) has a unique strongly endemic equilibrium whenever R02(m,n,p)>1 and N is irreducible.  \u25a1\n",

By using the expressions of ck,i, we obtain:ck,i\u03b1k,i\u2212ck+1,i\u03b3k,i=1Ik,i\u204e\u2211j=1pwij\u2211i=1m\u2211l=kn\u03b2\u00afl,ji\u2212\u03b3k,i\u03b1k+1,iIk+1,i\u204e\u2211j=1pwij\u2211i=1m\u2211l=k+1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji=1Ik,i\u204e\u2211j=1pwij\u2211i=1m(\u2211l=kn\u03b2\u00afl,ji\u2212\u2211l=k+1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji)=1Ik,i\u204e\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u03b2\u00afk,jr. Substituting this expression of ck,i\u03b1k,i\u2212ck+1,i\u03b3k,i in (\u2605), we obtain:(\u2605\u2605)\u2211i=1mvi[\u2211k=1n(1Ik,i\u204e\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u03b2\u00afk,jr)Ik,i\u2212\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jrIl,rIl,r\u204e]=0. We work the second sum in (\u2605\u2605) out in order to obtain a factor of Ik,i and therefore compare it with the first one. We have:\u2211i=1mvi[\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jrIl,rIl,r\u204e]=\u2211i=1mvi[\u2211j=1pwij\u2211l=1n(\u2211r=1m\u03b2l,jrIl,rIl,r\u204e)]=\u2211i=1m[\u2211j=1p\u2211k=1n\u2211r=1mviwij\u03b2\u00afk,jrIk,rIk,r\u204e], obtained by replacing the index l by k for convenience. Now, by successively switching the subindices i and r; and using properties of nested sums, we obtain:\u2211i=1mvi[\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jrIl,rIl,r\u204e]=\u2211r=1m[\u2211j=1p\u2211k=1n\u2211i=1mvrwrj\u03b2\u00afk,jiIk,iIk,i\u204e]=\u2211i=1m\u2211k=1n[\u2211r=1m\u2211j=1pvrwrj\u03b2\u00afk,ji]Ik,iIk,i\u204e. Thus, showing (\u2605\u2605) is equivalent to show that:\u2211r=1m\u2211j=1pvrwrj\u03b2\u00afk,ji=vi\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u03b2\u00afk,jr This is also equivalent to:(\u2605\u2605\u2605)\u2211r=1m\u2211j=1pvrwrj\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji=vi\u2211j=1pwij\u2211r=1m\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,jr Showing (\u2605\u2605\u2605) concludes the proof of (\u2605). We notice that the relation (\u2605\u2605\u2605) is satisfied if vi are the components of the solution of the linear system B\u00afv=0, with(16)B\u00af=(\u266311\u266312\u2026\u26631m\u266321\u266322\u2026\u26632m\u22ee\u22ee\u22f1\u22ee\u2663m1\u2663m2\u2026\u2663mm), where\u2663kk=\u2211j=1pwkj(\u2212\u2211i=1,i\u2260km\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji) and\u2663ik=\u2211j=1pwkj\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji,\u2200k\u2260i. Moreover, we have:\u2211i=1m\u2663ik=\u2663kk+\u2211i=1,i\u2260km\u2663ik=\u2211j=1pwkj(\u2212\u2211i=1,i\u2260km\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji)+\u2211i=1,i\u2260km\u2211j=1pwkj\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji=0. Since the Host-Vector connectivity configuration N is irreducible, the matrix B\u00af is also irreducible. Thus, it could be shown easily that dim\u2061(ker\u2061(B\u00af))=1. Moreover, vi=\u2212Cii where Cii is the cofactor of the i-th diagonal of B\u00af. Also, Cii<0 for all i=1,2,\u2026,m. Thus, there exists v=(v1,v2,\u2026,vm)T\u226b0 such that B\u00afv=0. We choose the coefficients vi of Vi in Lyapunov function are as such.To show (\u2605\u2605\u2605), we start by its left hand side (LHS):LHS(\u2605\u2605\u2605)=\u2211r=1m\u2211j=1p(vrwrj\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji)=\u2211r=1,r\u2260imvr\u2211j=1p(wrj\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji)+vi\u2211j=1p(wij\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji). However, B\u00afv=0 implies that, for any i, \u2663iivi+\u2211r=1,r\u2260im\u2663irvr=0. Therefore,\u2211j=1pwij(\u2212\u2211r=1,r\u2260im\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jr)vi+\u2211r=1,r\u2260im(\u2211j=1pwrj\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji)vr=0 Thus, using the properties of nested again, LHS(\u2605\u2605\u2605) becomesLHS(\u2605\u2605\u2605)=\u2211r=1,r\u2260imvr\u2211j=1p(wrj\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji)+vi\u2211j=1p(wij\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji)=\u2211j=1pwij(\u2211r=1,r\u2260im\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jr)vi+vi\u2211j=1p(wij\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji)=vi\u2211j=1pwij(\u2211r=1,r\u2260im\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jr+\u2211k=1n\u03b2\u00afk,ji)=vi\u2211j=1pwij(\u2211r=1m\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,jr), which is exactly the right hand side of (\u2605\u2605\u2605).In summary, Relation (\u2605), obtained through (\u2605\u2605) and (\u2605\u2605\u2605) cancels linear terms in Il,i, for 1\u2264l\u2264n, in the expression of V\u02d9 given in relation (15). Thus, the latter yields to:(17)V\u02d9=\u2211i=1mvi[\u2211j=1pai,j\u03b2i,j\u22c4Si\u204eIv,j\u204eNi(2\u2212Si\u204eSi\u2212Ei\u204eEiSiSi\u204eIv,jIv,j\u204e\u2212EiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,i)\u2212\u2211k=2nck,i\u03b1k,iIk,i\u204eIk\u22121,iIk\u22121,i\u204eIk,i\u204eIk,i+\u2211k=1nck,i\u03b1k,iIk,i\u204e+\u2211j=1pwij\u2211i=1m\u2211l=1n\u03b2\u00afl,ji(2\u2212Sv,j\u204eSv,j\u2212Iv,j\u204eIv,jSv,jSv,j\u204eIl,iIl,i\u204e)+Ah,i+\u2211j=1pwijAv,j].

The terms Av,j and Ah,i are clearly definite-negative. Note that, taken separately, the two sums S1 and S2 in (21) are not definite negative. Hence, to finish the proof, we will prove that the sum S1+S2 is definite-negative. To do so, we look at the coefficients of the sums from the graph-theoretical standpoint, following the same approach as [17], [18], [19], [23]. Indeed, let G(N) be the directed graph that represents the connectivity N between the m hosts (including the l stages) and p vectors. Since the Host-Vector connectivity configuration N is irreducible, it follows that graph G(N) is strongly connected. Recall that, for i=1,2,\u2026,m, vi are components of the solution of the system B\u00afv=0, where B\u00af is given by (16). The matrix B\u00af is the so-called Laplacian matrix and its associated the graph G(B\u00af) is strongly connected since B\u00af is irreducible, since N is. Moreover, the solution of B\u00afv=0 is given by the Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem [7], [32] as follows:vi=\u2211T\u2208Tiw(T) where Ti is the set of all spanning trees T of G(B\u00af) rooted at Host i. Particularly,w(T)=\u220f(m,l,r,j)\u2208E(T)\u03b2\u00afl,jmwrj, where E(T) is the set of all arcs in T. For our setup, an arc (i,l,i\u2032,j) describes an infection arc that starts from Host i, at stage l directed to Host i\u2032 through Vector j. From a modeling standpoint, vi connects Host i to all vectors (through \u03b2\u00afl,ji) and connect all vectors to all hosts but i (through wkj, with k\u2260i). By using Cayley's formula [1], [32], each vi=Cii is the sum of nm\u22121pm\u22121mm\u22122 terms, each of which is the product of m\u2032\u22121\nwkj\u03b2\u00afl,ji with k\u2260i. These wkj\u03b2\u00afl,ji represent the weight of each spanning tree Ti, rooted at Host i.Now, we investigate what each term of viwij\u03b2\u00afl,jr represents in terms of the graph G(B\u00af) and its spanning trees. Indeed, each term in viwij\u03b2\u00afl,jr for all i,j,l,r is a weight of a unicyclic graph of a particular length, obtained by adding an arc (r,l,i,j) to a directed tree rooted at Host i, T\u2208Ti. The obtained unicyclic graph Q has a unique cycle CQ of length 1\u2264d\u2264m. We group all isomorphic cycles as they will have the same coefficients. Hence, we conclude that S1+S2 is the sum over all unicyclic graphs as S1+S2=\u2211QSQ, where(22)SQ=w(Q1)\u2211(i,1,r,j)\u2208E(CQ1)(5\u2212Si\u204eSi\u2212Ei\u204eSiIv,jEiSi\u204eIv,j\u204e\u2212EiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,i\u2212Sv,j\u204eSv,j\u2212Iv,j\u204eSv,jI1,rIv,jSv,j\u204eI1,r\u204e)+w(Q2)\u2211(i,l,r,j)\u2208E(CQ2)(4+l\u2212Si\u204eSi\u2212Ei\u204eEiSiSi\u204eIv,jIv,j\u204e\u2212EiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,i\u2212Sv,j\u204eSv,j\u2212Iv,j\u204eIv,jSv,jSv,j\u204eIl,rIl,r\u204e\u2212\u2211k=2lIk\u22121,rIk\u22121,r\u204eIk,r\u204eIk,r)+w(Q3)\u2211(i,l,r,j)\u2208E(CQ3)(9+l\u2212Si\u204eSi\u2212Ei\u204eEiSiSi\u204eIv,jIv,j\u204e\u2212EiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,i\u2212Sv,j\u204eSv,j\u2212Iv,j\u204eSv,jI1,rIv,jSv,j\u204eI1,r\u204e\u2212Si\u204eSi\u2212Ei\u204eEiSiSi\u204eIv,jIv,j\u204e\u2212EiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,i\u2212Sv,j\u204eSv,j\u2212Iv,j\u204eIv,jSv,jSv,j\u204eIl,rIl,r\u204e\u2212\u2211k=2lIk\u22121,rIk\u22121,r\u204eIk,r\u204eIk,r), where CQ1, CQ2 (for which l\u22652) and CQ3 represents the cycles that correspond to elements in S1, S2 and S1+S2 exclusively. Now, each of the three sums in (22) are definite-negative. Indeed, we have:\u220f(i,1,r,j)\u2208E(CQ1)Si\u204eSiEi\u204eSiIv,jEiSi\u204eIv,j\u204eEiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,iSv,j\u204eSv,jIv,j\u204eSv,jI1,rIv,jSv,j\u204eI1,r\u204e=\u220f(i,1,r,j)\u2208E(CQ1)I1,i\u204eI1,iI1,rI1,r\u204e=1, since CQ1 is a cycle. Also,\u220f(i,l,r,j)\u2208E(CQ2)Si\u204eSiEi\u204eEiSiSi\u204eIv,jIv,j\u204eEiEi\u204eI1,i\u204eI1,iSv,j\u204eSv,jIv,j\u204eIv,jSv,jSv,j\u204eIl,rIl,r\u204e\u220fk=2lIk\u22121,rIk\u22121,r\u204eIk,r\u204eIk,r=\u220f(i,l,r,j)\u2208E(CQ2)I1,i\u204eI1,iIl,rIl,r\u204e\u220fk=2lIk\u22121,rIk\u22121,r\u204eIk,r\u204eIk,r=1. Similarly, the product of the non constant terms in the last sum (22) is equal to 1 as CQ3 is a cycle.Hence, by the arithmetic-geometric mean, SQ is definite-negative for each unicyclic graph Q. It follows from (21), that V\u02d9 is definite-negative. Thus, the global stability of the EE follows from the Lyapunov stability theorem. This ends the proof.  \u25a1\n",

We computed the basic reproduction number of the general system R02(m,n,p), for m hosts, n hosts' infectious stages and p vectors species. We proved that the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever R02(m,n,p)<1 (Theorem 3.1). Under the assumption the host-vector network configuration is irreducible, we proved that there exists a unique \u201cstrongly\u201d endemic equilibrium as long as R02(m,n,p)>1 and that, it is GAS whenever it exists. This result is new and improves previous results of [6], for which the global result for multiple hosts and one vector is given, and of [15] in which a case of multi-species, multi-vector is considered but no stability results were given.",

The uniqueness and the global stability of the strongly endemic equilibrium requires the irreducibility of the host-vector network (Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3), leading to the conclusion that the disease either dies out or persists in all hosts and all vectors. That is, controlling the disease requires an intervention in all hosts. This is close to impossible, given that some hosts are not even known. Furthermore, in some cases the natural habitats of some hosts and vectors are so apart that it is unlikely there is a direct transmission between these hosts and vector for an infection to take place. This could collapse the irreducibility of the hosts-vectors configuration. Thus, it is important to investigate the global asymptotic behavior of the solutions when the host-vector network configuration is reducible. This is the subject of a separate study and will be published elsewhere.",
