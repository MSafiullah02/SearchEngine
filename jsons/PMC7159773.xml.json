Interestingly, the prevalence of smokers among asthmatics is almost the same as it is in the general population. It has been shown that it is more difficult to maintain asthma control in smokers with asthma than in nonsmokers with asthma. Altered airway inflammation and corticosteroid insensitivity are thought to be the mechanisms behind the adverse effects of smoking in asthma patients.8, 9, 10, 11\n",

Traditionally, sensitizers to occupational asthma have been divided into high\u2013molecular weight compounds (HMW) and low\u2013molecular weight compounds (LMW).49 The most relevant causes of HMW agents include flour dust, enzymes (plant and animal derived), gums, foods, tobacco, rubber\u2010derived proteins, animal\u2010derived and insect\u2010derived allergens, and fish/seafood\u2013derived allergens.

During this same time period, the increased use of antibiotics, improved hygiene, and urbanization presumably decreased childhood exposure to previously common infections, diverse environmental microorganisms, and their products.61, 62 These events, suggest an inverse relationship between microbiologic diversity and atopic disease, also known as the hygiene hypothesis. An early and prolonged imbalanced expression of the TH2 allergic phenotype can persist in those without an appropriate TH1\u2010directed response to infection in early life. This is supported by mouse models in which pathogen exposure before allergic sensitization favors decreased airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and TH2\u2010related cytokines with allergen re\u2010exposure.63 Recognition of the human microbiome and its systemic immune\u2010modulatory effects further contribute to the hygiene hypothesis although the hypothesis remains somewhat controversial and more studies are needed to evaluate the role of \u201chygiene\u201d in the development and prevention of allergic diseases.",
