These systems are labelled gastroretentive drug delivery systems (GRDDSs), which demarcate an important frontier in gastric and drug transport therapies that require gastric absorption and/or local action. Consequently, these systems circumvent the short retention time caused by gastric emptying and some physicochemical limitation, such as low solubility of some drugs.",

The orientation of these polymeric chains gives rise to different allomorphs of chitin, forming anti-parallel and parallel arrangements known as alpha, beta and gamma-chitin. Chitin is a hydrophobic polymer, with fewer applications than CS, because it is not dispersible in aqueous, acids and alkaline media, being possible its dispersion only in hexafluoroisopropanol and chloroalcohols. Chitin is usually found in exoskeletons of invertebrate animals as crabs, lobsters, shrimps, cockroaches and scorpions. In addition to these sources, chitin and CS also occur naturally in some fungi like Mucor rouxii (30% of total mass) and Choanephora cucurbitarum (28% of total mass) [18,19].",

This effect can occur due to a downregulation of Ca2+-dependent pathways [57]. In addition, CS antioxidant activity is directly associated with the chemical reactivity of the hydroxyl and amino groups from the C-6 and C-2 carbons, respectively [58]. Substitutions performed on CS by reducing the DD promote the exposure of more amino groups in the polymer chain increasing its antioxidant activity. The biopolymer chain reduction (MW) also exerts a positive effect on the CS antioxidant activity. Smaller biopolymer chains are very rigid, so the intra-chain hydrogen bonds that involve hydroxyl groups and amino acids are less intense than the same interactions in larger chains with more conformational freedom [45]. Thus, smaller polymer chains can interact more efficiently with oxidant molecules inhibiting their action.",

In this scenario, CS with MW between 105 and 106 Da displayed less coagulant capacity whereas CS with higher MW in physiological saline solution were more efficient in inducing erythrocyte aggregation. The effect of MW in CS suggests that long chains can interact with more platelets, promoting greater efficiency in hemostasis. Therefore, when DD is high the influence of MW on platelet aggregation is reduced. This effect is more pronounced by reducing DD, indicating that DD is the most important factor for platelet aggregation [54,65].

This is due to the polycatalytic CS character, which contributes to the establishment of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with solvent and mucus. The CS DD is the main factor responsible for the cationic nature of this polymer, so that the reduction of the DD is directly associated with the increase in the positive charge's density of the chain, which contributes to the inter- and intra-chain CS repulsion. Thus, in acid media, the chains with the lowest DD will be more protonated and separated from each other, because of the electrostatic repulsion. The polymer protonation exposes groups previously inaccessible to the solvent, increasing the capacity to establish more hydrogen bonds, having an impact on PF hydration. The hydrated chains swell, increasing the adhesion area, interpenetration and interaction with mucus and water, through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. These interactions are the result of a pronounced increase in the conformational freedom of these hydrated chains [112,115].",

However, the use of polymers with excessively long chains is deleterious to mucoadhesive systems because they lose the ability to diffuse and entangle the mucus.

Posteriorly, they were also adapted for treatment of humans by Johnson and Rowe [127].

However, some authors relate that the cutt-off size of pylorus cannot be determined exactly [130].

These systems, also called plug type systems [134] receive this classification precisely because after administration they undergo a great expansion of their structure, which may be related to both a high swelling or unfolding, blocking their passage through the pylorus. In this way, the permanence of the system in the stomach is increased until drug release begins with subsequent reduction in size as the system is evacuated through the GIT.",

However, its bioavailability after oral administration is significantly low (<1%) due to reduced intestinal absorption and the fact that when administered with food it leads to the formation of complexes that cannot be absorbed [140]. Although alendronate is mainly absorbed in the upper portions of the GIT, the short transit time further contributes to low absorption and bioavailability. Another marked limitation is the local irritation caused in the upper portions of the GIT. Thus, treatment requires daily a strict fasting state close to the medication schedule, reducing patient compliance. In this sense, it seems evident that the development of delivery systems that manage to overcome the rapid transit time of the upper GIT by increasing its residence time at the absorption site, should contribute significantly to improving the therapeutic efficacy of alendronate.",

The excellent properties seen in CS, such as a high degree of swelling and mucoadhesiveness in gastric media, are decisive to delay clearance through the pyloric sphincter, as well as making the system's contact with the gastric mucosa more intimate, respectively, contributing to the enhancement of alendronate absorption. However, it is known that CS rapidly dissolves in the stomach, which would impair the prolongation of the alendronate release rates, reason why ring-opened (ro) polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was rationally added to the composition. In this way, gastroretentive properties were evaluated in terms of swelling ability and mucoadhesive measurements. Authors stated that tablets from CS/roPVP hydrogels showed an optimal swelling (up to 500%) which higher axial than lateral swelling ratio, which was attributed to the application of compression force axially. Likewise, increasing proportions of CS in CS/roPVP complex were responsible for the raise of forces of mucoadhesion. It was interesting to note that in vitro release profile of the reference FOSAMAX\u00ae was 100% in only 30 min, while the complexes promoted sustained release of alendronate. The set of acquired properties contributed to 3-fold enhancement of the oral alendronate bioavailability.",

Since this mechanism acts to avoid the clearance of the pharmaceutical form through of the pylorus, a pronounced swelling is required which promotes a considerable increase in the size of the structures. This means that although many hydrophilic polymers undergo swelling when in contact with gastric fluid, it may not occur to the extent necessary to prevent its clearance from the upper GIT. In these cases, its importance is more related to the mucoadhesiveness and/or flutuation of the gel layer formed by CS swelling, as is the case with works that explore the dual mechanism of gastroretention, for example, floating and swelling [141]. The said gel layer of the swollen CS is also related to the decreased toxicity of some drugs interacting with their cationic groups by the presence of negative charges (alendronate sodium, for example).",

In vitro assays showed that at lower pressure (55 MPa) floating time higher than 8 h were achieved.

The formed gelatinous barrier retains the capsule shape, avoiding the system disintegration promoting controlled drug release. The gelatinous surface erosion favors water permeation into inner layers preserving the surface hydration and the air trapped by the swollen polymers promotes buoyancy to the dosage forms, as depicted in Fig. 8\n[79,135,151]. In addition, drug release is controlled by diffusion and dependent on the gel barrier erosion/dissolution.

Considering the above mentioned, some approaches [135,[159], [160], [161]] have been developed to improve the efficiency of these dosage forms such as the design of bilayer formulations, as displayed in Fig. 9\n. In these dosage forms, one layer promotes the fluctuation in gastric liquid whereas the other one control the drug release [135]. Oth et al. [161] fabricated a bilayer floating dosage unit containing misoprostol aiming to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers. As shown in Fig. 9A, both layers are composed by the same swellable polymer (in this case HPMC) but only one containing the misoprostol allowing this a bifunctional system performed buoyance and drug delivery independently in gastric media. Authors demonstrated that the production of large capsules lead to an increasing in gastric retention time (GRT). In vivo studies exhibited GRT dependent to the meal regimen. After a single meal, GRT was higher than 3 h whereas after several meals, the GRT was higher than 10 h. He et al. [160] produced bilayer floating tablet formulation (Fig. 9B) containing the combination of two distinct drugs such as metformin hydrochloride (MH) and pioglitazone hydrochloride (PG) to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This formulation comprises the incorporation of each drug into two separate layers in order to achieve sustained MH release followed by immediate PG release. The bilayer tablet was fabricated by using wet granulation method with HPMC E5 for both layers as matrix and then compressed into tablet. In vitro assays showed buoyance time up to 24 h and floating lag time of 5 min besides sustained MH release controlled by diffusion manner (for 12 h) and fast PG release. In vivo tests performed in dogs suggested good absorption of PG and the enhancement of MH bioavailability with steady plasma concentration, decreased maximum plasma concentration and reduced time of maximum concentration appears as effective and promising GRDDSs to treat T2DM. Kr\u00f6gel and Bodmeier [159] developed multifunctional floating drug delivery systems using HPMC as hydrophilic polymer containing drugs (chlorpheniramine maleate or ibuprofen). One of the designed GRDDSs consists of two tablets (HPC + drug) fixed within two orifices of the cylinder (Fig. 9C) with air entrapped in the middle of the two tablets resulting in low density and, consequently, buoyance to the proposed system. Authors reported interesting GRDDSs that provides an enhancement on drug release as a function of HPMC viscosity and content, aqueous drug solubility and surface area of the matrix.",

Beyond that, fast and high drug concentration release could be avoided and, consequently, gastrointestinal tract irritation [79,154]. Hooda et al. [164] reported the preparation of MUFS based on CS and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) via ionotropic gelation method containing Ranitidine hydrochloride (RHCl) as microspheres GRDDSs. RHCl has a narrow absorption window and is mainly absorbed in the proximal areas of GIT. Thus, conventional sustained-release dosage form reaches the colon, where it gets metabolized, resulting in low absorption and poor bioavailability (52%). In this way, Hooda et al. [163] proposed to design microspheres GRDDs based on chitosan (CS) and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) via ionotropic gelation containing RHCl. In vitro buoyance and mucoadhesive tests suggested that these microspheres present interesting floating (at least 12 h of buoyance) and bioadhesive properties. The above mentioned properties allowed the fabricated microspheres adhere to the gastric mucosal surface remaining prolonged period in stomach ensuring RHCl stability in gastric environment which eventually leads to better bioavailability at much lower dose. Additionally, in vitro drug release assays displayed a zero-order model suggesting that the RHCl transport across polymeric matrix occurred by a Fickian diffusion process.",

Separation and drying processes were performed by using air convection and freeze-drying. The alginate beads show porous structure that promotes buoyance for over 12 h besides increasing the residence time in gastric tract substantially (>5.5 h) [139,163]. Dey et al.

Sunflower oil was entrapped in this system to improve floating time. All these polymers were chosen to encapsulate amoxicillin trihydrate aiming to treat Helicobacter pylori infection. The floating and mucoadhesive system were prepared by ionotropic gelation method and CS used as polymer barrier promoting bioadhesion.

Beyond that, these GRDDSs show fast buoyance than other floating dosage forms, improving therapeutic efficacy been easily administrated (once a day) to the patient [139]. On the other hand, the stability of these GRDDSs are susceptible to chemical modifications, like: oxidation and hydrolysis. Exposure to the temperature and pH variation as well as types of radiation (ultraviolet-visible, X-ray, among others) could also promotes modification in these systems [139]. El Nabawari [170] demonstrated the preparation of a floating raft system with Mebeverine HCl (MbH) using sodium alginate, HPMC K100M and precirol. The optimized formulation (FRS-11: sodium alginate 3%/HPMC K100M 1%/precirol 2%) displayed floating lag time and total buoyance time near to 15 s and 12 h (in simulated gastric media), respectively. In contrast, FRS-11 formulation exhibited sustained drug release of 82% up to 8 h showing good MbH bioavailability compared to the commercial product. These results suggest the designed raft-forming system as a potential GRDDS to prolong drug action aiming clinical trials [170,171].",

By using high-density systems (from 2.5 to 3.0 g mL\u22121) the gastric retention time can increase up to 25 h [155]. These systems are formulated with inorganic compounds such as barium sulphate, zinc oxide, iron powder and titanium dioxide increasing the density of the dosage form. However, up to now no effective action of these systems were detected in human just in pre-clinical assays [151,155,172]. In addition, the main drawbacks regarding high-density systems consist on the fabrication of pellets with high drug concentration and achieve systems with a density next to 3 g mL\u22121 [172].",
