            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS\u2010CoV, a member of the Betacoronavirus genus lineage C, was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. As of January 29, 2018, there were 2,123 laboratory\u2010confirmed human MERS\u2010CoV cases reported to WHO, including at least 740 MERS\u2010CoV\u2010related deaths (WHO, 2018). Multiple studies suggest that dromedary camels are a major source for human MERS\u2010CoV infection. MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibodies have been detected in the serum of dromedary camels across Northern Africa, including Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Somalia, and across the Arabian Peninsula, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and United Arab Emirates (Corman et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2014). MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies have been detected in 30\u2010year\u2010old archived camel serum samples, suggesting long\u2010term circulation of MERS\u2010CoV in dromedaries in this region (Muller et al., 2014). MERS\u2010CoV genome has been detected, isolated and sequenced from camel respiratory specimens in Northern Africa, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, and from an air sample of a camel barn owned by a known MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected human (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2015; Haagmans et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014). Genomic and epidemiologic studies comparing MERS\u2010CoV sequences from household clusters and camels, and of dromedary farms and human contacts in UAE (Muhairi et al., 2016; Paden et al., 2017), and of patients with corresponding MERS\u2010CoV\u2010positive camels in Saudi Arabia (Kasem et al., 2017) demonstrate that camels are a potential source of human MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

Farm A (n = 9) was located east of Jerusalem; farms B\u2010D (n = 15, 27 and 20, respectively) were located in the Negev desert, in southern Israel. The origin of these camels prior to their association with these four locations is unknown. These camels were used in the tourism industry. This study included both male (n = 19) and female (n = 52) camels ages 3 to over 20 years old. Blood samples were taken by jugular vein puncture. Serum samples were obtained on the day of collection from unclotted blood using serum separator tubes. All serum specimens were shipped to the CDC and inactivated by gamma irradiation at 5 \u00d7 106 rads in a Cobalt irradiator to inactivate potential pathogens, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. The study was approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Study 18\u20136\u201013).",

As MERS\u2010CoV neutralization titres increased to \u2265640 (n = 15), MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific titres determined by IFA also increased above 100. Sixteen of the 71 (22.5%) camels had lower MERS\u2010CoV serum neutralizing antibody titres, ranging from 20 to 40 (Table 2). For these 16 camels, the IFA titres were equal to 100 for three camels (Table 2 and Figure 1b), less than 100 for six camels, and indeterminate for the remaining seven camels. For the remaining 20 (28.2%) camels, serum neutralizing antibody titres were less than 20 or below the level of detection, with MERS\u2010CoV antibody titres, by IFA, either <100 (n = 15; Figure 1c) or indeterminate (n = 5; data not shown). Attempts to detect coronavirus genomic material by RT\u2010PCR from the camel sera were unsuccessful. The inability to detect genomic material may in part be due to three key factors in this study; one, specimen collection was not optimized for nucleic acid preservation; two, prior to study, sera were irradiated at 5 \u00d7 106 rads upon arrival at the CDC per importation requirements; and three, camels may not have had acute infections at the time of serum collection.",

Nine of 42 (21.4%) camels with MERS\u2010CoV microneutralization titres were negative for BCoV\u2010reactive serum antibodies, including one camel with a MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific neutralization titre of 640, three were indeterminate (7%) with the remaining 30 sera (71.4%) demonstrating reactivity to BCoV. Fourteen of the 20 camels (70%) with no detectable MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibody titres (titres <20) were positive for BCoV\u2010reactive antibodies at a 1:100 dilution. Serum antibodies from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia demonstrated reactivity to both MERS\u2010CoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013), suggesting that the presence of BCoV antibodies may impair the ability to specifically detect MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibodies. However, antibodies specific to MERS\u2010CoV did not neutralize BCoV or SARS\u2010CoV infection, nor did BCoV\u2010specific antibodies neutralize MERS\u2010CoV infection (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013). Consistent with those findings, antiserum against BCoV did not cross\u2010neutralize MERS\u2010CoV in the Mnt used in this study, confirming the specificity of the assay to discriminate between the two viruses (data not shown).",

While the results do not rule out antibody cross\u2010reactivity, the inability of BCoV immune sera to neutralize MERS\u2010CoV suggests that the presence of BCoV\u2010specific antibodies did not appear to impact the ability to specifically detect MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific by Mnt. The circulation of MERS\u2010CoV or a closely related virus in dromedary camels in Israel in the absence of any reported clinical cases of MERS\u2010CoV in the Israeli population suggests that there may be other factors involved in the dynamics of camel\u2010to\u2010human transmission of MERS\u2010CoV beyond circulation within camel herds.",
