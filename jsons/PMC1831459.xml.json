However, uniform graft rejections were seen when TBI conditioning was decreased to 1 Gy. In contrast, most dogs showed sustained engraftment when 1-Gy TBI was preceded by intravenous injections of both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the marrow donor and T-cell costimulatory blocker CTLA4-Ig [3]. Here we used 1-Gy TBI conditioning to evaluate whether blockade of another costimulatory pathway\u2014the interaction between CD40 and CD154\u2014was equally effective in enhancing marrow engraftment. Blockade of this pathway has been successful in murine models of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and different animal models of solid organ transplantation [4, 5, 6].",

The cells were washed, counted, and resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated canine serum, 2 mmol of L-glutamine, 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL of streptomycin, and 50 \u03bcmol of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol at a concentration of 4 \u00d7 106 cells per mL. Then 1-mL cell suspension samples were plated on a 24-well plate (1 sample per plate). Ionomycin and PMA were added to the lymphocyte culture at final concentrations of 5 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Medium and supplements were obtained from Gibco Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). The PBMCs were cultivated for 4.5 hours, then harvested, washed, and resuspended in PBS with 2% goat serum and 0.2% sodium azide. Cells were counted, the concentration was adjusted to 1 \u00d7 106/mL, and the cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 minutes. After removal of the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of mAb solution (concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL), incubated on ice for 30 minutes, and then washed with 1 mL of PBS + 2% goat serum and 0.2% sodium azide.

Anti-CD154 mAb 5c8 reduced the 3H-thymidine uptake to 35% compared with medium alone (P < .0001). CTLA4-Ig reduced the MLR response to 20% (P < .0001). The difference in MLR reactivities between mAb 5c8 and CTLA4-Ig was significant (P = .04). Increasing the mAb 5c8 concentration beyond 10 \u03bcg/mL did not further decrease 3H-thymidine uptake, whereas 5 \u03bcg/mL mAb 5c8 also led to significant MLR suppression (P = .002; data not shown). A concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL did not significantly decrease 3H-thymidine uptake.",

Only limited pharmacokinetic data for anti-CD154 mAb have been reported in the literature [17, 18]. Two studies examined the pharmacokinetics of humanized anti-CD154 mAbs (5c8 [17] and IDEC-131 [17, 18]) in monkeys. No antibody responses against these mAbs were detected in the primates. In both studies, the suppression of T-cell\u2013dependent B-cell responses against soluble antigens (tetanus toxoid [17] or ovalbumin [17, 18]) were used to determine the in vivo efficacy of the antibodies. In both studies, single 5-mg/kg doses of anti-CD154 mAb effectively suppressed the antibody responses against the foreign antigens, although the humanized mAb 5c8 did not result in complete suppression, even at a mAb dose of 20 mg/kg. In the present study, complete MLR suppression was not observed even with high doses of mAb 5c8. We chose the smallest antibody dose for in vivo studies that achieved serum antibody levels >10 \u03bcg/mL for at least 5 days. This was realizable with a single mAb dose of 5 mg/kg IV, because the serum concentration of mAb 5c8 was 39 \u03bcg/mL even 5 days after injection.",

The emerging canine antibodies likely determined the tempo of clearance of mAb 5c8 from the circulation. The development of IgG responses without preceding IgM responses was surprising, because the dogs had no known previous exposure to mouse immunoglobulin. In 2 of the 3 dogs analyzed, anti-idiotype or idiotype-like antibodies were found. Unlike the mice, the dogs were not maintained in pathogen-free conditions, which might have resulted in more educated immune systems [19, 20].",

Given the increasing number of newly discovered T-cell regulatory and costimulatory molecules [21], it seems likely that the blockade of only one system might not have been sufficient to overcome host resistance after a low-intensity or very-low-intensity conditioning regimen. Perhaps combining anti-CD154 mAb and CTLA4-Ig might be synergistic or additive and lead to more uniform sustained engraftment, as has been described in murine models of marrow and islet transplantation [22, 23, 24].",
