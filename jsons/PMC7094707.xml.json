It is a cleavage product from a polyprotein precursor. Its location in the polyprotein follows the two structural proteins E1 and E2 (reviewed in [23]) and is succeeded by non-structural (NS) proteins. Protein p7, together with subsequent protein NS2, is found to act at an early stage of virion morphogenesis [21]. Its function is to support, possibly together with the crosslinked heterodimer E1 and E2 glycoproteins as well as NS2, capsid assembly at the plasma membrane [24]. Experimental results indicate that these proteins initiate the release of RNA-containing core proteins from lipid droplets.",

NMR spectroscopic measurements have identified the monomeric protein with two TMDs in a hairpin motif with each of the helices being segmented into two smaller units [27], [28] as well as the protein in an oligomeric state forming a hexameric bundle [29]. A feature of the bundle models built from the hairpin monomers is a ring of histidines (His-17s) pointing into the putative lumen of the pore [30]. The oligomeric architecture suggests an \u2018i + 3\u2019 motif in which the C terminal helix of one monomer interacts/links with the N terminal helix of the third monomer. There is currently no information of how the different architectures are related to each other. Negative stain transmission EM data mostly identify a hexameric assembly for the protein [11], [31] as well as GT specific heptameric bundle [26].",

Thus, secondary structure prediction programmes can be applied to identify the length of a putative TMD and the respective amino acids can be translated into a helical conformer. In case of polytopic proteins TMDs need to be assembled to form a monomer using a docking approach [32], [33]. These structures form the basis for simulating functional data, such as ion conductance, which can be compared with those from experiments [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39].",

Briefly, the two GT 1a TMDs are assembled into a monomer (monomer-1a) first, followed by assembling six copies of monomer-1a around a pseudo six-fold symmetry axis into a bundle (bundle-1a). The conformational space for both of the assemblies, the monomer and the bundle, is screened by varying the degrees of distance, rotational angle and tilt stepwise as follows: (i) inter helical distance in steps of 0.25 \u00c5 covering 7.5 \u00c5 to 13.0 \u00c5 for monomers and 11.75 \u00c5 to 20 \u00c5 for hexameric bundles; (ii) rotational angles around the helical axis in steps of 5\u00b0 covering 360\u00b0; and (iii) tilt in steps of 2\u00b0 covering \u2212 36\u00b0 to + 36\u00b0. At each position, the conformation of the side chains was introduced choosing the most likely conformation from an internal library of the MOE software suit (www.chemcomp.com). At this stage, 15 steps of steepest descent minimization followed to remove \u2018bad\u2019 (overlaps) van-der-Waals contacts. Any extensive minimization is compensated by a fine grained, in terms of step width of the three degrees of freedom such as distance, rotational and tilt angle, search of the conformational space. Potential energy of each conformer was evaluated, using AMBER94. The docking was done using a dielectric constant of \u03b5 = 2 to mimic the environment of the bilayer.",

[43] were adopted. Lipids which overlapped with the helices were removed. The protein\u2013lipid system was hydrated and, after steps of minimization (2000 steps of steepest decent and 5000 steps of conjugated gradient), it was equilibrated for a total of 1.9 ns.

The first two simulations (100 K and 200 K) were run for 200 ps each, the third simulation (310 K) was run for 500 ps.

The rearrangement of the latter is so that especially Arg-60 interacts with the head groups of the opposing leaflet of the lipid bilayer, which leads to a thinning of the bilayer (Fig. 6\n). The movement of the helices in bundle-5a can be best described as a swinging of H1 into the pore and a movement of the arginine rich H3 (Trp-48 to Pro-58) to the opposing head group region, leaving H2 almost unaffected.

As a general feature, the protocol delivers monomers and bundles of parallel aligned TMDs. Experimental data from NMR spectroscopy confirm the model [28], [42], [50], [51]. It is suggested, that the two TMDs range from Val-6 to Cys-27 and Pro-38 to Pro-58 [50], [51]. Each of the two helices consists of two segments which are separated by Ala-16 to His-17 of TMD1 and Trp-48 to Pro-49 of TMD2. In another study helical regions are suggested from Leu-2 to Ala-14 and Leu-19 to Ile-32, as well as Ala-40 to Ala-56 [28]. Using DPC, p7 is found to exist in an oligomeric state adopting the hairpin motif [28], as well as in the \u2018unusual architecture\u2019 [29]. In p7 of GT 5a, it seems that two adjacent phenylalanines which are at positions 25 and 26 in GT 1a/1b, are shifted by one helical turn to positions 19 and 20. Thus, a phenylalanine is missing for the suggested \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking motif comprised of Phe-26, Trp-30, Tyr-45 reported to support the hairpin motif and putatively responsible for the formation of the middle helix, H2, in bundle-5a [28]. In bundle-5a instead, Phe-19 and -20 are part of a hydrophobic pocket accessible from the outside of the bundle [29], with Phe-19 being reported to contribute to harbour amantadine. Another striking feature of the 5a-sequence is the two arginines (Arg-54, -57) at the C terminus. They are not observed in the other GTs and confess most likely another reason for the structural difference between bundle-1a/1b and -5a [52]. At this stage it is considered, that the experimental conditions used in various NMR-experiments support either the monomeric appearance of the protein (bundles-1a/1b) or the oligomeric state (bundles-2a/5a). When simulating the monomer out of bundle-5a it tends to develop into an almost parallel alignment as shown in this study. Consequently, aforementioned phylogenetic differences between 1a/1b and 5a strains can cause considerable differences in structural features.",

A single amino acid mutation in the core protein of HCV GT3 leads to an increase in GT 3-specific steatosis [55]. These features underline further, that the change of a single amino acid or just a few can alter conformational dynamics and structural features which result in highly diverse GT specific features despite a moderate difference of ~ 30% at the nucleotide level [56].",

Computationally derived models, based on a docking approach, are screened by fitting respective assembled lowest energy bundle structures into an existing EM structure available for a proposed hexameric p7 bundle. Fitting the initial bundle to experimental data, is reasonable in as much an experiment is the ultimate validation of computational data. At this stage, simulating the monomeric model prior to further assembly into larger oligomers is a reasonable and essential step to generate bundle models which match experimental finding.
