They investigated IR spectra of homogenized tissues to find disease indicators, but used a single beam and manually scanned instruments which resulted in low sensitivity and reproducibility.

The results showed that SERS combined with these multivariate methods can be used as a rapid methodology for identification and viral classification. In the study by Moor et al.

This transfer can be measured, yielding an NMR spectrum. From the produced spectrum, it is possible to identify information regarding the chemical structure of the samples being analyzed.",

Meyer and Peters (2003) [20] in their review on the use of NMR spectroscopy techniques in screening and identifying ligand binding to protein receptors make a good discussion on the use of the transferred NOE effect for detecting and characterizing the ligand binding, the use of chemical-shift changes in identification of the ligand binding and the binding pocket of the receptor, as well as the use of relaxation times and diffusion to identify ligand binding and the conditions for NMR spectroscopy screening and binding characterization [20]. Wang et al. (2014) [21] in their study compared the plasma metabolic profiles of patients with Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), PBC/AIH overlap syndrome (OS) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) with those from healthy individuals attempting to identify biomarkers for AIH. From the information obtained by NMR, it was concluded that there are 9 biomarkers with greatest discriminant significance: citrate, glutamine, acetone, pyruvate, \u03b2-hydroxyisobutyrate, acetoacetate, histidine, dimethylamine, and creatinine. Significantly higher amounts of these metabolites were found in patients with AIH compared to healthy controls or other diseases. The diagnostic capacity based on these biomarkers was evaluated, where sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were obtained above 93% in discriminating the AIH from PBC, DILI and OS [21]. In addition, Galal et al. (2016) [22] in their study on chronic viral hepatitis C in the pediatric age group used 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), where they concluded that 1H MRS is a non-invasive technique that has good potential as a diagnostic tool for evaluating staging and fibrosis chronic asymptomatic hepatitis C [22].",

Using Raman spectroscopy it is possible to detect the presence of a wide range of polar or non-polar chemical bonds, including cellular changes. In this technique, the photons from a monochromatic light source interact with the chemical bonds present in the sample. These photons are absorbed (increasing the vibrational energy of the molecules), and then released (causing the vibrational energy of the molecules to return to their initial state). In this process an inelastic scattering phenomenon can occur, which is when the molecule does not return to a vibratory state of initial energy; then the released photon has a frequency deviation, which maintains the equilibrium of the system. This happens with less than 1% of absorbed photons and 99% are emitted due to elastic scattering. This anomalous scattering can be measured to give what is known as a Raman signal [24]. The inelastic scattering is composed of Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering, which occurs in 1 in 10 million absorbed photons; where the first (Stoke scattering) occurs when the molecule absorbs part of the energy of the incoming wavelength, thereby emitting a wavelength of less energy than the wavelength received; and the anti-Stokes scattering occurs when the molecule releases a wavelength of greater energy than that absorbed. This happens under certain circumstances where the molecule is in a partially excited energy state before absorbing the wavelength received.",

(2015) [26] demonstrated the potential of 150 nm gold nanoparticles to generate surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signals to analyze biological samples, noting that high Raman regions co-localize with the presence of these nanoparticles. Compared with smaller nanoparticles (40 nm), the larger nanoparticles (150 nm) are more easily detectable. Moreover, instead of the signal spreading throughout the cell surface, it appears to be highly localized in the regions surrounding these nanoparticles, giving support to the SERS effect theory. Another advantage of larger nanoparticles is that although their aggregates, even individual particles can be optically observed. This allows areas with abundance of these nanoparticles to be manually oriented for analysis, making it possible to acquire highly enhanced spectra more easily [26]. However, in view of the nanoscale dimension of the viral particle, the use of nanoparticles is inconsistent in the reproducibility of spectral enhancement. As a solution to this inconsistency, a specific marker such as made by Fogarty et al. (2014) [27] can be used, where a two-step protocol with cationic gold particles followed by silver intensification to generate silver nanoparticles on the cell surface was used with SERS of endothelial cell membrane, facilitating the collection of enhanced spectra. This methodology generates a 100-fold increase of the SERS spectral signal [27]. Thus, one way of indirectly identifying the presence of a specific virus would be to detect the presence of antibodies induced by the virus tagged with nanoparticles through SERS signals.",

When working with NIR spectroscopy in the investigation of biological samples, the most useful region is between 650 and 1000 nm (called the \u201coptical window\u201d), because there is great absorption of hemoglobin and water below 650 nm and above 1000 nm, respectively, hindering other signals in these regions.

This technique analyzes the fluorescence capacity of a sample [17], where a beam of high energy light (usually in the ultraviolet region) is irradiated on the sample to be excited into a higher electronic energy level; then the fluorophore molecule will rapidly lose energy to this environment through non-radiative modes (called internal conversion) and will return to the lowest vibrational level of the lowest electronic excited state. The molecule persists at this vibronic level for a period of time known as the fluorescence lifetime, and then returns to the fundamental electronic state by emitting a photon with energy lower than the irradiated one [37]. The excitation and emission spectrum are recorded by the instrument and is generally used to build excitation-emission (EEM) fluorescence matrices.",

This basic principle, for example, can be used to study protein interactions.

However, this is often not observed. Spectra are generally raised to values above zero due to a phenomenon called Mie scattering [23], [41]. This phenomenon occurs when some biochemical structures through which IR radiation passes have a size comparable to or greater than the wavelength of IR light, causing light scattering [25]. In solid materials, the baseline is also affected by non-homogenous particle sizes, which likewise cause light scattering. In addition, the baseline slope is affected by reflection, temperature, concentration or anomalies of the instrument used. These effects can be minimized through a variety of baseline correction techniques, such as multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) [42], standard normal variate (SNV) [42], and derivative [43], among others [33], [44], [45].",

This technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the sample's data and generate a new visualization. Dimensionality reduction occurs through a linear transformation of the original variables, generating orthogonal variables called principal components (PC). The first main component has a greater ability to explain the observed variance in the data than the second PC, which in turn has a greater explanation of the data than the third PC, and so on. In this way, it is possible to choose the smallest number of principal components with the largest explained variance, so that the dimensionality can be reduced with the certainty that important information of the samples is not lost [23]. Generally, few PC's (10\u201320) provide more than 99% of the observed variance of the original data [47]. Each PC is composed by a score (projections of the samples on the PC direction) and a loading (angle cosines of the variables projected on the PC direction) [48], [49]. PCA allows visualization of the data set in reduced size where segregation between classes can be revealed (Fig. 4\n) [47].",

HCA (using Ward method [56]) is considered the most capable of correlating spectral data with histopathology, but is more time-consuming [34]. Another difference between these techniques is that HCA does not require making assumptions about the number of data classes, whereas KMC and FCA require this information. HCA starts with separate clusters, and merges the clusters that have the closest distance from each other (usually based on Euclidian distance) in each step, so there is a reduced number of clusters in each step until only one remains [34], [55].",

For this, PLS finds a set of new maximally correlated variables orthogonal to each other, similar to PCA. However, it makes use of the respective object labels for this decomposition, thus being a supervised technique [23]. For discriminatory purpose, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is employed. PLS-DA is a linear classification technique for which the classification criterion is obtained by PLS analysis [46]. Therefore, it makes use of PLS to find a straight line that divides the data space into two-regions, where each region is related to the space of each class [57].",

This can solve the ambiguity problems generated by PCA providing a more reliable class differentiation. For PCA-LDA the cluster vector is obtained by calculating the mean cluster scores matrix and the loading matrix for each cluster, and then the cluster loading matrix is obtained by summing the loadings weighted by the mean cluster scores [50]. On the other hand, for stepwise-LDA the cluster vector is obtained by firstly selecting a single prominent spectral peak and then LDA is applied to this wavenumber across all data, generating a Gaussian posterior density fitted to each group. Thereafter, one data point is left out and the Gaussian is used to estimate the predicted posterior class probability for that spectrum across all class categories (at that one specific wavenumber). This is reaped for all spectra and after for all wavenumbers. At the end, the predicted class probability for each data point is compared with the known true class value (e.g., 0 or 1); and these absolute deviations for each wavenumber are summed to give a sum of absolute posterior misclassification, where a plot of this error against wavenumber are then analogous to peaks on a PCA loadings plot, in which they indicate wavenumbers that best distinguish one particular class from the rest [50].",

Each chromosome is assigned an aptitude through a mathematical function called fitness function, where chromosomes with the highest fitness value are copied and the chromosomes with the lowest fitness value are eliminated in a step called the selection step. After the selection step, genetic operators are probabilistically applied. The mutation operator makes a variable that is selected to be unselected or vice-versa, and the crossover operator crosses the chromosomes. This process is involved in a generation, and can be repeated for as many generations as are requested. In the end, the population with the better variables is selected based on a cost function [66] (see Fig. 12\n).",

Viral testing is now essential for the care of a number of patient groups, including hospitalized patients with acute respiratory infections; transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients; patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV); and infants with possible congenital infection. Multiple test methods continue to be used, but molecular tests are emerging as the dominant technology. A variety of commercial molecular assays have been or are in the process of being approved or cleared as in vitro diagnostic tests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is an important development because it makes viral diagnostic testing available to more laboratories, and it improves the standardization of diagnostic testing. The scope of diagnostic virology has broadened [68]. General categories of viral diagnosis/research testing and the viruses included in those categories are shown in Table 6\n.",
