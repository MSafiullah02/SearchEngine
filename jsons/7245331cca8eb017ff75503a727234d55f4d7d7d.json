Contaminated areas/items included patient care areas housing COVID-19 patients, common hospital objects/items, such as self-service printers, desktops, doorknobs, and keyboards, medical equipment, and HCWs' PPE, such as gloves, eye protection, and face shields. These findings suggest that the hospital environment could potentially be a source of virus spread, including among HCWs, patients, and visitors. It is noteworthy that the hospital surface samples were collected from February 7 to February 27, 2020, which was after human-to-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 was identified. It is plausible to assume that the hospital surface contamination would have been more severe before the sampling period, when environmental cleaning protocols were not as extensive and HCWs were processes. It is, therefore, a standardize procedure to lessen the intensity and to reduce frequency of the internal infection control processes in the department, which may have led to the high positive detection rates discovered from our study. It was not surprising that the Fever Clinic had a low positive detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 (6.5%). Early on, the Fever Clinic was relocated to a semi-open area, which was well-ventilated. In addition, unlike the obstetric isolation ward, strict infection prevention measures were instituted in the Fever Clinic. These practices likely led to the low positive detection rate.",

            "text": "not aware of the potential risk of indirect contact spread. HCWs may have unwittingly spread the virus throughout the hospital via contaminated hands, PPE, and equipment. Direct or indirect contact with these potentially highly contaminated surfaces may account for the first wave of patients into the hospital and the early cases of healthcare associated transmission among HCWs and visitors. The WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Report stated that HCW occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may not play a significant role in transmission, based on the limited cases investigated.(12) However, the data in this study suggests that hospital environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 is extensive, which could be an important occupational risk for HCWs. Generally speaking, HCWs have better infection prevention knowledge and practice compared to general populations. Despite this, 2,055 infected HCWs have been confirmed from healthcare facilities across China by February 20, 2020. These exposures may have been related to multiple factors. Hospitals were providing care to COVID-19 patients for over a month before human-to-human spread was formally identified as one important transmission mode on January 20, 2020. During this time, widespread hospital contamination from SARS-CoV-2 could have led to occupational exposure for HCWs workingin the hospital setting on a daily basis. Immediately after recognizing that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading through human-to-human, the hospital became overcrowded by a massive patient surge. This sudden, unusually high demand for medical care far exceeded the hospital's capacity.Hospital waiting time extended to hours and families commonly had to seek care at multiple facilities before they could be seen. This increased the time before infected individuals were identified and placed into isolation, which could have contributed to healthcare-associated disease transmission. In addition, during the early stages of the outbreak, HCWs did not always follow standard infection prevention measures due to a lack of medical supplies, especially in areas not designated as infection-specific units. For example, critical infection prevention measures, such as wearing respiratory and eye protection, gowns, and gloves, were not instituted for HCWs in non-infection units. Furthermore, the study hospital experienced a sudden transition from a comprehensive medical center to a focused care center for COVID-I9 infected and confirmed patients in order to respond to the patient surge. This transition occurred in a matter of days. The majority of HCWs in the hospital had no direct experience with this type of outbreak, and a significant proportion HCWs in non-infection units did not receive infection prevention training during the outbreak. These sudden changes may have led to higher exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs as well as causing massive hospital surface contamination fromSARS-CoV-2.In this study, the most contaminated hospital zones included the ICU that specialized in caring for COVID-I9 patients, the Obstetric Isolation Ward only taking care of pregnant women with COVID-I9 infection, and the Isolation Ward for COVID-I9 patients. It was surprising to observe the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the isolation ward for pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-I9. In China, it is a custom for multiple family members and friends to visit pregnant women around the time of delivery and the average hospitalization for pregnant women giving birth usually lasts more than five days. Isolation of pregnant women and new mothers during hospitalization has been challenging and often impossible. Family members and friends infected with or carrying SARS-CoV-2 could have contaminated the obstetric isolation ward during their visits. This finding emphasizes the need for strict isolation practices that should be implemented rapidly. In addition, pregnant women and neonates are highly susceptible populations. They are more sensitive to the chemicals released by the internal infection control",

            "text": "Eye protection and face shields would likely become contaminated by infected patients' respiratory droplets or infectious aerosols (if produced by COVID-19), or by the HCWs' own hands during donning or doffing. This study's data supports the idea that contaminated gloves orhands may be a possible exposure route for SARS-CoV-2. Patients and visitors usually do not wear gloves in hospital settings. Contaminated hands and surfaces could potentially lead to SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Hospitals should emphasize the critical role of hand hygiene as a way to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study has several limitations. SARS-CoV-2 culture samples were not collected; thus, exact bioburden levels were unable to be determined. No air samples were collected during the investigation. This study focused on hospital surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs as a surrogate of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We were limited in our ability to characterize other exposure factors, such as other exposure routes, frequencies, and duration. A lack of resources also meant that we were unable to conduct a comprehensive exposure study for the HCWs working in the hospital in the midst of the ongoing outbreak. Many environmental surfaces were contaminated with COIVD-19 RNA across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The contamination could be caused by viral shedding from infected patients and/or indirect contact by HCWs, patients, and visitors. These findings emphasize the need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.",
