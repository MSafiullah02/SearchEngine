With this strategy, transmission should be less than 1% in women who either know their status, or are diagnosed early in pregnancy and are retained in care on an effective regimen [1, 2]. However, as vertical HIV transmission risk decreases there is increasing recognition of adverse health impacts suffered by HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) infants, including vulnerability to developing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and tuberculosis (TB) due to socioeconomic status and adverse environmental conditions such as maternal ill health and lack of breastfeeding [3]. In these infants there is also increasing recognition of immune dysfunction including immune activation, altered T-cell numbers and function, and possibly humoral immunity [3].",

In 2013, it was estimated that globally there were 240,000 new pediatric HIV infections [4]. In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, perinatally infected infants and children have high morbidity and mortality, with 50% dying by the age of 2 years in low resource settings [5]. Despite the high early mortality without ART, many perinatally infected children have slowly progressive disease and some may only be diagnosed in late childhood or adolescence [6]. As established by clinical, epidemiological and postmortem studies, LRTIs are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children. LRTIs in HIV-infected children are from common childhood respiratory pathogens (viral and bacterial), as well as opportunistic pathogens, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [7\u201311].",

All of the countries with HIV prevalence of more than 10% in persons aged 15\u201349 years are in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 90% of all HIV-infected children live in this region [3, 12, 13]. In addition, all of the countries with a TB incidence of more than 500 cases per 100,000 population are in sub-Saharan Africa, although large case numbers are also found in Asian countries with high population numbers [12]. In settings with a high burden of both TB and HIV, high rates of co-infection are reported and up to 56% of children treated for TB in sub-Saharan Africa are considered to be HIV-infected [8]. Studies of HIV cohorts confirm high rates of incident and prevalent TB. In Cape Town, South Africa, TB program data suggested a TB incidence of 1596 cases per 100,000 among HIV-infected infants prior to the implementation of universal ART [14], while clinical cohort data identified 53 cases per 100 patient-years in children not on ART [15]. A randomized-controlled trial to assess the effect of universal isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected children found a TB disease rate of 121 per 1000 patient-years in children who had early ART access [16].",

Irrespective of the setting, it remains crucial to test all TB patients for HIV. This is highlighted by cohort reports from multiple settings; in the United Kingdom, 8 of 18 TB/HIV co-infected children presented with TB, which prompted their HIV diagnosis [17]. Studies of older children and adolescents in Zimbabwe found a high yield of new HIV diagnosis in adolescents presenting with TB [18]. Rates of TB are not only increased in HIV-infected infants, but evidence suggests that HEU infants are also at increased risk for TB. Data from South Africa suggest this risk may be 4-fold that of the general population [19], with rates of 41 cases per 1000 child-years reported in HEU infants [16].",

HIV-infected adults are 21\u201334 times more likely to develop TB in high burden settings, with TB accounting for up to a quarter of HIV-associated mortality [20]. Woman of child-bearing age are disproportionately affected [21], which implies a high risk of household TB exposure in vulnerable young HIV-infected and HEU children [22]. In a study of IPT in high TB burden settings, 10% of HIV-exposed infants had contact with potential source cases by the age of 14 weeks [23]. If TB in HIV-infected pregnant women is missed, the infants are not only at risk of TB, but have a 3-fold higher HIV acquisition rate [24]. Where there are no strategies to identify mothers with sputum smear-negative TB, there may be significant delays in diagnosis and extended exposure of young children to risk of infection [25, 26].",

When ART is initiated in older children, reductions in presumed and confirmed incident TB of 32\u201370% are documented [8]. Nevertheless, HIV-infected children have more TB than their uninfected peers, including in low-burden settings [8, 30].

Access to ART with broad penetration into the community will impact the epidemiology of TB, because there will be a decrease in adult cases of pulmonary disease. This is already clear from the decline in adult and pediatric TB cases in South Africa as the adult ART uptake increased.

In HIV-infected children there are no studies assessing post-exposure prevention; however, in a cohort of 494 children beginning ART when younger than 24 months of age in Cape Town, 127 courses of post-exposure IPT were provided, with only two children developing confirmed TB. Both had fully drug-susceptible isolates [28]. In a prospective study of prevention in older HIV-infected children, many with a history of prior TB infection, both all-cause mortality (16% in the placebo arm vs. 8% in the IPT arm) and incident cases of TB (9.9% vs. 3.8%) declined [37]. A subsequent reanalysis assessing the role of IPT and ART in these children found that the greatest reduction was in children receiving both ART and IPT [38]. In contrast, a pre-exposure prevention study enrolling very young infants found high rates of TB in HIV-infected and HEU infants, but no differences between those receiving IPT and placebo [16]. In this study, drug resistance was found to play an important role in IPT failure [39]. When present, children typically have primary rather than secondarily acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. HIV infection was independently associated with prevalent TB disease among child household contacts of adult MDR-TB cases and with failure of MDR preventative therapy [40]. In South African children with MDR-TB, HIV infection was reported in 54, 77, and 22% of cases from Johannesburg, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and Cape Town, respectively [41\u201343]. Reviewing the susceptibility/resistance patterns of adult contacts with TB is an essential component of managing children with HIV, irrespective of whether or not they have TB at the time. In children with MDR-TB, HIV is associated with a poorer outcome [44, 45].",

There are, however, ongoing concerns over nevirapine dosing and recommendations on dose adjustments have been suggested [57]. Table 1 summarizes important considerations when treating TB/HIV co-infection [58\u201361]. In co-treated children, efavirenz has not been associated with worse outcomes, but despite reassuring data on the pharmacokinetic outcomes of lopinavir-ritonavir 1:1 concurrent TB therapy may be a risk factor for failure in children on lopinavir-ritonavir treatment [62\u201364]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends a non-suppressive regimen of zidovidine, lamivudine and abacavir in children needing rifampicin as a short-term measure to avoid drug interactions [65]. This is based on the ARROW study. In ARROW, three nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were studied as an intensive induction and maintenance strategy when combined with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Fifty-nine of the 1143 children required a drug alteration for TB that included stopping or replacing the NNRTI nevirapine. In contrast, children taking efavirenz did not require a drug switch. Triple NRTI for HIV suppression was effective at 36 weeks, but not at 144 weeks. The advantage of this latter strategy is that, although viral suppression is inferior, the risk of progressive NNRTI and protease inhibitor (PI) ART resistance was avoided and drug\u2013drug interactions and logistic complications were minimized [66]. There is no current guidance on using integrase inhibitors and other PIs such as darunavir in children, and no data on newer anti-TB agents such as bedaquiline and delamanid in HIV-infected children. Nevertheless, ART should be initiated 2\u20138 weeks after starting TB therapy so as to reduce the risk of IRIS occurring [61]. For example, in TB meningitis cases deterioration due to paradoxical IRIS can be devastating and ART should be delayed at least 4 weeks [67, 68]. In Table 2 we highlight key messages to consider in TB and HIV co-infected children. TB may be an important challenge and opportunity in achieving the UNAID 90\u201390\u201390 targets [69].\n\n",

HIV-infected children are at increased risk of pneumonia that requires hospital admission and death from this infection.

Of these cases, 1.3 million (90%) pneumonia episodes and 93% of the deaths occurred in children younger than 5 years of age from the Africa region. HIV-infected children had a 6.5 (95% CI 5.9\u20137.2) increase in odds of pneumonia that required hospitalization and they had an increased risk of death (odds ratio 5.9, 95% CI 2.7\u201312.7) [7]. The authors showed that there is also a wide variation between countries; for example, in Zimbabwe 55% of all pneumonia deaths are attributed to HIV, compared to 1% in India [7].",

A wide range of pathogens causing LRTIs and pneumonia in children with HIV is reported [73].

Compared with HEU children, there is an increased incidence of hospitalization (3\u20135-fold) in children with HIV, and they tend to stay in hospital longer and have a higher risk of death. In a South African study of RSV-associated LRTI infection, 49 of the 1157 children with confirmed RSV were HIV-infected. In this study, ART data was only available for 12 cases, 6 of whom received ART. Four of the 9 deaths in this study occurred in HIV-infected children; however, their ART data are unknown [87].",

In a prospective South African study, pandemic and seasonal H1N1 influenza had a similar clinical course in HIV-infected children [90]. Giannattasio et al. reported on 11 HIV-infected and 30 otherwise healthy children hospitalized for H1N1 influenza. Leukopenia was recorded in 64% of HIV-infected and in 20% of healthy children (p = 0.01). Interstitial pneumonia was more frequent in HIV-positive children and consolidation was more frequent in HIV-negative children. Overall, 91% of HIV-positive children received oseltamivir. The H1N1 influenza attack rate was very high (20%) in HIV-infected children, but it consistently ran a mild course [91]. Annual vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended, but efficacy may be influenced by decreased vaccine immunogenicity reported in some studies [92].",

Congenital and post-partum acquisition of CMV is common in HIV-exposed and infected infants and CMV infection may be associated with breastfeeding acquisition of HIV [95, 96]. The role of co-infection with CMV in children, especially those suspected of having P. jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), is poorly understood, but CMV itself can cause fatal pneumonia [94, 97]. Postmortem studies from Africa reported that in the 0\u20135 months age group, CMV (42.1%) was the second most common cause of fatal pneumonia after P. jirovecci (51.3%) [9]. The isolation of CMV by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from various sites or specimens does not prove that the child has CMV pneumonia. The chest radiographic appearance of PJP and CMV pneumonia can be very similar (diffuse alveolar disease). In children being ventilated for PJP and not responding to treatment for PJP, CMV was histologically proven in 72% of cases and associated with a poor outcome [97, 98]. CMV viremia is common in all infants with pneumonia, and a viral logarithmic load (to the base 10) of 4.6 or more was predictive of pneumonia in a study of from Cape Town [99]. In HIV-infected infants with severe pneumonia from suspected PJP, we would suggest that empiric treatment for CMV infection with either ganciclovir or valgancyclovir be used wherever possible, until such time that CMV infection can be excluded.",

HIV-infected children with measles are significantly younger than uninfected children and often have not yet received the first vaccination of their primary measles containing vaccine schedule, even if that is scheduled at 9 months of age [102, 103].

Measles is generally thought to be more severe in HIV-infected children\u2014both the duration of illness prior to hospitalization and the duration of hospitalization is longer [102, 103]. In low-resource settings, the case fatality rate is 2\u20137-fold higher in children with HIV [103, 104].

The chest radiograph findings show increased lung volumes (78%) and diffuse parenchymal opacification (64%) that lead ultimately to diffuse alveolar opacification (92%). This usually happens within 72 h of presentation [107].
