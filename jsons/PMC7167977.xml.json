            "text": "With 200 million people infected worldwide, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become a global health problem and a major cause of viral hepatitis. Persistent infection occurs in 70% of infected patients followed by some serious complications such as inflammation, insulin resistance, steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathology associated with chronic HCV infection was initially thought to be related with HCV\u2010specific immune responses 1, 2. But now there are some who view that direct cytopathic effects (CPEs) in virally infected cells also contribute substantially to HCV\u2010associated liver injury 3, 4. The cellular mechanisms by which HCV replication might mediate liver injury are not entirely clear. Sekine\u2010Osajima et al investigated the cellular effects of HCV infection and replication using the HCV\u2010JFH1 cell culture system and found that HCV\u2010JFH1 infected cells contained substantial CPE that was characterized by massive apoptotic cell death with much expression of several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\u2010induced proteins 5. Moreover, in HCV\u2010JFH1 transfected Huh\u20107.5.1 cells, death occurred when all the cells were infected and the intracellular HCV RNA reached maximum levels 6. Mishima et al further identified that mutant viruses with individual C2441S, P2938S, or R2985P signature substitutions enhanced virus replication and protein expression in the early/acute stages of infection, which finally led to massive cell death 7. In addition, they also found that HCV\u2010induced cytopathogenicity was closely associated with the level of intracellular viral replication and determined by certain amino acid substitutions in HCV\u2010NS5A and \u2010NS5B regions. Unfortunately, all of these studies were based on a recombinant virus model of liver cancer cells, and there are inevitable metabolic differences existing between hepatoma cell lines and quiescent primary hepatocytes. It is apparent that these cell lines cannot fully recapitulate all aspects of HCV infection in the liver, or the host responses playing important roles in determination of viral persistence or clearance 8. In our previous study, we have established an infection system based on human fetal liver stem cells (hFLSCs) which could completely exhibit the entire blood\u2010borne HCV (bbHCV) life cycle including transmission of the virus efficiently between cells. In the process of model building, we found that mitochondrial alterations and ER stress contribute a lot to our better understanding of HCV pathogenesis and provide insight into the HCV life cycle. Therefore, we focused on using this cell model to investigate the effect of HCV infection on cells in vitro.",

Whether the established infection model could simulate and undergo CPE similar to lesions observed in hepatitis patients could be a measure of the model's success. The presentation of HCV\u2010induced CPE is vital in cell culture systems, and could contribute to the understanding of HCV pathogenesis. In our system, CPEs induced by bbHCV infection including ER distention, mitochondrial swelling and cell vacuolization were similar to cell lesions derived from chronic HCV patients. The mechanisms of the pathogenesis induced by bbHCV infection might be traced back to ER\u2010stress and mitochondria\u2010related/caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis in hFLSCs at the early stages of infection. With time going on, apoptosis would gradually be inhibited by the increasing expression of bcl\u2010XL, the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, the survival pathway of PI3\u2010kinase\u2010AKT/PKB, and the sequestering of p53. NF\u2010\u03baB activation disrupts the balance between the survival cells and the infected cells by inhibiting apoptosis. The accelerated cycles of cell apoptosis, regeneration and repair resulting from HCV infection could shorten the cell death cycle and give rise to the development of cirrhosis, and ultimately lead to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",

Then, the HIF\u20101\u03b1 subunit being located in nuclei could cause inhibition of respiratory activity, with depression of the mitochondrial complex I along with uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency 15. Our data also provided a strong demonstration that ATP production increased in cells infected by bbHCV. An over\u2010compensatory glycolytic metabolic response might be responsible for the phenomenon above by impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. In addition, bbHCV\u2010induced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation impairment is associated with oxidative stress that clearly tracks to the mitochondrial compartment where the ROS O2\u2212 is first formed; then the ROS O2\u2212 triggers the permeability transition pore through which cytochrome c could be released and diffuse into the cytosol. Ultimately, the cytochrome c would induce the apoptotic program and cause subsequent cell damage.",

High serum HCV levels pre\u2010 and postliver transplant were associated with cholestatic fibrosis, a severe form of hepatitis 16. EM of HCV RNA\u2010positive liver biopsies showed that the hepatocytes would undergo vacuolation and lysis of membrane organelles, degeneration of mitochondria, dilatation of cytoplasmic reticulum tubules, and formation of an appreciable amount of large polymorphic secondary phagosomes 17. Kasprzak et al summed up the data on nuclear lesions of liver biopsies with chronic HCV infection, involving swelling, altered shape, hyperchromasia, disturbed nuclear chromatin structure; and the nuclear lesions always occurred in the cells with changes in rough ER within long tubular structures or branching fibrils inside 18. Other cytoplasmic changes included mitochondrial lesions, numerous lipid vacuoles and free tubular structure of a highly osmiophilic character 18. Similarly, Falc\u00f3n et al studied liver biopsies from patients with chronic HCV infection 19. They found that all liver biopsy samples from these 13 chronically HCV\u2010infected patients showed ultrastructural cell damage. Ballooning hepatocytes with dilatation of the ER and mitochondria were observed. More importantly, studies have shown that fibrosis progress was more vulnerable in coinfected patients with HIV than that in monoinfected patients, leading to the increasing rates of cirrhosis and complications 20, 21. The loss of secondary immunity against HCV could provide a possible explanation for the higher persistence rate of HCV in the coinfection patients with HIV, and histologic variants in liver biopsy specimens of coinfected individuals might be due to the direct cytopathic activity of HCV 22. In contrast, Seong\u2010Jun et al conducted EM to observe Huh7 cells harboring HCV full length replicon (JFH1), which revealed prominent clustering of mitochondria in the perinuclear regions within HCV infected cells and a dramatic loss of mitochondrial cristae compared with the uninfected cells 23. Katze et al attempted to gain insight into the mechanisms of HCV\u2010associated cell death by performing microarray experiments on Huh\u20107.5 cells infected with HCV\u2010J6/JFH 24. The presence of activated caspase\u20103 and cell death\u2010related genes both strongly indicated that HCV infection was associated with a direct CPE. A wealth of published literature has referred to some experiments in which one or more HCV proteins could induce cytopathogenicity in cultured hepatocytes. Core protein has been reported to have both pro\u2010 and anti\u2010apoptotic effects on death ligand mediated hepatocyte apoptosis 25, 26. The HCV envelope protein E2 has been found to inhibit TRAIL\u2010induced apoptosis and induce mitochondria\u2010related/caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis in hepatoma cell line 27. Perturbations of apoptotic pathways have also been demonstrated with the nonstructural proteins 28, 29, 30, 31.",
