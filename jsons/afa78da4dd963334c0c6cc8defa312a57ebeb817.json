            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 is a rapidly growing pandemic. As of April 12, 2020, more than 1.8 million people have been affected by the condition worldwide, resulting in over 110,000 deaths [1] . COVID-19 typically presents with fever, cough and dyspnea, although a significant percentage of people might be asymptomatic [7] . Estimates show that approximately 20% of the patients will develop severe symptoms due to pneumonia [6] . While there is no treatment available at the moment, severe cases require hospitalization for management of respiratory symptoms and other serious consequences such as multiple organ failures. The pandemic has caused a severe burden on healthcare systems around the world, leading to a wide range of issues from testing availability to limited hospital and ICU beds [8, 9] . The disease is confirmed by an RT-PCR test, which has a sensitivity as low as 70% [10, 11] and might cause significant delays due to the lack of real-time testing. Recently, the Fleischner Society released recommendations for chest imaging, including CT and X-ray, for COVID-19 [12] . In an environment with constrained resources, such as New York City and parts of Italy, Spain, Iran, and China, it is recommended that chest imaging be used for rapid triage and prioritization of patients in emergency rooms and hospitals. Even in situations with no serious resource constraints, it is recommended that chest imaging is performed for patients suspected of COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms to establish a baseline pulmonary status, perform risk stratification, and verify false negatives. Several studies have shown that features seen on lung CT, namely ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy paving patterns and consolidations, are correlated with disease severity and progression in COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . For each of the tasks of triage, severity assessment and progression tracking, the extent of abnormality must be measured quantitatively. An automated tool that can compute the extent and severity of CT abnormalities is therefore very useful. In this paper, we present an AI system for detection and quantification of abnormalities associated with COVID-19. We also present the unique challenges that arise due to the nature of the COVID-19 emergency and solutions to address each of these challenges.",

In this paper, we propose to inpaint the main patterns of COVID-19, i.e., GGO, consolidations and crazy paving on to CT images from control patients. The data synthesis is trained as a 3D GAN that maps a masked real chest CT image to a chest CT image inpainted with COVID-19 abnormalities: GGO, consolidations and crazy paving patterns. We use randomly deformed 3D meshes and spatial probability map, derived from patients diagnosed with COVID-19, to synthesize the abnormality masks.",

Li et al show that COVID-19 can be differentiated from other types of pneumonia and lung diseases with the help of a CNN-based classifier [14] . While several papers also show varying levels of success in classifying COVID-19 vs controls using deep learning methods [15] [16] [17] , the role of CT imaging in diagnosis and screening remains debatable since a percent of patients who test positive for COVID-19 do not show CT changes. Population studies involving broad testing revealed that out of all patients who tested positive, 46% of the asymptomatic patients [18] , 15% of the patients with mild symptoms and 5% of the patients with severe symptoms show no changes on CT. However, the extent of CT abnormalities, when they are present, are associated with severity and progression [2, 3] .

Many recent studies proposed to use generative networks for either transferring the image modalities [19] [20] [21] [22] or inject synthesize objects [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] to improve the performance of diverse medical imaging related AI applications. It was observed in [24] that only adding the hard synthetic cases into the training set could improve the supervised model performance with a large margin since the majority of the synthetic samples would add little values since they can be successfully recognized by a network that is trained on a large-scale dataset. Thus, authors of [24] use both the discriminator error and the classification error to select only the hard synthetic cases to be added to the augmented dataset. In [31] , authors proposed to synthesize hard samples by drawing latent code from a fully differentiable synthesizer using projected gradient descent. In this work, we use a similar hardcase sampling approach as [24] since the locations of the synthetic tomographic patterns are not yet fully differentiable.",

The amount of standardized and curated CT image data from multiple centers is limited or restricted, the clinical protocols and indications for chest imaging in the disease are evolving as we speak and finally, there is an urgent need for a technological solution to ease the burden on healthcare systems in the middle of a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a solution to these challenges by introducing a framework to synthesize COVID-19 related tomographic patterns in CT images using GAN-based image inpainting and a 3D shape generation algorithm specific to COVID-19 patterns. In our work, we use a single abnormality label to annotate all COVID-19 patterns to train the synthesizer and the abnormality detection networks. Our solution therefore, not only augments data for training of algorithms, it also implicitly learns pneumonia patterns most commonly found in COVID-19, such as GGO, consolidation, and crazy paving pattern.",

We evaluate the impact of adding synthetic data to the lung and abnormality segmentation networks on a benchmark dataset of 100 COVID-19 positive patients and 100 control subjects. We evaluated the improvement in lung segmentation by a new metric called lesion inclusion rate or LIR, which measures the coverage of abnormalities in the lung mask, especially in locations that are common in COVID-19 such as the periphery. We find that addition of synthetic data improved the PIR by 6.02%. Next, we evaluated the improvement of abnormality segmentation with the addition of synthetic data. We see that the DSC of the 2D network improved from 0.623 to 0.645 and the DSC of the 3D network improved from 0.657 to 0.706, which is comparable to the inter-user variability DSC (0.7132 \u00b1 0.1831). Finally, we also report that the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the ground truth and predicted metrics improved with networks using synthetic data. The PCC for the PO improved from 0.908 to 0.939 for the 2D network and 0.933 to 0.961 for the 3D network, which is comparable to the inter-user variability range (P CC = 0.957). Likewise, the PCC for the PHO improved from 0.906 to 0.927 for the 2D network and 0.9099 to 0.9387 for the 3D network. We demonstrate in this paper that the addition of synthetic data improves the quality of lung segmentation by including the regions of high abnormality, which also translates to an improvement in abnormality segmentation.",
