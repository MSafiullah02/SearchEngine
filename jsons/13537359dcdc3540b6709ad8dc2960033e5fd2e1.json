            "text": "Companion rats are often presented to veterinarians for respiratory difficulties. Dyspnea in rats is most commonly due to infectious pneumonia, and thoracic neoplasia can go undiagnosed ante mortem due to a mistaken interpretation of pneumonia. In domestic carnivores, pulmonary nodular patterns have been shown to correlate with lung neoplastic diseases and infectious diseases. The main objective of this retrospective case series study was to determine whether certain radiographic criteria could be correlated with the presence of thoracic infectious disease and neoplastic disease in companion rats. A secondary objective was to determine whether the patient's sex and age were different between rats diagnosed with infectious versus neoplastic disease. Medical records and thoracic radiographs of dyspneic companion rats presented to the University of California at Davis, William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital during the time period from January 2000 to December 2014 were reviewed. Rats with postmortem confirmation of thoracic lesions were included in the study. Thoracic radiographs were evaluated for positioning, lesion distribution, lung lobe involved, pulmonary pattern, mediastinal and pleural lesions by three observers blinded to diagnosis. Thirty rats were included in the study, including 23 rats with an infectious disease and seven with neoplasia. Mediastinal lesions were significantly more prevalent in the group diagnosed with thoracic neoplasia (P = 0.031), in particular cranially (P = 0.048). Although there was an overlap between the two groups, findings indicated that the presence of cranial mediastinal lesions may be helpful for differentiating neoplastic from infectious disease in rats.

            "text": "diseases in companion rats. 1, 2 Pneumonia may be associated with Mycoplasma pulmonis, ciliary associated respiratory bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, the fungus Pneumocystis carinii, sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus, Sendai virus, murine pneumonia virus, and paramyxoviruses among others. 3, 4 Laboratory rats are typically tested for these infectious diseases 5 but systematic testing is not performed in companion rodents 4 and these agents are often present concomitantly and may act synergistically. 2, 6 Thoracic lesions due to infectious agents can lead to dyspnea, which is a common cause of presentation of rats to exotic practitioners. 1, 7 Conversely, spontaneous thoracic neoplasms are rare 7, 8 and may be misdiagnosed. 9 Rats are used as model for carcinogen-induced pulmonary tumors in humans, 10 and the most common primary pulmonary tumors of rats are alveolar adenomas and carcinomas arising from type II pneumocytes 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] and Clara cells. 7 Spontaneous pulmonary hemangiosarcoma 9 and thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma 13 have also been described. Secondary thoracic neoplasms of rats include mesotheliomas, lymphomas, 14,15 histiocytic sarcomas, 3, 16 and metastatic mammary adenocarcinomas among others. 3 Some authors have postulated that thoracic radiographs may be useful for differentiating mycoplasmosis from thoracic neoplasms in companion rats. 1 In dogs, the distribution of lesions among lobes may give an indication of the possible nature of pulmonary neoplasms. 17 In addition, in domestic carnivores, a solitary well-defined pulmonary nodule and multiple circumscribed nodules or masses are considered imaging signs of pulmonary neoplastic diseases. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, a nodular pattern has also been related to infectious diseases. [22] [23] [24] [25] Some textbooks have suggested that radiographic interpretation of rodents may be extrapolated from domestic animals. 26 Rats have two lungs. The right lung is divided into cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lung lobes while the left lung is composed of a single lung lobe. 7, 27 This is different from cats and dogs that have a cranial left lobe, further divided into cranial and caudal parts, and a caudal left lobe. Histologically, rodents display Clara cells in their bronchial epithelium, 7 which are considered precursor cells. 28 Three cell types have been described in the rat alveolar epithelium: type I and type II pneumocytes, and a third cell type specific to rodents, which is considered as a chemoreceptor cell. 29 The rat normal radiographic anatomy has been previously described. 26, 30 To the authors' knowledge, radiographic characteristics of pulmonary lesions have not been described in companion rats; while radiographic techniques 11 and more advanced imaging techniques, such as microcomputed tomography 31 and scintigraphy, 32 have been described in laboratory rats.",

Thirteen female and 10 males were included in the infectious group, two females and five males in the neoplastic group. Sex distribution was not significantly different in both groups (P = 0.25). Median age was 24 months of age, with standard deviation of 10 months (range 6-44). Median age of the rats was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.93) and was 24 months of age for each group (infectious and neoplasia). Histologic diagnosis was infectious pneumonia in 23/30 rats (77%) and neoplastic lesions in 7/30 rats (23%). Among rats diagnosed with mycoplasmosis (8/23; 35%), diagnosis was achieved via postmortem PCR in seven cases. Mycoplasma culture of the lungs was submitted in 15 cases and the result was positive in one case. Four rats had a negative Mycoplasma culture with a concomitant positive Mycoplasma PCR and PCR was not submitted in the single case with a positive Mycoplasma culture result. A Warthin-Starry stain was submitted in eight cases and the result was positive in four cases (4/23; 17%), this was considered indicative of ciliary associated respiratory bacteria. 3 Other pneumonia infectious agents included Streptococcus spp. (4/23; 17%) and C. kutscheri (2/23; 9%), each cultured postmortem from pulmonary lesions. The etiology of the remaining bronchopneumonia cases (5/23; 22%) was not determined. The seven thoracic neoplasms were as follows: lymphoma (5/7; 72%), histiocytic sarcoma (1/7; 14%), and undifferentiated round cell neoplasm (1/7; 14%). Patients included in this study had been either sedated for radiographic positioning, using a combination of midazolam (Midazolam, Novaplus, Irving, TX) and an opioid, or were fully anesthetized with gas anesthesia (Isoflurane, USP, Piramal Healthcare, Bethlehem, PA) when deemed necessary by the clinician. Rats were then restrained with masking tape and foam elements were used as needed to improve positioning. Radiographs were obtained with 50-60 kVp, 5-7.5 mAs, and a small focal spot.

In domestic carnivores, a right lateral view will allow a better visualization of the left hemithorax due to right lung potential atelectesis and the opposite is true for the left lateral view. 38 Similarly, comparing right lateral and left lateral views was beyond the scope of this study and sensitivity of each lateral view for detecting thoracic lesions is likely to vary depending on lesion distribution. There is a bronchial pattern and peribronchial, multiple, mineral opacities with linear shapes are present in the right caudal lung lobe (black arrowheads) which are suspected to be airway associated. The cardiac silhouette (C, asterisk) has a mediastinal shift to the right, indicating atelectasis of the right lung. There is retraction of the right lung from the thoracic wall (C, small arrow) with increased soft tissue opacity caused by pleural effusion. On necropsy, there was pleural effusion and atelectasis with chronic fibrosis of the right lung. Abscesses were present bilaterally (C, curved arrow; D, open arrowhead) that were not well visualized on the radiographs. There was bronchiectasis with luminal obstruction secondary to mucosal proliferation and secretions (D, white arrow) causing the chronic atelectasis of the lung.

Pulmonary vessels were not visible in any of the studied radiographs. Additionally, due to the small size of the thorax, differentiating well-defined and ill-defined nodules was challenging when the spatial resolution did not enable clear visualization of the nodule's margin. Alveolar pattern, changes in the mediastinum and pleural abnormalities were easily identified on rat's radiographs in this study. Unstructured interstitial pattern was not diagnosed in any rat, as it may have been indistinguishable from normal lung due to spatial resolution limitations. In most cases, diffuse pulmonary interstitial opacity was considered as artifactual; therefore the prevalence of changes to the structure of the lungs without nodular or alveolar disease could have been underestimated in the present study. Although the thymus causes a characteristic widening of the cranial mediastinum in rats, 26 a radiographic diagnosis of a cranial mediastinal mass was suggestive of round cell neoplasia in four cases. However, at the individual level, mediastinal lesions could be associated with both thoracic infectious disease and neoplasia. One rat's radiographic diagnosis was in favor of neoplasia but the cranial mediastinal mass was actually diagnosed as a very large abscess on necropsy, while lymphoma was confirmed in the three other rats. Mediastinal lesions were a common feature of thoracic neoplasms in this dataset. This finding can be explained by the majority of cases being affected by round cell neoplasia causing lymphadenopathy. Hence, suspicion of a cranial mediastinal mass should prompt further diagnostic investigations such as thoracic ultrasound or computed tomography.",

Necropsy results were deemed necessary to rigorously assess the significance of the radiographic lesions detected and this limited the sample size. The population of companion rats enrolled in this study may also have been biased as it was collected from a referral center, included dyspneic rats that worsened despite treatment. As a necropsy was available during the following month after radiographs were obtained, it is possible that more advanced cases of respiratory disease were likely selected compared to the general rat population. The time frame between radiograph acquisition and postmortem examination was also a limitation of the study, as thoracic disease could have progressed in the interim. Some rats received antimicrobial treatments between radiograph acquisition and postmortem examination, which could have decreased the extent of their lesions in some cases and could have negated microbiologic cultures. In addition, screening for bacterial agents through microbiologic tests and special stains was not performed for all rats and testing for viral agents was beyond the scope of the study. Finally nonpathogenic Mycoplasma spp. were likely detected via PCR. The PCR used in these rats has a low specificity, as M. pulmonis is regarded as the only clinically significant Mycoplasma in rats 3 but other Mycoplasma species were detected with the primers used in the present study. 33 This could have led to erroneous conclusions regarding the cause of pneumonia in some patients. For this reason, rats with infectious bronchopneumonia were grouped together regardless of the infectious agent detected. Due to the delay between radiographic and postmortem tests, it was also not feasible to compare radiographic and histopathologic lesions in each pulmonary lobes. Patients were therefore considered as a whole entity affected by a disease.",
