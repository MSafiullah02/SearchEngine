Our study concerned only nonhospitalized patients and depicted for the first time the natural prevalence of rotavirus in this area over a long period. diarrheic patients (group I) and 115 healthy donors (group II). Diarrhea was defined when patients had three or more loose stools in 24 hours. Both diarrheic and control groups were composed of subjects living in urban and rural areas. Group I included 156 children under 10 years of age, 12 children between 10 and 15 years, and 43 adults. Group I1 included only children under 10 years of age who had no gastroenteritis or respiratory signs.

As already reported for sub-Saharan Africa [de Mol et al, 1982; Paul and Erinle, 19821 , the highest prevalence of rotavirus occurred during the dryer months. However, in our area of study, temperature and relative humidity (RH) also presented seasonal variation although the amplitudes of variation of these parameters were low. Interestingly, an obvious cyclical variation of RH was observed only when the daily deviations between maximum and minimum RH (ARH) were plotted. It was shown that in vitro low and high extremes of RH could also affect the survival of rotaviruses [Moe and Shirley, 19821 . However, we were unable to determine which of the climatological factors was primarily responsible for the cyclicity of rotavirus gastroenteritis.",
