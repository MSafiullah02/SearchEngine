As polymerases of a number of viruses had been shown to be attractive targets for the development of DAA therapeutics, we embarked on this discovery with the assurance of at least some successful precedent [4]. At the inception of our research, the optimal therapy for HCV patients required extended (48 weeks) co-administration of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), a regime that resulted in only 40\u201350% of genotype 1 patients achieving a sustained viral response (SVR), as defined as the absence of detectable viral RNA in serum 6 months after conclusion of treatment [5]. Additionally, Peg-IFN treatments are associated with severe flu-like side effects, as well as fatigue, drowsiness, and anemia. This leads to significant patient discontinuations despite the severe prognosis of the untreated disease [6]. The necessity to address the substantial unmet medical need with a well-tolerated and effective oral therapy was the compelling impetus for the initiation of our research.",

In this review, the biochemical enzyme assays (for which IC50s are reported) were performed with recombinant wild-type NS5B (genotype 1b, Con1) containing a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 18 amino acids and a resistance variant containing a single amino acid substitution, P495L. The inhibition of the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides in these transcriptional assays was detected using scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads [16]. Compound inhibitory activities were also determined in replicon systems (for which we report EC50s) consisting of human hepatocyte-derived cell lines (Huh-7) that constitutively express sub-genomic HCV RNA (genotypes 1b and 1a, Con1 and H77c, respectively) encoding essential cis-elements and the HCV nonstructural proteins required for RNA replication. Inhibition of viral RNA replication correlates with a decrease in HCV RNA and protein production. Reduction in HCV replication was measured indirectly by monitoring HCV NS3 protease activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay [17\u201319]. The cytotoxicity of compounds in the replicon host cells was determined by measurement of the fluorescence of Alamar blue dye, an indicator of mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.",

            "text": "Considering first compound 1, of the many initiatives undertaken with this chemotype, one of the more productive involved a de-annulation derived from a one-carbon excision from the parent heterocycle [22]. This generated the imidazole-appended acrylate 3 shown in Fig. 2. Encouragingly, this derivative retained a significant activity and prompted the evaluation of a number of isosteric heterocycles. Unfortunately, in the case of 1,3,5-substituted pyrazoles, as exemplified by compound 4, it was disappointing that these proved to be less active than the parent benzimidazole. Interestingly, however, the isomeric derivative 5 was found to be essentially equipotent with the original lead; this was attributed to a reduction in allylic strain in a putative bioactive conformation [22]. In modeling studies, the differences in potencies of many of the heterocycles explored could be most comprehensively rationalized by considering subtle variations in the vectors defined by the distances between the cyclohexyl moiety and the acid functionalities of the various analogs tested. It was known that the cyclohexyl group appeared to function as an anchor, binding the ligand to NS5B; variations in the distances between this functionality and the acid moieties were projected to modulate key binding interactions between each of the ligands\u2019 carboxylate moieties and Arg503 of NS5B, and this concept could rationalize much of the potency variations observed with the analogs explored.\n",

In some variants of this basic concept, additional polarity was introduced into the system through the incorporation of heteroatoms and polar linking moieties within the bridging groups themselves. To explore these concepts, the simple 6-carboxylate derivatives were examined first as these would lead to lower molecular weight, non-amidic analogs.

The optimized dihedral angles between the pendent phenyl and the indole cores did not appear to be key determinants of activity since equipotent derivatives with inclinations between these moieties of between 43\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 were observed. This suggested that the preferred bioactive conformations could be easily accessed in all of the ring systems explored. None of the indolo-fused heterocyles are rigid, and, correspondingly, any entropic factors positively contributing to binding may be quite modest. This, in conjunction with the observation that the introduction of polarity into various positions on the bridging elements was not only tolerated, but could be associated with further improvements in activity, as seen in analogs 12 through 16, was supportive of the interpretation of productive interactions between the tethering elements and the protein. Furthermore, the significant enhancement of activity noted in compounds 14 and 15 gave an early insight into the possibility of further incorporation of amidic motifs at this position on the chemotype, vide infra.",

The amidic N-H moiety of the proximal carboxamide forms a hydrogen bond with ARG 503, and the terminal carboxylate forms a salt bridge with R498. The fused, formerly pendent phenyl group lies in a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of NS5B and is inclined at an angle of ~46\u00b0 relative to the indole ring. This is similar to that observed in the minimized structure of the indolobenzazepinones 14 and 15 and in these specific analogs doubtless contributes to their potency. It should be noted that in the above structure and in others that were obtained, the \u03941 finger domain of the enzyme could not be resolved due to disorder in this region of the peptide.

The alternate (+)-enantiomer 36 could be utilized in the generation of the antipodes, and these consistently exhibited a three- to fivefold loss of inhibitory activity relative to their related enantiomers. The assignment of the absolute stereochemistry in the cyclopropyl-fused analogs was determined based on data obtained from an X-ray co-crystal structure of compound 66 (vide infra) bound to NS5B, data that also supported the idea of productive interactions between the hydrogen atoms of the cyclopropyl motif and NS5B.",

Contrastingly, the cyclopropyl antipodes 40 and 42 were essentially equipotent with the related indolobenzazepines. Importantly, these observations confirmed a working hypothesis that the introduction of the cyclopropane modification with the correct stereochemistry might be associated with some enhancement in activity. This was predicated on modeling studies in which potential binding modes of 42 and 43 in Site I of the thumb domain of NS5B were compared, as shown in Fig. 14 [38]. In these models, both enantiomers are presented in what is calculated to be optimized conformations, and both compounds exhibit a number of redundant interactions with the enzyme. However, relative to 42, the antipode 43 participates in additional productive contacts, most notably between elements in the morpholine moiety and the side-chain methyl group of residue T399, as well as interaction between the polarized methylene hydrogen atoms in the cyclopropyl group and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of L492. Furthermore, the carbonyl oxygen of the acylsulfamide in 43 is better positioned for optimal H-bonding with R503. This is in contrast to what is predicted with 42, where steric impediments between the morpholine ring and the acylsulfamide reduce the latter\u2019s engagement with R503. Additionally, the disposition of the cyclopropyl moiety in 42 prevented contact of its methylene hydrogens with the carbonyl oxygen of L492. Although not apparent from these static models, it was considered reasonable to assume that the cyclopropyl moiety introduced a degree of conformational constraint within the indolobenzazepine ring system and that this might also contribute to the stabilization of the bound conformation shown in Fig. 14b.\n",

Antiviral activity was observed in all dose groups, with those patients receiving the 300 mg dose exhibiting an approximately 2.5 log10 IU/mL decline in viral load measured 24 h post-dosing. Single doses of 66 exhibited dose-related increases in exposure, demonstrated rapid and exposure-related antiviral activity, and were well tolerated. The established pharmacokinetic profiles were supportive of once- or twice-daily dosing.",
