The recent use of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) as an agent of bioterrorism in the United States has also helped in accelerating the national interest in vaccine development [1], [2]. While the discovery of protective antigens remains a critical tool in vaccine development, research efforts on the design and testing of different delivery mechanisms, vaccine formulations, and overall efficacy are also needed. In studying these aspects of vaccine development, it has become increasingly clear that, while the induction of humoral immunity via parenteral administration is in some cases sufficient for protection, the best route of vaccine administration is via mucosal surfaces, especially for protection against organisms that use these surfaces as sites of entry. Efficient delivery is a concern with this approach; however, studies utilizing genetically engineered attenuated pathogenic bacteria or viruses as vaccine carriers have shown promise in a multitude of different infection and tumor models [3], [4], [5]. Although these carriers have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, administration to humans has been limited because of safety concerns ranging from the generation of adverse inflammatory responses, the threat of reversion to a pathogenic state as a result of horizontal gene transfer, and in causing cancer as has been demonstrated in the case of viral vectors [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].",

            "text": "One potential strategy for the development of a non-living, non-attenuated vaccine carrier is the use of bacterial minicells. Bacterial minicells are small, non-dividing, achromosomal (100\u2013400 nm) vesicles that are produced by most bacterial species as a result of premature septation. Studies focusing on the properties of E. coli minicells have shown that minicells can be engineered to package plasmid DNA, recombinant proteins, or both [11], [12], [13]. On a biochemical level, minicells have been shown to be metabolically active in that they can actively transport metabolites, transcribe and translate plasmid encoded gene products, and are subject to infection by bacteriophage [14], [15], [16], [17]. In addition, minicells contain the same structural protein and lipid constituents of parental cells including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and an intact peptidoglycan layer. These surface components are quickly recognized by antigen presenting cells (APC) as pathogen associated molecular patterns through Toll-like and other receptors expressed by these cells [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. The interaction between LPS and TLR4, in particular, helps to stimulate the inflammatory response necessary to generate an immune response as well as promoting the uptake and processing of bacteria [23]. Minicells retain these abilities of parental bacterial cells.",

Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a general antigen and monitoring antibody production in the sera as well as the mucosa, the best minicell formulation tested contained both recombinantly expressed antigen as well as plasmid DNA encoding the antigen under eukaryotic control. This delivery combination was able to induce high levels of IgG in the sera after introduction by several different routes, including intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), and oral (p.o.) administration. Taken together, these results suggest that with more development, minicells could be suitable as a safe and effective vaccine delivery vehicle.",

Sera harvested from these mice at day 21 revealed that GFP-specific IgG antibodies were detectable following the single dose (Fig. 2b), although the titers observed were not identical to what was observed with a triple dose immunization schedule. In these experiments, DNA alone, either naked or encapsulated by minicells, was more efficient than in those shown in Fig. 2a. Nevertheless, minicells that contained both heterologous GFP protein antigen and the plasmid encoding this antigen induced a significant (2.5-fold, p\n < 0.05) increase in GFP-specific antibody over titers produced by naked plasmid DNA alone. Minicells containing protein or DNA alone were not as efficient at inducing a humoral immune response as those providing both, supporting the hypothesis that the ability of minicells to simultaneously deliver both DNA and protein may be beneficial in the development of vaccines for clinical use. These studies shown in Fig. 2 also indicate that multiple doses delivered i.m. may result in a significant increase in titer over that observed for a single dose when minicells deliver both DNA and protein as opposed to when either alone is used.",

Robust IgG responses were recorded following a single i.m. injection and could be increased somewhat by utilizing a three dose regimen. Few adverse effects (inflammation or infection) were observed at the site of injection in any of the mice immunized i.m. suggesting that the mice were able to tolerate the amount of LPS present on the surface of the minicells. It was also found that minicells delivering both heterologous protein and the DNA encoding the antigen under eukaryotic control could induce antigen-specific IgG antibody responses in the sera and low but detectable GFP-specific IgA in mucosal lavage fluids after a three dose regimen was administered by either the i.n. or p.o. routes.

There are several potential advantages of using minicells derived from commensal E. coli strains of bacteria in fitting this unmet need. Minicells derived from commensal bacteria are likely to be better tolerated than heat-killed vaccines derived from pathogenic bacteria, potentially reducing adverse inflammatory immune responses. Beyond these and other safety advantages, another potential advantage stems from the versatile nature of the minicell carrier for implementation of different \u201cprime-boost\u201d strategies using different vaccine modalities. The sequential delivery of genetic vaccines and protein antigens has been shown to be more effective in inducing humoral responses in humans than genetic vaccines alone [33], [34], [35], [36] and can be well facilitated by the minicell delivery system. This strategy has proven effective using poliovirus replicons, attenuated Salmonella enterica sv Typhi Ty21a, and in several other genetic immunization protocols [33], [34], [36], [37], [38]. In all cases, the immune system was primed with the genetic vaccine and then boosted with the corresponding recombinant antigen.",

As such, minicells derived from these strains have the ability to survive the hostile environment of the gastrointestinal tract, making them an attractive candidate for mucosal delivery. On the other hand, using minicells derived from commensal bacteria may be disadvantageous because pre-existing natural mucosal tolerance has been built to the minicell vector as a result of the exposure of the immune system to commensal bacterial antigens. As with any vaccine platform, the adjuvant properties of the vehicle may be important in generating an immune response and enhanced immunogenecity, i.e. \u201cforeignness\u201d, may be required for efficient vaccine delivery. However, the immunogenicity of the vehicle may also prevent subsequent use of the same vehicle to deliver a different vaccine if memory responses to the vehicle have been raised in the first immunization, as has been shown in cases where Salmonella sp. have been used as carriers [39], [40]. More testing will be required to fully evaluate the ability of commensal E. coli minicells to effectively deliver antigens and DNA using mucosal routes of administration. At the same time, mucosal immunity is not understood nearly as well as humoral immunity especially with respect to the development of immunological memory [41], [42], [43]. As more information becomes available on the mechanisms and requirements for the establishment of immunological memory in the mucosa, the improvements needed to enhance efficacy of minicells as vaccine carriers will be better understood.",

            "text": "While the data shown here directly demonstrate that minicells can induce immune responses after delivery of both heterologous protein antigen and the DNA encoding that antigen, many questions remain. For example, the studies shown here strongly suggest that multiple immunizations are superior when minicells deliver both DNA and protein. This may be because the DNA component primes the animal to respond to subsequent exposure to protein and vice versa. On the other hand, a single dose administration of naked DNA alone or of minicells containing only plasmid DNA gave higher specific antibody titers compared to those of mice immunized three times (see Fig. 2b). It is possible that this is due to the timing of the testing (21 days for single administration versus 35 days for 3 immunizations), but further experimentation is required to determine if this is the case. Either way, these results suggest that a boost is not necessarily effective in increasing antigen specific serum IgG levels when naked DNA or minicells encapsulating DNA are used. This may be due to the effects of vector priming as has been shown for certain Salmonella serovars used to deliver vaccines [39]. In those studies, it was shown that a previous exposure to the relevant Salmonella carrier resulted in dramatic decreases in immune responses to antigens delivered at a later time by the same carrier. The results shown in Fig. 2 also suggest that using minicells to deliver only soluble protein antigens is largely ineffective. This may be because soluble GFP protein is only mildly immunogenic and is located on the interior of minicells. Exchanging GFP for a more immunogenic cytosolic antigen like LT-B or expressing protein antigens on the surface of minicells may help in increasing antibody titers [44]. Future studies utilizing a more biologically relevant antigen are required to elucidate the mechanisms behind these results in addition to determining the ability to protect as well as the longevity and isotype profiles of any antibody responses.",

(b) GFP-specific IgA antibodies detected in the nasal wash of immunized mice (i.n. administration only) at day 35. (c) GFP-specific IgA antibodies detected in the intestinal lavage fluid of immunized mice (p.o. administration only) at day 35. Serum IgG titers an relative IgA levels were calculated as described in Section 2. *p < 0.05 compared against na\u00efve group. \u2020p < 0.05 compared against all groups tested.",
