According to a 2003 WHO report, the first official report of an outbreak of peculiar pneumonia within the province had affected 305 people and caused five deaths. Around 30% of cases have been suggested to occur among health care employees who were involved in patient care. More than one-third of the early cases have been noted in food handlers (individuals who manage, kill, and sell animal origin food, or those who prepare and serve food). The previous incidence of the SARS-CoV outbreak, which started in China in the year 2002 and lasted until July 2003, had spread across the world, affecting 24 countries that included Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Hanoi, Canada, and others, recording 8,437 SARS cases and 813 deaths [8-10].",

The replicase gene encoding the nonstructural proteins occupy two-thirds of the genome, approximately 20 kb, instead of the structural and accent proteins, which make up only approximately 10 kb of the viral genome. The 5\u2032 end of the genome includes a leader series and untranslated region (UTR) that consists of multiple stem-loop systems required for RNA replication and transcription. Moreover, at the start of every structural or accent gene, there are transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) that might be required for the expression of each of those genes. The 3\u2032 UTR additionally consists of RNA structures required for replication and synthesis of viral RNA. The organization of the CoV genome is 5\u2032-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)-E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3\u2032 UTR-poly (A) tail with accessory genes interspersed in the structural genes on the 3\u2032 end of the genome. The accent proteins are nearly completely non-essential for the replication in tissue cultures, but some have been proven to play a crucial role in viral pathogenesis [5,21].",

Recent research showed that SARS-CoV can live up to two weeks after drying and five days at temperatures of 22-25\u00b0C and 40-50% relative humidity, with a gradual decline in the viability of the virus thereafter. The viability of SARS-CoV was found to decrease after 24 hours at 38\u00b0C and 80-90% relative humidity [31]. The virus may remain viable on distinct surfaces for 48 hours at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, even though viability reduced to 8 hours at 30\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity conditions [3,32].

Patients obtained treatment with a corticosteroid (40-80 mg/day) and gamma globulin (15-20 g/day) for three to five days while their resting respiratory rate became greater than 30 per minute, or oxygen saturation was under 93% without oxygen, or multiple pulmonary lobes showed more than 50% progression of sickness in 48 hours on imaging. Patients additionally may be treated with probiotics to relieve gastrointestinal illness. Quinolones and higher generation cephalosporins (oral and intravenous) can be administered if fever lasted for more than seven days or C-reactive protein levels were 30 mg/L or more (normal range: 0-8 mg/L). After the course of treatment, the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be discharged from the hospital only after two negative results of the samples collected with 24-hour interval using an RT-PCR [13]. Other drugs like chloroquine (anti-malaria drug), hydroxychloroquine (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus), azithromycin (anti-bacterial drug), and favipiravir are all either drugs recommended for other causes (repurposed) or drugs that are under clinical trials to treat serious infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nProtease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) in combination with ribavirin may be used for anti-viral therapy in the early phase, and nelfinavir was found to be a promising alternative. The role of interferon and systemic corticosteroid therapy in preventing immune-mediated lung injury requires further investigation. Besides, other anti-viral treatments, RNA interference, monoclonal antibody, synthetic peptides, and vaccines are being developed [42]. Corticosteroids can be used to limit excessive lung damage due to an inflammatory response, and a high flow of oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation can be used in cases of respiratory failure [41]. Tracheostomy may be performed in patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation and longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Strict adherence to infection control guidelines is mandatory while performing tracheostomy in the ICU or operating rooms, as well as during subsequent changes of the tracheostomy tube. Care should be taken during the treatment procedures to reduce complications and the chances of transmission [30]. The use of high-dose pulse methylprednisolone during the clinical course of a SARS outbreak was associated with clinical improvement, but randomized controlled trials are needed to ascertain its efficacy [49].",
