Existing studies have found correlations between search data and HIV/AIDS epidemics. We aimed to extend the literature through exploring the feasibility of using search data to monitor and predict the number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea in China.

In addition, due to the secular stigma and discrimination against STDs, people at risk of infection tend to search for testing services, while infected people tend to seek treatment and care services on the internet as an initial step, 6 instead of attending healthcare facilities. This makes it difficult for health authorities to monitor true HIV/STDs epidemics. There is a possibility that more people's information can be covered like undiagnosed people as a supplement by following the tendency of relevant statistics based on the internet. In the context of big data, attempts have been made to use internet-based information to provide early predictions of diseases, such as Google, 7 Twitter 8 and Baidu. 9 Compared with traditional surveillance systems, this novel approach is more economical, simpler and timely. 10 It has been proven that various infectious diseases, including influenza, 11-14 dengue 15-18 and H7N9, 19 can be effectively monitored and predicted by models using internet data. The sensitivity and specificity of search engine databased monitoring or predicted results is on par with that of the traditional surveillance system. 11 20 It is invaluable to extend this innovative method to other diseases, including HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea that lead to significant morbidity, mortality, clinical outcomes, and with no existing vaccines. 21 Google search data have already been applied in the monitoring and predicting of new diagnoses of HIV infection in USA at state level. 22 23 In China there are also articles using Baidu search data to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS. [24] [25] [26] These studies made an inspiration for adopting more attempts, such as multivariate time series analysis, to explore more effective predictions. Baidu holds the highest search engine market penetration rate in China (93.1% in December 2015) with 94.6% of the total 566 million search engine users searching for information while using it. 27 It is currently the most representative tool for measuring users' behaviours in the country.",

It could involve more than one variable and explain past and causal relationships among multiple variables over time, as well as predict future observations. 28 The structure is that each variable is a linear function of its own past lags and the past lags of the other variables. The incidence of diseases/infections and search data were usually autocorrelated itself and cross-correlated with the other. By evaluating the time lags, the final VAR model would include real incidence data and internet search data which have the potential to make the predictions more stable. However, there has been no studies using VAR model to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea. We aimed to use Baidu search data in combination with previously diagnosed cases through a VAR model to monitor and predict newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea, and compare the different incidence-search patterns.",

Then, the Engle-Granger method was used to test for co-integration because the NDC and composite search index data were all nonstationary. Testing for cointegration identified stable, long-run relationships between sets of variables. The Engle-Granger test was a two-step residual-based testing procedure on regression techniques which first estimating the long-run equation and then the error correction model. The result showed that these two variables were cointegrated.",

As shown in figure 1 , the diagram of the number of newly diagnosed cases and search trend of these three HIV/STDs were annual periodicity and the search trend showed overall upward Open access trend for HIV/AIDS and syphilis. Studies that used search data to predict newly diagnosed cases in China owed this phenomenon as health institutions increase their HIV prevention efforts and resources to make people aware of the risks. 25 The uptrend of syphilis showed the efforts and resources from government or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) may also have influence on people's awareness of other important STDs like syphilis. The trend of monthly composite search index was basically consistent with the number of newly diagnosed cases for the three HIV/STDs",

The coefficients of trend terms were all positive, which illustrated an overall uptrend of the number of newly diagnosed cases for three infections/diseases during 2011-2017. In a cycle of full year, the trend of all newly diagnosed cases showed cyclical change. All infections/diseases started to rise at the beginning of the year and decline at different rates by January next year. In addition, the peak value of HIV/AIDS occurred each December may be attributed to the free testing services on World AIDS Day. Figure 2 showed the VAR models fitted well with the real data and the prediction could catch the periodicity and uptrend character especially for HIV/AIDS and gonorrhoea. The RMSE was 1227.22 for HIV/AIDS, 4929.44 for syphilis and 1342.30 for gonorrhoea. The MAPE was 9.39% for HIV/AIDS, 10.11% for syphilis and 9.35% for gonorrhoea.

Besides, the number of newly diagnosed cases of infectious diseases were autocorrelated and using multivariate model could explain the relationship by selecting an appropriate lag length. Figure 2 depicted there were seasonal periodicity for all three HIV/STD, dropping abruptly from January to February, which may attribute to the testing intention reduction of people during the Spring Festival, then going up from February and tending to be stable after several waves in December except for the cases of HIV/ AIDS, it possibly due to test promotion activities during World AIDS Day. Compared with syphilis, HIV/AIDS and gonorrhoea models have a longer correlation between the number of newly diagnosed cases and search data. It shall be noted that because the uptrend was more stable, the prediction curve fitted well for HIV/AIDS. As shown in figure 2 , there was a rise of incidence in 2017 for syphilis and gonorrhoea, which was different from past years, making the prediction curve lower than true incidence curve. This may be caused by government's effort on publicity of health education and people's attention to syphilis and gonorrhoea testing which were more likely to be deficient than HIV/AIDS in previous years.",
