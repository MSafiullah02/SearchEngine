HCoV\u2010OC43 (OC43) and HCoV\u2010229E (229E) were the first documented human CoVs but, more recently, HCoV\u2010NL63 (NL63) 4 and HCoV\u2010HKU1 (HKU1) 5 were identified as a consequence of increased viral surveillance efforts in the early twenty\u2010first century (Table 1). These four viruses usually cause acute infection of the upper respiratory tract and less frequently are associated with lower respiratory tract 6, 7 diseases as well. Severe disease is both rare and typically associated with co\u2010morbidities and/or immunosenescence. The past 15 years have also seen the emergence of two new human coronaviruses that cause significant disease and mortality. SARS\u2010CoV was identified in 2003 and caused an acute, atypical pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in roughly 8000 patients 8, 9. Those over 65 years of age often developed ARDS, resulting in mortality rates that exceeded 50%. Overall, SARS\u2010CoV infection caused nearly 800 fatalities, representing a nearly 10% mortality rate. More recently, in 2012, a new human coronavirus, designated MERS\u2010CoV, was identified. MERS\u2010CoV continues to circulate in camels and humans, with over 857 official cases and 334 deaths, representing an approximately 35% case fatality rate to date in humans 10, 11. MERS\u2010CoV\u2010induced disease is particularly severe in aged patients and those with pre\u2010existing co\u2010morbidities. MERS\u2010CoV does not appear to be highly pathogenic or virulent in camels.",

Numerous models have been established to better enable our understanding of the mechanics of SARS\u2010CoV infection and pathogenesis, although few recapitulate the human disease phenotypes (Table 2). Initial studies utilized late epidemic strains in non\u2010human primates 31, 32, 33, where mild to severe disease was observed, depending on the study location and animal age. To date, the differences in disease severity noted in primates have not been reconciled, but may reflect differences in virus strains or infection conditions. Although still under development, MERS\u2010CoV replication and disease have been reported in both rhesus macaques and common marmosets 34, 35. SARS\u2010CoV replication resulted in limited disease in young models of immunocompetent mice 36, 37, 38; however, mild clinical disease was noted in 1 year\u2010old mice 39. A mouse\u2010adapted SARS (MA\u2010SARS) strain was also developed that provides a model for moderate to lethal disease, depending on infectious dose, animal age and genetic background of the host 40, 41, 42 (Table 2). The MA\u2010SARS model faithfully replicates the age\u2010dependent susceptibility observed in human patients, as well as key features of human lung pathology, including virus tropism to airway epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, pneumonia, hyaline membrane formation, development of DAD and denudation of airway epithelial cells 40, 43. A limitation may be the rapid clearance of virus titres that is seen in younger and, to a much lesser extent, in aged animals. Development of the MA\u2010SARS model has allowed for in\u2010depth studies of viral pathogenesis and the host immune response, taking advantage of immunological tools and reagents for the mouse as well as the existence of knockout mouse strains. Use of these tools has greatly added to our understanding of SARS\u2010CoV pathogenesis, far beyond what could be learned in in vitro experiments or observational studies of human cases. Because of receptor incompatibilities, MERS\u2010CoV does not replicate in mice unless the animals are first transduced with adenovirus vectors encoding the receptor for entry, human dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4) 44.",

As compared with influenza A viruses, ISG transcripts and proteins are not induced until late after SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infection, when peak titres have already occurred in culture (\u223c18\u201324 h). Late in infection, ISGs showed nearly universally increased expression following SARS\u2010CoV infection, except for ACE2 and Serping1. However, a much larger subset of ISGs had significantly decreased expression following MERS\u2010CoV infection. Like MERS\u2010CoV, H5N1 VN1203 infection also resulted in significant down\u2010regulation of subsets of ISGs. No consistent pattern in up\u2010regulation or down\u2010regulation of gene expression correlated with transcription factor usage, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be responsible for expression of the ISG subsets. Cells infected with MERS\u2010CoV and H5N1 avian influenza were shown to have specifically altered open and closed chromatin structures, potentially limiting the ability of transcription factors to access and bind certain ISG promoter regions. The mechanism by which MERS\u2010CoV induces this chromatin structural alteration is as yet unknown. In contrast, the NS1 protein of H5N1 was responsible for the chromatin changes in influenza\u2010infected cells.

MDA5 and IFIT1 are important host antiviral sensor or antiviral defence ISGs that detect viral RNAs. IFIT1 recognizes unmethylated 2\u2032\u2010O RNA 66 and alters efficient translation/stability of uncapped viral mRNAs 67.

SARS\u2010CoV is much more sensitive to interferon treatment in the absence of functional nsp16 methyltransferase activity, and mutant viral titres drop rapidly in both infected epithelial cells and mice. Deletion or knockdown of either MDA5 or IFIT1 restored mutant SARS\u2010CoV viral loads demonstrated the essential role of these host proteins in detecting pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns.

The SARS\u2010CoV accessory protein ORF6 was identified as an interferon antagonist important for viral replication in low multiplicity of infection (MOI) in vitro infections 71, 72. ORF6 was subsequently found to sequester Karyopherin 2\u03b1, a nuclear import factor, and block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 after SARS\u2010CoV infection. Interestingly, STAT1 translocation to the nucleus is not blocked in MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells, so it remains uncertain whether antagonists of nuclear import are encoded in the viral genome 73. Transcriptional profiling of SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected macaques revealed robust IFN signalling, including STAT1 translocation to the nucleus, in the lung but not in the cells that stained positive for viral antigen 74.

These knockouts were first tested for SARS\u2010CoV susceptibility using the Tor2 strain in a sublethal model; animals deficient in STAT1 were unable to clear virus from the lung and developed a more severe and longer\u2010lasting pneumonia than the control mice 76. Frieman et al showed that STAT1 knockout mice are highly susceptible to infection with MA\u2010SARS in a novel, IFN\u2010independent mechanism 56. MA\u2010SARS\u2010infection causes massive inflammatory cell influx in the lungs of STAT1 knockout mice, including large numbers of macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils. STAT1 knockout mice have gross pathological changes in their lungs, including massive haemorrhage as well as increased lung size and stiffness. As seen in some humans, these mice develop severe pulmonary fibrosis and succumb to disease at late time points after infection. Stained lung sections revealed the presence of collagen protein in alveolar exudates in STAT1 knockouts, indicating development of early\u2010stage pulmonary fibrosis. Subsequent studies demonstrated that STAT1 knockout animals developed a Th2\u2010skewed immune response and had significant numbers of alternatively activated or M2 macrophages in their lungs 77. These macrophages were characterized by positive CD11c, arginase and mannose receptor staining. STAT6 is required for the development of alternatively activated macrophages, and STAT1/STAT6 double knockout mice do not develop the severe lung disease and pro\u2010fibrotic lesions observed in the STAT1 single knockout 78, thus demonstrating that these macrophages are essential for development of the pulmonary fibrosis phenotype. Further elegant experiments showed that it is the STAT1 deficiency in monocyte/macrophage cells, not the infected epithelial cells, that drives alternatively activated macrophage production and induction of fibrotic lung disease following SARS\u2010CoV infection. Alternatively activated macrophages are typically induced by the Th2 cytokines IL\u20104 and IL\u201013; they have an anti\u2010inflammatory role and play an important role in wound\u2010healing processes 151.",

ARDS patients exhibit decreased surfactant levels 95 and MA\u2010SARS infection results in decreased surfactant transcript and protein levels 43. Decreased surfactant, and the consequent increase in surface tension, reduces the ability of the lung to expand and contract during normal respiration; it also heightens the risk of lung collapse during expiration. Respiratory dysfunction occurs when the alveolar membranes are obstructed, or when the ability of the lung to expand and contract, circulating oxygenated air, is compromised. Lethal SARS\u2010CoV infection in the mouse and human is characterized by a breakdown of alveolar membrane integrity, resulting in accumulation of fluid exudates in the alveolar spaces. Virus infection also results in an overwhelming cytokine response, severe lung tissue damage and respiratory failure 96, 97, 98, 99. The progression from initial disease to diffuse alveolar damage and the exudative and organizing stage of DAD is often independent of high\u2010titre viral replication 24, indicating that this severe disease outcome is primarily driven by an immunopathological response, including inflammatory cell recruitment and viral damage to type II pneumocytes. This conclusion is further supported by non\u2010human primate and mouse models of SARS\u2010CoV infection, where lethal disease is more often associated with severe pulmonary lesions, alveolar exudates and respiratory dysfunction than with high viral load 43, 100. MA\u2010SARS infection results in peak viral titres at 1\u20132 days post\u2010infection, along with airway denudation and resulting debris, which can occlude the small airways.

Pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL\u20106, TNF\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and CCL2 57, recruit inflammatory cells to the site of infection. Neutrophils and cytotoxic T cells, along with these cytokines, can induce tissue damage, including vascular leakage, and stimulate pulmonary fibrosis 101. Pro\u2010fibrotic genes, including Tgf\u03b21, Ctgf and Pdgfa and numerous collagen transcripts, have increased expression following MA\u2010SARS infection. Fluid exudates, haemorrhage and fibrin are all observed in the alveolar spaces of SARS patients, as well as in animal models of disease 17, 43, 102, increasing in severity as a function of age. In response, the coagulation cascade is activated, including increased factor 10 (FX), F2, F3 (tissue factor), F11, F12 and F7 transcript levels. Activation of the coagulation cascade results in F10 cleavage of prothrombin into thrombin and subsequent thrombin cleavage of fibrinogen into fibrin 103. Fibrin clots in the alveoli are a prominent feature of SARS\u2010CoV infection in humans and mice. The goal of this coagulation response is likely to protect the host by sealing the alveoli, preventing alveolar flooding and haemorrhage, which limit oxygen exchange and endanger patient survival. Collagen expression is also increased following SARS\u2010CoV infection 43. Collagen accumulation, fibrin and fibrin clots all contribute to a developing fibrotic lung state, while at the same time stimulating the infected host to up\u2010regulate fibrinolytic pathways 92.",

            "text": "Profibrinolytic genes include members of the urokinase pathway, such as urokinase (plau), tPA and plasmin (plg) 104. The urokinase signalling pathway leads to cleavage and activation of plasmin into plasminogen; this protease then cleaves fibrin clots. Serpine1 and Serpine2 are negative regulators of urokinase pathway and inhibit urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. Urokinase signalling is highly active in the absence of Serpine1, and this imbalance often results in haemorrhage in knockout mice. Serpine1 is highly expressed in SARS patients, non\u2010human primates and small animal models 43, 74, 105. ARDS studies, independent of coronavirus infection, have attributed this Serpine1 expression to alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes 106, 107. MA\u2010SARS infection in a Serpine1 knockout mouse model results in lethal disease with extreme lung pathology 43. Conversely, MA\u2010SARS\u2010infected mice with a genetic deficiency in tPA have increased exudates in the lung. The dysregulation of these coagulation/anti\u2010coagulation cascades can result in worsening end\u2010stage lung disease conditions, resulting in death.",

SARS\u2010CoV infection causes massive tissue remodelling through urokinase and coagulation pathways activity, as discussed above. Other important wound\u2010healing pathways and ECM proteins with altered signalling following SARS\u2010CoV infection include matrix metalloproteinases, EGFR and collagens 43. Successful recovery from ALI requires a delicate balance of pro\u2010inflammatory, profibrotic and profibrinolytic responses. By altering ISG expression, including ACE2, STAT1 and Serpine1, SARS\u2010CoV infection of alveolar epithelial cells sets the stage for the development of severe lung disease, including ARDS.",

Small animal models of severe lung disease typically lack physiological readouts of respiratory function that can be directly correlated back to human signs of disease. Whole\u2010body plethysmography captures respiratory data in unrestrained animals, allowing for longitudinal measurement of pulmonary function; these data can also be directly related to some human respiratory metrics 110, 111. SARS\u2010CoV infection causes increased Penh, a calculated measure of airway resistance and increased EF50 (mid\u2010breath exhalation force), indicating that respiratory function is compromised and animals must do more work to breathe 69. Unpublished data (Gralinski and Menachery) indicate that it is the exhalation portion of each breath that is impacted by SARS\u2010CoV infection, likely due to extensive debris clogging the conducting airways. Further experiments have shown that Stat1 knockout mice have increased Penh levels early after infection, and that at late timepoints they have reduced lung capacity, corresponding with the profibrotic histopathological changes observed in the lung (Gralinski, unpublished data).",

Several highly pathogenic emerging virus infections cause ARDS with high frequency, underscoring the critical public health importance of understanding the virological components and molecular mechanisms that drive this devastating end\u2010stage lung disease. Furthermore, a portion of ARDS cases may progress to pulmonary fibrosis, another clinically devastating end\u2010stage lung disease with few treatment options. Consequently, understanding the development of ARDS following viral infection remains a high\u2010priority research topic that is germane to global health and pandemic disease control. The twenty\u2010first century has demonstrated that zoonotic events will continue to introduce coronaviruses and other viruses into the human population, and that these viruses have the potential to spread rapidly, cause significant disease in communities and disrupt the global economy. An emerging theme is the connectivity between virus infection, complement and coagulation cascade activation, pro\u2010inflammatory and profibrotic cytokine responses and disease severity. More studies are needed to unravel the complex interactions between these pathways that can interact to promote or dysregulate wound recovery after life\u2010threatening respiratory virus infection. In particular there is a need for including well\u2010articulated animal models that faithfully recapitulate disease processes across species. Only through a better understanding of the interplay between a dysregulated host immune response and ALI and ARDS can more effective treatments and therapeutics be developed.",
