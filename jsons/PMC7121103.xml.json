            "text": "Diagnostic virology is the process in which the viral etiologic cause of infection is identified from a patient\u2019s clinical sample. In the past, diagnostic virology relied on three classical techniques to make this diagnosis of viral infection: (a) virus isolation by direct virus cultivation, (b) viral antigen detection, and (c) indirect detection of virus-specific antibodies. While the remaining important tools are utilized by diagnostic virology laboratories today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific reagents/methods such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, or purified antigens. In the past several decades, the number of new molecular-based methods increased rapidly and became widely used in diagnostic virology laboratories. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in [1]). The majority of these nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speedy, sensitive, and specific and thus meet the gold \u201cfour-S standard\u201d for their application in any diagnostic laboratory. The methods are simple and speedy because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are required by the laboratory, and identification of a viral pathogen takes only a few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patient\u2019s clinical specimen to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and can even identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time. In this chapter, we will focus on detection of viral RNA splicing as a new tool for diagnostic virology.",

            "text": "RNA splicing was discovered 40 years ago by Susan Berget [2] and Louise Chow [3]; these investigators mapped adenovirus transcription and identified intervening sequences (introns) in type 2 adenovirus primary transcripts. Subsequently, RNA splicing was recognized as an essential nuclear event for mammalian gene expression and for virus replication of almost all DNA viruses and some RNA viruses. Most mammalian genes consist of multiple segments called exons which are separated by noncoding or intervening sequences named introns. Genes which are composed of exons and introns are \u201csplit\u201d genes. After transcription, a nascent or primary transcript (pre-mRNA) contains both exons and introns. The introns are removed from the pre-mRNA by a molecular process called \u201cRNA splicing\u201d resulting in production of spliced mature mRNA. RNA splicing takes place both in coding as well as in noncoding primary transcripts. RNA splicing has been considered a posttranscriptional event; however, recent studies have demonstrated that RNA splicing often occurs co-transcriptionally [4, 5]. Only those transcripts which are fully processed are eventually exportable from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.",

These cis-elements allow cellular splicing machinery to recognize and remove the intron from pre-mRNA. Most mammalian introns start with GU dinucleotide on its 5\u2019 end and an AG dinucleotide on its 3\u2019 end (\u201cGU-AG\u201d introns). The GU-AG pairs are conserved sequences and define the exon-intron boundaries. Introns with an AU on its 5\u2019 end and an AC on its 3\u2019 end are rare, and this set of the introns are known as \u201cAU-AC\u201d introns [6, 7]. The presence of splice sites is not sufficient for intron definition. All introns must contain an additional element called a \u201cbranch point,\u201d which is located 20\u201350 nts upstream from the 3\u2019splice site, and have a consensus sequence CU(A/C)A(C/U) where A is a most conserved base. The sequence between the branch point and the acceptor site is a run of 15\u201340 pyrimidines (mostly U) and is referred to as a \u201cpolypyrimidine track.\u201d",

During the initial step, snRNP, U1, and U2 recognize the intron sequences at the 5\u2019 splice site and the branch point via complementary base-pairing involving the U2 accessory proteins U2AF65 and U2AF35, which associate with the polypyrimidine track and 3\u2019splice site, respectively (Fig. 1a). Intron recognition is a signal for the formation of a large protein complex called the \u201cspliceosome\u201d where intron removal takes place [8, 9] by two transesterification reactions (Fig. 1b). First, the primary transcript is cleaved at the intron 5\u2019 end (5\u2019 splice site) to leave the upstream exon free; this step is followed by branching of the cleaved intron 5\u2019 end to the branch point (usually A) to create a looped structure named \u201clariat intermediate\u201d. In the second step, the hydroxyl group of the free exon attacks the intron 3\u2019 splice site leading to the 3\u2019 splice site cleavage and lariat formation. Simultaneously, a covalent bond is created between two exons to create a mature mRNA. In general, the lariats are quickly released from the spliceosome and degraded in the nucleus.",

As described above, the level of conservation of the sequences at the splice sites and the branch point will affect the strength of the binding of core splicing factors and thus determine the splicing efficiency. RNA splicing is also modulated by a large family of cellular splicing factors containing serine-arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Most of the splicing factors that are differentially expressed in a specified tissues and/or in a development stage are the RNA-binding proteins, which bind to specific RNA cis-element (splicing enhancers or silencers) located within introns and exons [10]. It is now well documented that splicing factors binding to the cis-elements either increase or decrease RNA splicing efficiency depending on the type of splicing factors, the positions of the binding sites, and the overall spliceosome composition [11, 12]. Current studies demonstrate that in addition to splicing factors, other processes such as RNA polymerase rate and chromatin structure also affect RNA splicing [13, 14].",

            "text": "Although all introns in a pre-mRNA could be constitutively spliced out, and all exons are supposedly included in a mature mRNA, there are many examples where an RNA splice site may be not selected constitutively, but instead skipped, during RNA splicing. Consequently, this alternative RNA splicing leads to the production of RNA isoforms with different exon compositions and production of different protein isoforms. In general, there are four major classes of alternative RNA splicing (Fig. 2), including exon skipping, intron retention, usage of alternative exons, and usage of alternative 5\u2019 and alternative 3\u2019 splice site [15]. In addition, alternative promoter or polyadenylation usage can further complicate the alternative RNA splicing. The reason why some of the exons or introns in a pre-mRNA are alternatively spliced is either because of the presence of weak or suboptimal splice signals in the pre-mRNA or due to the lack of a particular splicing factor. It has been noticed that usage of weak splice sites is highly dependent on auxiliary splicing factors binding to the regulatory cis-elements. Since the expression of these factors is variable from cell to cell and from tissue to tissue, alternative RNA splicing is often associated with a specific cell type, tissue, or stage of cell differentiation [16]; this results in the production of various isoforms of transcripts from one gene [17]. Current analysis also revealed that the number of genes with alternative RNA splicing increases with complexity of the organism and ranges from 0.05% in yeast up to 66.8% in human. Thus, alternative RNA splicing is the driving force behind the complexity of the proteome in higher organisms in addition to the total number of the mapped genes.",

First, RNA molecules isolated from samples are separated based on their size by electrophoresis in agarose or polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane, the individual RNA transcripts are detected by an antisense probe specific for the detecting RNA. The probes used for the Northern blot are usually labeled with 32P isotope, enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase), digoxigenin (DIG), or biotin and can be derived from a constitutive exon or an exon-exon junction (Fig. 3a). Constitutive exon-based probes would detect all spliced RNA isoforms and the remaining, unspliced pre-mRNA; these exon-based probes are recommended when the size difference between spliced RNA isoforms and unspliced pre-mRNA is sufficient enough to be separated. If the size difference is too small for two RNA isoforms to be distinguished, an exon junction probe can be used to specifically detect a spliced product. In addition, a specific probe from an alternative exon or intron can be also designed for detection of individual splicing isoforms derived from exon/intron inclusion.",

The protected RNA fragments are separated in the gel by electrophoresis, and their sizes are determined by molecular markers. To distinguish a spliced RNA product, the probe should contain at least one partial intron region that will be digested from the probe due to the lack of the intron sequence in the spliced mRNA.

The most common approach is the amplification over the intron regions by a set of primers in flanking exons. The resulted RT-PCR products vary in sizes depending on how the detecting transcript is spliced. A larger product than the predicted size may represent an unspliced pre-mRNA, or contaminating genomic DNA. The latter can be determined by a minus RT amplification (PCR). A spliced mRNA always gives a smaller RT-PCR product than its pre-mRNA due to removal of intron sequences by RNA splicing (Fig. 4a). Another approach is to specifically amplify a spliced product by using an exon junction primer because the sequence at exon-exon junction is not present in pre-mRNA, nor in genomic DNA. Similarly, a primer based on an alternative exon would amplify only the transcript with the inclusion of that exon (Fig. 4b). After amplification, the size and amount of RT-PCR products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Because of nonlinear nature of PCR amplification, classical PCR only provides semiquantitative data on the abundance of various spliced RNA isoforms.",

            "text": "Currently there are four major detection chemistries widely used in real-time RT-PCR: SYBR green (Molecular Probes), TaqManTM probes [18], Molecular Beacons [19], and ScorpionsTM probes [20]. The principles of these different detection chemistries are described in Fig. 5. As of today, SYBR green and TaqManTM probes represent the most common detection chemistries. SYBR green is a fluorescent dye which has low fluorescence when in solution; however, it becomes highly fluorescent upon binding to double-stranded DNA. On the other hand, TaqManTM probes, Molecular Beacons, and Scorpions probes employ fluorescence resonance energy transfer or F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET, also known as resonance energy transfer [RET] or electronic energy transfer [EET]) to generate a fluorescent signal. The FRET combines the donor fluorescent dye (fluorophore) with a nonfluorescent quenching moiety (quencher). When the fluorescent dye is in close proximity of the quencher, the quencher molecule absorbs the energy and thus blocks fluorescence emission from the fluorophore when excited by light. TaqMan probes are 18\u201322 bp oligonucleotide probes that are labeled with a reporter fluorophore at the 5' end and a quencher at the 3' end; these are thus in close proximity. Each probe is complementary to a region in the middle of the detecting target between the two primers used in the PCR reaction. When Taq polymerase extends the primer to synthesize the nascent strand, the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase degrades the TaqManTM probe annealed to the targeted region and releases the fluorophore from TaqManTM probe and thereby breaks the close proximity to the quencher. As a result, the fluorophore when excited by cycler\u2019s light emits fluorescence, which marks the presence of PCR product. The method determines the amount of product by generation of fluorescent signal, which is measured in \u201creal time\u201d during the entire cycle time of the RT-PCR reaction, which allows the calculation of the amount of PCR product after each amplification cycle. Similar to TaqManTM, the Molecular Beacon and the ScorpionsTM both use probes to detect specific PCR product. However, instead of probe degradation, the signal is generated by physical separation of the fluorophore and quenching moieties after hybridization of the specific probe to the PCR product during amplification (Fig. 5).",

The disadvantage of SYBR green is its binding non-specifically to any DNA including primer dimers and non-specific PCR products; therefore, it is not useful for multiplex amplification of several products in the same reaction. In contrast, TaqManTM, Molecular Beacons, and ScorpionsTM probes specifically detect only a PCR product complementary to probe sequence enabling to distinguish specific from non-specific products. The disadvantage of these detection chemistries is that each PCR product requires synthesis of its own specific probe, which increases the cost per reaction.

Probe-based methods provide higher specificity due to probe hybridization to selected sequences that are not present in non-specific products. To detect only the desired spliced product, the probe and primer should be complementary to a specific exon-exon junction or to an alternatively spliced region. Many commercial manufacturers of synthetic oligos provide free online tools for the design of the most optimal and specific primer pairs based on the provided template sequence.

In tiling arrays, the set of overlapping probes cover the full length of the nascent primary transcript including exons and introns. The analysis of fluorescence for each probe allows the identification of exons and introns based on the difference in signal intensity (Fig. 6bi). The advantage of tiling arrays is their ability to identify known splice events as well as new splice events. Therefore, the tiling arrays are often used as discovery tools. The disadvantages are the requirement of a large amount of probes, which results in time-consuming data analysis. The exon arrays are more commonly used but require the knowledge of splicing events. Several types of probes hybridizing to flanking exons, intron, and exon-exon junctions are designed to detect each splicing event (Fig. 6bii). The fluorescence intensity is detected for each probe, and a mathematical model is applied to determine the occurrence of splicing event. The advantage of exon arrays is the smaller number of probes required, which means simpler data analysis. However, the exon arrays detect only known or predicted splicing variants. Due to their large capacities, the exon arrays can be designed to detect splicing in multiple viral pathogens simultaneously.",

            "text": "Tissue sections historically represent an important tool for the diagnosis of pathological changes during viral infection as well as the detection of viral pathogens at the cellular level. There are two major types of tissue sections: frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Both are routinely used for the detection of viral antigens by various types of staining, but their use in the detection of nucleic acids including spliced transcripts is still relatively rare. The improved sensitivity of current nucleic acid isolation and amplification techniques allows the recovery of nucleic acid from tissue sections for further analysis by PCR and RT-PCR with selective isolation of only the cells of interest by the use of laser capture microdissection to add an additional level of specificity [23, 24]. However, the detection of nucleic acids by in situ hybridization (ISH) directly on tissue sections can provide additional information about gene expression linked with spatial distribution of specific RNA transcripts in a morphological context often at the cellular or even subcellular level. In the past, the nucleic acid molecules including RNA transcripts by ISH were detected by DNA probes labeled with radioisotope (35S, 33P, 3H) [25], which were later replaced by nonradioactive DNA probes labeled with biotin or digoxigenin and detected by chromogenic methods using enzyme-labeled antibodies (CISH) [26]. Labeling probes specific for different transcripts with different fluorophores (FISH) allows detection of multiple targets at the same tissue section. However, the sensitivity was always a limiting factor of ISH techniques. This was caused mainly by the use of DNA probes, which suffer from low affinity to complementary RNA targets and are sensitivity to degradation of RNA-DNA hybrids by RNase H. Development of tyramide signal amplification (TSA) has dramatically improved the sensitivity of DNA probes [27]. Further improvement was seen with the introduction of locked nucleic acid (LNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes with high affinity to RNA molecules and resistance to RNase H degradation [28\u201330]. Detection of RNA splicing by ISH requires a probe to specifically bind only to spliced mRNA without binding to unspliced pre-mRNA or to the genomic DNA in the sample. Historically, this was achieved by designing a probe over exon-exon junction containing sequences present only in spliced transcripts (Fig. 6ci). Another approach in the detection of spliced transcripts by IHS is using co-hybridization of two probes labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophore and the generation of signals by FRET. In principle, each splicing event is monitored by a set of two probes complementary to exonic sequences flanking an intron region. One probe carries a fluorophore acceptor, while the second probe is labeled by a fluorophore donor. When probes bind to genomic DNA or unspliced nascent transcript, their binding sites are separated by intron regions resulting in the distance between the donor and acceptor being too big for the two fluorophores to engage in FRET. However, intron removal by splicing brings the probe binding sites to a proximity close enough for FRET to occur resulting in generation of measurable fluorescence [31] (Fig. 6cii).This results in high specificity and low background. Using a set of probes with different fluorophores allows detection of multiple spliced transcripts or various spliced isoforms of the transcript. In summary, ISH hybridization methods provide a useful tool for the investigation of the distribution not only of protein-encoding transcripts but also of the rapidly growing number of virus-encoded noncoding RNAs, which their role in viral pathogenesis often remains elusive [32]. In situ hybridization methods could be especially suitable in retrospective analysis of archived samples in collections.",

While detection of viral genomes in clinical samples indicates virus infection, the result does not provide information about the stage and dynamic of the virus infection. In many cases the progress of viral replication can be assumed from changes in viral load, but this approach requires multiple sampling during infection and varies between individuals. One major advantage for detection of spliced viral transcripts is that viral RNA splicing reflects viral gene expression and thus indicates active viral infection, providing important information about the status of infection without requiring multiple sampling. The production of viral transcripts and their RNA splicing products are often the first sign of virus replication detectable before the increase of viral load or occurrence of viral-specific antigens or antibodies. Therefore, the detection of active viral infection by RNA splicing may be particularly important for early diagnosis of viral infection and may be critical for successful treatment. Because of direct association of spliced viral transcripts with the level of active viral replication and by monitoring viral RNA, one might be able to provide essential information early enough for initiation of antiviral therapy. A rapid shutoff of viral transcription and RNA splicing could be also the first sign of the blockage of viral replication visible even before the change in viral load by genome copy numbers. In the case of ubiquitous and common viruses, such as members of herpesvirus or parvovirus family, which establish latent infection in the host, detection of RNA splicing of a viral early gene would assist to distinguish viral latent infection from active lytic infection. Such a diagnosis is critical for recipients of the transplant organs where reactivation of latent viruses often leads to transplant rejection.",

Influenza viruses are enveloped RNA viruses with a segmented, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of negative polarity. The number of segments may vary between virus species, with influenza viruses A and B genome having eight segments and influenza C seven segments. In contrast to the majority of RNA viruses, the influenza viruses replicate in the nucleus of host cells because of their dependence on cellular expression machinery [37]. During replication, the viral RNAs are produced by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, viral RNA genomes use short sequences with a cap structure generated by host RNA polymerase II for priming to initiate viral transcription. During infection viral polymerase produces two types of RNAs: one for protein synthesis and the other serving as a template for viral genome replication (see review [38]).",

This large variation among reported studies is most likely attributable to primer selection and PCR performance [66]. TTV isolates have considerable diversity (about 30%) that can be clustered in several genotypic groups without any particular geographical distribution, indicating that TTV likely represents a ubiquitous virus.

Despite the presence of several promoters, all transcripts used the same poly(A) signal for transcription termination (Fig. 11b). The core protein C and polymerase-transcriptase protein P are encoded by a bicistronic pgRNA. Subgenomic preS and S RNAs translate three surface antigens: (1) large [preS1], (2) middle [preS2], and (3) small [S] surface antigens. A short RNA of 0.7 kb encodes X protein, a nonstructural viral protein that presumably has oncogenic potential [74]. A pre-core RNA initiated upstream of pgRNA encodes HBeAg [75, 76].

Huh7 cells seem to produce more spliced RNA than do Hep2G cells. The major spliced product is derived from 30% of pgRNA using nt 2447 5\u2019ss and nt 489 3\u2019ss in genotypes A, C, D, and E. Serum of infected patients or hepatocarcinoma tumor samples frequently contain HBV DNA originating from spliced variants [83, 84]. The level of spliced HBV RNAs in patients varies widely from no splicing to extensive splicing and is related to viral genotype [85]. The role of HBV RNA splicing in the HBV life cycle or in HBV pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. HBV spliced RNAs express two new proteins [86, 87]. A spliced mRNA derived from pgRNA with removal of a 454-nt intron from nt 2447 to 2901 encodes a structural polymerase-surface fusion protein p43 with potential function in the entry [86]. Another single-spliced pgRNA with removal of an intron from nt 2447 to 489 translates a 93-aa fusion protein in size of 10.4 kDa, in which the first 46-aa residues are identical to the N-terminus of the viral polymerase protein followed by the 47-aa residues generated by the frameshift from the second exon. This protein has been referred as hepatitis B splice-generated protein or HBSP [87] and seems to be associated with chronical HBV infection, HBV viral cytopathogenic effect, and HBV immune evasion (see review [88]).",

Currently no disease or pathological condition is associated with AAV infection in humans. The correlation between AAV infection and fetal loss and male infertility has been proposed due to a high prevalence of AAV DNA in placental tissues and in genital tissues of men with abnormal semen [95, 96]. This has not yet been shown to be causal. Because AAV lacks pathogenicity, induces a low immune response, and infects both dividing and nondividing cells with the capability of viral DNA integration into the host genome, AAV has gained attention as a vector for gene therapy (see review [97]).",

AAVs use several different strategies to produce viral products. The first group represents AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, and AAV6, and their viral transcripts originate from one of three viral promoters on the left-hand side of the viral genome and are terminated on a single polyadenylation site on the right-hand side of the genome. The middle part of the transcripts contains a ~300-nt-long intron with a non-consensus 5\u2019 splice site and two 3\u2019 splice sites (Fig. 12a).The efficient splicing requires the presence of both a helper virus and a large Rep protein [98]. While Rep protein seems to be essential for AAV2 splicing, several adenovirus proteins (E1A, E1B, E2a, E4orf6, and VA RNA) as well as some products of herpes simplex virus (UL5, UL8, UL52, and UL29) also have a stimulatory effect on AAV2 splicing [99]. AAV5 and some animal AAVs are in the second group that utilizes three upstream promoters for their transcription, but their genome contains additional polyadenylation sites in the intron region. Transcripts from two upstream promoters are polyadenylated on the internal poly(A) site, whereas spliced transcripts from P41 promoter use a poly(A) site at the right side of the genome (Fig. 12b). The only spliced transcript in AAV5 infections is the Cap transcript which contains a smaller (~240 nt) intron. Interestingly, the splicing of AAV5 Cap transcript is constitutive and highly efficient even in the absence of helper virus infection [100].",

NS1 ORF on the left-side genome translates a 77-kDa nonstructural protein, while a VP ORF on the right-side genome produces two capsid proteins (84-kDa VP1 and 58-kDa VP2). At least nine virus-specific transcripts have been detected following B19 infection [107]; all of which are transcribed solely from a single promoter P6 located upstream of NS1 gene, but are alternatively spliced and terminated at two alternative polyadenylation sites (Fig. 12c) located either in the middle or on the far right side of the genome. By using the poly(A) site in the middle of virus genome, the P6 transcript has an intron in the NS1 ORF, and splicing of this intron from NS1 transcript may create a novel ORF encoding a small accessory 7.5-kDa protein. However, if the poly(A) site on the right-side genome is used for RNA polyadenylation, the P6 transcript becomes a bicistronic (NS1 and VP) transcript with two introns. By splicing to remove the intron 1 from the bicistronic RNA, the single-spliced P6 transcript is capable of encoding both 7.5-kDa and VP1 proteins. Double RNA splicing to remove both intron 1 and intron 2 from the P6 bicistronic transcript disrupts both ORFs for NS1 and VP1, but creates either a VP2 or a novel ORF for another accessory 11-kDa protein, depending on which alternative 3\u2019 splice site is selected (Fig. 12c). Thus, all detected B19 transcripts are derived from a P6 pre-mRNA containing one or two introns with two possible alternative 3\u2019 splice sites depending on the selection of one of two possible alternative poly(A) sites. All detected B19 transcripts are alternatively spliced RNA transcripts, except the unspliced full-length NS1RNA. The cis-elements in the central exon and intron 2 are regulatory elements and control the alternative P6 RNA splicing, with the double-spliced P6 RNAs being the predominant species in the infected cells [107].",

Similar phenomenon has been observed in the expression of late mRNAs. Inclusion of the i-leader exon is generally a signature of early transcripts, but most of the late transcripts contain a classical tripartite leader. While 52,55K L1 RNA is produced during both early and late infection, the IIIa splice site is used only in the late stage of viral infection [114]. Both cellular splicing machinery and viral products have been found to regulate alternative splicing of adenoviral transcripts during the course of viral infection (see reviews [ 110, 115]).",

The Polyomaviridae family contains only one genus Polyomavirus (PyV), which has nine members of the human polyomaviruses: (1) BKPyV [116], (2) JCPyV [117], (3) KI PyV [118], (4) WU PyV [119], (5) Merkel cell PyV (MCPyV) [120], (6) HPyV6, (7) HPyV7 [121], (8) trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated PyV (TSV) [122], and (9) HPyV9 [123]. Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40), a prototype virus of the family, was introduced into the human population as a contaminant in early trials of poliovirus vaccine [124]. Serological data indicate that polyomavirus infection is widespread in the general human population with initial infection occurring in childhood [125]. After the initial infection, polyomaviruses persist in the host for the rest of the life. While initial infection is usually asymptomatic, several human polyomaviruses are associated with various pathological conditions in immunocompromised patients including nephropathy and cystitis associated with BK PyV and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with JCPyV [126], as well as trichodysplasia spinulosa presumably associated with TSV infection. Polyomaviruses expresses an oncoprotein T antigen, and this T antigen may lead to the development of human cancer by an abortive infection as recently confirmed in a rare but aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma [127\u2013129].",

The primary transcript of the T antigen contains two introns, but the first intron 1 has two alternative 5\u2019 splice sites. During RNA splicing, the intron 2 retention is important for production of both large T and small t antigens. However, selection of proximal 5\u2019 splice site in the intron 1 for RNA splicing leads to production of large T antigen, whereas selection of a distal 5\u2019 splice site in the intron 1 results in small t production. Because the sequence region between the proximal 5\u2019 splice site and the distal 5\u2019 splice site has a stop codon, retention of this region in small t RNA splicing makes the small t RNA larger than the large T RNA, but introduction of a premature stop codon in the small t RNA results in production of a smaller protein (Fig. 14b). In addition, a rare tiny t antigen of ~17 kDa has been attributed to double RNA splicing in SV40-infected cells [130]. In this case, the transcript encoding the 17-kDa antigen shows splicing of both introns, but splicing of the intron 1 by selection of the proximal 5\u2019 ss. Similar to SV40, the multiple-spliced RNA species of early transcripts also were detected in other polyomaviruses such as the truncated T antigen (trunc-T Ag) in BKPyV [131], T\u2019135, T\u2019136, and T\u2019165 in JCPyV [132] and T3 and T4 early transcripts in MCPyV [127] (Fig. 14b). Alternative splicing of polymavirus early transcripts allows the expression of multiple T antigens with distinguished function during the viral life cycle. In addition to the cells with actively replicating virus, the early viral transcripts also are expressed in cells with nonproductive infection or in polyomavirus-transformed cells. These cells often do not express late gene product due to integration of the viral DNA into host genome, resulting in dysregulated viral gene expression as well as cell transformation.",

            "text": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of small DNA tumor viruses with a genome of ~8 kb surrounded by a viral capsid. The HPV genome consists of three regions: viral early, late, and noncoding regions and generally encodes eight viral genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, L1, and L2). Viral early gene products are regulatory proteins responsible for virus replication and pathogenesis during a productive infection, whereas the late L1 and L2 genes encode two viral capsid proteins for virus particle formation. Interestingly, almost all viral early genes are expressed from an early promoter upstream of the viral E6 gene and are polyadenylated at an early poly(A) signal downstream of E5 gene. Thus, viral early gene transcripts are polycistronic, with several ORFs in a single RNA molecule, and undergo extensive alternative RNA splicing during viral RNA maturation. In contrast, viral L1 and L2 are commonly transcribed from E7 ORF and polyadenylated at a late poly(A) site downstream of L1 ORF (Fig. 15a). As a result, the 5' sequences of viral L1 and L2 are part of the viral early transcript sequences. RNA splicing to remove most of these early gene sequences from the RNA is important for viral L1 and L2 expression [133].",

HPV is present in >95% of all cervical cancer and is required for initiation of cervical carcinogenesis and maintenance of the cervical cancer cells. Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death for women in the developing world, with about 493,000 new cases and nearly 273,000 deaths each year. More than 200 genotypes of HPVs have been identified to date and are grouped into two major groups based on their pathogenesis and association with cervical cancer [134]. The reference genome sequences are available at https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/#home. The high-risk or oncogenic HPV types are present in cervical cancers, some anogenital cancers, as well as head-and-neck cancers. The low-risk or non-oncogenic HPVs are not associated with cancers [135]. In general, women acquire HPV infection by sexual contact. A number of epidemiology studies have demonstrated that women with repeat exposure to oncogenic HPVs as well as women with persistent cervical infection by oncogenic HPVs are at high risk for developing cervical cancer [136, 137]. Infection with oncogenic HPV-16 and HPV-18, the two most common oncogenic HPV types, leads to the development of almost 70% of all cervical and other types of anogenital cancers. Viral E6 and E7 of the oncogenic HPVs are two viral oncoproteins that inactivate, respectively, cellular p53 and pRB, which are two tumor suppressor proteins essential for cell cycle control [138, 139]. In cervical cancer tissues and cervical cancer-derived cell lines, E6 and E7 oncogenes are highly expressed; the majority of the E6/E7 bicistronic RNA are alternatively spliced as diagramed for HPV-16 and HPV-18. A major spliced RNA isoform of viral E6/E7 bicistronic RNA is E6*I derived from splicing of nt 226 5' splice site to nt 409 3' splice site for HPV-16 and of nt 233 5' splice site to nt 416 3' splice site for HPV-18 (Fig. 15b). It has been demonstrated that this RNA splicing is necessary for viral E7 translation [140] and can be easily detected by RNase protection assay (RPA) or by RT-PCR methods [140, 141].",

These lesions can be detected by routine cervical examination and treated by surgery to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The Papanicolaou test (also called the Pap smear) is a screening test used in gynecology to detect premalignant and malignant cells in cervical swabs. A woman who has a Pap smear with abnormal cells may also be referred for HPV DNA testing by two FDA-approved assays: the Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test, which detects 13 high-risk HPVs (HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51, HPV-52, HPV-56, HPV-58, HPV-59, and HPV-68) and is available from Qiagen [142], or the Cobas 4800 System HPV test, which detects 14 high-risk HPVs (HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51, HPV-52, HPV-56, HPV-58, HPV-59, HPV-66, and HPV-68) and is available from Roche [143]. A few of the HPV E6/HPV E7 RNA tests also have been introduced. The APTIMA HPV Assay from Hologic was designed to detect HPV E6/HPV E7 mRNA from 14 high-risk types (HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51, HPV-52, HPV-56, HPV-58, HPV-59, HPV-66, and HPV-68) [144] with a sensitivity and specificity similar to or better than the Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test [145, 146]. The PreTect HPV-Proofer from PreTect was designed to detect E6 and E7 RNA from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 [147, 148] and is more specific than the HC2 for identifying women with CIN 2+ but has a lower sensitivity [149]. By using the primers detailed in Fig. 15c for RT-PCR assays, the spliced E6/E7 RNAs of HPV-16 and HPV-18 can be easily detected due to an amplicon size smaller than E6/E7 DNA, without worry of any carry-over viral DNA contamination commonly encountered with HPV DNA tests.",

Two forms of LAT RNAs are detectable in latently infected neurons. A major 2.0-kb RNA is produced by splicing of a capped and polyadenylated 8.3-kb primary transcript and represents a unique stable intron while the spliced exonic RNA is unstable and quickly degraded [159]. A minor 1.5-kb RNA is generated by further splicing of the 2.0-kb RNA by removal of an internal intron of 559 or 556-bp, depending on the virus strain [160] (Fig. 6a). Both LAT RNAs are uncapped without a poly(A) tail and accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells. HSV-1 LAT RNA is a noncoding regulatory RNA for establishment and maintenance of viral latency by inhibiting the expression of viral lytic genes and thus interfering with the cellular apoptosis pathway [161]. Recent studies have demonstrated that LAT transcript functions as a precursor for the generation of virus-encoded miRNAs [162]. The expression of LAT-DNA also has been observed during lytic infection. Lytic LAT transcripts differ from latent LAT RNA by the presence of a poly(A) tail [163].",

Antisense expression of LAT transcripts inhibits the expression of ICP0 during latency. ICP0 is an immediate-early gene expressed in the early stage of lytic infection. ICP0 functions as a non-specific transactivator and a cofactor of another viral transactivator ICP4 [164]. ICP0 initiates lytic replication in both newly infected cells as well as after reactivation in cells with latent infection. ICP0 is transcribed in reverse orientation from viral genome, and its pre-mRNA contains three exons separated by two introns [165] (Fig. 16a). After splicing, the mature mRNA encodes ICP0 protein with 775-aa residues. An alternatively spliced ICP0 transcript retaining intron 2 is detectable in the infected cells [166] and encodes a truncated ICP0R in size of 262-aa residues due to the presence of a stop codon in the intron 2. Thus, both ICP0 and ICP0R have the same aa sequences in the N-terminal part. ICP0R functions as a repressor of viral expression [167].",

A major immediate-early region (MIE) located within a unique long (UL) region of the CMV genome contains several genes that are highly expressed during the early stage of viral lytic infection. These include UL123 (IE1), UL122 (IE2), and UL119-115. MIE transcripts contain multiple introns and undergo complex alternative RNA splicing. MIE transcripts IE1 and IE2 are expressed from the same promoter but are alternatively polyadenylated. These transcripts have five major exons and can be alternatively spliced to express additional isoforms of IE1 and IE2 proteins (Fig. 16b). Splicing also was detected in transcripts from other CMV genes such as TRL4, UL89, US3, R160461, and R27080 [172]. Gene UL21.5 (previously named as R27080) is one of the known CMV split late genes (SLG). The UL21.5 transcript that encodes viral glycoprotein is expressed from the UL region posited from nt 27080 to nt 27574 of CMV genome [173] and has a short intron of 83 nts. Removal of this intron leads to production of a mature mRNA in size of ~0.4 kb. Both spliced and unspliced UL21.5 RNAs are easily detectable by RT-PCR from infected cells [174].",

Multiple approaches have been developed to detect CMV viremia in circulating lymphocytes by direct virus isolation with cultivation, by detection of viral antigens in polymorphonuclear cells, or by quantitative viral DNA [175, 176]. However, the detection of viremia is not sufficient for disease prediction since many viremic patients never develop symptoms. However, active CMV replication in peripheral blood lymphocytes can be verified by analyzing viral mRNAs [177]. Amplification of spliced viral transcripts has some advantages in comparison to intronless transcripts and is not affected by DNA contamination. Detection of spliced immediate-early transcripts had been reported to have a good correlation with the detection of viral DNA or viral antigen [178\u2013180].

EBV infection is highly prevalent, with more than 95% of the human population becoming seropositive in early life. While primary infection during childhood is usually unremarkable, the virus acquisition in adolescence and adulthood is often associated with the development of the infectious mononucleosis syndrome. In healthy individuals, the EBV infection is well controlled by the immune system. However, EBV remains in long-living memory B cells where it establishes a latent infection. EBV is an oncogenic virus capable of transforming the infected B cells [183]. EBV infections have been associated with the development of a number of human malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, gastric carcinoma, and others (see review [184]). Active EBV replication due to immunosuppression may cause posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease [185]. During latent infection, EBV expresses six nuclear antigens (EBNA-1, EBNA-2, EBNA-3A, EBNA-3B, EBNA-3C, and EBNA-LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMP-1, LMP-2A, and LMP-2B), and several noncoding transcripts (EBER-1 and EBER-2 and BARTs). Many EBV latent products are defined as oncogenes and are responsible for EBV-mediated cell transformation [115]. Several types of EBV latency have been defined by variable expression of latent genes in a number of malignancies [186].",

Although BRLF1 and BZLF1 are transcribed separately from a different promoter with the Rp for BRLF1 and the Zp for BZLF1, both gene transcripts utilize the same polyadenylation site for RNA polyadenylation [195] (Fig. 17c). Thus, the Zp promoter-derived transcript is a monocistronic ZEBRA RNA containing two constitutive introns; splicing of these two introns results in production of a 0.9-kb mRNA that encodes ZEBRA protein. Transcription from the Rp promoter leads to production of a 3.8-kb bicistronic transcript, ZEBRA/RTA, which contains two additional introns and the ZEBRA RNA. Splicing of the intron 1 in the 5\u2019 noncoding region of ZEBRA/RTA transcript leads to production of a 2.9-kb RNA as a major RNA isoform. However, both isoforms of ZEBRA/RTA RNA have the potential to encode ZEBRA and RTA proteins. A third minor isoform of ZEBRA/RTA transcript is derived from the splicing of an additional internal intron spanning from BRLF1 ORF to BZLF1 ORF; this splicing produces a RAZ transcript of ~0.9 kb encoding a RTA-ZEBRA fusion protein, RAZ. RAZ may function as an inhibitor to ZEBRA during EBV infection [196].",

The core of these techniques represents an amplification and detection of nucleic acids. The advantage of nucleic acid-based techniques is the application of the same platform for detection of various viral pathogens, often at the same time, by multiplexing. The rapid setup of these methods is especially important for a rapid response to emerging viruses as has been successfully proven in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, Zika virus, and Ebola virus outbreaks where nucleic acid amplification was rapidly deployed to detect and to confirm these infections. The low material requirement and their simplicity make these detection methods suitable for applications in low resources setting such as laboratories where the first contact is seen as well as field laboratories. Because the genomic sequences for many viruses can be detected by amplification of the nucleic acid molecules as a routine procedure in many diagnostic laboratories, the detection of spliced viral transcripts could be performed simultaneously using already existing methods.",

(b) RNA splicing is catalyzed by two transesterification reactions. During RNA splicing, the intron (gray) between two exons (black) is removed by two transesterification reactions. First, the intron is recognized by cellular splicing machinery via splicing factors binding to intron-specific sequences as described in (a). Splicing factors carry out the first transesterification reaction between the branch point and the 5\u2019 donor site, resulting of an RNA cleavage at the 5\u2019 donor site and releasing exon 1 and formation of a lariat intermediate. Subsequently, the free 3\u2019end OH group of exon 1 attacks the 5\u2019 end phosphate of exon 2 and joins with the 5\u2019 end of exon 2 via the second transesterification reaction to form a mature mRNA.
