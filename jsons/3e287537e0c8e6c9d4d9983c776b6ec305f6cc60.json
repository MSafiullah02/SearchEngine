The aim of the present analysis is to investigate the rate of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak.",

            "text": "In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic characteristics of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at 15 hospitals in northern Italy. All the hospitals were hubs of local networks for treatment involving primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The study period was defined as the time between the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Italy (February 20, 2020) and March 31, 2020. We compared hospitalization rates between the study period and two control periods: a corresponding period during the previous year (February 20 to March 31, 2019) and an earlier period during the same year (January 1 to February 19, 2020). The primary outcome was the overall rate of hospital admissions for ACS. We calculated incidence rates for the primary outcome by dividing the number of cumulative admissions This report shows a significant decrease in ACS-related hospitalization rates across several cardiovascular centers in northern Italy during the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak. Recent data suggest a significant increase in mortality during this period that was not fully explained by Covid-19 cases alone. 5 This observation and data from our study raise the question of whether some patients have died from ACS without seeking medical attention during the Covid-19 pandemic.
