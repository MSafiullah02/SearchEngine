            "text": "Most ferrets are docile and can be easily examined without assistance. However, an assistant is usually needed when taking the rectal temperature, when administering injections or oral medications, or if an animal has a tendency to bite. Young ferrets often nip, and nursing females and ferrets that are handled infrequently may bite. Unlike dogs and cats, which growl, ferrets will bite without warning. Therefore always ask the owner if the ferret will bite before handling it and take precautions accordingly. Make sure to obtain the rabies vaccination history before physical examination, as reporting and rabies protocols for animal bites from vaccinated and unvaccinated ferrets differ (see below). Ferrets that are prone to bite and are not currently vaccinated for rabies may need tranquilization for procedures that require restraint.",

For tractable animals, lightly restrain the ferret on the examination table. Examine the mucous membranes, oral cavity, head, and integument. Then pick the ferret up and use one hand for support under its body while using the second hand to auscultate the thorax and palpate the abdomen. The ferret can be scruffed at any time for vaccination, ear cleaning, or other procedures that may elicit an attempt to escape or bite. For a very active animal or one that bites, scruff the ferret at the back of its neck and suspend it with all four legs off the table (Fig. 2-1\n). Most ferrets become very relaxed with this hold, and the veterinarian is able to examine the oral cavity, head, and body; auscultate the chest; and palpate the abdomen easily. However, this method may not work for very fractious animals.",

The normal range of rectal temperature of a ferret is 100.5\u00b0F to 102.5\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C to 39.2\u00b0C); a mean of 102\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), with a wider range of 100\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C), is also reported.21 Interestingly, in normal ferrets housed outdoors at a fur farm in very cold ambient temperatures (21\u00b0F [\u22126.1\u00b0C]), the mean 24-hour mean core body temperature measured by sterile thermosensitive data loggers implanted in their abdomens was 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), with a range of 97.3\u00b0F to 101.1\u00b0F (36.3\u00b0C to 38.4\u00b0C).41\n",

Palpate the cranial abdomen, paying particular attention to the presence of gas or any irregularly shaped mass in the stomach area, especially in ferrets with a history of vomiting, melena, or chronic weight loss. The spleen is commonly enlarged in ferrets; this may or may not be significant, depending on other clinical findings (see Chapter 5). Palpate a large spleen gently to avoid iatrogenic damage.

Currently, one vaccine is approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for use in ferrets: PureVax (Merial, Athens, GA). Because PureVax is a canarypox-vectored recombinant vaccine it does not contain adjuvants or the complete distemper virus; thus many of the postvaccination risks have been reduced. This product has a wide safety margin and has proved effective in protecting ferrets against canine distemper infection.58 Another distemper vaccine that was widely used previously (Fervac-D, United Vaccines, Inc., Madison, WI) is no longer available. Fervac-D was a modified live virus vaccine propagated in avian cell lines. Another modified live canine distemper vaccine (Galaxy D, Merck/Schering-Plough Animal Health, Whitehouse Station, NJ) has been studied for safety and efficacy in ferrets. This product, derived from the Onderstepoort distemper strain and attenuated in a primate cell line, proved effective in preventing canine distemper in young ferrets challenged after serial vaccination.64 However, duration of immunity with this product is not known, and its use in clinical animals is extralabel, requiring informed owner consent. Although no vaccine reactions were reported in the study, the incidence of vaccine reactions with Galaxy D is unknown because experience with repeated long-term use in ferrets has been limited.64 Because of the possibility of vaccine-induced disease, especially in immunosuppressed or sick ferrets, do not use combination canine vaccines or vaccines of ferret cell or low-passage canine cell origin.",

Virus antigen was present in the brain tissue of all ferrets with clinical signs of rabies, and virus was isolated from the salivary gland of one ferret. In a similar study of ferrets inoculated with a raccoon rabies isolate, the mean incubation period was 28 days. Virus was isolated from the salivary glands of 63% of rabid ferrets, and 47% shed virus in saliva. Virus excretion began from 2 days before until 6 days after the onset of illness.43 In an earlier study of ferrets with experimentally induced rabies, only mild clinical signs were observed before death.7 Infected ferrets exhibited restlessness and apathy, and some showed paresis. Sick animals did not attempt to bite when threatened, and virus was not excreted in the submaxillary salivary glands of animals that died. In this study, the authors concluded that ferrets are 50,000 times less susceptible to rabies than fox and 300 times less susceptible than hares. In another study, ferrets that were fed up to 25 carcasses of mice infected with rabies did not develop the disease; in contrast, skunks become fatally infected after the consumption of only one carcass.4\n",

In a study of vaccine reactions in 3,857 ferrets, the incidence of adverse events associated with rabies vaccine alone, distemper vaccine alone, and rabies and distemper vaccines together were 0.51%, 1.0%, and 0.85%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly among these three groups; however, the cumulative number of distemper vaccinations received was significantly associated with the occurrence of an adverse event. The distemper vaccines used in this population of ferrets were PureVax and Fervac D; however, the two distemper vaccines were grouped collectively in the analysis, and the incidence of adverse events associated with the individual distemper vaccines was not reported. Sex, age, and body weight were not associated with occurrence of an adverse event. All reactions occurred immediately after vaccination and most commonly consisted of vomiting and diarrhea. In another study of 143 ferrets, the incidence of adverse events after administering distemper (5.9%) (Fervac D), rabies (5.6%) (Imrab-3), or both vaccines (5.6%) was not significantly different. In a 2001 report of vaccine reactions in ferrets reported to the United States Pharmacopeia Veterinary Practitioners\u2019 Reporting Program, 65% (54 of 83) of reports involved administration of FerVac D; 24% (20 of 83) involved concomitant administration of FerVac D and Imrab; and 11% (9 of 83) involved administration of Imrab alone (PureVax was not approved for use at the time these data were collected).37 According to Merial\u2019s product information, the incidence of vaccine reactions with PureVax is 0.3%. No data are available for products not licensed for use in ferrets. Veterinarians are not required to report vaccine-associated adverse events, and surveillance of these events is passive, relying on voluntary reporting by practitioners.37 Vaccine-associated adverse events can be reported to the Center for Biologics, U.S. Department of Agriculture (1-800-752-6255; www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_biologics/vb_adverse_event.shtml).",

Mean prothombin time (PT) was 12.3 seconds (range, 11.6 to 12.7 seconds) measured by fibrometer and 10.9 seconds (range, 10.6 to 11.6 seconds) measured by an automated coagulation analyzer.

Mean fibrinogen concentration was 107.4 mg/dL (range, 90.0 to 163.5 mg/dL), and mean antithrombin activity (AT) was 96% (range, 69.3% to 115.3%).6 In another study, the mean PT was 15.7 seconds (range, 14.4 to 16.5 seconds) in male ferrets.61 In a study of 6 ferrets, values of clotting time of whole blood were 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 minutes in glass tubes and 3.0 \u00b1 0.9 minutes in siliconized tubes; mean PT was 10.3 \u00b1 0.1 seconds; aPPT was 18.4 \u00b1 1.4 seconds; and thrombin time was 28.8 \u00b1 8.7 seconds.31 In the same study, mean values for individual coagulation factors were also determined31 and have been reported elsewhere.17 In a study of 30 intact ferrets (15 male, 15 female), mean bleeding time was less than 2 minutes; PT was 8 to 11 seconds for females and 9 to 10.6 seconds for males; and aPPT was 16 to 21 seconds for females and 17 to 25 seconds for males (E.

Applying a topical anesthetic containing lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% (EMLA cream, AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE) on the venipuncture site approximately 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure may facilitate catheterization in the unanesthetized ferret.

Puncture the skin over the vein with a 20- or 22-gauge needle, taking care to avoid the vein; then introduce a short 22-, 24-, or 26-gauge over-the-needle catheter into the vein. Secure the catheter hub or a tape butterfly wrapped around the hub directly to the skin with suture, tape, or tissue adhesive. Attach a T-connector and wrap the leg with a soft padded bandage. Closely monitor ferrets with indwelling catheters to prevent the fluid line from entangling, and frequently check the leg distal and proximal to the catheter for soft tissue swelling.

Unless the ferret is very depressed, anesthesia is required to place the catheter. Sterilely prepare the insertion site, and in the conscious patient, infiltrate the area with 1% to 2% lidocaine (maximum dose 1 mg/kg).28 Insert a 20- or 22-gauge, 1.5-inch spinal needle into the marrow cavity. Alternatively, use a 20- or 22-gauge hypodermic needle with a surgical steel wire inserted into the lumen to prevent the needle from occluding during insertion.46 The intraosseous catheter should occupy approximately 33% to 67% of the marrow cavity at the narrowest portion.28 In humans, medications and blood products intended for intravenous administration are considered safe to administer via an intraosseous catheter.59 Therapeutic agents should be administered in small volumes while applying minimal pressure to prevent leakage from the insertion site.59 If possible, change to an intravenous catheter as soon as the animal is rehydrated or blood pressure improves. Intraosseous catheters should not be left in place for more than 72 hours.28\n",

            "text": "Epidural administration of analgesics preoperatively appears to be effective in helping to control postoperative pain in ferrets (see Chapter 31). Epidural anesthesia and analgesia is most effective in procedures involving the abdomen, spine, pelvis, hind legs, tail, and perineum.18 In a study of ferrets undergoing ovariohysterectomy and bilateral anal sacculectomy, both physiologic and behavioral manifestations of pain were attenuated in ferrets that received epidural morphine preoperatively compared with control ferrets, and beneficial effects were seen for at least 24 hours.57 The technique has been well described and illustrated.18., 23. Place the anesthetized ferret in sternal recumbency with the legs flexed to open the lumbosacral space. Clip a large rectangle of hair over the injection site (so that anatomic landmarks can easily be identified) and aseptically prepare the area. The injection site is at the intersection of a line drawn between the cranial aspect of the wings of the ilea and a line drawn between the dorsal spinous processes of the last lumber and first sacral (S1) vertebrae; the dorsal spinous process of S1 is easily palpable. Either a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch spinal needle or a 25-gauge hypodermic needle can be used, although a spinal needle will prevent creation of a skin plug that can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or set up a nidus for infection and inflammation.18 Insert the needle on the midline perpendicular to the skin and with the bevel facing cranially. A correctly placed needle will drop through the lumbosacral space until it encounters bone on the ventral floor of the spinal canal. If using a spinal needle, remove the stylet and observe the needle hub for blood or CSF. Confirm correct epidural placement by attaching a 1-mL syringe containing 0.2 mL of sterile saline and 0.2 mL of air and applying gentle suction; no CSF or blood should be seen in the needle hub. No resistance should be encountered when the fluid is injected, and the air space above the fluid should not be compressed. Once correct epidural placement is confirmed, inject analgesic or anesthetic fluids slowly to avoid an increase in intracranial pressures or extended cranial infiltration of the anesthetic block. Morphine is often used for epidural analgesia at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.23 Epidural injection is contraindicated in cases of coagulopathy, sepsis, hypovolemia, skin infection, and local fractures.18\n",

If using a long rubber catheter, estimate the length of the catheter that must be inserted to reach the bladder before placing it. Use a stylet or flexible KE wire to stiffen the catheter while passing. Another option is to use a 20- or 22-gauge, 8-inch jugular catheter with the stylet removed.46 If needed, the stylet can be left in but retracted slightly to provide stiffness, but be very careful when rounding the pelvic flexure to avoid perforating the urethra. Use sterile technique to prepare the urethral and preputial area and pass the catheter. If the urethral opening is difficult to see, dilate the opening by passing a 24-gauge intravenous catheter just inside the tip of the urethra and flushing gently with saline. Then slip the tip of the lubricated urinary catheter gently into the dilated opening alongside the intravenous catheter and, while gently flushing with saline solution, pass the catheter into the bladder. Often resistance is met at the pelvic flexure; if this occurs, try repeated gentle flushing and relubricating the catheter until it passes. Once in place, secure the catheter by suturing the hub to the prepuce if using a Slippery Sam catheter. If using a rubber catheter, place butterfly tape strips around the catheter just as it enters the urethra and at another point 3 to 5 cm distal and suture these to the skin. Attach a sterile urinary collection device, and tape the tubing to the tail to further prevent tension. If needed, bandage the ferret\u2019s abdomen to minimize rotation of the catheter and to restrict the ferret from traumatizing it. Soft Elizabethan collars are needed in some ferrets to prevent chewing at the catheter. Maintain sterility of the collection system, and drain the bag by needle and syringe rather than opening the system (see also Chapter 4).",

Restrain the ferret on its back or in lateral recumbency, and shave and prepare the abdominal skin in the area over the spleen. Palpate and immobilize the spleen directly under the prepped area with one hand while inserting a 25-gauge needle into the spleen several times with the other hand. Then attach an air-filled syringe to express the contents of the needle onto slides. This technique will minimize blood contamination. Alternatively, attach a 25-gauge needle to a 3-mL syringe and aspirate quickly after directing the needle into the spleen. A positive aspirate appears bloody. Detach the needle, fill the syringe with air, and express the samples onto slides. Obtain samples from two sites and prepare several slides for cytologic staining. If an abnormal mass is found on ultrasound examination, perform an ultrasound-guided aspirate to improve chances of a positive result.

However, both methods have shown poor correspondence with direct arterial blood pressure measurements. In one study using 10 healthy adult female ferrets to compare direct blood pressure measurement from the carotid artery to indirect blood pressure measurement from the tail and limbs using both Doppler and oscillometric methods, the indirect systolic blood pressure measurements were approximately 28 to 30 mm Hg less than the direct systolic blood pressures. Accurate indirect blood pressure readings were deemed very difficult to obtain because the neonatal blood pressure cuff did not fit securely on the short limbs of the ferrets (Doppler method) and the tail artery did not produce sufficiently high pressure changes to be detected by the oscillometric system. The authors concluded that indirect blood pressure assessment, using a sphygmomanometer and Doppler probe, could still be considered useful for evaluating changes in blood pressure from a known baseline or for surgical monitoring of general trends.45 In another study using 14 male ferrets, indirect blood pressure measurements using an oscillometric sphygmomanometer and a veterinary high definition oscillometry monitor on the tail, forelimb, and hindlimb were compared with direct arterial blood pressure measurements. Measurements using the tail were considered most reliable; however, the oscillometric sphygmomanometer consistently overestimated the systolic arterial pressure. In addition, the indirect measurements of systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressures obtained with the high-definition oscillometry monitor were consistently higher than the corresponding direct blood pressure measurements during hypotensive states but were substantially lower than the corresponding direct blood pressure measurements in hypertensive states.56 Therefore, be aware of the above described inconsistencies of indirect methods when compared with results of direct blood pressure measurement, and interpret clinical results to measure trends more than for accurate measurements.",

Place the Doppler transducer probe crystal on the shaved skin in a bed of ultrasonic gel and tape or hold in place. Inflate the cuff bladder to a pressure exceeding the systolic blood pressure, which will diminish the Doppler signal of blood flow.
