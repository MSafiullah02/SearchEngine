To further corroborate the existence of catalytically active immunoproteasomes in polarized alveolar macrophages, we used a set of fluorescently labeled activity-based probes (ABPs) with distinct binding specificities to the different active sites. These ABPs covalently bind to the active-site threonine of the respective catalytic subunits and active subunits are quantified after separation of native cell extracts by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1c): Both, immunoproteasome and standard proteasome activities were significantly elevated in M1-polarized alveolar macrophages compared with the control. In M2-polarized macrophages, immunoproteasome activities were only slightly higher consistent with the relatively small increase in expression level after 24 h compared with 72 h of IL-4 treatment (Supplementary Figure S2C). We also observed elevated activities of the standard 20S subunits \u03b21 and \u03b22 and of \u03b25/LMP7 subunits in both M1- and M2-polarized macrophages, which also accords to our protein expression data.",

LMP7 disruption did not affect viability during polarization (Supplementary Figure S3A) and had no effect on M1 marker gene expression such as Nos2, Tnf, Il1b and Il12b (Figure 2a). In accordance, gene expression levels of some of the transcriptional activators of M1 polarization such as Nfkb1, Rela and Irf5 were not altered by LMP7 deficiency (Supplementary Figure S3B). Intriguingly, LMP7 deficiency enhanced the IL-4 effect on alternative M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages (Figures 2b and c). Gene expression of the major M2 marker Arg1, as well as the Th2 cytokine Ccl17 were clearly increased in LMP7\u2212/\u2212 compared with wt cells. In addition, Retnla mRNA expression was considerably elevated in LMP7\u2212/\u2212 cells, whereas Mrc1 expression was not altered. For Arg1 expression, this effect was already evident at lower doses of 1\u20135 ng/ml IL-4 (Supplementary Figure S3C). Secretion of CCL17 into supernatants of polarized alveolar macrophages was also significantly enhanced in M2-polarized cells from LMP7\u2212/\u2212 mice as determined by ELISA. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that expression and activity of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 is of functional importance for alternative M2 activation of alveolar macrophages.",

Although wt and LMP7-deficient macrophages did not significantly differ in their transcriptome at the M0 state, we observed a generally increased expression of IL-4-induced genes in M2-polarized alveolar macrophages from LMP7\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3a and Supplementary Table SII). Among the most regulated genes were the already investigated major M2 markers Arg1, and Retnla as well as the M2 cytokine Ccl17. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of an additional set of nine strongly upregulated genes (Rnase2a, Cish, Clec10a, Tfrc, Ptgs1, Chchd10, Sema4b, Ccr5 and Il1r1) confirmed our array results (Figure 3b). Moreover, gene ontology analysis for all genes that were upregulated in LMP7\u2212/\u2212 M2 alveolar macrophages revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to the biological process \u2018defense response', \u2018response to wounding' and \u2018regulation of inflammatory response', indicative for a prominent M2 inflammation resolving phenotype of LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages (Figure 3c).",

In the volcano plot, we identified the previously described key regulator of M2 macrophage polarization interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)28, 29 as the only transcription factor among the most significantly altered genes (Figure 4b) being 2.5-fold induced by IL-4 in wt but 3.9-fold in LMP7\u2212/\u2212 cells, and finally also expressed at considerable levels (Supplementary Figure S4B). Increased expression of IRF4 in LMP7-deficient M2 macrophages was confirmed by qRT-PCR in a kinetic analysis from 6 to 72 h of IL-4 stimulation (Figure 4c). We also confirmed M2-specific mRNA induction of IRF4 in different primary cells from C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice and in the MH-S cell line (Supplementary Figure S4C). At the protein level, IRF4 increased up to 72 h only after IL-4 stimulation (Supplementary Figure S4D). Moreover, short-term stimulation of alveolar macrophages with IL-4 revealed elevated levels of IRF4 after 180 min in LMP7-deficient cells (Figure 4d). This coincided with aggravated phosphorylation and thus activation of STAT6 and AKT, the two major signaling hubs for IL-4-induced M2 polarization (Figures 4e and f, Supplementary Figures S4D and E).22, 23",

Of note, although Il4ra mRNA expression was not affected by the genotype at any polarization condition (Figure 6a), IL4R\u03b1 protein expression was significantly elevated in LMP7\u2212/\u2212 macrophages at baseline and in response to IL-4 stimulation compared with wt macrophages (Figure 6b).

These have been shown to have altered enzyme kinetics that may account for the distinct phenotypes of the single immunoproteasome knockout animals.9, 12, 37, 38 In order to exclude that the presence of mixed immunoproteasomes in LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages accounts for augmented IL-4 signaling and M2 polarization, we specifically inhibited the catalytic activity of LMP7 in alveolar macrophages using the LMP7-specific inhibitor ONX-0914 and assayed for M2 polarization. This approach also allowed us to investigate the druggability of immunoproteasome-dependent alternative activation of alveolar macrophages. ONX-0914 is the first of a novel class of site-specific immunoproteasome inhibitors that preferentially binds to the LMP7 catalytic site as demonstrated by crystal structure analysis of mouse immunoproteasomes4 and active site-based ELISA.6 It has been shown to provide potent in vivo anti-autoimmune activity in several mouse models.6, 5 Here, we used an activity-based pulldown to prove increased binding specificity of ONX-0914 to LMP7 over \u03b25 and thus preferential inhibition of LMP7. Importantly, pretreatment of primary as well as MH-S cells with ONX-0914 increased IL-4 triggered M2 polarization. Again, IL4R\u03b1 expression and STAT6 signaling were considerably augmented by impairment of LMP7 function. These results not only replicate our findings with alveolar macrophages of LMP7-deficient mice and reveal a novel role for the immunoproteasome in innate immune cell function but also provide proof-of-concept evidence for the specific therapeutic targeting of LMP7-specific proteasome activity for regulating alternative activation of alveolar macrophages.",

            "text": "The essential role of alveolar macrophage plasticity for the maintenance of respiratory health is well established.23, 27 Pro-inflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages not only fight invading pathogens but also contribute to tissue damage of infected airways.44 In a similar manner, M2-polarized cells are not only required for proper resolution of airway inflammation or pulmonary wound healing,16 but excessive M2 activity also contributes to the pathology of chronic lung diseases characterized by increased tissue remodeling as evidenced for asthma but also suggested recently for pulmonary fibrosis.45, 46, 47 Specifically, isolated macrophages obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis reveal an alternatively activated phenotype, produce high levels of the Th2-related chemokine CCL18 and stimulate fibroblast collagen production.25 In contrast, in the Th2-driven inflammation and fibrosis model of helminth infection, alternatively activated macrophages have been shown to counterbalance acute inflammation, inhibit Th2 cell differentiation and cytokine production thereby contributing to reduced fibrosis.48, 49 The specific role of alternatively activated macrophages thus appears to be disease-dependent and may be further influenced by the origin of the macrophages as tissue-resident alveolar macrophages or inflammatory blood-derived macrophages. In support of this notion, inflammatory monocytes facilitate progression of pulmonary fibrosis, whereas alternatively activated lung macrophages have a resolution-promoting potency during the reversible phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.24 In the same model, the inhibitory cell surface receptor, paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B), which is abundantly expressed on myeloid cells of fibrotic lungs, was shown to inhibit pulmonary fibrosis and alternative macrophage polarization, suggesting that PIR-B inhibits the profibrogenic properties of alternatively activated alveolar macrophages.50 In this context, recent research indicates that M2-skewed alternative activity of lung macrophages and in particular, M2-mediated induction of CCL17, enhances their profibrotic program, and/or causes a Th2-prone pathological setting thus paving the way for pulmonary fibrosis or asthma.51, 52, 53 Augmentation of alternative macrophage activation by immunoproteasome dysfunction most likely has important consequences for homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli of the pulmonary tissue. Intriguingly, there is not much known about regulation of immunoproteasome expression and activity in respiratory disease. A recent study suggested elevated expression of immunoproteasome subunits in alveolar macrophages in patients with sarcoidosis.54 Preliminary data of our group also suggest increased protein levels of LMP7 in BAL cells isolated from fibrotic lungs of bleomycin instilled mice. Future studies using LMP7-deficient mice will investigate the functional relevance of LMP7 activity for the course of bleomycin-triggered pulmonary fibrosis. Immunoproteasome function in macrophages has also been reported to be affected by alcohol and virus infection.55 Our own data indicate downregulation of immunoproteasome function in the lung by cigarette smoke.56 These data support the notion that immunoproteasome function in macrophages is affected by environmental stimuli and possibly altered in the course of pulmonary fibrosis. Promoting pro-resolving M2 macrophage polarization represents a promising strategy to alleviate excessive inflammatory conditions as exemplified by corticosteroid treatment of patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in case of acute exacerbations.57, 58, 59 Under more severe inflammatory conditions of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury, however, therapeutic application of steroids remains controversial as these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome during late stages of ARDS.59, 60 Alternative strategies of macrophage modulation that protect against acute lung injury include deletion of Akt2 kinase to effectively enhance M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages in mice while completely abrogating M1 polarization.61 However, protection was limited to aseptic ARDS conditions, as the complete blocking of classical macrophage activation impaired innate immune response of alveolar macrophages to live bacteria, which is required for effective bacterial clearance. Therapeutic strategies that augment M2 activation but retain M1 plasticity may thus be more favorable for the treatment of acute lung injury. Immunoproteasome-specific inhibition may represent according to our results a more favorable approach for the treatment of pneumonia- or sepsis-related ARDS.",
