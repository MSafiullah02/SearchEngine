            "text": "Critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suffered both high thrombotic and bleeding risk. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on coagulation and fibrinolysis is not well known. We conducted a retrospective study of critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) a cause of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and we evaluated coagulation function using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) on day of admission (T0) and 5 (T5) and 10 (T10) days after admission to ICU. Coagulation standard parameters were also evaluated. Forty patients were enrolled into the study. The ICU and the hospital mortality were 10% and 12.5%, respectively. On ICU admission, prothrombin time was slightly reduced and it increased significantly at T10 (T0 = 65.1 \u00b1 9.8 vs T10 = 85.7 \u00b1 1.5, p = 0.002), while activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen values were higher at T0 than T10 (32.2 \u00b1 2.9 vs 27.2 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.017 and 895.1 \u00b1 110 vs 332.5 \u00b1 50, p = 0.002, respectively); moreover, whole blood thromboelastometry profiles were consistent with hypercoagulability characterized by an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation [i.e., CFT below the lower limit in INTEM 16/40 patients (40%) and EXTEM 20/40 patients (50%)] and significant higher clot strength [MCF above the upper limit in INTEM 20/40 patients (50%), in EXTEM 28/40 patients (70%) and in FIBTEM 29/40 patients (72.5%)]; however, this hypercoagulable state persists in the first five days, but it decreases ten day after, without returning to normal values. No sign of secondary hyperfibrinolysis or sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) were found during the study period. In six patients (15%) a deep vein thrombosis and in 2 patients (5%) a thromboembolic event, were found; 12 patients (30%) had a catheter-related thrombosis. ROTEM analysis confirms that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had a hypercoagulation state that persisted over time.",

Tang et al. [3] reported 11.5% mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and noted that 71.4% of non-survivor patients had abnormal coagulation profile consistent with DIC. A metaanalysis [20] found that a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold increased risk of severe disease (OR, 5.1; 95% CI 1.8-14.6) and an even lower platelet count was associated with mortality in those patients. In our study, laboratory tests did not show a significant alteration of hemostatic parameters such as PT and aPTT; platelet count and fibrinogen values were high over time. However, 15% of patients presented DVT confirmed by ultrasonography and two patients presented an incidental thromboembolic event documented with pulmonary computer tomography at hospitalization; moreover, 30% of patients suffered from related catheter thrombosis. Klok et al. [21] have found in a population of 184 ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a DVT incidence of 27% and 81% of pulmonary embolism (PE). Probably, our lower incidence of DVT than Klok was correlated to the lower number of patients included in the study. Moreover, in our study two cases of PE were incidental; therefore, we cannot really establish the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in these patients.",

Recent evidence showed that \"cytokine storms\" triggered by COVID-19 infection can cause clotting disorders which may increase the risk of thromboembolism [1] . Sepsis is considered a risk factor for VTE, including upper and lower extremity DVT and PE [22] . The underlying pathogenesis of VTE in sepsis remains incompletely understood but is believed to be the result of multiple factors. In addition to risk factors for hypercoagulability, as originally described by Virchow, incorporating the three original triad (stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability), severe inflammation observed in patient with sepsis and/ or septic shock represents the fourth factor for thromboembolic complications [23] . Inflammation increases pro-coagulant factors, and inhibits natural anticoagulant pathways and fibrinolytic activity, leading to DVT and PE [22] . In fact, the inflammatory process initiated by septic shock may be strained by coexisting tissue hypoxia and systemic inflammation leading to endothelial damages and DVT complications.",
