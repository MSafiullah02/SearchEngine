At the global level, water is a limited resource, fact which requires care in its use for a sustainable preservation of water resources. Clean, safe, and hygienic water are other aspects that people take care for assuring public health. The consumption of water of inadequate quality could lead to high rates of waterborne disease. The quality of tap water is not always the best, reason for which in the last years, consumption of bottled water has increased. But although people perceive the bottled water being clean and safe, this is not always the truth, the bottled water being also chemically or microbiologically contaminated, raising risks for diseases (Khaniki et al., 2010).",

In general, the following indicator parameters are used to determine the degree of microbiological contamination of water: total number of microorganisms grow at 22\u00b0C; total number of microorganisms grow at 37\u00b0C; total coliform bacteria (total coliforms), fecal coliforms; the presence of Escherichia coli; fecal streptococci (enterococci).",

Coliform bacteria belong to Enterobacteriaceae family and include species of the following genera: Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Hafnia, Klebsiella, Serratia, and Yersinia. The presence of coliform microorganisms in drinking water represents a sign of fecal contamination and indicates the potential contamination also with pathogenic bacterial species such as Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., or Vibrio cholerae.

The main sources of contamination with Campylobacter spp. are consumption of raw meat, untreated drinking water, raw milk, and the presence of pets (Brown et al., 2004; Friedman et al., 2004). Also, the most common species isolated in developed and developing countries are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Their presence in water is due to wastewater discharge and farming activities (Evans et al., 2003). Survival of Campylobacter in different type of waters (ground, surface, and drinking waters) is conditioned by a variety of factors such as temperature, nutrients, water microbiota, and biotic interactions (Talibart et al., 2000; Cools et al., 2003). A study by Tatchou-Nyamsi-K\u00f6nig et al. (2007) whose objective was to evaluate C. jejuni survival of at 4\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C in filtered natural mineral water proved that the microaerophilic C. jejuni survive better at temperature around 4\u00b0C, high temperatures (16\u201322\u00b0C) affecting the cell viability. The study also demonstrated that even in the presence of biodegradable organic matter the bacteria could survive and multiply for a relatively long time, despite of the presence of oxygen, especially at low temperature (Tatchou-Nyamsi-K\u00f6nig et al., 2007).",

P. aeruginosa is Gram-negative opportunistic bacteria which are responsible of a wide range of infections especially in patients with compromised host defense mechanisms (Zamberlan da Silva et al., 2008). The presence of P. aeruginosa causes urinary and respiratory tract infections, in patients who are severely immunocompromised (e.g., patients with neutropaenia, cystic fibrosis, and severe burns), being difficult to eradicate due to its high intrinsic resistance and ability to transfer its resistance genes. P. aeruginosa requires a high oral infectious dose, of minimum 1.5 million bacteria to cause an infection and normally P. aeruginosa does not infect the healthy tissue. P. aeruginosa cannot grow and survive in natural mineral water, and when detected, it is in low numbers (Leclerc and Moreau, 2002). Edberg et al. (1996) conducted a study in which they determined the numbers and types of bacteria found in three water sources (bottled water, water cooler water, and tap water). They took samples from a wide variety of water types and determined the presence of heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria, total coliforms, and P. aeruginosa. They also determined the virulence factors expression, susceptibility to antibiotics, acid lability, and cytotoxicity testing using Hep-2 cells. Their results showed that all water sources presented a normal bacterial content, and only 2% of bottled water samples were positive for P. aeruginosa.",

NTM species can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. In AIDS the major mycobacteria species and the most common cause of death is Mycobacterium avium. In an US study focusing on M. avium and M. intracellulare in drinking water showed that these mycobacteria can be clinically relevant in human population. From 139 cisterns, noncarbonated bottled waters, or reservoir samples, 46 (33%) were positive for NTM.

Hepatitis E virus has a 7.2-kb single-stranded RNA genome that forms 27\u201334 nm non-enveloped virions. The virus has at least four distinct genotypes, 1 and 2 infect only humans, and are responsible for the majority of human diseases caused by infection with this virus, and genotypes 3 and 4 are found among mammalian animals, including pigs, wild boar, deer, and only occasionally infect humans. Genotypes 1 and 2 have been associated with large waterborne outbreaks, and genotype 3 has been identified in occasional small foodborne outbreaks reported from developed countries. Heating to 60\u00b0C for a few minutes has been shown to inactivate a large proportion of HEV particles suggesting that drinking water can be rendered safe by pasteurization or boiling. Several epidemics of hepatitis E have been found to be related to the failure of chlorination, suggesting that chlorine treatment protects against hepatitis E. Thus, although there is no direct evidence that chlorine inactivates HEV, chlorination of drinking water with adequate residual chlorine levels at the point of consumption continues to be a good public health intervention (De Serres et al., 1999).",

But, the risk for health should not be minimized, taking into account the microbial metabolic diversity and versatility, making different species capable to survive, and even multiply in the conditions offered by bottled waters and beverages. On the other hand, the supplementary procedural steps (packaging, bottling, handling, transport) may sometimes increase the risk of microbial contamination of the final product. Therefore, the consumption of bottled waters and beverages is not free of any risks regarding microbial contamination and consequent water or foodborne disease, especially in countries where the legislation and control of these products are not strictly regulated and respected.",
