We changed the volume of trisodium\ncitrate acid from 300 to 1600 \u03bcL to acquire different-sized\nAuNPs. The morphology of the prepared AuNPs and DLS records are reported\nin Figure 2a. According\nto the TEM images and DLS measurements, the average diameter of AuNPs\ndecreased as the amount of trisodium citrate dehydrate increased.\nFor instance, the addition of reducing agents (300, 500, 1200, 1600\n\u03bcL) allow us to synthesize 72-, 41-, 26-, and 19-nm-sized gold\nnanospheres, respectively.

            "text": "To consider\nthe disulfide self-assembled reaction dependence on target DNAs and\ntheir concentrations, we measured the absorption change of the AuNP\nsolution before and after adding 0.1 M MgCl2 in the presence\nor absence of each target using a UV\u2013vis spectrometer. When\nthe target was absent, the wavelength was shifted more toward the\nred side of the spectrum compared to when the target was present.\nThe wavelength peak shifts were 11, 19, and 51 nm after complementary\nbinding reactions between probes and (i) ORF1a, (ii) upE, and (iii)\nTMV, respectively ((i) 522 to 533 nm, (ii) 520 to 541 nm, and (iii)\n521 to 572 nm) (Figure 4a,b). Due to the broad spectrum of the negative control, delta centroid\nwas estimated as 2.5 times greater than a positive reaction (avg.\n29 nm vs avg 12 nm). These changes indicate that positive samples\n(ORF1a and upE) that are a mixture of thiol-modified probes and their\ntarget DNA that hindered the aggregation of AuNPs through composition\nof the long self-assembled structures. Negative samples (TMV) were\nunable to form long self-assembled structures due to mismatched targets.\nFurthermore, we calculated a p-value to prove the\nreproducibility of this colorimetric platform (Figure 4b). The p-value is the probability\nthat might yield the same results observed in the biological study,\nif the null hypothesis is true. All data groups were found to pass\nthe null-hypothesis assuming a normal distribution was followed.32 Therefore, the p-value of the\ndelta centroid implies that this assay is considered statistically\nsignificant (p-value <0.01).",
