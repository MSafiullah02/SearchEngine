The goals are to assess the burden of infectious diseases, identify important problems, monitor the efficacy of specific interventions and support rational hospital policies.1 The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System was established in the 1980s. HCAIs were reported to be significantly decreased in hospitals that adopted surveillance programmes.2, 3 Hospital-wide surveillance programmes are highly labour intensive and tend to divert resources needed to implement control measures and prevention activities. Consequently, they are often of minimal interest to hospital policymakers except during major outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It has become increasingly apparent that hospital support for surveillance programmes needs to be justified by improved outcomes. To accomplish these goals they must be closely linked to effective interventional strategies.",

Hospital charts were reviewed to identify patients with HCAIs according to definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the help of infectious disease physicians at weekly meetings.4, 5, 6 The data were collected on standardised data collection forms (Appendix 1) and incorporated into the computer database by manual entry.

Prevention and control measures for surgical site infection (SSI) included intensified surveillance of SSI with feedback to the surgeons during 1988\u20131990, monitoring the timing and choice of prophylactic antibiotics, reinforcement of aseptic procedures, amelioration and monitoring ventilation in the operation rooms since 1991, and enhanced environmental cleaning in 1992. Organism-specific isolation precautions for meticilllin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were initiated in 1990 and this was augmented in 1993 for extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) in 2001 and SARS-specific precautions during March to June 2003.7, 8, 9 The infection control guideline for XDRAB requiring contact isolation (single room cohort) was introduced in 2001. This was reinforced the following year by requiring ICNs to inform staff to isolate patients with XDRAB. Hospital-wide surveillance of HCAIs was interrupted temporarily during the SARS epidemic because the ICNs were fully occupied with containing SARS. The infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes. The hospital-wide hand hygiene programme was instituted in April 2004 and has continued as an annual campaign. Targeted surveillance and control for device-associated infections in ICUs (e.g. urinary catheters, central venous catheters, and ventilators) and SSI for selected surgical procedures were initiated in 2000 and intensified since 2005. Data were analysed and compared with national and international data and feedback every quarter.",

However, there was no PDS apart from those patients readmitted for postoperative complications. Changes in HCAIs may be due to multiple factors (e.g. implementation of targeted surveillance, SARS outbreak, multidrug-resistant organism outbreaks, active surveillance, etc.), and the rates of HCAI may fluctuate over time. We instituted several focused control programmes to deal with the increasing occurrence of MRSA and XDRAB. These consisted of more intense surveillance, strict isolation procedures for patients with XDRAB and a hand hygiene programme to control multidrug-resistant organisms.",

Therefore when considering HCAIs, regional factors should be considered. Despite these achievements we have not as yet been able to achieve our goal to reduce overall infection rates below 4.5%. It may be impossible to reduce the rate in a structurally and immunocompromised patient population that requires aggressive antimicrobial therapy for endogenous infections. A third of patients had one or more malignancies. This hospital also maintains very active organ and bone marrow transplantation programmes and ICUs. Rates of infection are more meaningful when adjusted for major underlying diseases and disease severity, such as the Charlson comorbidity index, the McCabe\u2013Jackson criteria and Acute Physiological Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score.13, 29, 30 It is apparent from these observations that there needs to be a major shift in hospital infection prevention and control measures from passive surveillance to focused control programmes of proven efficacy.5 The CDC 12-step campaign to prevent antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings provides a good start. Some of the key measures optimise conditions that prevent infections, e.g. removing an unnecessary device, minimising broad spectrum antibiotics, avoiding long term antimicrobial prophylaxis, treating infection rather than colonisation, and preventing transmission. Our major successes were achieved when we adopted some of these measures.",
