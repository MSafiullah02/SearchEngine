Several studies have stressed the frequent occurrence of viral and bacterial coinfections in children with pneumonia [Juv\u00e9n et al., 2000; Michelow et al., 2004; Templeton et al., 2005] . The occurrence of viral coinfections has received little attention, probably because previously available detection methods (cell culture, antigen detection, serological methods) lacked sensitivity. The advances made in the last few years in molecular diagnosis have improved the reliability and sensitivity of virologic diagnostic methods and have increased the number of viruses that can be included in the respiratory viral panel to be investigated. In the present study, we investigated the presence of 14 viruses associated with acute respiratory infection in a group of children with community-acquired pneumonia, with particular emphasis on the study of the newly discovered human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] , coronavirus NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] , and human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] , as well as viral coinfections.",

Each PCR run included a negative control (water control) that was treated identically to the clinical samples throughout. All procedures were performed with the usual precautions to avoid contamination. Four multiplex nested PCR methods were used to detect: (1) virus influenza (using specific primers for the A, B, and C nucleoprotein genes [Coir\u00e1 s et al., 2004] and H1 and H3 hemagglutinin genes [Stockton et al., 1998] [Drosten et al., 2003] , and specific primers for coronavirus NL63 [Vabret et al., 2005] ). HMPV [Kaida et al., 2006] and rhinovirus [Steininger et al., 2001] were investigated by nested PCR, while the presence of adenovirus [Xu et al., 2000] , and the matrix gene of influenza A virus [Fouchier et al., 2000] , were investigated using PCR methods. HBoV detection was performed through PCR using primers derived from the NP1 gene [Allander et al., 2005] with subsequent investigation of the presence of the VP1 gene in positive samples [Bastien et al., 2006] . Genetic analysis of the gene fragments amplified of HMPV and coronaviruses (broadly reactive method) were sequenced in an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), followed by comparison with sequences at the BLAST website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast).",

DOI 10.1002/jmv evidence of the etiology of pneumonia, and, also the study lacked a control group. However, obtaining pulmonary or lower airways specimens from these patients would not have been ethical, as invasive procedures would have been required. Moreover, the procedures currently available to diagnose bacterial infections are unsuitable because, unlike viruses, bacteria are part of normal flora and distinguishing between commensal bacteria of upper respiratory tract and bacteria causing respiratory illnesses is often unfeasible. In children, currently available techniques for the diagnosis of bacterial respiratory infections have a low diagnostic yield, for example, blood or pleural isolation of S. pneumoniae has low sensitivity, while pneumococcal antigenuria-the most sensitive method in adults-has low specificity. For these reasons, we have refrained from discussing bacteriological results and have focused the present study on virological results. In addition, knowledge about the biology and clinical relevance of some of the recently identified respiratory viruses, like the HBoV, is limited [Schildgen et al., 2008] . Therefore, their detection may represent asymptomatic persistence, prolonged shedding, or other situations. Nevertheless, although some cases may have been the result of a concurrent viral isolation in the presence of bacterial pneumonia and others may have been mixed bacterial and viral infections, it is believed that overall this study highlights the important role played by viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with communityacquired pneumonia.",

One or both of these new viruses were detected in one out of every four episodes of pneumonia. The most frequent virus in this series was RSV, a result consistent with those of other large series of community-acquired pneumonia in children aged less than 3 years old [Juv\u00e9n et al., 2000; Henrickson et al., 2004; Sinaniotis and Sinaniotis, 2005] . The second most frequent virus was HBoV (14.2%), an important finding of this study. This result confirms those of Fry et al. [2007] who recently detected HBoV in 11.9% of children aged less than 5 years old with pneumonia compared with 2.4% in children without respiratory infection. HMPV has frequently been associated with a diagnosis of pneumonia in children [Williams et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2006 ]. In the present series, HMPV also occupied a prominent place, being detected in 11.5% of the episodes studied. The new coronavirus NL63, which has shown a strong association with croup , was found in 1.5% of pneumonia cases, this being one of the few series of childhood lower respiratory tract infections in which its presence has been reported. Another relevant finding of this study was the frequency of parainfluenza virus type 4 detection (11 patients, 2.9%). Parainfluenza virus type 4 is a relatively unknown and uncharacterized virus, which has a low recovery rate in cell culture, having being therefore underreported in other studies. The findings of this study, together with those of other authors [Garcia Garcia et al., 2002; Lau et al., 2005] , suggests that parainfluenza-4 should be included in the panel of viruses investigated in the diagnosis of childhood lower respiratory tract infections. The results of this series, looking at the combination of a great number of viruses with sensitive virus-detection assays, re-enforce previous descriptions obtained in studies that have focused on one virus or a minor number of viruses.",

            "text": "In the present study, 27% of the episodes of childhood community-acquired pneumonia in which viruses were detected corresponded to viral coinfections, a percentage that increased to 35% in the cold months of the year. To our knowledge, this is the series of community-acquired pneumonia in children that has documented a higher rate of viral coinfection. However, some recent studies that included other lower acute respiratory infections, mainly acute expiratory wheezing in children, reported viral coinfections of 20% [Aberle et al., 2005] and 34% respectively [Allander et al., 2007] . The virus producing the highest percentage of coinfections was HBoV. Numerous publications have reported that HBoV is commonly detected together with other viruses in distinct types of infection [Choi et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007; Vicente et al., 2007] . In this study, however, other viruses circulating in the cold months also showed high percentages of coinfection (RSV 51%, influenza A virus 57%, etc.). The viruses most frequently detected as single infections were those whose circulation coincided least with that of the most prevalent viruses (HBoV and RSV), whether circulating throughout the year (rhinovirus), or towards the end of winter, spring and beginning of summer (parainfluenza, HMPV), or even showing isolated circulation in the summer (adenovirus). These results suggest that the percentage of coinfection of each virus is determined by the greater or lesser possibility of its seasonal circulation coinciding with that of another virus. Viral coinfections were most frequently observed in younger children, probably as a result of the greater incidence of respiratory viruses, as a whole, in this age group [Drews et al., 1997] . Therefore, although we cannot definitively rule out preferential interactions among specific viruses, apart from the greater susceptibility in younger children, the frequency of coinfections seemed to be mainly related to the time of year in which viral circulation occurs. Some authors have pointed out that viral coinfections may have a worse prognosis than single infections [Drews et al., 1997; Greensill et al., 2003; Aberle et al., 2005; Foulongne et al., 2006] , but this association has not been found by others [Choi et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2006] . The present study indicates greater severity in viral coinfections than in single viral infections due to the greater frequency of hospitalization in coinfected patients. This association persisted after an age-stratified analysis was performed and other possible variables such as the type of infecting virus were included.",
