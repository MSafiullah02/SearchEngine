Early detection of affected patients 39 within the huge population of patients with common cold symptoms is an important 40 element of this effort but often hindered by limited testing resources. We aimed to 41 identify predictive risk profiles for a positive PCR result in primary care. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health systems, citizens and policy 69 makers worldwide (1). The early political implementation of individual distancing has 70 slowed down the reproduction rate of the virus in Germany significantly (2) is the question of how far positive and negative patients differ in their initial clinical 83 presentation. The more precisely physicians use SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, the more 84 efficient it is. Statistically, this is reflected in Baye's theorem: The quality of a test is not 85 only determined by specificity and sensitivity, but also depends on the pre-test 86 probability of the event to be tested. Thus, if the pre-test probability for COVID-19 is 87 higher, the probability that a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patient is actually ill (positive-88 predictive value = PPV) is increased (4) .

Our data 262 show that the testing of all first-degree contacts, including asymptomatic ones can be of 263 merit and that anosmia, even as an isolated symptom is a clear indication of COVIDare an essential part of the testing strategy in most countries. 266 Based on their intensive experience with respiratory tract infections, they are able to 267 clinically assess a large number of patients with cold symptoms in a short period of time 268 and, if necessary, perform PCR testing.
