            "text": "Medical errors are a major public health concern and a leading cause of death worldwide. Many healthcare centers and hospitals use reporting systems where medical practitioners write a preliminary medical report and the report is later reviewed, revised, and finalized by a more experienced physician. The revisions range from stylistic to corrections of critical errors or misinterpretations of the case. Due to the large quantity of reports written daily, it is often difficult to manually and thoroughly review all the finalized reports to find such errors and learn from them. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ranking approach, consisting of textual and ontological overlaps between the preliminary and final versions of reports. The approach learns to rank the reports based on the degree of discrepancy between the versions. This allows medical practitioners to easily identify and learn from the reports in which their interpretation most substantially differed from that of the attending physician (who finalized the report). This is a crucial step towards uncovering potential errors and helping medical practitioners to learn from such errors, thus improving patient-care in the long run. We evaluate our model on a dataset of radiology reports and show that our approach outperforms both previously-proposed approaches and more recent language models by 4.5% to 15.4%.",

            "text": "Medical errors are a pervasive problem in healthcare that can result in serious patient harm [11] . To identify and reduce the occurrence of preventable errors, many medical centers use reporting systems to document cases. Initial reports are often reviewed and revised by more experienced physicians. The revisions could be due to stylistic reasons or (more importantly) misinterpretations/errors in the initial report. In such cases, to prevent recurrence of the errors, is crucial to identify reports with substantive differences between the original and final report and discuss them with the clinician who wrote the initial report. It is often challenging to manually identify such cases among the large number of daily written reports in a timely manner. In this work, we propose an approach for ranking revisions of medical reports by the degree of discrepancy between the different versions of the report. This allows medical practitioners to easily find the reports in which they made an error, which helps them learn from their mistakes and prevent future similar errors. This is a challenging task to automate because the edits that an attending physician makes to a report can range from stylistic differences to significant discrepancies that may have a major effect on the patient (e.g., an unobserved mass). See Fig. 1 for an example of significant and non-significant discrepancies from radiology reports. As we can see, differences between the significant and non-significant discrepancies are often not trivial to identify and requires more than just comparing surface word changes in the versions of the reports. Furthermore, significant discrepancies can occur relatively frequently in practice; in our dataset collected from a large urban hospital, around 7% of reports contained significant errors. With hundreds of reports generated a week at some hospitals, this can amount to a considerable number of errors. We address this problem by proposing a supervised ranking approach for clinician's revised reports by the degree that there are significant discrepancies between their preliminary report and the final corrected report. I.e., our goal is to rank revisions that are more likely due to errors higher than revisions that are merely due to stylistic changes. We aim to rank report revisions by the significance of the discrepancy.",

These works often treat the problem as classification and the most successful ones leverage a variety of textual similarity measures. Viewing this problem as ranking is a more suitable and practical form of evaluation; given a doctor's limited time, it is important for them to be presented with the reports that have the most significant discrepancies. Document ranking in the broad medical domain have received extensive interest of researchers [8, 13, [15] [16] [17] 21] . However, these efforts focus on conventional query-document retrieval. Our goal is to rank significant discrepancies by measuring the semantic overlap between the initial and final report. There have also been efforts to identify semantic similarity between two texts, e.g., for paraphrase identification [5, 9, 12, 18] , but these approaches operate on the sentence-level, making them unsuitable for documents (e.g., radiology reports).",

We observe that the central challenge of this task is being permissive of surface-level changes (which may be considerable), while emphasizing changes of substance, which may be subtle (see Fig. 1 for examples of such changes). To address this, we incorporate importance and similarity scores. The importance score weights each term/phrase and is learned during training. This score allows for terms that are not important to have less of an impact on the ranking score of the report (e.g., words like well and but). Note that this is a special application in which some function words that are often ignored actually have a big impact on the meaning of a report (e.g., not is often considered a stop word and removed). We let the model learn which terms are important during training. The matching score allows for the model to account for the replacement of similar terms using the cosine distance of word vectors (e.g., averaging and averages are similar) and synonym information from a domain-specific ontology (chauffeur fracture and Hutchinson fracture are synonymous). This allows the replacement of semantically-similar terms to have little impact on the ranking score. We calculate three similarity scores (addition, deletion, and overlap) using the importance and matching scores, and linearly combine them as a ranking score.",

Thus, terms from the final report that do not appear in the preliminary report (i.e., additions) yield a higher score. The deletion score (S d , Eq. 2) is defined similarly, but in terms of the preliminary report; terms from the preliminary report that do not appear in the final report (deletions) yield a higher score. The overlap score (S o , Eq. 3) combines the addition and deletion scores into one succinct measure. We use all three scores to measure term unigram, n-gram, and ontological differences (defined below).

When compared to the best prior work (SimReg [2] ), our model typically yields a considerable improvement in ranking performance. Our method improves R-Prec by 7.4%, nDCG@1 and nDCG@5 performance by 4.5%, and P@5 performance by 4.7%. In 54% of the test cases, our approach improves the nDCG@5 score over SimReg (decreases performance in only 27% of cases). Our model also outperforms leading language model classification approaches (BERT and SciBERT) and a leading neural ranking approach tuned for this task in most metrics (BiPACRR) by up to 15.4% in nDCG@1. We attribute this improved effectiveness of our approach to the explicit modeling of term importance and overlap, which are critical for the task. Ablations. Table 2 shows the ablation study examining the importance of different components in our system. We observe that both contextualization and domain-specificity of the word embeddings improve the performance of our approach. The term importance mechanism improves nDCG@5 by 6.9% and the ontology similarity improves performance by 9.8%. All three similarity measures appear to be important, however the overlap score alone can account for most of the performance (last row in table) . This may be because it succinctly accounts for both additions and deletions.",

We observe that our model considers many radiological conditions as important, both when unmodified between the reports and when added/deleted (e.g., fracture, dislocation, bankart). Judging by the low textual similarity in this example, we conclude that the SimReg model may be relying too heavily on lexical features. We check the terms that are assigned high importance scores across all reports and find the most common are no (12% of reports), cardiopulmonary (3%), process (3%), and abnormality (3%).",
