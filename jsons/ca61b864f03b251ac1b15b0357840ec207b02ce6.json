The SARS-CoV-2 protein also contains eight accessory proteins [14] . Spike protein plays an essential role in binding to receptors and is critical for determining host tropism and transmission capacity. It is functionally divided into S1 domain and S2 domain, responsible for receptor binding and cell membrane fusion respectively. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of \u03b2-CoV is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1 [15] . A team analyzed the cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and found that it has 10 to 20-fold higher binding affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) than SARS-CoV does [16] .",

For patients presenting tachypnea, chest indrawing, or inability to feed or drink, severe pneumonia should be considered. In 10% to 20% of severe patients, the respiratory injury will inevitably develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during 8-14 days of the illness, defined as partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio lower than 300 mmHg, as well as resultant non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and mechanical ventilation [24, 25, 27] . ARDS, as the main cause of respiratory failure, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for developing into severe to critical cases include advanced age, underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease [23, 25, 26] .",

Patients may manifest altered mental status, low oxygen saturation, reduced urine output, weak pulse, cold extremities, low blood pressure, and mottled skin. Besides, patients with acute cardiac injury would present tachycardia or bradycardia. Critically ill ones may also suffer acidosis and increased lactate [23] [24] [25] . Current studies reported the peak value of temperature in non-survivors of COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in survivals during hospitalization [23, 24] . Thus, patients presenting hyperthermia and chill should exclude the possibilities of co-infection with bacteria or other pathogens. Attentions should be paid to prevent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in critical cases and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in those receiving mechanical ventilation. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are also common complications for COVID-19 infection, which increase the risk of hemorrhage and thrombosis. Mottled skin, petechial or purpuric rash, appearance of black stool or hematuresis could be found in some cases. Patients with the syndrome of persistent hypoxemia, chest pain, pre-syncope or syncope, and hemoptysis should be suspected of having pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) [28] . The manifestation of limb pain, swelling, erythema, and dilated superficial veins should be suspected of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Nearly 20% of patients had abnormal coagulation function, and most of severe and critical patients presented coagulation disorders and had the tendency to develop into disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [5, 25, 26] .",

Patients of different severity presented significant different lesions on chest CT (Fig. 1) . Mild patients manifested unilateral and focal ground-glass opacity (GGO) which gradually develops to bilateral or multilobular lesions. As the disease progressed further, GGOs evolved to consolidation lesions, presenting mixpattern or pure consolidation, with the latter being more common in critically ill patients admitted to ICU [5, 25, 32] . Consistent with the interstitial involvement in viral pneumonia, Zhao et al. suggested that 48.5% of CT images manifested reticular patterns, and 28.7% presented interlobular septal thickening [33] . Unlike influenza pneumonia, which usually exhibited unilateral GGO and significant solid nodules, only 6% of COVID-19 patients had solid nodules [32, 34, 35] .

Lymphocytopenia, as one of the most typical laboratory abnormalities, was present in 83.2% of patients, with an even higher proportion in severe ones [24, 26] . In addition, previous studies also revealed that increased Ddimer level and prolonged prothrombin time were also common features of COVID-19, especially for severe patients [24] [25] [26] . Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 might damage liver and myocardium to some extent, showing elevated levels of aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and myoglobin with diverse degrees, as well as increased troponin in critical patients [5, 23, 25] . A few patients had renal dysfunction, presenting increased serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen [5] .",

Only patients presenting ongoing deterioration in oxygenation index, or rapid progression of radiological findings, or excessive activation of immune responses, will be considered to use short-term corticosteroid therapy within 10 days of illness onset. Seven designated hospitals in Zhejiang Province gave patients corticosteroids when they showed increased resting respiratory rate ( > 30 breaths/ minute), drop in oxygen saturation ( < 93%) on room air, or multi-lobular progression ( > 50%) on imaging within 48 h [21] .

For COVID-19 infection, clinical studies have shown that serum levels of inflammatory mediators in severe patients are significantly higher than those in common patients [25] . Excessive immune responses can trigger cytokine storms and cause damage to multiple target organs. Recent guidelines also point that a progressive rise in IL-6 may be a clinical warning indicator for the deterioration of COVID-19. A domestic research team found that tocilizumab can block the signaling pathways of two key inflammatory factors, IL-6 and GM-CSF, and reduce the inflammatory response. A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study has been coducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of moderate patients at high risk to develop into severe and critical patients (registration number: ChiCTR2000029765). For patients with elevated IL-6 levels, the efficacy of tocilizumab can be expected.",

Pathological studies of autopsy showed typical presentations of acute respiratory distress syndrome and involvement of multiple organs. Apart from supportive care, no specific treatment has been established for COVID-19. The efficacy of some promising antivirals, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab needs to be further validated by ongoing clinical trials.",
