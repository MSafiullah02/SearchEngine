The coati (Nasua nasua, Linnaeus, 1766) is a mammal of the Procyonidae family that belongs to South American wildlife and is one of the most common wild animals of Brazilian fauna [3]. This species is included in the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as \u201cLeast Concern (LC)\u201d to the risk of extinction and is not included in the Brazilian list of endangered species [4]. In recent years, the populations of coatis have increased considerably due to the tolerance of the species to anthropogenic disturbances. In urban areas, they find food in the garbage, residences, and parks [5].",

The CPV-2 genome is approximately 5.2 kb and encodes four proteins, two structural (VP1 and VP2/VP3), and two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) [6]. CPV-2 emerged in the mid-1970s as a variant of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) that adapted to the canine host after acquiring mutations, which allowed it to bind to canine transferrin receptor type 1 (TfR), causing a pandemic infection in dogs around the world. However, CPV-2 was quickly replaced with a new highly virulent variant with some nucleotide (nt) changes in the gene encoding the VP2 coat protein, called CPV-2a [10, 11]. Wild carnivores were important as an intermediate host in the evolution of CPV-2 [12]. Raccoon (Procyon lotor), a member of the Procyonidae family, is known to be important in the evolution of CPV-2 to CPV-2a [13]. Despite this, CPV-2 had not yet been found in any other species of the same family. Additional evolutions in dogs were responsible for the generation of two new genetic and antigenic variants, CPV-2b and CPV-2c [11].",

The isolation of a population in a controlled space triggers the increase in inbreeding and consequently leads to an extreme monomorphism; however, this may increase the vulnerability of the animals to infectious diseases [16]. Furthermore, the coexistence between domestic and wild animals has increased in recent decades as a consequence of anthropic impacts, such as ecosystem fragmentation and advances in farming, facilitating the cross-species transmission of viral pathogens [2].",

            "text": "Wild carnivores were essential for the emergence and evolution of CPV-2 because several species are reservoirs of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 [17\u201319]. CPV-2 emerged as a variant of the FPV-like lineage, known to infect wild and domestic animals in the order Carnivora, such as large and small cats, minks, raccoons, and foxes [20]. FPV acquired the capacity to infect domestic dogs after a mutation in the capsid protein (VP2) occurred, giving it the ability to bind to canine transferrin receptor and resulting in the CPV-like lineage [11]. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to be one of the most important wild carnivores in the evolution of CPV-2 [13]. The raccoons are susceptible to FPV and harbor an intermediary virus (Raccoon Parvovirus) between CPV-2 and CPV-2a that was not able to infect dogs. However, after genetic and antigenic variations such as a mutation in VP2 protein (87Leu and 101Thr), which are suspected to be crucial, the CPV-2 variant was replaced by a new highly virulent variant, CPV-2a [13]. Raccoons were reported as not susceptible to CPV-like lineage infections, only to FPV-like lineage infections [21]; however, recent studies have reported the isolation of CPV-2 in this species [19, 22]. Thus, although the importance of raccoons as key hosts in the evolution of CPV is known, until now no other member of the Procyonidae family is known to be susceptible to FPV-like lineage or CPV-like lineage infections.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of CPV-2b in asymptomatic free-living coatis. Until now, only a member of the Procyonidae family, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), was reported to be susceptible to CPV-2 infection [19, 22]. However, the CPV found in coatis (CPV-2b) is different from that in raccoons. CPV-2b is considered a common subtype detected in the world population of domestic dogs in recent years, including in Brazil [7]. Studies have shown a positive relationship between the subtype circulating among dogs and wild animals, reinforcing the importance of domestic dogs as reservoirs of the virus for wild animal infection [18, 19].",
