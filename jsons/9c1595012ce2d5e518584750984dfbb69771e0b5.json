Unlike humans, modification of germ cells of animals, insects, and plants are much less controversial and occurring routinely, in some cases in the commercial sector. For example, Sangamo uses another genome editing tool (specifically, zinc finger nucleases) to produce hornless dairy cows, making milking less dangerous for farmers [41, 42] . The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is investing $35 million into CRISPR-enabled gene drives in mosquitoes as part of its initiatives to control the spread of malaria-causing plasmodia [43] .

Small changes generally occur as part of the normal cycle of fundamental and applied research wherein new discoveries lead to new scientific questions or knowledge. Larger changes tend to occur when new fields of science, disciplines, or conceptual frameworks are combined (often referred to as convergence in science). Recent examples include additive biomanufacturing, which combines technologies of 3D printing with development of \"ink\" made of living cells [24] ; synthetic biology (i.e., combining DNA-based \"circuits\" to create an organism of known function), which bring engineering and computer science concepts to the field of biology; and systems biology, which involves advanced data analytics and visualization (often considered big data analytics) to study connections and networks within and between molecules, pathways, cells, physiological systems, and life forms. In addition, transformative changes could result from trial-and-error during the discovery process or through careful observation of biological systems. Examples of these changes include genetic engineering, which was enabled by the discovery of proteins that cut DNA internally (called endonucleases), and CRISPR-based genome editing, which emerged from research on immune responses in bacteria.",

These concerns often stem from surprise about the development of new technologies and knowledge gained that could be used to cause physical, social, economic, and/or political harms to a country. However, technologies rarely arise without warning. Scientific publication, patent applications, conferences, and online media and blogs shed light on near-term advances taking place within scientific fields and disciplines. Through these resources, security experts can learn about cutting-edge research and applications to address health, agriculture, energy, and other societal needs. Identifying larger changes that occur through the integration and/or leveraging of advances from distinct fields involves an evaluation of technical challenges and/or gaps limiting benefits to social needs, technical challenges that stall advancement within fields, and scientific advances in different fields. For example, 3D bioprinting came about as a result of increasing need for tissues and organs for research (e.g., in vitro testing of drug candidates) and clinical purposes (e.g., more effective tissue or organ transplantation), advances in stem cell research and tissue engineering, and advances in additive manufacturing [46] . Another example is neuroprosthetics, which has developed from the need to improve the lives of service members and other individuals who have lost limbs, increasing knowledge in neuroscience, and advances in material science involved in the development of prosthetic limbs [47, 48] . Still another example is the field of precision medicine, which is enabled by improved individualized health care, increasing collection of biological and health data, and new computational analysis and data storage technologies [49] . The convergence of science and new technology development often are driven by beneficial purposes and social need. Continued examination of these needs and scientific activities can prevent or limit the technology surprise that often elicits concern from the security community.",

A few examples have emerged during the past decade highlighting this phenomenon. One example is the emergence of synthetic biology as a new field of study. At its surface, synthetic biology is genetic engineering. It involves joining together specific DNA sequences to produce a certain biological outcome. But what distinguishes synthetic biology from traditional genetic engineering is the conceptual approach to designing, building, and testing of biological systems. The concept of synthetic biology was created by engineers and computer scientists who asked whether biological systems could be assembled using specific parts to generate expected outcomes. The synthetic biology approach involves the identification of individual \"parts\", which functionally are DNA (specifically, plasmids containing genes with desired functions), that when placed in a particular order, could produce a desired outcome such as creating organisms that produce small molecules (e.g., synthetic artemisinin for malaria treatment [50] , chemicals [51] , opioids [52] ), or creating bacteria in all the colors of the rainbow [53]. This design-based approach enables new applications in health, agriculture, industry, and national security.",

This use of DNA is driven by the increasing need for platforms that can store extremely large data and datasets. The concept of DNA-based storage emerged from the recognition that the human genome, which is 3 billion base pairs long, can store a lot of information stably and with relatively high fidelity for thousands of years. DNA-based storage leverages advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis technologies. The concept that image data can be stored in and retrieved from DNA was demonstrated in 2017, when scientists from Harvard University published their work on using CRISPR-based tools to encode image data of a galloping horse in bacteria [54, 55] . This effort leverages genome editing tools to demonstrate the feasibility of DNA-based storage of data. The use of DNA as a data storage medium also may present new, potentially exploitable, vulnerability. In 2017, scientists described their ability to hack computers via sequences they embedded into DNA [56] . The researchers claimed to encode \"malicious software\" in \"DNA they purchased online,\" which they used \"to gain 'full control' over a computer that tried to process\" or analyze the sequence data generated from physically sequencing the purchased DNA [56] .",

For example, next generation sequencers and data analysis software allow scientists to collect information about host response following exposures to pathogens or hazardous chemicals, the microbiome that supports normal growth and functioning of the human body, the organisms in the environment, and many other molecules associated with the normal state of the human body and potential risk factors of exposure to chemical or biological hazards. These data can inform surveillance efforts to help determine whether and when a natural or man-made incident has occurred, aiding both detection of potentially harmful incidents and forensic analysis. In addition, the data may inform the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tools against chemical and biological agents [called medical countermeasures (MCMs)] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Another examples include the use of synthetic genomics, which is the chemical synthesis of genomic DNA of organisms, as platform methods for rapid development of vaccines against epidemic pathogens. Synthetic biology is being used to create technology platforms for rapid MCM development against pathogens and for synthesis of pharmaceutical products. Similar technologies can be used to prevent, detect, and respond to incidents involving contamination or infection of animals and agriculturally-important plants. In addition, synthetic biology is being used to develop biological systems that \"eat\" nerve agent [62, 63] , clean up contaminated materials [61] , and exert biocontrol in the environment [64, 65] . These efforts are being aided by advances in genome editing, laboratory automation, high-throughput experimental procedures, bioinformatics, and other technologies that improve repeatability and reduce human error during experimentation.",

The U.S. government passed a series of laws and issued presidential directives in rapid succession to enhance its ability to anticipate, prevent, detect, prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist events. Several of these programs were further enhanced to prevent, detect, and respond to naturally-occurring infectious disease and natural disasters. ",

These investments involved several complementary activities, including basic research, advanced development, regulatory science, and development of product platforms. These efforts required coordination and communication between the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and newly created programs for advanced development such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which was established in 2006 by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (USC109 \u00a7417). Together, these efforts support fundamental research that provides the scientific foundation for rational design and pre-clinical testing of vaccines and drugs, research to develop and/or validate the animal models and safety and efficacy data used to inform product approval by the FDA (often referred to as regulatory science research), and research that supports testing and evaluation of product efficacy in animal models. These efforts focus on developing and maintaining MCMs for use by civilians and first responders in an emergency.",

Having vaccines and drugs against biological agents that may affect a sizable number of the military and/or be used on the battlefield is a priority for the DoD and has resulted in research, development, and manufacturing investments to support this defensive need. In 2006, DoD created the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) to leverage scientific advances and technology innovation to counter genetically-engineered biological weapons [67, 68] . The TMTI program supported the development of several vaccine and drug candidates, including 2 products against hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses that reached the Investigational New Drug (IND) stage of the FDA approval process, preparation of 2 INDs for broad spectrum antibiotics, 3 broad-spectrum antibiotics, and 20 additional candidates in early research and development. In addition, TMT had begun examining FDA-approved antibiotics for activity against non-biothreat diseases [69] . In 2010, TMTI moved under the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) [70] . In addition to this program, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JSTO-CBD) supports research on MCMs against biological threats at DoD research facilities (i.e., under the Army's Medical Research and Materiel Command [71] ) and at the nongovernmental research institutions [72] . The Joint Project Manager for Medical Countermeasure Systems, which is overseen by the DoD JPEO-CBD office, has issued calls for development of countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats [73] . More recently, the DoD launched the Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, which is a joint effort between DoD and Nanotherapeutics Inc. that provides advanced development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals [74] .",

BioCaster uses text mining technologies to scan RSS newsfeeds from local and national news in Japan to detect keywords related to infectious disease incidents [93] .

Argus, which no longer exists, and HealthMap were/ are moderated by people. Argus was established to detect the emergence, illnesses, and person-to-person transmission of avian H5N1 influenza A virus [94] . Argus used a variety of data analysis technologies and human analysis to examine and monitor media reports on potential health security incidents. HealthMap was created to collect, integrate, and analyze a variety of data that may indicate a disease outbreak and enable ongoing monitoring and surveillance of infectious disease threats. Users can access and visualize data of interest by applying filters of data sources [95] . A retrospective analysis of the efficacy of HealthMap at detecting the 2014-2016 Western African Ebolavirus outbreak found that the system had identified cases of viral hemorrhagic fever a week before the WHO declared the outbreak [96] . Whether this system can be used to provide public health officials with predictive, actionable information is unclear, especially because the viral hemorrhagic fever cases identified by the platform do not appear to have led to outbreak response. An evaluation of these systems concluded that their efficacies are influenced by involvement of human moderation, sources of data, languages of the collected information, the regions in which incidents occur, and the types of cases collected [97] .",

In addition, the U.S. government established several systems to obtain early warning of potential infectious disease outbreaks, allocating about $32 billion dollars between 2001 and 2012 [98] . DoD supported the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE), which was a system of systems integrating reportable disease surveillance, sentinel surveillance, syndromic surveillance, and clinical identification [99] . This system sought to detect natural and/or man-made outbreaks through the identification of abnormal trends in the data. ESSENCE involved cooperation between the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Emergency Medical Associates of New Jersey Research Foundation, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. In 2003, the CDC created BioSense to enable early detection and assessment of potential illnesses that may be related to bioterrorism incidents [100] . Through this system, the CDC sought to build the capabilities of state and local public health departments to conduct syndromic surveillance. Today, the program is called the National Syndromic Surveillance Program and enables the collection, evaluation, sharing, and storage of health information via a cloud-based system [101] . The CDC also created the Early Warning Infectious Disease Surveillance system, which sought to enhance detection and reporting of transboundary infectious diseases outbreaks with Canada and Mexico [102] . In 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) after passage of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act [103] . The NBIC integrates and analyzes animal, plant, human, and environmental health data to improve early warning of potential biological incidents and gain situational awareness [104] . Although NBIC was created from a need to detect potential bioterrorism incidents, the Center now includes natural events that may cause significant disruption to the U.S. [105] . In 2012, the DoD invested in the Biosurveillance Ecosystem, which is a cloud-based platform that enables users to plug in data-specific applications to detect anomalies in human and animal infectious disease events [106] . In addition, the platform enables collaboration among users and incorporates advanced data analytics, such as machine learning of health and non-health data. The concept for this platform emerged from the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, which caught many by surprise [107] .",

            "text": "Building of these efforts and recognizing the benefits of identifying potentiallydevastating infectious events, President Obama issued the National Strategy for Biosurveillance in 2012 [108] . This Strategy had three primary objectives: (1) to \"integrate and enhance national biosurveillance efforts\" to provide decision-makers with timely information in a crisis; (2) to increase the network of national expertise and capabilities for rapid detection and understanding (i.e., situational awareness) of emerging crises; and (3) to implement new approaches for considering and addressing uncertainty in the decision-making process. Included as core functions are environmental scanning; integration of human, animal, and plant health information; and assessment and forecasting of potential consequences. One month prior to the Strategy's release, the U.S. government established an interagency working group on science and technology for biosurveillance, which was chaired by the White House Office and Science and Technology Policy and DoD. This working group was tasked with developing the research and development priorities for achieving the core functions of the National Strategy for Biosurveillance. The working group discussion culminated in the release of the National Biosurveillance Science and Technology Roadmap in 2013, which defined the key priorities for detecting unusual or above-baseline events, anticipating risk including assessment of the potential consequences of incidents, identification and characterization of threats to human health, and integration of, analysis of, and information-sharing with key decision-makers, responders, and healthcare providers. The roadmap highlights current national activities in each of these areas and identifies capability needs to achieve the described priorities. The priorities encompassed the production of baseline data of natural or man-made human, animal, plant, and environmental health events; assessment of emergence and disease dynamics; development of rapid detection and diagnosis technologies and systems; and improvements in sharing, integration, and communication of biosurveillance data. This strategy and roadmap provided a framework for enhancing U.S. capabilities for early warning of natural and/or man-made biological events, which could be leveraged for detection and early warning against chemical, radiological, nuclear, and environmental incidents.",

To support early research, build scientific expertise, and provide ready capability in a bioterrorism or public health emergency, NIH invested in Regional and National Biocontainment Laboratories and in research and training consortia through their newly established Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases [110, 111] . NIH priorities primarily focused on developing specialized knowledge and skill for studying biological agents on the Category A and B Priority Pathogen lists [112] , which initially did not require the use of emerging biotechnologies. However, more recent research efforts have begun exploring synthetic biology, systems biology and data science, microfluidic technologies, tissues-on-a-chip, and other methodologies that offer new capabilities for studying host-pathogen responses and developing, testing, and validating diagnostic tools and MCMs. For example, NIH supported a Modeling Immunity for Biodefense program in which immunologists, computational biologists, modelers, and microbiologists worked together to model the immunological responses to infection and vaccination [113] . Other examples include the applications of next generation sequencing to characterize newly emerging pathogens using microfluidic technologies [114] and lab-on-a-chip systems for monitoring pathogens in various samples, including environmental samples [115] . In addition, research programs supporting metagenomic studies for examining host-pathogen responses are leveraged to understand biological threat agents better [116] .",

The RAPIDD program supported international teams of researchers to develop community-based and/or environmental models and to generate and/or collect the necessary data to study infectious disease dynamics. Some models integrated clinical data with data on local population migration, and hospital location and capacity. Other models focused on the existence of specific pathogens (e.g., viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers) in wild animals throughout the world, the migration patterns of the animals, and the interactions between the animals and people. Some of these models include data on disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, to study the spread and potential risk of vectorborne diseases. In addition to these modeling efforts, the RAPIDD program includes opportunities to translate these models to decision-makers responsible for public health emergencies of international consequence. In the early-2010s, the U.S. and U.K. entered into a collaboration to support research for combatting zoonoses (i.e., infectious diseases that infect both humans and animals) in low-income countries [121] .

Leading up to the creation of the EPT program were several outbreaks (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, H5N1 influenza from 1997 to present day, and H1N1 influenza in 2009) that emerged unexpectedly, resulting in international concern. This program supports multi-sector teams to implement projects to predict, prevent, identify, and respond to infectious disease threats. The Predict project involves capacity building for strengthening detection and monitoring of, characterizing the drivers for, and improving predictive models for disease transmission between wildlife and people. The Prevent project involves assessment of the risks of associated with disease transmission and strategies to mitigate those risks. The Identify project involves the building laboratory capacity, including training personnel, to diagnose infectious diseases in animals and people. The Respond project involves facilitating networks of public health, veterinary medicine, and environmental health to improve transdisciplinary training and response efforts. In addition to these projects, the EPT program funds CDC to promote the detection and monitoring of zoonotic diseases, including providing support for the Field Epidemiology Training Program.",

Microbial forensics and attribution was included in Presidential level strategy for biodefense in the early part of the 21st century, specifically in Homeland Security Presidential Directive-10, Biodefense for the 21st Century. A significant investment towards microbial forensics was the establishment of the National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC), which is part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasure Center [129] . NBFAC has achieved certification of ISO standards enabling it to provide laboratory support for federal law enforcement investigations that involve biological agents [130] . NBFAC works closely with the FBI and relevant U.S. government agencies on specific cases that warrant sample analysis for agent identification, sample signatures, and attribution. In addition, NBFAC conducts forensic research to address capability gaps to enhance its support for biocriminal and bioterrorism investigations. In addition, the National Institute of Justice of the Department of Justice has provided funding since 2011 for research on application of microbiome research to forensic data collection and analysis [131] . This funding program leverages recent research on the microbiome, which receives significant funding from the NIH. In 2014, the National Research Council (NRC) published a report on scientific needs for microbial forensics [132] . Drawing on the recent advances in cloud computing, data collection, and data analytics, the NRC report primarily focused the potential for bioinformatics, whole genome sequencing, and systems biology analyses to enhance microbial forensic capabilities internationally.",

This approach draws on studies correlating infectious disease infection, transmission, and emergence in the human population with temperature, humidity, urbanization and city expansion, night lights, local migration, and other environmental and human factors. These data, along with satellite imagery, can be used to identify conditions conducive for pathogen outbreaks. In addition, geolocation data embedded in videos, pictures, and text files can be used to tag the location and time of infection events. In 2009, scientists described the use of satellite imagery to identify climate events (e.g., flooding) with outbreaks of waterborne disease (e.g., cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and leptospirosis) [144] . They leveraged published research correlating outbreaks of these diseases with societal changes caused by flooding, including overcrowding and lack of sanitation and clean water. The scientists argued that coupling knowledge about human factors with factors observable by satellite imagery also could be used to predict movement of vectors with the emergence and spread of vector-borne diseases. Another research group examined the correlation between malaria incidence and climatic data (i.e., rainfall estimates, vegetation levels, and surface temperature of the land) collected through satellites [145] . More recently, researchers described the use of satellite imagery to monitor nighttime lights to examine the pattern of measles cases in Western Africa [146] . These scientists used nighttime lights as a surrogate for population density, which affects pathogen transmission, to predict outbreaks of measles.",

In 2014, the White House released a report on Strengthening Forensic Science, which highlighted capabilities and implementation challenges for accreditation and certification of forensic science and workforce development of medical and legal personnel [149] . In 2016, the White House issued three reports highlighting S&T needs for disaster preparedness, reduction, and resilience, including The National Preparedness Science and Technology Task Force Report: Identifying Science and Technology Opportunities for National Preparedness [150] , The Implementation Roadmap for the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Research and Development Plan [151] , and The Homeland Biodefense Science and Technology Capability Review [152] . The Task Force Report highlighted preparedness initiatives that could benefit from advances in S&T. The Implementation Roadmap enumerated the research and development activities that enhance security and resilience of critical infrastructure. The biodefense capability review highlighted the S&T needs for countering biological threats affecting human and animal health. The Homeland Security Biodefense Science and Technology Capability Review described the results of an interagency process to identify science and technology needs to meet critical biodefense objectives in threat awareness, surveillance and detection, and recovery [152] . The report highlighted the critical needs for: (a) enhancing U.S. risk assessment methodologies; (b) conducting threat characterization research (including assessing the consequences of a deliberate attack on pets and wildlife); (c) examining transmission through food and water; (d) studying avian influenza; (e) linking biosurveillance data to improve decision-making in a biological incident; (f) improving sampling, detection, and surveillance of environmental samples after an attack; (g) improving forensic analysis of a biological incident; (h) enhancing research and laboratory capacity during a crisis to inform modeling of biological attacks; (i) improving MCM shelf-life, production, and storage; (j) enhancing workforce development of responders to biological attacks; and (k) developing innovative decontamination methods. This list of science and technology needs for biodefense highlights the general need for workforce development, research support, and information-sharing with policy-makers. Some of these needs were addressed by the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy, which calls for research and development in a variety of areas important for preventing, detecting, and responding to natual and man-made biological threats [153] .",

            "text": "Common to these documents are the recognized need for a proficient workforce, data sharing and communication with other scientists and decision-makers, and research and development to increase knowledge and develop new technologies and methodologies. However, a significant challenge seems to be the translation of operational or strategic need to specific research requirements that can be used to generate information and develop new products. Shortly after 2001, the U.S. government, philanthropic organizations, and universities supported research, education, and communication efforts. In the early 2010s, interest in continuing these efforts waned as time has progressed without the occurrence of a major biological attack. However, during the past few years, particularly since the 2014-2016 Western African Ebolavirus and 2016 Zika virus outbreaks, concern about catastrophic natural and man-made threats have met with renewed interest in funding research on risk assessment, prediction of future infectious disease threats, trends in biotechnology (specifically, horizon scanning 1 ), and decontamination. This increased interest in research has not necessarily been met with increased investment in education and training. Although a few formal, degree-granting programs in biodefense have existed, the only known programs that exist today are the Biohazardous Threat Agents and Emerging Infectious Diseases of Georgetown University [154] and Masters in Biodefense at George Mason University [155] . Furthermore, the number of universities that provide laboratory biosecurity training to graduate students in the life sciences has decreased during the past decade, but in their place programs through educational service providers, such as CITI [156] , have emerged. In addition, the American Biological Safety Association provides laboratory biosafety and biosecurity training to biosafety professionals [157] the International Federation of Biosafety Associations has a certification program for biorisk management (i.e., methods for analyzing and managing accidental and deliberate biological risks) [158] , three organizations host leadership in biosecurity or health security programs [159] [160] [161] , and the U.S. government supports training activities. Despite these efforts, most scientists are not taught about biosecurity or biodefense issues (the exceptions are researchers working with Biological Select Agents and Toxins or in synthetic biology). This lack of training results in scientists who may not be able to evaluate the broader impact of their research, whether that impact is increased risk of research activities or enhanced benefits to meet national security needs. Without such knowledge, scientists and engineers may not be able to identify and transition knowledge or technologies that can address outstanding biodefense needs, or to identify potential risks associated with their research. This difficulty is pronounced with pathogen research compared to research that does not involve pathogens (e.g., creating synthetic organisms to develop platforms for synthetic antimicrobial products). However, the ability to translate biodefense needs to research projects appears to be more challenging than similar capabilities for translating needs to improve human health, agriculture, or environmental health.",

            "text": "Overcoming these challenges requires a system in which decision-makers are able to convey their needs to funding organizations, which in turn need to convey their needs to the scientific and engineering communities. To be successful, this system requires creativity at all stages to identify solutions that address particular needs and leverage the capabilities generated by advances in physics, chemistry, engineering, material science, computer science, social and behavioral sciences, and the life sciences. Promoting creativity is harder than it appears, often requiring researchers and decision-makers to think differently than they were taught. For example, many scientists, especially life scientists, approach research from a discovery science standpoint, i.e., they develop and test hypotheses to generate knowledge, create new products (e.g., high-throughput drug discovery and pre-clinical vaccine development), and/or develop new technologies to improve research efforts or as product platforms. On the other end of the spectrum are engineers, who often conduct design-based research, which involves identifying the specific product needs before developing the methodological approach to achieve the desired output (e.g., synthetic organisms designed to produce industrial chemicals). Both approaches enable innovation within fields and sometimes across fields, but they also may contribute to conceptual barriers to identifying solutions from high-level need. This challenge may be exacerbated for decision-makers whose area of expertise is not research and consequently, may have trouble defining product specifications from the strategic or operational needs.",

This level of awareness-raising can be achieved through training or fellowship opportunities, conferences and symposia, collaborative grants, and/or challenge competitions. In addition, these workforce development opportunities could be enhanced further by including biodefense topics and needs in training curricula and other engagement venues. The goal of these efforts would be to impart the necessary knowledge to the scientific and engineering communities about the critical needs in biodefense that emerging biotechnologies may be able to address. Through these training and career development opportunities, scientists and engineers may gain the necessary knowledge about the problems that need addressing, previously-attempted approaches, and willingness for transitioning new technologies. Furthermore, they may be better positioned to identify which information and technologies may be most effective for addressing a given biodefense need.",

Although some decision-makers are examining cutting-edge biotechnologies to harness their capabilities for biodefense purposes, many largely are unaware of the benefits afforded by these technologies. In fact, several security experts and decision-makers view emerging biotechnology more as a risk than benefit and consider the realization of risky outcomes to be more plausible that the realization of benefit. This attitude prevents decision-makers and security experts, alike, from seeing the potential of biology and biotechnology for addressing unaddressed capability gaps. Educational efforts directed towards raising awareness of current and near future technology trends and their application to other fields may help decision-makers understand which technologies can be leveraged, which require further investment, and which have associated legal, ethical, and social barriers limiting their application.",

Understanding and leveraging newlydeveloped capabilities afforded by emerging biotechnologies require knowledge about cutting-edge research and its real or proposed application(s) to analogous needs, the process through which biotechnologies advance, and the educational and research infrastructure that promotes multi-disciplinary science. When combined with knowledge about biodefense gaps that could be addressed through science and technology, creative scientists, engineers, and decision-makers can design research agendas or concepts based on the identified gaps and S&T needs, and that leverage emerging biotechnologies. Innovation in research and technology development are driven by sector-specific needs and the convergence of the physical, chemical, material, computer, engineering, and life sciences. Biotechnologies developed for other sectors could be applied to biodefense, especially if the individuals involved are able to innovate in concept design and development. Of all biodefense objectives, biosurveillance seems to have reaped the most benefit from emerging biotechnologies, specifically the integration and analysis of diverse clinical, biological, demographic, and other relevant data. More recently, scientists have begun applying synthetic biology, genomics, and microfluidics to development of new products and platforms for MCMs. Unlike these initiatives, investments in microbial forensics have been few, limiting its ability to leverage biotechnology advances for collecting and analyzing data. Looking to the future, emerging biotechnologies can provide new opportunities for enhancing biodefense by addressing capability gaps.",

Today, biodefense efforts cover threat characterization, risk assessment, MCM research and development, protection of laboratory workers from accidental exposures, detection and surveillance of infectious disease, emergency response, forensics, and protection of public health, agriculture, and health care critical infrastructures. This section highlights biodefense activities that were initiated after 2001, subsequent policy changes associated with those activities, and their science and technology needs.",

This discussion occurred within the context of the 2014-2016 Ebolavirus disease outbreak and the Global Health Security Agenda (launched in 2014), and leveraged Dr. Hayman and Wood's expertise and research on the existence of viral hemorrhagic fevers.",
