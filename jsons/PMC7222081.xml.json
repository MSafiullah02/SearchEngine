Furthermore, rotavirus can also be dangerous for patients of other age groups. Over 90% of all infection cases are caused by rotavirus A strains [2]. The great serological diversity of rotavirus A strains is a serious problem for vaccine development. The currently existing vaccines against rotavirus infection are live attenuated vaccines for peroral administration. However, they have certain shortcomings, such as the risk of reversion to pathogenicity or the appearance of novel vaccine-associated reassortants of the virus, as well as the risk of intussusception (a serious complication caused by peroral vaccine administration) [3, 4]. In this context, development of a recombinant vaccine against rotavirus A that could be administered perorally is a topical issue.",

The inner layer is made of VP2 dimers, the intermediate layer is made of VP6 trimers, and the outer layer is composed of VP7 trimers and VP4 trimers, which form spikes. For the virus to enter a host cell, VP4 has to undergo proteolysis, producing VP5* and VP8* fragments [5]. The major rotavirus antigens are VP6, VP7, VP5*, and VP8*. The available data indicate that the structural protein VP6 is highly conserved: 87% of its amino acid sequence is invariable in group A strains [6]. VP6 plays a central role in the development of the specific immune response: the major antibodies produced in response to a natural rotavirus infection are specific to VP6. It was shown that the RLSFQLMRPPNMTP epitope of VP6 can activate a strong protective immune response comparable to the response induced by immunization with full-size VP6 [7]. For this reason, this epitope can be considered a promising candidate to be included in recombinant vaccines against rotavirus.",

            "text": "There exist different strategies for the development of recombinant vaccines. For anti-rotavirus vaccines, the major approaches are recombinant subunit vaccines containing individual rotavirus proteins, and vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of rotavirus proteins or proteins of other viruses [3]. In particular, it seems promising to obtain VLPs based on coat proteins of plant viruses, which are safe for humans, possess strong immunostimulating properties, and can be obtained cost-effectively [8]. One plant virus with immunostimulating properties is Alternanthera mosaic virus (AltMV) [9]. AltMV belongs to the Potexvirus genus of the Alphaflexiviridae family. AltMV virions have a filamentous shape, being 570 nm long and 13.5 nm in diameter [10]. The AltMV Coat protein (CP) is composed of 207 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 22 kDa; it can form filamentous virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro in absence of RNA. In our previous work [11], it was shown that these VLPs, similarly to AltMV virions, exhibit adjuvant properties. AltMV VLPs are 15.2 nm in diameter, range in length from 60 to 2000 nm, and are stable under physiological conditions [10, 12]. Thus, AltMV CP can be considered a promising carrier of foreign epitopes (antigenic determinants) for the development of recombinant vaccines.",

The nucleotide sequence encoding recombinant AltMV CP fused to the epitope of rotavirus protein VP6 was obtained using a template of a plasmid carrying a cDNA copy of the AltMV genome (strain MU) (GenBank: FJ822136.1) [13]. The nucleotide sequence encoding AltMV CP was optimized for expression in a bacterial system; for this purpose, codons rarely occurring in Escherichia coli were replaced with those typical for these cells (https://www.genscript.com/ tools/codon-frequency-table). The forward primer 5'\u2011ATACTCATGAGTACTCCATTTCCTCAAGTCACCCAGGAACAGATTGAC-3' containing a PagI recognition site and the reverse primer 5'-GTATGGATCCCGGCGTCATGTTCGGCGGGCGCATCAGT-TGGAATGACAAACGCTCCGGTGGTGGGAGGTATTG-3', which contained the nucleotide sequence encoding the epitope of VP6 and a BamHI site, were utilized to obtain a nucleotide sequence encoding AltMV CP fused to the rotaviral epitope at the C-terminus. All genetic engineering procedures with recombinant DNA were performed using conventional techniques [14]. Recombinant DNA encoding AltMV CP fused to the epitope of VP6 was cleaved with PagI and BamHI restriction endonucleases (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) at the corresponding sites and ligated into a pQE-60 vector (QIAGEN) with T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas, Lithuania). The obtained plasmid was used to transform E. coli cells of the SG[pREP4] strain. After the expression was induced, recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Germany) with 6 \u041c guanidine chloride and 8 M urea as described in a handbook [15]. The preparation was dialyzed against Milli-Q deionized water (Merck Millipore, United States) exchanged hourly for 4 h.",

For this purpose, AltMV RNA was incubated with native AltMV CP (control), ER6, or with a mixture of both proteins. The proportions between the amounts of RNA and proteins (AltMV CP and/or ER6) used to obtain RNPs had been optimized in our previous study where RNPs of another potexvirus, potato virus X, were obtained [17, 18]. Using a gel retardation assay, it was found that RNPs of different molecular weights were formed in a mixture of AltMV RNA with AltMV CP and ER6. Subsequent analysis by electron microscopy confirmed the presence of particles of different lengths and morphology resembling AltMV virions. For the mixtures where AltMV RNA was incubated with each of the proteins individually, the gel retardation assay revealed that the material was held up at the start of the gel. Data from our previous experiments suggest that the presence of histidine residues can lead to nonspecific aggregation of recombinant proteins with RNA [20]. This may explain the observation that RNA incubated with recombinant protein ER6 was retained in the gel at the start level. Electron microscopy showed that under conditions of RNP formation, AltMV CP produced long filamentous VLPs, which is consistent with the previously published data [12]. Under the selected conditions, addition of RNA did not affect the degree of AltMV CP polymerization. It can be supposed that long filamentous VLPs mechanically prevented RNA from advancing in the gel. However, incubation of AltMV RNA with ER6 produced, along with aggregates, a certain number of structures with the morphology of VLP conglomerates (Fig. 3e), which were absent in the RNA-free ER6 specimen. These structures probably represent the products of specific interaction between recombinant ER6 and viral RNA. Therefore, it can be concluded that ER6 interacts with viral RNA but this interaction does not result in RNP formation. At the same time, incubation of AltMV RNA with both proteins simultaneously (ER6 and AltMV CP) gave rise to RNPs of different lengths and morphology resembling AltMV virions; apparently, they were generated by mosaic assembly. Interestingly, addition of ER6 to RNA and AltMV CP prevented the formation of extremely long AltMV VLPs. Analysis of RNPs obtained by incubation of ER6, AltMV CP, and AltMV RNA using immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus A confirmed that the resulting RNPs contained chimeric ER6, which retained its antigenic specificity within RNPs. ER6 aggregates with RNA also interacted with polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus A. Previously, we showed that AltMV and AltMV VLPs comparable to virions in size have a pronounced immunostimulating potential [11]. Therefore, it is RNPs obtained by interaction of RNA with both AltMV CP and ER6 that represent most potential for development of a vaccine prototype.",
