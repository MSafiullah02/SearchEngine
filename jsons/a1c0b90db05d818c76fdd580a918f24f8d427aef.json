A simple model was proposed by assuming a monopole condensation, where composite SIMP comes from a \"strongly interacting\" U(1) d gauge theory. In the original model, the DM relic abundance is determined by the 3 \u2192 2 annihilation process via the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In this letter, we discuss that the DM relic abundance is naturally determined also by a semi-annihilation process via a kinetic mixing between the hypercharge gauge boson and the dark U(1) d gauge boson (dark photon). The dark photon can be discovered by LDMX-style missing momentum experiments in the near future.",

We should also note the null results in directdetection experiments of dark matter (DM), which may indicate that the mass of DM is not of order the electroweak or TeV scale. We therefore focus on the case in which the DM mass is in a sub-GeV region, which can be tested via rare events rather than by a direct production from high-energy particles. Among proposed highintensity accelerators, the Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) [1] is designed to measure missing momentum in high-rate electron fixed-target reactions and can be a powerful discovery tool for such a light DM particle.",

            "text": "From the perspective of cosmology, the stronglyinteracting massive particle (SIMP) proposed in Refs. [2, 3] naturally fits sub-GeV DM. They pointed out that the relic abundance of sub-GeV DM is consistent with the observed value if the 3 \u2192 2 annihilation process dominates at the time of freeze-out of DM and its cross section is determined by the mass scale of DM with an O(1) coupling. SIMPs can be naturally realized by composite particles like pions. The 3 \u2192 2 annihilation process is actually realized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in the low-energy dark sector. Interestingly, the model predicts a self-interaction cross section of DM which is potentially favored by the observations of small-scale structure in cosmology [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] (see Ref. [9] for a review). This is dubbed as the SIMP miracle. However, there is a difficulty in maintaining thermal equilibrium between the dark and visible sectors during the freeze-out of the 3 \u2192 2 annihi-lation process, which is required for the SIMP miracle to work. This can be realized in rather complicated models like the ones proposed in Refs. [10] [11] [12] (see Refs. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] for recent works).",

[20] , we have proposed a simple model of the SIMP, where the composite DM \"pions\" consist of darksector \"electrons\" and \"positrons\" connected by a U(1) d gauge interaction rather than a strong non-Abelian gauge interaction. We introduce a fundamental \"monopole\" for U(1) d at a high-energy scale and assume a \"monopole\" condensation at the sub-GeV scale. One cannot write down the Lagrangian of this kind of theory including both a \"monopole\" and an \"electron\". However, this does not mean that the theory does not exist. In fact, theories with \"monopoles\" and \"electrons\" have been extensively studied in N = 2 [21] [22] [23] [24] and N = 1 supersymmetry [25] [26] [27] [28] without specifying the Lagrangian. In this letter, we revisit our SIMP model and propose a scenario in which the DM relic abundance is determined by a 2 \u2192 2 semi-annihilation process via the kinetic mixing between the U(1) d gauge boson and U(1) Y gauge boson rather than the 3 \u2192 2 annihilation process. The model is quite economical [29] ; we do not need to introduce any other particles but just introduce dark-sector \"electrons\", a \"monopole\", and the U(1) d gauge boson (dark photon), the latter of which plays the roles of confinement and mediator to the visible sector. Although the SIMP miracle does not work in this scenario, the model is simple and all small dimensionless parameters are expected to be naturally small due to non-trivial anomalous dimensions.",

            "text": "Finally, we comment on a mixing between the \"monopole\" \u03c6 and the SM Higgs field H below the Higgs and \"monopole\" condensation scales via a quartic interaction of |\u03c6| 2 |H| 2 . There is a strong collider constraint on the mixing parameter from the Higgs-decay channel into two \"monopoles\" [54] . The \"monopoles\" can decay into muons after they are produced from the Higgs decay [55] . In this case, the branching ratio of the Higgs decay into the \"monopoles\" must be smaller than about 1% [56] , which requires that the above quartic coupling must be smaller than of order 10 \u22123 . Such a small coupling may be naturally realized in our model because our model may be conformal above the \"monopole\" and \"electron\" mass scale and the \"monopole\" has a relatively large anomalous dimension [23, 24] . The search for the Higgs decay into muons may also be an interesting direction to test our model in the near future.",
