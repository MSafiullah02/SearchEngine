Once red blood cells, neurons, myocardiocytes (heart muscle cells, also known as cardiomyocytes), and many other varieties develop they remain as those same types of cells for the rest of their existence. Cells that have reached the end-stage of their development and are no longer able to divide are called \u201cterminally differentiated.\u201d[1] For example, a red blood cell ultimately loses its nucleus and thus its ability to reproduce. Mature neurons and myocardiocytes , while retaining their nuclei, are also thought to not divide in adults. Myocardiocytes do, however, increase significantly in size from birth to adulthood, thus increasing the overall dimensions of the heart.",

The hope is that at least some of these other methods will be safer regarding the risk of developing cancer. Methods that do not result in integration of new genetic material into the cell\u2019s DNA are considered safer than ones that do. However, it is still possible that they too might produce enough genetic and epigenetic changes to make the resulting iPSCs more susceptible to creating tumors rather than healthy differentiated cells. Moreover, most non-integrating methods are significantly less efficient at producing iPSCs than the original ones using retroviruses, although newer techniques may improve this [53]. In fact, recent reports indicate that a non-viral technique that modifies a single genetic factor could produce iPSCs with nearly 100 % efficiency [73, 74].",

While stem cells are already self-renewing\u2014a characteristic that cancer cells (unfortunately) also possess\u2014progenitor cells must typically acquire this ability as part of a process that turns them cancerous. In particular, cancer stem cells have been identified as part of various types of leukemia, isolated from tumors involving the central nervous system, and found in cancers involving areas such as the breast, lung, liver, pancreas, colon, and prostate [2, 14, 76\u201378].

The physical alterations involve instantaneous plastic surgery that includes wholesale removal/reshaping of skin, bone, etc., and addition of new \u201ccells\u201d and \u201csynthetic tissue.\u201d They are vividly portrayed by sentences such as \u201cThe flesh fled from the cathode and chased after the anode as he broadened the fine nose, thickened the mobile lips, squared the slender jaw and drew out carefully the delicately arched orbital ridges.\u201d However, the process described grossly underestimates the complexity of those parts of the body, the myriad types and organization of its cells and tissues, the body\u2019s ability to heal, etc., and overall has at best a tenuous relation with actual human biology.",

How the synthetic skin would allow something as simple but essential as sweating is not addressed. Likewise, burns sufficient to \u201crequire\u201d replacing a person\u2019s entire skin would also presumably involve at least some fourth-degree burns to underlying tissues, including the most vulnerable ones such as those of the penis and scrotum. Likewise the eyelids would offer little protection to the eyes in that situation, but there is no description of the latter being \u201cboiled.\u201d",
