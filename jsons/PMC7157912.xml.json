Within the DExD/H-box family, helicases are further distinguished based on the amino acid sequence of the eponymous conserved helicase motif II (DEAD, DEAH, DExH and DExD helicases). DExD/H-box helicases share (at least) eight conserved motifs that are involved in ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, nucleic acid binding, and RNA unwinding activity. These conserved motifs are contained within a conserved structural fold that comprises two RecA-like globular domains connected by a flexible linker region [1], [2]. This structural fold facilitates the motor protein function associated with helicase activity. In general, SF2 helicases display an \u2018open conformation\u2019 when they are not bound to a nucleic acid substrate, where the two domains can quite flexibly rotate around the linker. The ATP binding site is located in the cleft between the two domains and the nucleic acid binding sites stretch across both domains. When ATP and a nucleic acid substrate are bound, the cleft between the two domains closes. This \u2018closed conformation\u2019 allows for productive ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis is likely associated with the release of the nucleic acid substrate [1], [2], [3], [4].",

            "text": "In recent years it has emerged that several DExD/H-box helicases contribute to anti-viral immunity, either by acting as sensors for viral nucleic acids or by facilitating downstream signalling events. In general, pathogens are detected by innate immune cells with the help of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognise conserved structures present in certain pathogen classes, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [6]. Viral PAMPs are mainly nucleic acids, including viral genomic RNA and DNA, as well as replication intermediates [7]. Double-stranded (ds)RNA, in particular, has long been recognised as a viral PAMP and is detected by several cellular dsRNA-binding proteins [8]. The main groups of PRRs sensing viral nucleic acids are endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the RIG-like helicases (RLHs) which are part of the DExH family of RNA helicases, and cytoplasmic DNA receptors [8]. In addition, several DExD/H-box helicases that are not part of the RIG-I family have recently been implicated in the sensing of viral nucleic acids and/or downstream signalling pathways [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. A general characteristic of anti-viral PRR signalling is the induction of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), cytokines with potent anti-viral activity. Their anti-viral activity is largely mediated by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode proteins with direct anti-viral effector functions [15]. Activation of the transcription factors IRF3 or IRF7 is required for induction of type I interferons [16], and signalling pathways downstream of antiviral PRRs engage kinases that phosphorylate and activate IRF3/7. TLR3, the RLHs and most DNA receptors discovered to date utilise the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 for phosphorylation of IRF3/7 [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Their upstream signalling pathways are quite divergent: TLR3 depends on the TIR-domain containing adaptor molecule TRIF [22], the RLHs utilise a CARD-domain containing mitochondrial adaptor called MAVS (also called IPS-1, Cardif or VISA) [18], [23], [24], [25], and most cytosolic DNA receptors depend on an ER-resident adaptor molecule called STING [26].",

Interestingly, while all pro- and eukaryotic genomes contain RNA helicase genes, a lot of viruses do not seem to encode their own RNA helicases. This suggests that viruses rely heavily on host RNA helicases to mediate RNA remodelling events that are part of their replication cycle or required for viral gene expression. As such, several DExD/H-box helicases have been identified as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses, including those that pose major global health threats, such as HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).",

            "text": "The RIG-like helicases (RLHs), RIG-I, mda5 and lgp2, are part of the DExH RNA helicase family, and are recognised as one of the most important groups of anti-viral PRRs [34]. In contrast to other DExD/H-box helicases that have recently been implicated in anti-viral immunity (discussed below), RIG-I and mda5 contain CARD signalling domains [35] that allow them to interact with the mitochondrial CARD-domain containing adaptor molecule MAVS [24]. In addition to the N-terminal tandem CARD domains and the central helicase core region comprising the conserved two RecA-like domains, RLHs also contain a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD or RD) which mediates specific recognition of viral RNAs [36], [37]. Intensive research over the last few years has defined the RNA ligands for RIG-I. It is now widely accepted that RIG-I binds with high affinity to blunt-ended RNAs containing a free 5\u2032 triphosphate end (5\u2032ppp), followed by a short double stranded region of at least 19 bp [38]. Studies in Influenza and Sendai virus-infected cells have confirmed these requirements and demonstrated that RIG-I stimulatory activity resides primarily in progeny viral genomes, which contain a 5\u2032ppp and adopt so-called \u2018panhandle\u2019 structures through intramolecular base-pairing [39], [40]. Baum et al. identified SeV defective interfering (DI) copy-back genomes as particularly strong RIG-I ligands in SeV infected cells. These DI genomes consist of a 546-nt RNA molecule with a 5\u2032ppp and a 92nt long perfect dsRNA portion [39]. Recent structural studies have also provided a lot of insights into ligand binding and activation of the RLHs. Specificity of 5\u2032ppp binding is mostly conferred by the CTD, while the helicase core region binds to the double-stranded part of the RNA ligand. This binding does not confer sequence specificity, as contacts are made exclusively with the phosphoribose backbone of the RNA [41]. Initial binding of the 5\u2032ppp end to the CTD appears to allow for subsequent cooperative binding of the double-stranded region of the RNA and ATP to the helicase core domain [42].",

It is possible that a high concentration of dsRNA can overcome the initial requirement for 5\u2032ppp binding to the CTD, as this is believed to facilitate binding of the RNA ligand to the helicase core region by increasing the local concentration of dsRNA. In addition, RIG-I can also be activated by RNase L cleavage products of viral and cellular RNAs, which do not contain a 5\u2032ppp end [48].

However, RNAs containing a 3\u2032overhang were not good IFN-inducers in cells [49], and it is now believed that RIG-I does not efficiently bind to RNAs with single-stranded overhangs [50], suggesting that these are not physiological ligands for RIG-I. It has also been suggested that while RIG-I can translocate on RNA [51], it might lack a phenylalanine loop motif required for RNA unwinding [52].

These higher order complexes of RIG-I and ubiquitin were shown to be strong inducers of type I IFN [53]. The RIG-I CARD domains can also be directly ubiquitinated by Trim25 [54], which should sterically prevent them from interacting with the helicase domain to re-instate the autoinhibited state [42]. Recently, it has been shown that the 14-3-3\u03b5 chaperone protein is involved in facilitating a stable TRIM25-RIG-I interaction and shuttling of the RIG-I complex to the mitochondrial membrane where it can interact with MAVS [55]. It has become clear in recent years that organelle membrane reorganisation events are closely linked with the induction of innate immune signalling pathways. Mitochondrial fusion events [56], [57], as well as interactions between mitochondria, mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and peroxisomes [58] seem to be necessary to achieve signalling through MAVS. Also, a recent study showed that the signalling molecule TRAF3 normally resides in ER-associated compartments and the cis-Golgi, while smaller TRAF3-containing speckles appeared following virus infection [59]. Translocation of TRAF3 to mitochondria was mediated by Sec16a and p115, proteins that function in ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport. Knockdown of these proteins inhibited dsRNA-induced IFN induction, showing that this translocation of TRAF3 is crucial for assembly of MAVS-signalling complexes [59]. TRAF3 is required for IRF3/7 activation downstream of anti-viral PRRs and consequently for the induction of type I interferons [60].",

However, while they also mediate binding to blunt-ended dsRNA molecules, the CTDs of mda5 and lgp2 have no specificity for 5\u2032ppp ends [67], [68]. The lgp2 CTD, but not the mda5 CTD, also appears to mediate the same autoinhibited state that has been described for RIG-I [69]. From the structure of the mda5 CTD it is initially unclear why mda5 is preferentially activated by long dsRNA [67]. In this context, it is interesting to note that the CTD of mda5 has a much lower affinity for dsRNA molecules than the CTDs of RIG-I and lgp2 [67]. Thus, it is interesting that mda5 appears to cooperatively assemble on dsRNA filaments, similar to what had been described for RIG-I activation by longer dsRNAs without a 5\u2032ppp. This cooperative assembly of mda5 might overcome the initial low affinity of its CTD for dsRNA, although it has been questioned whether the CTD is required for RNA binding at all [70]. The CTD appears to be required for cooperative assembly of mda5 filaments on dsRNA, possibly through mediating an intermolecular interaction with another mda5 molecule [70], [71]. In any case, the ensuing mda5-coated RNA filaments appear to be well suited to induce oligomerisation of MAVS via CARD-CARD interactions [70], [71], [72].",

Due to its lack of signalling domains, it was initially believed to be an inhibitory RLH and overexpression of lgp2 indeed suppressed RIG-I signalling [73]. Studies on lgp2 knockout mice however offered a more differentiated view of the role of lgp2 [74], [75], [76], [77]. They provide evidence that lgp2 enhances mda5-dependent IFN induction in response to picornavirus infection. As the affinity of the mda5 CTD for dsRNA is relatively low, lgp2 might serve as a co-receptor that facilitates RNA binding to mda5, e.g. by increasing the local concentration of suitable RNA ligands [74], [75]. It has recently been shown that the basal ATP hydrolysis activity displayed by lgp2, which distinguishes it from mda5 and RIG-I, is required for enhanced binding of lgp2 to dsRNA, in particular to imperfect dsRNA substrates containing noncomplementary bulges [78]. The authors showed that this basal ATP hydrolysis activity of lgp2 was required for its enhancement of mda5-mediated IFN induction, suggesting that lgp2 might bind to dsRNA first before sensitizing mda5 to these RNA ligands [78]. The extent of lgp2 involvement in mda5 signalling might depend on the nature of the dsRNA ligand, e.g. its overall length and the presence of secondary structures, such as bulges and hairpins.",

As mentioned above, lgp2 was initially described to inhibit RIG-I signalling through an interaction between its CTD and the helicase domain of RIG-I [69], [73]. In keeping with this, Lgp2 knockout mice were shown to display enhanced IFN production to VSV infection [74], and endogenous lgp2 limited the responses to seasonal influenza virus strains that activate IRF3 and induce IFN [77]. However, another study suggested that loss of lgp2 leads to defects in RIG-I-mediated VSV and Sendai virus recognition [75]. Lgp2 also appears to be required for responses to cytoplasmic poly(dA:dT) DNA, Listeria monocytogenes and vaccinia virus, which are likely mediated by RIG-I ligands generated through RNA polymerase III activity [76]. This controversial data on the relationship between RIG-I and lgp2 might suggest that lgp2 can act as both an inhibitor and activator of RIG-I, possibly depending on the nature of the RNA ligand and the cellular concentration of lgp2. It will require further investigations to understand whether and how lgp2 positively and negatively modulates RIG-I-dependent responses to different dsRNA ligands, and also how exactly it enhances mda5 recognition of dsRNA.",

DDX3X is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, while expression of the DDX3Y protein appears to be restricted to the male germline [80]. Like many DEAD-box helicases, DDX3(X) has been implicated in various different aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcriptional regulation, splicing, mRNA export, ribosome biogenesis and translational regulation [81]. It has been suggested to regulate transcription of the E-Cadherin, p21/waf and ifnb promoters [82], [83], [84], and recent studies appear to manifest a role for DDX3 in translational regulation, in particular for mRNAs with complex 5\u2032UTRs [85], [86].",

The study we were involved in identified DDX3 as a molecular host target of the vaccinia virus protein K7. K7 inhibited ifnb induction at the level of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, the two key kinases that phosphorylate IRF3/7 downstream of TLR3, TLR4, the RLHs, and most known cytoplasmic DNA receptors. We showed that DDX3 interacted with IKK\u03b5 after Sendai virus stimulation and that it enhanced induction of the ifnb promoter [87]. The intrinsically unstructured N-terminal region of DDX3 was required for this activity, but its ATPase and RNA unwinding activities were not [87]. The second report concurrently revealed that DDX interacts with, and is a phosphorylation target of, TBK1. TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of DDX3 was shown to be required for the effect of DDX3 on the ifnb promoter [84]. This study therefore also supported a role for DDX3 in ifnb promoter induction downstream of TBK1/IKK\u03b5. However, the authors also demonstrated that DDX3 was recruited to the ifnb promoter enhancer region, suggesting that DDX3 acts as a transcriptional regulator after being activated by TBK1 [84].",

Oshiumi et al. demonstrated an interaction between DDX3 and MAVS and suggested that DDX3 acts as a sensor for viral RNA in conjunction with RIG-I and mda5. The authors proposed that DDX3 can sensitize the RLH system for dsRNA ligands at early stages of infection when levels of the IFN-inducible RIG-I are still low [13]. The same group later demonstrated that the HCV Core protein, which had previously been shown to interact with DDX3, can disrupt the MAVS-DDX3 interaction and thus act as a viral immune evasion protein preventing IFN induction [88]. Contrary to this, another report suggested that HCV Core protein actually triggers IFN induction through DDX3 [89]. Culture-adapted strains of HCV had acquired mutations in the N-terminal DDX3-binding region of the Core protein, which lowered their binding affinity for DDX3. This resulted in reduced TBK1-dependent IFN induction and enhanced replication of the culture adapted strains [89]. As DDX3 is required for HCV replication [90], [91], the DDX3-HCV Core protein interaction will also be discussed in this context in Section 3.1.",

In fact, in the study by Yong-Jun Liu's group, DDX41 and IFI16 were both required for the response to cytosolic DNA and DNA viruses in the human monocytic THP1 cell line [10]. The authors suggested that the constitutively expressed DDX41 acts as an early sensor of viral DNA, while IFI16 is upregulated at later stages of viral infections in a DDX41-dependent manner. Indeed, IFI16 expression was nearly completely absent in cells lacking DDX41 [10].",

These bacterial second messenger molecules act as PAMPs that signal the presence of an intracellular bacterial infection and induce a type I IFN response. DDX41 has been shown to induce a STING-TBK1-IRF3-dependent type I IFN response, following its binding to CDNs [101]. However, STING itself can also directly bind CDNs, and it was previously proposed that STING can directly sense the presence of CDNs without the need for an upstream receptor [102]. More recently, two studies from the Chen lab described cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) as a novel second messenger that is generated in response to cytoplasmic DNA in mammalian cells [103], [104]. They identified a nucleotidyltransferase, cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which generates cGAMP in response to cytosolic DNA [104]. They implicated cGAS as a universal DNA sensor that triggers the activation of downstream molecules, such as STING, in a cGAMP-dependent manner [104]. The respective roles of DDX41 and STING in CDN sensing remain to be clarified, and also whether direct binding of cytosolic DNA to these two proteins is required.",

The function of SNX2 is also largely unclear, but it is part of the retromer complex that shuttles receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network [106]. It is possible that SNX2 is also involved in other intracellular trafficking events [107]. As mentioned above, it is becoming increasingly clear that innate immune responses are intricately linked with membrane reorganisation and vesicle transport events [59], [108]. Reminiscent of what was observed for TRAF3, STING appears to traffic from the ER to the Golgi in response to cytoplasmic DNA sensing. It eventually assembles with TBK1 in cytoplasmic punctuate structures [108]. Therefore, it is an intriguing idea that DDX41 might be involved in STING trafficking through its interaction with a sorting nexin; a potential role of DDX41 that might warrant further investigation.",

In myeloid DCs, type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to poly(I:C) was attenuated after knockdown of DHX9. Binding of DHX9 to poly(I:C) required its two N-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domains rather than the helicase core region. The C-terminus of DHX9 was shown to interact with the CARD domain of the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS, suggesting that DHX9 links into the RLH signalling pathway. In fact, either RIG-I or mda5 were also required for the response to poly(I:C) in addition to DHX9, depending on the exact nature of the RNA ligand used [9]. In pDCs, DHX9 was shown to be required for the induction of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 by CpG-B DNA, in a MyD88-dependent manner (see also Section 2.6) [14]. There is also additional evidence for a role of DHX9 in innate immunity. It is an interferon-inducible gene and has been shown to get phosphorylated by the dsRNA-binding kinase PKR [109], providing a link between DHX9 and responses to viral dsRNA in a different context. DHX9 phosphorylation by PKR was investigated in the context of its requirement for HIV replication and decreased its affinity for RNA [109] (see also Section 3.3).",

This observation suggests that DHX9 might have a role in regulating transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) or subsequent processing of ISG mRNAs [110]. This potential function of DHX9 also clearly implicates DHX9 in anti-viral immune responses, as the anti-viral effects of IFNs are largely executed by IFN-stimulated genes.

The authors then showed that only DDX1 directly bound to poly(I:C), a slightly unexpected finding as DHX36 and DDX21 would be expected to bind dsRNA via their conserved helicase motifs. Instead, DDX21 and DHX36 were placed downstream of DDX1. DDX21 bound to both DDX1 and DHX36, suggesting that it bridges the interaction between these two helicases [11]. DDX21 also interacted with itself, suggesting that the complex might be a DDX1-DDX21-DDX21-DHX36 complex. Both DDX21 and DHX36 interacted with TRIF, the TIR-adaptor molecule that mediates signalling downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 [11]. This suggested that DDX1 senses dsRNA and then triggers signalling via DDX21 and DHX36 to TRIF. Knockdown of DDX1, DDX21 or DHX36 inhibited IFN induction in response to long or short poly(I:C), Influenza Virus and Reovirus [11].

It can be recruited into stress granules via its N-terminal RNA-binding domain [117]. It has also been shown to be involved in the degradation of ARE-containing RNAs [118]. Furthermore, DHX36 has been described to recognise and remove so-called quadruplex knots in G-rich RNA and DNA (G4-loops) [119], [120]. Its specificity for G4-loops is mediated by the N-terminal RNA-binding domain of DHX36 rather than its helicase core region [119]. G4 loops are found in telomeric repeats, but they also seem to be present in gene promoter regions where they block transcription [121]. Indeed, DHX36 has been suggested to resolve G4-loops present in the promoter of the transcriptional regulator YY1 and to thus facilitate its transcription [122]. YY1 has recently been shown to negatively regulate the ifnb promoter, providing another potential link between DHX36 and anti-viral immunity [123].",

It generally appears to be the case for DExD/H-box helicases that interactions with specific RNA ligands are mediated by adjacent additional RNA-binding domains or are facilitated through interactions with other RNA-binding proteins [2], [4].

As DexD/H-box helicases bind to RNA and in some cases also to DNA in a rather indiscriminate manner via the conserved helicase motifs, it is not unexpected to observe them interacting with various synthetic or viral nucleic acids. However, several DExD/H-box helicases, including DDX3 and DHX9, have additional functions that are independent of their RNA unwinding activity and in many cases also their ATPase activity [5], [84], [87]. Mere in vitro binding to RNA or DNA should therefore not be sufficient to characterise a DExD/H-box protein as a nucleic acid sensor.",

Several studies have already attempted to develop inhibitors for DDX3, mainly directed against its ATPase activity: Ring expanded nucleoside analogues inhibiting the ATPase activity of DDX3 suppressed HIV replication without displaying any apparent cellular toxicity [134]. Another group identified small molecule inhibitors of DDX3's ATPase activity using pharmacophore modelling, and showed that these were also able to block HIV replication [135], [136]. A recent study developed inhibitors targeting the RNA-binding interface of DDX3. These inhibitors also blocked ATPase and unwinding activity of DDX3 and suppressed HIV replication in human PBMCs [137].",

            "text": "In contrast to its role as an essential host factor in HCV replication, DDX3 inhibited the replication of another hepatotropic virus, Hepatitis B Virus. A study by Wang et al. showed that DDX3 interacts with HBV polymerase, gets incorporated into nucleocapsids and inhibits viral reverse transcription [93]. As mentioned in Section 2.2., it has since also been demonstrated that the HBV polymerase blocks the function of DDX3 in innate immune signalling pathways leading to IFN induction [93], [94]. Interestingly, in an analysis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, DDX3 levels were found to be reduced in HCC samples from HBV-positive patients, while no reduction was observed in samples from HCV-positive patients [143]. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent cancer in the modern world and is strongly linked with hepatitis virus infection [144]. The above-mentioned study linked DDX3 to the progression of cancer by showing that knockdown of DDX3 led to early entry into S-phase and an increased growth rate [143]. It was suggested that while HBV downregulates DDX3 expression (possibly to escape its inhibitory effect on viral reverse transcription), HCV might disable DDX3 function through the Core protein interaction [143]. Future research should clarify the mechanism by which DDX3 contributes to HCV replication and elucidate the functional consequences of the Core protein-DDX3 interaction on viral replication and HCV-mediated pathological effects, such as the development of liver cirrhosis and HCC.",

It was shown to bind to the double-stranded stem of the HIV TAR leader RNA and to enhance transcription from the HIV-LTR [157]. Phosphorylation by PKR within the N-terminal RNA binding domain reduced the affinity of DHX9 for RNA and binding to the HIV TAR [109]. In a separate study, DHX9 increased the levels of unspliced HIV CTE- and RRE-containing mRNAs and was therefore proposed to release incompletely spliced HIV RNAs from spliceosomes for export out of the nucleus [158]. DHX9 has also been suggested to facilitate export of RRE- and CTE-containing viral RNAs through an alternative nuclear export pathway mediated by the Sam68 cofactor and TAP [159]. There is increasing evidence that DHX9 facilitates translation of HIV RNAs through binding to the 5\u2032UTR [160]. DHX9 has also been shown to be incorporated into HIV virions by interacting with the HIV gag protein and HIV RNA. When DHX9 was knocked down in virus producer cells, the resulting virions were less infective and had a defect at the level of reverse transcription [161]. Another recent study showed that DHX9 facilitates the annealing of tRNA3\nLys to HIV gag mRNA. The viral RNA with its associated tRNA3\nLys is then incorporated into assembling virions [162]. As DHX9 has also been shown to facilitate translation of gag mRNA [160], it appears that DHX9 can regulate two subsequent steps in the viral life cycle. The authors suggested that DHX9 together with the HIV gag protein remodels the viral RNA which switches it from being translated to being incorporated into the newly assembling virions [162]. Thus, as stated above, DHX9 appears to be involved in virtually all steps regulating the expression of HIV genes as well as the assembly of new virions. This is not inconceivable, as other viral and cellular proteins that regulate transcription or export of HIV RNAs, such as HIV Tat, HIV Rev, DDX3 and Sam68, have also been shown to regulate translation of viral RNAs [86], [163], [164].",

Interestingly, the study that implicated DHX9 as a sensor for dsRNA in myeloid DCs showed that influenza virus-induced IFN-\u03b1 production was reduced in cells after DHX9 knockdown (see section 2.4) [9]. This points to a potentially very interesting dual function for DHX9, in that it might be mediating IFN-induction in response to a virus that actively recruits it to facilitate viral replication. On the other hand, the reduced IFN-\u03b1 production observed by Zhang et al. might also be a result of decreased viral replication in the absence of DHX9, however viral replication was not assessed in this study [9].",

Due to intensive research over the years and recent structural studies, we now have a good understanding of how the RIG-like helicases selectively bind viral RNA ligands and trigger signalling pathways in response. For other DExD/H-box helicases that have recently been implicated in anti-viral immunity, these fundamental questions remain to be addressed. In particular, it needs to be clarified whether \u2018sensing\u2019 nucleic acids is their main role and if so, how exactly they distinguish between cellular and viral nucleic acids. It will also be interesting to investigate how they co-operate or intersect with other nucleic acid sensing pathways.

In several cases, it has been shown that the subcellular localisation of these helicases changed when they interacted with viral RNA, namely from a primarily nuclear localisation to cytoplasmic viral replication sites. It might be this redistribution that allowed them to come in contact with the adaptors mediating innate immune pathways. Or have viruses evolved to primarily co-opt helicases that are involved in anti-viral immunity, a strategy that would give them the dual benefit of acquiring RNA unwinding activity while simultaneously disrupting anti-viral immune responses?",

DDX3 has been suggested to act as a sensor of viral dsRNA in conjunction with the RLHs, as a signalling intermediate downstream of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 and as a transcriptional regulator of the ifnb promoter. DDX60 has also been proposed to sensitize the RLH to viral dsRNA ligands. DDX41 seems to sense cytoplasmic DNA and signal in a STING-dependent manner. DHX9 has been proposed to sense dsRNA and to signal in a MAVS-dependent manner, and separately it was implicated in the response to CpG-B DNA where it signals through MyD88. A complex of DDX1, DDX21 and DHX36 has been suggested to detect dsRNA and to signal via TRIF.
