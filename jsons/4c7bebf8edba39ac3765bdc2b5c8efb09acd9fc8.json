One of the earliest and most plausible explanations of potentiating action is the inhibition of bradykinin destroying enzymes like ACE, NEP and other proteases under certain physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Teprotide is considered to exert its hypotensive effect by inhibition of the renin angiotensin system [56] . Since BK degradation is linked to the activity and composition of proteo-lytic enzymes used in the test systems, different activities of the factors can result. Influence on membrane potential, and increased Ca 2+ influx from extracellular sources are also possible reactions. Receptor-mediated actions include the intracellular mobilization of Ca 2+ , increased formation of IP n , NO, arachidonic acid and prostaglandins. Further hypothetical possibilities are the non BK receptor-mediated stimulation of the pathways by a direct interaction with G-proteins and crosstalk with pathways of other receptors. Also the receptor molecule itself can be phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at the cytosolic loops, or the receptor can homo-or hetero-oligomerize.
