The positive\u2010stranded RNA genome of HAV serves as a template for both translation and replication. The translated polyprotein is autocleaved by the viral 3C protease into structural and nonstructural proteins (Fig. 1A), including the viral polymerase which is crucial for initiating replication. 3C protease, which preferentially cleaves after glutamine 8 (Fig. 1B), also cleaves several cellular proteins (Fig. 1C), to arrest translation and promote viral replication 9, 10, or to subvert host innate immune pathways 11. Other members of the Picornaviridae family utilize a similar 3C\u2010mediated proteolytic mechanism for generating viral proteins and cleaving cellular components, to establish infection. Similarly, SARS\u2010CoV of the Coronaviridae family employs a 3C\u2010like protease for autoprocessing of viral proteins 12, 13.

The catalytic site of 3C protease is a triad formed by Cys172, His44, and Asp84 27 (Fig. 1D). A binding pocket encompassing the catalytic site and oxyanion hole, along with the nearby residues involved in substrate binding, was identified as a potential active site by the active site prediction program, AADS 28. About one million organic molecules from the ZINC database 29 were screened against this binding pocket of HAV 3C protease using a rapid screening protocol (RASPD 30), in order to select 1000 best hits. These compounds were then subjected to atomic level docking and scoring using ParDOCK 31, 32. A number of 250 molecules with the highest predicted binding energies were subjected to short molecular dynamics simulations. Eventually, seven compounds (1\u20137; Table 1) which showed potential to form strong interactions with the protease, were further subjected to 100 ns simulations, in order to understand the dynamics of their binding to the enzyme.",

Indoles, in the recent past, have turned out to be effective scaffolds not only in biology and medicine but also in material sciences 33, 34. An indole backbone, with various substituents on the core structure, has the ability to display a spectrum of functionalities. In particular, and due to their broad structural diversity, isatins have been shown to affect a wide range of biological targets 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. We computationally screened a variety of isatin derivatives against HAV 3C protease, and found that two modifications in the protecting groups of isatins (in compounds 8 and 9; Table 1) resulted in better interactions with the target, as reflected in docking studies as well as in the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Compound 8 contains a triphenylmethyl protecting group, which restricted the conformations of the compound in the binding pocket of 3C protease, thus facilitating a snug fit. Compound 9 is a substrate mimic, with an N\u2010acetyl protecting group containing an amide bond that competitively inhibits the attack of Cys172 nucleophile on the substrate. This amide bond hinders the transfer of proton of S\u03b3 of Cys172 by N\u03b5 of His44, necessary for substrate cleavage.",

The ligand and protein backbone RMSD plots (Fig. S1) for all the proposed nine compounds remained stable during the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations, except for compound 5. This compound was found to drift to another site which comprised of similar residues as the originally targeted site. Also, the ligand RMSD for compound 9 showed fluctuations for approximately 10 ns during the initial 30 ns simulation. However, extension of the simulation upto 100 ns showed that compound 9 eventually gets stabilized in a conformation similar to its initial docked pose (Fig. S3, Fig. 2), which could potentially reflect the actual binding mechanism.

This indicated that compound 5 probably binds to an offsite other than the predicted binding pocket of HAV 3C protease. To find a plausible reason for this anomaly in expected versus actual binding, we carried out a detailed, computational binding mode analysis of compound 5, compared to other compounds. Our analysis showed that the distance between Cys172 (one of the residues in the catalytic triad) and the central atom of compound 5 increases with respect to time during the simulation (Fig. 4); although the other compounds stay near the catalytic triad with similar hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions throughout the duration of the simulations (Figs 4 and 2A). The interaction diagram in Fig. 2A shows that the HAV 3C residues eventually interacting with compound 5 are significantly different than those in the initial docked position, suggesting a possible shift in the binding site. Compound 5 appeared to form strong interactions with residues Trp161, Glu166, Gly165, Gly163, Arg16, and Asn196 present 15 \u00c5 away from the catalytic site, confirming the drift of this compound from its initial docked pose at the targeted binding site. The offsite shares six residues with the targeted site (Fig. 2), which partially explains the anomalous binding at that pose. Our MTT assays showed that compound 5 caused more than 70% cell death at 200 \u03bcm concentration. Given that compound 5 showed propensity for possible drift from catalytic and substrate\u2010binding sites, with a high inhibition constant and potential toxicity at just twice its inhibitory concentration, this compound was not used for further studies.",

The importance of 3C protease in the processing of viral proteins makes it a key component in establishment of infection. Further, the structural and functional similarities among the 3C proteases from picornaviruses make this enzyme a viable drug target for generic drug development. In the current study, we have utilized the principles of structure\u2010based drug design to identify novel compounds against the 3C protease of HAV. Several of these compounds have shown efficacy against the functionality of HAV 3C protease in the low micromolar range, along with reduced cytotoxicity. Through computational analyses, we selected nine compounds, (seven from ZINC library and two isatin derivatives), and the inhibitory activity of all compounds was validated through in vitro enzymatic assays. We found that eight out of the nine compounds bound competitively to HAV 3C and showed inhibition at the low micromolar range, with compounds 6, 8, and 9 proposed as best leads, based on effective inhibition and low cytotoxicity.

The most active keto\u2010glutamine analogs 48 demonstrated K\ni of 9 \u03bcm. Nonpeptide inhibitors of HAV 3C displayed inhibition in the nanomolar range, which was probably occasioned due to the exceptionally low K\nm values of the halopyridinyl ester substrates 49. Peptidyl monofluoromethyl ketone inhibitors against HAV 3C were ineffective due to poor oral bioavailability 50. A peptide aldehyde inhibitor 40 showed potent activity against HAV 3C; however, it was not similarly effective against other picornaviral proteases, showing 50\u2010fold less inhibition against HRV14 3C protease. On the other hand, tripeptide aldehyde inhibitors 51 showed low micromolar range inhibitory activity against only HRV14 3C. Isatin inhibitors against HRV14 3C showed strong activity but were toxic in cell culture even in nanomolar concentrations 52, while the isatin\u2010based compounds designed by us (compounds 8 and 9) have not only shown potent inhibition but have also been essentially nontoxic even at very high inhibitor concentrations (200 \u03bcm). Other isatin derivatives have been shown to inhibit SARS\u2010coronavirus 3C\u2010like protease with comparable activity 19, 53, but as far as we know, this is the first description of isatins as effective inhibitors against HAV 3C protease. We found that the MMBAPPL (a scoring protocol for calculating binding affinity for protein\u2013ligand complexes for various binding poses occurring during molecular simulations) score strongly correlates to the experimental K\ni values, as compared to the MMGBSA and MMPBSA scores, which has increased our confidence in the protocol (Fig. S2). Moreover, the stringent screening cutoff of a \u221210 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121 docking binding energy threshold likely played a key role in predicting true potential inhibitors (Fig. S6), which later showed low micromolar range inhibition via experimental enzyme binding assays. Thus, based on our computational and functional studies, we conclude that compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are able to show strong inhibitory potential at low micromolar concentrations against the 3C protease of two members of the Picornaviridae family \u2014 HAV and HRV.",

In our computational study, the ionization state of His44 was kept as HID44, so that the N\u03b5 of HID44 can interact with S\u03b3 H of Cys172 via a hydrogen bond 27, while all other histidines were kept in HIE state using AMBER14 force field 26, 55, 56, 57.

The prepared system was first subjected to minimization of solvent molecules alone, for 2500 steepest descent and 2500 conjugate gradient steps. This was followed by minimization of the whole solute\u2010solvent system for 2500 steepest descent and 2500 conjugate gradient steps. The energy minimized system was then heated gradually in NVT ensemble up to 300 K while subjecting the protein\u2013ligand complex to harmonic restraints of 25 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121. Afterward, the system was equilibrated in NPT ensemble at 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat while releasing the harmonic restraints on the complex from 5 to 0.1 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121, in six steps of 50 ps each. Finally, all restraints were released and 100 ns production run in NPT ensemble (P = 1 bar, T = 300 K) was carried out. The overall binding free energy of the protein\u2013ligand complexes throughout the trajectories was calculated using MMBAPPL 62, MMGBSA, and MMPBSA 63, 64. MMGBSA and MMPBSA are popular approaches where the molecular mechanics energies are combined with the Poisson\u2013Boltzmann or generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation to get an estimate of binding free energies of small ligands to biological macromolecules. MMBAPPL is an empirical scoring function to predict the binding free energies of protein\u2013ligand complexes. These scores, when generated for each snapshot of molecular dynamics simulations, provide a better understanding of the inhibitory potential of a compound over time, based on the predicted binding free energies. For each system simulated, the root mean squared deviation, energy (kinetic, potential, and total), density and temperature was monitored to ensure that the standard deviation of each of these values were within acceptable limits. A total of 250 short molecular dynamics simulations of 10 ns each were performed where majority of the compounds studied showed instability of protein\u2013ligand complexes which was reflected in their RMSD values. Only the complexes showing stable behavior after 10 ns simulations were subjected to further analysis. Extended simulations were run till 100 ns to understand the behavior of ligand in the docked complex. The binding energies of the complexes were calculated using MMBAPPL during those parts of molecular dynamics simulations where the complexes were found to exist for maximum time (Fig. S1). Further, 25 compounds from isatin in\u2010house library 39 were docked and scored against HAV 3C protease to check for their inhibitory potential. All isatin compounds showed low binding potential computationally; hence iterative modifications in their structure were undertaken. Eventually, 34 modified isatin compounds showed better results in terms of interactions and binding free energies with HAV 3C.",

Subsequently, increasing concentrations of the fluorogenic peptide were added and readings were taken at \u03bbex = 336 nm and \u03bbem = 472 nm. All data were collected in triplicates.",

For data fitting into the allosteric sigmoidal model, the equation used was Y = V\nmax*Sh/(K\nprime + S\nh), where h is Hill's slope and K\nprime is related to Michaelis constant. Analysis using other modes of inhibition such as noncompetitive or mixed inhibition resulted in higher regression coefficients, standard errors and wider 95% confidence intervals.
