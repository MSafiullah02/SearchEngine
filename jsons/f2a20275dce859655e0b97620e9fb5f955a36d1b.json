[3] So far, there has been no concrete data on the overall incidence of thrombosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. [3] It is, however, estimated that about 50% of these patients have elevated ddimer levels during disease progression which is directly associated with the risk of increased thrombosis and poor prognosis of the disease. [2, 5] Multivariable regression showed increased odds of in-hospital death associated with d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764-128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033). [4] A higher risk of vessel thrombosis has been correlated with the severity of the disease and multiorgan involvement, leading support to the argument of therapeutic anticoagulation of COVID-19 patients with elevated d-dimer levels. [5] The proposed mechanisms for COVID-19 induced thrombosis include a disease-specific hypercoagulable state, cytokine-mediated diffuse microvascular damage and in some cases reactive thrombocytosis. [6] The risk of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can further be compounded by obesity, advanced age, and hospitalization related immobilization. In the present case, the patient had elevated CRP and d-dimer levels with no other risk factor for pulmonary embolism, indicating COVID-19 related hypercoagulable state as possible etiology for thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature.",
