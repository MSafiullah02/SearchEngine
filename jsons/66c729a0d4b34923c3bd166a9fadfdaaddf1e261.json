We developed an interactive web application that allows users to visualize the spread of COVID-19 in the Unites States at state and county levels. This tool allows visualization of how the virus spreads over time and how state-wide efforts to reduce transmissions have affected the curve in local areas. The downloadable application data allows users to conduct additional analyses. We demonstrate exemplars of trend analyses comparing the daily infection and death rates before and after safer at home orders were implemented per state. The goal was to develop a COVID-19 tracking tool that informs users about the spread of the virus to enable them to make informed decisions after better understanding the presented data.",

This outbreak has since spread to at least 185 countries and infected over 3 million people (as of May 1, 2020). Response to the pandemic in the United States is coordinated mainly at the state government level. In order to track and visualize the spread of coronavirus disease and evaluate trends in response to state government interventions in the United States, we developed an automatically updating Shiny application. This application enables users to view trends in numbers of verified COVID-19 infections and deaths as reported by county health departments across the United States.",

Upon interaction with the map, the plots are updated automatically to show state or county specific data. Additionally, we allow for users to filter the data based on previous dates, as well as normalize the number of confirmed infections or deaths by a state or county's population (per 100K residents). We display two tables that show the top 10 counties in terms of their number of confirmed infections and deaths ( In the Trends subpanel a rolling slope plot is displayed that allows for illustration of the \"flattening of the curve\", or the slope changes of the log transformed cumulative death and infection numbers ( Figure 2J -L). A moving 7-day window was applied to extract the slope of the linear regression as a function of 1-week intervals. These windows were calculated for every 7-day period and the \"rolling slope\" values were plotted against the date. Higher slopes are indicative of a surge in the number of confirmed infections or deaths whereas a slope of 0 indicates stagnant confirmed case or death numbers.",

The interactive map of the US allows users to visualize the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 infections (Figure 1 ) with plots for summary statistics, data transformations, and trends for the US. Additionally, we implemented data visualization at the state and county level ( Figure 1B) . Upon user interaction with the map, the graphs update to reflect the data in the selected state or county (Figure 2 A-D), including annotations for statewide stay at home orders, for each state. An emphasis was placed on scientific representation of the case numbers, therefore, population doublings (PDs) were calculated on both the log and normal scale ( Figure 2C ). To highlight and track COVID-19 flattening, a rolling slope was calculated ( Figure 2D) , showing the slope of the cumulative case regression over all 1-week intervals. Reductions of the rolling slope indicate a flattening of the curve, whereas increases of the slope indicate an acceleration in reported case number. Notably for Los Angeles County a 2-week delay in rolling slope reduction is observed between infections and deaths following issuance of the California Safer at Home order.",

Assuming that COVID-19 surveillance will continue in earnest throughout the Fall and Winter of 2020, and into the Spring of 2021, we speculate that visualizations such as the rolling slope may help identify resurgence of infections within counties and states .

We use their 2018 population estimates to get a more accurate sense of current population levels and demographic breakdown.We implemented the U.S. COVID Tracker app as an independently updating app on a shinyapps.io server that pulls the latest data from the NYT data repository. Once a user opens the app, it loads a map of the U.S. with daily updating counters on the left of the map, and tables and plots at the bottom of the map(Figure 1). The interactive map allows users to zoom, pan, and click on individual locations that can change based on their map view selection. By default, state-level data are shown with a pseudo-coloring according to the total number of confirmed infections in a respective state. By selecting county view, the map updates to show all counties in the U.S. with confirmed infections.",
