Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19. Methods We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500",

The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States. Discussion These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel. Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic.

Most major national and international guidelines have yet to incorporate pharmacologic therapies for COVID-19 because high-grade evidence is lacking. 9, 10 An effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or pre-emptive therapeutic (PET) intervention would provide significant benefit to individuals, as well as to public health, given the high rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and overburdened healthcare systems.",

A recent trial of chloroquine among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil was stopped early (n = 81) because of safety concerns. Patients receiving high-dose chloroquine (12 g over ten days) had prolonged QTc ([ 500 msec) in 25% of cases, including two deaths secondary to ventricular tachycardia. 24 This dose was orders of magnitude higher than for malaria prophylaxis (500 mg weekly) or malaria treatment (2.5 g total), each of which have well-established safety profiles. 25 Hydroxychloroquine is much less toxic that chloroquine, 26 and has decades of established safety data in the treatment of malaria and other autoimmune conditions. 27 Preliminary data in COVID-19 trials have shown increased gastrointestinal upset but no significant differences in serious adverse events. 28 Early translational and clinical studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine might be an effective pharmacologic treatment to prevent viral establishment if used early after exposure or established infection. [5] [6] [7] [8] 29 Delaying treatment to the time of hospitalization, which occurs on average seven to eight days from symptom onset, 30,31 may be associated with a lack of benefit because of established viral infection. 28, 32 Nevertheless, the current evidence base is limited because of small, underpowered sample sizes and large observational studies without proper controls. 20 Global political forces continue to emphasize a not-yetproven role for hydroxychloroquine in the paradigm of COVID-19 treatment. Urgent clinical trials are therefore needed to establish whether hydroxychloroquine may be an effective therapy for COVID-19.",

Using 1:1 randomization, we calculated a required sample size of n = 621 per arm.

Therefore, we aimed to recruit a total of 1,500 patients for the PEP trial. For symptomatic patients, the proportion of patients who progress to require hospitalization is approximately 10%. 14 For this trial, we assumed that without treatment, 90% of the control arm would not be hospitalized, 8% would be hospitalized without an ICU stay or death, and 2% would be hospitalized with an ICU stay or death. With 1:1 randomization and 1,464 total participants, the PET trial has 90% power to detect a log odds ratio of 0.70.

The novel web-based design of this trial, in the setting of a highly contagious global pandemic, has ensured that all interactions with participants, including enrolment and informed consent, are done remotely using courier services to deliver medicine and using internetbased follow-up. This will allow compliance with strict social distancing strategies and reduce risks of infectious spread to study personnel and others. The design encourages large scale enrolment to ensure the target number of participants are enrolled and trial results are obtained as quickly as possible. Importantly, the design was finalized, regulatory and REB approvals were obtained, and large geographic jurisdictions brought online in an unprecedently short duration (within a few weeks of a global pandemic) with a goal to obtain the maximal information in the minimal amount of time.",
