The aim of the meeting was the implementation of European efforts towards novel vaccination strategies within a global vision, with many objectives:1.To gather the co-ordinators of the most relevant EU-funded projects on vaccine strategies, mucosal immunisation, and innate immunity, in order to establish the state of the art of the European research in this field.2.To be updated on the newest trends and directions of research on the mechanisms of innate immunity and their exploitation in the design of new vaccination strategies, with a series of high-level overviews and lectures from top scientists and opinion leaders.3.To encourage involvement of younger investigators in the field of research and development of vaccines, through data presentation, discussion with the world leaders in the field, and direct contact with an industrial research environment.4.To confront and compare international policies in the vaccine field, with presentations and discussion among representatives of NIAID (the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), EU Commission, and international organisations (WHO, IVI), to dissect the future trends of mucosal immunisation strategies within the global health policies.\n  \nProgramme of the conference\n  OPENING SESSION",

In this context, the concept set forth in 1983 by the World Bank that absence of health is the main obstacle to economic development in poor countries has placed vaccination as the first action for the economic improvement of less-developed countries [3]. Likewise, the World Health Organisation (WHO) together with UNICEF (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund) launched in 1981 a global campaign of immunisation (Expanded Programme of Immunisation, EPI) to vaccinate 80% of children world-wide with five basic vaccines (against polio, diphtheria, measles, pertussis, tetanus). The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) was founded in January 2000, to unify public and private efforts towards enlarging vaccine availability particularly in less-developed countries. The financial body of GAVI, the Vaccine Fund, has received excellent support through private donations (up to US$ 1.1 billion), including a contribution of US$ 750 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Furthermore, during the World Economic Forum held in Davos in January 2003, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has announced a further contribution of US$ 200 million to establish the \u201cGrand Challenges in Global Health\u201d initiative, to support and accelerate research and vaccine development for AIDS, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and other infections affecting the most impoverished countries.",

            "text": "The main problem faced in the practical implementation of all these enthusiastic public and private initiatives is the progressive disinterest of vaccine industries, with the consequent risk of inadequate vaccine supplies. In fact, the economic value of vaccines is negligible from the industrial viewpoint, where its potential business amounts to only about 2% of the global pharmaceutical market [4]. Other problems that make the vaccine business unattractive for companies include the high risk of liability actions, the pressing requests from humanitarian organisations for decreasing vaccine prices, the recalcitrant attitude of some public health administrations to meet the vaccine costs to the full coverage of the population. As a consequence, the number of industries producing and manufacturing vaccines has dramatically dropped in recent years. In the USA, vaccine companies have decreased from 37 in 1967 to 10, bringing about a significant shortage in vaccine supply that would expose the population to the risks of uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases [2], [5], [6]. Even more dramatic would be the situation in less-developed countries, where vaccine coverage is most needed.",

However, decreasing vaccine price for these countries does not offer a reasonable solution, as price could always be too high for them, and companies are increasingly discouraged in maintaining the vaccine business. Moreover, vaccines developed and tested in developed countries might need to be adapted to the widely different geographical conditions and infrastructure present in other countries. To make some simple examples, vaccines that need to be conserved at +4 \u00b0C may pose insurmountable difficulties of distribution in sub-equatorial countries, vaccines that need multiple administrations will face problems of compliance, injectable vaccines will pose the problem of supply of sterile syringes and or their safe disposal to avoid spreading of infections, oral or nasal vaccines will face problems of proper absorption in populations stricken by diarrhoeal and lung diseases with generalised mucosal inflammation and abundant mucus secretion.",

Again, the main problem is not that of devising an effective new vaccine, but that of adequate vaccine manufacturing and of proper vaccine distribution and administration. From this point of view, there is a tendency by international organisations of supporting the independent development of vaccine production and distribution in each country. This is an issue that further bothers vaccine companies, as they fear unforeseen competition risks with little possibility of enforcing their patent rights without raising strong public reaction and risking a generalised damage to their business. However, this does not appear as a consistent or imminent risk for companies. Indeed, implementation of independent vaccine production in less-developed countries will need a more basic and long-term strategy in supporting the social and economic development of the country.",

Thus, the first defensive activities take place at the mucosal surfaces, to avoid adhesion of micro-organisms to the cell surface (cilial movement, mucus secretion). The epithelial cells also express defence receptors (e.g. the Toll-like receptors, TLR) that recognise and bind specific pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and initiate defensive cell activation. Epithelial cells can synthesise and secrete a wide array of anti-microbial peptides (including defensins, cathelicidins and histatins) that contribute to the host defence. Cell activation leads to the production of chemokines, cytokines and other agents signalling cell injury [12]. Chemokines have the role of attracting immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells and lymphocytes) to the infection site. There, phagocytic cells (neutrophils, macrophages) can ingest and kill the micro-organisms into phagolysosomes. Other cytokines produced at the infection site, together with TLR triggering by microbial or endogenous agents, can activate immune cells to better effect their inflammatory defence action and to initiate the triggering of specific acquired immunity [13], [14], [15]. Factors with a potent anti-microbial role produced during the inflammatory reaction include cytokines and chemokines, acute phase proteins and long pentraxins, complement components [16], [17]. Dendritic cells and NK cells are also involved in pathogen recognition, antigen uptake and presentation, and cytocidal activities, contributing both to the innate defence response and to the initiation of the subsequent acquired type of specific immunity and establishment of immunological memory [18], [19], [20].",

The tropism of these bacteria for the human gut or respiratory mucosa is essential for adequate delivery to the mucosal sites. The system using Bacillus spores expressing recombinant foreign antigens is proving very effective and safe in inducing mucosal immunity and protection in experimental models [27].

Both toxins are pentamers of cell-binding B subunits, associated with a single toxic A subunit. CT and LT can potently enhance immunogenicity at the mucosal level, by increasing antigen uptake and presentation, and inducing B cell maturation and immunostimulatory cytokine production [21]. Moreover, CT and LT fail to induce tolerance and can even abrogate tolerance induction. However, their toxicity has prevented the possibility of human use [29]. Development of non-toxic CT and LT derivatives was at first based on isolated B subunits (CTB and LTB), which however worked only when physically coupled to the antigen and delivered intranasally. Non-toxic recombinant mutated forms of CT and LT retain partial adjuvant capacity as compared to the native toxins. Mutants and modifications of the A subunit of CT (CTA) are also being tested with some promising results, although in general adjuvanticity decreases with toxicity [30].",

These agents are essentially microbial products able to induce strong inflammation (e.g. bacterial LPS). However, of particular interest as potential adjuvants are synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing non-methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs, which are particularly abundant in bacterial DNA. CpG motifs bind to TLR9 and trigger strong, predominantly Th1 immune response and cytokine production [32]. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, besides good systemic adjuvants, are quite effective also as mucosal adjuvants in several experimental systems. Intranasal, oral, or vaginal administration of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides together with the antigen can induce mucosal IgA production, systemic Th1 response, cytokine production, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction, and effective protection from subsequent infectious challenge [21].",
