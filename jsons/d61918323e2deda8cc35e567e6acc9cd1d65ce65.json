The median age was 38.0 years (IQR, 32.0 to 57.0), and 46 (41.4%) patients were males. 33.3% of patients had at least one comorbidity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, and chronic liver disease). The most common symptoms on admission were fever (71.2%), cough (37.8%), fatigue (18.0%), and dyspnea (16.2%). Symptoms including diarrhea (9.0%), pharyngalgia (6.3%), myalgia (6.3%), and headache (3.6%) were rare. The median duration from illness onset to admission was 7 days (IQR, 5.0 to 10.0). Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged, and 18 patients were deteriorated, although there was no significant difference in scale of clinical status on admission between these two groups. Of the 18 deteriorated patients, 15 patients had died and 3 patients remained hospitalized in ICU up to Feb 26th, 2020.Compared with the discharged patients, the deteriorated patients were significantly older(median age, 36.0 years [IQR, 31.0-47.5]) vs 60.0 years [IQR, 48.5-81.5], have more underlying comorbidities (22 [23.7%] vs 15 [83.3%]), and were more likely to report dyspnea (9 [9.7%] vs 9 [50.0%]). Days from illness onset to admission were not different between discharged and deteriorated patients. Increased proportions of elevated body temperature, respiratory frequency, and systolic pressure were higher in the deteriorated group compared with the discharged group. Table 2 shows the laboratory findings on admission. White blood cell counts (6.51 G/L [4.03-10.10] vs 3.97 G/L [3.14-5.72]) and neutrophil counts (5.68 G/L [3.10-9.37] vs 2.34 G/L [1.82-3.51]) were higher, whereas lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) were lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The proportions of liver dysfunction (12 [66.67%] vs 21 [22.58%]) were increased in the deteriorated patients compared with the discharged patients.
