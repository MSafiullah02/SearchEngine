            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) affecting upper respiratory tract were first identified in humans in mid-1960 (Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965). In late 2002, there was emergence of a life threatening CoV of atypical pneumonia, named severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, and is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with \u223c30,000 nucleotides (Rota et al., 2003). Its genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a (\u223c490 kDa) and pp1ab (\u223c790 kDa) which are processed by 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) to generate non-structural proteins essential for viral replication (Thiel et al., 2001, Thiel et al., 2003). Due to its vital role in replication, 3CLpro has been regarded as a validated drug target. Many inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro were discovered by high throughput screening and structure-based rational design as summarized in the review articles (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013, Kumar et al., 2013, Kuo and Liang, 2015, Pillaiyar et al., 2016, Ramajayam et al., 2011, Tong, 2009, Zhao et al., 2013). After SARS-CoV infection subsided, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), has emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread worldwide, killing 36% of the reported 1826 patients (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/mers-cov/en/). Due to the similar maturation pathway, MERS-CoV 3CLpro is also regarded as a target for developing antiviral drugs (Tomar et al., 2015). Though tremendous efforts have been made to develop inhibitors, therapeutic interventions for such continuous CoV outbreaks are yet to reach market (Barnard and Kumaki, 2011, Kilianski and Baker, 2014).",

            "text": "These CoVs' 3CLpro are functionally similar to the 3Cpro in picornaviruses and both adopt chymotrypsin fold (Anand et al., 2003). However, 3CLpro is a dimer with Cys-His dyad, whereas 3Cpro is a monomer with Cys-His-Glu triad (Hsu et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2003). Picornaviruses are small, non-enveloped RNA virus with genome size of 7500\u20138000 nucleotides. Based on their genetic organization, the family is composed of 31 genera including Enterovirus (enterovirus and rhinovirus), Aphthovirus (foot-and-mouth disease virus), Cardiovirus (encephalomyocarditis virus), Hepatovirus (hepatitis A virus) and others (http://www.picornaviridae.com/). As 3Cpro is produced in all genera of Picornaviridae virus family, its inhibitors showed broad-spectrum, potent antiviral activity against rhinovirus, coxsackievirus and enterovirus (Jetsadawisut et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2015, St John et al., 2015). Though 3Cpro and 3CLpro share similar structures at their active sites, subtle differences often discriminate inhibitors. AG7088, an established 3Cpro inhibitor, was inactive against SARS-CoV 3CLpro prior to the modifications (Ghosh et al., 2005, Shie et al., 2005, Thanigaimalai et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2006). Unlike AG7088 which contains \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ester for forming covalent bond with the active-site Cys, our previously reported potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of 3Cpro from enterovirus 71 (EV71) contains aldehyde as electrophilic warhead (Kuo et al., 2008). In this work, we screened those EV71 3Cpro inhibitors against MERS-CoV 3CLpro and further evaluated the hits by cell-based assays using live MERS-CoV. Our best compounds 6b, 6c and 6d inhibited MERS-CoV 3CLpro with IC50 values ranging from 1.7 to 4.7 \u03bcM and also suppressed viral replication with EC50 values between 0.6 and 1.4 \u03bcM. These derivatives represent some of few cell-based assay-confirmed anti-MERS-CoV agents and also showed broad-spectrum activity against both \u03b1- and \u03b2-types of CoVs as described herein.",

Though it is usual to see EC50 higher than IC50, due to the presence of membrane barrier, we observed EC50 to be smaller than IC50. This could be due to the higher concentration (300 nM) used for in-vitro enzymatic assay because it is a weakly associated dimer (Tomar et al., 2015). In fact, they inhibited 50 nM SARS 3CLpro, a tight dimer, in the submicromolar range (Table 1). These compounds had CC50 larger than 100 \u03bcM for 6b and 6c or 58.6 \u03bcM for 6d against uninfected cells, resulting in selectivity index (S.I.) values larger than 71.4. As expected, compound 6a which was inactive in the enzyme assay did not suppress viral replication. GEM, used as a positive control according to a previous report (Dyall et al., 2014), was less potent in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection with an EC50 value of 8.3 \u03bcM. It also showed marginal toxicity and thus decreased viability of mock cells by 20% or more at the concentrations above 3.7 \u03bcM (Table 1 and Fig. 1).",

The initial pose of the complex was generated based on the X-ray structure (PDB code: 4RSP) of the 3CLpro in complex with a covalent inhibitor (Tomar et al., 2015) and those of the human rhinovirus 3Cpro bound with irreversible inhibitors (Matthews et al., 1999, Webber et al., 1998). Then, the simulation was done by Discovery Studio (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). A Cys at subsite S1 of 3CLpro acts as a nucleophile to cleave substrates by attacking carbonyl carbon of the amide bond between the conserved Gln at P1 and the small amino acids such as Ser, Ala or Gly at P1' (Fan et al., 2004, Needle et al., 2015). Our modelling shows that the \u03b3-sulfur of Cys148 forms a covalent bond with the 6d aldehyde carbon and the resulting oxyanion is stabilized by His41 (Fig. 4\n). A cyclic lactam moiety with cis-amide geometry on binding to 3Cpro was proposed to mimic the P1 Gln of peptide substrates (Matthews et al., 1999). Based on our docking results, the P1 lactam moiety of 6d binds to S1 subsite of 3CLpro by forming H-bonds with His166 and Glu169. The P2 phenylalanine moiety prefers to occupy S2 subsite. The cinnamoyl group of 6d occupies S3 and may be extended to S4. The amide group between phenylalanine and cinnamoyl group further forms H-bonds with Gln192 and Glu169. We also docked 6d based on the apo-form MERS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB code: 5c3n) (Ho et al., 2015). Since the free-form and ligand-bound structures showed no significant difference in the active site, the binding modes of 6d in these two structures are indeed very similar (data not shown).",

Substituent p-chloro in 6d makes halogen bonding with His194, leading to better potency. Compound 6b and 6c with slightly bulkier m-bromo and p-dimethylamino moiety, respectively, displayed approximately 2-fold drop in IC50. Compound 6a with the bulkiest 3,4-methylenedioxy substituent failed to inhibit the 3CLpro even at 25 \u03bcM. Compounds 4a and 5a that lacked aldehyde warhead failed to inhibit 3CLpro, emphasizing the importance of reactive aldehyde electrophile.",

However, a potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro peptidomimetic aldehyde inhibitor, TG-0205221, has been shown to block SARS-CoV and human CoV 229E replications (Yang et al., 2006). As shown in this study, we have identified potent and membrane-permeable MERS-CoV inhibitors 6b, 6c and 6d using live MERS-CoV virus with EC50 of 0.6\u20131.2 \u03bcM and S.I. over 71.4. These compounds with IC50 < 0.5 \u03bcM against 3Cpro (Kuo et al., 2008) inhibited 3CLpro of MERS-CoV with IC50 of 1.7\u20134.7 \u03bcM and SARS-CoV with IC50 of 0.2\u20130.7 \u03bcM. Moreover, we found these inhibitors were active against other viruses, including \u03b1- and \u03b2-CoVs with EC50 of 1.1\u201317.7 \u03bcM, but were less potent (higher EC50) in killing human \u03b2-CoV OC43. Although not as potent as inhibiting picornavirus EV71 with the EC50 of 18 and 7 nM for 6c and 6d, respectively (Kuo et al., 2008), they are the most potent inhibitors of live MERS-CoV identified so far. Their inhibitory activities against picornaviruses and CoVs make these compounds broad-spectrum antiviral agents. With the escalating cost of drug discovery, development of an antiviral agent with broad-spectrum activities might help in overcoming financial hurdles. More compounds are being synthesized for lead optimization. Animal study needs to be further conducted for developing one of these potent inhibitors into an antiviral drug.",
