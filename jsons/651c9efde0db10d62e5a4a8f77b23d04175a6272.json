Similar studies of chloroquine were previously done on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showing an EC50 in a comparable range [9] . A recently published comparison study of their in vitro activity demonstrated higher potency of hydroxychloroquine over chloroquine, with EC50 values similar to prior data [10] . The authors utilized physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation techniques and provided a rationale for the optimal dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily) based on their in silico experiment.",

As such, there is significant interest in finding effective prophylaxis, for which hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been considered [17] . In a preprint non-peer reviewed retrospective cohort, veterans who received hydroxychloroquine as treatment for COVID-19 either with or without azithromycin had no reduction in risk of mechanical ventilation [18] . The fact that our patient developed the disease in this context raises questions about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, both as a therapeutic as well as a prophylactic agent [19, 20] . Were hydroxychloroquine effective as prophylaxis, one might expect only mild asymptomatic infection not requiring hospitalization. A critical need exists for further investigation of hydroxychloroquine and other chloroquine derivatives, not only as treatment for COVID-19 disease but also as preventive therapy. Further, the effects of potential confounding factors like age, comorbidities, underlying autoimmune disease, and clinical stage of COVID-19 disease are yet to be determined. More data from larger randomized clinical trials is necessary in order to elucidate these questions.",

A meta-analysis of 6 published articles and 23 ongoing trials primarily in China listed a variety of different regimens being studied [14]. Most recently, an open-label nonrandomized trial by Gautret et al suggested hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times daily for 10 days, with the addition of azithromycin depending on severity of illness [15].

Our patient developed COVID-19 infection despite long-term use of hydroxychloroquine. Her hydroxychloroquine dose was lower compared to any of the proposed dose regimens for COVID-19 treatment or prophylaxis; however, the chronicity of her treatment (3 years) would be expected to mitigate this difference. Considering the long elimination half-life of the drug (30 days) in addition to its known intracellular accumulation, we would expect the intracellular and extracellular levels of hydroxychloroquine in a patient such as ours taking the medication chronically to be relatively comparable to the minimum desired dose for treating COVID-19.",
