This indicates that it is possible to live a life without a sense of smell, albeit it is more dangerous, less pleasant, and food tastes much less interesting. Most common causes for smell loss are sinunasal disease (chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps), acute infections of the upper airways, head trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders. In many people smell loss seems to be due to the aging process. Before treatment olfactory disorders are diagnosed according to cause with the medical history being a big portion of the diagnostic process. Olfactory disorders are in principle reversible, with a relatively high degree of spontaneous improvement in olfactory loss following infections of the upper respiratory tract. Medical treatment is according to cause. It also involves surgical approaches as well as conservative treatments including the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, or smell training. Because today olfactory dysfunction seems to receive more attention than in previous years it can be expected that tomorrow we will have more specific and effective treatment options available. 31 ",

In daily clinical life, these tests serve as quick screening tools for olfac- tory dysfunction [31.64 ]. All olfactory tests should be reliable and valid. Tests apart from screening tools should distinguish between anosmic, hyposmic, and normosmic subjects, respectively, which requires availability of normative data acquired and validated on large samples of healthy and diseased subjects, respectively. In addition, it should be known which change of the test score indicates a clinically significant change of function [31.65] . Most of these requirements apply only to a few olfactory tests [ Olfactometer OMb6 (Burghart, Wedel, Germany) and how stimuli are presented intranasally (courtesy of T. Hummel) adjusted to the various cultures [31.78, 79] , simply because not all odors are known everywhere; for example, many Europeans do not know the smell of wintergreen or root beer, whereas this is well known in the United States.",

To extract event-related potentials (ERP) from the background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, stimuli are presented repeatedly and the individual recordings are then averaged, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (random activity would cancel itself out; nonrandom activation would remain). In addition, stimuli are presented with a steep onset (< 20 ms) in a monotonous environment such that stimulus onset synchronizes the activity of as many cortical neurons as possible. Olfactory ERP are direct correlates of neuronal activation; they have a high temporal resolution in the range of microseconds, and they can be obtained independently of the subject's response bias, they are well-suited for medico-legal investigations [31.110 ]. Based on a system developed by Kobal [31.104, 111] , odors are applied intranasally (Fig. 31.3) . Presentation of odorous stimuli does not produce mechanical or thermal sensations because odor pulses are embed-Part D | 31.7 ded in a constantly flowing air stream [31.104, 112, 113] .

Although there is a very clear concept available as to how to record and analyze olfactory ERP [31.116, 117] recently there have been a number of attempts to improve the signal-to-noise ratio [31.118-120] and to extract additional information from the stimulus-related EEG [31.121, 122] .",

The current explanation is that coup-contre-coup lesions or tearing of the filae ol-factoriae leads to anosmia or hyposmia. Although the entity of posttraumatic olfactory loss has already been described at the end of the last century it has received little systematic attention, like most olfactory disorders [31.154] . Olfactory loss seems to correlate with the severity of the trauma [31.155-157], although several authors pointed out the fact that there is considerable individual variability in terms of the vulnerability of olfactory structures [31.157, 158] . The injured parts of the olfactory system are most often the filae olfactoriae which cross the cribriform plate. However, central structures such as the orbitofrontal cortex and gyrus rectus have also been found to be affected from head trauma [31.147, 155] . Similar to post-URTI olfactory impairment, these patients are prone to develop parosmia and phantosmia several months after the trauma. Clinical experience shows that most patients with posttraumatic olfactory disturbance realize the alteration with some latency [31.159] .",

The subjects have to identify odors at supra-threshold concentrations from a list of descriptors[31.73, 74]. For example, subjects receive a rose odor, and they are asked whether the odor was banana, fish, rose, or coffee; such tasks are no problem for healthy people, but they are very difficult for people with smell loss. The forced-choice procedure controls the patients' response bias. The result of the test corresponds to the sum of the correctly identified items. Smell identification tests are most widely used[31.66- 71, 75]. The more odors the test contains the more reliable it is[31.76, 77]. Identification tests have to be",
