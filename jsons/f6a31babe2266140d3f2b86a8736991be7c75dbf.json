A recent letter to the editor highlighted the risk of total infections, upper 38 respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis in patients with psoriasis on 39 immunomodulating biologic therapy. 1 Similar to psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an 40 inflammatory skin disease managed effectively with biologic agents when disease burden is 41 high. Adalimumab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration 42 (FDA) approved drug for moderate-to-severe HS. In comparison to patients with psoriasis, 43 patients with HS generally require higher doses of adalimumab, especially during treatment 44 initiation. 2 While current data are not available for COVID-19 risk in patients with HS, data from 45 the PIONEER I and II phase 3 clinical trials may provide important insight into the risk of 46 infectious complications in this unique patient population. 3", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Risks of total infections, upper respiratory infections and nasopharyngitis in 87 hidradenitis suppurativa patients taking adalimumab versus placebo.
