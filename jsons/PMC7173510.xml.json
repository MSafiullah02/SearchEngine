In some cases, the adverse effects of drug administration exceed pharmacological effect and despite the concise mechanism of action of the drug over the target molecule representing an improvement in the patient's state, the treatment has to be prevented or discontinued.4 In fact, although a maintained steady increase in the number of launched NCE has been observed in the last years, the question arises whether this classical approach has already exhausted the discovery of innovative molecules.5\n",

However, the delivery of biological entities is sometimes hampered by its low half-life in the bloodstream by unspecific degradation, resulting in an expensive and ineffective process. Nevertheless, some solutions have already been explored for biopharmaceuticals to increase solubility and stability and to reduce immunogenicity including postranslational modifications such as glycosylation and covalent conjugation of polyethylene glycol.6\n",

Highly positively charged peptides containing a large number of arginines or polylysines have been used to promote electrostatic interactions since nucleic acids are highly negatively charged molecules.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Natural DNA-condensing proteins as nuclear histidines or protamines can also be used to bind nucleic acids.22, 23, 24, 25 Protamine, which is the protein that replaces histidines during the spermatogenesis process, is a sperm chromatin component and just as the histidines do, it has very high DNA condensation ability to protect nucleic acids form cytosolic endonucleases.23, 26 In addition, as soon as the complex reaches the cellular nucleus, protamine is degraded by chromatin-remodeling proteins, releasing the transported DNA allowing its expression.15, 23 In contrast, polycationic DNA condensation modules such as polylysines and polyarginines\u2014even they can present higher DNA condensation ability depending on the polycationic chain length\u2014usually present lower DNA-releasing ability, interfering negatively with the accessibility of cellular transcription factors and DNA expression capacity.15\n",

This kind of peptides can be used in the multifunctional protein if specific targeting is not required.33 Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been widely described as unspecific cell-binding and internalization peptides34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 (see also the chapter \u201cPeptide Nanoparticles for Oligonucleotide Delivery\u201d by Lehto et al. in this volume). However, specific interactions can be obtained by incorporating cell receptor ligands if cell or tissue targeting is required for the therapeutic action. Moreover, some of those ligand\u2013receptor interactions promote the ligand\u2013receptor complex internalization. Many peptides have been described in the literature as receptor-specific ligands so any of them can be added to the multifunctional proteins in order to confer them cell specificity.47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 The most natural specific ligands that can also be used for cell targeting are monoclonal antibodies.32, 63, 64, 65 In addition, if no specific peptides are available for an intended target, new specific binding peptides can be found by using phage display66 or combinatorial chemistry.67\n",

            "text": "Several peptides have been described that are able to promote endosomal escape and can be classified into two types depending on their escape mechanism: fusiogenic peptides and histidine-rich peptides.36 The fusiogenic peptides are small peptides that have hydrophobic amino acids (Aa-s) interspersed at constant intervals with negatively charged Aa-s.12, 19, 39, 40, 45, 46, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 Thus, when early endosomes become late endosomes, their low pH induces a conformational change in the peptide, which adopts a alpha-helix structure, in an amphipathic structure able to fuse with the endosomal membrane, leading to pore formation and releasing all the endosomal content into the cell cytoplasm.36 The histidine-rich peptides are small peptides with a high histidine content whose endosmolytic activity is mediated by a mechanism called \u201cproton sponge\u201d.12, 22, 80, 81, 82, 83 When the endosomal pH becomes low in late stages, the imidazole groups of the histidines are protonated and attract endosomal Cl\u2212 ions, buffering against the proton pump. Thus, the endosomes collapse by an osmolytic swelling process and the endosomal content is released to the cell cytoplasm.36 Further details are given in the chapter \u201cPeptide Nanoparticles for Oligonucleotide Delivery\u201d by Lehto et al. in this volume.",

Mutations can be introduced at specific places using site-directed mutagenesis or throughout the gene by random mutagenesis. Several mutagenesis techniques have been developed in order to avoid codon bias.113, 114 The first technique used to mimic evolution was DNA shuffling.115 This method is based on the mixing and subsequent joining of different related small DNA fragments in order to form a complete new gene. In the process of shuffling, the recombination frequency is dependent on the degree of homology. A high level of recombination is important to get all possible combinations of mutations. Since recombination can be biased, several methods to overcome problems arising from the use of shuffling in the early years were tackled by novel strategies, all having their own advantages and disadvantages.112 The products obtained by these methods have to be screened for desired qualities and not all of them can be easily screened.",

            "text": "Rational design of proteins is based on the modification or insertion of selected amino acids or domains in a polypeptide chain backbone to obtain proteins with new or altered biological functions. When using that strategy, a detailed knowledge of the structure and function of the backbone protein is needed to make desired changes. This generally has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically feasible. However, a major drawback of this approach is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable or it can be extremely difficult to predict the effects of various mutations. Modular engineering enables, by using simple DNA recombinant techniques, the construction of chimerical polypeptides in which selected domains, potentially from different origins, provide the required activities. An equilibrate combination and spatial distribution of such partner elements has generated promising prototypes, able to deliver expressible DNA or molecules to tissue culture but also to specific cell types in whole organisms.120 Modular fusion proteins that combine distinct functions required for cell type-specific uptake and intracellular delivery of DNA or drugs present an attractive approach for the development of self-assembling vectors for targeted gene or drug delivery.121 One of the first examples was described by the group of Uherek et al. They combined a cell-specific target module (antibody fragment specific for the tumor-associated ErbB2 antigen), a DNA-binding domain (Gal4), and a translocation domain for endosomal escape.121\n",

The overexpression of structural viral proteins in a convenient expression system renders recombinant proteins capable of being folded and assembled in discrete organized nanoparticles with a defined size corresponding to the natural capsid geometry.187, 188, 189 Moreover, even though VLPs are structurally stable particles, some biochemical and structural studies have observed that viral capsids and bacteriophages may show some structurally dynamic properties varying in shape, size, or rearrangements of the coat proteins, in response to different factors such as pH.190, 191, 192, 193\n",

It has to be taken into account that some attachment of the cargo on the VLP surface can occur.195 Besides, diversity of natural tropism including liver for hepatitis B VLPs, spleen for some papillomavirus and polyomavirus VLPs, antigen-presenting cells for certain papillomavirus VLPs, and glial cells for human polyomavirus JC (JCV) VLPs, among others152 is one of the key advantages offered by VLPs providing a wide spectrum of specific targeting and distribution profiles depending on the directed application. Although each VLP has its own characteristic receptors, entry pathway, and intracellular trafficking, it has been demonstrated that tropism of VLPs could be customized, modifying the residues identified as ligands of the cellular receptor on VLPs\u2019 surface or even varying the delivery routes.155, 189, 203\n",

Thus, a broad spectrum of VLPs could be customized depending on the VLP type, the number of proteins needed for VLP assembling, and the targeted final application.158, 210\n",

It is important to point out that VLPs are tunable nanoparticles that can also be chemically or genetically engineered to modify their natural cellular tropism in order to diversify the range of therapeutic applications in targeted gene or drug delivery.154, 201 Some effective approaches to modify the natural cellular tropism include:(1)Genetic engineering of VLP chimeras incorporating heterologous cell-specific short peptides that contain recognition sites of target cell receptors.232 In this context, polyoma and papillomavirus, with solved atomic structures of their major structural capsid proteins, have been extensively used to obtain chimeric VLPs as delivery vector systems.165, 233 However, this approach has some bioprocessing limitations such as low production levels as a consequence of VLP modification, alterations of size and properties of the VLPs that could affect the structural interactions and conformations for VLP assembly, disassembly and packaging, and low transduction efficiencies.157\n(2)Chemical bioconjugation of purified VLPs with epitope-containing peptides234, 235 or a wide range of small molecules conferring cell-specific targeting such as transferrins, folic acid, or other targeting molecules. As an example, CMPV VLPs have been successfully conjugated with Tfn using \u201cclick\u201d chemistry236 and with NHS-ester-derivatized folic acid, demonstrating both as internalized into HeLa cells and KB cells, respectively.183, 184\n(3)High-throughput library and directed evolution method is a rational approach that has been recently used to engineer viral vectors with the desired tropism properties.237\n(4)Pseudotyping, which consists of replacing the envelope protein of one virus species by the envelope protein of another virus species.238\n(5)Modification of the delivery route of the VLPs. It has been shown that the levels of expression of \u03b2-galactosidase in heart, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, and brain are different depending on the delivery route of polyomavirus VP1 VLPs.203\n\n",

Another relevant issue is the number of active domains to be included in a therapeutic protein carrier, an issue that seems to be relevant for the functionality of the construct. For example, the CPP neutralization of a ligand may depend on the CPP/ligand ratio that is in the vehicle.322 It has also been observed that the integrin binding power of RGD-containing motives increases with the number of RGD domains over the monomer until a maxim of four moieties.323 Another example is Tat activity empowerment when attached to molecules that form tetramers, such as beta-galactosidase108 and p-53.324\n",

Proteins are nanostructures that can form complex high-order entities such as VLPs, resulting in appropriate cages for the internalization of therapeutic molecules. In addition, the design of modular proteins displaying selected functions has been possible by using in silico approximations to the feasibility of recombinant protein production. This approach has demonstrated the versatility of such molecules in the generation of novel delivery nanovehicles opening up the possibility of new functional combinations to enhance the specific interaction with the target tissue. Such tunable specificity in the delivery of drugs, nucleic acids, or other proteins is one of the main properties that make multifunctional proteins appealing as more rational delivery vehicles.",
