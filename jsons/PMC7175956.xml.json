In particular, most detailed tests of evolutionary hypotheses (e.g. Johnson 1998; Fisher et al. 2001) omit bats (Order Chiroptera). Assessments of population trends and extinction proneness have also excluded Chiroptera (e.g. Woinarski et al. 1992; Johnson 2002). This is a significant shortcoming as bats represent over 30% of Australia's mammal species, many of which are endemic.",

An assessment of the response of mammals within this region to 23 environmental variables revealed that a single environmental gradient (of substrate and disturbance) described the distribution of all species, excluding bats (Woinarski et al. 1992). Rock\u2010inhabiting mammals are a significant component of this fauna, however, diversity of this assemblage decreases with decreasing outcrop size and increasing isolation. Woinarski et al. (1992) identified three other trends. First, that the mammal fauna of eucalypt open forest/woodland habitats of north\u2010western Australia is characterized by extensive distributions of its component species. Second, that monsoon forests support a depauperate mammal fauna. Last, that the mammal fauna of this region undergoes substantial latitudinal change associated with a steep north\u2010south rainfall gradient.",

However, data from captures (mist netting, harp trapping, roost searches) indicated that most bat species were present across the environmental range sampled (Woinarski et al. 1992). Here we revisit the issue of the response of bats to environmental variables in the tropical savanna of the Northern Territory and north\u2010west Queensland using a more rigorous data set. Our data collection incorporated the use of ultrasonic detectors to sample bats and geographic information system (GIS) derived variables to represent environmental conditions. The study region supports a rich microbat fauna (26 of Australia's 65 species, 15 of Australia's 20 genera), including one endemic species (Taphozous kapalgensis), and both of Australia's monotypic genera (Rhinonicteris, Macroderma).",

We predicted that the high vagility of bats would result in species responding broadly to environmental variables. However, specific responses to a number of environmental variables were expected. In particular, we predicted that the distribution, composition and segregation of bat assemblages would respond to geographical patterns in annual rainfall, presence of rocky escarpments, water bodies and canopy cover. Although a relationship with insect abundance and composition was examined, we predicted that this relationship would not be significant given the generalist feeding ecology of most insect\u2010eating bats (Fenton 1990).",

Bats were sampled using two (18 sites) or three (21 sites) harp traps over two consecutive nights as well as one night of shot sampling for a 3\u2010h period after dusk. Harp traps were usually placed across \u2018flyways\u2019 (tracks, streams or other gaps within the vegetation where bats are more likely to be trapped) and were either positioned side by side or spaced between 20 and 30 m apart. We also conducted active searches of caves, road culverts and any other features potentially used as diurnal roosts by bats within 400 m of the centre of the sampling site. In addition, bat calls were recorded at every site with ultrasonic bat\u2010detectors (Anabat II, Titley Electronics, Ballina, Australia) using two methods. The first method involved placing a detector on the ground, elevated to approximately 40\u00b0, and operated from dusk for a cumulative total of at least six recording hours over two consecutive nights (maximum 22 h, mean 20 h). This time period has been shown to sample 90% of species calls at a given site (Milne et al. 2004). Detectors were connected to either an Anabat II Delay Switch with output recorded to 90\u2010min cassette tape (Sony Chrome UX, Tokyo, Japan) via tape recorder (Optimus CTR\u2010115 D, Fort Worth, USA) (18 sites) or an Anabat V Zcaim and computer (Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 3440CT or Toshiba Tecra 700CT D, Tokyo, Japan) running Anabat6 software in monitor mode (21 sites). There are no differences in the species detected between these two recording techniques (Milne et al. 2004). For the second method, an Anabat detector was held in the hand and manually activated on detection of a bat\u2010call and actively pointed in the direction of the call. Calls were recorded via tape\u2010recorder and cassette tape, for 3 h after dusk for one night. All recorded calls were identified according to Milne (2002). At several sites (14), shot sampling was not permitted. Instead we trapped bats using mist\u2010nets at these sites. It is likely therefore, that some \u2018high\u2010flying\u2019 bat species that are readily detected using shot sampling, may not have been trapped at these sites. However, we expect this will have a negligible effect on our results as shot sampling at all other sites, used in conjunction with Anabat detectors, enabled us to collect an extensive reference call library for \u2018high\u2010flying\u2019 bat species for the entire study area (Milne 2002). Anabat detectors were systematically used at all sites and will normally detect \u2018high\u2010flying\u2019 species that are not readily trapped (O\u2019Farrell & Gannon 1999).",

On escarpment sites, the transects either traversed the escarpment or were situated at the base of the escarpment. Basal area and stem counts were derived by measuring diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of every tree along the transect, whereas canopy cover was measured using a spherical densiometer at 0 m, 50 m and 100 m along the transect. For the entire site (3.1 ha), we measured slope, maximum canopy height, crown cover, rock cover, distance to water and local roost potential. Crown cover in three height classes (1\u20133 m, 3\u201310 m and >10 m) was estimated using crown separation ratios (McDonald et al. 1998).

Large trees have been shown to contain more tree hollows than smaller trees (Whitford 2002) and are preferred roost sites for many bat species (Lunney et al. 1988; Herr & Klomp 1999; Law & Anderson 2000; Lumsden et al. 2002).",

At the bottom of the funnel a hole was cut in the sheet and a plastic jar (65 mm diameter \u00d7 130 mm depth) partially filled with 70% ethanol was attached to hang underneath. A 12\u2010V fluorescent light (\u2018Col\u2010Light\u2019 brand Col\u2010lite, Maleny, Australia) was hung from the higher end of the sheet to attract insects. The trap was positioned approximately 100 m from the Anabat detector so as not to disturb bats from natural flight habits in the vicinity of the detector, and left unattended for the entire night. Insects that fell into the jar were collected the following morning. In the laboratory, insect samples were filtered through a 2\u2010mm sieve to remove the smallest insects (mostly <3 mm in length) and then identified to order and assigned to four size (head\u2010body length) classes: <5 mm, 5\u201310 mm, 10\u201315 mm and >15 mm.

Compared with the vegetation in the areas sampled by McKenzie and Muir (2000)and Law et al. (1998), the vegetation of the Top End is usually shorter and contains fewer understorey layers (D. Lewis pers. comm. 2004).

Most species occurred in more than one group and some were present in all groups. In addition, there were no associations between insect variables and bat assemblages and relatively few associations with environmental variables. This pattern is not restricted to microbats. Birds, reptiles and non\u2010volant mammals also exhibit \u2018loose\u2019 patterns of species composition (Woinarski & Fisher 1995; Woinarski et al. 2000) and limited associations with particular environments and environmental gradients (Menkhorst & Woinarski 1992; Woinarski et al. 1999) in the Top End. Woinarski et al. (1999) suggested this trend was a consequence of the homogeneity of eucalypt woodlands and forests that dominate the Top End landscape. This relatively uniform environment militates against highly specialized and habitat\u2010specific faunas. However, there were exceptions. Specifically, some microbat species had a clear association with rugged rocky areas, particularly escarpments and adjacent areas. These areas provided a complex mix of habitats that contained foraging and roosting sites suitable for both cave and tree roosting species. This pattern extended to other vertebrate species as well. Rocky escarpment regions in the Top End support high species diversity as well as a number of endemic or habitat restricted species (Woinarski & Gambold 1992; Woinarski et al. 1992).",

Bats are regularly characterized by the foraging strategy they employ within their immediate environment (McKenzie & Rolfe 1986; Neuweiler 1989; Schnitzler & Kalko 1998). Rivers are often associated with environments with tall dense vegetation. These areas do not appear to be of conservation significance because we did not observe high species richness at our \u2018Riparian\u2019 sample sites. However, riverine environments usually have a distinct outer \u2018edge\u2019 and vegetation surrounding these areas is usually shorter and relatively open. We propose that these areas had greater species richness as they provide a diversity of environments for bats that employ different foraging strategies. We recommend that further research be conducted to examine the relationship between rivers and bats in the Top End.",

Bats in the Top End are poorly surveyed and, with few exceptions, surveys have been unstructured and unsystematic. Therefore, attempting to identify and compare historical trends in bat populations is very difficult. Given the Top End environment is (currently) relatively unmodified, it could be assumed that mammal populations will remain stable and secure over the short to medium term. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Woinarski et al. (2001) described a case of decline in terrestrial small mammals in a conservation reserve in the Top End that could not be confidently attributed to any clear environmental factor(s). Further cases have also emerged (e.g. Pardon et al. 2003; Watson & Woinarski 2003). Therefore, we recommend establishing long\u2010term monitoring programs to track changes in bat populations so that changes may be quickly identified, assessed and appropriately managed. This is a highly challenging task that can only be achieved through a considerable commitment of time and resources.",
