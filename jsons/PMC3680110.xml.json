This approach was developed from an earlier concept called ambient analyte immunoassay, which was first introduced by Roger Ekins in 1989 (Ekins, 1989). In the decade that followed, this concept was successfully transformed into the DNA microarray, a technology that determines the mRNA expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel. However, DNA microarray technology possesses some limitations because mRNA profiles do not always correlate with protein expression (Gygi et al., 1999; Zhu and Snyder, 2001; Kopf and Zharhary, 2007). More importantly, proteins are the major driving force in almost all cellular processes. Therefore, protein microarrays were developed as a high\u2010throughput tool to overcome the limitations of DNA microarrays and to provide a direct platform for protein function analyses.",

To distinguish this type of array from antibody arrays, they are divided into two classes: analytical and functional (Chen and Zhu, 2006). Unlike antibody arrays (analytical microarrays), functional protein microarrays are made by spotting all of the proteins encoded by an organism and therefore are useful for the characterization of protein functions, such as protein\u2010protein binding, biochemical activity, enzyme\u2010substrate relationships, and immune responses (Poetz et al., 2005; Chen and Zhu, 2006). More recently, a so\u2010called reverse\u2010phase array has been developed, providing an alternative format to analytical microarrays in which tissue/cell lysates (or fractionated lysates) are used to form such an array (Poetz et al., 2005). An overview of these three categories of protein microarrays is given in Figure 1.",

            "text": "The most representative model of analytical protein microarrays is the antibody array. The first model to demonstrate the application of antibody arrays employed the \u201canalyte\u2010labeled\u201d assay format. In this format, proteins are detected after antibody capture using direct protein labeling (Haab, 2005). Using this format, Knezevic et al. (2001) successfully found alterations in protein expression in cancer cell development. Multiple differences in protein expression could be detected in epithelial and stromal cells using this array format. However, some of its limitations have to be taken into consideration because this method lacks specificity in protein target labeling and has poor sensitivity for low\u2010abundance proteins. Moreover, targeted protein labeling may lead to epitope destruction because of some chemical reactions (Poetz et al., 2005). Another antibody array model provides higher sensitivity using the \u201csandwich\u201d assay format. This format employs two different antibodies to detect the targeted protein (Haab, 2005; Poetz et al., 2005). One antibody, called the capture antibody, immobilizes the targeted protein on the solid phase, while the other antibody, called the reporter or detection antibody, generates a signal for the detection system. Using two antibodies significantly increases the specificity and sensitivity of the \u201csandwich\u201d assay format, even at femtomolar levels (Poetz et al., 2005; Chen and Zhu, 2006). Gonzalez et al. (2011) reported the application of the sandwich assay format to distinguish between two similar samples: blood plasma and serum. They were able to perform high\u2010specificity and high\u2010sensitivity detection using less than 1 \u00b5l of sample with this platform. These assays offer a multiplexed format of the original enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but they can only detect dozens, rather than hundreds, of analytes simultaneously because cross\u2010reactivity between antibodies can occur (Poetz et al., 2005).",

For instance, many antibodies may cross\u2010react with proteins other than their expected target proteins when tested on functional protein microarrays, especially when multiple analyte detection is employed. The need for highly specific antibodies has become a major challenge in the use of analytical protein microarrays (Talapatra et al., 2002; Poetz et al., 2005; Chen and Zhu, 2006) because nonspecific binding will lead to large numbers of false positive results (Talapatra et al., 2002). Another challenge arises from producing a large number of antibodies in a high\u2010throughput fashion. Recombinant antibodies have become a promising means of overcoming this problem; however, they must overcome complex fabrication issues (such as cloning and protein expression) before they can become practical for use in today's research labs (Brichta et al., 2005).",

Significant achievements in providing the whole proteome of several organisms (i.e., human, yeast, \nEscherichia coli\n, virus) on arrays have provided the tools for many important biological discoveries (Zhu and Snyder, 2001; Zhu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2009; Thao et al., 2010). Moreover, protein microarrays enable the study of many post\u2010translational modifications (i.e., phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, S\u2010nitrosylation) in a large\u2010scale fashion, which is critical for understanding cellular protein synthesis and function (Zhu et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2008; Foster et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009).",

This method allows for the analysis of many samples obtained at different states by directly spotting tissue, cell lysates, or even fractionated cell lysates on a glass slide. Many different probes can be tested to specifically identify certain proteins in lysate samples (Poetz et al., 2005). This type of microarray was first established by Paweletz and colleagues to monitor histological changes in prostate cancer patients (Paweletz et al., 2001). Using this method, they successfully detected microscopic transition stages of pro\u2010survival checkpoint protein in three different stages of prostate cancer: normal prostate epithelium, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive prostate cancer. The high degree of sensitivity, precision, and linearity achieved by reverse\u2010phase protein microarrays enabled this method to quantify the phosphorylation status of some proteins (such as Akts and ERKs) in these samples; phosphorylation was statistically correlated with prostate cancer progression. Harnessing this sophisticated technology, Ciaccio et al. (2010) profiled EGF receptor signaling dynamics using micro\u2010western arrays (MWAs), which combine western blotting and reverse\u2010phase protein microarrays to produce better sensitivity by the separation of whole\u2010lysate sample components. This method allowed them to precisely measure 91 phosphosites of 67 proteins at six different time points with five EGF concentrations in A431 human carcinoma cells to analyze the dynamic profile of EGF receptor concentrations. A significant drawback of this approach, however, is that it is highly dependent on the availability and specificity of commercially produced antibodies. Because of this bias, it has limited applications.",

For example,Invitrogen provides a human protein microarray of \u223c9000 full\u2010length human proteins purified individually from insect cells. The quantity and quality of this array is carefully controlled. The major advantage of commercial protein microarrays is that they provide commercial access to researchers who are not familiar with this technology. However, the disadvantages are obvious as well. Most commercial microarrays do not provide full coverage of the proteome (mostly human) or only provide antibodies against a small fraction of the human proteome.

Phage display was one of the early methods developed to generate recombinant antibodies (Carmen and Jermutus, 2002; Brichta et al., 2005). Using antibody\u2010fragment encoding genes (VH and VL) and bacteriophage capsid gene fusion, this technology enables sets of human antibody libraries to be stored in prokaryotic systems where they can be readily expressed by phage infection. Prokaryotic expression systems promise large\u2010scale antibody production in short time periods. In addition, this system generates antibody fragments lacking the Fc domain rather than intact IgG antibodies, eliminating nonspecific binding to the Fc receptor (Knappik and Brundiers, 2009). The recombinant antibodies are expressed and displayed in the phage capsid, and then purified using column chromatography. Recently, other methods have been developed to generate recombinant antibodies in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g., yeast display) or even in vitro environments (e.g., mRNA display, ribosome display), which provide additional advantages for recombinant antibody fabrication (Irving et al., 2001; Chao et al., 2006; Tabata et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The fabrication of functional protein microarrays faces an even bigger challenge because of the need for large amounts of highly purified proteins. Furthermore, to generate functional proteins, biochemical characteristics (such as protein folding and posttranslational modifications) and physical conditions during the purification procedure have to be considered. To overcome these hurdles, high\u2010throughput protein purification protocols have been developed using both \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n (yeast) and \nE. coli\n protein expression systems. Using a batch purification protocol in a 96\u2010well format, >4000 recombinant proteins can be overexpressed and purified in yeast or \nE. coli\n (Zhu et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2012). Because it is challenging for most laboratories to purify large numbers of proteins, Angenendt et al. (2006) developed an alternative technology in protein chip fabrication, dubbed the nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA; unit\nps2702). Spotting plasmid DNAs with capture antibodies allows for the generation of a protein microarray via simultaneous in situ transcription/translation reactions and protein immobilization on the printed slides. A significant benefit of this approach is that the printed template DNA microarray can be stored for a long time, and the resulting protein microarrays are always freshly made. This method allows the generation of up to 13,000 protein spots on one slide without laborious cloning and expression vectors. In addition, our group has developed two strategies to fabricate protein microarrays by directly capturing nascent polypeptides on a solid surface during translation using puromycin. Employing synthetic or in vitro\u2010transcribed RNAs for this strategy, we can produce high\u2010density and high\u2010quality protein microarrays (Tao and Zhu, 2006). However, such arrays have not flourished because of low protein yield and difficulties in producing large proteins (e.g., >60 kD).",

In label\u2010dependent detections, several types of labeling reagents have been developed, such as fluorescent dyes, enzymes, radioisotopes, and liposomes. Fluorescent dyes with narrow excitation and emission spectra, such as Cy3, Cy5, and equivalents, are the most commonly used because they are convenient and provide a wide linear detection range compared with other labeling systems (Hall et al., 2007). Moreover, these fluorescent dyes provide a multicolor detection system, which allows for multiplex assay design. Harnessing the advantage of signal amplification, enzymatic methods offer a significant improvement in signal detection sensitivity. The most popular enzyme is horseradish peroxidase. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) and tyramide signal amplification (TSA) have also been developed to detect low\u2010abundance proteins (Schweitzer et al., 2002; Varnum et al., 2004). For some assays, such as enzymatic reactions, radioisotopes (e.g., 32P, 33P, and 14C) are the most straightforward for detection. However, other labeling methods are preferable to radioisotope labeling because of safety issues (Chen et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2007).",

In addition to these label\u2010free detection systems, the oblique\u2010incidence reflectivity difference (OI\u2010RD) technique permits extremely sensitive detection by measuring the difference in reflectivity between s\u2010 and p\u2010polarization. This method can dramatically speed acquisition of kinetics measurements of protein binding by detecting a tiny change in its physical properties, such as thickness and density (Chen et al., 2001; Evans\u2010Nguyen et al., 2008; Landry et al., 2008).",

            "text": "During the development of various types of assays, it became obvious that surface chemistry plays an important role in the success of a new assay (Table 2). For example, protein\u2010DNA interactions were first performed on yeast proteome microarrays on a nitrocellulose surface (i.e., FAST Slide) with randomly shared yeast genomic DNA fragments (\u223c500 bp) that were labeled with Cy5 (Hall et al., 2004). Later, Hu et al. also found that, among other tested surfaces, the FAST Slide produced the best signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio for detecting interactions between short DNA motifs (36 to 100 bp) and proteins (Hu et al., 2009). In another example, when the Zhu group was developing protein acetylation reactions using 14C\u2010labeled Ac\u2010CoA as a donor, they first tested the HAT activity of the NuA4 acetyltransferase complex using histones H3 and H4 as substrates on FAST Slides, as well as aldehyde\u2010 and Ni\u2010NTA\u2010coated slides (Lin et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011). The results clearly showed that both FAST and nickel surfaces worked, but the FAST surface produced better signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratios. However, the FAST surface was not suitable for phosphorylation reactions because the background noise was too high (Ptacek et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009). Another instance where surface chemistry is vital to assay development is the profiling of cell surface glycans on a lectin microarray. Our group and others have found that the only proper surface for this type of binding assay is a commercial Schott slide, although the exact surface chemistry is proprietary (Hsu et al., 2006; Pilobello et al., 2007; Tao et al., 2008). Several reasons factor into the importance of surface chemistry. First, for low\u2010affinity binding assays (e.g., protein\u2010DNA interactions), a porous surface (e.g., FAST) is likely to retain more proteins and hence improve sensitivity. Second, when radioisotope\u2010labeled small molecules are used, it is important to completely remove unincorporated radioisotopes from the surface to reduce background noise. Excess retention of radioisotopes might explain why phosphorylation assays do not work well on FAST surfaces. Third, in the case of using live cells to probe a lectin microarray, the grafted chemical ligands must not be too repulsive to cells. Other factors, such as protein conformation and stability, can also be affected by surface chemistry. Therefore, whenever a novel assay is to be developed, a variety of surfaces should be tested first in a pilot study.",

Other than Erk2, many other uDBPs show sequence\u2010specific DNA\u2010binding activity, and more intriguingly, many of their consensus sequences are highly similar to those recognized by annotated TFs.

In other words, even though a candidate protein shows a high penetration rate in a small patient cohort, its ability to distinguish a patient sample from the healthy ones often falls apart when applied to a much larger patient population (e.g., >100). Therefore, validation of potential biomarkers using a larger cohort in a double\u2010blind fashion is always desired. However, due to the high cost associated with functional protein microarrays, consumption of a large number of protein microarrays may not be practical. To alleviate this problem, Song et al. (2010) developed a two\u2010phase strategy for rapid identification of biomarkers for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in a cost\u2010effective way. In phase I, the authors fabricated a human protein microarray composed of 5136 individually purified proteins on poly\u2010l\u2010lysine\u2010coated surfaces and quickly identified 11 candidate autoantigens with a relatively small serum collection. In phase II, they fabricated an AIH\u2010specific protein chip with the 11 proteins and obtained autoimmunogenic profiles of serum samples from 44 AIH patients, 50 healthy controls, and 184 additional patients suffering from hepatitis B, hepatitis C, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, or primary biliary cirrhosis. Statistical analyses of these profiles revealed that three antigens, RPS20, Alba\u2010like, and dUTPase, were highly AIH\u2010specific biomarkers, with sensitivities of 47.5% (RPS20), 45.5% (Alba\u2010like), and 22.7% (dUTPase). These potential biomarkers were further validated with additional AIH samples in a double\u2010blind design.",

            "text": "In addition, there have been a series of studies that employed pathogen protein microarrays to profile serological responses following infection. For example, protein microarrays have been developed in bacteria and viruses for biomarker identification in various infectious diseases (Doolan et al., 2008; Luevano et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011; Vigil et al., 2011). These studies clearly demonstrate the power of protein microarrays in the identification of potential biomarkers; however, several shortcomings are repeatedly seen in these studies. For instance, many of these arrays were fabricated using proteins expressed in \nE. coli\n without purification (Doolan et al., 2008; Luevano et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011; Vigil et al., 2011). Since these proteins are contaminated with \nE. coli\n proteins, the sensitivity of the assay is likely reduced because of the high immunogenicity of the contaminating proteins (Chen et al., 2008). As a result, \nE. coli\n lysates had to be used as a blocking reagent to alleviate this problem. Also problematic is that in many of these studies, identified biomarkers were not validated with additional cohorts and therefore, the possibility of overfitting (see Biomarker Identification) was not completely ruled out.",

Given a high\u2010throughput and parallel system, protein microarrays will accelerate new findings in protein interactions for basic research as well as clinical research purposes. One important factor that demonstrates the superiority of this technology compared with other techniques is the reduction of sample volume usage. This factor is especially important for clinical research that uses precious samples, such as human serum. In addition, the high sensitivity and specificity of protein microarrays provides a powerful tool in quantifying and profiling proteins.",
