The secondary antibody was FITC\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse IgG (Dako Ltd, Ely, UK). Osteoclasts were defined as cells expressing the VNR and F\u2010actin rings (Nesbitt and Horton, 1997).

            "text": "Commitment and differentiation of osteoclasts from their precursors is highly complex, and is usually based on studies using rodent or human cells. Osteoclasts are known to be formed from cells of the \u201cmonocytoid lineage,\u201d and precursors have been shown to reside in both the immature colony forming unit population and more mature CD14+ monocytes; a distinct osteoclast lineage precursor, CFU\u2010O, has been proposed to be capable of responding rapidly to RANKL (Atkins et al., 2006). Cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact is also necessary for osteoclast formation since they form by cell fusion rather than endomitosis (Suda et al., 1992). Currently, several cell surface molecules have been reported to be involved in this process and it had been established that RANK signaling together with additional signaling through c\u2010Fms, the receptor for M\u2010CSF, promotes survival, proliferation, and fusion of mononuclear osteoclast precursors (Boyle et al., 2003; Ross and Teitelbaum, 2005; Vignery, 2005). In both co\u2010cultures and M\u2010CSF/RANKL stimulated systems, osteoclast formation proceeds in stages (Quinn and Gillespie, 2005), and at least 20 genes have been shown to regulate osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. Some act during the formation and/or survival of the osteoclast precursor cell (e.g., PU.1, op/CSF\u20101), whereas others mediate either the ability of the precursor cell to undergo differentiation (e.g., RANK, fos) or the adherence and lytic function of mature osteoclasts (e.g., src, CATK) (reviewed in Boyle et al., 2003). Furthermore, the interaction between RANKL, produced by osteoblasts, and its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclast precursors, leads to activation of at least five signaling cascades (inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase (IKK), c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK), p38, extra\u2010cellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK), and Src) that culminate in activation of transcription factors NF\u2010\u03baB and nuclear factor of activated T\u2010cells (NFAT\u20102) (reviewed in Boyle et al., 2003). Additionally, stromal cell\u2010derived factor\u20101 (SDF\u20101 or CXCL12) is a chemokine highly expressed by bone endothelium, marrow stromal cells, and immature osteoblasts and directly promotes early osteoclast development by stimulating precursor proliferation, fusion, TRAP activity, and cell survival by induction of anti\u2010apoptotic transcription factors (Wright et al., 2005).",

Early studies (Addison, 1978; Allen et al., 1981; Ibbotson et al., 1984; Pharoah and Heersche, 1985; Horton et al., 1988; Shigeyama et al., 1996) investigated cat osteoclasts in situ or disaggregated directly from bone and they were shown to express TRAP and the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, and to resorb bone. Recently (Muzylak et al., 2002) demonstrated that the multinucleated cells produced by culture of feline PBMCs in the presence of M\u2010CSF and RANKL, conditions inductive of osteoclast differentiation in other species, are genuine osteoclasts; they express TRAP, resorb bone, and have high levels of \u03b1v\u03b23 and of the proteolytic enzymes, cathepsin K and MMP9. Cells with an identical phenotype, were also observed to form in vitro in this study, confirming our earlier results.",

Previous histological studies (Addison, 1979, 1980) have shown that feline osteoclasts are larger than those from other species, of the order of 300 \u00b5m in diameter, with the number of nuclei often exceeding 100 (Allen et al., 1981; Ibbotson et al., 1984; Pharoah and Heersche, 1985). In contrast, osteoclasts isolated from neonatal mouse bone or grown in vitro are small and frequently have less than five nuclei. These observations are in line with our culture experiments where the largest osteoclasts that we observed had a maximum cell area of up to \u223c13 mm2 after 14 days of culture and often contained several hundred nuclei. These gigantic osteoclasts were functionally highly active, each associated with numerous F\u2010actin rings and resorption lacunae, and frequently resorbed the entire surface of bone slices (the mean area resorbed at pH <7.1 after 14 days culture being greater than 60%). Osteoclasts even formed at the extremes of culture pH studied, especially when \u201cmature\u201d osteoclast cultures had their pH modified; these still resorbed bone though to a diminished extent compared with basal conditions. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which the exaggerated effects of acidosis upon feline osteoclast formation and function are mediated.",

In the diseased oral cavity, pH is likely to be even lower and this raises the question of how \u201cacidosis\u201d impacts the levels of control of osteoclast development and function, the available data only rarely coming from felines. Frick and Bushinsky (2003) found that metabolic acidosis significantly increased the expression of RANKL RNA, correlating with calcium efflux from bone; indomethacin blocked this effect, indicating a role for prostaglandins. Acidosis also increases osteoblastic secretion of PGE2, which is known to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption (Krieger et al., 2000). Several classes of protein could function as extra\u2010cellular pH sensor(s) within the pH range at which extra\u2010cellular acidification activates and stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone, but they are yet to be studied in cat osteoclasts. They include the H+\u2010sensing G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptor, OGR1, which is expressed by osteoclasts and osteoblasts (Ludwig et al., 2003); the acid\u2010sensing ion channels (ASICS), several of which are expressed in bone (Jahr et al., 2005); the P2X2 receptor for extra\u2010cellular ATP (North, 2002), also present in osteoclasts; and the TRP cation channel (van der Eerden et al., 2005). Although the mechanism by which osteoclasts detect pH changes is still elusive, progress has been made in understanding the response of the key resorptive enzymes to extra\u2010cellular acidification, reflected in the data from this study. Acidosis rapidly stimulates the activity of the vacuolar\u2010type H+\u2010ATPase in osteoclasts (Nordstrom et al., 1997) and induces mRNA for carbonic anhydrase II (Biskobing and Fan, 2000). Furthermore, a recent study by Brandao\u2010Burch et al. (2003) shows that acidosis up\u2010regulates mRNA for TRAP and cathepsin K in organ cultures.",

That is, the cat reacts in a qualitatively or quantitatively different manner\u2014an exaggerated osteoclast number and/or size, degree of activation (and hence resorption), growth factor sensitivity, or a response at a different range of pH may be observed.",
