This fact could not be any more real in the current situation regarding the novel coronavirus. In addition, fair and thorough review process should guarantee the final required quality for decision-makers. As an example, we have recently seen a dubious article published (in English) praising the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients.

This prompts the urgent need for high-quality automatic translation to make such extremely valuable information available to medical personnel in as many languages as possible. This is to some extend already under active development, being the WMT Conference (Conference on Machine Translation) the main venue with a specific track for biomedical articles. In the two most recent WMT conferences (2018 and 2019) 1 interesting results were reported for the English/Portuguese and English/Spanish language pairs. For instance, for the English to Spanish, the number of automatic translated sentences judged by humans as better than human translations was larger than the number of human sentences judged better than the automatic ones. When combining the number of times that the best automatic translation was equally good or better than human translation for WMT19, we get an average of 73% of correct translations according to human judgment, with surprising 90% for EN/ES (English/Spanish) and 82.09% for ZH/EN (Chinese/English). This strengthens our point that automatic translation can indeed be used to aid dissemination of biomedical scientific content.",

In addition, we also checked the countries of publication, which could give an idea of Medline's geographical coverage, which are shown in Figure 1 Medline is usually seen as a quality indicator. However, regional databases may not always follow such quality criteria. For instance, Yiigle database does not explicit their inclusion criteria, thus one cannot be certain about peer-reviewing, for instance. The LILACs database, on the other hand, has a very similar selection and permanence criteria to Medline 3 , including peer-reviewing and geographical concentration of the editorial board.",

This is of critical importance as well, such that the content is properly scrutinized before being published. As an example, we can draw special attention to the peer-review step, which can be troublesome in regional journals. For instance, some Brazilian journals indexed in LILACs and Medline may carry the whole reviewing process in Portuguese, and then translating the article when it is approved. Thus, peer-review is done predominantly by researchers of Portuguese-speaking countries, which can introduce bias. Another concerning example is regarding to tightly controlled, or under embargo, countries, such as China or Iran, where researchers may not have easy access to international content (Normile, 2017; Saeidnia & Abdollahi, 2013) , also introducing a critical bias.",

This could bias the peer-review since people from the same research group/laboratory probably share the same opinions, and they should be \"weighted\" accordingly. Some more \"subjective\" biases may be related to affiliation, when an author is from a prestigious research group or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 university, the review may be less scrutinized. A good example of bias reduction is the computer science field, which has greatly improved in the past years, with submissions to most of its conferences being double-blind reviewed and sometimes the complete peerreview process is published along with the paper.

But making scientific articles alone more accessible is not enough for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, we need also to ensure that this information was well (and fairly) scrutinized. Therefore, editorial boards of journals and scientific databases should also seek good practices in guaranteeing good quality editorial work, for instance by ensuring a heterogeneous peer-reviewing process (reviewers from different countries and institutions) and transparent rules for such selection. Members of the research community could also engage in the discussion of creating such set of recommendations for peer-reviewing and making them official.",
