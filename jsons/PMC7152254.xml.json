To intervene successfully to treat existing infections and prevent the onset of new ones, disease surveillance systems need to provide a continuous, accurate, and near real-time overview of a population's health. Surveillance systems must be sensitive in terms of their ability to detect outbreaks and other significant changes in community health status over time, and they must be flexible in adapting to changing health intelligence needs. Given the increasing pace of international travel and globalization and the threat of intentional outbreaks, surveillance activities need to extend beyond the monitoring of disease burden to include the capacity to quickly recognize unusual, unexpected, or unexplained disease patterns. Because many emerging infectious agents are zoonotic, it is also important to integrate veterinary disease reporting networks into systems that monitor diseases of humans.",

In the United States, surveillance for notifiable diseases is conducted by state and local health departments, which receive reports from physicians, nurses, and laboratorians who are often the first to observe and report unusual illnesses or syndromes. States voluntarily report nationally notifiable diseases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS). To expedite national disease reporting, CDC, in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), has developed a standards-based system for collecting and distributing electronic disease reports from local health departments to state and federal public health authorities. The infectious disease surveillance component of this developing Public Health Information Network (PHIN) is the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). NEDSS is designed to standardize and facilitate the collection of electronic disease information on nationally notifiable diseases within local health jurisdictions directly from health-care providers to local health authorities.23 Limited resources have, however, precluded the establishment of a fully integrated health surveillance system that connects health departments and care providers.",

Several provider-based sentinel surveillance networks were established in collaboration with emergency room physicians, infectious disease specialists, and travel medicine specialists to provide early warning of events that might be missed by public health surveillance. Additional enhancements to the surveillance effort include development of the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (PulseNet) as an early warning system for foodborne diseases, support for the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strengthened surveillance for diseases of current concern (e.g., West Nile encephalitis), and surveillance for outbreaks that might be due to acts of bioterrorism.",

During the 56th World Health Assembly (WHA), two resolutions were passed, one specific to SARS (WHA56.29) and the other adding impetus to the revision efforts (WHA56.28). The resolutions seek to secure enhanced collaboration with WHO in responding to infectious disease outbreaks. In recognition of the role of animals in the spread of human disease and the potential for infectious disease dissemination due to international travel and trade, the resolution prompted by the SARS experience also urges member states to \u201censure collaboration, when appropriate, with veterinary, agricultural and other relevant agencies involved in animal care and research on, and planning and implementation of, preventive and control measures.\u201d31\n",

Although each of these requirements may be a limiting factor in the recognition of emerging infections, the availability of high-quality diagnostic reagents may be the most critical, especially for viral diseases. Laboratories often have adequate reagents for diseases known to occur locally but not for viral illnesses that occur in other parts of the world. Ensuring the quality of serologic tests also requires inclusion of positive and negative control sera that might be difficult to obtain, especially for diseases of low incidence. If reagents are not commercially available, the laboratory must rely on its own locally produced reagents or on reagents supplied by others that may not have benefited from appropriate quality control during production. For some agents, such as influenza, dengue, and hantaviruses, commercially available diagnostic kits that can be used in settings with minimal laboratory facilities have overcome this obstacle.

Disease intelligence relies on formal and informal networks for dissemination and sharing of timely, accurate information on occurrences and outbreaks of infectious diseases and diffusion of prevention recommendations. One of the key lessons that emerged from the 2003 global SARS epidemic was the importance of networks of laboratory scientists, clinicians, and public health experts, aided by electronic communications, in rapidly generating the scientific basis for public health action. It was the \u201cvirtual\u201d international network of laboratories, linked by a secure web site and daily teleconferences, that identified the causative agent and developed early diagnostic tests. The laboratory network served as a model for groups of clinical and epidemiologic experts who shared and compiled the data needed to track the outbreak and assess the effectiveness of containment measures.",

Technologies developed and enhanced over the last several years have stimulated the creation of web-based public health tools for improving national and international disease reporting and facilitating emergency communications. In the United States, CDC communicates breaking surveillance information to public health officials through two electronic networks: the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X), a secure mechanism for sharing health surveillance information on outbreaks and other unusual events, and the Health Alert Network (HAN), which links local, state, and federal health agencies and provides an electronic platform for emergency alerts and long distance training. In similar fashion, the Eurosurveillance Project, funded by the European Commission, promotes the diffusion and exchange of information on communicable diseases in Europe. Globally, WHO shares information through the Outbreak Verification List distributed weekly by electronic mail, the WHO Disease Outbreak News on the WHO web site, and the Weekly Epidemiological Record. Supplementing these mechanisms are less formal networks of individuals and organizations, such as GPHIN, the web-based application that scans global electronic news media for information on health risks and the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), a web-based reporting system.",

Any outbreak of a novel or reemerging infectious disease is likely to be characterized by scientific uncertainties and high levels of concern that public health officials will be challenged to harness and guide. Since the 2001 anthrax attacks and the 2003 global SARS outbreaks, CDC and WHO have been actively involved in efforts to incorporate risk communication into public health practice.",

The best defense against these mobile and resilient pathogens is timely and reliable infectious disease information obtained through global public health surveillance.29 The international community has made important strides in developing networks for detecting and reporting infectious disease events and enhancing capacity for clinical and laboratory surveillance. Continued commitment and support are needed to optimize the use of these systems to improve the detection of unusual disease events, strengthen the ability to share disease intelligence, and inform prevention and containment efforts.",
