            "text": "Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of enveloped, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses. MHV utilizes its surface spike (S) glycoprotein to initiate infection by interacting with a specific cellular receptor (Williams et al., 1991). This interaction triggers a conformational change of the spike, resulting in exposure of its fusogenic domain, which further triggers fusion between viral envelope and plasma membrane and subsequent release of the nucleocapsid into cytoplasm (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002). In some MHV strains, virus entry occurs following receptor-mediated endocytosis (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997). The precise process of virus uncoating is not clear, but is believed to involve dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid (N) protein and dissociation of N protein from viral genomic RNA (Kalicharran et al., 1996). The incoming viral genomic RNA is then translated into the viral polymerase polyprotein of more than 800 kDa that is essential for subsequent viral replication and transcription.",

In the CNS, MHV infection causes encephalitis and demyelination. Because the pathology of demyelination caused by MHV infection resembles those of multiple sclerosis (MS) seen in humans, MHV has been extensively used as an animal model for MS and other neurodegenerative diseases (Lampert et al., 1973, Herndon et al., 1977). Following MHV infection, mice usually develop acute encephalitis and demyelination during the first week of infection (Woyciechowska et al., 1984). Most of the viruses are cleared from the CNS at the end of the second week post-infection (p.i.). If the mice survive the acute phase, chronic demyelination then develops and reaches to a peak at around 30 days p.i. At this time, however, infectious virus can no longer be isolated but viral RNAs are still detectable in the CNS (Fleming et al., 1993, Adami et al., 1995). Viral RNA can persist in the CNS, especially in astrocytes, for an extended period of time (Adami et al., 1995, Perlman and Ries, 1987, Rowe et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Astrocytes play important roles in supporting the nervous system and controlling the chemical and ionic environment of the CNS. Astrocytes can be stimulated to produce diverse pro-inflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide (Van Wagoner and Benveniste, 1999, Huang et al., 2000, Chen and Swanson, 2003). It has been shown that MHV infection can induce the expression of transforming necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinases, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in astrocytes (Kyuwa et al., 1994, Joseph et al., 1993, Zhou et al., 2001, Grzybicki et al., 1997). Infection of astrocytes with MHV may thus modulate the development of the CNS pathology and alter the course of the disease. In vitro, MHV can persist in the DBT astrocytoma cell line, in the progenitor oligodendrocyte/astrocyte CG-4 cells and in a fibroblast 17Cl-1 cell line (Chen and Baric, 1995, Liu and Zhang, 2005, Maeda et al., 1995, Sawicki et al., 1995). However, the precise mechanisms of viral persistence in animal CNS and in cultured cell lines are not known. Previous studies have suggested that alteration of receptor expression in DBT and 17Cl-1 cells by MHV infection may facilitate viral persistence (Chen and Baric, 1996, Porntadavity et al., 2001, Sawicki et al., 1995). In our previous analysis on cellular gene expression in MHV-infected DBT cells using the DNA microarray technology, we suggested that alterations of the expression of cellular genes, in addition to the receptor down-regulation, might play an important role in establishing persistent infection in DBT cells (Cai et al., 2003).",

            "text": "One of such candidate cellular factors is the early growth regulator-1 (Egr-1). Egr-1 is also named as nerve growth factor induced-A (NGFI-A), zif268, TIS8, or Krox24, which is an immediate early gene, the prototype of a family of zinc-finger transcription factors (Waters et al., 1990, Changelian et al., 1989, Christy and Nathans, 1989, Varnum et al., 1989, Lemaire et al., 1990). Egr-1 can be rapidly induced by diverse stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, cytokines, neurotransmitters and injurious stimuli through different mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK pathways depending on the stimuli (Sukhatme et al., 1988, Cao et al., 1990, Cao et al., 1992, Lim et al., 1998, Milbrandt, 1987, Honkaniemi et al., 1995). For example, Egr-1 gene expression is induced through ERK signal pathway by cytokines and growth factors, while it is induced via p38 and JNK pathways by stress treatment such as heat shock, sodium arsensite, ultraviolet, radiation, and anisomycin (Santiago et al., 1999, Liu and Zhang, 2005). As a transcription factor, Egr-1 contains a DNA binding domain, which binds specifically to the consensus binding sequence GCG (T/G) GGGCG (Cao et al., 1990). Egr-1 can induce the expression of a number of genes, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (Delbridge and Khachigian, 1997, Khachigian et al., 1996, Harrington et al., 1991, Kramer et al., 1994, Skerka et al., 1995, Maltzman et al., 1996). All of these genes contain one or more Egr-1 consensus binding sites within their promoter regions. Thus, Egr-1 is involved in regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, neuronal plasticity, vascular wound response, and cancer progression (Hill and Treisman, 1995, Nguyen et al., 1993, James et al., 2004, Khachigian et al., 1996, Kobayashi et al., 2002). For examples, it has been demonstrated that astrocyte growth is regulated by neuro-peptides through basic fibroblast growth factor and Egr-1 (Hu and Levin, 1994, Biesiada et al., 1996); Egr-1 was significantly increased in prostate carcinoma and treatment with anti-Egr-1 anti-sense dramatically inhibited the prostate cancer progression, suggesting a role for Egr-1 in the development of prostate cancer (Eid et al., 1998, Baron et al., 2003a, Baron et al., 2003b).",

We found that both mRNA and protein levels of Egr-1 were significantly induced in DBT cells by MHV infection, which was mediated through the ERK signal pathway. Moreover, the ability of MHV strains to induce Egr-1 expression was correlated with their ability to cause persistent infection in the CNS. Our data may thus suggest a link between the induction of Egr-1 gene expression and the establishment of viral persistence in DBT cells. These findings may also provide insight into the mechanisms by which MHV establishes persistence in the DBT cells and in animal CNS.",

We found that the expression of a substantial number of genes was altered by MHV infection. Among them, the expression of the transcription factor Egr-1 was increased more than 9-fold (data not shown). To verify the microarray data, we used RT-PCR to directly determine the Egr-1 mRNA during the course of virus infection. DBT cells were infected with MHV-JHM strain at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. The intracellular RNAs were isolated at various time points p.i. cDNAs were synthesized by RT with a random primer and were amplified by PCR using a primer pair specific to Egr-1 or \u03b2-actin as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cDNAs representing Egr-1 gene were not induced at 4 h p.i., but were dramatically increased (a 46-fold increase) at 8 h p.i., and peaked at 12 h p.i. At 16 h p.i., the level of Egr-1 mRNA appeared to decline. In contrast, the level of \u03b2-actin mRNA remained relatively constant from 4 to 16 h p.i. These results demonstrate that the expression of Egr-1 gene was induced by MHV infection at the transcriptional level, which confirmed the finding obtained from microarray analysis.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, Egr-1 mRNA was induced by infection with the live virus at 8 and 12 h p.i. Although infection with UV-inactivated virus did not significantly induce Egr-1 expression at 8 h p.i., it did so by 12 h p.i. (\u2248 20-fold increase as compared to mock-infected cells), indicating that virus replication is not absolutely required for Egr-1 induction.

            "text": "It has been previously reported that both p38 and JNK MAPKs were activated in DBT cells infected with MHV-JHM during viral replication (Banerjee et al., 2002). It has also been shown that ERK was activated in peritoneal exudative macrophages at a very early time point of infection (5 min p.i.) with MHV-3 (McGilvray et al., 1998). As described in the introduction, Egr-1 can be induced by all three MAPK pathways. It was therefore interesting to determine whether MHV-induced Egr-1 gene expression was mediated through one or more of the three MAPK signaling pathways. To address this question, we determined the activation of Egr-1 by MHV infection following the treatment of cells with inhibitors specifically inhibiting one of the three MAPK pathways. UO126 is the inhibitor of the ERK pathway, whereas SB203580 and SP600125 are the inhibitors of p38 and JNK pathways, respectively (Cuenda et al., 1995, Bennett et al., 2001, Favata et al., 1998). DBT cells were treated with UO126 (25 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcM), SB203580 (40 \u03bcM), SP600125 (40 \u03bcM), or DMSO (as a negative control) for 1 h prior to infection, during and throughout the infection. Cells were infected with MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. Intracellular RNAs were harvested at 12 h p.i., and Egr-1 mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of cells with UO126 at either concentration (25 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcM) almost completely blocked the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection. By contrast, treatment with SB203580 or SP600125 failed to block Egr-1 induction by MHV infection. To verify this finding, we used a new inhibitor, CI-1040, which has been shown to be even more specific and potent to the ERK pathway (Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999). We found that treatment of DBT cells with CI-1040 (3\u20135 \u03bcM) blocked the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection to a level similar to those treated with UO126 at 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 3B). We thus conclude that induction of Egr-1 gene expression by MHV infection was likely mediated through the MEK-ERK signal pathway.",

To provide direct evidence for the activation of the ERK pathway, we determined the phosphorylation status of ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) following MHV infection. Because it is well known that serum can stimulate ERK activation, DBT cells were subjected to serum-starvation for 24 h prior to virus infection. DBT cells were then infected with gradient-purified MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. After 1 h binding at 4 \u00b0C, the viral inoculums were removed. Cells were fed with fresh medium without serum and were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. At various time points as indicated, cell lysates were prepared for determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4\n, although ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected in both virus-infected and mock-infected cells at all time points p.i., the levels of phosphorylation were significantly higher in virus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells from 5 to 120 min p.i. Moreover, no increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected in virus-infected cells at 0 min p.i. Taken together, these data indicate that the ERK signal pathway was indeed specifically activated by MHV-JHM infection.",

A recent report showed that BNip3 gene expression was down-regulated by over-expression of Egr-1 in prostate cancer cells (Virolle et al., 2003). Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the down-regulation of BNip3 in MHV-infected DBT cells is also mediated through the induction of the transcription factor Egr-1. First, we determined the BNip3 promoter activity by using the luciferase reporter assay (Cai et al., 2003). We expressed Egr-1 protein transiently in DBT cells by cotransfecting pBS-CMV-Egr-1, which contains the Egr-1 ORF under the control of a CMV promoter, and pGL3-BNip3 reporter plasmid (Bruick, 2000, Cai et al., 2003). After 20 h post-transfection, cell lysates were harvested and luciferase activity determined. Results showed that transient cotransfection with an increased amount of Egr-1-expressing plasmid (ranging from 20 to 500 ng per well) exhibited an increased inhibitory effect on BNip3 promoter activity by 2 to 45% (Fig. 5A). This inhibition appeared to be specific for Egr-1 because cotransfection with the empty vector pBS-CMV (without expressing the Egr-1) did not have any effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 5A). The specific inhibitory effect of the expressed Egr-1 on pGL3-BNip3 reporter was further examined in a cotransfection experiment, in which pBS-CMV-Egr-1 or pBS-CMV and the pSV-\u03b2-gal reporter plasmid (which is under the control of an SV40 promoter) were cotransfected into DBT cells. At 24 h post-transfection, \u03b2-gal activity was determined. In stark contrast to the result for pGL3-BNip3 reporter (Fig. 5A), the \u03b2-gal activity was virtually unaffected by the expression of Egr-1 (Fig. 5B). Thus, over-expression of Egr-1 selectively inhibited BNip3 promoter activity.",

Equal numbers of these cloned cells were cotransfected with pGL3-BNip3 reporter plasmid and pSV-\u03b2-gal plasmid, the latter of which served as a control for transfection efficiency as well as for specificity. At 24 h post-transfection, luciferase and \u03b2-gal activities in the cells were determined, and the luciferase activity was normalized to \u03b2-gal activity, which was essentially unaffected by the cotransfection. As shown in Fig. 5D, BNip3 promoter activity was decreased approximately 45% in Egr-1\u20132 clone, while it decreased only 7% in Egr-1\u20131 clone as compared to those in vector-control cells (lane pcDNA3). These results demonstrate that over-expression of Egr-1 repressed the expression of the pro-apoptotic BNip3 gene, thus suggesting that the previously observed down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells by MHV-infection was likely mediated through up-regulation of Egr-1 expression.",

Cells were transfected with an Egr-1-siRNA or a non-specific EGFP-siRNA, the latter of which serves both as a negative control and for monitoring the transfection efficiency. At various times post-transfection, the protein level of Egr-1 was monitored by Western blot analysis. A representative result obtained at 60 h post-transfection is shown in Fig. 6A. In the absence of virus infection, the Egr-1 level was significantly lower in Egr-1-siRNA-transfected cells than in EGFP-siRNA-transfected cells, demonstrating the effectiveness and specificity of the Egr-1-siRNA. Similarly, Egr-1 expression was effectively blocked by Egr-1-siRNA but not by EGFP-siRNA even in the presence of virus infection. Egr-1 protein was much higher in virus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells when the cells were transfected with the EGFP-siRNA, further confirming that MHV infection induces Egr-1 expression. We then determined the effect of Egr-1 knockdown on virus propagation. Indeed, knockdown of Egr-1 expression by Egr-1-siRNA exhibited a detrimental effect on virus propagation, reducing the virus titer by approximately 2 log10 (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, apoptotic cells were increased in virus-infected, Egr-1 knockdown cells as compared to the control cells that were transfected with the EGFP-siRNA (Fig. 6C). Although the increase was statistically significant (p\n = 0.037), the level of the increase was extremely low, which may result from a number of factors. For example, in siRNA-expressing cells, not only was Egr-1 much lower (Fig. 6A) but also was the virus replication (Fig. 6B). Thus, very low level of virus replication might not be able to induce robust apoptosis. Nevertheless, these results indicate that Egr-1 may play a role in virus replication and cell survival.",

DBT cells were infected with different strains of MHV (including MHV-JHM, -A59 and MHV2) or mock-infected. Total intracellular RNAs were isolated at different time points p.i. as indicated, and the RNA level of Egr-1 gene was determined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7A, Egr-1 mRNA was induced (approximately 3 fold) by both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 at 8, 12, and 16 h p.i., but not at 4 h p.i. In contrast, infection with MHV-2 failed to induce Egr-1 expression as compared to those of mock-infected cells (compare lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16 with lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13 in Fig. 7A). We also performed Western blot to detect the protein expression.

            "text": "How is the Egr-1 expression induced by virus infection? In HTLV-transformed cells, it appears that the Tax protein is responsible for the induction of Egr-1 expression (Fujii et al., 1991). As a transactivator, Tax can interact with the transcription factor CREB/ATF and serum response factors (SRFs) (Suzuki et al., 1993, Fujii et al., 1992). These factors in turn interact with the CREB/ATF response element (CRE) and serum response element (SRE), respectively, on the promoter of Egr-1, thus activating the expression of Egr-1 (Fujii et al., 1991, Sakamoto et al., 1992). In the case of MHV-infected cells, we demonstrated the activation of ERK by MHV infection and the inhibition of Egr-1 expression by the MEK1/2 inhibitors (Fig. 4, Fig. 3). Our results thus suggest that the induction of Egr-1 expression upon MHV infection is likely mediated through the ERK signaling pathway. It is well established that the activation of ERK can activate its downstream transcription factor Elk, which then interacts with SRFs and activates a number of immediate-early genes whose promoters contain an SRE. Therefore, we postulate that the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection might follow the ERK1/2 \u2192 Elk \u2192 SRFs \u2192 Egr-1 pathway. The upstream signal(s) that activates ERK1/2 has not been determined in this study although the inhibitor that we used to block ERK activation acts on the upstream kinase MEK1/2. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the upstream signal(s) most likely resides within or in the vicinity of the cytoplasm membranes, which is activated during virus entry. There are two pieces of evidence supporting this interpretation. First, infection with UV-inactivated virus was still capable of inducing Egr-1 transcription (Fig. 2). Second, ERK1/2 was activated within 5 min upon virus entry and during the first 2 h p.i. (Fig. 4). Although live virus is a stronger inducer for Egr-1 expression than UV-inactivated virus, ERK1/2 activation was no longer detected at 3 h following infection (data not shown). This suggests that although virus replication may play a role in the induction of Egr-1 activation, the predominant signal that activates Egr-1 expression is likely triggered during cell entry. Activation of ERK1/2 has also been observed between 5 and 45 min p.i. in peritoneal exudative macrophage infected with MHV-3 (McGilvray et al., 1998). Although Banerjee et al. (2002) did not detect ERK1/2 activation after 2 h p.i., they did not perform the same experiments at earlier time points.",

            "text": "Despite different mechanisms for Egr-1 induction by diverse groups of viruses as discussed above, the finding that Egr-1 is up-regulated by these different viruses may suggest that infections by these viruses may have some common consequences on both viruses and host cells. One of the potential consequences is to facilitate virus replication in the host cells. Indeed, knockdown of Egr-1 by siRNA significantly impaired MHV propagation (Fig. 6B). It has also been reported that there is a good correlation between Egr-1 and viral RNA expressions in the mouse brains infected with Rabies and Borna disease viruses, which raises the possibility that Egr-1 expression may induce some phenotypic changes in neurons that render them more susceptible to viral replication (Fu et al., 1993). The other potential consequence of Egr-1 induction is to promote host cell proliferation and survival. It has been suggested that the induction of Egr-1 expression in EBV-infected B lymphocytes, in EBV-transformed lymphoma and in HTLV-transformed cell lines, may facilitate cell growth and may play a role in tumorigenesis (Calogero et al., 1996, Fujii et al., 1991, Sakamoto et al., 1992). It has also been suggested that the expression of Egr-1 may change the phenotype of the infected cells, which may help KHSV to establish latency (Sun et al., 2001). By analogy, the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection may also facilitate the survival of the infected cells, thereby promoting the establishment of MHV persistence in glial cells. In support of this hypothesis is our finding that over-expression of Egr-1 suppresses the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BNip3 (Fig. 5) that is down-regulated by MHV infection as demonstrated in our previous study (Cai et al., 2003), whereas knockdown of Egr-1 leads to apoptosis when cells are infected with MHV (Fig. 6C).",

Both JHM and A59 are able to cause acute encephalitis and demyelination and persistence in the CNS, whereas MHV-2 cannot. Recent studies from our laboratory and others suggest that the ability of MHV strains to cause acute encephalitis is correlated with their ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, in primary mouse astrocytes and microglia (Li et al., 2004, Yu and Zhang, in press). Interestingly, an Egr-1 binding site has been found in the TNF-\u03b1 promoter region; it has also been shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of TNF-\u03b1 was mediated through the activation of Egr-1 by ERK1/2 in macrophage (Kramer et al., 1994, Shi et al., 2002). Our most recent study indicated that infection of primary mouse astrocytes with JHM also induced Egr-1 expression (Cai and Zhang, unpublished results). It remains to be seen whether Egr-1 is involved in regulation of TNF-\u03b1 induction by MHV infection in these cells. In addition, it has been shown previously that there is a general correlation between MHV persistence and demyelination disease in the mouse CNS (Das Sarma et al., 2000), which is also correlated with the ability of MHV strains to induce Egr-1 expression as found in this study. However, a firm establishment of such a correlation requires further extensive experimentations in animals, i.e. using Egr-1 gene-knockout mice. Nevertheless, our current observation may offer some interesting clues for future investigation on the mechanism by which signal transduction pathways are differentially regulated by MHV strains.",

The PCR products were directly cloned into pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), resulting in pTA-Egr-1. The sequence of the clone was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing (IBI, Prizm-377) in the Departmental Core Facility. pTA-Egr-1 DNA was then digested with EcoRI and XhoI and directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), generating pcDNA3/Egr-1. To generate pBS-CMV-Egr-1 plasmid, the pcDNA3/Egr-1 DNA was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the plasmid pBS-CMV.",

Briefly, DBT cells were seeded in a 24-well culture plates at a density of 4 \u00d7 105 cells per well. When the cells reached to approximately 60% confluency, \u2248 500 ng of plasmid DNAs and 3 \u03bcl of the LipofectAmine reagent were diluted separately in 100 \u03bcl of serum-free OPTI medium without antibiotics, mixed, and incubated at RT for 30 min before adding to each well of the 24-well plate. DBT cells were washed with PBS and 300 \u03bcl of OPTI medium was added to each well of the cell culture. The DNA-lipofectAmine mixture (200 \u03bcl) was added to each well and the cell culture plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for various time periods as indicated. For luciferase assay, cells were harvested along with culture medium and lysed by freezing and thawing. The cell lysate (100 \u03bcl) was assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies). For \u03b2-galactosidase assay, the medium was removed and the monolayers were washed twice with PBS after 24 h post-transfection. The cells were harvested into microfuge tubes by scraping the cells. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000\u00d7g for 10 s at RT. 125 \u03bcl lysis buffer (0.25 M Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0) was added into the tubes. The cells were lysed by freezing at \u2212 70 \u00b0C and thawing at 37 \u00b0C three times. The cell extract was recovered by centrifuging at 12,000\u00d7g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. For each sample to be assayed, the following reagents were mixed together: 3 \u03bcl of 100\u00d7 Mg solution (0.1 M MaCl2, 4.5 M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol), 66 \u03bcl of 1\u00d7 ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside), 30 \u03bcl of cell extract and 201 \u03bcl of 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). The reaction was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The reaction was then stopped by adding 500 \u03bcl of 1 M Na2CO3. The optical density of the reaction was read at a wavelength of 420 nm.",
