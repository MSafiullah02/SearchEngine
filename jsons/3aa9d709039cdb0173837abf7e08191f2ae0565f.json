In order to contain the rising morbidity and mortality, governments are pursuing policies from those that restrict travel, to policies that ensure a nationwide lockdown [7] . With a plummeting global economy, there is an increasing concern regarding the state of the global financial system. A recent study ascertains the economic impact of the pandemic on GDP growth, mentioning that every month of shutdown could cost approximately 2-2.5% of global GDP growth [3] . Although public health recovery is in progress, the rising number of cases of the virus and its uncontrollable transmission has caused uncertainty among private and public sectors about how or when to continue day to day operations in order to begin economic recovery. While the WHO Director-General and IMF Managing Director recently mentioned that the trade-off to save lives or save livelihoods is a false dilemma [7] , for getting the right balance the intervention must take place at the policy level which not only ensures restoration of public health but also incorporates strategies to mobilize economic operations by limiting enforced lockdowns within countries.",

Certain characteristics of the population in these nodes have been modeled as parameters for the system dynamics model. These parameters are optimized to find a partial shutdown that satisfies healthcare constraints as well as economic viability.",

A state's population comprises of a susceptible population, infected population and a recovered population which changes with time. The population dynamics is centered around the question of how the susceptible population S might get exposed to the disease and enters the bucket E. After an incubation period the exposed become infected, I which is followed by recovery R [3] . Each state has health care facilities with health care capacities, H which can vary from 1% to 2% of the state's population [13] . We evaluate the system from a point where a few people in each state are already infected, since our interest lies more heavily on the rise in infection and it being controlled by practicing a partial lockdown. We do not intend to do a micro level observation of the disease transmission and therefore, we directly employ the transmission rate of COVID-19 from modeling as well as other related aggregate data.",

Given that the dynamics of the SEIR model is higly non-linear, the NSGA-2 algorithm is ideal for optimization. Moreover, this algorithm provides the pareto front when there are more than one objective functions. The objectives used here are: 1) Cost to the economy 2) Average number of infected people over the period of policy For each candidate policy which represents one individual in the genetic algorithm (GA), we use the system dynamics model to predict the number of infected people and hence the cost to the economy. These objectives act as the fitness values needed for the GA. The lockdown policy is kept constant for a period of time (say 1 week) and is determined statewise. We assume lockdown is represented by 0 and no-lockdown as 1. Thus, the optimization is done over the domain of binary matrices of size S \u00d7 T where, S is the set of states and T is the time periods with each element determining the state of lockdown at a given state and period of time.

We generate results for a period of 300 days for a certain policy decision to demonstrate the effect of lockdown and social distancing on the infection curve. Without a complete lockdown, the infection peaks early (Figure 3 ) but applying social distancing causes the curve to flatten (Figures 4  and 5) . On the other hand, when a complete lockdown is in effect the curve flattens completely. The Figure 6 shows a situation where people might not conform to social distancing measure during a no lockdown policy. They only follow social distancing (Step social distancing) when a collective threshold of infected population is reached. Even though people follow social distancing after knowing that a large population is infected, the delay in intervention leads to early rise in overall infected population. Figures 7 and 8 show the effect of change in lockdown policy. The figure 7 shows the number of infected people, if the lockdown is implemented after 22 days from the first infection and then removed after 150 days. This shows a flatten curve but also shows a rise in infected population later in time. The curve 8 shows infected population if the lockdown is implemented for 22 days and then removed after 22 days: this leads to a sharp early rise in the number of infected population.",
