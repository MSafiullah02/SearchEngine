            "text": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world [1]. The development of ASCVD is strongly influenced by environmental factors including smoking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and alcohol consumption, and also by genetic factors, which contribute to the medical risk factors associated with ASCVD development including hypertension, diabetes, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). LDL-C is intimately involved in each step in the cascade to cardiovascular disease development: macrophage engorgement and foam cell formation, arterial wall injury, inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation, and reduced LDL-C concentrations are associated with protection from ASCVD [2]. In spite of the aggressive use of LDL-lowering medications such as statins, many patients cannot achieve the therapeutic LDL-C levels recommended by clinical guidelines and are thus at risk of developing ASCVD [3]. There is therefore a need for novel therapies to reduce plasma LDL-C and prevent the development of ASCVD and its sequela of myocardial infarction (MI).",

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which involve genotyping hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals phenotyped for lipid traits, have evolved as an unbiased tool to identify common variants that contribute in a causal manner to lipid variations in the population [5, 6, 7\u2022, 8\u2022]. Importantly, GWAS aims to identify many genes and loci of generally small effect size that contribute to population variations in a trait, instead of single gene defects that have dramatic effects on phenotype, like those seen in Mendelian disorders.\n",

GWAS have also identified genes that are drug targets for LDL-lowering therapies, including NPC1L1, the molecular target of ezetimibe, and HMGCR, the molecular target of statin drugs [8\u2022]. GWAS have also identified a number of novel genes and loci that contribute to population variability in LDL-C. The locus in the human genome with the strongest association to LDL-C is a novel 1p13 locus, which harbors the genes SORT1, PSRC1, and CELSR2. Importantly, the 1p13 locus is associated not only with the intermediate phenotype of LDL-C, but also with the hard clinical endpoint of cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the initial identification of the 1p13 locus as a genome-wide significant and important determinant of LDL-C levels and cardiovascular disease risk in the population, early mechanistic studies to determine how the 1p13 locus affects LDL-C and cardiovascular disease risk, and the current controversy surrounding the disparate mechanistic studies that have emerged.",

Importantly, this study demonstrated that homozygosity for the minor allele is associated with a 16 mg/dL lower systemic LDL-C as compared to homozygotes for the major allele, which is an unusually large effect size for a common variant. These results have been confirmed in other European and non-European populations [14, 15\u2022, 16]. All subfractions of LDL were reduced in individuals of the minor haplotype; however, the most dramatic reductions occurred in the small, dense LDL fractions, which are derived from the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich VLDL1 and thought to be the most atherogenic [17\u2022].",

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data suggest that homozygosity for the minor allele is associated with elevated expression of SORT1, PSRC1, and CELSR2 in human liver, with SORT1 and PSRC1 expression most strongly influenced by genotype with 10- to 12-fold elevations in expression with homozygosity for the minor allele.

Sortilin also localizes to the plasma membrane where it can act as a signalling receptor for pro-neurotrophins [21], function as an uptake receptor [22\u2022], or be cleaved by the metallopeptidase TNF alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) in a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner to generate a soluble fragment comprising the sortilin luminal domain [23]. It has recently been reported that sortilin is cleaved intracellularly and at the cell surface by the protease ADAM10 to generate the soluble luminal domain [24]. Sortilin binds to a number of ligands involved in lipid metabolism including lipoprotein lipase [25], apolipoprotein E [26], and apolipoprotein AV [27], which are involved in triglyceride metabolism. It is unclear, however, how these interactions might explain the strong association of the SORT1 locus with LDL-C.\n",

CELSR2 expression also increased with homozygosity for the minor allele; however, the magnitude of the expression change was far less robust. Importantly, homozygosity for the minor alleles at 1p13 did not lead to an expression change in SORT1, CELSR2, or PSRC1 in subcutaneous or omental fat, suggesting a liver specificity to the expression changes seen with the protective minor alleles [17\u2022].",

Through a series of deletion and mutagenesis constructs, Musunuru et al. [17\u2022] were able to identify the causal SNP that alone conferred the expression changes of the minor allele.

Compensatory mechanisms could be in place, which could explain the disparate phenotypes. Furthermore, whereas Kjolby et al.
