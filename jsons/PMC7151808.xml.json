It is a term used to describe the emergence of previously unrecognized pathogens that produce human disease or recognized pathogens expanding in different ways through the population.1 Emerging diseases have historically been responsible for civilization-altering events. Bubonic plague during the 14th century was responsible for the death of 60% of the European population.2 The Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 resulted in the death of 50 to 100 million worldwide; the rinderpest epidemic in livestock in Eastern Africa during the 19th century resulted in the starvation of 75% of the Massai population; and potato blight produced the Irish potato famine, reducing the Irish population by 25%.3 Our generation has had dramatic experiences in the last decade with emerging or reemerging pathogens that rapidly spread and result in death or illness in large segments of the population, to include many of the pathogens mentioned in this section and outlined in this book, such as Ebola and Zika viruses. For the clinician, the challenge is to distinguish a viral febrile illness caused by an endemic pathogen from one that is \u201cemerging\u201d and has the potential for human-to-human spread, requiring isolation and, if available, targeted therapy. The scenario is common: a patient presents to the emergency room, usually on a weekend, with fever and a constellation of symptoms and a recent history of travel overseas. The fear is this Ebola, Lassa fever, or another unknown contagious pathogen, and are the clinician and the staff at risk? In this section the epidemiology, clinical features, and evaluation of the patient with a potential viral febrile illness from an emerging pathogen are discussed.",

Table 36.1\nlists the reported outbreaks by year as reported by the World Health Organization.6 Conclusions that we can draw from this table are that the majority of the reported outbreaks of diseases in the world are caused by viruses, the majority of these viruses are RNA viruses, most have an animal reservoir in their life cycle, and the majority of outbreaks affect developing countries and potential \u201chot spots\u201d for emerging pathogens. Jones et al. analyzed 335 emerging infectious disease events between 1940 and 2004.7 Emerging disease events were found to have risen significantly over time, with the peak number of events occurring in the 1980s corresponding to the HIV pandemic. Emerging disease events were predominantly zoonotic (60.3%), originated from wildlife (71.8%), and are increasing over time. Factors that determine the emergence of these viruses include (1) high mutation rate and adaptation of the RNA viruses; (2) human intimacy (cross-species transmission) and movement of animal species due to land development and migration from political conflicts; (3) increase in urbanization; (4) climate change with increase and spread of potential insect vectors and changes in migratory patterns of birds; and (5) societal mobility through air travel.8\n",

            "text": "Emerging viral pathogens can, in general, present in one of the following clinical categories: (1) generalized febrile illness producing a \u201cviral syndrome,\u201d (2) fever with meningitis/encephalitis, (3) fever with joint pain, (4) hemorrhagic fever, and (5) birth defects. Due to human host and viral diversity, many viruses can produce illness across the spectrum of these clinical categories. For example, dengue virus as a first infection can result in a sub-clinical infection or a febrile illness that results in a self-limited fever, myalgia, bone pain, and transient laboratory abnormalities. On second infection, dengue virus in a minority of patients can produce a severe hemorrhagic disease. Chikungunya and Ross River viruses can produce a generalized febrile illness but also severe joint pains that can persist for months. Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and the equine encephalitis viruses are classic viruses that produce a meningo-encephalitis in 1% of the persons infected. Yellow fever and the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) are examples of severe hemorrhagic fever viruses. The recent Zika virus outbreak and birth defects associated with infection in pregnant women have broadened our clinical categories to include those that produce birth defects. All viruses produce a constellation of signs and symptoms early in infection that are clinically the same. After infection, an incubation period of normally between 1 and 14 days can occur, with some exceptions. For example, Ebola has been reported to occur 21 days after exposure.9 The first onset of symptoms heralds the host immune response with fever followed by generalized symptoms of headache, muscle aches, joint pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Early laboratory abnormalities that would indicate a viral infection include leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Electrolyte and renal function abnormalities can be common if the patient is volume depleted. As the disease progresses, clinical manifestations will be become more specific for the clinical syndrome and provide clues on the potential virus, such as the onset of headache, neck stiffness, and altered sensorium in the case of encephalitis; severe joint pains; or bleeding internally or externally with blood loss or hemoconcentration, with plasma leakage with the hemorrhagic fevers. Specific manifestations such as diuresis, volume loss, and renal dysfunction can be an indicator for viruses that produce hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome such as the Hantaviruses or Lassa fever. Rash is common to all the viral illnesses and in general indicates a shift in the host immune response from a cell-mediated to a humoral immune response with a rise in antibodies. It is important for the clinician to understand that viremia occurs several days before the onset of clinical illness and through the duration of early clinical symptoms. Pathogens that are spread by insect vectors, the respiratory route, blood-borne contact, or sexually can occur before the onset of clinical symptoms, and thus infect others who come in contact by that route. Contact tracing from the index patient should include the days of viremia before the onset of symptoms.",

            "text": "Understanding the incubation time of viral pathogens is the first important step in evaluating the febrile patient. A travel history in an area of an outbreak or potential hot spot for an emerging disease should be within the incubation period of these pathogens (1\u201321 days). For example, a febrile patient in your clinic or emergency room who had traveled overseas 3 months before fever would be unlikely to have a viral infection, and potential other etiologies such as non-falciparum malaria or a parasitic infection should be considered. An extensive travel history and exposures while traveling will help to determine the risk for the patient to acquire a local infection. An important question often not asked is \u201cwho else is sick in your travel party, and have you been in contact with anyone acutely ill?\u201d This can often be an important clue on the risk of acquiring an infection. If the patient is within the incubation period and at risk for a viral illness, determining the clinical illness day is important when obtaining the history. Our studies in hospitalized patients with dengue infection, for example, illustrate the importance for the clinician to approach the viral febrile illness and differential of potential viruses by determining the patient's clinical illness day and their clinical manifestation.10\nFig. 36.1\ndemonstrates an idealized patient with a viral febrile illness. In this example, after an incubation period of 3 days, the first day of viremia occurs. Viremia will continue, with the onset of fever heralding the first day of clinical illness. In general, the first 3 to 5 days of clinical illness of most viral infections will be a generalized febrile illness with no clinical signs or symptoms that will distinguish the illness to a specific viral pathogen, denoted here as a viral syndrome. Headache, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms will be common during the viral syndrome stage. Influenza, dengue, chikungunya, Ebola, or Lassa fever will all be indistinguishable from each other in the early clinical illness. By day 5 of the clinical illness day, day 9 post-infection, the manifestations will become more specific and hemorrhagic manifestations and coagulopathy will occur, along with plasma leakage and encephalitis. As the host response increases with antibody levels rising and cytokines peaking, the manifestations of a specific viral illness will become apparent as cellular damage occurs.",

Fig. 36.1 demonstrates the time-dependent diagnostic test that can be performed during the clinical course of the patient. In this example, viremia will start before fever and last until 6 days of clinical illness and before the onset of viral-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. During viremia, diagnostic tests should be focused on detecting the virus, whether by viral isolation, molecular techniques, or antigen detection. Viremia starts to resolve with the onset of the host response and corresponding rise in viral-specific IgM and IgG. Antibodies will continue to rise during the convalescent period, and IgG will last several years or more. Once antibodies start to rise, the diagnostics are focused on their detection, with a variety of methods that can be used, including enzyme-linked immunoassays, hemagglutination inhibition, plaque reduction neutralization, and rapid tests.",

The shift in the dominant circulating DENV serotype often leads to waves of large-scale epidemic dengue activity.4 Historically, the Americas were characterized by isolated and interspersed dengue outbreaks of a single infecting serotype. Over the past several decades, Asian genotype DENV strains have spread throughout the Americas accompanied by increased co-circulation of multiple DENV serotypes.5 As such, the dengue disease and transmission patterns in the Americas are shifting toward the Asian hyper-endemic patterns. The global burden of symptomatic dengue is on the order of 100 million cases/year.6\n",

Viremia can also be detected by antigen-detection assays that measure circulating levels of a DENV non-structural protein, NS1. The timeline for detectable circulating soluble NS1 lags viral RNA RT-PCR detection by 1 to 2 days. The most widely used serologic assay for dengue is IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A single positive dengue IgM or high-titer IgG can only provide a presumptive diagnosis of dengue. Definitive serologic diagnosis requires paired acute and convalescent sera. Anti-DENV IgM antibody levels do not generally become positive until the fifth or sixth day of illness and can be affected by other flavivirus infections (e.g., Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus).

Effective repellants should contain N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), 3-(N-acetyl-N-butyl)-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester (IR3535), or 1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester (icaridin).18 At the public health level, a sustained and integrated vector-control strategy is generally needed to consistently reduce A. aegypti population densities. A. aegypti mosquitoes proliferate in many peri-domestic water-containing habitats. These include purposely filled man-made containers (e.g., water storage barrels, flowerpots/vases), rain-filled objects (e.g., used tires), and natural habitats (e.g., tree holes).",

Given the potential for increased disease severity upon sequential infection with heterologous DENV serotypes, a general consensus has been that effective vaccination strategies will require simultaneous immunization to the four DENV serotypes (tetravalent vaccines). A chimeric live-attenuated viral vaccine, where the DENVs 1 to 4 envelope proteins have been engineered onto a yellow fever (YF)\u201317D vaccine backbone, is licensed in several countries. However, if this vaccine is administered to truly dengue-na\u00efve individuals, it appears to be able to enhance the subsequent disease severity with a natural DENV infection. Another tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine (attenuated by a deletion in the DENV2 3\u2019 untranslated region [UTR]) is in phase III clinical trials. Other dengue vaccine products that are in pre-clinical or early clinical phases include an adjuvanted recombinant envelope protein vaccine, an adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccine, and a plasmid DNA vaccine. The combination of effective dengue vaccination with vector-control strategies will open up the possibility of severely halting, or even eradicating, DENV transmission in many endemic regions.",

The symptoms of Zika resemble those of dengue and chikungunya virus infections, and Zika testing has limitations in terms of availability, sensitivity, and specificity. Sexual transmission is of concern, with potentially prolonged viral shedding in semen. Transfusion-related transmission has also occurred. Prevention of Zika virus infection rests on avoidance of vector mosquitoes and sexual contact with infected persons, especially important during pregnancy to reduce the occurrence of congenital infection.",

In 2007 Zika virus caused a large outbreak on Yap Island (western Pacific), initially thought to be caused by dengue virus; the virus was estimated to infect 70% of the population.1 It subsequently caused a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 to 2014.2 Zika virus was first associated with recognized outbreaks in Brazil in 2015, but recent analyses using sequencing, molecular mapping, and modeling suggest Zika reached the Americas as early as 2013, with cryptic transmission before the disease was detected.3, 4, 5 From northeast Brazil the virus spread to the Caribbean, Central America, and throughout South America (except Chile and Uruguay where local vector transmission has not been documented); many countries in Asia and Africa have also documented transmission6 (Fig. 36.3.1\n). Local vector transmission in the continental United States has occurred in Florida and Texas (226 cases as of December 2017; https://www.cdc.gov/zika).

OROV has four recognized genotypes (I, II, III, and IV) causing the same disease, which is characterized by acute febrile onset accompanied by headache, photophobia, muscle and joint pains, and in limited cases, meningitis. OROV is widely distributed in northern South America and is transmitted in urban settings by the midge Culicoides paraensis. The diagnosis is performed by virus isolation into cell culture or mice of suspected blood of acute-phase patients, by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR, and by serologically through detection of specific IgM antibodies. Conventional serologic tests can also give a positive result, but need two serum samples (acute and convalescent phases) with an interval of at least 1 week. There are no specific drugs for treatment of Oropouche fever patients, but fever, headache, and muscle/joint pains are often treated with common analgesics such as aspirin and acetaminophen. No vaccine against OROV is available, and only personal protection measures can avoid the anthropophilic vector bites.",

The original isolation of Mayaro virus occurred in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954 from the blood of febrile patients. Two major epidemics were described in the Brazilian Amazon region2; smaller epidemics have been recognized since then in other parts of Brazil and in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.3, 4 Mayaro virus is maintained in nature in a cycle involving mammals, birds, and hematophagous arthropods. New World non-human primates and marmosets have been implicated as natural hosts.5 The virus has been isolated several times from Haemagogus spp. mosquitoes, mainly from H. janthinomys species, which is considered the primary potential vector. There are three distinct genotypes of the virus. In addition, a unique strain of Mayaro virus has been recovered from Coquillettidia venezuelensis in Trinidad, two others from Sabethes spp., and one from Culex spp., which can represent spillover of the virus from the hosts.",

An aspect to consider is the possibility of co-circulation of MAYV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a same area, because both viruses are members of the Semliki Forest group in the Alphavirus genus, and a high cross-reactivity is present in serologic tests even on IgM-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).

For virus isolation, biologic samples (serum or blood) obtained from viremic patients (up to 5 days after the onset of the symptoms) are used for inoculation in newborn mice or in Vero cells. Suspensions prepared from brains of mice or supernatants of infected cells are used as antigens in either complement fixation tests or an immunofluorescence assay against hyperimmune sera of different arboviruses circulating in the region.

Retrospective studies have subsequently documented SFTS cases in Japan in 2005, rural areas of central China in spring 2006, and South Korea in 2010.3, 4, 5 Transmission occurs through tick vectors, mainly Haemaphysalis longicornis, with animals such as goats, cattle, sheep, yak, donkeys, pigs, cats, deer, rats, mice, hedgehogs, weasels, brushtail possums, chickens, and some birds thought to serve as animal reservoirs. Migratory birds can act as carriers for H. longicornis\u2013borne SFTSV and may be important in long-distance dissemination.3, 6 SFTS occurs mainly during the spring and summer months when tick density is highest in endemic areas and human contact with infected ticks from animals is most likely. High-risk groups include farmers, ranchers, forest workers, and others who live in rural, hilly, wooded areas. Person-to-person transmission through direct contact with blood or bloody secretions has been reported.7, 8 SFTSV is phylogenetically separated into two clades, Chinese and Japanese, with viruses usually (though not always) consistent with their geographic origin.

Viremia peaks during the febrile illness stage at about 7 to 10 days after fever onset, and high viremia may be associated with poor outcomes.10, 11 Very high viremia can occur, accompanied by uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. During the multi-organ involvement stage, viremia gradually falls in survivors, but remains high in fatal cases. Viral components have been detected in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.12 The marked thrombocytopenia typical of SFTS has been proposed to be due to splenic macrophage clearance of circulating virus-bound platelets.13\n",

Multi-organ involvement can occur about 5 days after illness onset, lasting for 7 to 14 days, with progressive failure in fatal cases or a self-limited course in survivors. Progressive organ failure can be rapid, first in the liver and heart, then the lungs and kidneys. About one fifth of patients can have central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, including apathy, seizures, muscle tremors, and/or coma. Death can occur in 12% to 30% of cases, with the average time between illness onset and death being 9 days.12, 14 Poor outcomes are more likely in patients with advanced age, decreased consciousness, underlying disease, bleeding tendencies, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase, prolonged activated partial prothrombin times, and elevated C-reactive protein during the disease course.15, 16, 17 The convalescence period in survivors begins about 11 to 19 days after illness onset.",

During the 1980s a disease characterized by rash and arthritis was described in Sweden, Russia, and Finland and named Ockelbo disease, Karelian fever, and Pogosta disease, respectively.
