            "text": "The serine and threonine protein kinase PKR was originally identified as an innate antiviral protein induced following type-1 IFN signaling (Meurs et al., 1990). Antiviral activity is mediated through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, leading to inhibition of translation (Garcia et al., 2006, Sadler and Williams, 2007) and induction of apoptosis (Lee et al., 1997). Double stranded (ds) RNA, a common intermediate during viral replication, constitutes a primary signal inducing PKR dimerization and autophosphorylation, thereby converting latent PKR into the activated form (Taylor et al., 1996, Wu and Kaufman, 1997). However, PKR can also be activated by a variety of other stimuli, including stress, cytokines, RNA structures, bacterial infection, DNA damage, and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) following cell injury and necrosis (Garcia et al., 2006, Sadler and Williams, 2007). Depending on the activating insult and cell type, activated PKR can also interact directly with inflammasome components to promote release of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein (Lu et al., 2012). Activated PKR also promotes induction of pro-inflammatory genes via NF-kB activation (Kumar et al., 1994), and can enhance IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression via both IRF3 activation (Zhang and Samuel, 2008) and maintaining IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA integrity (Schulz et al., 2010). In addition, PKR activation by poly I:C, LPS and various infections such as mycobacterium and Sendai virus induce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in monocyte/macrophages (Cheung et al., 2005, Chakrabarti et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Most studies analyzing PKR function during viral infections in vitro and in vivo have focused on its antiviral activity. How PKR regulates inflammation during infection, especially viral encephalitis is less well characterized. PKR plays a crucial role in antiviral defense following vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection by directly diminishing virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Uncontrolled CNS VSV replication results in 100% mortality in PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice (Stojdl et al., 2000). Increased peripheral virus replication was also associated with increased mortality of West Nile virus (WNV) infected dual RNaseL/PKR\u2212/\u2212 compared to single RNaseL\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, virus dissemination to the CNS was not enhanced (Samuel et al., 2006), suggesting PKR did not contribute to antiviral activity within the CNS. Poliovirus infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice also showed no difference in CNS virus replication, but were protected from extensive spinal cord damage (Scheuner et al., 2003). While the effect of PKR on neurotropic coronaviruses has not been assessed, PKR modestly reduced replication of the hepato- and neuro-tropic coronavirus MHV-A59 in macrophage cultures (Zhao et al., 2012). These varying outcomes suggest that PKR activation and functions in vivo differ between infections and host cell types, thus regulating inflammatory responses and pathogenesis independent of antiviral activity.",

            "text": "Based on the limited knowledge of PKR mediated regulation of innate and adaptive responses during viral CNS infection, the present study sets out to characterize in vivo effects of PKR on immune modulation following infection with the sublethal, demyelinating gliatropic coronavirus JHMV. JHMV infection is initiated in the brain and spreads to the spinal cord, where it preferentially persists in oligodendrocytes (Fleming et al., 1986, Kapil et al., 2012). In wt mice infectious virus peaks between days 3\u20135 post infection (p.i.) and is reduced by T cells between days 7 and 14 p.i. to undetectable levels. Persistence is characterized by sustained viral RNA in the absence of infectious virus (Bergmann et al., 2006). Results herein show that Pkr mRNA is upregulated coincident with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2\uf020following JHMV infection and is sustained throughout T cell mediated viral control. Activated PKR was not only expressed in infected cells, but also in neighboring, uninfected cells. Nevertheless, the absence of PKR only modestly elevated virus early during infection, consistent with effective antiviral T cell control. Furthermore, PKR deficiency did not affect CNS IL-1\u03b2, CCL5 and CXCL10 expression, despite significantly reduced levels of the respective mRNAs. Moreover, these studies are the first to reveal a positive regulatory effect of PKR on TIMP-1, IL-21 and IL-10 expression, all prominently associated with CD4 T cells during JHMV encephalomyelitis. Overall the results highlight the potential for immune modulation by PKR in both CNS resident as well as infiltrating cells. Although these immune modulatory effects were insufficient to grossly influence JHMV pathogenesis, the results demonstrate PKR as a selective regulator of key cytokines and chemokines controlling neuroinflammation.",

All mice were housed under pathogen free conditions in accredited facility at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (PHS assurance number: A3047-01). Infections in vivo were carried out with the sublethal, gliatropic, monoclonal antibody (mAb) derived variant of JHMV, designated 2.2v-1 (Fleming et al., 1986). In vitro infections of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were carried out with the MHV-A59 strain, kindly provided by Dr. Volker Thiel (Kantonal Hospital, St. Gallen, Switzerland). Mice at 6\u20137 weeks of age were infected intracranially in the left hemisphere with 1000 plaque forming units (PFU) of JHMV diluted in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a final volume of 30 \u03bcl. Clinical disease severity was graded daily using the following scale: 0, healthy; 1, ruffled fur/hunched back; 2, inability to turn upright/partial hind limb paralysis; 3, complete hind limb paralysis; and 4, moribund or dead. Virus replication in cell free supernatants from the brain was determined by plaque assay on DBT astrocytoma cell monolayers as described. Briefly, individual brains or spinal cords were homogenized in 4 ml Dulbecco's PBS using chilled Tenbroeck glass homogenizers.

            "text": "IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 dependent responses are vital to limit early JHMV spread throughout the CNS, stem neuronal infection, and prevent mortality (Ireland et al., 2008). Furthermore, the kinetics, diversity and magnitude of gene expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulated genes (ISGs) are regulated in a cell type specific manner during JHMV infection in vivo (Kapil et al., 2012). However, the antiviral and regulatory roles of ISGs within the CNS remain poorly characterized (Ireland et al., 2008, Ireland et al., 2009, Rose et al., 2010). Due to the diverse PKR functions in regulating antiviral activity and inflammation, we initially assessed the expression kinetics of Pkr relative to Ifn-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA in the brains of wt mice following JHMV infection (Fig. 1\n). Ifn-\u03b2 and Ifn-\u03b14 mRNA, barely detectable in na\u00efve mice, were modestly upregulated by days 3 and 5 p.i. and already reduced by day 7 p.i. Pkr mRNA, abundant in na\u00efve brains, was further increased by ~ 3 and ~ 10 fold at days 3 and 5 p.i., respectively, consistent with early Ifn-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression However, unlike the decline of Ifn-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNAs after day 5 p.i., Pkr mRNA only decreased after day 7 p.i. While microglia/macrophages are the early targets of infection, virus replicates prominently in oligodendrocytes by day 7 p.i. However, Ifn-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA is only induced in microglia/macrophages and not in oligodendrocytes (Kapil et al., 2012). Transcripts were thus also monitored in CNS derived cell populations preferentially infected by JHMV to assess cell type specific Pkr mRNA regulation in vivo (Fig. 1). Basal Pkr mRNA was higher in microglia compared to that in oligodendrocytes, consistent with various other ISGs (Kapil et al., 2012). In infected mice Pkr mRNA levels rose by 3-fold in microglia at day 3 p.i. but declined thereafter. Similarly, Pkr mRNA was high in CNS infiltrating monocytes, but subsided after day 5 p.i. By contrast, infection induced a ~ 11\u201318 fold increase in Pkr mRNA in oligodendrocytes by days 3 and 5 p.i., which further rose to 30-fold above basal values by day 7 p.i., at which time T cell effector function and IFN-\u03b3 production peaks (Bergmann et al., 2006). These data revealed that microglia/macrophages as well as oligodendrocytes contribute to overall elevated Pkr mRNA throughout acute infection, but that maximal expression in oligodendrocytes coincides with peak adaptive rather than innate immune responses.",

To determine if PKR activation is restricted to infected cells, expression of phosphorylated PKR (PKR-p) and viral antigen were assessed by immune fluorescence (Fig. 2\n). PKR-p was abundant in infected brains at both days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 2), but undetectable in na\u00efve brains (data not shown). Quantification revealed that > 50% of cells expressed PKR-p, while it remained undetectable in infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice at matched time points (data not shown). Furthermore, the vast majority of virus infected cells exhibited PKR activation at day 5 p.i., but not at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2), when T cells start controlling virus replication (Bergmann et al., 2006). PKR-p was also detected in a large population of uninfected cells localized not only proximal, but also distal to foci of virus infection at both 5 and 7 days p.i. (Fig. 2); however we cannot exclude the possibility of proximal infected cells below detection or outside the focus field. Overall, these results suggest that non-virus associated signals, such as stress, pro-inflammatory factors, or death associated molecular stimuli contribute to PKR activation during acute viral encephalitis.",

PKR deficiency did not alter the kinetics or expression of Ifn-\u03b2, Ifn-\u03b14 and Ifn-\u03b15 mRNA in the brains of infected mice (Fig. 4\n). Ifn-\u03b2 mRNA was induced to similar levels at days 3 and 5 p.i. and did not decline until day 7 p.i., while Ifn-\u03b14 and Ifn-\u03b15 mRNAs peaked at day 3 p.i. and declined by day 5 p.i. in both groups. Induction of the ISGs Ifit1 and Ifit2, which are highly sensitive to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during JHMV infection (Ireland et al., 2008), was used as a readout for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, as coronaviruses only induce barely detectable levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 within the CNS (Butchi et al., 2014). No differences in ifit1 or ifit2 mRNA levels supported similar IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activity in both groups (Fig. 4).

However, to our knowledge this has not been investigated extensively in vivo. Several proinflammatory factors were therefore monitored at the transcriptional level to reveal potential impairment in the absence of PKR. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, commonly upregulated following neuroinflammation, both promote disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and recruitment of lymphocytes (Hopkins and Rothwell, 1995, Erta et al., 2012). CCL2 is essential for monocyte recruitment (Savarin et al., 2010), while CXCL10 and CCL5 attract T cells to the CNS (Glass et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2001a). Il-1\u03b2, Il-6, Ccl2, and Ccl5 mRNAs were all induced to comparable levels in the brains of infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 relative to wt mice at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 5A). After day 3 p.i. Ccl2, Il-6, and Il-1\u03b2 mRNA declined progressively, with Il-6 mRNA dropping to 50% of wt levels in PKR\u2212/\u2212 brains at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 5A). Ccl5 mRNA in PKR\u2212/\u2212 brains was sustained throughout days 3\u201310 p.i., contrasting the significant increase in wt mice at days 7 and 10 p.i. (Fig. 5A). The selective increase in Ccl5 mRNA in the CNS of infected wt mice at day 7 p.i. suggested expression by a newly infiltrating population, possibly T cells (Glass and Lane, 2003), which may be dysregulated in the absence of PKR. Cxcl10 mRNA was not induced until day 5 p.i. in either group, but was significantly reduced in the absence of PKR, reaching only ~ 30% of the levels in wt mice at both days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 5A). These data support PKR-p as a positive regulator of only a subset of genes regulated by NF-kB.",

IL-1\u03b2 remained similarly high in both groups at day 7 p.i. and only declined at day 10 p.i. Similar CCL5 levels in both groups also reflected equal mRNA levels at day 5 p.i. By day 7 p.i. the ~ 3-fold increase in CCL5 in wt mice also coincided with elevated mRNA. Unexpectedly however, CCL5 in PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice reached similar levels observed in wt mice at days 7 and 10 p.i., despite the absence of enhanced transcriptional activation after day 5 p.i.

While infected wt BMDM strongly upregulated both Ccl5 and Cxcl10 mRNA between 12 and 18 h p.i., induction of both mRNAs was significantly reduced in PKR\u2212/\u2212 BMDM (Suppl. Fig. 2). By contrast, Ccl2 mRNA levels were not affected by PKR deficiency (Suppl. Fig. 2). Furthermore, infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 BMDM secreted increased CCL5 and similar CXCL10 compared to wt BMDM (Suppl. Fig. 2). Expression patterns of mRNAs and proteins thus mirrored the in vivo findings.",

Effective virus control, despite elevated replication during the early phase of JHMV infection, supported the concept that PKR deficiency may enhance T cell recruitment or antiviral function. The magnitude and composition of CNS infiltrating cells were thus compared between infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice by flow cytometry (Suppl. Fig. 3). Total CD45hi infiltrating cells and the magnitude of CD45hi F4/80+ infiltrating monocytes were similar in both groups (Suppl. Fig. 3). CD4 and CD8 T cells both accumulated in the CNS to maximal levels between days 7\u201310 p.i. and accounted for ~ 60% of total CD45hi infiltrates in both groups. Furthermore, CD8 T cells were consistently higher at day 7 p.i. and CD4 T cells at both days 7 and 10 p.i. within the brains of PKR\u2212/\u2212 relative to wt mice (Suppl. Fig. 3). No differences or less than 2-fold higher numbers of monocytes and T cells, respectively, supported the absence of defects in chemokine mediated leukocyte recruitment in the absence of PKR.",

            "text": "PKR has been implicated in regulating CD8 T cell antiviral function and IL-10 production in monocytes (Cheung et al., 2005, Nakayama et al., 2010). During acute JHMV encephalomyelitis, perforin mediated cytolysis and IFN-\u03b3 produced by T cells are essential antiviral mediators (Bergmann et al., 2006). PKR deficiency enhanced IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and protein early, but did not affect IFN-\u03b3 during peak T cell accumulation in the CNS (Fig. 6\n). To rule out a reduction in other T cell functions in the absence of PKR, we further assessed expression of IL-10. During JHMV infection IL-10 in the CNS is predominantly produced by CD4 T cells (Trandem et al., 2011) and is critical to minimize demyelination. IL-10 is also produced by a small fraction of CD8 T cells with high cytolytic capacity, yet it inhibits clearance of infectious virus (Trandem et al., 2011). Il-10 mRNA was prominently increased at day 7 in wt mice, but was reduced by 6\u20137 fold in PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6). Moreover, IL-10 protein levels were also significantly impaired (Fig. 6). The kinetics and breadth of IL-10 reduction, despite unimpaired T cell infiltration suggest a CD4 T cell specific functional defect. CNS CD4 T cells are also the main producers of IL-21 and TIMP1, but do not express IL-17 during JHMV infection (Zhou et al., 2005, Kapil et al., 2009, Phares et al., 2012b). While IL-21 enhances humoral responses during JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2013a), TIMP1 deficiency impairs migration of CD4 T cells from the perivascular space to the brain parenchyma (Savarin et al., 2013). Reduced Il-21 and Timp1 transcripts in the CNS of PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice supported selectively impaired CD4 T cell function (Fig. 6). Furthermore, reduced IL-21 protein expression was supported by reduced levels of IgG mRNA at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 6), when IL-21 dependent antibody secreting cells start accumulating in the CNS (Phares et al., 2013a). Moreover, TIMP1 levels were also significantly reduced (Fig. 6), suggesting that impaired IL-10, IL-21 and TIMP1 transcription was not overcome by enhanced translation.",

Ifit2 mediates innate antiviral activity against MHV-A59 via promoting IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Butchi et al., 2014). The present study investigated PKR as a candidate contributing to protection based on its ability to not only block translation, but also promote IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and pro-inflammatory mediators (Garcia et al., 2006). Following JHMV infection PKR was activated in the majority of CNS infected cells at 5 day p.i., supporting virus mediated activation. However, PKR-p detection in neighboring uninfected cells suggested that stimuli other than viral RNA also activate PKR. Higher CNS virus replication early during JHMV infection in PKR\u2212/\u2212 relative to wt mice, in the absence of overt defects in Ifn-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA or ISGs induction, supported PKR mediated antiviral activity in vivo. However, the effects were modest and increased replication was ultimately controlled by adaptive immunity.",

            "text": "PKR can influence inflammatory responses by promoting NF-kB transcriptional activation in a variety of settings in vitro, including poly I:C activation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Garcia et al., 2006). However, poly I:C-induced NF-kB activation in mouse peritoneal macrophages does not require PKR (Maggi et al., 2000), suggesting that the function of PKR in promoting NF-kB transcriptional activation depends on the activating stimulus and cell type. MHV induces IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 via the intracellular recognition receptor MDA5 in macrophages (Roth-Cross et al., 2008) and both MDA5 and RIGI in an oligodendrocyte cell line (Li et al., 2010). Although the pathway underlying induction of NF-kB dependent chemokines and cytokines has not been studied extensively, abrogation of RIGI partially blocked NF-kB activity following MHV-A59 infection (Li et al., 2010). This finding supported a potential link between viral mediated MDA5 activation and NF-kB transcriptional activation. Reduced expression of Il-6, Ccl5 and Cxcl10 but not Il-1\u03b2, and Ccl2 mRNAs in vivo in the absence of PKR during JHMV infection is thus consistent with PKR mediated promotion of NF-kB activation. Although the cell types involved remain to be identified, MHV-A59 infected BMDM exhibited similar selective defects in proinflammatory gene induction. TMEV infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes also showed limited activation of NF-kB dependent transcription, but also impaired IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression (Palma et al., 2003, Carpentier et al., 2007). By contrast, no differences were evident in Ifn-\u03b1/\u03b2, Ifit1 or Ifit2 mRNA following MHV infection of PKR\u2212/\u2212 BMDM (data not shown). IL-6, CXCL10 and CCL5 are all implicated in promoting leukocyte infiltration into the CNS parenchyma. Specifically CXCL10 and CCL5 facilitate CD4 T cell recruitment to the CNS during JHMV infection (Liu et al., 2001, Glass and Lane, 2003). Reduced mRNA levels of these proinflammatory factors were thus inconsistent with the increase in CNS infiltrating T cells in PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice. This discrepancy was resolved by the demonstration of similar or even increased CCL5, CXCL10 and IL-1\u03b2 protein in the brains. The notion that impaired transcription of select genes was balanced by increased translation was supported by MHV infected BMDM from wt and PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, astrocytes, which are not or rarely infected by JHMV (Ireland et al., 2009), not microglia/macrophages, are the predominant source of CXCL10 following MHV infection (Lane et al., 1998, Phares et al., 2013b). These results indicate that PKR dependent regulation of CXCL10 expression is not dependent on infection and not necessarily cell type specific. Although CD4 T cells are implicated as a dominant source of CCL5 based on reduced CCL5 mRNA levels in CD4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Lane et al., 2000), CD4 T cells may also indirectly affect CCL5 production by other cellular sources (Lane et al., 2000).",

Consistent with CD4 T cells as the main producers of IL-10 in our model (Puntambekar et al., 2011), the frequency of CNS derived virus specific PKR\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells capable of IL-10 production was reduced by ~ 50% compared to that of wt CD4 T cells. By contrast, PKR\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells showed no evidence for reduced IL-10 production, and IFN-\u03b3 production was not impaired in either T cell subset, consistent with effective viral control. Decreased Il-21 mRNA and TIMP1, also mainly produced by CD4 T cells (Zhou et al., 2005, Phares et al., 2012b), support the concept that PKR primarily affects CD4 T cell function. In this context it is interesting to note that Il-10 expression is regulated by various transcription factors, including NF-kB, Jnk, cMaf, AP1, and IRF4, while Il-21 transcription in CD4 T cells is linked to cMaf activation (Hiramatsu et al., 2010), suggesting a possible in vivo link between PKR and cMaf activation. While our results specifically demonstrate an effect on virus specific CD4 T cells, it is not clear if PKR also affects IL-10 production by other CD4 regulatory T cell subsets. Irrespectively, detection of activated PKR-p in CD4 T cells, consistent with PKR activation in CNS infiltrating CD3 T cells during EAE (Chakrabarty et al., 2004), supports a direct effect.",

As CD4 T cells are not infected, the mechanisms inducing IL-10 in macrophages and CD4 T cells are clearly distinct, but suggest that activated PKR-p acts on a common intermediate signaling factor, such as NF-kB. The upstream signals activating PKR remain to be identified, but may involve a variety of factors, including stress inducing molecules (Sadler and Williams, 2007). Similarly, the promotion of CXCL10 mRNA expression in astrocytes, independent of direct infection, suggests that intrinsic cellular not virus mediated signals regulates PKR activation. While no evidence for dysregulation of CD8 T cells contrasted the apparent PKR effects on CD8 T cell expansion following LCMV infection (Nakayama et al., 2010), the effects of PKR deficiency in the latter studies appeared to be indirectly mediated by innate defects in antigen presenting cells rather than intrinsic CD8 T cell effects (Nakayama et al., 2010).",
