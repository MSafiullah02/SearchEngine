The following chapters were influenced by theoretical reflections, my life experience and my scientific training on three continents, at the universities of Antananarivo (Madagascar), Paris (France), Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland) and in Mexico (CISINAH, UAM and UNAM). The influence of these three cultures with very different historical backgrounds explains my progressively broadened understanding of the global development process. The post-colonial experiences in Africa in the 1960s, the violence left behind by the former colonial powers, and the outcome of civil wars, corruption and destruction of irreplaceable ecosystems and species forced me to understand not only the physical functioning of the human body (medicine), but also its psychological behaviour that supports or obstructs a healthy human life (psychology) and avoids environmental destruction (ecology). My understanding of the links between the human body, the mind and the environment (anthropology) resulted first in an intuitive and later an interdisciplinary approach to these four interrelated circles (body, mind, environment and human relations). Understanding the importance of these four study subjects triggered in me a commitment to responsible scientific and sustainable behaviour towards other human beings, but also to nature.",

Part I focuses on Peace and Security with a nonviolent approach to conflict resolution and human development. Most conflicts are related to the extraction of natural resources, therefore environmental security plays a crucial role in managing potential future conflicts. Globalisation has changed the relationship between humankind and nature, and environmental management is dominated by short-term profits, regardless of the costs of ecosystem destruction or pollution of water, soil and air. However, there are different environmental behaviours among men and women, but also among peasants and indigenous and multinational managers.",

Peace theories were basically developed by men and began with the 'negative peace' after World War II. However, none of these theories explored the root causes of violence, which are based on patriarchal relationships developed during the last several thousand years by religion, kingdoms, slavery, conquest and private enterprises. Thus, the next chapter (Chap. 12) proposes an engendered-sustainable peace from a feminist and bottom-up perspective that challenges the androgenic understanding of peace theories. Without doubt, climate change has brought new risks and threats to humankind, where a gender perspective may help to transform the traditional national and state security approach towards a more human-orientated perspective (Chap. 13).",

Part IV first reviews the outcome of the mismanagement of the previously analysed sectorial securities, where one of the most difficult outcomes are survival threats. Often people affected by disasters, especially long-time droughts, are deprived of their basic needs, which obliges them to migrate. Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean are the regions most affected by climate change, due to the fact that these countries are located between two oceans with rising temperatures. They are especially strongly exposed to hurricanes, droughts, landslides, sea level rise, coastal erosion and intrusion of sea water into the coastal aquifers and fertile coasts. Chapters 18 and 19 analyse first international migration and later internal migration with a gender perspective. Chapter 20 examines the nexus among water, soil, food, biodiversity and energy security, where the traditional military and political security approach is unable to propose sustainable alternatives for the future. Finally, Chap. 21 scrutinises ways in which the Global South could achieve a sustainable transition with equity and inclusive development processes, even when it is severely affected by climate and global environmental change.",

As a key concept, which gave birth to the Constitution on the United Nations Organisation after World War II, peace and security continue to be debated after the end of the Cold War. Because the world is a complex mosaic of different regional and socio-cultural interests, which have produced different conflicts, the mechanisms of conflict resolution are equally diverse and often adapted to the regional socio-economic and environmental conditions. Globally, some common desires for peace and security have historically evolved, but others have been subsumed under the expansion of global capitalism, where market forces and speculative capital have taken precedence over the productive and trade activities. In response to this, the Copenhagen School of Rethinking Security (Buzan et al. 1998 ) has introduced a new approach to analysing peace and security (1.4).",

The end of the Cold War and the expansion of a single economic system under neoliberalism have also influenced the peace community. Peace and security approaches have widened and now include in their analysis societal, economic and environmental themes (1.4.2). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP 1994) launched the 'human security' concept, and in 2007 Oswald Spring added gender security (1.4.3). Different multilateral organisations of the UN focusing on development issues introduced several sectorial approaches of security (Brauch et al. 2009 ). In the face of famine, FAO (1983) explored the concept of 'food security'. After several oil crises and price hikes during the 1970s, the newly established International Energy Agency (IEA 1994) introduced the concept of 'energy security'. In The Hague in 2000 the third World Water Forum proposed a ministerial understanding of 'water security', and in 2007 the WHO emphasised the need for public 'health security'. These specific security concepts were interpreted as being part of a sectorial approach. Finally, the World Economic Forum (2011) linked together water, food and energy security with a nexus approach, but without defining the conceptual reach of security .",

Their abundant natural resources (oil, gas, minerals, wood, etc.) made them attractive to multinational enterprises, which often polluted soils, air and water and exploited the resources at the cost of destroying ecosystem services, changing landscapes and making many local people poorer and poorer. Further, the massive use of fossil oil in the industrialised countries produced negative impacts of climate change and strong disasters in many developing countries (IPCC 2012 (IPCC , 2014a .

Since 1975, when the First UN Conference on Women occurred in Mexico, I have been actively involved with female peasants, marginalised urban people and academic experts to collectively think about these structural mechanisms of discrimination and exploitation related to patriarchy. As a new reconceptualisation of security (Oswald Spring/Brauch 2009), I introduce the gender perspective and explore the peace potential of different security approaches, where the understanding of the root causes of violence might offer an alternative way to deal with violence, destruction, exploitation and subordination. Thus, equality, equity and sustainability combined with peaceful negotiation and win-win outcomes for all involved, including the environment, might offer a pathway out of the devastation of human relations and nature.",

I believe that security should be embedded in a deepened and widened security approach (Buzan et al. 1998 ) to overcome the present environmental, economic, societal, gender and human destruction. This Human, Gender and Environmental Security (HUGE) security concept (Chap. 11), explores an integrated view that links up exploitation, violence, inequality and discrimination against women, indigenous people, children and other powerless humans with similar mechanisms that are used to exploit and destroy nature. I have been influenced by ecofeminism (Mies 1968; Warren 1997) that not only analysed, from a cross-cultural, interdisciplinary and anticolonial perspective the destruction of humankind and nature, but also proposed alternatives to overcome this destructive behaviour.",

Multinational enterprises (Monsanto merged with Bayer) had established a monopoly on agrochemicals and GM-seeds, and worldwide governments and international organisations (FAO, WB) supported this type of industrial agriculture. The result of this unnatural production has been biodiversity loss, soil depletion, erosion and food crisis in several developing countries, especially in the drylands in Africa. Therefore, from a bottom-up perspective, in collaboration with several ecofeminists I experimented with an organic agricultural subsistence approach 1 as an alternative to produce safe food for poor people despite the dominant patriarchal and capitalist system (Chap. 15). This subsistence approach was further developed by Via Campesina (2002) a world association of peasant organisationswith its concept of food sovereignty (Oswald Spring 2009), which we also are promoting in the Peasant University of the South (Universidad Campesina del Sur). Via Campesina (1996 Campesina ( , 2016 also promoted the interchange of native seeds among peasants from all over the world to avoid the spread of genetically modified organisms and the payment of seed patents (Oswald Spring 2011b). Recently, due to the drastic loss of natural soil fertility, desertification, erosion of soils, greater threats of climate change, especially in the drylands, and the persistence of hunger in developing countries, FAO (2013 FAO ( , 2016 has promoted these organic practices under the concept of climate-smart agriculture.",

This organic agriculture also represents a non-violent way to restore the damaged environment and improve food sovereignty in regions and nations with severe food scarcity, bad nutritious habits (obesity) and difficult climate conditions (Chap. 16).

However, the male mainstream of peace research has mostly ignored their conceptualisations. Inspired by these two exceptional women and after several years of research, I discussed the concept of sustainable peace and environmental security (Chap. 8). Later an engenderedsustainable peace concept emerged (Chap. 12). All these concepts not only focus on theoretical reflections, but should also serve as a tool for women and men from bottom up to strengthen their struggle for a more equal, peaceful and sustainable world without violence and peaceful conflict resolution or ahimsa (Chap. 4). The concept of an engendered-sustainable peace attempts to reach an understanding of violent patriarchal behaviour, and also explores alternatives in indigenous societies which have found ways to consolidate preventive conflict resolution (Mench\u00fa 2004) , avoid violence and peacefully reintegrate criminals into their society (Rojas Flores 2004) . Without a differentnonviolent and engenderedapproach to humans and nature, there is no possibility of saving the planet and its people. An alternative peace concept must be holistic and address physical, social, gender and cultural threats of the dominant values and behaviour in the Anthropocene (Oswald Chapters 10, 12, 13) . Climate change has also increased the pressure on the Global South and threatened not only traditional state security, but also the human, gender and environmental security (Chap. 11).",

Both processes have destroyed not only the livelihood of most local inhabitants, but also one of the most biodiverse regions on earth.

This securitisation process provided an arena for promoting mitigation measures that are needed globally to reduce GHG emissions. Further, IPCC (2013, 2014a, b) assessed the new knowledge with empirical studies, whereby political, historical, social and environmental themes were scrutinised to transform normal political behaviour into an urgent securitisation process. Priority activities of government and people try to avoid further disasters, loss and risks. These studies converted climate change into a matter of security. However, with the exception of the highly affected countries which year by year suffer from the impacts of climate change extreme events, the global audience continues with its normal behaviour. Political and economic deniers in the US and elsewhere, who reinforce their fossil fuel lobby, have done enormous damage to this securitisation process. Notwithstanding the small achievement in Paris in 2015, which will be unable to reduce drastically the GHG emission in order to avoid further risks and threats, 'business as usual' behaviour predominates, which is increasing the anthropogenic GHG in the atmosphere towards dangerous and soon irreversible levels. The agreed maximum of 450 ppm of CO 2 emissions will be exceeded, as the Mauna Loa station reported 412 ppm of CO 2 (NOAA 2018) in May 2018.

However, although this widened approach may allow better interrelation of previously separated security issues, there are still epistemological and methodological hurdles between security thinkers that try to prohibit bridge-building between scientific disciplines (Economy, Sociology, Anthropology and Environmental Studies).

These processes produced a decline in the international order and the traditional security threats. However, there was an increase in intra-state conflicts in Africa and recently non-traditional wars, such as the drug wars, happening especially in Latin America. All these violent actions produced unrelenting cost of human lives, survival, risks and threats. With its human security approach, UNDP (1994) put the individual, his or her environment and livelihood at the centre. Human security proposed a deepening approach to security that refers humankind as the main referent object. This approach starts with the individual, scales up to the family, the village, the nation, the region, the international and the global or planetary security. The individual is considered as the centre, whose security must be protected. Human security analyses many interrelated variables, such as economic, social, political, environmental and technological factors. The concept recognises that \"lasting stability cannot be achieved if people are not protected from a wide variety of threats to their lives and livelihoods\". The UN Security Council extended the meaning of the concept to international peace and security, which cover conflicts that are more domestic and with higher humanitarian impacts.",

Gender security is socially constructed and systemic within the present patriarchal society, and it is normally taken for granted. The relations are linked to gender status, ethnicity/race, class, age and minority status in relation to the model of reference. Equity and identity are the values at risk. The source of threats in the first instance come from the patriarchal hierarchical and violent order, characterised by exclusive, dominant and authoritarian institutions such as non-democratic governments, churches and economic \u00e9lites.

(2009) proposed a third process, called sectorialisation of security that linked to policy problems such as energy, food, water, health, livelihood and climate security. The author asserted that these sectorial security concepts can be analysed by different dimensions and with different referent objects. Water security (Chap. 14) has different meanings for the suppliers (e.g. multinational water enterprises, local governments), who are interested in high prices and low standards of water quality. Conversely, the consumers are pressuring for an uninterrupted supply of high quality drinking water at an affordable price. Health security has similar problems (WHO 2007) when the providers are multinational health and pharmaceutical enterprises. Health security (Chap. 15) is further directly related to water security and most infant deaths in the Global South still occur because of polluted water and diarrhoea. Consumers require a safe and permanent health service which does not destroy their limited budget or produce life-long debt. Food security (Chap. 16) was introduced early by FAO (1983) with the aim of eliminating hunger and malnutrition. However, multinational food enterprises are more interested in selling low quality food at high prices and controlling the supply of basic grains to the Global South with genetically modified organisms. Their modern cluster approach to food security creates reliance on technology, production processes and chemical inputs, thus small producers in the North and the South become dependent on these technologies. But often such crops do not provide the quality of food people traditionally ate and need for a healthy life. Further, this industrialised agriculture has multiple negative impacts on soil depletion, GHG related to long-distance food trade, and impoverishment of small-scale farmers in the Global South because of subsidised agriculture in the Global North. All these factors are changing the food security paradigm towards a green agricultural food sovereignty, as promoted by Via Campesina (2013 , 2016 ), and FAO (2012 , 2016 has reinforced this paradigm shift.",

Training courses, rainwater harvesting, green roofs and renewable energy are ways in which individuals and collectives can adapt and improve their resilience for confronting better the unknown impacts of climate change and post-disaster disruption.",

Chapter 21 explores some ways to confront greater uncertainty, unknown risks and strong impacts of climate change. World-view undoubtedly produces conceptual lenses which influence scientific approaches and the interpretation of the securitising process. Are we on the edge of the knife or do we still trust the technological fix that allows us to continue with the cornucopian horn and massive use of fossil oil? Who will profit from the technological advances, who will decide to be included in this process, and how many people globally will be excluded? These are some of the key questions in the last chapter of this book. When we include in the analysis the threat from climate change impacts at local, national, regional and international scale, the stress and the risks are increasing among people of low income or those living in regions highly exposed to drought, flood or sea level rise. Migration and temporal mobility are disrupting existing livelihoods, and also affecting cultural identity and the conditions of survival ( Fig. 1.2) . Women are especially impacted by the lack of water, health and food security, but at the same time in practice it is women and girls who are able to resolve this scarcity locally by fetching water, healing with traditional medicine and producing subsistence crops in their orchards. This sustainable food production not only has the potential to increase the nutritional level of the whole family, but also cares for the environment and may restore depleted soils which were previously exposed to industrialised agriculture with high agrochemical inputs.",

During scarcity and especially when pastoralists invade agricultural land and the water sources of farmers, violent conflicts may explode (Kenya). In the past, there were cultural mediators, who managed the access to water resources among the conflictive groups, but with access to modern arms and lack of governmental control, violence can break out easily (Le Cour Grandmaison 1984) . Farmers are then often obliged to leave their traditional village, migrate to shanty towns and lose their cultural links and communitarian support (Oswald . Chaotically growing big cities in the Global South represent economic and cultural challenges for both governments and newcomers, who often are pushed towards the most dangerous and risky places to settle down. In this urban context, multiple anti-traditionalist movements rise. Some religious beliefs lose their link with reality, other movements become radical, defending their former lifestyle and well-being, some ally with terrorist groups, and other groups pressure the government to improve livelihood and environmental conditions. Especially among the youth, different violent terrorist groups have appeared, which often call attention to their nonconformity with extremist actions. Conflicts may increase in regions with existing land conflicts when multinational enterprises promote land-grabbing or mining activities. Corporate enterprises, only interested in short-term high profits, may accelerate the existing tensions and break the existing fragile equilibrium. In these conditions, sometimes local conflicts may spread fast to entire regions and also generate transboundary confrontations over scarce resources. Land, water and food security are crucial themes to increase or reduce conflicts, because they directly affect the personal and community life and the survival conditions of the involved people.",

Nature and humankind are complementary, thus harmony with nature, community life, cosmic rights, reciprocity and social control are crucial.
