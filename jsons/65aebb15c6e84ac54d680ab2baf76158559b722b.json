            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are two positive-strand RNA viruses sharing a similar biology, but causing opposing infection outcomes, with HAV always being cleared and HCV establishing persistence in the majority of infections. To gain deeper insight into determinants of replication, persistence, and treatment, we established a homogenous cell-culture model allowing a thorough comparison of RNA replication of both viruses. By screening different human liver-derived cell lines with subgenomic reporter replicons of HAV as well as of different HCV genotypes, we found that Huh7-Lunet cells supported HAV-and HCV-RNA replication with similar efficiency and limited interference between both replicases. HAV and HCV replicons were similarly sensitive to interferon (IFN), but differed in their ability to establish persistent replication in cell culture. In contrast to HCV, HAV replicated independently from microRNA-122 and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIa and b (PI4KIII). Both viruses were efficiently inhibited by cyclosporin A and NIM811, a nonimmunosuppressive analog thereof, suggesting an overlapping dependency on cyclophilins for replication. However, analysis of a broader set of inhibitors revealed that, in contrast to HCV, HAV does not depend on cyclophilin A, but rather on adenosine-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters and FK506-binding proteins. Finally, silibinin, but not its modified intravenous formulation, efficiently inhibited HAV genome replication in vitro, suggesting oral silibinin as a potential therapeutic option for HAV infections. Conclusion: We established a cell-culture model enabling comparative studies on RNA replication of HAV and HCV in a homogenous cellular background with comparable replication efficiency. We thereby identified new host cell targets and potential treatment options for HAV and set the ground for future studies to unravel determinants of clearance and persistence.

            "text": "H epatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are two hepatotropic positive-strand RNA viruses sharing a similar biology, but causing very different infection outcomes. Worldwide, approximately 160 million people are infected with HCV, a member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV establishes persistence in up to 70%-80% of cases, which often results in severe liver damage. This high rate of persistence is quite unusual for a positive-strand RNA virus, and the underlying reasons are only poorly understood. 1 In contrast, HAV, a picornavirus causing acute self-limited hepatitis, never leads to chronic infection. Counterintuitive to infection outcomes, HCV usually induces a high, long-lasting interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, whereas this is very limited in HAV-infected chimpanzees. 2 HAV infections are frequent in developing countries, but also in European countries or in the United States epidemiological HAV outbreaks occur frequently and are mostly derived from contaminated food. [3] [4] [5] HAV infection may result in severe or even fulminant hepatitis, a condition that is more likely to develop in patients at higher age or with chronic liver disease, 3 including HCV/HAV coinfection. 6 However, owing to availability of a vaccine in the early 1990s, research interest in HAV has ceased until recently. This explains the lack of treatment options for HAV infections, though these could shorten and attenuate disease as well as restrict epidemiological outbreaks. In contrast, comprehensive screening programs have brought up a number of highly efficient drugs inhibiting HCV replication by targeting viral and host cell factors, for example, cyclophilin A (CypA) and microRNA-122 (miR122). 7 In addition, picornaviruses related to HAV were reported to depend on the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4kinase (PI4K) IIIb, 8 whereas HCV requires PI4KIIIa for replication. 9 These observations argue for potential similarities in host factor usage of the two viruses.",

Methods for in vitro transcription, electroporation of replicon RNA, and reporter assays have been described in a previous work. 19 Fig. 1.

(B) Replication fitness of HAV or HCV subgenomic replicons in Huh7, Huh7-Lunet, or Huh7.5 hepatoma cells. 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after electroporation of HAV or HCV reporter replicons, cells were harvested for measurement of luciferase activity. Graph represents mean and standard deviation (SD) of r.l.u. normalized to 4 hours. Data are derived from two independent experiments and depicted in logarithmic scale (n 5 2). (C) Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected with 0.1-1.0 mg of RNA of selectable subgenomic replicons of HCV (BlrCon1) or HAV (BlrHAV) and selected for blasticidin resistance (2.5 mg/mL). Colonies were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and colony number per mg RNA was calculated (n 5 2). (D) HCV-, but not HAV-RNA, replication depends on miR122. Hep3B hepatoma cells, naturally devoid of endogenous miR122, were electroporated with HAV or HCV subgenomic replicons either alone or in combination with miR122 or the inactive mutant, miR122_A4U. Graph shows mean and SD of r.l.u. measured from two independent experiments performed with triplicates (n 5 2) at the given time points after electroporation. Data are represented in logarithmic scale and were not normalized owing to the effect of miR122 on HCV-RNA stability and translation efficiency, which is evident already 4 hours after transfection. Note that owing to presence of the PI upstream of the luciferase coding sequence in the H77 reporter replicon construct, luciferase translation is independent of miR122.

Our first aim was to establish a cell-culture system supporting robust HAV-and HCV-RNA replication, thereby allowing comparative investigation of both viruses. To this end, we used subgenomic HAV and HCV firefly luciferase reporter replicons (Fig. 1A) and measured their replication efficiency by quantifying luciferase reporter activity upon electroporation into various human liver-derived cell lines. HCV gt2a (JFH) replicated with high efficiency in the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, and its subclones, Huh7-Lunet and Huh7.5, whereas HCV gt1 (Con1, H77) RNA replication was highest in Huh7-Lunet cells and far less efficient in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells, as reported before 15 (Fig. 1B) . HAV replicated with similar efficiency in all three cell lines and luciferase activity levels were comparable to gt1 in Huh7-Lunet, suggesting that this cell clone was well suited for comparative analyses of HCV-and HAV-RNA replication. The human hepatoma cell line, Huh6, only supported RNA replication of HAV and HCV gt2a (JFH), though to a much lesser extent than Huh7-derived cell lines (Supporting Fig. 1A ). No transient replication of HAV or HCV replicons could be observed in HepG2, HepaRG, or FrHK4 (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a colonyformation assay (CFA) using selectable replicons, which is also well established as a quantitative measure of HCV replication. 20 However, albeit replicating with similar efficiency in the transient model, HCV Con1 was 100-fold more efficient in establishing single-cell clones (Fig. 1C) . This hinted to a higher capability of the HCV replicase to establish persistent replication, as observed in vivo, but precluded the CFA for comparative analysis of HCV and HAV replication efficiency.",

Although comparison of several published genome sequences revealed that the HAV genome does not contain any conserved miR122-binding sites, we tested whether HAV indirectly depended on miR122. Therefore, we first used the human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B, lacking miR122 and measured HAV and HCV RNA upon coelectroporation of the different replicons with or without miR122 or a defective miR122 mutant (miR122_A4U; Fig. 1D ). HAV replication was robust in Hep3B cells, whereas HCV-RNA replication was strongly dependent on miR122 coelectroporation (Fig.  1D ), indicating that HAV-RNA replication does not require miR122. Because HCV gt1 replication was very low in Hep3B, even in the presence of miR122, we confirmed these results by using a miR122 antagonist (mirVana) in Huh7-Lunet. Again, all HCV isolates were highly dependent on this miRNA, whereas HAV was not affected by miR122 sequestration (Supporting Fig. 1B ). In summary, HAV and HCV are able to replicate in an identical set of human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7, Huh6, and Hep3B). However, in contrast to HCV, HAV-RNA replication was independent of miR122. Because RNA replication of HAV and all HCV isolates proved to be robust and comparable in Huh7-Lunet cells, we used this cell line for further comparative studies of the two viruses.",

HAV and HCV gt1 and gt2a RNA replication were inhibited with similar efficiency by IFN-a (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ]: 3.50-5.14 IU/mL), IFN-k (IC 50 , 0.07-0.14 ng/mL), and IFN-c (IC 50 , 0.02-0.07 ng/mL; Fig. 2A -C; Table 1 ).

HCV-RNA replication strictly depends on PI4KIIIa, 9 whereas for several members of the Picornaviridae family, as well as for HCV gt1a and 1b, a requirement for PI4KIIIb has been reported. 8, 11 To clarify, whether one of the two PI4KIII isoforms might be involved in HAV-RNA replication, we utilized the small-molecule inhibitors, AL-9 or PIK93, specifically targeting PI4KIIIa or PI4KIIIb, respectively. 10, 11 As expected, AL-9 strongly inhibited replication of all HCV isolates in absence of cytostatic effects ( Fig. 3A and Supporting Fig. 2A) . However, HAV remained unaffected by AL-9, arguing against a role of PI4KIIIa for HAV-RNA replication (Fig. 3A) . This notion was confirmed in Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing a shRNA targeting PI4KIIIa expression (shPI4KIIIa; Fig. 3B ). To assess whether HAV-RNA replication depended on PI4KIIIb, we measured sensitivity of HAV-and HCV-RNA replication to the PI4KIIIb inhibitor, PIK93. Interestingly, PIK93 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent and strong inhibition of HCV gt1b (Con1) replication, whereas HCV gt1a and gt2a as well as HAV-RNA replication remained almost unaffected (Fig. 3C) . Only the highest concentration of PIK93 (10 mM) caused a slight reduction in HAV and JFH replication, possibly owing to mild cytostatic effects of the drug at this concentration (Supporting Fig. 2A) . Additionally, to thoroughly assess a potential involvement of PI4KIIIb in HAV replication, we applied the CRISPR-CAS9 technique based on a guideRNA targeting PI4KIIIb to establish PI4KIIIb-knockout cells (Fig. 3D ). One cell clone (Clone C1) had a complete knockout of PI4KIIIb and was therefore chosen for further studies, as well as a cell pool characterized by reduced PI4KIIIb levels (Pool3) to control for clonal effects ( Fig. 3D) . HCV gt2a and HAV replication differed only slightly between parental cells, Clone C1 and Pool3 (Fig. 3E) , confirming the independence of HAV and JFH replication from PI4KIIIb. HCV gt1b replication was tremendously impaired in cell lines with a reduced expression of PI4KIIIb, in contrast to HCV gt2a and in line with data gained from PIK93 treatment (Fig. 3E) . HCV gt1a RNA replication was drastically reduced in Clone C1 and in Pool3 as well, hinting at a role of PI4KIIIb for gt1 in general (Fig.  3E ). In conclusion, HCV gt2a RNA replication strongly depended on PI4KIIIa, whereas HCV gt1b and, most likely, gt1a RNA replication relied on both kinases. In contrast to HCV and other picornaviruses, neither PI4KIIIa nor PI4KIIIb are required for HAV-RNA replication.",

            "text": "HCV-and HAV-RNA Replication Is Sensitive to CsA, but Involves a Differential Set of Target Proteins. CypA, a member of the immunophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases, represents another cellular factor involved in HCV replication. Hence, we probed whether HAV also depended on members of the immunophilin family and therefore analyzed inhibition of viral RNA replication by various immunophilin inhibitors. As shown before, CsA, a cyclic undecapeptide inhibiting a wide range of Cyps, 12, 21 blocked RNA replication of all HCV isolates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) . In addition CsA inhibited HAV replication, albeit with lower efficiency, indicating that different immunophilins might be involved in HCV and HAV replication, respectively (Fig. 4A) . To analyze the dependency of HAV on CypA and other Cyps, we used NIM811, a nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog with similar structure, 12, 22 and SFA, a structurally unrelated Cyp inhibitor, 12 which is unlikely to have further common targets with CsA and NIM811 apart from Cyps. Furthermore, we applied specific knockdown of CypA, which is the Cyp most important for HCV. As expected, NIM811 inhibited HCV replication with even higher efficiency than CsA, whereas its effect on HAV replication was comparable to CsA-induced inhibition ( Fig. 4B ; Table 1 and Supporting Table 2 ). In contrast, SFA treatment inhibited all HCV isolates to a similar extent as CsA and NIM811, but resulted only in a marginal decrease of HAV replication. This suggested either that HAV utilized immunophilins, which were not efficiently inhibited by SFA, or that HAV replication might be independent from cyclophilins ( Fig. 4C ; Table 1 and Supporting Table 2 ). Indeed, HCV replication was dramatically reduced for all HCV isolates in shCypA cells, 16 whereas HAV replicated with equal efficiency in shCypA and shONT cells, arguing against a role of CypA for HAV-RNA replication (Supporting Fig. 3A ). Given that CsA not only inhibits Cyps, but also ABC transporters, 23 we implemented further inhibitors to narrow down potential targets involved in the CsA-mediated inhibition of HAV replication. PSC833 is a CsA analog not blocking Cyp activity, but still inhibiting ABC transporters such as p-glycoprotein (ABCB1). 12, 23 Reversan and Piperine inhibit p-glycoprotein and other ABC transporters without being structurally related to CsA. 13, 14 Indeed, PSC833 inhibited HAV and not HCV replication (Supporting Fig. 3B ), but strong cytostatic effects on Huh7-Lunet questioned the specificity of the inhibition (Supporting Fig. 2A) . However, the involvement of certain ABC transporters in HAV-RNA replication was further supported by the dosedependent inhibition upon treatment with Reversan (Fig. 4D) and Piperine ( Fig. 4E ; Table 1 and Supporting Table 2 ), which exerted less-pronounced cytostatic effects (Supporting Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, Piperine and Reversan additionally inhibited HCV isolate Con1 and the latter, also to a lesser extent, H77, indicating that ABC transporters might play a role for HCV gt1 as well (Fig. 4D ,E; Table 1 and Supporting Table 2 ). Owing to the large number of human ABC transporters (49 encoded in the human genome), most of which are poorly characterized, 24 and considering the lack of specific inhibitors, we did not undertake further efforts to identify distinct candidates. Instead, we focused on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), another class of immunophilins with peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerase activity, which can be inhibited by the immunosuppressant, FK506 (Tacrolimus). 21 We observed a dose-dependent and strong inhibition of HAV-RNA replication by FK506 at noncytostatic concentrations, whereas HCV replication was not affected by this drug, suggesting that HAV-RNA replication depends on FKBPs rather than Cyps (Fig. 4F) .",

Thus far, our data revealed no individual common host factor of HCV and HAV replication, but rather pointed to a related set of functions exploited by both viruses. To get a general overview on cellular resources occupied by HCV and HAV, we examined viral competition by cotransfecting firefly luciferase (LucHAV, LucJFH) and renilla luciferase (R-LucJFH) reporter replicons into Huh7-Lunet cells (Fig. 5A ). In case of largely overlapping sets of host factors, we expected a strong interference between both replicons, whereas a lack of interference would indicate that both viruses replicate in different subcellular niches. Given that JFH1 replication was much more efficient and faster than HAV, we included a JFH1 replicon containing a chimeric 3' nontranslated region (NTR) that attenuates replication efficiency. 18 Indeed, the presence of wild-type (wt) JFH strongly suppressed HAV-RNA replication, which remained unaffected, when combined with the replicationdeficient control, JFHdGDD (Fig. 5B) . In contrast, R-LucJFH RNA replication was not affected by coelectroporation of HAV RNA (Fig. 5C) . However, the JFH chimera (R-LucJFH X-tail Con1/JFH X-tail Con1), with reduced replication fitness, only marginally impaired HAV-RNA replication (Fig. 5B) , arguing against largely overlapping sets of limiting host factors between the two viruses. This result rather suggested limitations of global cellular resources in the presence of JFH wt, which reaches maximal replication levels already at 24 hours after transfection (Fig. 5C) . In support of this view, JFH wt had a stronger relative impact on replication of R-LucJFH X-tail Con1 than on HAV, probably owing to the additional competition for limiting host factors and replication within the same subcellular compartment (Fig. 5B,D) . To confirm that cells indeed were transfected with both replicons, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) analysis (Fig. 5E ). Almost all cells were positive for HCV nonstructural (NS) protein 5A (NS5A), whereas only a few cells stained positive for HAV, most likely owing to lower replication levels of HAV and the limited sensitivity of the anti-3C antibody. However, several cells were clearly double positive for HAV and HCV, confirming that both replicons were able to replicate within the same cell and corroborating the notion of only limited competition between viral replicases (Fig. 5E ). In support of this assumption, HCV NS5A and HAV 3C also did not colocalize substantially in double-positive cells, which was further confirmed in an expression model using HCV NS3-5B and HAV 2A-3D (Supporting Fig. 4A,C) , also showing that HAV 3C primarily colocalized with mitochondria (Supporting Fig. 4B,C) .",

However, HAV-RNA replication was fully resistant to SIL, whereas HCV gt1a and gt1b replication, in contrast to gt2a, were efficiently suppressed (Fig. 6A) , as published earlier. 18 Surprisingly, the oral formulation, silibinin, blocked HAV-, but not HCV-RNA, replication with an IC 50 value of 18.84 mg/mL, corresponding to 39.05 mM (Fig. 6B; Table 1 ), suggesting that oral silibinin might represent a potential treatment option for HAV-infected patients.",

However, in a CFA, reflecting the ability to establish persistent replication, HCV replicons were substantially more efficient. Although we cannot rule out an impact of the differing replicon design, this result indicates that the replicases of both viruses might have a different capability to maintain long-term replication in the same cells or that persistent HAV replication exerts cytopathic effects. It will be the subject of future studies to see how these phenotypes in cell culture contribute to the differing natural history of infection in vivo. Furthermore, availability of a homogenous cell-culture system for both viruses will enable studies of activation and blockade of innate immune responses by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and TIRdomain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-b (TRIF) cleavage, which is achieved by proteases of HAV and HCV. 26 Despite being capable of blocking innate immune responses, HCV induces high ISG levels in acute and chronic infection, preferentially in infected cells, 27, 28 whereas almost no ISGs are induced in livers of HAV-infected chimpanzees, 2 suggesting that HAV either has a lower capability of stimulating innate immunity or is more efficient in cleaving the critical adaptor proteins. However, induction of ISGs seems to be a factor promoting persistence, given that we found very similar sensitivity of both replicases to type I, II, and III IFNs, in line with studies on HCV and HAV infection in vitro. 29, 30 This seems somehow counterintuitive, but reducing antigen loads by a well-dosed induction of ISGs in the case of HCV might dampen efficiency of recognition by the adaptive immune system, thereby preventing eradication of infected cells.",

There are at least 16 different human Cyps and 12 human FKBPs, which are involved in various cellular processes. 21 Furthermore, Cyps are involved in replication of a wide range of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and several coronaviruses, 21 whereas also FKBPs play a role for the latter. 33 Furthermore, CypA represents an essential host factor for HCV. 16 We assessed the dependency of HAV on different immunophilin members by usage of a diverse set of inhibitors. From the inhibition profiles, we deduced that most Cyps are not involved in HAV-RNA replication. Still, we cannot exclude Cyps being utilized, which are not blocked or inhibited, to a lesser extent, by the inhibitors. However, it seems more likely that the block of HAV replication by CsA and structurally related compounds is a result of inhibition of ABC transporters such as p-glycoprotein, 34 which are additional targets of CsA, but most likely not of SFA. 35 Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Reversan and Piperine, two more specific inhibitors of ABC transporters, supports the concept of a potential role of ABC transporters for HAV-RNA replication. Given that HAV replication is inhibited by nonimmunosuppressive CsA analogs, which are in clinical development for HCV therapy, 36 such compounds might represent a future treatment option for HAV as well.",

Recently, it became apparent that the IV formulation, Legalon-SIL, exerts antiviral activity against HCV, 37 likely by targeting formation of viral replica-tion sites. 18 We observed no such activity against HAV replication. However, the oral formulation, silibinin, efficiently inhibited HAV-, but not HCV-RNA, replication, suggesting different modes of action for oral silibinin and Legalon-SIL. Importantly, silibinin, which does not induce significant side effects, even in high doses (up to 2.1 g/day for 24 weeks), 38 might therefore represent a safe, effective, and cheap treatment option for HAV infections. Indeed, protection from HAV infection might have contributed to the proverbial hepatoprotective effects of silibinin. However, in vivo potency of silibinin has to be confirmed in a cellbased virus assay and, in particular, in clinical studies. In addition, it would be interesting to clarify its mechanism of action and analyze occurrence of viral resistance.",

Future studies employing full-length viruses and focusing on the differential ISG induction by HAV and HCV will shed light on the high capability of HCV to establish chronic infections and help to understand general features of viral persistence.",
