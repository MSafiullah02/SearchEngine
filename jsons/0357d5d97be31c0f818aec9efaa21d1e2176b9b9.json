COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the main way of transmission. Currently, the research on COVID-19 is growing at great speed. Italy is one of the country showing the highest rate of mortality in the world, mainly in the northern regions [2] . While pre-existing pulmonary and cardiovascular disease as well as diabetes mellitus are known risk factors for the worst outcome for COVID-19 [3] , the impact of chronic rheumatic diseases, and, in particular, if the risk of COVID-19 while using a biologic agent (b-DMARD) or a small molecule (ts-DMARD) for chronic inflammatory arthritis is higher than in the general population, is still unknown [1] . Biologic agents increase the risk for infections, although the advantages largely overcome that risk [4] . Moreover, the most severe complication of COVID-19 pneumonia seem to be caused by a cytokine storm syndrome [5] as an exaggerated response of the immune system to the virus [4, 6] for whom many rheumatic drugs, including biologic agents, are currently under investigations [7, 8] .",

The cases were all the adult patients with a rheumatic disease and who were under treatment with a b-or a ts-DMARD from September 2019 to April 2020 in the province of Udine, Italy. A computer database from the Pharmacy service of the province of Udine recording past and present treatments with b/ts-DMARDs in the same cases was used. All the clinical charts of these cases were revised to verify they were proceeding with treatment at the last contact. The prevalence of COVID-19 during the month of March 2020 and April 2020 was compared to that of the general population in the province of Udine after excluding subjects \u2264 15 years old (a total of 466,700 inhabitants), the first COVID-19 case in this province being reported on February 29, 2020. Importantly, in our region, all the patients who undergo a biologic or small molecule treatment must be evaluated by a public consultant rheumatologist every six months for renewing and proceeding with their own therapeutic plan and then they need to be registered by the Pharmacy service that supplies the drug about every two months until to the treatment plan expiration.",

On the contrary, b-DMARDs and ts-DMARDs put patients at significantly higher risk of infections [6] , especially in the respiratory tract, than the general population. Therefore, our result is reassuring for clinicians, and, thus, b-or ts-DMARDs in rheumatic diseases could neither substantially increase the risk of COVID-19, nor worsen the course of COVID-19, when it occurs.

The number of patients, who were tested for COVID-19 (4.5%) was similar to the reference population (4.3%). However, among rheumatic patients tested for COVID-19, only one third (15/47, 31.9%) referred to healthcare providers for symptoms compatible with COVID-19, thus underlying a possible social behavior of patients with rheumatic disease (i.e., being more careful in social contacts because of their immunosuppression) that likely played an important role in infection rate and control. This feature needs appropriate studies. Overall, it is an important observation, though it needs to be confirmed by other groups, since this is a large population of chronic immunosuppressed patients, and, among the different subgroups of rheumatic patients, they probably represent those at highest risk for infectious complications both for their own clinical characteristics (age, comorbidity, moderate to severe inflammatory chronic rheumatic disease) and related treatments (chronic glucocorticosteroids, b-or ts-DMARD, long disease duration, combination of two immunosuppressors), as already known [17] . We limited our analysis to rheumatic diseases that 8 biologics are at greater infectious risk than the others. Previous epidemiologic data also in our region of Italy supported this notion [18] . The possible mitigation of symptoms by biologic agents or small molecules cannot be excluded, thus causing an underestimation of COVID-19 in our study population. Finally, the weight of antimalarials in possibly decreasing the prevalence of COVID-19 in our study population was negligible (<10%). However, antimalarials failed to reduce mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a recent randomized controlled trial [19] , and further studies are warranted [20] .",
