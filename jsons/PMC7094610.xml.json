            "text": "Infections that spread predominantly in healthcare settings pose potential threats to public health, and cause considerable morbidity each year. Occasionally emerging infectious diseases cause community infections and major social disruption after initial spread in hospitals, for example the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003, the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in 2014-15, and the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea (Ansumana et al., 2017, Ho et al., 2003, Ki, 2015). Nosocomial infections may lead to outbreaks among patients and healthcare workers, and may even spillover to the local community when visitors are infected, leading to prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality in hospital patients and increased medical costs in the community. In healthcare settings, respiratory and enteric bacteria and viruses can be transmitted through direct or indirect physical contact (fomites), or through the air as respiratory droplets or droplet nuclei (also referred to as aerosols). There are wide range of systematic and individual-based interventions attempted to mitigate aerosol transmission in healthcare settings.",

            "text": "Health care-associated infection (HCAI), also known as nosocomial infection, is defined as \u2018an infection occurring in a patient during the process of care in a hospital or other health-care facility which was not present or incubating at the time of admission. This includes infections acquired in the hospital, but appearing after discharge, and also occupational infections among staff of the facility (Benenson, 1995). It is traditionally believed that most HCAIs become apparent at least 48 h after admission to the healthcare facilities (Horan et al., 2008, World Health Organization, 2011), but this definition may not apply to viral infections that have longer mean incubation periods for example measles (12.5 days), adenoviruses (5.6 days), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 4.4 days), SARS (4.0 days) and other human coronaviruses (3.2 days), and parainfluenza virus (2.6 days) (Lessler et al., 2009). Theoretically patients (hospitalized or outpatient), healthcare workers (HCWs) and visitors such as the family members of hospitalized patients can all acquire nosocomial infection, but it is more difficult to ascertain nosocomial infections in outpatients and visitors as they could also acquire the infection from the community (Aitken & Jeffries, 2001). Therefore, studies of nosocomial infections mostly focus on infections developed in hospitalized patients or HCWs.",

In both high-income and LMIC settings, there is a considerable burden in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and patients admitted to emergency and intensive care unit (ICU) and those with impaired functional status are associated with more nosocomial infections (World Health Organization, 2011). In LMICs, infants less than one year of age or patients with multiple comorbidities are also at higher risk of nosocomial infections (World Health Organization, 2011). In China, it has been reported that 16.2% of ICU patients developed ICU-acquired pneumonia with a mortality rate of 37% (Zhang et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Viruses are considered as the most common cause of infectious diseases acquired within indoor environments (Brankston, Gitterman, Hirji, Lemieux, & Gardam, 2007), and many nosocomial infections are due to respiratory and enteric infections of viruses (Belliot et al., 2014, Bruijning-Verhagen et al., 2012, Kambhampati et al., 2015, Rhinehart et al., 2012). Recent examples of particular concern are emerging infectious diseases such as SARS outbreaks in 2003, the outbreak of EVD in West Africa in 2014-15, and the on-going MERS outbreaks in the Middle East since 2012, where many HCWs were infected and acted as the amplifiers for the spread to the community (Ansumana et al., 2017, Ho et al., 2003, Ki, 2015, Shears and O'Dempsey, 2015). For human avian influenza viruses, although no strong evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus, there have been reports suggesting nosocomial transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, potentially through aerosols or droplets (Chen et al., 2016, Fang et al., 2015). Infections among HCWs also significantly impeded outbreak controls (Chan, 2014). On the other hand, endemic respiratory and enteric viruses also cause hospital outbreaks regularly. Human seasonal influenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory tract infections both in the community and in hospitals. Salgado, Farr, Hall, and Hayden (2002) reviewed 12 influenza outbreaks in hospitals, and reported the patient infection rates ranged from 3% to 50% in wards affected by the outbreaks compared to 0.7\u201320% throughout the hospital. Outbreaks of influenza B virus have also been reported in hospitalized older adults (Seale et al., 2009, Van Voris et al., 1982). Other respiratory viruses including adenovirus, rhino/enterovirus, metapneumovirus and RSV could also cause nosocomial infections in pediatric and adult patients (Chow and Mermel, 2017, La Rosa et al., 2013, Sakata et al., 1998, Silva Cde et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2014). We previously reported an outbreak of human metapneumovirus in a hospital ward with bedridden patients with severe motor-and-intellectual disabilities (Yang et al., 2014). For enteric infections, based on the data captured by a German surveillance system, 49% of the norovirus-related and 14% of rotavirus-related hospitalizations were acquired nosocomially, with 65% and 41% in older adults, and 16% and 16% in infants less than one year of age for nosocomial norovirus and rotavirus infections respectively (Lindsay et al., 2015, Spackova et al., 2010). Nosocomial outbreaks of rotaviruses and noroviruses also happened frequently (Bruijning-Verhagen et al., 2012, Kambhampati et al., 2015, Rhinehart et al., 2012). In addition to those mentioned above, other respiratory and enteric viruses such as measles virus and varicella-zoster virus can also cause epidemics in hospitals through airborne transmission, which often leads to serious consequences (Aitken and Jeffries, 2001, Herfst et al., 2016).",

Different transmission routes could also interplay with each other. For example, on one hand, inanimate objects contaminated with pathogens from patients\u2019 secretions such as saliva, nasal fluid and feces (fomites) can serve as vehicles for the spread of pathogens directly, contributing to indirect contact transmission (Mubareka et al., 2009); on the other hand, disturbance to fomites (e.g. by toilet flushing) leads to resuspension and generation of contaminated aerosols (La Rosa et al., 2013), contributing to aerosol transmission. In general, viruses infected with aerosol exposure seem to have greater replication efficiency in vivo, such as influenza viruses (Zhang et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Aerosol transmission refers to the dissemination of either droplet nuclei or small particles (aerosols) in the respirable size range containing pathogenic microorganisms that remain infective over time and distance (Siegel et al., 2007). In contrast, droplet transmission occurs when larger particles containing pathogenic microorganisms travel through the air in short distances (unusually suggested as within 1 m / 3 feet) (World Health Organization, 2014) to the mouth, nasal mucosa, ocular conjunctiva or other parts of the susceptible population. To classify between droplet and aerosol transmission, respiratory droplets are typically defined as particles with an aerodynamic diameter > 5 \u00b5m, and aerosols as those \u2264 5 \u00b5m, since the latter is believed to be deposited in the alveolar region of human lung by settlement (Duguid, 1946, Siegel et al., 2007). Larger inhaled particles (mainly droplets) will deposit in the head airway or trachea-bronchial regions of the respiratory tract, whereas smaller particles (mainly aerosols or droplet nuclei) will primarily deposit in the alveoli (Hinds, 1999, Jones and Brosseau, 2015). However, the proportion of particles that are inhaled and deposit in different regions of the respiratory tract (and therefore classified as via the droplet or aerosol route accordingly) are determined by particle aerodynamic diameter as well as lung morphology and breathing characteristics (Nazaroff, 2016). Separately, some define aerosols as those which can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time with potentially a higher risk of transmission through the air. Particles with aerodynamic diameter around 20 \u00b5m take 4 min to fall for a vertical distance of 3 m and those around 5 \u00b5m take an hour to fall for the same height (Knight, 1980, Tellier, 2009). Furthermore, respiratory droplets < 20 \u00b5m at expulsion could transform into droplet nuclei by evaporation and shrinks to a little less than half of the initial diameter (Nicas et al., 2005, Tellier, 2009, Xie et al., 2007). Especially particles with aerodynamic diameter < 5 \u00b5m that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods (La Rosa et al., 2013). Bioaerosols are usually defined as aerosols or particulate matter of microbial, plant or animal origin that is often used synonymously with organic dust (Douwes et al., 2003, Tellier, 2009), which generally include bacteria, fungi, viruses and their derivatives such as endotoxin, glucans and mycotoxin (Guan and Yao, 2010) with particle size varying based on the composition of the aerosols, and could range from submicron for those composed of viral particles to as large as 1 mm for those composed of pollen grains (Haig, Mackay, Walker, & Williams, 2016).",

            "text": "The presence of microorganisms in the air can affect the health of humans and animals. These pathogenic microorganisms are often adsorbed on the solid or liquid particles suspended in the air to form aerosols or droplets, whereas very small amounts of pathogenic microorganisms in the air are usually sufficient to cause infection compared to other modes of transmission (Alford, Kasel, Gerone, & Knight, 1966). For many respiratory viruses, the relative importance of different modes in transmission are controversial if not unknown, and can even vary within the same type of virus depending on the various viral, host and environmental factors (Branch-Elliman et al., 2015, Carlson et al., 2010, Gautret et al., 2014). However, in general, respiratory viruses considered to be transmitted mainly through droplets include SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, RSV and parainfluenza virus, and viruses considered to be transmitted mainly through aerosols include measles (rubeola virus) and chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus) (Hall, 2000, Hall, 1982, Tang et al., 2006, Xie et al., 2007), in addition to other modes such as direct or indirect contact (fomite) transmission (Boone and Gerba, 2007, Pica and Bouvier, 2012). One study showed that a large community outbreak in SARS in Hong Kong could be explained by aerosol transmission (Yu et al., 2004), while another study showed that environmental surfaces in the hospitals could be contaminated with SARS-CoV and therefore contact transmission was considered possible (Dowell et al., 2004). It has been suggested that respiratory transmission of Ebola viruses could occur, although this is controversial (Osterholm et al., 2015, Vetter et al., 2016). Several experimental studies indicate that EBOV can be transmitted through aerosols in various animal species (Jaax et al., 1995, Weingartl et al., 2012). In addition to respiratory viruses, some enteroviruses can also be spread by airborne transmission through aerosol particles. For example, the main symptom of noroviruses infections is vomiting, a fine mist of virus particles passes into the air because of projectile vomiting. Droplets being inhaled by anyone in the immediate vicinity can be deposited in the upper respiratory tract, and subsequently be swallowed along with respiratory mucus (Bonifait et al., 2015). The evidences supporting the relative importance of different modes of transmission for respiratory and enteric viruses are summarized in\nTable 2. Additional discussion on modes of transmissions of these viruses can be found in the review by La Rosa et al. (2013).",

            "text": "For the viruses, its ability to infect the new host relies on whether: 1) viruses can survive in the environment; but survival of airborne virus of different types has a different decay time in the ambient air. For example, H1N1 and H5N1 influenza virus show close trend with regards to inactivation, approximately 60% of the virus was inactivated over the first 30 min at air conditions, however, about 50% of H3N2 viral particles were still alive even after 90 min (Pyankov Oleg, Pyankova Olga, & Agranovski Igor, 2012); 2) viruses can invade the target cell; and 3) there is sufficient virus infective dose. The minimal viral load resulting in infection (i.e. minimal infectious dose) varies between different viruses, for example, the viral load of smallpox virus is 10\u2013100 organisms and the amount of hemorrhagic fever virus is only 1\u201310 organisms (Franz et al., 1997). For the host, as the recipient of the infection, depending on the site of infection and the branches of the immune system that are impaired (e.g. due to aging or immunosuppression), it will have different impacts on the susceptibility to different viruses (Bender et al., 1991, Hobson et al., 1972, Nicholls et al., 2007, Thomas et al., 2006). As the source of infection, the host also affects the risk of infection (in the recipient) via the aerosol route depending on his behavior and the site where the viral particles are released (Hatagishi et al., 2014, Milton et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2015). Environmental factors could also affect virus survival, including temperature, humidity, movement of the air, ultraviolet radiation and organic or inorganic contents where the viral particles are attached (Tang et al., 2006). Temperature can affect microscopically by altering the structure of viral proteins (including proteins that are involved in viral entry and replication) and genome, and could also affect macroscopically by setting up large exchange air flows in space due to temperature difference (Tang, 2009). The influence of humidity on virus survival is mainly related to whether the virus has lipid envelopes or not (Yang & Marr, 2012). But it is important to note that humidity and temperature can interact to affect the survival of viruses in aerosols, viruses decay rapidly in dry and hot environments, and only 4.7% survival over 60 min procedure (Pyankov Oleg, Bodnev Sergey, Pyankova Olga, & Agranovski Igor, 2017). Schaffer, Soergel, and Straube (1976) found that an asymmetrical U-shaped curve for influenza survival with different relative humidity at 21 \u00b0C. Airflow can impact the rate of particle gravitational settling (Jones & Brosseau, 2015). Studies have shown that infectivity of viral aerosols could be reduced by ultraviolet radiation (Jordan, 1961, McDevitt et al., 2012, Walker and Ko, 2007). Higher salt content in the viral aerosols could reduce viability of the viral particles (Yang & Marr, 2012), while organic materials (e.g. blood, feces, mucus and saliva) could buffer against extreme environmental stress on viral particles in aerosols (Tang, 2009).",

The impingement methods are similar to that of impaction, except that the microorganisms are collected into a liquid medium (Ghosh et al., 2015). Some bioaerosol samplers are available by means of impact or impact methods, which can collect a variety of viruses, such as measles virus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus (Bischoff et al., 2016, Lednicky and Loeb, 2013, Nguyen et al., 2016), Cyclone samplers capture microorganisms in a liquid (aerosol to hydrosol) using swirling air and centrifugal force (Ghosh et al., 2015). Grayson, Griffiths, Perez, and Piedimonte (2017) applied stationary 2-stage bioaerosol cyclone samplers to capture RSV-laden particles in a pediatric acute care setting, and their findings indicate that airborne RSV-laden particles can be detected in pediatric outpatient clinics during the epidemic peak. The electrostatic precipitation of airborne particles are mainly precipitated from an airstream by the application of an external force such as electrical force on charged particle (Knutson & Whitby, 1975). Research by Ladhani et al. (2017) showed successful sampling and detection of airborne influenza virus using an electrostatic precipitation (ESP)-based bioaerosol sampler. In filtration methods, airborne microorganisms are collected by passing air through porous membrane filters made of glass fiber, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polycarbonate or cellulose acetate (incubated by transferring onto the surfaces of growth agar media) or gelatin (Ghosh et al., 2015). Membrane filtration and sampling technology of virus can permit monitoring of very low viral content in air (Aintablian et al., 1998, Myatt et al., 2003). Employing these biosamplers, recently there have been increasing studies that demonstrated viruses (including influenza, measles and RSV) can be recovered from the air in healthcare settings (Bischoff et al., 2016, Bischoff et al., 2013, Blachere et al., 2009, Leung et al., 2016, Lindsley et al., 2010).",

Methods such as air filtration system, ionization and high voltage field, ultraviolet radiation, photocatalytic oxidation, dielectric barrier discharge and others have been adopted to purify or decontaminate indoor air (Alonso et al., 2016, Dee et al., 2006, Kozlova et al., 2010, McDevitt et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2014; Hyun et al., 2017). At present, national standards and related technical specifications of air purification are lacking. Medical air purifiers used should meet the following requirements: 1) Safety, should not create secondary air pollution; 2) Convenience, low noise operation, and portable; 3) Effectiveness, can effectively kill different types of pathogens. Air purification technology as a means to reduce or eliminate airborne particles or pathogenic microorganism levels has been reported previously in various fields. Traditionally, ultraviolet radiation is widely used to sanitize air (First, Rudnick, Banahan, Vincent, & Brickner, 2007), Several previous studies have indicated that UV air disinfection protects humans from infectious diseases caused by airborne microorganism (such as influenza virus, pox viruses, rhinovirus and coronavirus), and those experiments also show that virus aerosols are less susceptible to UV at higher RH than at lower RH (McDevitt et al., 2012, McDevitt et al., 2007, McDevitt et al., 2008, Scarpino et al., 1998, Walker and Ko, 2007), but some exceptions exist (Walker & Ko, 2007). In addition, the combination of UV-irradiation and other measures for air purification cannot handle large volumes air due to their limited capacity in buildings (Schulz, Bao, Clauss, & Hartung, 2013).",

            "text": "Air filtration system is another common purification technique, which allows the air to pass through a series of filters of decreasing pore size through positive pressure ventilation. Dee et al. (2006) showed that high-efficiency particulate air filtrations which are capable of blocking the passage of particles 0.3 \u00b5m or more in diameter can significantly reduce PRRSV transmission. In addition, some filters treating with special material (e.g., dialdehyde starch) can disinfect airborne viruses simultaneously (Woo et al., 2012). Similarly, low-cost filtering systems can also filter PRRSV viruses effectively. An electrostatic particle ionization technology that generates a high negative ion output which results in the electrification of airborne particles. The ionized airborne particles are attracted toward opposite charges and may be cleared from the air by adhesion to the walls or other charged surfaces (Alonso et al., 2016). This ionization technique has been extensively applied to the disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms (including viruses) in poultry and livestock houses (Alonso et al., 2016, Mitchell and King, 1994). The ionization technique can also be combined with other purification technologies such as photocatalytic oxidation, which may provide significant pathogen removal efficiency and biocidal capabilities (Grinshpun et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2008). Multiphase photocatalytic technology is based on the penetration of ultraviolet radiation into photocatalyst (such as titanium dioxide, TiO2). The purpose is to produce an air purification technology by generating highly active hydroxyl radicals to viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms (Kozlova et al., 2010, Paschoalino and Jardim, 2008). Grinshpun's research indicates that approximately 90% of initially viable MS2 viruses were inactivated resulting from 10 to 60 min exposure to the photocatalytic oxidation (Grinshpun et al., 2007). Cold oxygen plasma technology can effectively control the viral titers of airborne respiratory viruses (Terrier et al., 2009), and it can be used as effective measure for case management during influenza epidemics. We previously showed that cold plasma showed good pathogenic effect on influenza A (H1N1) virus aerosol, which was similar to that of common UV lamp (Wang et al., 2012).",

            "text": "It was traditionally believed that wearing face masks and respirators can prevent diseases transmitted through droplets and respiratory aerosols (MacIntyre & Chughtai, 2015). A variety of protective devices are used in health care facilities and community settings including cloth masks\uff0cmedical masks (medical, surgical) and respirators (such as N95, N99, N100, P2, P3, FFP2, and FFP3); But there is no consensus around the choice between facemasks and respirators to prevent respiratory diseases (MacIntyre & Chughtai, 2015). The first study of the value of face masks (cloth masks) by healthcare workers began in 1918 (Weaver, 1918). Subsequent studies found that face masks were also used to protect medical personnel from scarlet fever, measles and influenza (MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015, Whitelaw, 1919). During the outbreak of SARS, use of masks in the general population in Hong Kong was high enough to observe an effect on all respiratory infections (Leung et al., 2003, Lo et al., 2005), and face mask use did prevent SARS infections in health care workers (Seto et al., 2003). Medical masks have been widely used for 50 years, and respirators were later specifically designed for respiratory protection (MacIntyre & Chughtai, 2015). Bischoff, Reid, Russell, and Peters (2011) found that N95 respirators provided improved protection compared to medical masks (surgical masks). In addition, that study also described the equal importance of wearing goggles to enhance eye protection. For other diseases that are mainly transmitted through aerosols, such as measles, chickenpox, and other viruses, the surgical mask is not adequate in providing protection against viruses transmitted through aerosols, and filter was needed within the face mask. Nevertheless, there are different opinions regarding the efficacy of face mask for personal isolation and protection. Although Smith et al. (2016) have showed the efficacy of N95 respirators and surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers against acute respiratory infection in a meta-analysis, the study also reported that there was no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in preventing the transmission of acute respiratory infection for the protection of healthcare workers. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are likely needed to evaluate the efficacy of N95 respirators in the prevention of acute respiratory infection. In addition, reuse of facemasks and respirators is widespread globally, but for its safety, the researchers have inconsistent views and lack clinical evidence (MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015; Chughtai et al., 2015; Loeb et al., 2009). We previously reviewed the use of face masks during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (Cowling, Zhou, Ip, Leung, Aiello, 2010), and found that there is some evidence to support the wearing of masks or respirators during illness to protect others from being infected, and more studies in controlled settings and studies of natural infections in healthcare and community settings are needed to better define the effectiveness of faces masks and respirators in preventing influenza virus transmission.",

These infections are a significant problem for hospitalized patients, which can lead to major burden on health and healthcare costs, particularly in the elderly, children and those with underlying diseases. In this article, we review, from the standpoints of epidemiologists and virologists, the burden and signifiances of nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses, the possible role of aerosol transmission in these nosocomial infections, and prevention and control measures of aerosol trasmission of respiratory and enteric virus infections in healthcare settings. There is increasing evidence in the scientific literature that aerosol transmission is an important route of a number of respiratory and enteric viruses. Aerosol transmission of viruses can be affected by intrinsic factors, which include aerosol particles physical properties, virus characteristics and host factors; or extrinsic factors, including environmental temperature and humidity. In view of the possibilities of a large number of respiratory viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms that may exist as aerosol virus particles, including those that are generated from the resuspension from the surface of contaminated objects in the hospital, much prevention and control measures have been adopted to mitigate nosocomial infections via the aerosol route which aim to improve aerosol management and surface sterilization, including engineering solutions, hand hygiene and wearing face masks. However, cross infection of viral infectious diseases, some possibly via aerosols, still exists and occurs in the hospital. A number of challenges remain for new prevention and control measures, as well as applied research: 1) The importance of respiratory pathogens in interpersonal transmission, including the range and form of transmission; 2) the potential of aerosols generated by medical instruments or equipment, as well as during medical procedures; 3) the actual contributions of physical contact, droplets and aerosols in transmission of respiratory pathogens; 4) the efficacy of different types of face masks, efficiency of air purification system in reducing the transmission of respiratory viral influenza, as well as the combined forms and effects with hand hygiene and personal protective measures. At the same time, relevant clinical medical research can also be carried out, such as controlled studies of the impact on these measures on biologically relevant measures (e.g. viral loads) and patient outcomes.",
