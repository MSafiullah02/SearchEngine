[19] [20] [21] It resulted in reductions in both viral protein synthesis and the yield of released viral progeny in EV-A71-infected cells with LiCl, but it only led to a decrease in progeny virus but had no effect on viral protein synthesis. 22 As the treatment might be used for food animal, the food safety of using LiCl as a medicine is also important problem. In order to minimize the risk of LiCl toxicity, careful monitoring, and adjustment of LiCl dosage is especially important.",

FMDV causes an economically important and highly contagious disease of clovenhoofed animals. The use of FMDV vaccines to protect early infection is limited, and the FMDV mutates frequently to escape the immune system. 3, 4, 23 The resulst reveals tha LiCl has potential as an effective anti-FMDV drug. Therefore, LiCl may be an effective drug for the control of FMDV. Based on that, the mechanism of the antiviral effect of LiCl on FMDV infection is need to in-depth research in vivo. ",

The viral yields of the cells were detected by TCID 50 and RT-qPCR in every stage replication stage in cells with dose-dependent. Thirdly, to further investigate what time course of FMDV replication stage was affected by LiCl treatment, cells were exposed to LiCl at several points in the viral replication stage. We have found that LiCl reduced FMDV replication when treated within 12 hpi, suggesting that the early time of viral replication is the target for the antiviral effect of LiCl. The early time of viral replication stage is the time that viral RNA and viral protein were synthesized, which indicated that the LiCl has inhibited the viral RNA and viral protein synthesized.",

The virus genome is an 8.5 kb, positive-sense single-stranded RNA containing one open reading frame. The virus is antigenically highly variable and There are seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3) that do not crossprotect against each other. 1,2 Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes an economically important and highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, swine, and sheep, 3 which makes this virus is monitored by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Currently, FMD vaccine is the traditional way to protect against the disease, which greatly reduces its occurrence. However, the use of FMD vaccines to protect early infection is limited, because the vaccines take protection effect until after 7 days. 4 Additionally, North America and Western Europe are considered as virus-free regions where the animals are not vaccinated.",
