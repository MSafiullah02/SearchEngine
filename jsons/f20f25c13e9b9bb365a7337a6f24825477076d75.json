Existing studies (Chew & Eysenbach, 2010; Jones & Salathe, 2009; Kim & Kim, 2020; Signorini, Polgreen & Segre, 2010) show that Twitter data can provide useful information for epidemic disease (e.g., H1N1, Ebola), including tracking rapidly evolving public sentiments, measuring public interests and concerns, estimating real-time disease activity and trends, and tracking reported disease levels. However, these studies have limitations with only qualitatively manual coding a very small number of Tweets and require more advanced techniques to improve accuracy and precision. In addition, it remains unknown about public reactions to the COVID online. The vast majority of searched articles about COVID-19 and 2019-nCoV focus on epidemic control, such as the transmissibility of the virus (Chen, 2020) , clinical characteristics of the infected cases (Chen et al., 2020) , and patient screening (Quilty, Clifford, Cmmid nCov, Flasche & Eggo, 2020) . The present study employs our developed Artificial intelligence-based Response and Surveillance System (AIRSS) using tremendous amounts of collected Big Social Media Data to respond and add knowledge to our understandings for the pandemic. AIRSS refers to automatedly and continuously collecting and analyzing large-scale (e.g., billions+) digital textual data in real-time. Responding to the COVID-19, AIRSS is a unique approach that supports immediate machine learning of millions of collected textual data from millions of Twitter users and identifying changes in public responses on the platform. In this study, we use machine learning approach to explore these information and communication patterns and further examine (1) What latent topics related to COVID-19 can we identify from these Tweets? (2) What are the themes of these identified topics? (3) How Twitter users react to the COVID-19 pandemic? And (4) How do these sentiments change over time?",

Since a qualitative approach has challenges analyzing large scale of Twitter data, unsupervised learning derives a probabilistic clustering based on the data itself, allowing us to conduct exploratory analyses of large text data in social science research. We configured topic modelling, an unsupervised machine learning method to generate top latent topic distributions. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA, Blei et al., 2003 ) is a probabilistic model of word counts that analyzes a set of documents. We use LDA to identify patterns, themes and structures of the Tweets texts and examine how these themes are connected to each other. It enables us to efficiently categorize the large bodies of data based on patterns and features. LDA has been used to do sentiment analysis of Tweets related to health (Paul & Dredze, 2014) . Topic modelling has been widely used to gain a descriptive understating of unstructured Twitter big data in social science research (Schwartz et al., 2013) .",

Approximately 19% of the emotions within Tweets under Topic 11 relate to feelings about public's Trust for the health authorities. People's feeling of fear and anger for the impact of COVID-19 (e.g., social distancing, shortage of supply) are also prevalent in most topics. Since the feeling of anticipation dominates all eleven topics, we further ran one-tailed z test and assess if each of the eight emotions is statistically significant different across topics.

These categorized themes reveal that public discussions focus on statistics related to COVID-19 and negative consequences. Discussions around symptoms related contents (e.g., cough, fever, difficulty breathing) or treatment related contents (e.g., vaccine, rest and sleep, drink liquids, WHO, 2020) are not prevalent. It is possible that the public are not using Twitter as a platform for posting symptoms or seeking medical help. Results inform health authorities or public health communities that more treatment related messages can be posted as an education tool for the public on social media.Third, our findings suggest that public discussions and attention focus on the COVID-19 in China, South Korea, Diamond Princess, Japan and the United States prior to March 7 th . In particular, the study shows that early signs in the case of outbreak in New York city are revealed in Twitter messages. Public discussions about the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe regions are not prevalently discussed on Twitter.

Findings inform health authorities that open information about the increasing numbers are not leading to great panic among the public, instead, people are holding trust for the authorities and anticipation for potential solutions. We also find that fear is significantly prevalent in all topics. The results are consistent with another study (Kaila & Prasad, 2020) which find that negative sentiments dominated the Tweets. Our results also suggest that mixed feeling indicated in massive Tweet messages exist, including trust for authorities, anticipation for potential measures and treatments, and feeling of fear. Our result is consistent with the sentiment analysis in a Chinese study (Li, Wang, Xue, Zhao and Zhu) which shows that individuals' psychological conditions are significantly impacted by COVID-19. Our results have implications for health authorities that mental health and psychosocial well-being support is needed during this time (WHO, 2020).There are several limitations in the study. First, we only sample a trending of 19 hashtags as search terms to collect Twitter data. Some new hashtags have become new trending terms for Twitter users to group topics over time. For example, #COVID19 has been widely used after it become the official name for the virus. Second, Twitter users are not representative to the whole population, and only indicate online users' opinions and reactions about COVID-19. Even though, Twitter dataset is a value source for us to understanding the real-time Twitter user-generate contents related to COVID-19 disease activities. Third, non-English Tweets are removed from analysis and results are limited to a particular population. Future studies are recommended to include Italian, Germany and Spanish languages for COVID-19 analysis.",
