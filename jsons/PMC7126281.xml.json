Influenza outbreaks have occurred in large public gatherings such as the 2002 winter Olympics in the USA, 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and the 2009 music festivals in Belgium (Chowell et al., 2012). A large number of Toronto residents got infected during an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Svoboda et al., 2004). In 2010, measles outbreaks of various sizes occurred in a majority of European Union countries (Steffens et al., 2010). Severe outbreaks of infectious diseases do not only have great impacts on social life and healthcare, but they also affect the economy through productivity degradation and high cost of treatment (Hadidjojo and Cheong, 2011). Hence, it is crucial to develop an effective strategy to prevent and control epidemic spreading through the population.",

Vaccination is another strategy which not only protects immunized people, but also indirectly protects their friends by breaking transmission chains and reducing risk of infection (Cornforth et al., 2011). From an economical perspective, mass vaccination (i.e. vaccinating the entire population) is not always feasible because of high cost and limitation of vaccination units (Chen et al., 2008, Restrepo et al., 2006, Schneider et al., 2011). Therefore, an efficient immunization policy is required to minimize immunization costs as well as the number of infected individuals.",

By the end of the twentieth century, a variety of models had been proposed to more accurately represent epidemics dynamic. However, the majority neglect population variability in age, sex, contact rate, individual behavior, spatial patterning, etc. (Hartvigsen et al., 2007, Lewis, 2009, Miller and Hyman, 2007, Reluga, 2010, Ventresca and Aleman, 2013). Therefore, a series of deterministic and stochastic compartmental models has been proposed to capture the heterogeneity in contact patterns (Ferguson et al., 2003, Keeling et al., 1997, Lefevre and Picard, 1989, Meyers, 2006, Yorke et al., 1989). Network epidemic is a recent advancement in epidemiology taking into account heterogeneous social structures of real population (Cai et al., 2014, Lewis, 2009, Meyers, 2006, Ventresca and Aleman, 2013).",

            "text": "Network epidemic studies dynamics of epidemic spreading through contact networks of host populations. A contact network is an undirected graph where nodes represent individuals and edges represent the relationship between pairs of individuals (Salath\u00e9 and Jones, 2010, Youssef and Scoglio, 2011). Due to faster dynamics of epidemics than changes in host populations, a static snapshot of contact networks is commonly considered in the literature (Christley et al., 2005, Eubank et al., 2004, Ferrari et al., 2006, Kitchovitch and Li\u00f2, 2011, Schneider et al., 2012, Youssef and Scoglio, 2011). A great deal of research has been carried out both on network modeling of epidemic spreading (Eubank et al., 2004) and on finding the relations between network structure and epidemic parameters (Ames et al., 2011, Chakrabarti and Faloutsos, 2003, Chakrabarti et al., 2008, Youssef and Scoglio, 2011). The results have provided major insights into the development of new immunization strategies. A large number of immunization algorithms have been proposed based on immunizing hubs (i.e. the nodes with highest degree) in networks (Cohen et al., 2003, Dezs\u0151 and Barab\u00e1si, 2002, Gallos et al., 2007, Gao et al., 2011, G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es et al., 2006, Hu and Tang, 2012, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2002). The community structure of real networks has made it possible to immunize intercommunal individuals who play an important role in infectious propagation among different communities (H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013, Masuda, 2009, Salath\u00e9 and Jones, 2010, Yamada and Yoshida, 2012, Yoshida and Yamada, 2012). There is another group of immunization schemes that attempts to raise the epidemic threshold by reduction of largest eigenvalue of network adjacency matrix (Chakrabarti and Faloutsos, 2003, Chakrabarti et al., 2008, Peng et al., 2010). Recently, several other immunization approaches have been put forward that focus on reducing the size of the largest connected component (i.e. set of vertices that are reachable from each other) of the network of non-immunized nodes in order to reduce worst-case epidemic size (Schneider et al., 2012, Schneider et al., 2011, Shams and Khansari, 2013).",

Since the nodes with higher degree are more likely to spread disease due to their higher connections, vaccinating them reduces the contagion propagation through the population (Ventresca and Aleman, 2013).

The idea behind this algorithm is that immunization of a node reduces the degree of its neighbors. So, vaccination of nodes based on their degree in initial network is not always the most efficient algorithm. Therefore, it is recommended to immunize nodes based on their effective degree which is their degree in the current network of non-immunized nodes during the immunization procedure (Hu and Tang, 2012). This algorithm is also known as highest degree adaptive immunization in the literature (Chen et al., 2008, Schneider et al., 2012, Schneider et al., 2011).",

The basic assumption of these strategies is that an infected node can maximally infect nodes that are in its containing component. In other words, in the case of a single source of infection, epidemic spreading is suppressed within the connected component containing initial seeds of infection and is not transmitted to another component. Hence, the worst-case epidemic size is equal to the size of the largest connected component of the network.",

At each time step, each infected node might infect their susceptible neighbors with probability \u03b1. It has been shown that a susceptible node can be infected with probability of 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b1)Ni where Ni is the number of infected neighbor nodes. Incidentally, an infected node recovers after T time steps where T is the infectivity time of the disease in which an infected individual can infect others.

We use the Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi algorithm to generate Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi network containing 10,000 nodes and 20,000 edges. Scale-free networks are the symbols of real networks following a power-law degree distribution p(k)=k\u2212\u03b3 (Barab\u00e1si, 1999). The scale-free network (SF) is generated by the algorithm disclosed in Cho et al. (2009), Chung and Lu (2002) and Goh et al. (2001) with the setting of 10,000 nodes, 20,000 edges and \u03b3=2.5. Small-World networks (SW) reflect high clustering coefficient and short average path length of real networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). In this paper, we construct a Small-World network by exploiting the Watts\u2013Strogatz algorithm (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) such that network size is 10,000, mean degree is 4 and switching probability is 0.01.

Note that only simulations with a significant final epidemic size (i.e. least 2% of the population) are included in the calculation of the average (Salath\u00e9 and Jones, 2010). As shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n, the variance of epidemic size is mostly less than 1% in each network-immunization-disease interaction. The maximum variance is 6%, which occurs in the case of high infection rate in small-world network (see Fig. 3(f)).Fig. 1Fraction of infected individuals under low infection rate (\u03b1=0.2),S, versus q, fraction of immunized nodes for various vaccination strategies.

Betweenness immunization exhibits the best performance in the Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi network, while, Effective degree immunization (EDI) and degree immunization (DI) are the most effective ones in scale-free networks. However, degree-based immunization algorithms are generally more effective than other algorithms, and are therefore among top-3 algorithms in all networks. On the other hand, other algorithms such as SHCI, which ignore network degree, fail to stop spreading of this type of epidemic. The result highlights the importance of network average degree in the suppression of low infection rate epidemics. The above conclusion is also confirmed by similar trends of algorithms in controlling weak epidemics and lowering the average degree (see Fig. 1, Fig. A.1\n). Another surprising result of a weak epidemic simulation (i.e.  \u03b1=0.2) is that it dies out in small-world networks (see Fig. 1(f)) although its basic reproduction number is greater than one (i.e.  R0>1). The result can be explained through special characteristic of small-world networks (i.e. high modularity and clustering coefficient) where R0 cannot solely determine epidemic dynamics (Saram\u00e4ki and Kaski, 2005). In other words, an epidemic with a low infection rate is commonly confined in the local community of the primary infectious individual (Badham and Stocker, 2010, Saram\u00e4ki and Kaski, 2005). Finally, it should be noted that all immunization algorithms obviously outperform random immunization in AS and scale-free networks with a low-power degree distribution. For instance, Effective-Degree immunization is up to 68% more effective than random immunization in AS network.Fig. A.1Average degree of network \u3008k\u3009 for non-immunized nodes, versus q, fraction of immunized nodes q for various vaccination strategies.",

As depicted in Fig. 2, Eigenvector immunization (EI) offers the worst immunization algorithm in all networks with a performance 60% worse than that of random immunization in Small-World network when immunization coverage is equal to 20%. Unlike the low-infection rate epidemics, their moderate counterparts are widely propagated through non-immunized small-world network (see Fig. 2(f)) such that the whole population becomes infected. However, the majority of immunization algorithms can suppress epidemics by immunizing only 5% of the population. Betweenness immunization is still the most effective approach in the Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi network outperforming the next best algorithm (i.e. SHCI) by up to 11%. Comparing the performance of SHCI in the cases of low and medium infection rates indicates that it is more effective in suppressing the moderate one. For instance, Effective degree immunization (EDI) is highly superior to this scheme in the control of weak epidemics in scale-free network (Fig. 1(e)), while, SHCI exhibits a similar performance concerning medium infection rate (Fig. 2(e)). This increasing in relative performance of SHCI must rely on the fact that as infection rate increases, the contagion is more likely to infect all reachable nodes in the component of initial seed. Therefore, the number of infected individuals becomes equal to the size of the largest connected component of the network when the most severe epidemic occurs.",

SHCI algorithm displays a maximal improvement of 8% in Facebook-like and AS network, 4% in Small-world network, 40% in HEP, and 22% in Scale-Free, compared to the next best algorithm. The desired performance of SHCI justifies the claim that the size of the largest connected component of network is the most important factor in spreading of severe epidemics. This assumption is confirmed by trends of other algorithms. For instance, PageRank immunization offers the second best performance in modular and homogeneous networks such as Small-World since it is highly efficient in fragmenting small-world networks into small components by immunization of nodes connecting different clusters (Fig. A.2\n). Moreover, Degree-based immunization algorithms are quite optimum over heterogeneous networks such as Scale-Free and AS networks, as it easily breaks them down via hub immunization.Fig. A.2Fraction of largest connected component (L), versus q, fraction of immunized nodes q for various vaccination strategies.",

Despite the superiority of degree-based immunization algorithms over most centrality-based schemes has been previously investigated (Hartvigsen et al., 2007), the impact of epidemic severity was not pondered in previous literature. The experimental results indicated that the hypothesis (i.e. The superiority of degree-based immunization algorithms over most centrality-based schemes) is plausible only in the case of weak epidemics. From theoretical points, an epidemic with a low infection rate is not propagated to those nodes far from initial seed since the infection probability at far nodes converges to zero. Therefore, degree-based strategies, reducing local connectivity, are more efficient in cases of low infection rate epidemics. On the opposite side, when infection rate increases, the infection probability will converge to one for all nodes except immunized ones. Consequently, the contagion is propagated through the components unless it meets immunized nodes that isolate the infected component. The result is somewhat consistent with the previous finding in Chen et al. (2008), Schneider et al., 2012, Schneider et al., 2011 and Shams and Khansari (2013) where network fragmentation was considered to be the answer to inoculation challenge. But, the point is that they had evaluated immunization algorithms based on severe epidemics and extended their result to all types of epidemics, whereas, it could not be an accurate assumption in the case of low-infection rate epidemic which are not widespread in the whole component.",

The epidemic threshold or the inverse of largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, indicates whether an infection dies out over time or becomes an epidemic. Comparison of epidemic threshold of small-world network with AS and HEP network clearly indicates why weak epidemics die out in small-world network. Additionally, the higher number of infected individuals in a scale-free network is also justified by its power-law distribution which leads to fast propagation of a contagion through the whole network (Chakrabarti et al., 2008, Dezs\u0151 and Barab\u00e1si, 2002, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2002).",

            "text": "Finally, evaluation of immunization algorithms over various networks has found that degree-based immunization algorithms are more effective in power-law degree distribution networks. The effectiveness of degree-based immunization algorithms over heterogeneous networks relies on the fact that hub immunization easily fragments heterogeneous networks (Dezs\u0151 and Barab\u00e1si, 2002). On the other hand, stochastic hill-climbing algorithm can be efficiently exploited to stop an epidemic in modular networks. Modular networks are networks that contain a number of communities with a high connectivity among the nodes within the same community, but low connectivity between nodes in different modules (Clauset et al., 2004). In these networks, an infection is quickly propagated through the community of initial infection seeds. Then, the border nodes of the community transmit epidemic through the whole networks (Yamada and Yoshida, 2012). Hence, immunization algorithms are required to isolate different communities such that an infection that starts in one community is not permitted to propagate through another one. That is the reason why immunization algorithms, immunizing intercommunal (i.e. border) nodes, are more desirable in modular networks (H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013, Masuda, 2009, Salath\u00e9 and Jones, 2010, Yoshida and Yamada, 2012). As a final point, it should be noted that degree-based immunization algorithms are not able to effectively diminish epidemics in homogeneous networks. The reason is that degree-based immunization algorithms cannot differentiate the nodes\u2019 importance in these networks, and therefore, they behave similar to a random strategy. In homogeneous networks, the most effective strategy varies depending on the structural properties of network and epidemic severity. For instance, betweenness immunization is the favorite over the Erd\u00f6s\u2013Renyi network due to the importance of distance reduction. On the other hand, SHCI outperforms all other algorithms in small-world network because of its high modularity.

The evaluation focused on seven popular vaccination strategies, including degree immunization, betweenness immunization, eigenvector immunization, PageRank immunization, effective degree immunization, stochastic hill-climbing immunization (SHCI) and random immunization (RI), which were applied to mitigate the number of infected individuals in low, medium, and high infection rate epidemics. Our experiment verified that epidemic severity affects performance of the algorithms and that, in general, depends on the ability of algorithms to fragment networks or reduce their density. In other words, any increase in infection rate fades the worth of lowering density, while, it weighs the importance of network fragmentation. Conversely, lowering density is much more essential than network fragmentation in preventing weak epidemics. To put it briefly, degree-based immunization algorithms are the favorite in the case of weak epidemics, whereas, SHCI is more superior in the case of high infection rate epidemics.",

            "text": "The experimental results encourage the hypothesis that the scope of the epidemic spreading is a function of network properties such as density and largest connected component size as well as epidemic parameters (e.g. infection rate). Thus, this calls for new research whereby a combination of the above parameters can be exploited as a new metric to mathematically estimate the efficiency of vaccination strategies. Accordingly, new vaccination strategies can be developed to optimize the new metric. It should also be noted that we conducted our analysis based on the SIR model which is not extended to all epidemics. Hence, it is beneficial to examine the impact of severity of epidemics on immunization algorithms in controlling other epidemic model such as SIS in which infected nodes become susceptible again (i.e. are not immune to subsequent infection) and SEIR where there is a new state called exposed (E) to show infected individuals cannot infect others. Finally, it is worth investigating the performance of immunization algorithms regarding other epidemic parameters such as epidemic duration, extinction probability, timing and number of infected individuals at the peak of the epidemic.",
