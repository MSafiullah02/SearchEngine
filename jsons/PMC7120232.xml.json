This observation suggests that camels are the reservoirs of the virus, which can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with these animals or through consumption of their milk: 1599 cases had been diagnosed by July 2015, with 574 deaths [World Health Organization (WHO)]. Of these patients, 63% are male, with an average age of 48 years (Fig. 34.1). In children, the disease tends to be milder or asymptomatic, with severe cases resulting from a comorbidity.

More than 700 cases have been notified, all in Asia and Northern Africa, with 413 deaths. Most cases are isolated, with some intrafamilial clusters being described. Human-to-human transmission is rare, which reflects the poor ability of the virus to adapt to human respiratory mucosa. The persistence of the circulation of these viruses and the great genetic variability of the influenza A virus make us fear that the avian virus may adapt to humans, which would ease its transmission among the human population, potentially causing a pandemic: this is what happened with the H1N1 influenza A, which had a porcine origin and adapted to humans, creating a pandemic in 2009.",

These viruses can be found in the lower and upper respiratory tract of immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients. Their pathogenic role is not completely clear, because they usually occur at low frequency, have a low viral load, and are related to pathogens whose morbidity is better characterized. Diagnosis requires molecular techniques (real-time PCR), whose inclusion in future research will allow us to better characterize the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of the infections caused by these agents.",
