            "text": "Ricin toxin has been classified as a biological threat agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of its extreme toxicity, the ease by which it can be procured from castor beans, and the absence of any available countermeasures.1 Continued concerns about ricin are underscored by a recent NATO Biomedical Advisory Council report that ranked ricin at the top of its list of agents with weaponization potential.2 Ricin is a \u223c65 kDa heterodimeric glycoprotein consisting of 2 subunits, RTA and RTB, which are joined via a single disulfide bond. RTB (262 amino acid residues), a bivalent lectin that recognizes galactose (Gal) and N\u2010acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc), promotes ricin attachment to membrane bound glycoproteins and glycolipids on mammalian cells. RTB also facilitates transport of ricin from the plasma membrane to the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where RTA is liberated from RTB and translocated into the cytoplasm. RTA (267 amino acid residues) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sarcin/ricin loop of 28S ribosomal RNA, thereby arresting protein synthesis and triggering programmed cell death pathways.3, 4, 5 Because the addition of exogenous lactose inhibits RTB\u2010mediated attachment to host cells, this pathway is referred to as a \u201clactose\u2010sensitive\u201d pathway.6\n",

LSECs are of particular interest in this regard considering their importance in scavenging mannosylated proteins from circulation25, 26 coupled with their central role in promoting the clearance of small immune complexes (SICs) from blood.27, 28\n",

Neither lactose nor mannan alone abrogated the effect of ricin (Fig. 2). However, the combination of lactose and mannan afforded partial protection (\u223c40% viability) against ricin\u2010induced cell death, consistent with ricin internalization into KCs occurring via RTB and the MR. To examine the factors influencing ricin attachment to KCs, freshly isolated cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C and pulsed with FITC\u2010labeled ricin in the absence or presence of a large excess of lactose, mannan, or the combination of lactose and mannan. After which the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Lactose inhibited ricin binding to KCs by \u223c90%, whereas mannan alone affected attachment by just \u223c10% (Supplemental Fig. S2). The combination of lactose and mannan did not significantly inhibit binding of ricin to KCs beyond lactose alone. These results indicate that the vast majority of ricin associates with KCs by virtue of RTB's Gal/GalNAc\u2010specific lectin activity, whereas the MR accounts for just a fraction of ricin binding. However, despite the differences in binding, the 2 pathways apparently contribute equally to ricin uptake, as neither lactose nor mannan alone impacted ricin cytotoxicity on KCs. This apparent disconnect is explained by the fact that RTB\u2010mediated uptake is inefficient, whereas the MR uptake is extremely efficient.6, 63 Thus, even small amounts of ricin bound to the MR can result in productive intoxication and cell death.",

In the absence of either PB10 or SylH3, the KC populations, defined by F4/80+ staining, declined from \u223c23% to <2%, consistent with ricin's capacity to essentially ablate these cells from the liver (Fig. 5 and Supplemental Fig. S4). The loss of KCs in situ was confirmed by IHC analysis with F4/80 antibodies (Fig. 5). By comparison, coadministration of ricin with PB10 resulted in complete protection of KCs from toxin\u2010induced death, as determined by flow cytometry and IHC. Identical results were obtained when ricin was coadministered by SylH3 and delivered to mice by i.v. injection (Supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, individual MAbs against RTA or RTB are able to protect KCs in vivo from the effects of ricin exposure, even though they afforded less than maximal activity ex vivo.
