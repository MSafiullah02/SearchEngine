It is both a result of natural ecological system development, and also an inevitable outcome of human ecological system development within a certain stage, with the objective of identifying the possible improvement space for unban ecological security evaluation from complex system perspective. Based on the brittle structure model and set pair theory, this paper firstly explored the main research methods of urban ecological security theory and its characteristics, then conducted a theory of complex system brittleness to analyze the urban ecological security brittle factors, brittle primitives, and brittle structure. Furthermore, it conducted a model of urban ecological system brittleness correlation entropy together with a set pair analysis method to discuss its brittleness. And finally, an ecological safety evaluation has been presented based on the empirical case in Chengdu City of China. The theoretical and empirical analysis shows that the brittle correlation entropy of natural subsystem in urban ecological security is the biggest one. The risks from natural subsystem collapse can easily trigger the brittleness of the entire urban system. The corresponding maximum brittle fluctuation entropy is from economic subsystem; it has a largest impact on the entropy change of urban ecosystem. The way of reducing the uncertainty of urban ecological risks is to lower difference degree coefficient in the system. Relevant decision makers should consider to reduce the increasing degree of entropy and eliminate the fluctuation of the brittle factors. Thus, the threats or risks of urban ecological system can be within the acceptable range and under control. An integrated system management combing with brittleness characters of natural, economics, and social subsystem is necessary. It is helpful for the ecological security construction.",

            "text": "The global urbanization process has been a concern in recent years, and it is a serious challenge to sustainable development and effective urban governance (Xu et al. 2019) . Ecological security becomes an important research domain internationally, especially urban ecological security. As highly populated eco-systems, cities always have more fragile ecological environments (Gao et al. 2017) . Ecological security is regarded as one of the most important national survival strategies (Zhao et al. 2014) . With the rapid development of China's urbanization process, urban ecosystem has become the important part of ecological security. It is both a result of natural ecological system development, and also an inevitable outcome of human ecological system development within a certain stage. The regional scale provides a reasonable spatial context for exploring the eco-security of mega-cities or metropolitan areas (Xiang et al. 2018) . However, the existing research lacks a comprehensive understanding of the influencing factors for biodiversity at a regional scale, and most of the research methods are focused on the environmental or ecosystem perspective to evaluate the urban security instead of a system aspect. This paper aims to identify the possible improvement space for urban ecological security evaluation, and employ a brittle structure model from complex system perspective. Based on the theoretical and empirical study analysis, it is expected to provide some policy recommendation on the improvement for urban ecological security evaluation and management.",

            "text": "Eco-security is defined as the \"ecologically sustainable development that meets the environmental and ecological needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own environmental and ecological needs\" (Khramtsov 2006; Feng et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018) . Urban ecosystem is an artificial ecosystem regarding people as the center compositing with nature, economy, and society (Ma 1984) . Natural system refers to the necessary basic physical environment for the urban residents living and development; it includes the life and non-life elements like sunlight, air, water, soil, plants, animals, microorganisms, and natural landscape. Economic system mainly involved with human economic activities and the development in primary industry, secondary industry, and tertiary industry, such as production, manufacture, consumption closely related to human activities, the science and technology, communications, finance, trade, transportation, and construction, related to the industries development. For the social system, it mainly refers to the related fields of urban residential cultural life and material life, such as housing, food, health, education, services, culture and law (Ma 1984; Kang 1997; Scerri and James 2010; Mi and Peng 2014) . Detail framework is shown in Fig. 1 . The natural system, economic system, and social system could connect and interact with each other; only when these three forming systems keep in an orderly and stable state, it can be possible the urban ecological system to achieve the sustainable development. The main theory acknowledged by the scholars on ecological security is the PSR (pressure-state-response, PSR) theoretical framework; the basic idea of PSR is compared to the ecosystem; the human activities put the pressure on the system and make the state change in environmental quality and natural resources quantity; the society has to formulate related policies and measures in response to the changes in order to alleviate environmental pressure caused by human beings and realize the normal operation of city ecological system. The other theoretical framework model, such as driving forcestate-response (DSR) model, driving force-press-stateimpact-response (DPSIR) model, and driving forcespressure-state-exposure-response (DPSER) model, are the evolutionary variants based on PSR model (Pang and Wang 2014; Chen and Zhou 2005; Zhu and Fu 2015) . Nathwani et al. (2019) expanded DSR model to DPSIR with five factors of driving force (D), pressure (P), state (S), impact (I), and response (R) and pointed that quantifying the resilience of an ecological system requires a detailed understanding of the vulnerabilities and interactions within a complex web of interconnected social, technological, and economic networks. DPSIR model can help to identify the different roles these factors play in the urban ecological security system.",

The principal idea is that, for the context of specific problems, it needs to analyze the in-paired two collections to find out the characteristics, such as, what is the common features in two collections, how many feature are the opposing ones in the collections, or what is the difference; these are the underpins of the associated degree between the two connections.

Against on the systematic analysis of above two methods, the best choice is to make the safety state of the brittle factors from natural subsystem develops toward to the brittle opposite direction c. Just recall the new coronavirus phenomenon happened in China since December 2019, a natural epidemic diseases diffuse from Wuhan, then to the whole country and across the world, which indicates that the nature ecological security is very brittle and need to enhancement systematically. The best way is trying to integrate all the resources and technologies from social and economics subsystem to lower the risks from nature, a mysterious domination for people sometimes.

The paper analyzed the acceptable risks of urban ecosystem. It firstly analyzed the brittle correlation degree among the subsystems, namely, natural subsystem, economic subsystem, and social subsystem of urban ecological system, then compared the brittle correlation among the three subsystems to identify its internal relationship of identical degree, difference degree, and opposite degree. Finally, it concluded that brittle link entropy of natural subsystem is the biggest one; the Natural subsystem X (N = 10) 2 2/10 6 6/10 2 2/10 Economic subsystem Y (N = 13) 0 0 7 7/13 6 6/13 Social subsystem Z (N = 13) 1 1/13 9 9/13 3 3/13 largest fluctuation entropy is from the economic subsystem. The conducted ecological security system can properly reflect the ecological system states of Chengdu city in China, which is a typical city for sustainability development. Based on above analysis and discussed results, we come up below recommendation for the acceptable risk of urban ecological security management and prevention: Firstly, enhance the management or prevention instrument of natural ecological security to reduce the increase degree of entropy. From the above theoretical exploration, it is found that the brittle correlation of natural subsystem in urban ecological system is the largest one; it is very easy to be triggered and influence the entire ecosystem, the related measurement or policy needs to be regulated. The positive policy, especial for the nature resource protection, could make the brittleness factor of natural subsystem develop into the opposite direction, thus reduce the entropy accordingly, Such as the regulation for forest protection, wildlife protection, food safety, water and energy reservation, etc., all above are easily triggered and influence the urban ecological security, some vivid example are new coronavirus disease happened in China since December 2019, fire disaster in Australia, locust disaster from Africa, etc. People are suffering pain and heavy loss because of their own bad habit or behavior to the nature.",

Evidence indicates that the largest brittle fluctuation is from the economic subsystem, which affects the entire entropy change of the whole system. It causes much function uncertainty throughout the entire urban system. It may accelerate the system crash, or plays a role of resistance. Per the survey results in Table 3 , it is found that the current economic subsystem of the brittle factors are still out of the bad state; thus, in the process of pursuing the urban economic development, it is better to keep the harmony with the natural environment and seek improvement in stability to make each factor operates in optimal state. Such as the economic development goal setting, tax levy, rate adjustment, and international trade policy. all of the above will cause an unstable of as urban ecological health and trigger the brittleness. Therefore, a stable policy platform construction is extremely important. A technological orientation and sustainable green industry introduction policy are welcome now in the world. ",

From the above analysis, it can easily conclude that three subsystems are interacted each other. The weakest one is the nature system, which is out of control of human being in fact. While, we, people, can try to reduce the uncertainty of urban ecological risks by means of lowering the difference degree coefficient in the system. That means we could manage or predict the risks ahead of the brittleness occurrence. This requires the science development and management level improvement, especially an integrated system perspective social management mode is necessary.Overall, urban ecological security problem has becomes a critical research domain in today's societies' ecological security. With the critical problem of ecological security situation occurs, the urban ecological securities are increasingly highlighted. The ecological civilization construction has become the priority in China. The urban ecological security requires the city's environment, and resource conditions can meet the basic requirements of urban sustainable development. A suitable ecological security system is urgently needed; three subsystem of natural, economic, and social must regulate each other, harmonious and unified, and maintain the proper degree of brittleness, and then people can enjoy a safe and comfortable ecological environment.
