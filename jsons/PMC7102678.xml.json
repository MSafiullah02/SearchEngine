            "text": "Influenza is an important national, regional and global public health concern because it causes year-round severe morbidity and mortality [1]. Cases can require hospitalization and require admission to the intensive care unit [2,3]. The unpredictable, continuous and rapid mutational potential of influenza viruses poses a serious threat to global health security with a possibility of pandemics at any time [4]. The zoonotic strains of influenza such as influenza A(H5N1) first detected in humans in 1997 in Hong Kong and then reported widespread globally since 2003, A(H7N9) reported in humans since 2013 in China and A(H9N2) reported for decades to be circulating in poultry and recently reported in humans, are strong evidence of these mutational capabilities; [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Therefore, influenza surveillance is essential to monitor and rapidly detect the circulation of different influenza viruses and the emergence of genetic changes in these viruses in humans and animals [9]. Information from influenza surveillance is also important in order to identify circulating strains to be included in the biannual vaccine strain selection to ascertain the needs for each region globally [10]. Nevertheless, surveillance systems have limitations such as lack of consensus on case definition, non-systematic sampling methods, scarcity of information on the circulating influenza viruses, and inconsistent and delayed reporting of cases [11].",

The platform was established by the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean and launched officially in May 2016.
