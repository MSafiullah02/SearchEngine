Wuhan city is the most densely populated city in central China, with more than 11 million residents. In the 27 cases, most patients were admitted into hospitals with clinical symptoms of fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral lung infiltrates as seen on imaging. All incidents were correlated to the city\u2019s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market which predominantly sells a diversity of fish as well as live animals such as marmots, bats, poultry, and snakes (Lu et al., 2020).

Hence, its formula includes the spatial lag term of the dependent variable, which can be expressed as follows: (2)yit=\u03c1Wyt+xit\u2032\u03b2+ui+\u03b5it,where \u03c1Wyt is the spatial lag of the dependent variable and Wyt=\u2211j=1nwijyit is the contiguity based on the weighted Rook matrix. \u03c1 is the spatial autoregression coefficient.

That is, a confirmed case in a region depends on the contiguous regions. The value of \u03c1 reflects the degree of the spatial dependence (Gelfand, Diggle, Guttorp, & Fuentes, 2010).",

The estimated coefficient of the spatially lagged independent variables (LMr and LMd) in the SLX (spatially-lagged X) model was statistically significant at the %5 level. That is, the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases for provinces in China are spatially correlated. This further suggests that it is necessary to construct spatial panel data models rather than SLMs, which do not consider spatial effects, if our objective is to explore the influencing factors of the rate of confirmed cases and their spatial spillover effects.",
