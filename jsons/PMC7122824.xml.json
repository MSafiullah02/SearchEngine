            "text": "Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology with a protean clinical presentation. Symptoms include a quotidian or double quotidian fever, a peri-febrile cutaneous eruption, polyarthritis and, in severe cases, multiorgan involvement. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-18, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and macrophage colony\u2013stimulating factor are elevated in patients with AOSD and are thought to have a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease.1 High index of clinical suspicion and careful investigation are required to make an early diagnosis so that aggressive treatment can be initiated. There is no single diagnostic test for AOSD; rather, the diagnosis is based on sets of clinical and laboratory criteria. Several sets of classification criteria have been published for AOSD. They have all been developed from retrospective data and classify criteria as major or minor. Table 14.1 compares the most recent Fautrel criteria3 with the widely used original Yamaguchi\u2019s criteria.2\n\n",

The prevalence of RHS in AOSD may be as high as 12%, as \u00adsuggested by Arlet et al.4 The possible triggering factors for RHS include drugs, viruses [Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus], autoimmune disorders [rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus], lymphomas, and leukemias.5 The hallmark of this syndrome is excessive activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with massive hypercytokinemia with high levels of interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. This activation cascade produces an overwhelming inflammatory reaction. RHS can occur at any time during the course of AOSD. Moreover, a simultaneous diagnosis of AOSD and RHS is not uncommon. Flares of AOSD and RHS may be clinically indistinguishable, with the exception of a higher frequency of pleuritis and ARDS in RHS. Biological findings are certainly more sensitive in evoking the diagnosis of RHS during flares of AOSD. Leucopenia or thrombocytopenia is uncommon in AOSD and hence can serve as an alert. Raised serum triglyceride level is considered to be a good marker of the hemophagocytic syndrome,6 but it has not been specifically analyzed in flares of AOSD.\n",

A common pathogenetic link, that is, IL18, a pivotal AOSD cytokine, has been suggested in a recent study. A study of 20 patients, with 21 separate hemophagocytic episodes meeting the International Histiocyte Society criteria, showed that serum IL-18 concentrations were significantly higher in the affected population when compared to healthy controls.9 In addition, investigators observed an imbalance between IL-18 and IL-18-binding peptide (BP is IL18\u2019s natural inhibitor), where concentrations of IL-18BP were insufficient to bind the entire amount of circulating IL-18. A paradoxical decrease of natural killer (NK) cell numbers and cytotoxic functions in secondary RHS was also observed. Based on this study, the authors proposed the potential use of exogenous recombinant IL-18BP, in addition to traditional therapy, for the treatment of severe cases of RHS.",

            "text": "The evolution of AOSD from the acute syndrome, where often systemic complaints such as fever and rash predominate, into the chronic articular pattern is a negative prognostic sign. There is less of a chance for spontaneous remission, and the associated polyarthritis can be destructive if left untreated and lead to increased morbidity and disability. Fortunately, in most cases of AOSD, polyarthritis methotrexate (MTX), with or without small doses of oral corticosteroids, can be very effective in controlling the symptoms and preventing radiographic progression.10 However, MTX refractoriness has been frequently documented and alternative therapies have been sought. In the prebiologic era, alternative DMARDs were tried, alone or in combination. In a small series where cyclosporin-A was tried, remission in 66% of cases and improvement in the other 33% were reported.11 Sulfasalazine should be avoided in treatment of AOSD as multiple studies proved low efficacy and high drug toxicity (60% vs. 15% of other drugs) related to treatment with sulfasalazine.12 CD34-selected autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was attempted in some cases of refractory disease and prolonged remission was achieved after transplantation.13 Other less studied agents include hydrochloroquine, gold, penicillamin, leflunomide, azathioprine, tacrolimus, and cyclophosphamide. Recent advances in the immunopathogenesis of AOSD and the availability of biologic DMARDs for the treatment of RA has led to their off-label use in refractory AOSD with variable success. In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 were targeted.",

Systemic use of steroids remains controversial. Lietman and Bywaters20 in their series of patients with pericarditis did not demonstrate efficacy of steroids in altering the course of pericarditis. However, steroids may be useful in the presence of massive effusion, evidence of cardiac compromise, or progression of effusions not responding to NSAIDs.

Recently, Chen et al. described high levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in patients with active untreated AOSD and proposed that elevated serum sICAM-1 level may be a predictor of liver dysfunction in AOSD.

A hypothesis by Elkon in 1982 that a smoldering vasculitis, mediated by non-necrotizing immune complexes, may support the hypothesis that GN is part of the disease. The possibility of a more active renal process can be supported by the significant decrease in proteinuria after anti-inflammatory treatment. In general, aggressive immunosuppression is recommended in patients with proliferative forms of GN, with a high histological score for active lesions and a low score for chronic lesions.
