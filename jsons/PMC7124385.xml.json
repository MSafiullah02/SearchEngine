MERS viruses broke out in one hospital in Pyeongtaek, South Korea (hereinafter Korea), on May 2015, 2015. Thirty-six patients died and 186 people were infected.1 The Koreans experienced a national crisis, contributed to by the poor initial response of the affected hospitals, an inadequate response from the government, the economic depression that followed the outbreak, and the psychological impact of the outbreak on the Korean population. To date, the Korean government has not taken systematic actions to deal with global pandemics in the future.",

We define the Korean reaction (which includes four major stakeholders) as a hospital infection control issue (Figure 1\n). The four stakeholders were either directly or indirectly involved in the outbreak of MERS in Korea. We argue that the nation has to transform its current reaction into an emergency management issue involving all stakeholders.",

Many schools temporarily cancelled classes, although unnecessarily, so that their students could stay at home.
