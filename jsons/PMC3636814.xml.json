However, recently, the endocytic network has also been demonstrated to contain an alternative secretory pathway (6). Pan and Johnstone were the first to describe this pathway in reticulocytes 7, 8. Subsequent to its discovery in reticulocytes, it has been shown to be present in many cell types including B lymphocytes (9), dendritic cells (DCs) (10), platelets (11), epithelial cells (12) and neurons (13). The studies in reticulocytes demonstrated that this alternative secretory pathway involves the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane and extracellular release of the material present within the ILVs. The MVB is an intermediate but a well\u2010defined compartment that is formed from endosomes by invagination of the limiting endosomal membrane.",

The process has to be well co\u2010ordinated as it dictates the composition and the fate of ILVs. Only recently have certain mechanisms for protein sorting to MVBs been elucidated and include (i) ubiquitination of the target and (ii) preferential aggregation. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae experimental system, it has been shown that monoubiquitination of endosomal proteins serves as a signal for sorting to MVBs (15). Some studies have also suggested that oligoubiquitination may also be a sorting signal for trafficking to MVBs, which may increase MVB sorting efficiency (16). A key player in MVB biogenesis is the hetero\u2010oligomeric protein complex, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). ESCRT\u2010I, \u2010II and \u2010III recognize monoubiquitinated cargoes and promote their inclusion in MVBs (14). Once completed, the ESCRT complex dissociates from the MVB membrane aided by the adenosine triphosphatase vacuolar protein sorting 4 (Vps4) and is recycled for subsequent cargo (17). As summarized in Figure 1, hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) binds ubiquitinated cargo while simultaneously recruiting the ESCRT family of proteins and mobilizes the cargo for inclusion into MVBs.",

These proteins, which lack the sorting signal for ubiquitination, are partitioned into the ILVs based on their intrinsic physical properties and preference to segregate into raft\u2010like microdomains (18). Molecular aggregation of transferrin receptor in reticulocytes reroutes the receptor from the recycling compartment to the MVB (19). Studies by Geminard et al. indicate that the transferrin receptor can interact with the ESCRT machinery despite the lack of ubiquitination (20). Additional studies have demonstrated that protein aggregation induced by antibodies led to the defective sorting of antigens to MVBs (19). Thus, protein clustering appears to be a major determinant in protein trafficking to the MVB. Recent studies by Theos et al. demonstrated a trafficking of melanosomal protein Pmel17 to MVBs in an ubiquitin\u2010 and ESCRT\u2010independent manner (21). In summary, not all cargoes are recruited to MVBs by the same mechanism, and there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how different cargoes are targeted to ILVs and how the ILV formation occurs.",

Exosome composition varies depending on the cell type of origin. Nevertheless, exosomes contain a number of common protein components (26). As shown in Figure 2, the cytosolic proteins present on exosomes include Rabs, which promote exosome docking and the membrane fusion events (27). The annexins, including annexin I, II, V and VI, may regulate membrane cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane fusion events (28). Several adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101, CD146, CD9, milk\u2010fat\u2010globule EGF\u2010factor VIII (MFG\u2010E8), CD18, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD166 and LFA\u20103/CD58 have also been identified in exosomal preparations 26, 27. In addition, several proteins involved in apoptosis are present on exosomes including thioredoxin peroxidase II, Alix, 14\u20103\u20103 and galectin 3. Exosomes also contain heat\u2010shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, which can facilitate peptide loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC)I and MHCII (29). One of the characteristic features of exosomes is the tetraspanins, which include CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82. Exosomes also carry some cell\u2010specific proteins like MHCII and CD86 present only on exosomes isolated from antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs) (30) and MFG\u2010E8/lactadherin present on exosomes from immature DCs (31). Exosomes are also enriched in proteins that participate in vesicle formation and trafficking like the lyso\u2010bisphosphatidic acid (LBPA)\u2010binding protein Alix (28). Other proteins detected on exosomes are the metabolic enzymes such as peroxidases, pyruvate and lipid kinases and enolase\u20101 (32).

The typical lipid composition of mast cell\u2010derived exosomes includes lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol and diglyceride (34). Although most of these lipids are also present on exosomes isolated from other cell types, and the ratios of these lipids vary. For instance, the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio is higher in B\u2010cell\u2010derived exosomes compared with exosomes from mast cells and reticulocytes (36). Phospholipids like LBPA accumulate in MVBs and appear to play a key role in ILV formation (37). Recent studies by de Gassart et al. have demonstrated the presence of lipid rafts on the exosomes (18). These low\u2010density, Triton\u2010insoluble fractions are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and contain different acylated proteins such as glycosyl\u2010phosphatidylinositol\u2010anchored proteins and tyrosine kinases of the Src family (38).",

Johnstone et al. showed that sheep red blood cells lose their transferrin receptor during in vivo and in vitro maturation by exosome release (39). The transferrin receptor is tightly associated with Hsp70 on exosomes, and the heat\u2010shock protein may play a role in exosome release from reticulocytes. How soluble proteins that lack a signal sequence are released from cells has been the focus of considerable research, and some mechanisms have recently been defined. One method is through association with exosomes, as observed for the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), a cytoplasmic protein that facilitates an inflammatory response by stimulating histamine release. Tumor suppressor activated pathway 6 (TSAP6), a p53\u2010inducible 5\u20136 transmembrane protein, has been reported to associate with exosomes as well as with cytoplasmic TCTP, thus facilitating the release of TCTP through exosomes (40). A more recent study by Yu et al. demonstrated that exosomes function in the release of some p53\u2010regulated extracellular proteins and that this effect stems from the upregulation of TSAP6 expression by p53 (41). Another function attributed to exosomes includes the constitutive extracellular release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (42). This established a new mechanism for release of soluble cytokine receptors, which could compete for ligand binding. The cytokine interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2 and possibly the chemokine regulated activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) may also be secreted by exosomes (43). Other studies have defined a role for exosomes in ectodomain shedding and consequently a vehicle for the cellular export of soluble molecules like L1 (CD171) and CD44 in ovarian carcinoma cells (44). A study by Azevedo et al. showed that in sepsis, nitric oxide and bacterial elements are responsible for type\u2010specific platelet\u2010derived exosome generation (45). These exosomes play an active role in vascular signaling as redox active particles, which induced endothelial cell caspase\u20103 activation and apoptosis of vascular cells (46).",

Their studies were the first to document the release of intact MHCII on the exosomes secreted by both human and murine B\u2010cell lines. Subsequent studies have shown that exosomes produced by mouse DCs pulsed with tumor peptides induced the rejection of established tumors in a T\u2010cell\u2010dependent fashion (10). Exosomes can also transfer antigens from tumor cells to DCs (47) and therefore functions in antigen cross\u2010presentation. Like DC\u2010derived exosomes, exosomes from tumor cells carry MHC molecules along with tumor antigens like melan\u2010A/MART1 (melanoma tumor), which can be recognized by T cells (27). Together, the data implicate that exosomes can function in presenting tumor antigens to sensitized T cells and can promote tumor rejection in vivo \n10, 43. A number of excellent reviews are available on exosomes role in tumor immunity 48, 49, 50.

Studies with retroviruses have revealed the ability of viruses to hijack the intracellular machinery of MVBs for their budding at the cell surface (64). HIV utilizes MVBs as the major site for accumulation in human macrophages 25, 63, and the viruses released have markers commonly found on exosomes. However, although the HIV particles and exosome contain similar components, they may have different origins (5).

It is now apparent that innate effector mechanisms are initiated through specific detection of microbial patterns, which facilitate an immune response. These microbial signatures are referred to as pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and are specifically recognized by the host\u2019s pattern recognition receptors (67). Therefore, PAMPs expressed on the surface or released by the pathogen play an essential role in stimulating immunity. By their nature, intracellular pathogens show a more limited exposure to the immune system compared with extracellular pathogens, and this includes limited exposure of PAMPs. We and others hypothesized that release of exosomes from infected cells may be one mechanism by which this sequestration of PAMPs can be overcome.",

Density gradient electrophoresis analysis of the infected cells also suggested that released mycobacterial lipids coalesce in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, including MVBs (68). Studies directed toward the trafficking of Mycobacterium avium glycopeptidolipids (GPL) also indicated a similar release and trafficking of the GPL inside the macrophages (69). Moreover, these studies indicated that the mycobacterial PAMPs were not confined to the infected cells but were also trafficked to the neighboring bystander cells 68, 69, 70, 71.

Nevertheless, the true generality of this mechanism for extracellular release of PAMPs from cells infected with intracellular pathogens remains to be determined, as is the effect these exosomes have on the immune response.",

            "text": "The use of exosomes has garnered considerable interest as vaccine candidates for tumor immunotherapy (79). Much of this interest stems from the difficulty associated with DC\u2010based immunotherapy and how an exosome\u2010based approach can overcome some of these difficulties. Tumor cell\u2010derived exosomes containing tumor antigens plus MHC class I molecules can transfer tumor antigens to DCs to induce a CD8+ T\u2010cell dependent anti\u2010tumor immune response (80). Exosomes released from DCs pulsed with tumor antigens were also shown to elicit strong anti\u2010tumor responses. Data obtained in mice have shown that exosomes obtained from DCs pulsed with tumor peptides could prime specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vivo and limit or suppress growth of established murine tumors in a T\u2010cell\u2010dependent manner 10, 81. Interestingly, tumor\u2010derived exosomes may have broader activity than previously believed as one study showed that exosomes isolated from different tumors inhibited not only syngeneic but also allogenic tumor growth, indicating that tumor\u2010derived exosomes may harbor some common tumor antigens (47). Together, these studies indicate that exosomes can be isolated from tumor cells or from DCs pulsed with tumor antigens to deliver a target immunogen capable of inducing an effective immune response and that they may represent a new cell\u2010free vaccine. Some phase I clinical trials have been completed, and although problems with their use remain, the data suggest that exosome\u2010based therapy is a viable approach (82).",

            "text": "The successful use of exosomes in cancer immunotherapy has lead to the hypothesis that they could function as vaccine candidates in the context of infectious diseases. Aline et al. demonstrated that exosomes derived from DCs pulsed with T. gondii tachyzoite sonicates could induce a protective immune response against T. gondii infection. These exosomes primed an antigen\u2010specific cellular and humoral immune response, which provided a good protection against both acute and chronic toxoplasmosis (83). Moreover, CBA/J mice vaccinated with exosomes isolated from T. gondii antigen\u2010pulsed DCs exhibited significantly fewer brain cyst (84). Another application of exosomes in immunotherapy has been implicated in the treatment of pneumococcal infection in mice (85). Colino and Snapper showed that murine bone marrow\u2010derived DCs (BMDCs) pulsed in vitro with intact diphtheria toxin (DT)\u2010released exosomes, which upon injection into mice induce immunoglobulin G (IgG)2b and IgG2a responses specific for DT (86). Exosomes have also been evaluated in the context of Streptococcus infections. Invasive strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae are leading causes of meningitis and major causes of otitis media and bacteremia in children and pneumonia in the elderly (87). Vaccine\u2010mediated protection against S. pneumoniae infection is based on humoral immunity specific for S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (Cps) (88). Similar to the DT exosomes, BMDCs treated with Cps14 released exosomes enriched in Cps14. These purified exosomes could induce a S. pneumoniae\u2010protective Cps14\u2010specific immunoglobulin M and IgG3 response in naive recipients (85). Exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG\u2010infected macrophages could stimulate splenic T cells isolated from BCG\u2010infected mice (J. S. S., unpublished data), but whether these exosomes can function as vaccine candidates awaits further study. Exosomes as a vaccine has also been explored for atypical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the positive\u2010stranded RNA virus, SARS\u2010associated cornavirus (SARS\u2010CoV). Studies by Kuate et al. showed that exosomes containing spike S protein of SARS\u2010CoV induced neutralizing antibody titres (89). This immune response was further accentuated by priming with the SARS\u2010S exosomal vaccine and then boosting with the currently used adenoviral vector vaccine (89).",

For instance, Pisitkun et al. demonstrated the excretion of exosomes containing aquaporin\u20102 protein in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus patients (73). Similar proteomic studies performed on urinary exosomes generated a long list of molecular signatures, illustrating valuable potential for diagnostic, prognostic and pathophysiological discovery (92). Similar to reno pathologies, exosomes are also an attractive biomarker candidate for cancer diagnosis with most of the focus centered on bladder cancer. The differentially expressed proteins include psoriasin, kertain\u201014, galectin\u20107, epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E\u2010FABP), migration inhibitor factor\u2010related protein (MRP8) and 14 and stratifin, which may be useful markers for the diagnosis of bladder cancer (91). Exosomes may also be valuable as biomarkers for infectious diseases, mainly in the context of defining treatment success. Unfortunately, to date, this has not been tested. Exosomes may be particularly useful in the context of tuberculosis (TB) as the time required to test a new TB drug treatment protocol is extensive, leading to high drug development cost as well as delays in the introduction of new medication. A major limitation in developing an efficient drug treatment for TB is the lack of available methodology to identify an early infection as well as determine drug treatment efficacy. Currently, a major goal is to identify disease biomarkers in biological fluids that can be measured relatively inexpensively for early diagnosis of disease and treatment success. We hypothesize that exosomes, whose composition may change during the course of an M. tb infection and treatment, may be such a biomarker.",

Nevertheless, there are still many unanswered questions including (i) how is fusion of a MVB with the plasma membrane and release of exosomes regulated, (ii) under what circumstances do exosomes function in vivo, and what are the consequences of their expression and (iii) how can we modify exosome composition to maximize their efficacy as vaccines or therapeutic agents.
