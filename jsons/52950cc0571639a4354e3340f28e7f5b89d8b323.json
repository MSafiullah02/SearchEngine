It is commonly accepted that the success of natural products as a prolific source of lead structures is due to metabolome evolution of macro-and microorganisms, which resulted in the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds as a response toward antagonistic environmental conditions. Historically, most of the currently used anti-infectives of natural origin were derived from soil-dwelling microorganisms, such as fungi and actinomycetes, and in limited cases from terrestrial plants (antimalarial agents) [2, 3] . A few notable examples include the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic penicillin G from the fungus Penicillium notatum, the macrolide erythromycin from the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora erythraea, and the antimalarial compound artemisinin from the plant Artemisia annua [4] . Most of these agents were introduced between the 1940s and 1960s, during the so-called 'golden era' of antibiotic discovery; however, the development of novel antibiotics dramatically dropped over the past several decades, partially based on the misleading notion that the battle against microbial infections has been won. Moreover, in recent years, the emerging microbial drug resistance against many clinically used anti-infective drugs has jeopardized their treatment efficacy. In particular, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.), Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida sp., Plasmodium falciparum, or HIV, among others, have become a global threat [5] . This antibiotic resistance crisis may lead to extremely severe public health consequences unless adequate global responses, including development of new antimicrobials, are achieved [6] . Thus, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents from nature, preferably with new mechanisms of action, higher selectivity, and less sensitivity to drug-resistance development, remains an important investigation area of natural products research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 253, "end": 256, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 765, "end": 768, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 769, "end": 771, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1887, "end": 1890, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2078, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Marine-derived natural products occupy a special place in delivering new drugs into the pharmaceutical market, as a rich source of numerous novel chemical entities with pronounced biological activities [7] . This is exemplified by the fact that in the last two decades the number of FDA-/EMA-approved marine drugs (ziconotide, 2004; omega-3-acid-ethyl esters, 2004; eribulin mesylate, 2010; brentuximab vedotin, 2011; and trabectedin, 2015) substantially increased since the discovery of the unusual nucleosides spongothymidine and spongouridine from the sponge Tethya crypta, leading to the first marine drugs ara-A (vidarabine) and ara-C (cytarabine) by the late 1950s [8, 9] (Fig. 3.1) . Literature data have shown that the majority of these metabolites, including those entering clinical trials, are mainly being developed in the areas of analgesia and cancer [10] .

Twenty-four-membered macrolactins are frequently produced by Bacillus strains and possess antibacterial, anticancer, and antiviral activities. The culture broth of bacterium Bacillus sp. 09ID194, isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from Ieodo in Korea's southern reef, was found to produce three macrolides including macrolactins A, Q, and W. Macrolactin W (1) showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Bacillus subtilis (KCTC 1021), Staphylococcus aureus (KCTC 1916) , Escherichia coli (KCTC 1923) , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (KCTC 2592) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value \u00bc 64 \u03bcg/ml in the serial dilution assay. However, no cytotoxic activity was recorded for 1 against different cancer cell lines, emphasizing its importance as a selective antibacterial drug candidate [12] . [13] . These macrolides feature an oxetane ring in 2, an epoxide moiety in 3, and a tetrahydropyran ring in 4. The configurations of 2\u00c04 were assigned by calculating the coupling constants, through analysis of ROESY spectra, and by performing the modified Mosher's method. Compounds 2\u00c04 exhibited MICs of 0.06-0.07 \u03bcg/ml, against B. subtilis (KCTC 1021) and E. coli (KCTC 1923) , and 0.009-0.07 \u03bcg/ml against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (KCTC 7913) in the broth dilution assay. The presence of an oxygen at C-15 was mandatory for the antibacterial activity [13] . Further macrolactin analogues were obtained from the culture broth of B. subtilis strain 109GGC020 isolated from a marine sediment sample obtained from Gageocho, in Korea's southern reef. The new compounds gageomacrolactins (5-7) and the known macrolactins A (8), B (9), F (10), and W (1) exhibited significant broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities. Compounds 5-7 revealed antibacterial activities against Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella typhi, and P. aeruginosa) bacteria with MIC values in the range of 0.008-0.03 \u03bcg/ml vs. azithromycin (positive control, MIC 0.008 \u03bcg/ml). All isolated compounds inhibited also the mycelial growth of the fungi Aspergillus niger, S. cerevisiae, Candida acutatum, and Candida albicans with MIC values ranging from 0.016 to 0.204 \u03bcg/ml vs. amphotericin B (positive control, MIC 0.018 \u03bcg/ml). Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that the hydroxyl function at C-15 of the macrolactone moiety is essential for antimicrobial activity. These results emphasize the impact of macrolactins as potential antibacterial/fungicidal drugs [14] . Proteobacteria that are derived from the marine environment are prolific producers of many new and bioactive metabolites. The crude extract of Pseudoalteromonas sp. CMMED 290, associated with a nudibranch collected in shallow waters of Kaneohe Bay, Oahu (Hawaii), displayed significant broadspectrum antibiotic activity against S. aureus (ATCC 25923), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300), and E. coli (ATCC 25922). Chromatographic workup afforded compounds 11 and 12, which showed potent antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with MIC values in the low \u03bcM range [15] . 2,3,5,7-Tetrabromobenzofuro[3,2-b]pyrrole (11) exhibited activity against MRSA (MIC 0.90 \u03bcg/ml). The mechanism of antimicrobial activity of this compound was suggested to be due to its ability to disrupt the bacterial cell wall membrane, whereas human erythrocytes were not lysed when the compound was applied at the same dose [15] . 2,3,5,7-Tetrabromobenzofuro[3,2-b]pyrrole (11) 4,4',6-Tribromo-2,2'-biphenol (12) MRSA-caused infections are challenging problems in both community and hospital settings. An extract of the strain Streptomyces sp. CNS-575, isolated from a marine sediment sample collected at ca. 0.5 m depth from Nasese shoreline, Viti Levu, Fiji, exhibited potent antibiotic activity against MRSA. Chromatographic workup afforded fijimycins A-C (13) (14) (15) , in addition to etamycin A (16) . The antibacterial activities of these metabolites were assessed against three MRSA strains, the hospital-associated strain (ATCC33591), the sequenced hospitalassociated strain (Sanger 252), and the community-associated strain (UAMS1182). Fijimycins A (13), C (15) and etamycin A (16) exhibited strong to medium antibiotic activities against the three MRSA strains with MIC values ranging from 4-32 \u03bcg/ml. The weak activity of fijimycin B (14) against both ATCC33591 and UAMS1182 indicated that the \u03b1-phenylsarcosine unit is essential for antibacterial activity. The similar antimicrobial activities of the stereoisomers fijimycin A (13) and etamycin A (16) suggest that substituting D-for L-\u03b1-phenylsarcosine has only negligible effects with regard to the anti-MRSA activities [16] . Streptomyces sp. 7-145 was isolated from a marine sediment sample obtained from Heishijiao Bay, Dalian, People's Republic of China (P.R. China). Wu et al. selected this strain for further investigation based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, targeted for strains that may produce glycosylated antibiotics. Investigation of the culture broth of the studied Streptomyces sp. afforded two new elaiophylins-6-deoxyglycoside derivatives along with four known ones [17] . Among the purified compounds, 11 0 ,12 0 -dehydroelaiophylin (17) , elaiophylin, 11-Omethylelaiophylin, and efomycin G (18) (19) (20) were the most potent ones against different MRSA strains and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with MIC values ranging from 1 to 4 \u03bcg/ml [17] . In addition, 18 and 20 were also active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with MICs ranging from 2 to 16 \u03bcg/ml [17] . No cross-resistance was observed between 17 and 20 and erythromycin or azithromycin (14-and 15-membered macrolides) confirming that the activity of elaiophylins (16-membered lactone) is not affected by the macrolide resistance mechanism in Gram-positive bacteria. SAR studies revealed that the hemiketal moiety at 11 and 11 0 positions is important for the antibacterial activity, whereas substitution of the 14 0 ethyl group with a methyl group reduces the activity, thereby proving the essential role of the alkyl group at positions C-14 or C-14 0 . Chemical investigation of a marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0244) derived from a sediment sample collected off South Molle Island, Queensland, Australia, led to the isolation of a first-in-class glyco-hexadepsipeptide-polyketide mollemycin A (21) [18] . Mollemycin A (21) showed pronounced activity against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus (strains ATCC 25293 and ATCC 9144), S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, and B. subtilis (strains ATCC 6051 and ATCC 6633), as well as against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with IC 50 values ranging from 13 to 65 ng/ml. Moreover, compound 21 was exceptionally potent against drug-sensitive 3D7 and multidrug-resistant Dd2 clones of the Malaria parasite P. falciparum with IC 50 values of 12 and 9 ng/ml, respectively, whereas it exhibited at least 20-fold lower cytotoxicity toward human neonatal foreskin fibroblast cells, verifying this compound as a potential lead antimalarial agent for further investigation [18] . Bioassay-guided fractionation of the EtOAc extract of Streptomyces sp. CNH365, isolated from a sediment sample collected off Gaviota State Beach, California, USA, yielded a structurally unique 14-membered macrolide, termed anthracimycin (22) . Compound 22 exhibited potent activity against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, as well as methicillin-and vancomycin-resistant strains of S. aureus with MIC values less than 0.25 \u03bcg/ml [19, 20] . Moreover, 22 showed marked effects on the growth rate of MRSA even at sub-MIC concentrations (1/16 MIC; 0.0078 \u03bcg/ml), compared to the antibacterial agent vancomycin. Notably, 22 exhibited low mammalian cell cytotoxicity with an IC 50 value of 70 \u03bcg/ml and was shown to exert synergistic effects with the human cathelicidin LL-37 on MRSA growth. Further investigation employing an optimized macromolecular synthesis assay indicated disruption of nucleic acid synthesis from 22 at concentrations near the MIC, thus suggesting that this effect might be related to its mode of action. Following these intriguing results, a murine peritonitis model of infection was employed to ascertain in vivo efficacy of 22. Interestingly, anthracimycin (22) at a single i.p. injection dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg, even one hour after MRSA infection, provided sufficient protection against mortality and was well tolerated by mice, thus suggesting its potential as a novel lead scaffold against MRSA [19] . [21] . Interestingly, compounds 23 and 24 are the first natural rifamycins to bear a 3-amino group. Moreover, the structures of compounds 25 and 26 feature an unprecedented heterocyclic core connected with a 14-membered ansa bridge, thus forming a novel ansa macrolide template. All isolated compounds (23) (24) (25) (26) , together with two reference compounds 27-demethoxy-27-hydroxyrifamycin S (27) and rifamycin S (28), both lacking the 3-amino substituent, were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against MRSA, E. coli, and M. tuberculosis. Among the isolated compounds, rifamycins 23 and 24 displayed exceptional antibacterial activity (MIC 90 values ranging from 0.07 to 0.63 ng/ml), which was higher than that of the reference compounds 27 and 28 (up to 700-fold). Moreover, sporalactam B (26) showed selective activity against M. tuberculosis, both in broth and in macrophages, with MIC 90 values of 44 ng/ml and 2.2-6.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, comparable to those of 27. These data implied that the 3-amino substituent as well as 27-O-methylation plays an important role in the antimicrobial potency of these metabolites, probably by favoring their binding to RNA polymerase [21] . Azaphilones are produced by several fungal genera including Aspergillus, Monascus, and Penicillium. Six unprecedented azaphilones, comazaphilones A-F, were obtained from extracts of Penicillium commune QSD-17, a fungus derived from a marine sediment sample obtained at 210 m depth from the Southern China Sea [24] . Comazaphilone C (36) was shown to be active against MRSA, P. fluorescens, and B. subtilis with MIC values of 16, 64, and 32 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Comazaphilone D (37) was active only against MRSA and P. fluorescens with MIC values of 32 and 16 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, while comazaphilone E (38) was active against P. fluorescens and B. subtilis with MIC values of 32 and 16 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The MIC values of the positive control, ampicillin, ranged from 4 to 8 \u03bcg/ml. SAR studies showed that the position of the double bond at C-10 and of the orsellinic acid moiety at C-6 in the azaphilone core structure affects the antibacterial activity of the respective compounds. Infections by pathogenic bacteria are often due to the formation of microbial biofilms. Medical devices are often contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms which are involved in the transmission of infections. Scopel et al. succeeded in isolating the dipeptide cis-cyclo (Leucyl-Tyrosyl) (39) from culture broth of Penicillium sp. F37, a fungal strain obtained from the sponge Axinella corrugata collected in South Brazil. Cis-cyclo (Leucyl-Tyrosyl) (39) selectively inhibits up to 85% of biofilm formation, thus pointing to 39 as a promising broad-spectrum drug candidate [25] . With the purpose to identify novel antibiotics from microbial sources, a series of naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones were isolated from the fungus Aspergillus sp. Z120 that was obtained from the Marine Culture Collection of China [27] . Among them, the asperpyrone-type metabolites fonsecinones A (45) and C (46), formed via a C-10 0 -C-9 linkage, displayed significant antibacterial activity toward extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli (MIC \u00bc 4.3 \u03bcg/ml), followed by the dimeric naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones aurasperones A (47) and E (48) with C-10 0 -C-7 linkages (MIC \u00bc 8.5 \u03bcg/ml), equipotent to the inhibitory effects of the positive controls amikacin and ceftriaxone, respectively. Subsequent molecular docking-based target identification studies were employed revealing the bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI), a key enzyme in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis, as a possible antibacterial target for compounds [45] [46] [47] [48] . To further confirm these results, all compounds were subjected to a FabI inhibition assay and were shown to inhibit FabI in a concentration-dependent manner, thus indicating that this effect is likely related to the mode of action of these metabolites [27] . Diketopiperazines (DKPs) are widespread in nature and show diverse biological activities, such as disruption of biofilm formation [28] . Aspergillus versicolor MF030 was isolated from the Bohai Sea sediment (P.R. China). Fermentation of the strain yielded brevianamide S (49), a rare natural dimeric DKP having antitubercular activity, and three monomeric DKPs brevianamides T, U, and V, along with the known brevianamides N and K and deoxybrevianamide E. Among the isolated metabolites, 49 exhibited antibacterial activity against bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) with a MIC value of 6.25 \u03bcg/ml, versus the positive control isoniazid (MIC, 0.05 \u03bcg/ml). In spite of the moderate effect of 49, its selectivity toward BCG makes brevianamide S a potential new drug candidate as a next-generation antibiotic for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [29] . The fungus Nigrospora sp. isolated from fresh tissue of an unidentified sea anemone, collected from the Weizhou coral reef in the South China Sea (P.R. China), afforded two new hydroanthraquinone derivatives 4a-epi-9 \u03b1-methoxy-dihydrodeoxybostrycin and 10-deoxybostrycin together with seven known anthraquinones nigrosporin B, \u03b1-hydroxydihydrodesoxybostrycin, \u03b1-hydroxyhalorosellinia A, bostrycin, 4-deoxybostrycin, 3,5,8-trihydroxy-7methoxy-2-methylanthracene-9,10-dione, and austrocortirubin as well as ten further acetylated derivatives. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against different bacterial strains. 10-Deoxybostrycin (50) A structurally unprecedented alkaloid, curvulamine (53) , was reported from the fungus Curvularia sp. IFB-Z10, isolated from the fish Pennahia argentata [31] . Isotope-feeding and enzyme inhibition studies suggested that the unique carbon framework of 53 is derived from two unprecedented oligoketide extender units that are formed via decarboxylative condensation between a tetraketide acyl-CoA substrate and the amino acid alanine. Notably, curvulamine (53) exhibited potent antibacterial activity toward a panel of patient-derived pathogens, including Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., and Bacteroides vulgatus with MIC values of 0.12 \u03bcg/ml, being more active than the antimicrobial agent tinidazole, which was used as a positive control (MICs, 0.12-0.5 \u03bcg/ml). Likewise, 54 showed activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MICs of 1.9 \u03bcg/ml. In addition, spiromastixones G (55), J (58), K (59), and L (60) showed pronounced antibacterial effects against the Gram-positive strains S. aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and B. subtilis with MIC values less than 2 \u03bcg/ml, comparable to those of the positive control penicillin G. However, all compounds were found to be inactive against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli (MIC > 128 \u03bcg/ml), suggesting their selective antibacterial action. Moreover, comparison of the antibacterial properties of the isolated spiromastixones revealed that increase of chlorine substitution as well as O-methylation in ring C are essential structural features for the antibacterial activity of these compounds [32] .

The spermine nucleus in 74 and 75 is essential for the antibiotic activity against P. aeruginosa [40] . These results suggested that the 3,5-dibromophenol substitution of 79 plays an important role in mediating antimicrobial activity, and thus this metabolite represents a potential lead scaffold for drug development against MRSA-and K. pneumoniae-associated infections, which are difficult to treat with currently available antibiotics [43] . A unique class of proline-rich peptides, callyaerins A-M, were obtained from the Indonesian marine sponge Callyspongia aerizusa [44] . Callyaerins feature an unusual core structure comprising a cyclic peptide part and a linear peptide side chain, which are connected through a rare, non-proteinogenic (Z)-2,3diaminoacrylic acid (DAA) moiety.

To further evaluate this hypothesis, membrane permeability studies were employed, which showed that 102 causes permeabilization of fungal membranes in a dosedependent manner, corroborating its putative mode of action.

Bioassay-guided fractionation of a crude extract of the deep-sea-derived fungus Eurotium rubrum F33, isolated from sediment collected from the South Atlantic Ocean (2067 m depth), afforded a series of prenylated indole diketopiperazine alkaloids with antiviral activity toward the influenza virus strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) [69] . All compounds were tested against H1N1 propagated in Madin-Durby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and the known compound neoechinulin B (129) exhibited the strongest antiviral activity with an IC 50 value of 8.8 \u03bcg/ml. Moreover, 129 was found to exert high potency against oseltamivir-or amantadine-and ribavirin-resistant influenza clinical isolates with IC 50 values ranging from 5.4 to 7.1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. However, 129 showed lack of cytotoxicity against MDCK cells, highlighting its selective antiviral activity. Subsequent mode-of-action studies, employing hemagglutination inhibition, surface plasmon resonance, and polykaryon assays, revealed that 129 binds to the HA1 subunit of hemagglutinin glycoprotein, blocking its interaction with the sialic acid receptor, and thus inhibits the attachment of H1N1 virus to host cells. Interestingly, 129 was found to inhibit influenza virus (strain A/WSN/33) propagation without causing viral resistance, as shown in a multi-passage experiment, employing a plaque formation assay (even after a fifth passage), in contrast to clinically used anti-influenza drugs, such as amantadine [69] . Hence, these results demonstrated that 129 may serve as a useful lead compound for the development of new anti-influenza agents. Further investigation of the fungus Spiromastix sp. MCCC 3A00308 (see Sect. 2.2) afforded an array of new aromatic lactones with various chlorine atom substituents, spiromastilactones A-M [33] . Bioactivity assays of these compounds revealed that most of the derivatives, bearing a pseudo-depsidone skeleton, possess antiviral activity. Spiromastilactones D (130) and E (131) showed the strongest antiviral activity against A/WSN/33 (H1N1) influenza virus propagated in MDCK cells with IC 50 values of 2.8 and 5.3 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, similar to those of the positive controls oseltamivir (3.1 \u03bcg/ml) and amantadine (1.97 \u03bcg/ml). These findings allowed to conclude that monochlorination of ring B, in contrast to dichlorination, is important for expression of the strong antiviral activity of these metabolites. Moreover, formation of the pseudo-depsidone scaffold is essential for mediating antiviral properties, since the respective monomers spiromastilactone A (unit A) and divaric acid (unit B) were inactive. The most active compound, spiromastilactone D (130), exhibited a broad antiviral spectrum toward influenza A and B viruses, including oseltamivir-or amantadine-resistant clinical isolates, and therefore was chosen for further mode-of-action and molecular docking studies. Accordingly, 130 was shown to potentially bind to the hemagglutinin protein (HA1) subunit, adjacent to the sialic acid receptor binding pocket, thus disrupting the HA-sialic acid receptor interaction, which is crucial for the attachment of influenza viruses to host cells. Moreover, 130 was found to inhibit viral genome replication, probably via interfering with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex [33] , verifying this metabolite as a potential anti-influenza lead structure for further development.

Among them, HMPV is the most dangerous one as it can cause significant morbidity especially in infants and in elderly patients [71] . The brown seaweed Stypopodium zonale which is common along the Brazilian coast accumulates mainly meroditerpenes, with several of them exhibiting antiviral activity. Two meroditerpenoids atomaric acid 1 (132) [72] and epitaondiol (133) were obtained from S. zonale, and the methyl ester of atomaric acid (134) was prepared by semisynthesis [73] . Compounds 132-134 exhibited antiviral activity against HMPV replication and showed selectivity indices of >56.81, 49.26, and 12.82, respectively. Epitaondiol (133) exhibited potent anti-HMPV activity (IC 50 \u00bc 1.01 \u03bcg/ml) compared to atomaric acid methyl ester (134; IC 50 \u00bc 2.66 \u03bcg/ml) and its parent compound atomaric acid (132) (IC 50 \u00bc 3.52 \u03bcg/ml). Each compound exerted its effect by a unique mechanism: atomaric acid interacts with viral particles outside of the host cells thus preventing infection of the cell cultures. The compound has no effect on cellular receptors or on viral penetration. The meroditerpene epitaondiol (133) inhibits the penetration of viral particles into cells but without affecting the postpenetration stages or interacting with cellular receptors. The methyl ester of atomaric acid inhibits penetration of viral particles without exhibiting any effect on the postpenetration events and cellular receptors. These compounds showed selective antiviral activity with low cytotoxic activity against LLC-MK2 cells, thus highlighting their potential to inhibit HMPV in vitro [73] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe pneumonia caused by a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV); its SARS-CoV 3CL pro plays a crucial role in viral replication [74] . Betulinic acid [75] , indigo, aloe emodin [76] , the biflavonoids amentoflavones [77] , and quinone-methide triterpenoids [78] are among its naturally occurring inhibitors. Park et al. [79] , succeeded in isolating nine phlorotannins from the ethanol extract of Ecklonia cava, an edible brown alga. Six of the isolated compounds showed anti-SARS-CoV 3CL pro activity including the phlorotannin derivatives eckol (135), 2-phloroeckol (136), 7-phloroeckol (137), fucodiphloroethol G (138), dieckol (139), and phlorofucofuroeckol A (140) with IC 50 values of 2.0-20.9 \u03bcg/ml. Dieckol (139) was the most potent derivative encountered, with an IC 50 value of 2.0 \u03bcg/ml, compared to 18.1 \u03bcg/ml for the positive control hesperetin [79] . Chromatographic workup of the red alga Neorhodomela aculeata collected at the port of Namae, South Korea, afforded the new compound lanosol along with five known polybromocatechols. Two of the isolated compounds exhibited antiviral activity: 2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol (lanosol, 141) and polybromocatechol (2,2 0 ,3-tribromo-3 0 ,4,4 0 ,5-tetrahydroxy-6 0 -methoxymethyldiphenylmethane, 142). Compound 141 exhibited antiviral activity against HRV2 with an IC 50 value of 2.50 \u03bcg/ml, while compound 142 revealed anti-HRV2 activity, with an IC 50 value of 7.11 \u03bcg/ml, and anti-HRV3 activity with an IC 50 value of 4.69 \u03bcg/ml. The positive control ribavirin exhibited IC 50s of 2.15 and 5.09 \u03bcg/ml against HRV2 and HRV3, respectively. Compounds 141 and 142 were not cytotoxic making them potential drug candidates for new antiviral drugs against two different human rhinoviruses [80] . [81] . Based on the cyclic condensation and substitution pattern of the pyrrole ring, these compounds are classified as lamellarins, lukianols, polycitrins, polycitons, storniamides, and ningalins. DOPAderived alkaloids were found to exert several pharmacological activities, such as cytotoxicity, HIV-1 integrase inhibition, and multidrug resistance reversal activity in addition to immunomodulatory activity [82] . Fifteen new DOPA-derived pyrrole alkaloids, baculiferins A-O, were isolated from the marine sponge Iotrochota baculifera collected in the South China Sea (P.R. China) [82] . All compounds were found to feature one to three O-sulfate units. Among the isolated compounds, baculiferins C, E-H, and K-N (143-151) exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 IIIB virus with IC 50 values ranging from 1.4 to 8.6 \u03bcg/ml. Interestingly, these compounds showed weak to moderate activity against the tumor cell lines HCT-8, Bel-7402, BGC-823, A549, and A2780. The binding activities of these compounds to HIV-1 targets including recombinant gp41 (a transmembrane protein of HIV-1), Vif (viral infectivity factor of HIV-1), and human APOBEC3G (an innate intracellular antiviral factor) were evaluated to elucidate the mechanism of their anti-HIV activities. Baculiferins containing N-acetyl groups (149 and 150) were found to show the highest binding affinities toward both Vif (RU >1800) and APOBEC3G (RU >2170). The binding activity of these compounds suggested that the antiviral activity of the compounds is due to their interaction with the targets Vif, APOBEC3G, and/or gp41 [82] . Soft corals of the genus Sinularia (Alcyoniidae) are well-known sources of macrocyclic norcembranoids. Many of these macrocyclic norcembranoids were found to exhibit a wide array of bioactivities such as antifungal and cytotoxic properties. Sinularia gyrosa collected along the coast of the Dongsha Atoll off Taiwan was shown to yield several of these metabolites [83] . Purification of the acetone extract of this soft coral gave rise to seven new norcembranoids, gyrosanoids A-G, and in addition to known norcembranoids [84] . Among these metabolites, compound (152) was found to show significant antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with an IC 50 value of 1.9 \u03bcg/ml. Further anti-HCMV compounds were obtained from species of the soft coral genus Lobophytum collected at the Dongsha Atoll (Taiwan) which is well known for producing a large variety of bioactive secondary metabolites including cytotoxic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and HIV-inhibitory compounds [86, 87] . Chromatographic workup of an extract of L. durum gave rise to five new cembranolides durumolides M-Q, of which durumolide Q (157) exhibited significant antiviral activity against HCMV with an IC 50 value of 5.2 \u03bcg/ml [88] . Malaria is a serious infectious disease especially in Central and South America, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and India which is caused by Plasmodium parasites. It is estimated that 0.8\u00c01.2 million people die every year due to malaria [93] . Four new \u03b2-carboline alkaloids, including marinacarbolines A\u00c0D (169\u00c0172), and two new indolactam alkaloids, 13-N-demethyl-methylpendolmycin (173) and methylpendolmycin-14-O-\u03b1-glucoside (174), were obtained from the culture broth of marine actinomycete Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652 isolated from sea sediment sample in the northern South China Sea (P.R. China) obtained at a depth of 3865 m. The new compounds 169\u00c0174 exhibited antiplasmodial activities against the malaria parasite P. falciparum lines 3D7 and Dd2, with IC 50 values ranging from 0.74 to 14.0 \u03bcg/ml [94] . In 2008, an intriguing prodigiosin-related compound, marineosin A (175), was isolated from the actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNQ-617, derived from sediment collected off shore of La Jolla, California [95] . Biosynthetic studies assisted to identify the corresponding mar gene cluster, leading to 175 that appeared to be homologically similar to the red gene cluster described for the soil-dwelling S. coelicolor, responsible for the formation of undecylprodigionine (176) with additional steps requiring the spiroaminal functionality formation [96] . During further investigation, the antimalarial potency of 175 as well as of two further biosynthetic intermediates, premarineosin A (177) and 16-ketopremarineosin A (178), isolated from a mutant strain of S. venezuelae, was observed. Accordingly, the IC 50 values of 175, 177, and 178 against P. falciparum (strains D6, Dd2, and 7G8) were detected at the nanomolar range between 0.6 and 84 ng/ml, being comparable or even more potent than those of the positive control chloroquine. Notably, the most active compound, premarineosin A (177), demonstrated high SIs (347 and 2779) against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains Dd2 and 7G8, respectively. The remarkable antimalarial activity of this fascinating group of secondary metabolites inspired extensive medicinal chemistry and SAR studies. Accordingly, Kancharla and coworkers screened a library of B-ring functionalized prodiginins and 94 new synthesized tambjamine derivatives [97] . Naturally occurring tambjamines are found almost exclusively in marine invertebrates (i.e., nudibranchs, bryozoans, and ascidians), and their structures resemble those of prodigiosins, bearing an enamine moiety instead of a pyrrole moiety (ring C) as in the latter [98] . This study revealed that the bipyrrole scaffold of tambjamines has improved bioactivity profiles with regard to in vitro/in vivo antimalarial efficacy and selectivity. In particular, the analogue KAR425 (179) was shown to be an excellent antimalarial lead, being active against the multidrug-resistant strains Dd2 and 7G8 with IC 50 values of 16 and 18 ng/ml, respectively, while possessing significantly lower cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells (IC 50 \u00bc 5711 ng/ml; SI \u00bc 348 and 321, respectively). Moreover, in a subsequent in vivo study, 179 exhibited 100% protection of mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii until day 28 when administered orally during 4 days at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg or after a single-administration dose of 80 mg/kg, whereas no signs of toxic effects were observed. It is also worth noting that the proposed synthesis of KAR425 (179) includes the use of inexpensive and accessible precursors, such as cycloheptanamine, and does not involve challenging chemical reactions [97] . Thus, tambjamines and prodiginines have proven to be privileged scaffolds for library design and for development of novel antimalarial agents. [99] . This unusual derivative was isolated from Salinispora sp., obtained from a marine sediment sample, collected near Keawekaheka Bay, Hawaii, at a depth of 15 m. Salinipostin A (180) exhibited potent activity against the chloroquine-resistant W2 strain of P. falciparum with an EC 50 value of 0.024 ng/ml, demonstrating a remarkable selectivity index (SI > 1000). Furthermore, a series of related derivatives salinipostins B-K (181-190) were isolated during chemical investigation of Salinispora sp., which allowed to explore the structure-activity relationships of this new intriguing class of antimalarials. The chemical structures of 180-190 were unambiguously elucidated by detailed MS/MS as well as by 1D and 2D NMR analysis, including 31 P NMR, and their absolute configuration was deduced by means of VCD. Evaluation of the antimalarial activity of 180-190, which share a common bicyclic phosphotriester motif, revealed a broad range of EC 50 values between 0.024 (for 180) and 21.4 \u03bcg/ml (for 189), hinting at the important impact of the side chains (R 1 and R 2 ) on the antiparasitic effect of these compounds. Accordingly, derivatives with longer vinyl and/or branched R 1 chains as well as with a pentadecyl moiety at R 2 , such as salinipostins A, F, and I (180, 185, and 188, respectively), showed significantly higher activity than the rest of the analogues. Interestingly, none of the compounds displayed cytotoxicity toward mammalian HEK293T cells, indicating their high selectivity against P. falciparum. Further biological studies on P. falciparum revealed that morphological and developmental changes in the parasite culture, caused by the treatment with the most potent compound salinipostin A (180), differ from those that appear as a result of the treatment with chloroquine, suggesting a novel mode of action for 180. Moreover, growth stage specificity of 180 was evaluated with the respective wash in/wash out experiments that indicated early stages of the parasite life cycle, especially the ring stage, to be the most sensitive ones. A further attempt to generate resistant parasite populations toward 180 failed, thus suggesting that this compound is less susceptible to drug-resistance development than other currently available antimalarial drugs, possibly by targeting fundamental processes in Plasmodium growth [99] . An unprecedented polyhydroxylated macrolide with a 40-membered lactone ring, bastimolide A (191), was isolated from the recently described tropical marine cyanobacterium Okeania hirsute, collected from the Caribbean coast of Panama [100] . Chemical conversion of 191 to the respective nona-p-nitrobenzoate and subsequent X-ray analysis allowed the assignment of its absolute configuration. Bioassay screening against several causative agents of neglected parasitic tropical diseases revealed significant antimalarial activity for 191 at nanomolar concentrations toward a broad spectrum of drug-resistant P. falciparum strains (TM90-C2A, TM90-C2B, W2, and TM91-C235). The respective IC 50 values were between 63 and 213 ng/ml, whereas only moderate cytotoxicity against Vero and mammalian MCF-7 cells was observed (IC 50 Two new cyclic depsipeptides, companeramides A (192) and B (193), were isolated from a cyanobacterial assemblage collected from Coiba Island, Panama [101] . Interestingly, the structures of 192 and 193 contain the unusual amino acids 3-amino-2-methyl-7-octynoic acid (Amoya) and hydroxy isovaleric acid (Hiva), rarely encountered in nature. Both compounds exerted in vitro activity against P. falciparum strains D6, Dd2, and 7G8 at low (sub)micromolar concentrations (IC 50 values between 0.23 and 1.19 \u03bcg/ml). Compounds 192 and 193 were also tested for cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines and were found to be nontoxic at concentrations of 1.08 and 1.06 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The cytotoxicity and selectivity of these compounds at higher concentrations is yet to be studied.

Several sponge-derived peroxides showed activity against the protozoan parasites P. falciparum, Leishmania chagasi, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi [103] . The Puerto Rican sponge Plakortis halichondrioides was found to yield 5-membered-ring polyketide endoperoxides. Antimalarial assessment against P. falciparum revealed that epiplakinidioic acid (195) showed potent activity with a MIC value of 0.3 \u03bcg/ml. Semisynthetic derivatives 196 and 197 were found to show comparable antimalarial activity with MIC values of 0.6 and 0.3 \u03bcg/ml, respectively [104] . Bioassay-guided fractionation of the Australian marine sponge Plakortis sp. [106] , previously reported as a prolific source for antimalarial drugs [104, 105] , yielded two new cyclic polyketide peroxides, 11,12-didehydro-13-oxo-plakortide Q (202) and 10-carboxy-11,12,13,14-tetranorplakortide Q (203). Antitrypanosomal assay showed potent activity of 202 against T. brucei brucei with IC 50 values of 18.04 ng/ml. Compound 203, which features a carboxyl group in the side chain, showed a 20-fold decrease in activity when compared to 202. Plakortides R-U (204-207) were isolated from the sponge Plakinastrella mamillaris collected at the Fiji Islands, Melanesia, South Pacific Ocean. Plakortide U (207) was the most potent compound encountered and exhibited antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine-resistant FcM29 P. falciparum strain with an IC 50 Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or African sleeping sickness is caused mainly by two subspecies of protozoan parasites, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. The disease if not being treated is usually fatal. More than 60 million people in poor regions of Africa are endangered by this disease as stated by the WHO [108] . The Caribbean sponge Pandaros acanthifolium yielded twelve steroidal glycosides, including pandarosides E-J along with their corresponding methyl esters. The metabolites feature an unusual oxidized D-ring and a cis C/D ring junction. Pandaroside G (208) and its methyl ester (209) strongly inhibited the growth of T. brucei rhodesiense with IC 50 values of 0.6 and 0.03 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, and of L. donovani with IC 50 values of 0.99 and 0.04 \u03bcg/ml, respectively [109] . Gorgonian octocorals of the genus Eunicea, which are abundant in the Caribbean Sea, is considered to be a rich source for antimalarial compounds. Numerous natural products have been isolated from members of this genus, and most of them exhibit unique structural features and pronounced biological activities. Chromatographic workup of a Colombian gorgonian coral of the genus Eunicea afforded eighteen diterpenes of the dolabellane type. Testing the inhibitory activity of these diterpenoids toward P. falciparum W2 (chloroquine-resistant) revealed that most of these compounds were active with IC 50 values ranging from 9.4 to 59.6 \u03bcM. In particular, dolabellanone 9 (211) showed a pronounced activity with an IC 50 value of 9.4 \u03bcM (2.99 \u03bcg/ml) [111] . Two new alkaloids named didemnidines A (215) and B (216) were isolated from the methanol extract of the marine organism, Didemnum sp. ascidian, obtained from Tiwai Wharf at 7 m depth, Tiwai Point, Southland, New Zealand. Compounds 215 and 216 feature an indole-3-glyoxylamide moiety connected to the N-1 position of spermidine which is rare in marine organisms. Didemnidine B (216) was active against the malaria parasite P. falciparum (IC 50 5.9 \u03bcg/ml). The semisynthetic compound N 1 -(6-bromoindolyl-3-glyoxamido)-N 8 -tert-butoxycarbonylspermidine (217) showed an IC 50 value against P. falciparum of 4.2 \u03bcg/ml and against T. brucei rhodesiense of 4.9 \u03bcg/ml, respectively [112] . Chemical investigation of the marine ascidian Eudistoma sp. led to the isolation of three unusual related alkaloids, eudistidines A-C [113] . Among them, eudistidine C (1:1 mixture of 218a and 218b) represents a highly complex alkaloid, bearing fused pyrimidine and imidazole rings, a guanidine, as well as amidine moieties. The proton-deficient nucleus of eudistidine C was unambiguously assigned with the help of a new sensitive NMR pulse sequence LR-HSQMBC (long-range heteronuclear single-quantum multiple-bond correlation), allowing the detection of 4 J CH and 5 J CH correlations [114] . Total synthesis of eudistidine C confirmed the structure of this alkaloid, and a series of aryl-substituted (at C-10) derivatives were obtained. Eudistidine C epimers (218a and 218b), eudistidine B (219), and their synthetic congeners (220-224) exhibited significant antiparasitic activity against chloroquinesensitive D6 and chloroquine-resistant W2 P. falciparum strains with IC 50 values in the range from 0.26 to 3.4 \u03bcg/ml [113] . The antimalarial potency of these compounds was investigated employing a plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase activity assay with artemisinin and chloroquine as positive controls. Interestingly, 218a showed an up to 1.7-fold stronger antimalarial activity toward both P. falciparum strains in comparison with its epimer 218b. Among the tested compounds, 219 and its synthetic derivative 224 exhibited the most potent antiplasmodial effect against D6 and W2 strains with MIC values of 0.46 and 0.36 \u03bcg/ml (for 219) and 0.48 and 0.26 \u03bcg/ml (for 224), respectively. Moreover, a subsequent cytotoxicity assay against Vero cells (monkey kidney fibroblasts) revealed no apparent activity for 218a,b-224, suggesting their selective antimalarial activity. Additionally, compounds 218b, 220, 221, and 224 were found to inhibit the binding of the oncogenic transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) to p300 [113] . Thus, eudistidines C (218a,b) and B (219), as well as their synthetic analogues, carrying the tetracyclic eudistidine-like scaffold, represent a novel class of lead structures for the development of potent and selective antimalarial agents. Convolutamines I (225) and J (226) were obtained from the marine bryozoan Amathia tortuosa collected at the Bass Strait, Tasmania, Australia. Compounds 225 and 226 were shown to be active against the parasite T. brucei brucei with IC 50 values of 0.52 and 6.44 \u03bcg/ml, respectively [115] ( Anti-influenza A H1N1 [33] (continued) Natural products have been the most successful source of lead compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases since the dawn of the antibiotic era. In recent years, the emergence of resistant microbial strains against virtually all major classes of known anti-infectives poses a worldwide health threat, and thus further mining of natural sources for novel anti-infective agents is eminent [116] . Marine macro-and microorganisms have not been systematically investigated as a source of novel antiinfective agents, despite the fact that more than three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by the seas and oceans. Nevertheless, continued interest in the quest for structurally unprecedented bioactive secondary metabolites in combination with recent advances in sampling techniques has opened new avenues for the exploration of this fascinating ecological niche [7, 117] . Indeed, over the last decade, increased marine bioprospecting efforts were observed, particularly aimed at the deep-sea [82] environment, providing novel leads [118] . As a matter of fact, the potent proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A, from the marine sediment actinomycete Salinispora tropica, has recently entered phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent [119] . Undoubtedly, the marine environment represents an untapped source of bioactive chemical entities, many of which featuring new carbon frameworks without any terrestrial counterparts. This structural richness may give rise to potential scaffolds for the exploration of new biological targets, thus offering the advantage of the discovery of anti-infective leads with novel mechanisms of action tackling the global challenge posed by antibiotic resistance [120] . Several metabolites from various marine sources (i.e., sponges, bacteria, and fungi), described in this review, have already been identified as lead structures against both drug-sensitive and drugresistant pathogens, such as the antiviral spiromastilactones (130 and 131), the antibacterial anthracimycin (22) , or the antimalarial thiaplakortones (198-201) and salinipostins (180-190) possessing activities at (sub)micromolar concentrations [20, 33, 99, 105] . Hence, given the enormous potential of marine natural products in drug development, as demonstrated by the success stories of several marketed marine-derived drugs (i.e., Halaven\u00ae, Adcertis\u00ae, Yondelis\u00ae), it becomes increasingly apparent that the oceans hold great promises as the next source of novel antiinfective agents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 277, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 674, "end": 679, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 758, "end": 763, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 830, "end": 835, "text": "[104,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1539, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1891, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2364, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 3113, "end": 3118, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3797, "end": 3802, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 3939, "end": 3944, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 4391, "end": 4396, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 4826, "end": 4831, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 5742, "end": 5747, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 6272, "end": 6277, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 6302, "end": 6306, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 6712, "end": 6717, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 7190, "end": 7193, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 7194, "end": 7198, "text": "117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 7321, "end": 7325, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 7361, "end": 7366, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 7568, "end": 7573, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 8029, "end": 8034, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 8342, "end": 8346, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 8479, "end": 8483, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 8484, "end": 8487, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 8488, "end": 8491, "text": "99,", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 8492, "end": 8496, "text": "105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From Invertebrates"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Natural products as sources of new drugs from 1981 to 2014", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Newman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Cragg", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "J Nat Prod", "volume": "79", "issn": "3", "pages": "629--661", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Antibacterial drug discovery in the resistance era", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Wright", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "529", "issn": "7586", "pages": "336--343", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Platforms for antibiotic discovery", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Lewis", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Nat Rev Drug Discov", "volume": "12", "issn": "5", "pages": "371--387", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "The role of natural product chemistry in drug discovery", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Butler", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "J Nat Prod", "volume": "67", "issn": "12", "pages": "2141--2153", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Antimicrobial resistance: 2014 global report on surveillance.

The structure-activity relationship revealed that (1) the thiazine moiety does not influence the antimalarial activity and (2) the 2-methylaminopropanoic acid chain decreases the antimalarial activity as indicated in 200 and 201, while the ethylamine side chain increases the activity as seen in 198[105].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF40": {"text": "(208) :R=H Pandaroside G methyl ester (209) : R=MeCristaxenicin A (210) is a diterpenoid, isolated from the deep-sea Gorgonian Acanthoprimnoa cristata collected from Yakushima-Shinsone, Kagoshima Prefecture, southern Japan.
