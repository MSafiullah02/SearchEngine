            "text": "Despite their ability to trigger potent innate and adaptive immune responses, the widespread use of DNA vaccines has been hampered logistically by the requirement of specialized methods such as electroporation (EP) for effective delivery.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Delivery methods that require specialized training, advanced technology, or access to a sustainable power source pose significant challenges in remote areas or when enacting a ring vaccination strategy in an outbreak setting. A simpler approach for DNA vaccine delivery that can provide protective efficacy comparable to EP could be advantageous for the broader applicability of this platform. One possible approach for improving DNA vaccine immunogenicity is to modify the DNA vaccine backbone itself. This can include modification of the promoter to enhance antigen expression, removal of antibiotic selection markers, and elimination of nonfunctional sequences that can limit expression. Nature Technology Corporation (NTC) has tested this approach by developing minimalized Nanoplasmid expression vectors.6,7 These vectors are smaller than traditional DNA vaccine plasmids, allowing for improved uptake and persistence in transfected cells. Large extragenic regions of bacterial DNA can also mediate transgene silencing in certain tissues, a phenomenon that may be avoided by the use of shorter DNA sequences.8 This subsequently leads to increased transgene expression that can yield enhanced immune responses and sustained improvements in immunological memory.9 NTC has also designed Nanoplasmid vectors that co-express innate immune immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA) agonists to function as type I interferon-\u03b1\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1\u03b2)-inducing genetic adjuvants. These vectors co-express a retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) agonist (NTC-eRNA) or the dsRNA RIG-I agonist as well as a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulating CpG motif (NTC-eRNA-CpG). IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 is a powerful genetic adjuvant, enhancing both cellular and humoral responses.10, 11, 12, 13 NTC previously tested an influenza H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine expressed from the NTC-eRNA vector.14 Vaccination with the NTC-eRNA/HA vaccine significantly improved antibody titers and antibody binding avidity compared to the standard NTC/HA vector. Additionally, as IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 is required for optimal DNA vaccine immunogenicity,1,15,16 inclusion of an IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 stimulating agonist may compensate for any reduction in the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine delivered in the absence of EP.",

For this, COS-7 cells were transfected with 50, 100, or 250 ng of the individual Nanoplasmid constructs or our standard pWRG7077 vaccine plasmids, and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for analysis of antigen expression levels by flow cytometry.

Vaccination with the NTC/VEEV construct resulted in slightly improved, but statistically similar, total immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-VEEV antibody levels compared to those observed in mice receiving the pWRG/VEEV vaccine (Figure 2A). In contrast, the NTC/VEEV construct with the added isRNA RIG-I agonist yielded a significant increase in total IgG titers. However, additional inclusion of the CpG motif within this construct did not further boost the total IgG response compared to the NTC-eRNA/VEEV vaccine. Although not statistically significant, vaccination with the NTC-eRNA/VEEV or NTC-eRNA-CpG/VEEV constructs also resulted in IgG1 and IgG2a subtype antibody titers that trended slightly higher than those for the pWRG/VEEV or standard NTC/VEEV constructs (Figures 2B and 2C). Moreover, vaccination with both isRNA-expressing Nanoplasmids trended toward slightly enhanced VEEV-neutralizing antibody generation, suggesting a broad improvement in the humoral response (Figure 2D). Unlike for the antibody response, we observed little discernable difference in the cell-mediated immunity elicited in vaccinated mice, as those receiving either the pWRG/VEEV or various Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines displayed similar numbers of VEEV E1- or E2-specific IFN-\u03b3+ (Figures 3A and 3B) and interleukin-2+ (IL-2+) T cells (Figures 3C and 3D) as quantified by ELISPOT.

However, this improved antigen production did not seem to have a significant impact on short-term vaccine immunogenicity, as both the NTC/VEEV and NTC/EBOV vaccines elicited comparable immune responses to the respective pWRG7077-based vaccines. Instead, it appears that the inclusion of the isRNA innate immune agonist had the greatest influence on vaccine immunogenicity. Despite the importance of RIG-I signaling in generating antigen-specific T cells,34 we did not measure a significant increase in the numbers of IFN-\u03b3+ or IL-2+ T cells for either antigen. This is in agreement with previous findings that the isRNA expression did not enrich T cell immunity, possibly due to the lack of a hairpin structure in the dsRNA transcribed from the Nanoplasmids.14,35 Conversely, inclusion of the isRNA adjuvant yielded improved viral GP-specific IgG titers and trended toward improved virus neutralizing antibody titers. This is most likely due to IFN-\u03b1\u03b2\u2019s ability to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules, priming CD4+ T cells, and driving the subsequent B cell response.36,37 IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 also amplifies the sensitivity of the B cell receptor, boosting the ability of naive B cells to produce high-affinity antibodies.38 Somewhat surprisingly, the addition of CpG motifs had a limited effect on VEEV DNA vaccine immunogenicity. One possible explanation for this result is the limited effect of TLR9 signaling on DNA vaccine immunogenicity.1,39 Alternatively, our results may suggest that a peak response was achieved by inclusion of the RIG-I agonist, and more subtle immune differences may be better discerned at a lower vaccine dose.",

However, neutralizing antibody titers are not always significantly associated with protection against VEEV challenge by the aerosol route. Non-neutralizing antibodies have also proven effective at preventing lethal alphavirus infection, and it has been reported that vaccine-elicited IgG2a (i.e., Th1 phenotype) correlates strongly with protection from aerosol VEEV challenge.43 This effect may be due to IgG2a\u2019s broad range of effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement fixation.40 The co-expression of isRNA from the Nanoplasmid vector resulted in increased IgG2a production, albeit not to a statistically significant degree. However, IM vaccinated mice that had a higher ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 appeared to be better protected from VEEV challenge (Figure S2), suggesting that the improvement in IgG2a levels may have been substantial enough to afford greater protection from challenge. Taken together, the IgG2a data combined with the improved neutralizing capability suggests that the isRNA expressing Nanoplasmid vectors can shape multiple facets of the adaptive immune response required for protection against VEEV challenge.",

Vaccination with NTC/EBOV resulted in antibody responses that trended higher than those quantified in the pWRG/EBOV group. The humoral response was further boosted by the addition of the dsRNA/CpG adjuvant. Notably, both Nanoplasmid vaccinated groups exhibited higher levels of IgG2a than did the pWRG/EBOV group. While the correlates of protection for EBOV remain unclear, several reports have detailed the role of IgG2a in conferring protection to EBOV challenge in mice.28,44 Moreover, Warfield et al.45 previously reported that an EBOV VLP vaccine elicited strong ADCC activity in vaccinated NHPs. Follow-on studies suggested that this vaccine elicited weakly neutralizing, but highly protective Th1 antibodies.46 Our study suggests a similar protective effect of IgG2a, as IM vaccinated mice with a higher ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 lost less weight following challenge (Figure S3). Although we were not able to quantify significant changes in protection to EBOV challenge at the DNA dose tested here, it is noteworthy that Nanoplasmid vaccination did not negatively impact protective efficacy. In fact, the sustained weight seen in the NTC-eRNA-CpG/EBOV group suggests that the isRNA may have the ability to augment protective efficacy beyond what was measured here. Follow-on EBOV challenge studies performed using a range of DNA vaccine doses will be required to definitively determine the impact of the Nanoplasmid vector platform.",

            "text": "Overall, our results demonstrate that vaccination with next-generation Nanoplasmid vectors can improve DNA vaccine immunogenicity when delivered by simple IM injection in the absence of EP. Furthermore, the inclusion of innate immune agonists, such as dsRNA and/or CpG motifs, can significantly boost protective efficacy. However, several questions remain to be addressed in future studies. Of interest is the ability of the Nanoplasmids to improve immunological memory, as well as their ability to spur affinity maturation. Previous reports demonstrating sustained antigen production from Nanoplasmid transfected cells suggest that these effects are possible, but we have yet to characterize them as they were outside the scope of these studies. Finally, as no groups vaccinated by IM injection generated immune responses equal to those elicited by IM-EP, further studies are required to determine whether the Nanoplasmid vectors sufficiently enhance DNA vaccine immunogenicity such that they could offer protective immunity to NHPs, which are a more relevant model of human disease.",

The pWRG/EBOV DNA vaccine plasmid was constructed in a similar manner by inserting the codon-optimized GP genes (Geneart, Regensburg, Germany) of EBOV-Kikwit 1995 (GenBank: U28077) into the pWRG7077 eukaryotic expression vector as described previously.24 Codon-optimization of the EBOV GP gene sequence resulted in the ablation of the 7U/8U genomic editing motif of EBOV, preventing production of soluble GP (sGP). The Nanoplasmid vaccines were produced by standard restriction digestion-mediated transfer of the pWRG7077 VEEV and EBOV transgenes into the Nanoplasmid NTC9385R, NTC9385R-eRNA41H, or NTC9385R-eRNA41H-CpG vector. Plasmid NTC9385R is a Nanoplasmid expression vector that contains a bacterial backbone comprising a 140 bp RNA-based sucrose selectable antibiotic free marker (RNA-OUT) and a 300 bp R6K origin.6 NTC9385R derivatives NTC9385R-eRNA41H and NTC9385R-eRNA41H-CpG RNA co-express isRNA with antigen. The RNA is transcribed by either RNA Pol II (isRNA encoded downstream of transgene in the 3\u2032 UTR; CpG RNA) or RNA Pol III (isRNA transcribed independently from transgene; eRNA41H, a 114 bp RNA Pol III convergently transcribed non-palindromic dsRNA based isRNA that activates RIG-I).14,47 In these vectors, EBOV or VEEV transgenes are expressed from the CMV promoter upstream of the HTLV-IR expression enhancer.48 Research-grade pWRG7077 vaccine plasmids were manufactured by Aldevron (Fargo, ND), while research-grade Nanoplasmid vaccine plasmids were manufactured by Nature Technology Corporation (Lincoln, NE).",
