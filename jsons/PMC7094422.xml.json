            "text": "Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), a prototype of paramyxoviruses, is an avian enveloped RNA-negative strand virus that causes respiratory disease in domestic fowls leading to huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The envelope of NDV contains two associated glycoproteins that mediate viral entry: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins. HN is the receptor-binding protein that recognizes and binds to sialoglycoconjugates at the cell surface [1]. The fusion protein is a metastable protein that undergoes a series of irreversible conformational changes to trigger the fusion of the viral and plasma membrane in a pH-independent manner [2]. Nevertheless, we have previously reported an additional pathway of NDV entry through caveolae-dependent endocytosis [3]. For most paramyxoviruses, including NDV, the triggering of F protein is HN-dependent through its fusion promotion activity. The mechanism by which HN protein activates F in a homotypic manner is not well understood [4], [5].",

Although their existence is still controversial, the resistance of these components to cold detergent extraction and mechanical disruption has been considered proof of their existence (for a review, see [6]). Caveolae, a particular membrane raft subset, are cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane microdomains, identifiable as stable invaginations of the plasma membrane, which are enriched in caveolin, a membrane protein that is tightly bound to cholesterol [7]. Lipids rafts have been implicated in functions such as membrane signaling and trafficking, signal transduction and the regulation of cell adhesion [8].",

The data concerning RSV are controversial. Thus, some authors have reported the independence of RSV entry from cholesterol [31], whereas in other works the entry of RSV through caveolae in dendritic cells has been proposed [32]. Moreover, using small interfering RNA technology [33] showed that RSV use clathrin-mediated endocytosis to productively infect cells.

In the present paper, we extend these studies with a view to clarifying the functional role of cholesterol in NDV entry. Depletion of cellular cholesterol by treatment with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) inhibited NDV binding, fusion and infectivity. This inhibition was almost completely compensated by replenishing cellular cholesterol levels, suggesting that the effect of M\u03b2CD treatment on virus activities would be due to the removal of cholesterol. Analysis of the distribution of viral envelope glycoproteins in cholesterol-rich resistant membranes showed that viral glycoproteins partially associate with lipid rafts during initial virus adsorption and entry. Our data corroborate a role of cell membrane cholesterol during the early stages of NDV infection. A clear understanding of the role of lipid membrane components in viral entry should be useful in the future for designing antiviral agents and vaccines.",

As a negative control, the virus was inactivated by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 2 min. No differences with samples in the absence of virus were detected, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. To analyze whether cholesterol depletion was affecting the expression of viral receptors at the cell surface, after the M\u03b2CD treatment, cells were labeled with two fluorescent-labeled lectins, FITC-MALI and FITC-SNA. The binding of FITC-MALI to cells preincubated in the presence of sialidase from Vibrio cholerae was reduced as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S3) revealing the specificity of lectin binding to sialoglycoconjugates. The degree of binding of both lectins to treated cells was similar to that of control cells (Fig. 2b), indicating that after cholesterol removal the receptor concentration was not modified at the cell surface. Nevertheless, when we analyzed the lectin-labeled cells by confocal microscopy, the FITC-MALI lectin-staining pattern was altered (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S4): upon M\u03b2CD treatment, the cell surface displayed patches enriched in sialic acid compound (Fig. 2c), in agreement with previous reports [34], [46].",

In negative controls, the virus was inactivated by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 2 min. No differences with samples in the absence of virus were detected, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Additionally, cellular cholesterol was depleted at several time points post-infection by treatment with 10 mM M\u03b2CD (Fig. 3b). ELL-0 cells were infected with rNDV-F3aa-mRFP recombinant NDV. Viral infectivity was monitored at 24 h post-infection, as detailed in Materials and methods. The results showed that the addition of M\u03b2CD at 1 h post-infection did not exert any inhibitory effect on NDV. Moreover, treatment with M\u03b2CD at 20 min post-infection only had a moderate effect (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that cholesterol is required during the entry of NDV into the host cell during the first stages of viral infectivity.",

After the depletion of cellular cholesterol by pre-treatment with 10 mM M\u03b2CD, cholesterol-depleted cells were incubated in the presence of M\u03b2CD previously complexed to cholesterol, acting as a cholesterol donor to cells [12]. The addition of 200 \u03bcM of exogenous cholesterol almost completely restored cellular cholesterol levels to those of the controls (Fig. 4a). Our data revealed a correlation between the degree of cholesterol replacement (Fig. 4a) and the degree of recovery of NDV activities (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Viral fusion and infectivity were recovered by almost 100% in comparison with the control (Fig. 4b, d and Table 2); viral binding was recovered up to 70% (Fig. 4c). In sum, the recovery of viral activities following cholesterol replenishment strongly supports the notion that the inhibitory effects of M\u03b2CD treatment on NDV activities would be due specifically to cholesterol depletion per se, and that this effect would be reversible.",

As can be seen, in 10 mM M\u03b2CD-treated cells the synthesis of viral F and NP proteins was reduced. The addition of cholesterol to M\u03b2CD-treated cells prior to virus infection led to an increase in the synthesis of viral proteins as compared to M\u03b2CD-treated ELL-0 cells. The levels of cellular GAPDH were unaffected by M\u03b2CD treatment or virus infection. These results indicated that the synthesis of viral proteins was reduced in cholesterol-depleted cells, in support of the infectivity inhibition data shown in Fig. 3. We observed a certain stimulatory effect of protein expression in the presence of 200 \u03bcM exogenous cholesterol, which correlates with some enhancement of viral infectivity (Table 2). This enhancement might be related to the increase of cholesterol in the cell membrane above normal values (Fig. 4a), although further research is needed to clarify the significance of this enhancement.",

We analyzed the association of viral proteins with isolated DRMs from ELL-0 cells by treatment with TX100 at low temperatures, followed by discontinuous OptiPrep flotation gradients, as detailed in Materials and methods. As a control, caveolin, a protein raft marker, was mainly present in the detergent-resistant fractions 5 and 6, whereas \u03b2-tubulin was mainly found in the detergent-soluble membrane fractions 11 and 12 (Fig. 6a). For some samples, NDV was bound to cells for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 6a, HN 4 \u00b0C); for other samples, after virus binding for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, cells were shifted to 37 \u00b0C for an additional hour (Fig. 6a, HN 4 \u00b0C/37 \u00b0C). Then, the cells were lysed and layered at the bottom of a 40%\u201330%\u20135% OptiPrep density gradient. Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting, probing with a polyclonal anti-NDV antibody. We found that after virus binding at 4 \u00b0C, HN was distributed in both the low density Triton-insoluble fractions 5 and 6 as well as in the detergent-soluble fractions. Nevertheless, after virus\u2013cell samples shifting to 37 \u00b0C, the association of HN to raft fractions was limited to fraction 6. These results were also corroborated in HeLa cells, where HN protein was distributed in both the raft and non-raft fractions (Fig. 6b, HN 4 \u00b0C/37 \u00b0C). After M\u03b2CD incubation of cells (Fig. 6b, HN 10 mM M\u03b2CD), the viral protein concentration was reduced and was mainly associated with the non-raft fractions. After the replenishment of cholesterol (Fig. 6b, HN 10 mM M\u03b2CD + 200 \u03bcM Cho), the distribution of HN in the flotation gradient fractions was as observed in the case of the control cells (Fig. 6b HN 4 \u00b0C/37 \u00b0C).",

            "text": "Among their different functions, membrane rafts exert a concentrating effect on proteins. Receptors and coreceptors of several viruses have been reported to be associated with lipid rafts on cell membranes such, as CD4 for HIV-1 [50]. During viral attachment, protein recruitment would facilitate protein interactions, leading to viral entry either through a concentration of viral receptors in lipid rafts and/or through a concentration of viral envelope proteins facilitating the formation of the viral protein fusion scaffold [48]. The dependence of the binding of HIV-1 envelope gp120 glycoprotein to lipid rafts on cholesterol strongly supports the idea that raft-colocalized receptors would be directly involved in virus entry [50], [51], [52]. Similarly, for NDV it could be speculated that rafts might act as a platform for local concentrations of receptors and coreceptors, such as glycosphingolipids and/or glycoproteins. During the very early binding steps, a percentage of HN would colocalize to lipid rafts (Fig. 6a, HN 4 \u00b0C) shifting to non-raft fractions as the viral\u2013cell interaction progresses (Fig. 6a, HN 4 \u00b0C/37 \u00b0C). This could explain the negative effect of cholesterol removal on NDV binding. The partial colocalization of viral proteins to DRMs during binding suggests a weak or partial interaction with rafts, as proposed for other viruses [21], [22]. The different patterns of lectin staining in control and cholesterol-depleted cells suggest that a pool of sialic acid glycoconjugates recognized by NDV might be associated with lipid rafts and that could be modified after cholesterol removal, whereas sialic acid concentrations at the cell surface would not be modified (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the data presented here differ from our previous data, which showed that most HN was located in the DRM fractions after viral binding to COS-7 cells [45]. These differences might be cell-dependent, ELL-0 avian fibroblasts being the natural viral host. Additionally, the formation and enlargement of a fusion pore requires the concerted action of several viral proteins [53]. Therefore, the disruption of lipid rafts might hinder the assembly of the viral envelope glycoproteins needed for the formation of the fusion scaffold [54]. In this sense, it has been proposed that the increase in the antiviral potency of cholesterol-tagged-peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat regions of viral fusion proteins, including those of paramyxoviruses, would be related to the preconcentration or targeting of these peptides to lipid rafts [55], [56].",

            "text": "Cholesterol removal and/or lipid raft disruption negatively affect the caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis that is used as pathway of entry by several viruses [57], [58], [59]. Cholesterol has also been implicated as a regulatory factor in the entry of viruses that use clathrin and non-clathrin non caveolar/lipid raft endocytic pathways [49]. Recently, Melikyan's team [60] have demonstrated that HIV productively infects cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which helps to explain the dependence of HIV on target membrane cholesterol [61]. Previously, we have reported the colocalization of NDV with caveolin and with the early endosome marker EEA1, leading us to propose that a certain percentage of the virus manages to penetrate the cell through caveolin-dependent endocytic pathways [3]. In this context, it is possible that removal of the cholesterol could negatively affect NDV entry by altering endocytic pathways. The absence of a total blockade of virus\u2013cell fusion and infectivity after M\u03b2CD treatment (Table 1), as well as the partial association of HN with DRM fractions, may suggest that NDV entry would take place in both raft and non-raft environments. Nevertheless, further research into how the association of NDV with lipid rafts facilitates viral entry is required. Our data indicate a stronger effect of cholesterol removal on NDV binding than on fusion (Table 1). Moreover, after cholesterol replenishment, fusion and infectivity were almost completely recovered, whereas binding was not (Table 2). Therefore, it could be argued that some non-productive binding sites were permanently removed after M\u03b2CD treatment, whereas productive binding sites were recovered after cholesterol replenishment, allowing viral fusion and infectivity to occur efficiently.",

In Sendai virus, another paramyxovirus, the role of AKT1 and Raf/MEK/ERK cascades during viral fusion has been recently reported [65]. Moreover, it has been reported that cholesterol removal alters the actin cytoskeleton [66], which might negatively affect viral interaction with cells since cortical actin has been implicated in virus entry [49].",
