Extensive linkage maps and an impressive array of inbred strains are now available to expedite sophisticated genetic research. Mice have 40 chromosomes that are differentiated by the size and patterns of transverse bands. The chromosomes are designated by Arabic numbers in order of decreasing size. During the 1970s, chromosome rearrangements were used to assign known genetic linkage groups\u2014identified by Roman numerals\u2014to specific chromosomes and for determining locus order with respect to the centromere. Genes can now be located physically on chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and the Genome Initiative programs are fostering development of molecular maps of mouse chromosomes. The sequence of the mouse genome is expected to be completed by 2003 (Battey et al., 1999).",

Mice carrying spontaneous or induced mutations and strains susceptible to specific diseases provide a wide variety of mouse model systems for basic research, as well as models for biomedical research to understand specific human disorders. For example, several spontaneous mutations in genes affecting pituitary function or producing hormones provide mutant models for human dwarfing conditions. Targeted mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein genes provide model systems for studying cardiovascular disorders. Mice of the NOD (nonobese diabetic) strain provide a model for human insulin-dependent diabetes. Mice also provide reagents for basic research. For example, inbred histocompatible strains are used extensively as donors of plasma cell tumors to immortalize cell lines (hybridomas) that secrete highly uniform, monospecific immunoglobulins in vitro, theoretically in unlimited quantities. This technology has made a full range of functional mouse antibody molecules available for study. Development of quantitative trait loci (QTL) methodology for mapping genes and the similarity between mouse and human genomes have made the mouse invaluable for identifying genes and underlying complex traits that are inherent to the most common human genetic diseases (Darvasi, 1998; Frankel, 1995).",

            "text": "One of the most thoroughly studied genetic systems of the mouse is the histocompatibility complex. Histocompatibility (H) loci control expression of cell surface molecules that modulate major immunological phenomena, such as the recognition of foreign tissue. For example, the time, onset, and speed of skin graft rejection are controlled by two groups of H loci. The major group is located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, H2) on chromosome 17. These genes cause rapid rejection (10\u201320 days) of grafts that display foreign H2 antigens. Minor H loci groups are scattered throughout the genome and are responsible for delayed graft rejection. Genes associated with the H2 complex also control other immunological functions, such as cell-cell interactions in primary immune responses and the level of response to a given antigen. Immune-mediated responses to infectious agents such as viruses and complement activity are influenced directly or indirectly by the H2 complex. The most recent comprehensive review of the H2 complex is by Klein (1986). Because information about this subject is being published so frequently, the reader is advised to consult bibliographic indexes such as MEDLINE for recent updates. Non-MHC or minor histocompatibility systems also are under active study (Roopenian and Simpson, 2000).",

            "text": "Laboratory mice are identified by strain and by breeding system. A genealogy of most inbred strains is presented in the Mouse Genome Database <http://www.informatics.jax.org>. Table I\nsummarizes nine breeding systems. Each requires technical skill and a firm understanding of mammalian genetics. Inbred strains were developed first in 1909 by Clarence Cook Little and offer a high degree of genetic uniformity. Mice within an inbred strain, for practical purposes, are genetically identical to other mice of the same strain and sex. They are defined as being produced by brother\u2013sister matings for more than 20 generations. In fact, a strain should not be considered completely inbred until after 40 generations of sibling matings. Inbred strains are valuable because experimental results are reproducible with relatively small sample sizes. They are useful for genetic mapping because they are genetically well characterized, and allelic combinations can be predetermined for linkage crosses. Wild-derived inbred strains of Mus musculus castaneus and M. spretus are used extensively for mapping because of the large number of polymorphic differences from standard inbred laboratory mice. F1 hybrid mice, produced by mating mice of two inbred strains, also are genetically identical to each other and may offer a more robust animal for some studies. For example, inbred strains may differ in behavior and learning abilities, whereas hybrid mice are less likely to have learning deficits or behavioral anomalies. Mutant inbred strains carry spontaneous, targeted, or induced mutations, transgenes, or chromosome aberrations. The genetic backgrounds of such strains are homogeneous like those of regular inbred strains, but some (or all) mice of the strain carry the mutation (or chromosome aberration). In segregating inbred mutant strains, mutant mice differ from their nonmutant siblings only by the mutation. Therefore, littermates can serve as controls in experiments. In homozygous mutant strains, controls must come from the same or a closely related nonmutant inbred strain. For example, C57BL/6J mice provide controls for the homozygous mutant C57BL/6J-m/m strain. A strain is said to be coisogenic if the mutation of interest occurred in that strain. A strain is congenic if the mutation or gene of interest was transferred from another strain or stock by repeated backcrossing. Detailed descriptions and diagrams of mating schemes have been provided by Green (1981a,b), and additional contemporary information on mouse genetics and breeding can be found by consulting Table II\n.",

            "text": "In contrast to inbred mice, random bred, or outbred, mice are genetically heterogeneous and are often produced by breeding systems that intentionally minimize inbreeding. Outbred mice may be used when high genetic heterogeneity is desired or for experiments requiring large numbers of mice. However, it is preferable to ensure genetic heterogeneity by intercrossing multiple inbred strains to achieve heterogeneity with known genetic input. Individual random bred mice within a colony may differ in coat color, histocompatibility loci, enzyme and DNA polymorphisms, and other characteristics. Random breeding requires the statistically random selection of breeders by using a random numbers table or computer program. Random breeding, or outbreeding, can be achieved only in a large colony. A small breeding population or passage through the genetic \u201cbottleneck\u201d of rederivation to improve health status will reduce genetic heterogeneity and lead eventually to some degree of inbreeding. In fact, supposedly \u201crandom bred\u201d stocks are often genetically quite homogeneous. In a population of 25 breeding pairs, for example, heterozygosity will decrease at 1% per generation with standard randomization techniques. A random breeding program that is easy to manage is the circular pair mating system, in which each pair is mated only once. Conceptually, cages are visualized in a circle, and each cage contains one breeding pair in the nth generation. Another \u201ccircular\u201d set of cages serves as the breeding nucleus for the n + 1 generation. Each mated pair in the nth generation contributes one female and one male to the n + 1 generation. Random breeding is accomplished by assigning the female and male derived from each nth generation cage to different cages in the n + 1 generation.",

            "text": "\nRecombinant inbred (RI) strains are sets of inbred strains developed by single-pair random matings of mice from an F2 generation created by crossing mice of two inbred strains. Lines are propagated by brother\u2013sister matings for more than 20 generations to obtain homozygosity. Recombinant inbred strains may take as long as 7 years to produce. RI strains are valuable for mapping phenotypic or quantitative traits that differ between the progenitor strains. Because each line is inbred, genotyping and phenotyping data are cumulative. RI sets are especially valuable for controlling for environmental variability in a trait, because several genetically identical mice from each line in a set can be typed to score the line for a trait (Bailey, 1971; Taylor, 1996). Recombinant congenic strains are sets of inbred strains derived in a manner similar to that for RI sets, except that one or more backcrosses to one parental strain (designated the background strain) are made after the F1 generation, before inbreeding is begun. The other parental strain is designated as the donor strain. The proportion of background and donor genomes is determined by the number of backcrosses preceding inbreeding (Demant and Hart, 1986). Advanced intercross Lines (AILs) are a third type of RI line. AILs are made by producing an F2 generation between two inbred strains and then, in each subsequent generation, intercrossing mice but avoiding sibling matings. The purpose is to increase the possibility of recombination between tightly linked genes.

Strains are designated by a series of letters and/or numbers, which frequently provide a shorthand description of the origin and history of the strain (Table III\n). For example, the inbred strain C57BL/6J originated from female 57 at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (C), was the black (BL) line from this female, and is subline number 6. Sublines of an inbred strain are designated using Laboratory Registration Codes (Lab Codes), unique-2- to 4-letter codes that may be obtained from a central registry maintained at the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research in Washington, D.C. <http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/ilarhome.nsf>. The J in C57BL/6J means it is the subline maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (J). A new type of strain designation has been created for new inbred strains made by intercrossing mice of two existing inbred strains. This is essential because many engineered mutations are made in 129-derived embryonic stem cells, recovered in C57BL/6\u2013129 chimeras, and then maintained by brother\u2013sister matings after the first generation. For example, an inbred strain derived by sibling matings from a C57BL/6 \u00d7 129 chimera is designated B6129. A noninbred stock that meets specific criteria is designated by placing the Lab Code before the stock symbol, separated by a full colon. For example, Hsd:ICR designates an ICR outbred stock maintained by Harlan (\u201cInternational standardized nomenclature,\u201d 1972). Specific designations also distinguish coisogenic, congenic, segregating inbred, and various RI strains. The type of strain or stock often can be recognized from the correct symbol. For example, BXD-1/Ty is line 1 in a set of RI strains derived from a C57BL/6J (B) female mated to a DBA/2J (D) male and made by Taylor (Ty).",

When a mutant gene is cloned, the symbol for the parent gene is used and the mutant allele is designated in superscript. For example, Mbpshi is the shiverer mutant allele in the myelin basic protein gene. Nomenclature for genetically engineered mice can be complex and may eventually require simplification. Currently, a transgenic strain is designated by a symbol for the strain followed by a symbol for the transgene. Transgene symbols take the form Tg(YYYYY) #Zzz, where Tg is the transgene, (YYYYY) is a brief description of the inserted DNA (such as a gene symbol), # is the assigned number in the series of events generated using a given construct, and Zzz is the Lab Code. When a transgene causes an insertional mutation in an endogenous gene, the mutant allele of the gene is designated by using the gene symbol and an abbreviation for the transgene as a superscript (e.g., inTg/Zzz). A targeted mutation, or knockout, is designated by the mutated gene with the identification of the mutational event as a superscript. For example, Cftrfm1 Unc is the first mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene created at the University of North Carolina. A gene replacement, or knockin, uses similar nomenclature; Myf5Myod indicates that the Myf5 gene was replaced by the Myod gene.",

Several caging systems with tops containing filters are routinely in use in many academic settings. Their use has been popularized because of evidence that they substantially reduce or prevent airborne transmission of microbial agents (Lipman et al., 1993) and minimize caretaker exposure to allergens (Reeb-Whitaker et al., 1999). However, this type of caging employs passive air exchange and is prone to accumulate CO2 and NH3, thereby requiring frequent sanitation and bedding changes (see Chapter 29). The recent large-scale introduction of individually ventilated cages obviate, to a large extent, the elevated levels of noxious gases. However, purchase of these systems requires substantial expense (see Chapter 21).",

He subsequently supplied animal breeders with this group of microorganisms. These defined bacteria included aerobic bacteria and some less oxygen-sensitive anaerobic organisms. The so-called extremely oxygen-sensitive (EOS) fusiform bacteria, which make up the majority of the normal microbiota of rodents, were not included, because of technical difficulties in isolation and cultivation. Of the defined microbiotas later used for gnotobiotic studies, the one known as the \u201cSchaedler flora\u201d was the most popular. In 1978, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) decided to revise the Schaedler flora, or \u201ccocktail\u201d consisting of eight bacteria, in order to standardize the microbiota used to colonize germfree rodents. The new defined microbiota, now known as the \u201caltered Schaedler flora\u201d (ASF), consisted of four members of the original Schaedler flora (two lactobacilli, Bacteroides distasonis, and the EOS fusiform bacterium), a spiral-shaped bacterium, and three new fusiform EOS bacteria.",

            "text": "It is difficult to monitor a gnotobiotic mouse colony with a defined microbiota. It is necessary to demonstrate that microorganisms of the specified microbiota are present and that adventitious microorganisms are absent. In the past, monitoring relied on bacterial morphology, limited evaluation of biochemical traits, and growth characteristics. Recently, the eight ASF strains were identified taxonomically by 16S rRNA sequence analysis (Dewhirst et al., 1999). Three strains were previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF 360), L. salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides distasonis (strain ASF 519), based on phenotypic criteria. 16S rRNA analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361 is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of L. murinis and L. animalis (both isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that clusters with L. acidophilus and L. lactis. Strain ASF 519 falls into an unnamed genus containing [Bacteroides] distasonis, [Bacteroides] merdae, [Bacteroides] forsythus, and CDC group DF-3. This unnamed genus is in the Cytophaga\u2013Flavobacterium\u2013Bacteroides phylum and is most closely related to the genus Porphyromonas. The spiral-shaped strain, strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum and exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson. The remaining four ASF strains, which are EOS fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low\u2013G+C content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Bacillus-Clostridium group) (Fig. 6\n). The 16S rRNA sequence information determined by Dewhirst et al. (1999) should allow rapid identification of ASF strains and should permit detailed analysis of the interactions of ASF organisms during development of intestinal disease in mice that are coinfected with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.",

The cortex is divided into B lymphocyte domains, called primary follicles, and T lymphocyte domains, known as the diffuse cortex. The mouse does not have palatine or pharyngeal tonsils. The spleen lies adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach. Different strains of mice have varying degrees of accessory splenic tissue. Age, strain, sex, and health status can affect the size, shape, and appearance of the spleen. Male spleens, for example, may be 50% larger than those of females. Most lymphocytes enter and leave the spleen in the bloodstream. The so-called white pulp of the spleen is organized along the central arteriole and is subdivided into T and B cell zones. The periarteriolar sheath is composed mainly of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and lymph follicles, which often contain germinal centers, are located at the periphery. The red pulp consists of sinusoids and hemoreticular tissue. Cellular and humoral components of immunity are distributed to the bloodstream and tissues by efferent lymphatic vessels and lymphatic ducts, which empty into the venous system.",

Thymectomy in adult mice produces no immediate effect, but several months later mice may develop a progressive decline of circulating lymphocytes and impaired cellular immune responses.

Pheromones have been divided into two broad categories: primer pheromones and releaser pheromones (Wilson, 1970). Primer pheromones are probably detected by the vomeronasal organs, which relay messages to the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in modulated behavior. Releaser pheromones trigger a prompt CNS-mediated behavioral response in a recipient. Pheromones most frequently affect developmental and reproductive processes. Primer pheromones produced by males also regulate the reproductive physiology of female mice (Keverne, 1998). More than one response can be elicited by the same pheromone. For example, small, structurally diverse ligands, which bind to the major urinary protein of male mice, demonstrate puberty-accelerated pheromone activity in recipient females. Four of these ligands have been implicated in estrus sychronization (Whitten effect). However, the same chemosensory substances now appear to be responsible for both sexual maturation and estrus cycling in female mice (Novotny et al., 1999). Pheromone communication must be accounted for in the management of mouse colonies, particularly when subtle behavioral traits or reproductive performance are critical (Ma et al., 1998).",

Dominant mice usually retain their whiskers\u2014hence the name barber mouse. Hair loss from barbering must be distinguished from hair loss due to ectoparasitism, microbial dermatitides, and abrasions from improperly designed cage covers. Maintenance behavior, such as eating and drinking, is cyclic and occurs mostly during the evening or at night.

This may make it difficult to determine whether a given gene product is directly involved or may be secondary to a more global dysregulation of the immune system. As with other biological systems, compensation mechanisms also may mask the phenotype.

Acute lethal infection occurs in genetically susceptible strains (Briody, 1959). Outbreaks among susceptible mice are often volatile, with variable morbidity and high mortality. Clinical signs such as ruffled fur or prostration, may occur for only a few hours before death. This rapidly fatal form is associated with multisystemic necrosis. Mice that survive acute infection can develop chronic disease characterized by a skin rash whose severity depends on the extent of viremia secondary to infection of parenchymal organs. The rash can develop anywhere on the body and may be focal or generalized (Fig. 12\n). Conjunctivitis also may occur.

Natural exposure is thought to occur through skin abrasions, but oral inoculation can cause chronic inapparent infection of Peyer's patches accompanied by prolonged excretion of virus in feces. Mice with chronic skin disease can transmit infection by contact and also are a source of contaminated tissues. Intranasal inoculation can produce necrotizing rhinitis and pneumonia in addition to systemic disease. However, cage-to-cage transmission of infection is low and can be virtually nil if cage bonnets are employed (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b). Ectromelia virus is highly stable at room temperature, especially under dry conditions, leading to the potential for prolonged environmental contamination in infected colonies (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987c). Aerogenic exposure is not a major factor in natural outbreaks, and arthropod-borne transmission does not appear to occur. However, intrauterine infection and fetal deaths have been reported.

Although virus excretion typically lasts for about 3 weeks, virus has been found in scabs and/or feces for up to 16 weeks. Resistant mouse strains also are dangerous because they can shed virus during asymptomatic infections. However, infections in resistant mice tend to be short-lived. Ironically, highly susceptible mice are a relatively small hazard for dissemination of infection, if properly discarded, because they die before virus shedding becomes prominent. Thus, the juxtaposition of enzootically infected and highly susceptible mice can provoke explosive outbreaks. Infant and aged mice are usually more susceptible to lethal infection than young adult mice. Maternal immunity among enzootically infected breeding mice may perpetuate infection by protecting young mice from death, but not from infection.

The resistance of rodent parvoviruses to environmental inactivation increases the risks of transmission after virus is excreted. Therefore, contamination of caging, bedding, food, and clothing must be considered a risk for the spread of infection. Transmission occurs by oronasal exposure, but viral contamination of biologicals used for experimental inoculation, such as transplantable tumors, also can be a source of infection. Continuous contact exposure to infected animals or soiled bedding usually induces a humoral immune response within 3 weeks, but limited exposure may delay seroconversion. Young mice in enzootically infected colonies are protected by maternal antibody, but actively acquired immunity develops from infection sustained after the decay of maternal immunity. MVM, in contrast to MPV, is not thought to cause persistent infection; infection in immunocompetent adult mice usually lasts less than 3 weeks (Smith, 1983b; Smith and Paturzo, 1988). Infection appears to last less than 1 month even in oronasally inoculated neonatal mice.

The virus grew lytically in a CD8+ T cell clone designated L3 and inhibited the proliferation of cloned T cells stimulated with antigen or interleukin 2 (IL-2). Additional isolates confirmed that these viruses are antigenically distinct from MVM. Thus, they constitute a second and distinct serogroup of murine parvoviruses. Molecular analysis of MPV indicates that regions encoding the NS proteins are similar to those of MVM, a finding that accounts for cross-reactivity between the viruses in generic serological tests. However, they differ significantly in regions encoding the capsid proteins, accounting for their antigenic specificity (Ball-Goodrich and Johnson, 1994). The prototype isolate was first called an \u201corphan\u201d parvovirus of mice because its biology and significance were obscure, but it has subsequently been named mouse parvovirus (MPV).

Exposure of neonatal mice also can result in viremic dissemination and high mortality. Additionally, survivors can be persistently infected and excrete virus from lung and kidney for months.

Natural infection in immunocompetent adult mice is usually self-limiting and asymptomatic. However, four basic patterns of clinical disease are recognized from study of experimentally induced infection (Fig. 21\n). (1) The cerebral form is characterized by illness in immunocompetent mice beginning 5\u20136 days after intracerebral inoculation of virus. Sudden death may result or subacute illness associated with one or more of the following signs may develop: ruffled fur, hunched posture, motionlessness, and neurological deficits. Mice suspended by the tail display coarse tremors of the head and extremities, culminating in clonic convulsions and tonic extension of the hindlegs. Spontaneous convulsions also can occur. Animals usually die or recover in several days. (2) A visceral form can occur in adult mice inoculated by peripheral routes with viscerotropic strains. It can be asymptomatic or lead to clinical signs, including ruffled fur, conjunctivitis, ascites, somnolescence, and death. If mice survive, recovery may take several weeks. (3) Runting and death from LCMV infection may occur in neonatally infected suckling mice and can lead to transient illness or to death. Clinical signs are nonspecific, recovery is slow, and survivors may remain runted. This early form of disease is attributed to endocrine dysfunction caused by LCMV infection. (4) Late-onset disease can occur in previously asymptomatic carrier mice that develop immune complex glomerulonephritis. It is usually the result of prenatal or neonatal infection and occurs in persistently infected mice when they are 9\u201312 months old. Clinical signs are nonspecific and include ruffled fur, hunched posture, weight loss, proteinuria, and ascites.",

            "text": "LCMV is distributed widely in wild mice in North and South America and in Europe and has recently been found in Australia (Smith et al., 1993). Among common laboratory species, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection, but only the mouse and the hamster are known to transmit virus. LCMV infection is not prevalent in laboratory mice produced and maintained in modern quarters. Infection is usually introduced through inoculation of virus-infected biologicals, such as transplantable tumors, or by feral mice. Wild mice are a natural reservoir of infection and a potential threat to research colonies if they gain entry inadvertently. Carrier mice usually develop as a result of asymptomatic prenatal or neonatal infection, which induces tolerance to the virus. Such mice can have persistently high concentrations of virus in many organs, thereby facilitating virus excretion in saliva, nasal secretions, and urine. Persistently infected neonates usually reach breeding age and can perpetuate infection in a breeding colony. Thus introduction of a single LCMV carrier mouse to a breeding colony can eventually result in a high prevalence of persistently infected mice. Infection in adult mice, by contrast, is often acute because of the onset of effective immunity, and the spread of virus is halted. Horizontal spread of infection is enhanced by close contact, but rapid horizontal spread is not characteristic. Mice can transmit LCMV to hamsters, which can remain viremic and \u201cviruric for many months even if they contract infection as adults. Infected hamsters can transmit virus to other hamsters and mice and are the primary source of human LCMV infection (see Chapter 5). Infected mice are not a significant source of human exposure. However, persistent infection in immunodeficient mice may carry greater risks for viral excretion and zoonotic transmission.",

However, lesions comparable to experimentally induced disease are rare during natural infection. Intracerebral inoculation of virus into immunocompetent adult mice can induce nonsuppurative leptomeningitis, choroiditis, and focal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Host tissues are damaged during the course of the cellular immune response to the virus. The character of visceral lesions depends on virus strain and mouse strain; the ratio of cytolytic to proliferative responses in lymphoid organs is mouse strain-dependent. In severe infection, nonsuppurative inflammation can occur in many tissues. The severity of accompanying cytolytic lesions seems to parallel the intensity of cellular immunity. Liver lesions can include hepatocytic necrosis accompanied by nodular infiltrates of lymphoid cells and Kupffer's cells, activated sinusoidal endothelium, an occasional granulocyte or megakaryocyte, and fatty metamorphosis. Cytolysis, cell proliferation, and fibrinoid necrosis can develop in lymphoid organs. Necrosis of cortical thymocytes can lead to thymic involution. Lesions of late-onset disease are characterized by formation of immune complexes and associated inflammation. Renal glomeruli and the choroid plexus are most severely affected, but complexes may also be trapped in synovial membranes, blood vessel walls, and skin. Lymphoid nodules can form in various organs. Lesions associated with early deaths in neonatally infected mice have not been thoroughly described but include hepatic necrosis.",

In adult mice with acute LCMV infection, virus multiplies in B cells and macrophages, whereas T cells are resistant. Internal viral epitopes induce humoral immune responses, but surface epitopes elicit cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibodies. Thus elimination of virus and virus-associated immunological injury are both T cell-mediated. This apparent paradox has been explained by the view that prompt cellular immunity limits viral replication and leads to host survival, whereas slower cellular immune responses permit viral spread and increase the number of virus-infected target cells subject to attack once immunity is fully developed. Antibody can be detected by 1 week after infection but does not play a significant role in eliciting acute disease. Lesions of LCMV infection appear to develop from direct T cell-mediated damage to virus-infected cells and may involve humoral factors released from immune effector T cells.

Whereas immunocompetent adult mice will normally seroconvert after exposure, carrier mice may develop poor humoral immune responses. Therefore, testing must avoid false negative results. Employment of adult contact sentinel mice is a useful strategy for detecting LCMV infection by seroconversion. Alternatively, small blood samples can be collected from persistently infected live suspects, which are often viremic, and used to inoculate cultured cells or adult and neonatal mice. Intracerebral inoculation of LCMV-positive tissues should elicit neurological signs in adult mice within 10 days, whereas infant mice should remain asmptomatic. Histological examination of brains from affected adults may reveal nonsuppurative inflammation, but lesions may be minimal in mice infected with viscerotropic isolates. Immunohistochemistry can be used to detect viral antigen in brains of suckling and adult mice. Intraperitoneal inoculation of adult mice may yield short-lived infection with seroconversion, i.e., the mouse antibody protection test. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay also is available (Park et al., 1997). Virus can be grown and quantified in several continuous cell lines, including mouse neuroblastoma (N-18) cells, BHK-21 cells, and L cells. Application of immunofluorescence staining to detect LCMV antigen in inoculated cultured cells yields results more quickly than animal inoculation. Of course, all diagnostic procedures involving potential contact with live virus should be carried out under strict containment conditions to avoid infection of laboratory personnel. The use of in vitro detection has the added advantage, in this regard, of reducing biohazardous exposure and the use of live animals for testing.",

Virus preferentially infects terminally differentiated enterocytes in the small and large intestine, which accounts for the age-related susceptibility to disease; the number of such cells decreases as the intestinal tract matures. Characteristic histological lesions are most easily discerned in the small intestine in mice less than 2 weeks old (Little and Shadduck, 1987). They consist of increased vacuolation of villar epithelial cells with cytoplasmic swelling, which give villi a clubbed appearance (Fig. 26\n).

Early clinical and laboratory investigations emphasized their potential to induce hepatitis, so their original designation, which is still used actively, is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Experience has shown, however, that hepatitis is not a common feature of natural infection in immunocompetent mice. Five prototype strains have received much attention from research scientists. They are: JHM (MHV4), MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-A59. However, numerous additional strains have since been identified that differ in virulence, tissue tropism, and antigenicity. This reflects the fact that mutation is common among coronaviruses, a property that increases risks for recurrent infection. As described further below, MHV isolates are often categorized according to their organotropism into two biotypes: enterotropic strains, which infect primarily the intestinal tract, and polytropic strains, which initially infect the respiratory tract but often progress to multisystemic dissemination (Homberger, 1997). However, isolates may contain features of both biotypes. Although MHV isolates and strains share internal antigens (M and N), they can be distinguished by neutralization tests that detect strain-specific spike (S) antigens. MHV shares antigens with the coronaviruses of rats, a finding that has been exploited to develop heterologous antigens for serological tests. MHV also is related to human corona-virus OC43.",

There are no reports of natural transmission from mice to other species, but suckling rats can develop necrotizing rhinitis after intranasal inoculation with MHV-S. Sex-related or seasonal differences in susceptibility have not been found. MHV should be considered highly contagious, with natural transmission occurring by respiratory or oral routes. Recent reports suggest that enterotropic biotypes predominate in natural infections (Homberger et al., 1998). Feces and nasopharyngeal exudates can serve as sources of infection.

Immune-mediated clearance of virus associated with seroconversion usually begins about a week after infection, and mice recover fully within 3\u20134 weeks. Humoral and cellular immunity appears to participate in host defenses to infection, and T cell-dependent immunity is an absolute requirement. Thus, age-related resistance to MHV correlates with maturation of lymphoreticular tissues. Enzootic infection had been construed to include persistent infection in individual mice. Current evidence suggests, however, that enzootic infection results either from the fresh and continuous introduction of immunologically naive or deficient mice or from the recurrent infection of immune mice with MHV variants that arise by natural mutation. Mutation is favored by immune pressures in enzootically infected colonies as well as missteps during natural replication, which include copying errors and recombination. Thus, mice that have developed immunity to one strain of MHV can remain susceptible to one or more genetically and antigenically divergent strains, resulting in reinfection (Barthold and Smith, 1989\na,b; Homberger et al., 1992). This caveat has practical importance for breeding colonies. Maternal immunity protects suckling mice against homologous MHV strains but not against antigenically variant strains. However, maternal immunity, even to homologous strains, depends on the presence of maternally acquired antibody in the lumen of the intestine. Therefore, the susceptibility of young mice increases significantly at weaning.",

However, genetic resistance also is virus strain-dependent. Therefore, mice resistant to one strain of MHV may be susceptible to another strain. It also is worth noting that the expanded use of genetically altered mice with novel or unanticipated deficits in antiviral responses may alter the outcome of virus-host interactions unpredictably.

Viremic dissemination can follow if virus gains access to regional blood vessels and lymphatics. Thus, viremia leads to secondary infection of vascular endothelium and parenchymal tissues in multiple organs including liver, brain, lymphoid organs, and other sites. Mice also may develop central nervous system disease by direct extension of infection from the olfactory mucosa along olfactory tracts. At necropsy, yellow-white foci indicative of necrosis can occur in multiple tissues, with the involvement of the liver as the classical lesion. Liver involvement may be accompanied by icterus and peritonitis. Histologically, necrosis can be focal or confluent and may be infiltrated by inflammatory cells (Fig. 29\n). Syncytia commonly form at the margin of necrotic areas and, in mild infections, may develop in the absence of frank necrosis. Syncytia formation is a hallmark of infection in many tissues, including intestine (Fig. 27), lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, brain, and bone marrow and in vascular endothelium in general. Although syncytia are transient in immunocompetent mice, they are a persistent feature in chronically infected, immunodeficient mice (Fig. 30\n). Neurotropic variants cause acute necrotizing encephalitis or meningoencephalitis in suckling mice, with demyelination in the brain stem and in peri-ependymal areas secondary to viral invasion of Oligodendroglia. Convalescent mice may have residual mononuclear cell infiltrates around vessels or as focal lesions in the liver. Immunodeficient mice can develop smoldering necrotic lesions in the liver and elsewhere. Compensatory splenomegaly may occur because of expansion of hematopoietic tissue.",

            "text": "Because MHV infection is usually asymptomatic, serological testing is the most reliable diagnostic tool. Many animal resources rely on sentinel mouse protocols for continuous serological surveillance, because immune dysfunction can delay or abrogate seroconversion among research mice. ELISA and IFA tests are well established, sensitive, and reliable (Smith, 1983a; Smith and Winograd, 1986). Neutralization tests are used to differentiate individual virus strains in the research laboratory but are problematic for routine use, because of cost, technical complexity, and the effects of natural antigenic mutation inherent to MHV. Additionally, strain-specific, serologic identification per se does not predict biological behavior, including virulence or tissue tropism. Serology also can be used in the context of mouse antibody production assays in which adult mice are inoculated with suspect tissues to elicit seroconversion. Molecular diagnostics are being applied more widely for the diagnosis of MHV infection. PCR protocols to detect virus in tissues or excreta are available (Casebolt, et al., 1997; Homberger et al., 1991; Yamada et al., 1993), and access to testing can be obtained from specialized laboratories. Clinical signs of diarrhea, acute death, or neurological deficits are suggestive but not pathognomonic. The detection of syncytia augmented, when possible, by immunohistochemistry to detect MHV antigens (Fig. 33\n) is a useful and practical means to confirm infection (Brownstein and Barthold, 1982). This strategy should attempt to select mice that are in early stages of infection, because necrosis in infant mice or seroconversion in older mice may reduce the chances of detecting syncytia or viral antigens. The option of using immunodeficient mice as sentinels can be considered, because they sustain prolonged infection. However, they should be securely confined because they also amplify virus loads. If properly controlled, amplification in immunodeficient mice can, however, facilitate subsequent virus isolation in tissue culture.",

            "text": "Control and prevention of MHV infection can be difficult because of the numerous variables that influence its expression. Perhaps the most important factor is the duration of infection in individual mice and in mouse colonies. There is evidence that infection in an individual immunocompetent mouse is acute and self-limiting. Such mice can be expected to develop immunity and eliminate virus within 30 days. Therefore, quarantine with the temporary cessation of breeding can be used effectively to eliminate infection (Weir et al., 1987). Additionally, maternally derived immunity can protect infant mice from infection until they are weaned and moved to uncontaminated quarters (Homberger, 1992; Lipman et al., 1987). Careful testing with sentinel mice should be used to assess the effectiveness of quarantine or \u201cnatural rederivation,\u201d as just described. This is especially true to account for the potential that a mutant variant could arise during quarantine and result in prolongation of colonywide infection. Immunodeficient mice, by contrast, are susceptible to chronic infection and viral excretion. Therefore, control measures must be more drastic and include depopulation. There also is an emerging gray zone, associated with the creation of genetically altered mice, in which decisions about control strategies are more problematic. It includes mice with unrecognized or unanticipated immune dysfunction or with selective immune dysfunction in which the impact of MHV infection is not known. Such colonies, which may contain highly valuable or irreplacable mice, may be rescued by cesarean rederivation or embryo transfer if vertical transmission of MHV infection is subsequently ruled out. Although rodent coronaviruses are not viable for extended periods in the environment, excreted virus may remain infectious for up to several days, so proper sanitation and disinfection of caging and animal quarters as well as stringent personal sanitation are essential to eliminate infection.",

For example, and apart from its clinical impact, MHV may stimulate or suppress immune responses, contaminate transplantable neoplasms, and be reactivated by treatment of asymptomatically infected animals with several classes of drugs, including immunosuppressive agents, and by intercurrent infections. It also can alter tissue enzyme levels. Additionally, the ubiquitous threat of MHV infection and uncertainty about its potential effects on a given research project provoke concerns that may exceed its true impact. For example, transient infection with a mild enterotropic strain is unlikely to disrupt systemic immune responses, whereas infection with a polytropic strain may be highly disruptive.

Ciliostasis, reduction in the number of cilia, and ultrastructural changes leading to cell death have also been described. Detrimental effects on ciliated epithelium can lead to disrupted mucociliary transport, which exacerbates pulmonary disease.",

Further, some mice may be poor responders and develop very low antibody titers. Therefore attempts should be made to use other methods to confirm diagnosis. Primary among these are attempts to isolate the causative organism. The upper respiratory tract should be cultured because it is a common site for natural infection. Buffered saline or Mycoplasma broth should be used to lavage the trachea, larynx, pharynx, and nasal passages. Culture from the genital tract is warranted if this site is suspected. Mycoplasma species may be difficult to grow, so it is prudent to confirm that the relevant expertise and quality control exist in the diagnostic laboratory. Speciation can be accomplished by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining or by growth inhibition. Immunohistochemistry should be considered to supplement basic histopathologic examination. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques are available to identify mycoplasmal antigens in tissue sections or in cytological preparations of tracheobronchial or genital tract lavages (Brunnert et al., 1994).

Tyzzer's disease occurs in many species of laboratory animals and in domestic and free-living species, but the reservoir of infection is unknown. Some strains appear capable of cross-infecting mice, rats, and hamsters, whereas others have a more restricted host range (Franklin et al., 1994). Therefore the risks for cross-infection depend on the strain causing a given outbreak. The vegetative form of C. piliforme is unstable, but spores can retain infectivity at room temperature for at least 1 year and should be viewed as the primary means of spread. Natural infection is probably due to ingestion of organisms, which are subsequently shed in feces. Feces-contaminated food and soiled bedding are therefore the most likely sources of environmental contamination. Prenatal infection can be induced by intravenous inoculation of pregnant mice, but its importance in the natural transmission of infection has not been determined.",

Hepatic necrosis also may occur adjacent to intralobular venules, which can contain microthrombi. Additionally, phlebitis may affect central veins. This lesion has been linked to the presence of organisms by silver stains and electron microscopy. Age-related hepatocytic proliferation can develop in infected livers, a response that is more pronounced in male mice than in female mice (Fox et al., 1996). This lesion may increase susceptibility to hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas among aged male A/JCr and B6C3F1 mice from infected colonies. An increased incidence of hepatic haemangiosarcomas also has been noted in H. hepaticus\u2013infected male B6C3F1 mice. In this context, A/JCr, C3H/HeNCr, and SJL/NCr mice are susceptible to hepatitis, whereas C57BL/6 mice are resistant (Ward et al., 1994). The finding of severe liver disease and tumor induction in B6C3F1 mice infected with H. hepaticus infers that genetic susceptibility to H. hepaticus\u2013induced neoplasia has a dominant pattern of inheritance. Recent studies with H. hepaticus in recombinant inbred mice also indicate that disease susceptibility has multigenetic properties (Hailey, 1998; Fox and Lee, 1997; Ihrig et al., 1999).",

This procedure requires suitable skill and experience to avoid technological pitfalls and should be performed by qualified laboratories. An IgG ELISA using outer membrane protein as the antigen shows promise for serological diagnosis. As noted above, helicobacters can be isolated on antibiotic-impregnated blood agar under microaerobic conditions and can then be speciated biochemically. Isolation of H. hepaticus from feces should be preceded by passing slurried samples through a 0.45 m filter before plating. If infection with larger helicobacters (H. bilis, \u201cH. rappini\u201d) is suspected, filtration at 0.65 \u03bcm is preferred. Helicobacters grow slowly and require prolonged incubation of cultures (up to 3 weeks) before they can be deemed negative. Signs (rectal prolapse) and lesions (hepatitis, typhlocolitis), depending on host genotype, can be suggestive of infection. Histopathological examination should include silver stains, especially of liver, to attempt to visualize spiral or curved organisms (Fox and Lee, 1997).",

This strategy requires repeated daily gavage rather than administration in drinking water, but it has successfully eliminated H. hepaticus from naturally infected mice. Wide-scale, eradication of enzootic helicobacteriosis can be expensive and time-consuming, without guarantee of success.

By contrast, infection should be avoided in immunodeficient mice, including genetically engineered mice with targeted or serendipitous immune dysfunction. Lastly, the outcome of opportunistic helicobacteriosis has not been thoroughly examined.

These occur as firm, raised nodules in the inguinal region or at the base of the penis and may rupture to spread infection to surrounding tissues.

Age may also influence susceptibility, with young mice being more susceptible than adults. Immunodeficient mice (e.g., athymic mice) contaminated with staphylococci often develop abscesses or furunculosis (Fig. 43\n). As noted above, behavioral dysfunction resulting in self-mutilation, including scratching and trichotillomania, is a likely predisposing factor. Once virulent staphylococci contaminate the environment, colonization of the gastrointestinal tract can occur and produce a carrier state. Phage typing can help to determine the source of infection.

Diagnosis depends on effective specimen collection. Hairs should be selected from the periphery of the lesion, and hairless skin should be scraped deeply to obtain diagnostic specimens. Trichophyton mentagrophytes rarely fluoresces under ultraviolet light, and hyphae must be differentiated from bedding fibers, food particles, and epidermal debris. Histological sections should be stained with a silver stain or Schiff's reagent to reveal organisms. Trichophyton also can be cultured on Sabouraud's agar. Plates are incubated at room temperature (22\u00b0\u201330\u00b0C), and growth is observed at 5\u201310 days.",

A recent national survey revealed that more than 30% of barrier colonies and about 70% of conventional colonies were affected (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997). The epizootiological impact of pinworm infestation is increased by the airborne dissemination of eggs, which can remain infectious even after drying. The life cycle is direct and completed in 11\u201315 days. Females deposit their eggs on the skin and hairs of the perianal region. Ingested eggs liberate larvae in the small intestine, and they migrate to the cecum within 24 hr. Worms remain in the cecum for 10\u201311 days, where they mature and mate. The females then migrate to the large intestine to deposit their eggs as they leave the host. There is unconfirmed speculation that larvae may reenter the rectum. Infestation usually begins in young mice and can recur, but adult mice tend to be more resistant. Syphacia infestation often occurs in combination with Aspicularis tetraptera. Because the life cycle of Syphacia is much shorter than that of Aspicularis, the number of mice that are apt to be infected with S. obvelata is correspondingly greater. There is evidence that resistance to infestation may be mouse strain-specific (Derothe et al., 1997).",

Alternatively, recently euthanized mice can be placed on a black paper, and double-sided cellophane tape can be used to line the perimeter to contain the parasites. As the carcass cools, parasites will vacate the pelage and crawl onto the paper. Sealed petri dishes can also be used. Cellophane tape also can be pressed against areas of the pelt of freshly euthanatized mice and examined microscopically. Skin scrapings made with a scalpel blade can be macerated in 10% KOH/glycerin or immersion oil and examined microscopically. This method has the disadvantage of missing highly motile species and low-level populations of slower-moving immature forms.

Histiocytic sarcomas correspond to the older Dunn classification as type A sarcomas and are composed primarily of reticulum cells. The tumor typically causes splenomegaly and nodular lesions in other organs, including liver, lung, kidney, and the female reproductive tract. Follicular center cell lymphomas correspond to Dunn type B sarcomas. They originate from B cell regions (germinal centers) of peripheral lymphoid tissues, including spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. Typical tumor cells have large vesiculated, folded, or cleaved nuclei and ill-defined cytoplasmic borders. Tumors also often contain small lymphocytes. Type C reticulum cell tumors often involve one or several lymph nodes rather than assuming a wide distribution. They consist of reticulum cells with a prominent component of well-differentiated lymphocytes.",

These two types are locally invasive and may metastasize to the lungs. Type C tumors are rare and are characterized by multiple cysts lined by low cuboidal to squamous epithelial cells, and they have abundant stroma.
