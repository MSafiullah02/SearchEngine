The evaluation of a commercial recombinant nucleocapsid proteinbased microtitre plate enzyme immunoassay, ELISARS TM is described. The results on 150 sera from SARS patients and 450 sera from non-SARS controls showed that this assay had a high level of sensitivity (96.2% for late serum samples) and specificity (97.8%). The performance and setup of this assay fulfills the requirement as a screening test for large-scale studies. A vast majority of SARS patients developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. In some patients (10/45), a high level of anti-nucleocapsid antibody appeared very early in the course of the illness. In contrast, a minority (4 of 105 patients) never developed these antibodies. The implication of differences in antibody response to the nucleocapsid protein deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "In March 2003, a global alert was raised by a newly recognized infectious disease, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which was later identified to be caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) not observed previously in humans Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003a] . This novel coronavirus has clinical and epidemiological characteristics distinct from the known human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 [Lee et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b; Rainer, 2004] . Although research on SARS-CoV has been progressing very rapidly, a substantial body of knowledge is still missing. To this end, high throughput assays for large-scale sero-epidemiological studies are needed. Recent studies have shown that the nucleocapsid protein reacted to a large proportion of sera collected from SARS patients, and with a sensitivity of upto 100% has been reported for enzyme immunoassays based on the nucleocapsid protein [Wang et al., 2003; Timani et al., 2004] . However, the specificity of nucleocapsid protein-based assays is still unknown. Here, we report on the evaluation of a commercially available assay, ELISARS TM (IgGENE, Hong Kong) for the detection of anti-SARS CoV-immunoglobulin (Ig) G from human serum samples.",

Briefly, serum samples were added to the antigen-coated wells of the microtitre plate, after an incubation step, the wells were washed, followed by the addition of anti-human IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After a second wash, 3,3 0 , 5,5 0tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added as a substrate for color development. The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm. Results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's criteria. Specimens with an OD reading \u00bc 0.5 were considered negative, whereas specimens with an OD reading >0.5 were considered positive. The cut-off value of 0.5 was according to the manufacturer's recommendation.",

A highly sensitive and specific assay with a high throughput capacity is required for this purpose. In this study, it was found that the recombinant nucleocapsid proteinbased microtitre plate EIA, ELISARS TM (IgGENE), provided a high degree of sensitivity (96.2% for late serum samples) and specificity (97.8%) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody from human serum samples. Thus, ELISARS TM (IgGENE) fulfills the criteria to be a screening assay for large-scale studies. The good performance of ELISARS TM is in line with those reported for other nucleocapsid protein-based assays [Shi et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2004; Guan et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2004a,b] , indicating the nucleocapsid protein is a promising target for the development of serological assays for SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "When compared to IFA, ELISARS TM (IgGENE) was less sensitive in early samples as 28.2% of the EIAnegative specimens were tested positive by IFA. However, it is worth noting that one of the IFA-negative specimens showed a high OD reading when tested by ELISARS TM (IgGENE), suggesting that the recombinant nucleocapsid proteins used in the ELISARS TM (IgGENE) were able to detect a fraction of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies that were not revealed by the IFA. These antibodies might target epitopes that were not exposed in the acetone-fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells that were used for IFA. Of the 61 samples with high IFA titres (\u00bc1:640), 3 were tested negative by the ELI-SARS TM (IgGENE). This observation is in line with the hypothesis that the recombinant nucleocapsid proteinbased assay is detecting a different spectrum of antibodies. Thus, the sensitivity may be increased by using a combination of assays in particular when applied to the early stage of infection. The majority (101/105, 96.2%) of SARS patients developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein after 3 weeks of onset of fever, and a small portion (10/45, 22.2%) had these antibodies developed within the first 2 weeks. On the other hand, a small fraction of patients (4/105, 3.8%) never developed these antibodies. Understanding the implication of differences in antibody response to the nucleocapsid protein is important for the development of nucleocapsid proteinor sequences-based vaccines which is in progress [Kim et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004] . An attempt was made to investigate whether the ELISARS TM (IgGENE) assay can be applied for IgM antibody detection. Only 10.8% of early samples, and 61.5% of late samples were found positive for anti-SARS-CoV IgM, indicating that the recombinant nucleocapsid proteins used were suboptimal for anti-SARS-CoV IgM detection.",

This is important, as the currently available viral RNA and virus isolation system are not perfect in terms of sensitivity Chen et al., 2004] . In this regard, the IFA is still more superior as it provides an overall higher sensitivity and can detect anti-SARS-CoV antibody at an earlier stage. However, the preparation of IFA requires handling of a high concentration of infectious viruses where high containment facilities are required. Further studies to develop a reliable IgM assay is urgently needed to improve the diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV infection.",
