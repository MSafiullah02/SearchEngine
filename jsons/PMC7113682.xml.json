The Coronaviridae currently contains the Torovirinae and Coronavirinae lineages, though analysis of recently reported divergent toro-like viruses suggests that the Torovirinae may be better represented as an independent family in the Nidovirales (Stenglein et al., 2014). The Coronavirinae currently contains four genera \u2013 Alpha- and Betacoronavirus that infect mammals, and Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus that infect birds and mammals.",

            "text": "Members of the Nidovirales infect metazoan hosts, have several replicative genes in common (Lauber et al., 2013), express their structural genes via subgenomic mRNAs which usually join sequences from both genomic termini (Sawicki et al., 2007), express their replicases as polyproteins via a ribosomal frameshift, and replicate in association with viral transmembrane proteins on intracellular paired membranes (reviewed in (V'Kovski et al., 2015)). Coronavirus growth is accompanied by a variety of intracellular membrane rearrangements, as illustrated for the coronavirus Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in Fig. 1\n. Regions of these paired-membrane structures have been given a variety of names in the literature, including double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes, spherules, zippered endoplasmic reticulum, but it is not clear whether the different parts of the organelle have different functions. Furthermore, recent studies (Al-Mulla et al., 2014, Maier et al., 2016) suggest that there may be considerable plasticity and overlap among coronavirus paired membrane replicative structures. For this reason, it seems preferable to break with past practice of focussing on double-membrane vesicles in particular, to consider the double-membrane organelle (DMO) as a whole. The term DMO encompasses DMVs as well as all of the other associated paired-membrane structures like convoluted membranes and spherules that make up the viral replicative organelle. The term DMO will be used throughout this review except when specifically referring to the DMV component of the replicative organelle. This review summarizes what we know about coronavirus DMOs, and what bioinformatics can tell us about DMO-making proteins.",

            "text": "Membrane-bound replicative organelles are a widespread but not universal intracellular feature associated with positive-strand RNA virus replication (Neuman et al., 2014a). Coronaviruses form a double-membrane organelle (DMO) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that contains viral RNA and replicase proteins (Deming et al., 2007, Hagemeijer et al., 2010, Oostra et al., 2007, Reggiori et al., 2010, Shi et al., 1999, van der Meer et al., 1999). In the DMO, two lipid bilayers are held at a constant distance of about 20 nm (Angelini et al., 2013). Electron microscopy and tomography studies have revealed that the replicative organelles of coronaviruses and the related arteriviruses are drawn from a repertoire of paired-membranes, including open-ended spherules, closed double-membrane vesicles, and both planar and convoluted paired membranes (Knoops et al., 2008, Knoops et al., 2012, Maier et al., 2013). Nonstructural proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are required to form structures similar to the DMOs observed in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected cells (Angelini et al., 2013). And since protease domains of nsp5 are required to release nsp4 and nsp6 from the polyprotein precursor, the region from nsp3 to nsp6 can collectively be thought of as the DMO-forming apparatus of coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison of domain architecture can be taken as evidence of homology of the coronavirus DMO-making proteins across the Nidovirales (Fig. 2\n).",

            "text": "The formation of paired membranes probably involves interactions on both sides of the membrane, and perhaps within the membrane, and a few of these interactions have been confirmed biochemically. SARS-CoV nsp3-nsp3 interactions have been detected in cells by yeast two-hybridization (Pan et al., 2008) and GST pulldown (Imbert et al., 2008), and in purified protein by perfluorooctanoic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Neuman et al., 2008). While SARS-CoV nsp4-nsp4 interactions were not found in yeast-two hybrid or mammalian two-hybrid screens (Pan et al., 2008, von Brunn et al., 2007) studies with MHV did detect nsp4-nsp4 interactions by Venus reporter fluorescence (Hagemeijer et al., 2011). To date, homotypic interactions have not been demonstrated for nsp6 despite several attempts (Imbert et al., 2008, Pan et al., 2008, von Brunn et al., 2007). Heterotypic interactions between coronavirus nsp3 and nsp4 have been observed by mammalian two-hybridization (Pan et al., 2008) and Venus reporter fluorescence (Hagemeijer et al., 2011), although because of differences in the parts of nsp3 that were used, these may actually represent two distinct modes of interaction between nsp3 and nsp4. Nsp4-nsp6 interaction has been demonstrated by Venus reporter fluorescence (Hagemeijer et al., 2011) and indirectly because co-expression of nsp4 abrogates vesicle accumulation due to expression of nsp6 (Angelini et al., 2013). Each of these proteins also potentially interacts with host proteins, which may have a downstream effect on pathogenesis (Pfefferle et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 produces large areas of paired membranes, apparently arranged in parallel tubes (Angelini et al., 2013, Hagemeijer et al., 2014). In terms of topology, nsp3-4 membrane pairing involves linking opposite sides of the ER across the ER lumen, so it is likely that the luminal domains of both proteins are involved in this interaction. Membrane pairing would not necessarily need to involve high-affinity interactions, as demonstrated by a study where paired membranes were induced by low-affinity interactions between membrane-linked green fluorescent protein (Snapp et al., 2003). The minimal requirements for DMO-like membrane pairing appear to be the C-terminal region of nsp3 that contains both transmembrane regions and the luminal ectodomain (Hagemeijer et al., 2014), and at least the N-terminal region of nsp4 including the first three transmembrane regions of nsp4 (Sparks et al., 2007). Mutations in the glycosylated luminal domain of nsp4 result in either non-recoverable virus or less consistent membrane pairing (Gadlage et al., 2010). While the final transmembrane C-terminal cytosolic domain of nsp4 is dispensible for coronavirus replication (Sparks et al., 2007), it is not clear whether partial deletion of nsp4 affects DMO structure. These observations together suggest that coronavirus membranes most likely pair through heterotypic interactions involving the luminal domains of nsp3 and nsp4, though interactions between cytosolic domains that lead to nsp3 and nsp4 clustering may also be important for membrane pairing.",

The ERAD tuning pathway is modulated by stress-inducible positive regulators of protein disposal such as EDEM1 (ER degradation-enhancing alpha mannosidase-like 1) and OS-9 (osteosarcoma amplified 9), which assist in transporting misfolded proteins into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Under physiological conditions, low concentrations of EDEM1 and OS-9 are maintained in the ER lumen in order to avoid premature degradation of proteins that are in the process of folding (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008). In this case, EDEM1 and OS-9 are selectively confined by interacting with the transmembrane-anchored cargo receptor SEL1L (suppressor of lin-12-like) and later released from the ER lumen in small short-lived vesicles, called EDEMosomes, which rapidly fuse with the endolysosomal compartments (Bernasconi et al., 2012). In infected cells, viral double-stranded RNA colocalizes with EDEM1, OS-9, SEL1L and LC3-I, which is recruited to autophagosomes. Moreover, replication of MHV, which does not require an intact autophagy pathway, is impaired upon knockdown of LC3 or SEL1L (Bernasconi et al., 2012). Taken together, this is evidence that MHV exploits the ERAD-tuning machinery to establish DMOs for replication. A summary of nsp3-6 interactions and induced membrane rearrangements is shown in Fig. 3\n.",

Several of these domains are duplicated, including two ubiquitin-like domains Ub1 and Ub2, two PLpro, and three macrodomains (Mac1, Mac2 and Mac3). Ten of these domains form the core of coronavirus nsp3, and are found in every currently known coronavirus, including both ubiquitin-like domains, the second PLpro, the first macrodomain Mac1, a hypervariable region consisting of mostly acidic residues, and a region including the transmembrane regions TM1 and TM2, nsp3 ectodomain (3Ecto), a nidovirus-conserved domain of unknown function (Y) and a region predicted to contain two structural domains which are only found in coronaviruses (CoV\u2014Y). Six of the ten domains conserved in all coronaviruses are also found in other members of the Nidovirales, with evidence that the region from TM1 to Y is present in all nidoviruses except the two families that infect arthropods, namely the Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae (V'Kovski et al., 2015).",

Among the closest structural matches to SARS-CoV Ub1 is one of the ubiquitin-like domains of ISG15, an interferon-induced protein constitutively present in higher eukaryotes. This has led to speculation that Ub1 may be involved in modulating the effects of intracellular immunity in a manner analogous to the immunomodulatory decoys of poxviruses (Johnston and McFadden, 2003). Some viruses have developed a mechanism to avoid the expression of ISG15. For example, Influenza B virus blocks its expression by means of NS1 protein in order to overcome the immune response. The PL2pro domain of SARS-CoV nsp3 also recognizes and cleaves ISG15 (Lindner et al., 2007), which could potentially modulate the intracellular response to infection (Morales et al., 2015). However, the comparison with ISG15 remains speculative because an immunomodulatory function for Ub1 has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. It is known that ISG15 is able to inhibit virus replication by abrogating nuclear processing of unspliced viral RNA precursors. However, some viruses have developed a mechanism to avoid the expression of ISG15. For example, influenza B virus blocks its expression by means of NS1 protein in order to overcome the immune response. It is possible that the PL2pro domain of nsp3 may also bind ISG15 and modulate the intracellular response to infection (Morales et al., 2015).

This domain was originally called an X-domain (Gorbalenya et al., 1991), an alternate name that is still used in some publications. The structure of Mac1 has been solved for several coronaviruses (Piotrowski et al., 2009, Saikatendu et al., 2005, Tan et al., 2009, Wojdyla et al., 2009, Xu et al., 2009). Purified SARS-CoV Mac1 was shown to have relatively weak ADP ribose 1\u2033 phosphatase (ADRP) activity (Saikatendu et al., 2005). Enzymatic activity of Mac1 was predicted to be due to His45 based on comparison with the homologous protein from yeast Ymx7, Archaeoglobus fulgidus AF1521 and Er58 from E. coli. The active site was verified by site directed mutagenesis data in the Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) Mac1, which suggested that the corresponding residues Asn37, Asn40, His45, Gly44 and Gly48 of SARS-CoV Mac1 are part of the active site (Putics et al., 2005). Both the SARS-CoV ADRP and the HCoV-229E counterpart dephosphorylate ADP ribose 1\u2018\u2019 phosphate to ADP-ribose in a highly specific manner, the enzyme having no detectable activity on several other nucleoside phosphates (Putics et al., 2005). Characterization of an ADP ribose 1\u2033phosphatase-deficient HCoV-229E mutant revealed no significant effects on viral RNA synthesis and virus titer (Putics et al., 2005), but mutation of the Mac1 active site altered MHV pathogenicity, suggesting that this domain may play an immunomodulatory role by interacting with unknown host factors (Kuri et al., 2011).",

Egloff et al. suggested that Mac1 may primarily be a poly-ADP-ribose binding (PAR-binding) module, rather than an ADP-ribose cleaving enzyme (Egloff et al., 2006). PARylation occurs when PAR polymerases are activated, often in compromised cells, to trigger apoptosis or DNA repair. Perhaps more relevant to coronavirus infection, the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules, which are aggregates of cellular stalled translation complexes, appears to be regulated by PARylation (Leung, 2014). Further research is needed to determine whether coronavirus ADRP expression affects RNA granule formation or stability. However, the Infectious bronchitis virus Mac1 does not have detectable ADP-ribose binding activity suggesting that Mac1 domains may have other important functions that are unrelated to ADP-ribose (Piotrowski et al., 2009).",

However, in light of more recent structural evidence that the SUD contains not one but three distinct structural domains, and phylogenetic evidence that some SUD domains are not unique to SARS-CoV, a revision to the name of this region is necessary (Chen et al., 2015). This region was originally divided into N-terminal and middle domains, which appear in the literature as SUD-N, SUD-M, but are here renamed as Mac2 and Mac3 to reflect their conservation outside SARS-CoV, followed by a small C-terminal domain known as DPUP for its position as the Domain Preceding Ub2 and PL2pro. The structure of both Mac2 and Mac3 is a close structural match for the SARS-CoV Mac1 domain despite a lack of detectable amino acid homology between these proteins (Tan et al., 2009). The presence of these additional macrodomain folds has also been confirmed by the NMR structure of the complete Mac2-Mac3-DPUP (Johnson et al., 2010) and the NMR structure of SUD-M (Chatterjee et al., 2009). The SARS-CoV DPUP domain contains a novel fold that consists of an antiparallel beta sheet (Johnson et al., 2010) that was surprisingly also found in the corresponding region of MHV despite negligible evidence of homology based on alignment of amino acid sequences (Chen et al., 2015).",

Notably, while Mac2 and Mac3 domains bear a close structural resemblance to the SARS-CoV Mac1 ADRP domain, neither domain has any demonstrable affinity for ADP-ribose (Tan et al., 2009). The amino acid residues responsible for Mac3 and DPUP RNA binding have been mapped, and appear to fall near the region of Mac3 that corresponds to the active site in the structurally similar Mac1 domain (Chatterjee et al., 2009). Together this suggests that the cluster of three macrodomains in SARS-CoV nsp3 arose through gene duplication and that additional macrodomains may contribute to the function of nsp3 as an accessory to the viral replication process (Neuman et al., 2008). Interestingly, in the context of a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, Mac1 and Mac2 were dispensable but Mac3 was essential for RNA replication (Kusov et al., 2015).",

However, another important role for SARS-CoV PL2pro may be linked to its deubiquitinating activity; it efficiently disassembles diubiquitin and branched polyubiquitin chains, cleaves 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-conjugated ubiquitin substrates, and has de-ISGylating activity (Chen et al., 2007, Lindner et al., 2005). Thus, PL2pro may have critical roles not only in proteolytic processing of the replicase complex but also in subverting cellular ubiquitination machinery to facilitate viral replication (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014, Mielech et al., 2014, Mielech et al., 2015), as demonstrated for the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (van Kasteren et al., 2013).",

Two beta-hairpins at the fingertips region contain four cysteine residues, which coordinate a zinc ion. Mutational analysis of the zinc-coordinating cysteines of SARS-CoV PLpro showed that zinc-binding ability is essential for structural integrity and protease activity (Barretto et al., 2005). PL2pro has several structural homologues from the cysteine protease superfamily that are cellular deubiquitinating enzymes. The active site of PLpro consists of a catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues, consistent with catalytic triads found in many PLpro domains. Comparison of the SARS-CoV PL2pro structure with the structure of TGEV PL1pro demonstrates that the coronavirus-like PLpro folds have a common architecture (Wojdyla et al., 2010), and likely arose through gene duplication.",

The C-terminal portion of nsp3 has been shown to change the localization of nsp4 (Hagemeijer et al., 2011), and cause a membrane proliferation phenotype in transfected cells (Angelini et al., 2013). The topology of nsp3 leaves only one domain, annotated here as the ectodomain of nsp3, or 3Ecto, on the luminal side of the membrane. If nsp3 participates directly in the membrane pairing exhibited in cells transfected with SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 (Angelini et al., 2013), then the 3Ecto domain likely helps mediate membrane pairing directly. We previously noted that a cluster of cysteine and histidine residues in 3Ecto may coordinate a metal ion, but analysis of newly sequenced viruses shows that the Cys-His cluster is not conserved in all coronaviruses, hence this domain has been renamed in the annotation presented here.",

            "text": "As part of its proteolytic activity, Mpro is destined to interact with all the non-structural proteins from nsp4 to nsp16, presumably near its catalytic site. Interestingly, comparison of all the known sites where mutation can lead to a temperature-sensitive, RNA-negative phenotype suggests a close connection to Mpro (Fig. 7\n). To date, the only proteins where temperature-sensitive mutations have been discovered are nsp3, nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp14 and nsp16 (Al-Mulla et al., 2014, Sawicki et al., 2005, Stokes et al., 2010), all of which make fewer or smaller DMVs compared to wild-type virus (Al-Mulla et al., 2014). Nsp10 interacts with nsp5 directly (Imbert et al., 2008), and both nsp10 and nsp3 mutations paradoxically inhibit Mpro activity (Donaldson et al., 2007, Stokes et al., 2010). One interactome study showed that nsp12 and nsp14 also directly interact with nsp5 (Pan et al., 2008), and nsp14 and 16 would also indirectly interact with nsp5 as part of the nsp10-14-16 complex (Bouvet et al., 2010, Decroly et al., 2011, Imbert et al., 2008, Pan et al., 2008). Together this suggests that nsp5 plays a critical role in both RNA replication and DMV formation, likely by proteolytically releasing nsp4 and nsp6.",

The presence of additional non-transmembrane hydrophobic domains near authentic transmembrane domains is a common theme running through the DMO making proteins. IBV and SARS-CoV nsp6 have been shown to activate autophagy, inducing vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II (Cottam et al., 2011).

K22 showed antiviral effects in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range, requiring higher amounts to achieve an antiviral effect than would normally be considered practical for wider clinical use. Time of addition and removal studies showed that K22 was most effective early in infection, after entry, consistent with effects on establishment of viral replication complexes or direct interference with the process of RNA replication (Lundin et al., 2014). Surprisingly, two independently isolated resistance mutations mapped to opposite ends of transmembrane helices in nsp6 at positions H121L and M159V. The resistant viruses released similar amounts of new progeny compared to wt, but produced only about half as many DMVs per infected cell, confirming the importance of nsp6 for authentic DMV formation. In addition, the DMVs induced by resistance mutants appeared structurally impaired. Similarly to MHV nsp4 mutants (Beachboard et al., 2015, Gadlage et al., 2010), K22 escape mutants induced DMV with partially collapsed inner membranes, even when K22 was not present. Moreover, the specific infectivity of those newly released virions was about ten-fold lower for nsp6 mutants than for wt. This suggested that the mutations in nsp6 conferred resistance to K22 at a cost of impairing an early intracellular step in the establishment of infection.",

Mutations in nsp4 of MHV resulted in decreased replication and competitive fitness (Beachboard et al., 2015). MHV mutants that produced fewer DMVs, but equal or greater amounts of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA have been described (Al-Mulla et al., 2014), suggesting that coronavirus replication is not strictly dependent on high numbers of DMVs or the size of the DMV interior. Notably, when equal infectivities of two viruses were added to the same flask at a temperature where both viruses could grow normally, several mutants with small DMV and low-DMV phenotypes did not appear to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to wild-type virus (Al-Mulla et al., 2014). This result was replicated in several continuous cell lines and primary cells. Furthermore, a survey of Infectious bronchitis virus revealed that one high-pathogenicity strain produced abnormally low numbers of double-membrane spherules, while still producing an equivalent amount of RNA to a vaccine strain (Maier et al., 2016). These results suggest that whatever their purpose, coronavirus replicative organelles display a surprising degree of structural plasticity without necessarily impairing RNA production, pathogenicity or competitive fitness.",

Structures that were solved at the time of domain assignment are shown in red, and domain assignments based on amino acid alignments are shown in grey. (B) Annotation of nsp4-6 domains following the style of Fig. 4. Domain designations include nsp4 transmembrane regions (TM1, TM2-4), ectodomain (4Ecto) and endodomain (4Endo); nsp5 catalytic domains (Dom I and II) and dimerization domain (Dom III); and nsp6 transmembrane regions (TM1-4, TM5, TM6), ectodomain (6Ecto) and endodomain (6Endo). (C) Grey boxes show regions of apparent homology between coronavirus nsp4-6 and the equivalent proteins of Arteriviridae (Arteri), Mesoniviridae (Mesoni), Torovirinae (Toro), and Roniviridae (Roni). Regions of questionable homology based on predicted transmembrane regions or predicted protein secondary structure are marked with a question mark.",
