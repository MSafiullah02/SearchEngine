Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with 25,616 and 15,632 probable or confirmed cases reported in 2005 and 2006, respectively [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Among the reportable bacterial vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States with universal childhood vaccination, pertussis is the least well controlled [1]. Pertussis also remains a substantial public health problem in other developed regions, such as the European Union and Canada [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Studies suggest that there are approximately 48.5 million annual cases of pertussis worldwide, with 295,000 deaths [11], [12], [13]. However, the total burden of pertussis is likely underestimated, especially among adolescents and adults, in whom typical pertussis symptoms are often absent making diagnosis difficult [1], [2], [4], [12], [13], [14], [15].",

Serologic testing with B. pertussis antigens, pertussis toxin (PT) in particular, can be sensitive and specific, but the tests are not widely available, have not been fully standardized and no universally accepted serologic correlates for protection are available [25], [26], [27], [28].",

Discussion included the possibility that in some instances genetic change in the pertussis organism may have contributed to increases.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed on sera from more than 6000 US residents aged 6\u201349 years.

An anti-PT IgG level of \u226594 EU was proposed as the diagnostic cutoff point in subjects 10 years of age and older. Application of this cutoff point to culture-confirmed illness yielded a high diagnostic sensitivity (80%) and specificity (93%). Anti-PT IgG assays with a single serum sample appeared to be useful for identification of recent B. pertussis infection in adolescents and adults.

The laboratories employed a variety of procedures, antigens, conjugates and other reagents, and calculation methods. Results indicated an overall consistency among the laboratories. A reasonable quantitative agreement was achieved among the 19 laboratories with assays calibrated using the US reference pertussis antisera. This agreement demonstrated that use of a common reference serum had been successful at harmonizing results. To promote a higher level of international standardization of pertussis immunoassays, the highest priority recommendations would be to improve the availability of reference reagents and methods, including international reference sera, a proficiency panel of well-characterized sera, and well-characterized antigens.",

Reference sera from the United States (US reference pertussis antiserum [human] lot 3 and lot 4 for IgG-antibodies and lot 5 for IgA-antibodies) were prepared by FDA, CBER more than 10 years ago, and since then have been commonly used as reference standards for pertussis serologic assays [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63]. Currently, only limited quantities of these sera remain. With an increasing number of vaccine and diagnostic studies, more widely available international standard preparation(s) are needed. The WHO Ad Hoc Pertussis Working Group recommended the preparation and standardization of an international human reference antiserum to pertussis antigens to replace the current widely used CBER preparations before the supply is exhausted [64]. It was agreed that as far as possible, continuity with the existing CBER reference preparations should be maintained. These new international reference materials were intended for the following uses: (1) vaccine studies of products in current distribution, as well as those under development; (2) studies of serologic responses to infection; (3) epidemiologic surveillance; (4) future assessment of antibodies to other antigens apart from PT, FHA and PRN; and (5) evaluation of new generation vaccines.",

Therefore, it was suggested that nonvaccine antigens may not be as good as PT for serologic diagnosis of pertussis in vaccinated populations. Other points of discussion included the potential use of reverse vaccinology approach to identify new antigen candidates to be used in serologic diagnostics and lack of specificity of other antigens other than PT, such as FHA and ACT. The lack of sensitivity and specificity of commercial tests currently available worldwide was broadly discussed. It was pointed out that one commercial IgG and IgA anti-PT test available in the United States has been standardized to provide adequate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pertussis in persons older than 10 years of age.",

In addition, the predefined criteria for noninferiority might be met for one or more, but not all immunologic parameters, with unknown implications for protection. Because of these uncertainties, the overall judgment of the likely protective efficacy of an aP-containing vaccine should take into account all aspects of immune responses.

The DTaP efficacy trials have been contradictory with regard to the efficacy of DTaP2 (PT + FHA without PRN). Initially the efficacy of DTaP2 was reported to be 85% in Senegal, according to WHO criteria, but this was later corrected to 74% since the original diagnostic criteria were different from other trials [90]. This 74% efficacy of DTaP2 in Senegal probably is similar to the 59% efficacy observed with another DTaP2 in Sweden because of the finding that PT immune responses in Senegal are more than 1.5 times higher than in Western Europe [91]. In conclusion, DTwP and DTaP with \u22653 components are the preferred options for immunization against whooping cough. DTaP5 has demonstrated efficacy comparable with DTaP3, although it is uncertain if FIM3 is a protective antigen [92]. The duration of protection with DTwP and DTaP can be estimated at 6 years or more [93]. To further control pertussis in newborns, adolescents and adults, DTaP booster immunizations can be recommended [8].",

Key reagents are qualified and standardized, coating antigens are highly purified and assessed both by physical chemistry and immunologic methods to ensure purity, antigenicity, and specificity. Assay reference sera are bridged to international references, and the performance has demonstrated to remain stable. Control sera are shown to be specific and represent suitable ranges across the range of the assay. All components are qualified, with performance panels of sera to ensure consistency. All assays have been fully validated by precision (inter- and intralaboratory), accuracy (using spike recovery), specificity (assessing matrix effects and performing competition studies), linearity/dilutability, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), and robustness.",

Similarly, guidance is needed on the best characteristics for controls and implementation of quality control and assay acceptance criteria.

First, consensus on methodologies, assay validation, and analysis of results is required to facilitate comparisons among data generated in different laboratories. The requirements for a diagnostic assay will likely differ in some aspects from assays used to perform postvaccination immunity evaluation. Stability of assay results over time will be dependent on the consistent availability of appropriately characterized reagents and materials. Studies are required to determine the effect on assay results of different sources and lots of antigen, conjugate and other reagents. A proficiency panel of human sera is vital to harmonization of methods between laboratories, although creating a panel with sufficient volume for worldwide use will be a challenge. A reference laboratory or a series of connected reference laboratories will be essential as resources for methodology, change control and management and evaluation of the proficiency panel. Finally, a repository for the distribution of standardized materials, such as antigens, conjugates, and reference materials, will be crucial for standardization and harmonization of B. pertussis assays.",
