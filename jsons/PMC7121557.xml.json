            "text": "Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is also known as nucleophosmin (NPM), nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, and numatrin in mammals, and NO38 in amphibians. NPM1 was first discovered as a nucleolar protein in rat liver cells and Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Table 10.1) (Orrick et al. 1973). It was first named as B23 because it was the 23rd protein in region B of the gel slab when the protein spots were numbered in order of decreasing mobility in both electrophoretic dimensions. It serves as a nuclear chaperone and has many other important functions (Grisendi et al. 2006). Nucleophosmin 2 (NPM2), originally called nucleoplasmin, was first identified and purified from the eggs of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis (Laskey et al. 1978), in which it is the most abundant nuclear protein (Mills et al. 1980). It binds histones and transfers them to DNA, and facilitates the assembly of nucleosomes \u2013 the basic building block of chromatin. Nucleophosmin 3 (NPM3) was cloned and characterized as a novel gene (npm3) in mouse, and found to be very similar to human NPM1 and Xenopus npm2 in amino acid sequence, protein features, and exon organization (MacArthur and Shackleford 1997). In the same year, NPM3 was also discovered by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a very acidic protein (NO29) immunolocalized in the nucleoli of Xenopus oocytes, and forming complex with NPM1 (Zirwes et al. 1997). It was proposed to be involved in the assembly of preribosomal particles.\n",

Nuclear chaperones serve to ensure proper assembly of nucleosomes and proper formation of higher order structures of chromatin. In fact, this family of proteins has such diverse functions in cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, genome stability, centrosome replication, and transcriptional regulation. Of the members of this family, NPM1 is the most studied because it is often altered in expression levels in tumors and mutated/translocated in hematological malignancies (Grisendi et al. 2006). It is the main focus of this review. NPM2 and NPM3 are less well characterized, and are also discussed wherever appropriate. Invertebrate NPM-like proteins are not discussed in this review.",

Transcript variant 2 skips an in-frame exon (exon 8) and produces a shorter protein (isoform 2) of 265 amino acids, whose functions and expression pattern are not known. Transcript variant 3 utilizes an alternate 3\u2032 exon (exon 10) and hence produces a 259-amino-acid protein with a C-terminus different from that of isoform 1. The corresponding isoforms 1 and 3 in rat are B23.1 and B23.2, and have different subcellular distribution patterns (Wang et al. 1993). Isoform 1 is localized in the nucleolus (Michalik et al. 1981; Spector et al. 1984) while isoform 3 is found in the nucleoplasm with low expression levels (Dalenc et al. 2002).",

This core domain is responsible for oligomerization and the molecular chaperone activity of NPM1 by suppressing the misfolding and aggregation of target proteins in the crowded environment in the nucleolus (Szebeni and Olson 1999). This region can also interact with core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to function as a histone chaperone and facilitate nucleosome assembly (Okuwaki et al. 2001b). A functional role of this domain in ribosomal biogenesis and p53-related tumor suppression has also been implicated (Colombo et al. 2002; Murano et al. 2008).",

The core region forms a tight pentameric assembly through hydrophobic interactions between the monomeric subunits (Fig. 10.2b). Moreover, in the crystallization environment, two pentameric complexes align along their fivefold symmetry axis and associate in head-to-head fashion to form a decameric assembly (Fig. 10.2c). The monomeric and pentameric structures of human NPM1 core domain are highly similar to that of the core region of several other NPM proteins including the Xenopus NO38 (i.e., npm1) (Namboodiri et al. 2004), the Xenopus nucleoplasmin (i.e., npm2) (Dutta et al. 2001), and the Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein (i.e., dNPL) (Namboodiri et al. 2003). All these structures share the same \u03b2-sandwich fold with root mean square deviation of \u223c1.0  \u00c5 for the C\u03b1 atoms (Lee et al. 2007). Such an oligomeric assembly observed in crystal structures agrees with previous findings that NPM proteins have a propensity to oligomerize with the benefit of enhanced thermostability (Umekawa et al. 1993; Herrera et al. 1996). A structure-based model of the NPM-histone complex, mainly based on the structures of the Xenopus NO38 and nucleoplasmin core domain, was proposed to consist of the NPM decamer and the histone octamer, with either the H2A-H2B dimer or the H3-H4 tetramer contacting the NPM core on the lateral surface of the decameric ring (Fig. 10.2c) (Dutta et al. 2001; Namboodiri et al. 2004). However, many details of this modeled oligomeric assembly still await further clarification.\n",

            "text": "A notable difference between the structure of human NPM1 core domain and structures of the other NPM proteins is the plasticity of the pentamer\u2013pentamer interface observed in crystal lattice. When the decameric structure of human NPM1 core region is superimposed onto that of Xenopus NO38 by aligning one of the pentamers (referred to as the top one), the other pentamer (referred to as the bottom one) in the decameric assembly shows a large rotational offset (\u223c20\u00b0) from that of Xenopus npm1 core (Fig. 10.2d) and a relative smaller rotational offset (\u223c10\u00b0) from that of Xenopus npm2 core (Lee et al. 2007). Such rotational offset does not change the pattern of which monomer of the top pentamer contacts the corresponding monomer of the bottom pentamer, but it does lead to different sets of polar interactions between these monomers to stabilize the pentamer\u2013pentamer interface (Lee et al. 2007). In addition, the molecular composition of the lateral surface for the NPM decamer assembly would be affected by such rotational offset as well. This structural plasticity is likely due to the small interface area between the pentamers (\u223c560  \u00c52) and the limited number of residues directly involved in polar interactions at the interface (Lee et al. 2007). The differences in the decameric assembly of human and Xenopus NPM proteins could have a significant implication for their respective histone chaperone function because the histones were proposed in the above-mentioned structural model to contact the lateral surface of the decameric assembly. Indeed, some substrate preferences toward the various core histone proteins have been observed for NPM proteins, with Xenopus npm1 showing preference for the H3-H4 tetramers and the Xenopus npm2 preferring the H2A-H2B dimers (Dutta et al. 2001; Namboodiri et al. 2003).",

The NPM1\u2013ARF interaction can lead to cell growth arrest and tumor suppression in either p53-dependent manner through the p53-Mdm2 pathway or p53-independent manner by inhibiting ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Bertwistle et al. 2004; Brady et al. 2004; Itahana et al. 2003; Korgaonkar et al. 2005). Several conserved residues critical for NPM1\u2013ARF interaction (Leu102, Gly105, and Gly107) are located on a short GS loop between \u03b27 and \u03b28 strand, in close proximity to the pentamer\u2013pentamer interface of the decameric ring (Fig. 10.2a) (Enomoto et al. 2006). Mutations of these residues (Leu102Ala, Gly105Ala, and Gly107Ala) abolish the NPM1\u2013ARF interaction and lead to loss of the NPM1 oligomeric state, probably by disturbing the pentamer\u2013pentamer interactions and weakening the hydrophobic interactions between the monomer subunits within the pentameric assembly (Enomoto et al. 2006). The monomeric mutated NPM1 is delocalized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and displays increased susceptibility to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Enomoto et al. 2006).",

The first motif (residues 42\u201347) is located on the \u03b23 strand forming part of inter-subunit interface within the pentameric ring (Fig. 10.2a). Mutation of two conserved leucine residues in this sequence motif (Leu42Ala and Leu44Ala) leads to a defective NPM1 that cannot be shuttled out of nucleus (Maggi et al. 2008). Such defect inhibits the nuclear export of both the 40S and 60S ribosomal units, which associate with NPM1 and depend on the shuttling of NPM1 for their export (Maggi et al. 2008). Thus, for this shuttling-defective NPM1 mutant, the available pool of cytoplasmic ribosome units would be reduced and the overall protein synthesis diminished, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. The second NES motif (residues 94\u2013102) is located on the \u03b27 strand on the outer lateral surface of the pentameric ring. This motif leads to nuclear export of NPM1 by the Ran-Crm1 complex, and enables the association of NPM1 with the centrosome during mitosis to prevent centrosome reduplication (Wang et al. 2005). Removal of this NES motif by deleting residues 94\u2013102 or mutating two conserved leucine residues (Leu100Ala and Leu102Ala) leads to nuclear retention of NPM1 and supernumerary centrosomes (Wang et al. 2005).",

Dictated by the many acidic aspartate and glutamate residues, the distinct electrostatic property of this region suggests that it can possibly be engaged in interaction with basic proteins such as histones and sperm basic proteins to facilitate nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling. Indeed, the acidic stretch A1 was found to be critical for the histone chaperone activity of NPM1. While an NPM1 construct encompassing both the pentameric core domain and the acidic stretch A1 shows \u223c97% chaperone activity, the pentameric domain alone shows only 30% chaperone activity and may be incapable of assembling nucleosomes (Hingorani et al. 2000). In the proposed model of NPM\u2013histone complex mentioned above, the acidic stretch A1 was included as a critical element to bind to histone proteins and facilitate the assembly of the NPM\u2013histone complex (Fig. 10.2c) (Dutta et al. 2001; Namboodiri et al. 2004).",

Similarly, another study demonstrated that the human hepatitis delta virus antigen molecules (HDVAgs) interact with NPM1 to up-regulate NPM1 expression and enhance viral replication (Huang et al. 2001). In vitro and in vivo studies mapped this NPM1\u2013HDVAgs interaction to the N-terminal basic region of HDVAgs and the acidic stretch A1, probably because of their electrostatic complementarity (Huang et al. 2001). Lastly, the acidic region in general has been speculated to contribute to the relatively high affinity of NPM1 for peptides containing sequences of NLSs of the SV40 T-antigen type, such as the HIV Rev protein to stimulate its nuclear import and viral replication (Szebeni et al. 1997).",

Such binding could be positive for NPM1\u2019s function in nucleosome assembly by coordinating the packaging of DNA molecules onto core histone proteins. Moreover, this binding activity would be beneficial to the functional role of NPM1 in ribosomal biogenesis because NPM1 should recognize and associate with preribosomal particles to transport them from nucleus to cytoplasm. In fact, NPM1 has been found to interact with rRNA and several ribonuclear proteins in the 40S and 60S ribosome units (Yu et al. 2006; Maggi et al. 2008). This basic region also mediates the interaction of NPM1 with tumor suppressor p53.

Several well-conserved aromatic residues, including Trp288 and Trp290, are found to form a hydrophobic core and are critical to the structural folding of this domain. Mutation of these tryptophan residues to alanine results in collapse of the structure and loss of nucleolar localization (Grummitt et al. 2008). This result indicates that the structural integrity of this domain is critical to its nucleolar localization. Several surface lysine residues (Lys248, Lys263, and Lys267) have also been found to be critical to nucleolar localization of NPM1 although they are not critical to the structural integrity of this domain. Thus, these lysine residues could serve a functional, instead of a structural, role for nucleolar localization of NPM1.\n",

These features include the abundant NPM1 localization in nucleolus and the ability to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm to bind nucleic acids and to transport preribosomal particles (Borer et al. 1989; Yun et al. 2003; Wang et al. 1994; Dumbar et al. 1989; Prestayko et al. 1974; Olson et al. 1986). In fact, NPM1 has been found to have intrinsic ribonuclease activity and be able to process preribosomal RNA in the internal transcribed spacer sequence (Savkur and Olson 1998; Herrera et al. 1995). This ribonuclease-mediated processing of ribosomal RNA is facilitated necessarily by the chaperone property of NPM1, which is important in preventing the aggregation of proteins in nucleolus during the process of ribosomal assembly. This proposition is supported by the finding that knockdown of NPM1 changes the ribosome profile and suppression of NPM1 inhibits the processing of preribosomal RNA (Grisendi et al. 2005; Itahana et al. 2003). One of the common morphological features of tumor cells is the enlarged nucleoli. This observation is conceivably linked to the proposed oncogenic role of NPM1 because the frequently observed aberrantly high NPM1 expression in rapidly proliferating tumor cells is generally consistent with the rapid ribosome biogenesis in maintaining the proliferative potential of tumor cells (Ruggero and Pandolfi 2003).",

Nevertheless, this remains to be fully understood as it has been reported that NPM1-deficient embryos can survive to mid-gestation (Colombo et al. 2005; Grisendi et al. 2005), but embryonic lethality at very early stages has been demonstrated in embryos deficient in pescadillo, another nonribosomal protein participating in ribosome biogenesis (Lerch-Gaggl et al. 2002). These findings illustrate the difference of the survival time between NPM1-deficient and pescadillo-deficient embryos and raise the question whether NPM1 might not be an essential protein in the process of ribosomal biogenesis. Nonetheless, it is still possible that other factors such as ribosomal storage might have compensated for the loss of NPM1 in the NPM1-deficient embryos until the stage of mid-gestation (Grisendi et al. 2006).",

NPM1 is able to form a stable complex with YY1 and, interestingly, the transcriptional repressive function of YY1 can be relieved by the interaction with NPM1 (Inouye and Seto 1994).

In retinoic acid-induced differentiation in human leukemia HL-60 cells, a decline in c-myc, NPM1, and its promoter activity is observed (Yung 2004). The transcriptional mechanism underlying the down-regulation of NPM1 during retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation involves dynamic changes in the promoter occupancy of different transcriptional regulators and these include NPM1 and AP2\u03b1 (Liu et al. 2007a). It is intriguing that NPM1 is demonstrated to be recruited by AP2\u03b1 to the promoters of some retinoic acid-responsive genes such as b-Myb, HSP60, and p120. These findings illustrate that NPM1 might be able to serve as a negative coregulator during retinoic acid signaling-induced gene expression. All these data indicate the potential important function of NPM1 as a molecular regulator of gene expression at the transcriptional level. By examining the U1 bladder cancer U4 premalignant cells, the intimate relationship of NPM1 with Ras and c-Myc has been further \u00addemonstrated in proliferation of cells associated with a high degree of malignancy (Yeh et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Overexpression of NPM1 can promote cell survival and this is accomplished partly through the inhibition of apoptosis (Ye 2005). Several pieces of evidenc support the anti-apoptotic role of NPM1. First of all, the oncogenic role of NPM1 hinges on its ability in inhibiting apoptosis in response to hypoxia (Li et al. 2004). As NPM1 is a transcriptional target of hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1), it has been reported that aberrantly increased expression of NPM1 might result in inhibition of the \u00adactivation of tumor suppressor p53 and thus dampen p53-mediated activation of apoptosis during hypoxia-driven tumor progression (Li et al. 2004). Second, over-expression of NPM1 has been shown to induce resistance to ultraviolet irradiation-induced apoptosis, which is mediated by the tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1, a transcription factor involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest) in NIH-3 T3 fibroblast cells (Wu et al. 2002b; Kondo et al. 1997). Third, as demonstrated in hematopoietic cells, overexpression of NPM1 has been shown to be related to the suppression of the activation of interferon-inducible, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which normally induces apoptosis (Pang et al. 2003; Jagus et al. 1999). This observation has been associated with the aberrant proliferation of tumor cells. Fourth, NPM1 is shown to have a functional role as the receptor for second messenger phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) in nucleus and this NPM1\u2013PIP3 complex is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. The formation of nuclear NPM1\u2013PIP3 complex has been shown to suppress apoptosis by inhibiting the DNA fragmentation activity of the pro-apoptotic factor caspase-activated DNase in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor (Ahn et al. 2005). Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic function of NPM1 has been related to its inhibitory effect on tumor suppressor p53. NPM1 interacts with p53 in hypoxic cells to hinder the hypoxia-induced activation of p53 phosphorylation (Li et al. 2004). There is evidence that NPM1 might inhibit the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and thus abrogate the induction of p21 (Li et al. 2005). Last but not least, NPM1 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein GADD45\u03b1, which is responsive to genotoxic stress. While GADD45\u03b1 lacks a classical NLS, NPM1 has been shown to serve as the molecular chaperone for GADD45\u03b1 in controlling its subcellular distribution. Most importantly, disruption of NPM1\u2013GADD45\u03b1 \u00adcomplex has been found to impair the cell cycle arrest and apoptotic functions of GADD45\u03b1 (Gao et al. 2005).",

            "text": "NPM1 is also involved in the regulation of activity and stability of some key tumor suppressors such as ARF and p53. NPM1 is associated with the stabilization of ARF by retarding the turnover of ARF and this stabilization is essential to maintain the biological function of ARF (Kuo et al. 2004, 2008). The protective effect of NPM1 on ARF turnover involves both proteasome-dependent and -independent degradation. While ARF is known to suppress cell proliferation through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways (Bertwistle et al. 2004; Brady et al. 2004; Itahana et al. 2003; Korgaonkar et al. 2005), the deficiency of NPM1 has been demonstrated to result in acceleration of tumorigenesis and this is probably attributed to the destabilization of ARF (Sherr 2006). Taken together, NPM1 can possibly work with ARF in mediating the response to oncogenic stimulus. ARF is able to suppress cell proliferation by inhibiting the biogenesis of ribosome through the retardation of the production of rRNA (Sugimoto et al. 2003). Thus, the interaction of NPM1 and ARF in nucleolus is another way of controlling the cell proliferative activities.",

A putative link has been established between the integrity of nucleolus and p53 stability, in which the nucleolus is believed to play a role in sensing the abundance of p53 in proliferating cells (Rubbi and Milner 2003). Indeed, NPM1 has been shown to promote p53 stability when undergoing nucleoplasmic relocalization (Horn and Vousden 2004). It has been demonstrated that NPM1 in the nucleolus can increase the stability of p53 by suppressing the physical binding interaction between MDM2 and p53 in response to ultraviolet irradiation (Kurki et al. 2004a, b). In response to cellular stress stimulus, disruption of nucleolar integrity induces the translocation of nucleolar NPM1 between subcellular compartments and the relocalized NPM1 can participate in the corresponding reaction mediated by p53 (Rubbi and Milner 2003; Horn and Vousden 2004).",

NPM1 is found to translocate to the chromosome periphery and the cytoplasmic entities called nucleolus-derived foci (NDF) (Dundr et al. 2000). It then redistributes to the poles of the mitotic spindle to interact with a nuclear matrix protein called NuMA to control the formation of centrosomes in prometaphase and mitotic poles in metaphase (Compton and Cleveland 1994; Zatsepina et al. 1999). The consistent observation that NPM1 is present at the mitotic spindle poles suggests the protective role of NPM1 in preventing hyper-amplification of centrosome to ensure successful progression through G2-M phases (Tokuyama et al. 2001; Zatsepina et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2004). Indeed, NPM1 is not classified as a centrosomal protein but it has been proposed to be involved in the duplication of centrosomes. This is supported by the data that NPM1 is associated specifically with the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation, which facilitates centrosome duplication (Okuda 2002; Tokuyama et al. 2001; Andersen et al. 2003).",

It has been demonstrated that overexpression of NPM3 decreased the rates of pre-rRNA synthesis and processing, but overexpression of a NPM3 mutant that did not interact with NPM1 did not change the pre-rRNA synthesis and processing (Huang et al. 2005). Moreover, the expression level of NPM3 has been shown to be correlated with the process of decondensation of paternal chromosome after fertilization (McLay and Clarke 2003). Intriguingly, NPM3 has also been found to be associated with the histone tail peptides and serves as a histone-binding protein in mouse embryonic stem cells (Motoi et al. 2008). Thus, NPM3 is believed to be a chromatin-remodeling protein responsible for the unique chromatin structure and replicative capacity of embryonic stem cells. Recently, NPM3 was shown to interact with all the individual core histones and was able to enhance transcription via the modulation of the histone chaperone activities of its interacting partner NPM1 in vitro (Gadad et al. 2010).",

            "text": "For phosphorylation of NPM1, several kinases have been identified. Phosphorylation of NPM1 by cyclin E/cdk2 during G1 phase has been documented and this may be related to the initiation of centrosome duplication by dissociating NPM1 from centriole (Tarapore et al. 2006; Tokuyama et al. 2001). The RNA-binding activity of NPM1 is diminished after cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of Thr199 of NPM1 during mitosis, and this is suggested to link to the disassembly of nucleolus by disrupting the RNA-protein binding interaction of NPM1 (Hisaoka et al. 2010; Okuwaki et al. 2002). Phosphorylation of Thr199 has also been implicated in inhibiting GCN5-mediated histone acetylation (Zou et al. 2008). During mitosis, NPM1 is found to be phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which might be an important event in mediating mitosis (Zhang et al. 2004). During interphase, NPM1 has also been reported to be phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) and this is thought to have a role in regulating the nucleolar structure by modulating the dynamic localization of NPM1 between nucleolus and nucleoplasm (Szebeni et al. 2003; Negi and Olson 2006). Dephosphorylation can be another mechanism in regulating the functions of NPM1. A serine/threonine protein phosphatase called PP1\u03b2 has been shown to dephosphorylate NPM1 in response to DNA damage during ultraviolet irradiation and this process is suggested to facilitate the DNA repair process (Lin et al. 2010).",

NPM1 has been shown to be the ubiquitination substrate of BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase, but intriguingly the product is not targeted for proteasome-dependent protein degradation unless destabilized by tumor suppressor ARF (Sato et al. 2004; Itahana et al. 2003). Sumoylation is shown to be another mechanism that can modulate the activities of NPM1.

            "text": "Insertion in between the bases of the Trp288 codon results in the loss of both tryptophan residues while insertion (with or without concomitant deletion) at positions after the Trp288 codon removes the Trp290 residue only. There is a strong correlation between the loss of one or two tryptophan residues and the type of new NES motif generated at the C-terminus. Loss of both tryptophan residues is always found with the common NES motif Leu-xxx-Val-xx-Val-x-Leu, where x is any amino acid. On the contrary, loss of Trp290 alone is always found with the much less frequent variant NES motif Leu-Trp xx-X-xx-Val-x-Leu, where X replaces the Val residue and can be leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, or cysteine (Rau and Brown 2009). Experimentally, the variant NES motifs were found to provide a much stronger force than the common NES motif in driving the Trp288-containing mutated NPM1 from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm (Bolli et al. 2007). Tested with the same experimental system, the physiological N-terminal NES motifs were found to be weak in transporting the wildtype NPM1 protein to the cytoplasm, and this explains the dominant localization of the wildtype NPM1 protein in the nucleolus. The artificial combination of a common weak C-terminal NES motif with a Trp288-containing NPM1 mutant localized the mutated protein mainly in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus with much less export to the cytoplasm. Intriguingly, a weak C-terminal NES motif together the retention of the Trp288 residue has never been detected in any primary AML samples. Therefore, this strongly suggests that cytoplasmic mislocalization of the mutated NPM1 protein is critical to the development of AML (Bolli et al. 2007).",

In all three cases, the mutations produce truncated mutated NPM1 proteins and hence abolish both Trp288 and Trp290 residues, and simultaneously create new functional NES motifs at the new respective C-termini (Mariano et al. 2006; Albiero et al. 2007; Falini et al. 2007a).

However, how somatic NPM1 frameshift mutations lead to NPMc+ AML remains elusive. The putative underlying mechanisms can be explored from two perspectives (Falini et al. 2007c, 2011). First, the remaining single copy of wildtype NPM1 allele produces wildtype NPM1 protein, which is less than that in normal counterparts and is also dislocated to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm as a result of forming heterodimers with mutated NPM1 protein. Second, the mutated NPM1 allele produces mutated NPM1 protein, which is dislocated to the cytoplasm by its very nature, may recruit and hence dislocate other interacting nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm, and may also interact with other new partners in the cytoplasm.",

In addition, chromosomal abnormalities were also consistently found in these mice. This shows that Npm1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in hemopoiesis.

            "text": "Removal of the critical C-terminal tryptophan residues and generation of a new C-terminal NES motif dictate the localization of the mutated NPM1 protein in the cytoplasm, instead of in the nucleolus (Falini et al. 2006) (see Sect. 10.5.1.1). Intriguingly, mutated NPM1 protein may still be able to interact with other nuclear proteins that interact with the wildtype NPM1 protein in normal cells, and dislocate them to the cytoplasm. Indeed, at least four such nucleolar/nuclear interacting partners have been found to interact with the mutated NPM1 protein, be dislocated to the cytoplasm, and hence have their physiological functions abrogated: mouse p19Arf and human p14ARF (den Besten et al. 2005; Colombo et al. 2006; Bolli et al. 2009), hexamethylene bis-acetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) (Gurumurthy et al. 2008), the F-box protein Fbw7\u03b3 (Bonetti et al. 2008), and Miz1 (Wanzel et al. 2008). Attenuation of the functions of these interacting proteins are suggested to contribute to the oncogenic effect of NPMc+, as briefly explained below one by one. First, ARF is a well-known tumor suppressor and is stabilized by wildtype NPM1 protein in the nucleolus (Gallagher et al. 2006; Sherr 2006). In vitro experiments have shown that mutated NPM1 protein can interact directly with ARF and shuttle it to the cytoplasm, but cannot protect it from degradation (den Besten et al. 2005; Colombo et al. 2006). Second, HEXIM1 is an inhibitor of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is itself an important transcriptional regulator of the enzyme RNA polymerase II (Dey et al. 2007). Wildtype NPM1 negatively regulates HEXIM1 via proteasome-mediated degradation while mutated NPM1 associates with and shuttles HEXIM1 to the cytoplasm and hence promotes P-TEFb-mediated transcription in the nucleus (Gurumurthy et al. 2008). Third, the F-box protein Fbw7\u03b3 is a component of the E3 ligase complex, which ubiquitinates and degrades the oncoprotein c-Myc via the proteasome pathway (Welcker and Clurman 2008). Wildtype NPM1 protein localizes and stabilizes Fbw7\u03b3 in the nucleolus, and hence regulates the turnover of c-Myc (Bonetti et al. 2008). Mutated NPM1 protein interacts with Fbw7\u03b3 and dislocates it to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded. As a result, c-Myc is stabilized \u2013 a situation that reflects the oncogenic potential of NPMc+ (Bonetti et al. 2008). Fourth, Miz1 is a Myc-associated zinc-finger protein and, when bound to Myc, enables Myc to suppress transcription of the genes encoding the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 (Adhikary and Eilers 2005). Wildtype NPM1 localizes Miz1 to the nucleolus and is an essential coactivator of Miz1. However, mutated NPM1 protein re-directs Miz1 to the cytoplasm and exhibits dominant-negative effect on Miz1 (Wanzel et al. 2008). Thus, disruption of Miz1 function may contribute to the transforming potential of NPMc+.",

In transgenic mice expressing human NPMc+ under the influence of a myeloid-specific promoter, expansion of myeloid cells is noted in bone marrow and spleen (Cheng et al. 2010).

Because of their uniqueness, the mutation and the cytoplasmic localization of the mutated protein can be used as clonal markers to study the cell lineage involved in NPMc+ AML. Clonal NPM1 mutations are found in myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells, but not in fibroblasts and endothelial cells (Pasqualucci et al. 2006). In addition, two or more myeloid hemopoietic cell lineages are affected in about 62% of NPMc+ AML cases while the remaining 38% involve only one myeloid cell lineage (Pasqualucci et al. 2006). On the other hand, B and T lymphoid cells are not part of the mutated clones in NPMc+ AML (Martelli et al. 2008).

The surface marker CD34 is typically present on hematopoietic stem cells. This raises the question whether the NPM1 mutation arises in a CD34\u2212 multipotent hemotapoietic progenitor (Engelhardt et al. 2002) or whether there exists a small pool of CD34+/CD38\u2212 NPM1-mutated progenitor. CD34+/CD38\u2212 cells usually contain the leukemia stem cells that are capable of propagating and maintaining the leukemia phenotype in immuocompromised mice (Estrov 2010). Indeed, CD34+ cells from NPMc+ AML carry the NPM1 mutation and, when transplanted into immunocompromised mice, generate a leukemia phenotype that is the same as the original patient\u2019s disease in all aspects (Martelli et al. 2010). On the other hand, the evidence for the engraftment capability of CD34\u2212 cells from NPMc+ AML is less consistent (Martelli et al. 2010; Taussig et al. 2010). These findings may reflect the heterogeneity of leukemia stem cells in NPMc+ AML.",

It is of interest to note that miR-10a, -10b, 196a, and -196b are located within the genomic cluster of the HOX genes (Jongen-Lavrencic et al. 2008).

As a group, NPMc+ AML has many distinctive features. NPM1 mutations are unique to AML, usually de novo AML, (Falini et al. 2005, 2007c; Liso et al. 2008) and mutually exclusive of other \u201cAML with recurrent genetic abnormalities\u201d listed in the 2008 WHO Classification (Falini et al. 2005, 2008b). They are usually detected in all cells of the leukemic population and are stable over the course of the disease (Chou et al. 2006; Falini et al. 2008a). As such, monitoring of minimal residual disease can easily be achieved by detection of the NPM1 mutations with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (Wertheim and Bagg 2008). NPM1 mutations appear to precede other associated mutations like fms-like tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), which is found in 40% of NPMc+ AML (Thiede et al. 2006; Gale et al. 2008). Moreover, NPMc+ AML cells have distinct gene and microRNA expression profiles (see Sect. 10.5.1.3). Taken together, these features suggest that the NPM1 mutation is a founder genetic alteration in NPMc+ AML (Falini et al. 2011).",

About 60% of ALCL cases express the tyrosine kinase gene ALK (anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase) and are known as ALK+ ALCL. In general, ALK+ ALCL show good response to induction therapy and has good prognosis. The majority (\u223c85%) of such cases carry the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosome translocation, which joins the NPM1 gene on 5q35 with the ALK gene on 2p23 to produce the chimeric gene NPM1-ALK and hence the fusion protein. The remaining 15% are heterogeneous at the molecular level because the translocations involve other chromosomal partners. The NPM1-ALK fusion protein consists of the N-terminal part of the NPM1 protein (the first 116 amino acids; carrying the oligomerization domain) and the entire cytoplasmic domain of the ALK protein (the last 563 amino acids; carrying the catalytic domain). Through the oligomerization domain, the NPM1-ALK fusion proteins form homodimers with each other, and heterodimers with the wildtype NPM1 protein. Because of the NPM1 promoter, the fusion protein is ectopically expressed in lymphoid cells and the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domain is thought to contribute to the tumor formation. The fusion protein is expressed in the cytoplasm as expected but is also unexpectedly localized in the nucleus because of the shuttling of the heterodimers composed of the fusion protein and the wildtype NPM1, which still possesses the nucleus localization signal and hence imports the heterodimers into the nucleus.",

HIV is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and possesses two identical copies of positive-sense RNA genomes. Replication of HIV-1 is a complicated process and involves both nucleus and cytoplasm. During replication, the RNA genome is being reverse-transcribed into DNA in the cytoplasm and transported to the nucleus, where the DNA is transcribed into mRNA and the latter then returns to the cytoplasm for subsequent translation. The HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev is involved in the export of partially spliced or unspliced mRNA from the nucleus (Perkins et al. 1989). As Rev is localized in the nucleolus, it was speculated that certain host factors would be involved in the transportation of Rev in and out of the nucleolus. Using affinity chromato\u00adgraphy, Fankhauser et al. (1991) confirmed the participation of NPM1 in the transit of Rev between cytoplasm and nucleus, which allowed for further rounds of export of HIV-1 mRNA. Apart from Rev, NPM1 also localizes the HIV Tat protein into \u00adnucleolus (Li 1997), where Tat will recruit cellular cofactor (positive transcription elongation factor b or P-TEFb) and transactivate proviral DNA transcription. This process is critical for HIV replication.",

It is transmitted among mosquitoes and pigs, and transmission to humans may occur when the number of infected mosquito vectors increases to a very high level. The RNA genome encodes the envelope, structural proteins, as well as core and the non-structural proteins. Similar to HCV and other flaviviridae, JEV core protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Bulich and Aaskov 1992; Tsuda et al. 2006). According to mutation and animal inoculation studies, localization of core protein in the nucleus is crucial to the replication of JEV (Mori et al. 2005). During JEV infection, amino acids Gly42 and Pro43 of the JEV core protein interact with the N-terminal region of NPM1, and this interaction results in transportation of the viral core protein into the nucleus (Tsuda et al. 2006). Both chaperone and RNA binding activities of NPM1 are important for JEV replication. Besides, dislocation of NPM1 from nucleus to cytoplasm has also been noted. Although the precise mechanism is not well-defined, it is possible that NPM1 is retained in the cytoplasm by JEV-induced cytoplasmic factors or NPM1 is released into the cytoplasm on disruption of nuclear organization (Tsuda et al. 2006).",

Patients with chronic HBV infection and superinfected with HDV can suffer from much more severe complications such as fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus possesses an RNA genome and HDVAg in two isoforms; the small form is involved in HDV RNA replication and the large form in virus assembly (Casey 2006). Replication of HDV occurs in the nucleolus, and NPM1 interacts with HDV antigens and modulates viral RNA replication (Huang et al. 2001; Li et al. 2006). During HDV infection, NPM1 is up-regulated and interacts with the small and the large form (to a lesser extent) of HDVAg. The interaction domains of NPM1\u2013HDVAg are within the NLS of HDVAg and NPM1 acts as a shuttle protein for transportation of HDVAg into the nucleus. Apart from this, NPM1 also plays a role in HDV RNA replication. Huang et al. (2001) demonstrated that exogenous NPM1 had stimulatory effect on HDV RNA replication, while deleting the HDV binding site in NPM1 impaired this effect. Besides, they also observed colocalization of the small HDVAg with NPM1 and nucleolin in the nucleolus. As nucleolin can serve as a transcriptional factor (Yang et al. 1994), this may in turn confer a regulatory role for HDVAg on HDV RNA replication.",

            "text": "Adenovirus is a double-stranded DNA virus causing a wide range of human infections including respiratory, ocular, and gastrointestinal tract infections (Lenaerts et al. 2008). Replication of the viral genome relies on three early proteins, namely, the viral polymerase (Adpol); preterminal protein (pTP), which primes DNA synthesis (Liu et al. 2003); and DNA-binding protein (DBP), which initiates DNA replication (de Jong et al. 2003). Two NPM1 isoforms are involved in adenovirus DNA replication (Hindley et al. 2007). During viral genome replication, NPM1.1 and NPM1.3 interact differently with the viral early proteins pTP and DBP, and NPM1.3 is initially localized in the DBP/viral DNA-rich regions. Once the viral pTP expression increases, NPM1.1 is localized in the pTP-rich regions and interacts with pTP. This is followed by recruiting NPM1.3 into the pTP-rich regions and interaction with the pTP/NPM1.1/viral DNA complex. Apart from genome replication, NPM1 also plays a role in viral assembly of adenovirus. During the late stage of viral infection, the viral protein V interacts with NPM1, which acts as a chaperone by transferring the newly synthesized core protein to the viral DNA genome (Matthews and Russell 1998; Samad et al. 2007).",

The virus is capable of cell transformation and is associated with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Renne et al. 1996; Zhong et al. 1996). KSHV remains in latency stage after infection but the virus can be reactivated by various intra- and extra-cellular factors, including cytokines, hypoxia, and chemical agents (Miller et al. 2007). In addition, interactions of the viral protein with host transcription factors and components of the host cellular signaling pathways may reactivate the virus. The KSHV latent protein v-cyclin and host cellular CDK6 kinase can phosphorylate NPM1 on threonine 199 (Sarek et al. 2010). Phosphorylation of NPM1 facilitates interaction of NPM1 with the latency-associated nuclear antigen, a repressor for viral lytic replication.

The positive-sense RNA genome of HCV encodes the viral envelope, core protein, and several other nonstructural proteins (Choo et al. 1991; Takamizawa et al. 1991). Among various HCV viral proteins, the core protein is the best studied. Instead of being a viral nucleocapsid, the core protein interacts with various host cellular factors and influences various host cell functions including apoptosis, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (Fischer et al. 2007; Koike 2007). One of the host cellular factors that interact with HCV is NPM1. The virus interacts with NPM1 through the NLSs located in the core protein amino acid 51\u2013100 (Chen et al. 2003) and is transported into the nucleolus. During HCV infection, NPM1 together with YY1 and P300 forms complex with HCV (Mai et al. 2006). This relieves the suppression effect of YY1 on the NPM1 promoter, thereby up-regulating the expression of NPM1, which in turn activates RNA polymerase I transcription and results in higher rate of ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this promotes cell proliferation during viral infection, and consequently leads to cell transformation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",

The 30-kb positive-sense RNA genome encodes the viral envelope, nucleocapsid, hemagglutinin, and membrane-associated proteins (Wang et al. 2003). The nucleocapsid protein is involved in viral assembly and also regulation of signal transduction. It is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected cells, but the protein is also present at low level in the nucleus (Tamini et al. 2005). The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is able to interact with various cellular proteins, including cyclophylin A (Luo et al. 2004), human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Fan et al. 2006), and CDK-cyclin complex proteins (Surjit et al. 2006). NPM1 interacts with nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV and, during the interaction, the viral protein competitively inhibits the interaction of NPM1 with CDK2 kinase, and thereby inhibits the phosphorylation of NPM1 (Zeng et al. 2008). A decrease in phosphorylation inhibits the duplication of centromere, which leads to subsequent cell cycle arrest. In addition, interaction of the viral nucleocapsid protein with NPM1 may also cause defects in ribosome synthesis and results in suppression of gene expression, or leads to protein misfolding (Zeng et al. 2008).",

Other than the many processes in which NPM1 takes part, the major interest comes from its involvement in human cancers, particularly AML. Its significance stems from the fact that NPMc+ AML accounts for \u223c30% of all AML cases and usually has good prognosis. Its clinical importance also comes from its involvement in virus replication, particularly in the era of outbreaks of infectious diseases. A lot more remain to be discovered and learned for all three NPM proteins in the years to come.",
