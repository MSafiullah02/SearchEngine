Most investigators utilize the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition for severe LRTI in which children are defined as critically ill when they have warning signs such as, difficulty breathing with increased respiratory rate for age, chest wall retractions and/or stridor [3] . WHO's definition of severe LRTI does not define the need for intensive care, but the need for hospitalization. Severe LRTI cases requiring intensive care treatment do not demonstrate homogeneous features due to variations in intensive care hospitalization criteria and severe LRTI definitions [4, 5] . In the current study, severe LRTI was defined as the presence of warning signs, need for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission, and also having a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) at the time of PICU admittance.",

Simple descriptive statistics were used to calculate the mean, median and standard deviation for quantitative data, while proportions and count were used for qualitative data.

Another discrete feature of our study is the inclusion of only patients who met the previously-determined 'severe LRTI' definition. The mortality rate in our study was found to be 12.7%, which is somewhat higher than previous publications. This may very well be associated with the fact that the study was conducted on a population with severe LRTI which was defined as the need for MV in LRTI.

This hypothesis is also supported by the result that the second most common virus in children with severe LRTI was hBoV and hRV in this study. The frequency of hBoV was 27% in our study which is the highest among prior studies. Calvo et al. reported an incidence rate of 11.4% for hBoV which was much lower than our result [23] . It is becoming increasingly apparent that hBoV and hRV are important respiratory viruses which cause significant disease burden in infants and children with critical LRTI. It is worth to mention that absence of detection of hBoV in asymptomatic children adds some supporting evidence to its pathogenicity [26] . Although the pathogenic role of hBoV is under discussion, there are other studies that show the presence of hBoV in symptomatic children [18, 27] . Considering that we found higher prevalence of hBoV and hRVrather close to RSV percentage, we believe both viruses may be important in patients with severe J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f LRTI requiring PICU admission. Additionally, we found that children with positive tracheal aspirate for hBoV were significantly more likely to require IMV support at admission, compared to other viruses.",

They found that bronchiolitis and hypoxia were more common in RSV infected children but our result did not show such a difference. Hypoxia, which was considered as an indicator of disease severity in other studies, was already present in patients included in our study as all of them had acute respiratory failure.

In our study, hRV was often associated with high rates of multiple viral infection and the most common combination was: hRV+non-RSV. A study from Kuwait defined the most common multiple viral infections in LRTI were hRV, AdV and hCoV, with similar results from other studies [33] [34] [35] [36] . The most frequent combinations detected were hRV+adenovirus, hRV+hCoV and hRV+Flu A. There was no multiple viral infection with RSV and hMPV, similar to our result. Previous studies have conflicting results about clinical characteristics of single versus multiple viral infections; some showed no significant difference between multiple and single viral infection but others showed both hMPV and RSV increase the risk of admission to PICU and use of MV by 10 folds [32] . We found that multiple viral infection decreased survival rate and therefore had poor prognosis explaining the theory that multiple viral infections result from the alteration of immune response or host vulnerability [36, 37] .",

High mortality in our study was presumably associated with the fact that all patients included in the study were critically ill with severe form of LRTI and were in need of mechanical ventilator support. As most of our patients needed IMV during their admission, we believe that beyond the need of IMV, other clinical parameters may have negative impact on the survival of patients who already had severe LRTI; it is therefore feasible to suggest that all of these factors may cumulatively increase the mortality rate. Additive effect on mortality may be related to or can be explained by findings such as: increased duration of IMV, shorter time between PICU admission to IMV initiation, high PRISM III score at admission, increased PDR (%), more frequent need for inotropic support, presence of radiological findings on chest X rays (pneumomediastinum) and presence of multiple viral infections. We believe that these characteristics, even though they cannot be a direct cause of high mortality, can be related to the finding of high mortality rate in the population studied; however, these results have to be supported by other prospective studies and also in large cohorts.",

Since the number of patients with complications in each subgroup is very low, there is a need for larger patient populations in order to be able to evaluate the differences in terms of complication rates and etiology. Considering the low number of cases, it is difficult to draw conclusions concerning the mortality rate of specific viruses. Viral respiratory pathogens are known to demonstrate seasonal variations in terms of virulence, so prospective and long term studies are necessary to limit single-season confounding affects. We could not include detailed clinical parameters such as mode and parameters of MV and ventilator-associated pneumonia development. However, these might also have been associated with mortality and complications. Finally, due to the prospective study design, clinical characteristics and mortality analyses of children who did not need MV could not be assessed during the course of this study.",
