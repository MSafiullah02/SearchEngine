VZV is highly species-specific with its natural host range restricted to humans. Primary VZV infection in childhood causes a diffuse vesicular rash of varicella, followed by resolution of illness by the host immune system and establishment of latent VZV infection in the dorsal root ganglia. Reactivation of latent VZV infection results in herpes zoster, which provokes severe pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (Arvin, 1996; Arvin and Gilden, 2013) .",

            "text": "Inhibitors of VZV DNA polymerase are currently employed in the clinic to treat VZV-associated diseases (Cohen et al., 1999) . Acyclovir and famciclovir/penciclovir are nucleoside analogs which lacks the 3 -OH for the phosphodiester bond between nucleotides. Upon activation by viral thymidine kinase (TK), these drugs are incorporated into the viral DNA synthesis to prevent DNA elongation (Cohen et al., 1999) . Foscarnet, a pyrophosphate analog, binds the pyro-phosphate binding site to inhibit viral DNA polymerase (Cohen et al., 1999; Gnann Jr, 2007) . Although these anti-VZV dugs are highly effective, more concerted efforts to develop novel therapeutic strategies for VZV-associated diseases are necessary due to the emergence of drug resistance and side-effects of available antiviral agents (Ida et al., 1999; Arvin, 2002) . Members of the genus Cephalotaxus produce various alkaloids, such as cephalotaxine (CET), harringtonine (HT), homoharringtonine (HHT), isoharringtonine, and deoxyharringtonine (Lu and Wang, 2014) . CET, a benzazepinebearing pentacyclic alkaloid, is a parent structure of C3-ester compounds, including HT and HHT (Fig. 1 ). HT is a C3 \u03b1hydroxyl succinate ester of CET while HHT contains a methylene group in the side-chain (Quintas-Cardama et al., HHT, or (C) CET at concentrations of 5, 10, and 50 ng/ml. Cells treated with ACV (5 \u03bcM) served as a positive control. Luciferase activities were measured at 72 h after inoculation. VZV pOka-luciferase activity in DMSO-treated cells was set as 100%. Data are represented as means \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. The asterisk (*) denotes a significant difference between samples determined using the two-sample t-test (P < 0.05). 2009). Although CET is biologically inactive, HT and HHT exert potent antileukemic effects (Powell et al., 1972) . Indeed, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, a semisynthetic HHT produced by direct esterification of CET, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients resistant or intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Tujebajeva et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2011) .",

ACV is widely used to treat VZV-associated diseases, with a reported mean EC50 of 13 \u00b1 3 \u03bcM for VZV-pOka (Morfin et al., 1999) . Remarkably, HT and HHT were more potent than ACV in inhibiting VZV-pOka, with mean EC50 values of 18 \u00b1 6.5 and 8.5 \u00b1 2 nM, respectively.

Following screening of a natural product compound library, Kaur et al. (2013) demonstrated that HT inhibits replication of Chikungunya virus, a positivestrand RNA virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family (Kaur et al., 2013) . HHT has additionally been shown to exert antiviral effects against coronavirus, a positive-strand RNA virus, and HBV, a double-strand DNA virus (Romero et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2015) . Another recent study demonstrated that HT inhibits replication of Sindbis virus, a member of the Togaviridae family (Jia et al., 2018) . Given that HT and HHT inhibit replication of both RNA and DNA viruses, antiviral activities are most likely to be attributable to effects on cellular rather than viral factor(s), which are critical for viral replication. Cephalotaxine esters have been shown to interfere with the elongation step of translation by blocking aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the acceptor site on the large ribosome subunit and peptide bond formation (Fresno et al., 1977) . Kaur and co-workers suggested that HT suppresses Chikungunya virus replication by inhibiting the large ribosome subunit, in turn, down-regulating viral protein translation (Kaur et al., 2013) .",
