These apparently healthy people may be the most suitable for building of immunity so that infection-related pathogenesis can be countered to keep them healthy[24]. Preventive interventions here can include both pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological strategies. Among the non-pharmacological interventions healthy lifestyles, adequate physical activity, sufficient sleep, care of retainable and non-retainable urges, sadvritta, and avoidance and isolation from infected persons are vital [25]. Fumigation of homes, shelters and living-place by Ayurvedic herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) peel, turmeric (Curcuma longa) powder, Carom or Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) seeds and Loban (resin of Styrax benzoin and Boswellia species) may also be a useful strategy for disinfection [26]. In addition, community based Swarna Prashana [27] and mass prophylaxis through rasayana having the predominant effects upon respiratory tract can be useful [28]. Rasayana may include Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha or Amrit Bhallataka [29, 30]. The rationale for choice of rasayana drugs can be traced back to Samhita classics of Ayurveda as well as in contemporary research[14]. Rasayana act as antioxidant, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, vaccine adjuvant, and confer immunity against diseases [31, 32]. Further, according to Ayurveda classics, rasayana therapy [33], along with physical and social distancing from infected persons [34], constitute a core strategy to overcome epidemic and infectious diseases. Building immunity requires time. There may be some asymptomatic carriers who could transmit the virus to other apparently healthy people. Hence, physical and social distancing for all would be essential to avoid any transmission[34].",

This choice of medicines is aimed at maintenance of agni as well as aam pachana in order to prevent the progression of pathogenesis in its initial sanchaya-prakopa-prasara stage [36]. Sanjivani vati is widely used against communicable diseases, fever due to infection and sannipataj jvara, cold, cough, and indigestion. It also strengthens and rejuvenates the immune system [37, 38]. This group may also be provided with decoction of a combination of Ayurvedic herbs including Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Ocimum sanctum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Adhatoda vasica, Andrographis paniculata, Swertia chirata, Moringa oleifera, Triphala and Trikatu. These herbs are proposed for the reason that these are known to be broad-spectrum antivirals and protease inhibitors [39, 40, 41].",

The key criterion for choosing rasa aushadhi in category 3 and 4 as noted above is the urgency of initiation of therapeutic actions. Rasaaushadi are shown to have better bioavailability and absorption through sublingual and oral route accounting to the nano size of their particles[47]. For example, suvarna bhasma has been found to get absorbed well through sublingual administration when mixed with black pepper powder and ghee[48].",

This will provide an important opportunity for learning and generating credible evidence[52]. It is pertinent to reiterate that participation of Ayurveda in addressing the COVID-19 challenge in India should not remain limited and seen as the extension of healthcare services and support to bio-medical system. Indeed, with adequate monitoring and data keeping during the implementation, important lessons and research directions are likely to emerge on the management of increasingly frequent and virulent communicable diseases. Implementation of proposed action is likely to provide evidence-based insights strengthening the scope of Ayurveda beyond preventive health care and care for non-communicable diseases. AYUSH system across the country has been put on alert for being called anytime to serve the nation. AYUSH healthcare facilities are also being readied to be converted into quarantine facilities in times of need. From this perspective, implementing the suggested intervention plan within AYUSH healthcare facilities by Ayurveda workforce may benefit the nation greatly. India is the country where the world\u2019s oldest living health care system originated and therefore it is being carefully watched by the world community for how it handles the crisis using its own resources. China has done it. And it is India's turn now to show its traditional healthcare might.",
