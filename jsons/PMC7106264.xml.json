However, its mysterious animal origins [3] and strong infectivity necessitates further studies on how to control its replication in affected individuals. Retrospective studies have shown that elderly patients with SARS experienced high mortality and morbidity [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], suggesting that susceptibility to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could be correlated with aging. Based upon this observation, Roberts and colleagues established an aged mouse model that has a longer course of virus replication and more severe pathological changes in the respiratory tract than what is observed in young mice [10], which indicates that it is an appropriate animal model paralleling aged humans, in terms of susceptibility to SARS-CoV.",

It thus provides a candidate strategy for protection of host from SARS-CoV infection. Yo and colleagues found that infusion of convalescent plasma resulted in beneficial clinical outcomes in SARS patients [12]. Subbarao et al verified that passive transfer of SARS-CoV specific antisera reduces pulmonary viral titres in mice infected with SARS-CoV [13], indicating that hyperimmune sera against SARS-CoV could protect against this viral infection. On the other hand, equine antiserum has been successfully used to control various virus infections, such as rabies [14], HBV [15], [16], and HIV [17], [18]. Based on these evidence of the feasibility that equine antibody can be used for human diseases, we have developed an equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')2 that can provide excellent protection from this virus infection, that we previously have tested in a BALB/c model [19].",

On day 1 p.i., the pathological changes were mild and the lung tissue construction roughly remained normal, except for some small vessel dilatation and congestion, and edema in alveolar spaces (Fig. 2C, arrows), compared with normal mouse lung (Fig. 2A). Viral invasion of bronchial epithelial cells and, to a less extent, alveolar epithelial cells adjacent to the bronchi were observed (Fig. 2D). On day 3 p.i., there was a large degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, mainly involving mononuclear cells and lymphocytes, around the bronchi (Fig. 2E, arrows). We observed focal hemorrhages around small vessels (Fig. 2E, arrowhead), interstitial pneumonia, and shedding of bronchial epithelial cells into the bronchial lumen (Fig. 2E arrow and F). In addition to bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells were infected extensively (Fig. 2F). On day 5 p.i., there was considerable inflammatory cell infiltration that surrounded the bronchi. Shedding of epithelial cells and diffusion of blood cells into bronchial lumen were observed (Fig. 2G arrow and arrowhead). There was obvious effusion in the bronchial lumen, as well. The interstitial pneumonia had become more severe than that observed on day 3 p.i. (Fig. 2G). A large viral load was also observed in animal lungs on this day (Fig. 2H). On day 7, there appeared to be apparent focal consolidation (Fig. 2I arrowhead) and focal necrosis in the lung, accompanied by considerable inflammatory cell infiltration around the bronchi and small vessels (Fig. 2I arrow). However, by this day, the amount of virus had diminished markedly, such that only small amounts of virus could be observed around the bronchi (Fig. 2J). On day 9, consolidations were more obvious than those observed on day 7 (Fig. 2K arrows), accompanied by focal necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and moderate interstitial pneumonia, with still some evidence of effusion in the bronchial lumen (Fig. 2K).

Then, we investigated the protective roles of antibody against virus infection on day 2 p.i. and whether the protective role was antibody dose-dependant. CPE assays showed that 4 mg/kg body weight of the antibody could completely neutralize the virus in inoculated animal lungs (Fig. 3A). Even at half the effective dosage (2 mg/kg), the antibody provided remarkable protective effect (Fig. 3A). In contrast, injection of non-immunized normal equine F(ab')2 at 4 mg/kg did not protect the aged mice against SARS-CoV infection, similar to the virus positive control (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, the qRT-PCR assay also demonstrated that 4 mg/kg body weight of the antibody could completely clear the inoculated virus from the experimental lungs, as we could not detect the SARS-CoV N gene in the lung homogenates at this dose (Fig. 3B). Similar to our observation above, treatment with 2 g/kg body weight of antibody resulted in about 100-fold decrease of virus load in inoculated animal lungs (Fig. 3B). In the control group, we could still detect about 1010 copies of N genes, which did not differ from those observed in the virus positive control group (Fig. 3B).",

Each aged mouse was inoculated with 1 \u00d7 104 TCID50 SARS-CoV on day 0, and received an i.p. injection of the indicated dose of F(ab')2 on day 1. Because the half-life of the prepared F(ab')2 fragments is 60 h (as determined in rats, data submitted), we measured the therapeutic role of the antibody on days 3 and 4 p.i. When the equine neutralizing antibody was administered after virus inoculation, 40 mg/kg of antibody could relieve the pathological lesions and viral load in animal lungs (Panel 2M and 2N) on day p.i. 4, compared to virus control (Panel 2E\u2013H). On the same day, animal lungs showed mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia and lung consolidation, but the morphological structure of the lung was roughly normal (Panel 2M and 2N). The CPE assays indicated that 40 mg/kg of F(ab')2 could exert a significant therapeutic effect on the inhibition of SARS-CoV infection, because animals protected with this dose of SARS-CoV specific antibody experienced a markedly decreased viral load in their lungs, compared with the negative antibody controls (p\n < 0.01)(Fig. 4A). As expected, the therapeutic efficiency of this kind of antibody on day 4 was similar to that on day 3 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the negative antibody control, non-immune equine F(ab')2, did not provide any neutralizing effect on the virus (Fig. 4A). Our qRT-PCR assays further confirmed those results in CPE assays (Fig. 4B). The dose of 40 mg/kg F(ab')2 fragments could partially, but significantly decrease viral copies in infected animal lungs, about 1000 folds when compared to the untreated animals (Fig. 4B).",

As this aged mouse model has not been studies extensively, we employed additional methods to assess and verify the aged mouse model. We were able to infect aged BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV (BJ-01 strain) through i.n. inoculation, and could demonstrate the virus replicated effectively in the lungs of infected animals. Using the CPE assay, we observed rapid virus propagation after day 1 p.i., which peaked on day 3 p.i. (1 \u00d7 108\u2013109 TCID50/g), and thereafter diminished gradually. However, it still sustained high titres (about 106 TCID50) on day 5 p.i., similar to that reported by Roberts [10]. Quantitative PCR results showed that expression pattern of the viral N gene paralleled the viral titre changes, confirming our results from the CPE assay. Though we failed to detect any virus present on day 7 p.i. using the CPE assay, qRT-PCR showed thousand copies of virus in the lungs of some animals (2/4) (Fig. 1B). This could reflect the sensitivity difference between the CPE and real-time RT-PCR assays. CPE assay is not an absolute quantitative method, thus it cannot provide concrete virus number in certain sample. On the other hand, Taqman fluorescent qPCR assay can detect even single copy gene [20], thus it can provide more details for the molecular mechanism of SARS-related pathogenesis and the evaluation of various intervening strategies than CPE method can. Therefore, in this study we demonstrated the usefulness of qRT-PCR over the CPE assay to accurately determine virus replication, which allowed us to establish a model for SARS-CoV infection.",

Thus, even though we did not detect evidence of disease development in infected mice, detailed tissue studies reported here support the validity of the aged mice model.

This indicates that neutralizing antibodies in patients play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV clearance in vivo. Accordingly, we have generated equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')2 and shown significant protection against SARS-CoV infection in a young BALB/c mouse model [19]. Complete neutralization of the virus in infected aged mouse was achieved with 4 mg/g body weight of this antibody in a preventive setting (Fig. 3). In addition, the protected animals did not show pathological changes in their lungs (data not shown). Similar results were also observed in young mice that received comparable amount of the equine antibody [19]. Even though we did not examine the therapeutic role of this antibody in young mice due to the short infection endurance (about 3 days) [19], we have achieved great success using this antibody to treat SARS-CoV infection in aged mice, which have longer infection endurance (about 5 days) (Fig. 4). This level of protection observed (1000-fold decrease in viral load), although not complete, is remarkable, considering that the circulating antibodies can only neutralize the extracellular SARS-CoV. Our results also suggest that in therapeutic settings it might be necessary to combine passive antibody transfer with other methods such as antiviral drugs and vaccines.",

However, the issue of low MAb yield needs to be overcome when used in clinics. Polyclonal immunoglobulins can surmount the obstacle in antibody production. Another potential advantage using polyclonal antibody is the broad antigenic coverage and reduced likelihood of emergence of escape mutants. Among the various heterologous antibody approved, equine antibody is one of the appealing choices [11]. In view of the convenience of horse feeding and serum availability at the same time, the equine antibody treatment approach offers the advantage over monoclonal antibody. In spite of the availability of human or humanized MAbs in anti-SARS-CoV research [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], equine antibody is still an attractive candidate for the prevention and treatment of SARS patients.",

All animal subjects survived the injection, and the motivated host secondary lymphoid organs, the spleen and lymph node, recovered after 3 weeks post injection withdraw. Since the host anti-F(ab')2 antibody appears at 2 weeks post the F(ab')2 administration (submitted data) and the almost complete neutralization of extracellular virus, application of this antibody will inhibit other normal tissue from infection, as shown in this study, thus preventing further transmission. This will allow the host's immune system to clear the remaining virus or provide the chance for the intervention of other strategies such as antiviral drugs, RNAi and vaccines to ultimately eliminate the virus form the host.",

Panel A: CPE assays of virus titres in aged mice lungs. Virus titres are expressed as log10TCID50 per gram of lung tissue. The lower limit of detection of virus in a 10% w/v suspension of lung homogenate is 1.5 log10TCID50 per gram (as shown by dotted line). Panel B: qRT-PCR assays of virus copies in experimental animal lungs. Copies of N gene derived from SARS-CoV were expressed as absolute copies of N gene per gram of lung tissue. The antibody-negative control mice received the indicated amount of non-immune equine antibody. \u204ep < 0.01 (1-way ANOVA assay) compared with 40 mg/kg of non-immune equine antibody control.",
