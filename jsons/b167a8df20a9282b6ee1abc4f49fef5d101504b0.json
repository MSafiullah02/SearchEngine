Several respiratory pathogens are circulating simultaneously and typical symptoms of different respiratory infections are alike, meaning it is challenging to identify and diagnose different respiratory pathogens based on symptoms alone. mariPOC\u00ae is an automated, multianalyte antigen test which allows the rapid detection of nine respiratory infection pathogens [influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1-3 viruses and pneumococci] from a single nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate samples, and, in addition, can be linked to laboratory information systems. During the study period from November 2010 to June 2014, a total of 22, 485 multianalyte respi tests were performed in the 14 participating laboratories in Finland and, in total, 6897 positive analyte results were recorded. Of the tested samples, 25 % were positive for one respiratory pathogen, with RSV (9.8 %) and influenza A virus (7.2 %) being the most common findings, and 0.65 % of the samples were multivirus-positive. Only small geographical variations in seasonal epidemics occurred. Our results show that the mariPOC\u00ae multianalyte respi test allows simultaneous detection of several respiratory pathogens in real time. The results are reliable and give the clinician a picture of the current epidemiological situation, thus minimising guesswork.",

            "text": "Every year, respiratory viruses cause seasonal epidemics. In Northern Europe, the epidemic season starts in September-October and lasts until April. Since several respiratory pathogens are circulating at the same time and typical symptoms of different respiratory infections (cough, fever, rhinitis, headache etc.) are quite similar, it can be difficult to identify and diagnose different pathogens based on symptoms alone. To be able to avoid unnecessary antimicrobial treatment and to focus antiviral treatment properly, rapid and reliable detection of respiratory pathogens is needed. At the moment, verified viral results in Finland are reported to the Register for Infectious Diseases of the National Institute for Health and Welfare (NIHW, http://www.thl.fi/ttr/gen/rpt/tilastot.html, [1]). Data from this national register go to The European Surveillance System (TESSy), a data bank organised by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, [2] ), and these European-wide data are further combined with data collected all over the world by the World Health Organization (WHO, [3] ). After the data are collected, they need to be analysed and further processed into reports, and this can take 1-2 weeks. Thus, although these reports are extensive and usually rapidly and widely available in electronic format, the data themselves have already expired. In addition, at least in Finland, the data do not represent the outpatient setting, but hospitalised patients and military recruits. New rapid and automated multianalyte tests could potentially help to provide more accurate and real-time data to help health care professionals in infection management and containment, especially in outpatient settings. mariPOC\u00ae (ArcDia International Oy Ltd, Turku, Finland) is an automated, multianalyte antigen test for the rapid detection of respiratory infection pathogens from a single nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate sample [4, 5] . The mariPOC\u00ae respi test allows the detection of nine clinically relevant pathogens from the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The test panel includes: influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza 1-3 viruses (PIV 1, 2, 3) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The automated mariPOC\u00ae analyser has been designed for point-of-care use and it can be connected to laboratory information systems (LIS). The majority (75 %) of positive results are reported within 20 min, while final results are reported after 2 h for low positive and negative samples.",

Samples were taken from patients suffering from typical symptoms of respiratory tract infection, whenever aetiological diagnostics was considered necessary by the attending physician. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and handled as previously described [4, 5] .

Ten percent of the tested samples were positive for RSV and 7 % for IAV (Table 1) . During the annual epidemics, equal amounts of positive IAV and RSV findings were detected. The proportion and the number of positive IAV and RSV findings were highest during the 2011-2012 epidemic Table 2 ). The annual epidemiological peaks of RSV and IAV also occurred almost simultaneously, RSV a few weeks later than IAV (Table 2 and Fig. 3 ).",

The mariPOC\u00ae respi test preliminary results at 20 min showed 99.9 % analytical specificity, and, on average, a maximum 1 out of 100 tested samples gives a false-positive result. A positive preliminary result is true in 97 % of cases, on average. For IAV, the positive predictive value is up to 97.8 %, and for RSV 99.1 % (data not shown). Negative fluorescence readouts (results) are not reported in the preliminary phase, since some may turn positive in the 2 h that it takes for the assay to reach equilibrium. Nevertheless, the negative predictive value of the preliminary results (no results shown) is 98 %, indicating that most of the preliminary negatives remain negative for that particular analyte also after 2 h. Typically, POC tests are rapid, but less sensitive than polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. However, mariPOC\u00ae antigen detection has shown good sensitivity, especially in the detection of influenza viruses and RSV and group A Streptococcus, and the specificities of all methods have been excellent [4, 5, 9] . Ivaska et al. reported that mariPOC\u00ae had, in their study, only a moderate sensitivity for AdV and hMPV compared to PCR, but also noted that, sometimes, DNA/RNA findings by PCR may be clinically non-relevant [4] .

Sharing this information with patients might make it easier for doctors to justify not prescribing antibiotics. Mehil\u00e4inen, a country-wide private health care provider in Finland, already has such a tool, where positive virus results and the numbers of tests performed in the laboratory are updated on a daily basis, and the epidemiological trend is presented in real time to their clinicians and laboratories all over the country.",

Individual users may run 1000-2000 tests a year, a magnitude similar to that reported by official national epidemiological follow-up systems (e.g. the NIHW). Thus, potentially available epidemiological data have reached completely new levels, and this should be put into use more efficiently for real-time epidemiological surveillance. In contrast to conventional rapid assays, the mariPOC\u00ae technique is characterised by an automated results readout. Thus, the analysers could be connected not only to LIS but also via the internet to a national or global database and surveillance system, allowing health care authorities to monitor ongoing infections online. Such a surveillance system would support the control of infectious diseases and epidemics, and provide an 'early warning' system for changes in pathogen activities [10] [11] [12] . Influenza virus, for example, causes milder disease before the epidemic peak arrives. Once the number of positive cases increases, the incidence and proportion of more severe diseases also increase [13] . This would have a high impact both for the individual and for society.",

Although the test's slightly variable sensitivity against different viruses might have some impact on the results, the epidemiological picture produced by the mariPOC\u00ae respi test was well in line with virus results reported from the virology unit at the NIHW. Proportions of AdV and IBV findings detected with mariPOC\u00ae were the same size as those reported in the Register for Infectious Diseases of the NIHW (http://www.thl.fi/ttr/ gen/rpt/tilastot.html). When IAV and RSV results are compared, RSV is detected more frequently with mariPOC\u00ae, whereas higher numbers of IAV are reported in the NIHW register compared to RSV (data not shown). However, the NIHW register is currently updated only monthly, although the data is collected on a weekly basis; thus, it is retrospective and does not provide the current clinical situation. In contrast, mariPOC\u00ae provides real-time data also for end-point users, i.e. clinicians.

Our results show that the seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens start almost simultaneously all over Finland, and only slight variations in epidemiological peaks were detected geographically. Our geographically divided data also showed that the prevalence of different pathogens varied between different areas. For example, no clear RSV peak was detected in South-Eastern Finland, and the IBV epidemic in 2013 was concentrated in Southern Finland. In Northern Europe, IAV epidemics are concentrated in the winter months, and the peak is usually in February [14] . RSV epidemics occur simultaneously with IAV, and the peak is in February, but with a wider time span [14, 15] . Our results were in concordance with these reports: the IAV peak was commonly detected between weeks 7 and 9, whereas the annual RSV peak had a wider range (from week 7 in 2012 to week 14 in 2014).

            "text": "It is commonly known that the annual circulation of different respiratory pathogens follow a certain pattern. For example, IAV and RSV circulation shows a wave-like pattern, whereas adenovirus is present throughout the year. It is also commonly known that RSV causes larger epidemics biannually [15, 20] , which could also be seen in our material: RSV was detected more frequently in samples in 2012 and 2014 compared to 2013 (Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Based on these commonly known patterns for respiratory virus circulation, clinicians probably use this 'educated guess' when they order laboratory tests for their patients. However, this educated guess can also cause bias: if RSV is tested more often every other year, it can be expected to be found more frequently. If the mariPOC\u00ae multianalyte test is used, this forethought has no impact on results. With multianalyte testing, it is possible to get results on several pathogens simultaneously, and although the swab might have been taken to assure RSV positivity, the result might show that the patient actually has an adenovirus or an RSV-pneumococcal co-infection. Our results show that viral co-infection was detected among 0.65 % of the tested samples (3 % of the positive samples), and 67 % of these were double infections, with RSV being the most common virus present in co-infections. Thus, mariPOC\u00ae detects and reports the actual epidemiological situation of respiratory pathogens.",

A comparison of the positive results with the number of tested samples showed that the relative proportion of positive IAV and RSV samples correlated with the number of positive findings per week.
