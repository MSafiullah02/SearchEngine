The pathophysiology of this protozoal disease is complex and unique and still only incompletely understood [2, 3]. In falciparum malaria, the parasite population increases 6- to 20-fold per replication cycle [4], making it the most dangerous of the five species known to affect humans. Life-threatening complications can develop rapidly and in an unpredictable manner. These complications are included in the criteria for severe falciparum malaria defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [5].",

Among these, older age seems to play a key role, since it has consistently been found to be associated with severe malaria in multiple studies [7\u201310]. In the UK, for instance, the adjusted odds ratio of dying of malaria was 10.68 in those > 65 years old compared with the > 18\u201335 year old group [10], but the exact reasons for this association remain to be elucidated. Recently, a nationwide study from Sweden identified diabetes and obesity as two age-related, non-communicable conditions being risk factors for severe imported falciparum malaria [11]. The study also gave evidence that hypertension and cardiovascular diseases may lead to more severe courses. These observations are not only of relevance for industrialized nations, where growing numbers of older individuals with co-morbidities travel to countries where malaria is endemic [12]. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are now the leading risk factors for death in many low and middle-income countries where malaria is endemic [13]. Hence, the question how non-communicable diseases in general, and hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in particular, affect the risk for severe malaria, is principally an issue of major importance.",

Using invasive haemodynamic monitoring Hanson and colleagues demonstrated higher baseline systemic vascular resistance indexes (SVRI) in patients who died from severe malaria compared to survivors [23].

In malaria pathophysiology obstruction of the microcirculation by parasitized red blood cells plays a central role [33]. Pre-existing microangiopathy could thus add to the deleterious effects of microcirculatory blood flow obstruction in acute falciparum malaria. Diabetes mellitus, lipid disorders, and hypertension are key factors for the development of microangiopathy. Arterial hypertension induces two types of diffuse structural changes in the systemic microcirculation: rarefaction and remodelling. Rarefaction refers to an abnormally reduced density of arterioles, capillaries and possibly venules [34]. Remodelling leads to a structural reduction in lumen diameter of resistance small arteries and arterioles [35]. While both structural modifications are seen in hypertensive patients, remodelling seems to play a paramount role in long-term elevation of systemic vascular resistance. In addition to these structural changes, hypertension as well as diabetes induces functional changes in the microvasculature. Hypertension- and diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction leads to reduced bioavailability of local vasodilators (such as NO and prostacyclin) and increased formation of vasoconstrictors and reactive oxygen species, balancing the microvasculature towards vasoconstriction. These functional microvascular changes result in increased systemic vascular resistance and reduced oxygen delivery to target organs [36]. Pre-existing hypertension- and diabetes-associated microangiopathy may thus potentiate the reduced oxygen supply to vital organs caused by imported falciparum malaria, thereby facilitating severe forms of the disease (Additional file 1).",

One of the individual diagnoses responsible for this association was hypertension. With a prevalence of 9.2% hypertension was the single most common chronic condition in the study population. Multivariable analysis was therefore robust and revealed that hypertensive individuals had a threefold increased risk of developing severe imported falciparum malaria compared to patients without hypertension. With increased after-load, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and, most importantly, pre-existing microangiopathy, there were plausible pathophysiologic explanations for this association (Additional file 2).

Yet, endothelial activation and inflammation can persist for up to 28 days after therapy (the so-called \u201cpost-treatment inflammatory effect\u201c) [39]. The supportive therapy must, therefore, meet the specific pathophysiologic requirements of falciparum malaria well beyond completion of antimalarial therapy. Support of the cardiovascular system in severe malaria can be provided by numerous interventions such as correction of hypovolaemia by careful rehydration, controlling tachycardia in atrial fibrillation, maintaining adequate haemoglobin levels in order to ensure sufficient oxygenation\u2014especially in concomitant coronary artery disease\u2014or by providing inotropes in myocardial failure. The data presented here indicate that reducing an increased after-load with appropriate antihypertensives is another important intervention.

Long observation period and monocentric design further add to limited quality of the data. However, severe imported falciparum malaria is a rare condition in most non-endemic regions. Thus, high-quality prospective trials conducted in resource-rich settings will hardly become available in the future. Retrospective analyses, therefore, continue to provide an important source of evidence. Together with a case load of > 500 individuals this allowed for detailed statistical analyses. Since cohorts of patients with imported falciparum malaria will differ in regard to average age, represented ethnicities, immune status, comorbidities, destinations, reason of travel and other important aspects, however, the results cannot be generalized recklessly.

            "text": "Fig.\u00a02: Falciparum malaria pathophysiology interferes with oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues on multiple levels. Oxygen delivery depends on heart rate, stroke volume, haemoglobin level and arterial oxygen saturation. Changes in one parameter can normally be compensated for by others. However, the key elements of falciparum malaria pathophysiology (grey boxes) do not just interfere with all components of oxygen delivery simultaneously, but they may also augment each other. If the capabilities for compensation are limited by pre-existing chronic co-morbidities, development of life-threatening complications such as metabolic acidosis and shock is facilitated. In a recent study from India, for instance, Mohanty et al. demonstrated that clinical and radiologic findings in cerebral malaria are largely consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [40]. Hypertension is one of the known etiologies of PRES.
