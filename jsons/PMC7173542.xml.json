Influenza A and B viruses and RSV also contribute to the cases in the winter and spring. Rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus, and coronaviruses are present through most of the year. In some areas, enteroviruses have an increased prevalence during the summer and fall and bocavirus is prevalent during the fall to spring (see Fig. 61-1).",
