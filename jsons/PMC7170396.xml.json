Hsieh, Chen, and Hsu (2004) synthesize official reports and\ndescribe the rapid spread of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan in detail. The WHO reported\n3,947 probable SARS cases with 229 deaths worldwide on April 22, 2003; China, Hong\nKong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Toronto, Canada, had the most cases. Taiwan, meanwhile,\nhad 29 probable cases and no deaths. Seventy-eight percent of the cases were imported.\nThe growth of the numbers of SARS infections seemed to be a typical minor outbreak at\nthat time. On that day, a new cluster of seven infections in Hoping Hospital in Taipei\nwas reported and it started a chain of local transmissions that cumulated in 116\nprobable cases and 10 deaths in the following two weeks. By mid-May, the numbers grew\nto 264 probable cases and 34 deaths. Subsequently, by June 1, it expanded into 680\nprobable cases and 81 deaths. In a period of less than one month, more than a sixfold\nincrease in the numbers of SARS infections and victims was erupted rapidly in Taiwan.\nThe rapid increase rates of reported probable SARS case-patients and deaths\nundoubtedly would cause a panic nationwide in Taiwan.",

            "text": "In addition to the rapid increase rate of reported probable SARS case-patients, the\nnationwide panic in Taiwan might also be resulted from a sense of the endless and\nuncontrolled expansion of the outbreak. As the disease was spreading so rapidly, the\nhealth authority in Taiwan enforced many stringent measures in order to contain the\noutbreak. In addition to thermal scanning arrivals from abroad to check for signs of\nfever induced by SARS, Hsieh et al. (2004)\nindicate two of the most important stressed measures. One measure was reporting,\nadmitting, and hospitalizing all susceptible patients. The other was the house\nquarantine of people either those with contacts to the suspected case-patients or\narrivals from the affected areas abroad. However, on the first hand, hospitals in\nTaiwan were initially unprepared for and unprotected from the SARS disease. The\npatient quarantine rooms, personal protective equipments for health care workers, and\ngeneral infection control, etc., which had been improved and well prepared\nprofessionally later (Esswein et al., 2004),\nwere relatively insufficient at the beginning of the outbreak. Since frequent\nunprotected or inadequately protected patient-to-health care worker interactions and\ngrouping large numbers of ill persons can greatly amplify intrahospital transmission\n(Gopalakrishna et al., 2004), almost 73\npercent of all traceable infections in Taiwan occurred in hospital settings (Hsieh et al., 2004). It caused inevitably a panic\namong all medical professions on the frontline in the battle against SARS. On the\nother hand, the home quarantine of a number of susceptible people was frequently\nbroken (Hsieh et al., 2004). Just as the\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), it cannot be considered quarantineable not\nonly because of medical but also because of ethical and legal issues (Gensini, Yacoub, & Conti, 2004). Accordingly,\na sense of uncontrollability was emerged publicly at the beginning of the SARS\noutbreak. Furthermore, the local sensationalist media accelerated and amplified the\nresulted panic from the sense of uncontrollability successfully by focusing their\nattention on some intrahospital transmission and out-of-supervised quarantine cases.\nThis phenomenon was consistent with Mason,\nGrabowski, and Du's (2005, p. 17) description of the global media that the\nmedia were much less interested in providing accurate information and more concerned\nwith selling copies of their publication through sensationalist but inaccurate\nstories.",

Pennings, Wansink, and Meulenberg (2002) proposed that the behavior of\nconsumers in a crisis situation can be explained by a combination of risk perception and\nrisk attitude. Whereas risk attitude deals with consumers\u2019 interpretation of the content\nof the risk, the seriousness of adverse consequences, or the extent of risk aversion\ntoward a particular crisis, risk perception instead deals with consumers\u2019 interpretation\nof the chance of being exposed to the content of the risk. Since individuals with\ngreater risk perception were the ones who continued to visit theme parks while those\nwith lower risk perception tended to avoid the patronage, risk perception does not seem\nto be the dominant motivator of theme park visitors. Suppose that risk attitude is the\ntrue motivator behind theme park visitors\u2019 responses to the SARS outbreak. In such a\ncase, Pennings et al. suggest that even if the probabilities of being exposed to the\nrisk are small, effectively communicating these probabilities will have little influence\non consumer behavior. Instead, marketers will have to focus on ways to eliminate the\nrisk. Chien and Law (2003) suggested substantial\nprocesses to minimize hotel employees and guests\u2019 possibility of SARS infection and to\ncontain the potential spread of viruses on the hotel property. The processes can also be\nwell utilized by other businesses or services in the hospitality and tourism industry.\nIn addition to actually implementing the processes of risk elimination, it is equally\nimportant that management should make efforts to let the potential consumers know and\nlet the customers see, smell, hear, and feel the processes of risk elimination on the\nproperty.",

In addition to the substantial\nsuggestions on possible adjustments of marketing mix, some implications can be emerged\nfrom the findings and discussion of this study. It should be firstly noted that, during\na plague outbreak, the impact against tourism industry is primarily generated by the\npanic resulted from the plague rather than by the plague itself. The dominant\ndeterminant in the formulation of the plague-resulted panic tends to be the magnitude of\npeople's aversion (risk attitude) to the plague rather than the perceived possibility to\nbe infected by the plague (risk perception). By the back-up of the media, the scale and\nspread of possible emerged panic tends to be amplified and accelerated extensively. If a\npanic has been prevailed, it might be an inevitable outcome that people tend to\nover-react in their responses to a plague outbreak. People's over-reactions might be\nrepresented by decreasing the amount of consumption or even the collapse of regional\ntourism. According to the subsequence of a plague-outbreak crisis emerging from the\ndiscovery and identification of an epidemic to possible damages suffered by tourism\nindustry, several critical points between different stages of the crisis progression can\nbe found. In terms of crisis management, if the critical points can be well monitored\nand managed, the situation will be substantially better off.",
