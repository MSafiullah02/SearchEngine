Carlson et al. (2017 and references) considered that conservation of parasites is essential to maintain the diversity in major ecosystems, particularly during global climate change. Because parasites are typically small and cryptic and often infect multiple hosts and/or host species during their life cycle, unravelling the life cycles of even a small percentage of parasite species has proven to be challenging. Indeed, while life cycles and life histories have been extensively investigated for a small number of model species (mostly species that impact the health of humans and/or plants and animals of economic importance to humans), we know virtually nothing about the vast majority of species.",

Most males transfer sperm directly to the females using a variety of modified structures on the third and fourth thoracic legs; however, in Dolops, sperm are transferred in chitinous spermatophores. Sperm morphology originally linked fish lice with tongue worms (see Sect. 5.3). Molecular evidence also supports their similarities. Only the life cycle of Argulus is well known (Poly 2008; Neethling and Avenant-Oldewage 2016), and no life cycles of marine species are known. A mature female Argulus leaves its host and lays eggs in rows on a hard, submerged surface (Fig. 5.1). As many as 1200 eggs are laid at any one time and are cemented to the substrate. The eggs hatch 12\u201380 days later, varying by species and water temperature. Eggs hatch into (1) free-swimming metanauplius-like larvae (7 species of Argulus), (2) free-swimming juvenile-like larvae (4 Argulus, 2 Dolops) or (3) non-swimming larvae (6 Chonopeltis Thiele, 1900). The three larval stages (above) moult into second-stage juveniles, which are parasitic and repeatedly change hosts (serial parasite). The 8\u201312 stages before the adult are also parasitic and host-hopping*. The maxillule undergoes a profound metamorphosis around the fifth stage, changing from a long limb bearing a powerful distal claw, into a short but powerful circular sucker (Martin et al. 2014). This is a remarkable transformation. M\u00f8ller et al. (2007) described swimming and self-cleaning in the hatching, free-swimming stage and the subsequent juvenile stages of Argulus foliaceus.\n",

They have seven to eight free-living, developmental stages and are said to have intermediate hosts, but, as in other fish lice, these are really transfer hosts*. All host infection and reinfection are through host contact with the bottom. Intermediate hosts are small, bottom-dwelling fishes, and the definitive hosts are larger, bottom-dwelling fishes (Grundlingh 1996). How they infect or attach to hosts is still unknown, possibly only floating to a new host (Fryer 1961; Piasecki and Avenant-Oldewage 2008).",

            "text": "Few parasite embryos have ever had mutualistic symbionts, but Banerjee et al. (2016) have found one. A rotifer, Philodina roseola Ehrenberg, 1832, feeds off the jelly coat of the egg strips of Argulus bengalensis Ramakrishna, 1951. This makes the coating thin enough for larvae to break out. If the rotifer does not feed, the larvae cannot emerge. They suggested this knowledge of the life cycle could afford parasite control. Van As and Van As (2015) found adult and larvae Chonopeltis lisikili Van As & Van As, 1996, on the same host specimens and suggested host-change does not occur in C. lisikili, as was reported for other Chonopeltis spp. These stages, and free-swimming adults, are attracted by bright objects, light, and motion, as Mikheev et al. (2015) demonstrated in aquarium studies. In daylight, the parasite employed hover-and-wait tactics with low swimming speed and an inclined position of the body. In the dark, cruising tactics were employed, characterised by a much higher swimming speed and a horizontal position of the body. Vision, olfaction and mechanoreception are used in daylight, whereas only the latter two are used at night. Swimming speed was 5\u20136 times greater at night than in the daylight. Host-induced cues increased mean swimming speed by a factor of 1.5\u20133. In adults starved for 1\u20132 days, the swimming speed was 3\u20134 times greater than those freshly detached from the host. A longer starvation caused a decrease in swimming activity (Mikheev et al. 2015).",

However, these effects seem too inadvertent, reactive, and temporal, to be called parasite-induced host behavioural changes. They do not help the individual parasite causing the reaction, possibly even harming it, similar to a positive precursor. They are certainly nothing like the host behaviour changes such as found in parasitic barnacles. Mikheev et al.

Gravid females of Armillifer Sambon, 1922, and Linguatula Fr\u00f6lich, 1789, species may contain millions of eggs. The eggs of cephalobaenids are stored in a saccate uterus until they contain 30\u201350% fully mature primary larva and are infectious; then egg deposition begins. The vagina is equipped with a sieve-like mechanism only allowing mature eggs to escape. They lay eggs in the respiratory track of vertebrates, which are either coughed or sneezed out by the host or leave the host body through the digestive system. Usually, an insect or vertebrate ingests the eggs. The larva hatches into a nymph, penetrates the intestinal wall, and forms a cyst in the intermediate host\u2019s body. The nymph is rounded in form, with 4\u20136 short legs. The final host is infected when it eats the intermediate host, and the nymph crawls into the respiratory tract from the oesophagus or stomach. It moults several times to become a post-larval juvenile and finally an adult. A few species, mostly in birds, have direct life cycles. Subtriquetra subtriquetra (Diesing, 1836), in South American crocodiles, is the only tongue worm known to have a free-swimming larva.

The egg usually hatches into a nauplius larva with a small, unsegmented body, and three pairs of functional appendages (antennules, antennae and mandibles). A maximum of six naupliar stages can occur, and all six are found in most free-living copepods and in some parasites. Nauplii may be planktotrophic (feed on plankton) or rely on its yolk (lecithotrophic). Parasitic nauplii are usually lecithotrophic, have reduced setation on the three limb pairs, and no naupliar feeding process on the coxae of the antenna. In many parasites, the naupliar phase is abbreviated or occasionally lost. The final nauplius stage moults to become the first copepodid with a segmented body, a full adult set of cephalic appendages, and the first and second swimming legs. Free-living copepods have a maximum of five copepodid stages with one body somite added at each moult. In almost all copepod parasites, copepodid I is a free-swimming stage. Only Parachordeumium aphiurae (H\u00e9rouard, 1906) and internal sea cucumber copepods have copepodid II hatching from their eggs (Martin et al. 2014). Copepodid I is in the typical crustacean form with two pairs of biramous swimming legs, each with 1-segmented rami. It begins free-living but is usually the infective stage. The copepodid stages provide a gradual transition from the copepodid body form to adult morphology, however transformed. In the more derived families, successive copepdid stages have increasing modifications in body form and limb structures. The fifth copepodid stage moults into an adult male or female. Following this moult, the female becomes sexually receptive.\n",

Cleaners may bite and injure crustacean parasites that are too large for them to remove (Cleaner nipping*). Cleaner nipping is a widespread, important, but hitherto unrecognised, life history peril for ectoparasites. Mahmoud et al.

The first copepodid usually attaches and develops through copepodid stages on the gills of a fish host. This may occur on the definitive host specimen, on a different specimen of the same species, or on a different species of fish. In the final copepodid stage, the female usually leaves the gills and attaches on the body of the same fish specimen (direct) or on a different one (indirect). Thus, a real intermediate host can occur, but this is not obligatory. Some of these species may be evolving towards an obligate intermediate host.

All the copepodid stages are parasitic. Copepodid V, called subimago by Su\u00e1rez-Morales et al. (2014), is the emergent stage. It moults rather quickly into an adult after it leaves the host. The adults are nonfeeding, free-swimming, reproductive, and pelagic. Most copepods produce egg sacs or spawn freely in the water column, but larval parasitic copepod females attach their eggs on their long, ovigerous spines with mucous secreted by the terminal part of the oviduct. Egg masses are produced iteratively corresponding to when the ovigerous spines grow. Eggs hatch into lecithotrophic nauplii that locate a mollusc or polychaete host and burrow into its tissues. They metamorphose into sac-like naupliar stage in the host\u2019s blood system. Two antero-ventral root-like processes absorb nourishment from the host. This stage is like no other crustacean larvae. Development continues endoparasitically until the last copepodid escapes from the host and undertakes a single moult into a reproductive adult. Su\u00e1rez-Morales et al. (2014) described the first copepodids (III, IV, V) in detail, finding copepodid V to be pre-emergent and emergent.",

            "text": "The full copepod life cycle occurs in many families of siphon-mouth copepods, especially those utilising invertebrates as hosts, such as asterocherids and cancerillids. In parasitic copepods, the infective larva is, with rare exceptions, the first copepodid, and life cycles are direct, involving only a single host. In fish parasites, the nauplius phase is reduced to two lecithotrophic stages and has uniseriate egg strings in which disc-shaped eggs are closely packed into one row extending the length of the string; and most nauplii have a single pair of modified caudal setae known as balancers (function unknown). Related families with multiseriate egg strings, such as lernaeopodids, sphyriids, and two genera of hatschekiids, have nauplii lacking balancers. In some lernaeopodids (Allela Leigh-Sharpe, 1925; Clavella Oken, 1815; and Nectobranchia Hesse, 1863), the nauplius phase is reduced to one stage. In other lernaeopodids and some pennellids (Salmincola Wilson, 1915; Cardiodectes Wilson, 1917; and Peroderma Heller, 1865), it is lost completely, and eggs hatch directly into the infective first copepodid. Life cycle abbreviation also occurs in some parasites of invertebrates. The Herpyllobiidae and the genus Trochicola Dollfus, 1914, have only two naupliar stages, and only one nauplius is known for Gonophysema Bresciani & L\u00fctzen, 1960, and for some genera of nicothoids. In other genera of nicothoids, some chordeumiids, and cucumaricolids, there is no nauplius stage. Izawa (2010) experimentally showed that there could be five naupliar stages in Gangliopus pyriformis Gerstaecker, 1854. In most fish parasites, the first copepodid secrets a chitinous frontal filament from an anteriorly located gland, soon after it settles on the host. This filament anchors the developing chalimus larva securely to its host (Rohde 2005).",

This attention is due to the damage that they cause cage cultured fishes, particularly of salmonids (Lafferty et al. 2015). Knowing the correct life cycle is critical in determining when to treat for the damaging stages. Caligid sea lice were thought to have four chalimus stages and one or two pre-adult stages. Several recent papers have challenged this scenario (e.g. Hamre et al. 2013; Venmathi Maran et al. 2013). They found that the typical caligid life cycle comprised eight stages: two naupliar, one copepodid, and four chalimus stages preceding the adult in Caligus M\u00fcller, 1778, but with the four chalimus stages represented by two chalimus and two pre-adult stages in Lepeophtheirus Heegaard, 1943. This is a profound change with significant implications for the aquaculture industry. As the typical caligid life cycle may not exist, it may be necessary to determine the life cycle of every species of damaging sea louse. Again, only 3.8% (17) of life cycles are known for 450 caligid species (Venmathi Maran et al. 2013).",

The contamination of the environment by salmon sea lice from fish farms is a politically and economically important question that has received recent attention. Serra-Llinares et al. (2016) found that farms increase the infection of local, wild salmonids. They also noted Thorstad et al. (2015), and others strongly suggested the transmission of lice from farm salmon to wild salmonids in systems where the fish occur in close vicinity. These adult caligids can freely swim between hosts (host hop*) and build up in fish cages. Few parasitic copepods have this life-history advantage (serial parasites). The filtering effect of cages tends to concentrate sea lice. Adult male and female caligids are frequently found in plankton samples (Venmathi Maran and Ohtsuka 2008). They must spend considerable periods free-swimming off hosts. Some species have even been described only from the plankton, and their hosts remain unknown.",

The CI is infective (found in galls; Izawa 2008) and settles from the plankton onto a host and forms a cyst or gall under the skin on the fins or body of a variety of different bony, coral reef fishes. Lewis (1964) found surgeonfishes (acanthurids) were preferred in Hawai\u2019i. However, parrotfishes were preferred in Puerto Rico (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). The cysts are open posteriorly for respiration (mesoparasite). After feeding, developing, and moulting through CI\u2013CIV, the fifth copepodid emerges from the cyst leaving a moulted exoskeleton behind. Lewis (1964) found these forms were soft and pliant, which he interpreted to be of value in leaving their cysts. It was actually because they had recently moulted. The CV then swims out and searches for a shark definitive host. There could be some predator transfer involved since the copepodids are in hosts preyed upon by sharks. The encysted copepod life cycle* is the only mesoparasitic life cycle known in parasitology and only the second obligate intermediate host life cycle discovered in copepod parasites of fishes. Many tapeworm (cestode) shark parasites have bony fish intermediate hosts, but this is the first crustacean one ever discovered.",

They examined thousands of nearshore, planktonic fishes, found 3% infected, and 1% infected by multiple species. They thus opened a completely new dimension into parasitic life strategies, which we have termed planktonic juvenile fish infection*. Juveniles of a single host species have sometimes been examined for parasites (e.g. Nielson et al. 1987; Herrera 1990), but masses of juveniles have seldom been studied (e.g. Herrera 1984; Felley et al. 1987; Cribb et al. 2000). Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2015) concluded these juvenile fishes were intermediate hosts for these copepods. However, caligids are not known to have intermediate hosts, and pennellid intermediate hosts are adult fish or squids. They had also concluded the copepods would mature too soon to develop with the host fishes. However, we believe the hosts and the parasites will grow up together in these cases. Alternatively, these may be small predators* feeding on juvenile fishes as a part of their life cycles (Table 5.1). Whichever is the case, this extends and prolongs life cycles further than we had imagined. Interestingly, only copepods are taking advantage of this resource, not only among crustacean parasites but also among all parasites. Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2015) also searched for internal parasites and found none.\n",

Adults are sessile, with females consisting of a sac attached to the crab host (externa) (Fig. 5.5) with rootlets of tissue flowing cancer-like through the host\u2019s body (interna) and dwarf males inside the female. Some females sequentially only produce male larvae from large eggs, female larvae from small eggs or mixed sexes. They have the usual naupliar instars and infective cyprid; however, in some species, embryos develop directly into cypris larvae before adult females release them. The nauplii are smaller than those found in other barnacles, which may be necessary to produce them in much greater numbers. The larvae are lecithotrophic. The cypris are usually at least 2 days old before they settle on a host. In kentrogonids, male cyprids are larger than female ones. Some have a naupliar eye, and others have compound eyes. Injection of the vermigon (the migratory internal stage) happens within 1\u20133 days after settlement. When many male larvae exist, only the fastest and strongest will succeed. When there are few males, the female remains receptive longer. When a virgin is found, the male cyrid must settle close to the orifice, enter the brood chamber, and inject a trichogon stage. The trichogon looks like a verogon, except with a spiny collar. It becomes a dwarf male and reaches one of two male receptacles. Once established, the dwarf male undergoes spermatogenesis and is nourished by the female parasite for the duration of its life (cryptogonochorism). The male cypris of akentrogonids penetrate the host or the virgin female with their antennules and without a kentrogon or trichogon. A single male can fertilise all the broods of the female. A female externa produces several batches of larvae and drops off the host just before the host moults. A new, young externa is produced from the interna and emerges from the host body (Waiho et al. 2017).\n",

They have a characteristic bobbing motion when swimming that makes them easy to distinguish in plankton samples. The function and homology of the naupliar horn pores and dorsocaudal organs have been much debated but remain uncertain. They are either planktotrophic or lecithotrophic. Only lecithotrophic nauplii have been raised through all five instars. Planktotrophic nauplii have food visible in their stomachs. Unlike barnacle larvae, the y-cyprid is constantly swimming. This larva is distinctively the costracan. The y-cyprid has a univalved carapace that only partially covers the larval body and resembles an inverted boat but with elongated sharp posterior ends (Fig. 5.6). Paired compound eyes lie anteriorly in the body with antennules, labrum, paraocular processes, postocular filamentary tufts, and two pairs of rudiments of antennae and mandibles underneath (ventrally). The antennules have four segments. All larval stages are free-living and semitransparent. The cyprid does not feed. A number of species have been described based only on a y-cyprid (N = 7) or even a y-nauplii (N = 4). As with barnacles, the cyprid seeks a host to infect. It has compound eyes, is ambulatory with its antennae, and can produce an adhesive glue. Recently, possible juvenile forms have been produced by treating y-cyprid with the hormone\n20-hydroxyecdysone to stimulate ecdysis and the transition to the next life cycle phase. The resulting slug-like, unsegmented, and limbless form was called \u2018ypsigon\u2019 (Fig. 5.6). It is formed in the cypris and escapes from its body (Glenner et al. 2008). This may be a juvenile. See H\u00f8eg et al. (2014) for more detailed descriptions, illustrations, and photographs.\n",

A-nauplii have an oval, bowl-shaped head shield, which is broader anteriorly, and setiform frontal filaments. A-cypris have a bivalve carapace and antennules with hooked claws. Echinoderm copebarnacles brood their larvae and only release a-cypris, while coral copebarnacles release nauplii. Usually, six naupliar instars (sometimes two brooded) are followed by one to two cypris-like stages (a-cypris, ascothoracid larvae) (similar to the cirripede single cypris and the y-cypris of y-parasites). Many are lecithotrophic, but some species are planktotrophic. Coral copebarnacles a-cypris occur in the plankton. The a-cypris (ascothoracid-larva) attaches by grasping antennules rather than by glandular secretions as in cirripede cyprids. When two a-cyprid instars occur, the second is the settlement stage. Many species have an abbreviated ontogeny, and the entire naupliar phase is sometimes brooded or embryonised. No complete life cycle is known for any copebarnacle. Neither host infection, nor copulation has ever been observed. Most females have seminal receptacles on their legs, but not in dendrogastrids. Some male a-cyprids have testes with mature sperm and possibly fertilise the females through the pore in the host. Some dwarf males sit close to the aperture, and others live in the mantle cavity of the female. The transition from a bivalved stage to a sac-like carapace is suspected to occur in one moult, but this remains unresolved. A \u2018post-larval\u2019 stage of females and males has been discovered, and second-stage a-cyprids, ready to moult to the male stage, have been observed. The cypris for the modified, enlarged female, and dwarf males of Gorgonian copebarnacles (Gorgonolaureus Utinomi, 1962) are not known. The complete life cycle is equally not known (Kolbasov et al. 2015). Three-five naupliar instars occur.

            "text": "Mating occurs on a host jelly, males depart, and ovigerous females remain on the host while brooding the eggs. Brood sizes range from 50 to several hundred eggs. The eggs are relatively small for amphipods. Larval stages are in the female marsupium. The first stage is the pantochelis larva with four cheliform pereopods and unsegmented and limbless metasoma and urosome. The pantochelis stage metamorphoses into a \u2018protopleon\u2019 larva (often divided into three sub-stages), having a segmented metasome and imperfect pleopods. In many species, there is no pantochelis stage, and the egg hatches directly into a first protopleon stage. The last (or only) protopleon stage gives rise to the first juvenile stage (a miniature adult) and marks the demarsupiation or the deposition by the female of the larvae (in rare cases the juveniles) into a host. During demarsupiation, the gravid female swims out to find a host and deposits one or a few larvae upon the host specimen (depending on host size and capacity). She continues infecting one host after another. Some females penetrate a host, split a gonad with its mouthparts, and inserts the larvae deeply into the organ. As they grow, the juveniles leave the gonad and start feeding on the prey trapped by the host. Some females deposit pantochelis larvae on the surface of salps with their specialised seventh pereopods. When the larvae moult a few hours later, the ensuing protopleon larvae enter the branchial cavity and eat its wall or feeds on the collected suspended matter. Once the host can no longer support the young as they mature, they leave it for another salp in the chain. Species of phronimids excavate solitary salps or pyrosomes into \u2018barrels\u2019 open at both ends and in which they hide and use as a nursery. The larvae are demarsupiated into the barrel where they soon bunch together into a tight cluster that slowly moves around on the inner barrel wall. The female stays with the barrel and prevents the young from passing to the outer surface. At intervals, she makes short excursions into the water and returns with prey to feed her brood. The pereopods are used to maintain the position of the animal within the barrel, and beating of the pleopods propels the combined barrel-jelly parasitoids through the water (bio-jet ski).",

They also named a new species, Megalanceoloides aequanime Gasca, 2017, based on a redescription of M. remipes (Barnard 1932) in Gasca and Haddock (2016), distributions, sizes, and a few morphological differences. We name Megalanceoloides gascae n. sp. based on the descriptions by Vinogradov (1964) and Vinogradov et al. (1996) of \u2018M. remipes\u2019. We also distinguish M. gascae from M. remipes on the basis of geographical distributions in the northern Indian Ocean (Vinogradov 1964) vs southwest Atlantic (Barnard 1932; USNM 301871, 1090231), south-east Pacific (USNM 1090233, 1090237), and Antarctic Ocean (USNM 1090236). The former three records represent two new locality records. The two species are further distinguished based on the sizes of females, 19 mm female (Vinogradov 1964) vs 40 mm male (Barnard 1932), and morphological differences discussed by Gasca and Haddock (2016). The holotype is the specimen collected by Vinogradov (1964: 114\u2013117, by monotypy ICZN 1999: Art 73.1.2) and also in illustrated ions by Vinogradov (1964: Figs. 4, 5) and Vinogradov et al. (1996: Fig. 26) (ICZN 1999: Art 72.5.6, 73.1.4). The new species is the third in the Megalanceoloides remipes species complex and in genus Megalanceoloides Zeidler, 2009.",

This process was slowly and methodically repeated, although the complete release was not observed. Adlard and Lester (1995) found it took 1\u20133 h in the lab. The juveniles swam upwards towards the surface. Some authors have mistaken our burst release (Williams and Williams 1985c) with the normal release process. Burst release occurs when a host is caught or struck. All juveniles are released at once even if they are not quite mature (pre-manca and manca; Williams and Williams 1985c).

            "text": "The second problem with most \u2018complete\u2019 life cycles is they do not include the free-swimming juvenile stages. We have found up to six stages (Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1994; and see below). The fish isopod manca juvenile has six pairs of legs. Most manca juveniles are much more setose than later juvenile stages. The final juvenile has seven pairs of legs. Intermediate juveniles may have 6.25-, 6.5-, and/or 6.75-leg pairs. Some suggest escaping mancae require a free-swimming period before they can attach to hosts; however, Thatcher (2000) found they were ready to attach to fishes as soon as they left the brood pouch, and Williams and Williams (1985c) reported that Anilocra chromis Williams & Williams, 1981, and Cymothoa oestrum (Linnaeus, 1758) could attach immediately. Large samples of all post-manca juvenile stages (C. oestrum) have only been examined by Williams and Bunkley-Williams (1994). Juveniles are positively phototaxic and can be captured in light traps at night. They swim to the surface light when released from the female. They can also be captured with surface plankton nets during the day. They thus appear to avoid the diurnal planktivores on the reef. Adlard and Lester (1995) found they rested at the surface of the water with their hooks (dactyls) through the day, but this was demonstrated in aquaria and not in the field. They descend back to the reef at night and can be caught near the bottom with diver-towed plankton nets. Some have suggested juveniles must feed within 1\u20132 days to survive (Lester 2005). However, manca juveniles, unfed, for more than a week, are still capable of infecting hosts. Adlard and Lester (1995) reported that only half of the mancae were infective after 8 days. Juveniles of Glossobius hemiramphi and Livoneca ovalis (Say, 1818) use resting hosts before locating their final hosts. Cook and Munguia (2015) found mancae of Cymothoa excisa Perty, 1833 had a window of 7 days to infect hosts. Juveniles of L. ovalis are micro-males since an adult male has never been found. Resting hosts are commonly used by many species (Thatcher 2000) and may be a part of the normal life cycle. This predisposes them to becoming micro-males.",

A juvenile attaches to a host and begins to develop through a series of instars: juvenile-male transitional, immature male, male, male-female transitional, immature female, virgin female (no oostegites), and ovigerous female. The second juvenile that arrives will cease developing and remain as a male, with development hormonally controlled by the female. If the female dies, the associated male resumes developing into a female. Anilocra Leach, 1818, juveniles replace solitary dead females. Williams and Bunkley-Williams (unpublished data) have often seen a juvenile attached in the attachment scar where a female was formerly located. Micro-males may be attracted to dying females and begin to develop into females protected underneath the \u2018cougar\u2019 (old female).

Furthermore, size alone does not determine supra-stages or instars (see size discussion below). Their Fs-4 would be our vegetative* supra-female (Sf-2).

For example, we have seen normally under-eye Anilocra attach above the eye or on top of the head when both of their normal sites were occupied. These are the normal attachment sites for other species of isopods and may help to explain how utilisation of different sites evolved. We found 13 longsnout bullhead sculpins*, most with female Elthusa sp. isopods in their gill chambers and males underneath the females. However, we also found three males, of the same size and species, attached in two of the same hosts on the body near the opercular openings (Fig. 5.10). The evolution of gill-dwelling isopods into external attaching isopods has been previously hypothesised (Brusca 1981) but never demonstrated. These normal female-male gill-chamber-dwelling isopods with externally attaching cohorts represent the first ever observation of an example of this event (Fig. 5.10).\n",

These differences have caused many taxonomic problems. Adult females moult on the host in two parts. This is probably necessary to have some hardening of the pereopods to maintain attachment on the host. We have seen this many times on Anilocra spp. where the posterior part is shed usually posterior to the 3rd pereon, sometimes the 4th. There must be a considerable delay between moult halves, or we would have never seen so many. We call these mid-moult stages. The delay allows the new hooks (dactyls) to harden before the last anterior segments are shed. We have seen mid-moult stages with a large posterior body and a much smaller anterior body (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). We have also seen mid-moult stages in four wild Cymothoa oestrum juveniles (Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1994).",

We studied 120 specimens (85 infected) of doctorfish with 0\u20138 specimens of two species of adult isopods and noted there was no difference in condition factors (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). The isopods cause the host to grow more slowly, but they remain proportional (proportional stunting). \u00d6stlund-Nilsson et al. (2005) also found no conditional factor difference and summarised the literature on this topic. A male-female pair of Livoneca redmanii in each gill chamber of mackerel will cause a decline in condition factor and often kills the host (Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1996). Lanzing and O\u2019Connor (1975) also found host condition was only reduced in multiple isopod infections. However, Robinson (2005) found a reduced condition in bicolor damselfish infected with single Anilocra partiti Williams & Williams, 1981 females, and Sala-Bonzano et al. (2012) found no condition factor effect of Ceratothoa italica Schioedte & Meinert, 1883, on sand steenbras in a protected area, but severe effects in a similar overfished (unprotected) area.

Meadows and Meadows (2002) suspected this was also a host behavioural change caused by the isopod. Welicky and Sikkel (2015) were not certain if infected fish had less energy to migrate or if uninfected cohorts harassed them. However, all four behaviour modifications, caused by the isopods, accomplished the same availability of manca juveniles to infect juvenile and young fishes. We will call this effect nursery hiding. These are newly recognised life cycle innovations caused by parasite modification of its host behaviour.",

After juveniles were found in apparent copula with females, we assumed that juveniles were functioning as males. To test this assumption, individual juveniles were raised on their host, periodically preserved, sectioned, and stained. The infective, 6-leg juvenile was a functional male as were all intermediates up to and including the 7-leg juvenile. However, as soon as a juvenile began to obtain an adult shape (juvenile-male transitional), it began to lose its male characters. Only juveniles were reproductive males. This resolved the \u2018mystery of missing males\u2019. We refer to this reproductive juvenile as a micro-male. Juveniles with full male characters have been found in several species, but these have never been suspected to be sexually active. Many species are known to use paratenic hosts (Thatcher 2000; Bakenhaster et al. 2006), which may predispose them to becoming micro-males.",

In off-reef areas in Venezuela, these juveniles were found on adult glasseye (Bunkley-Williams et al. 2006). They may sense the pheromones of receptive females, leave this micro-male host, swim to the female, crawl under her, and mate belly-to-belly. We have observed them in copula and found a semen string when they were separated. They may hide under the female either before or after copulation, return to their micro-male host, or find another small host. They may eventually locate a juvenile of their definitive host and develop into a female as their host develops. No adult male stage exists.

Nerocila spp. occur around but are unable to penetrate any distance into the Caribbean (Bunkley-Williams et al. 1998; Bunkley-Williams and Williams 1999); and Renocila spp. only infect a few small species (Fig. 5.11; Williams and Williams 1980). The apparent advantages of this life cycle include the following:It allows the female to grow larger on the host because no resources are used by a male partner (Fig. 5.8).Two females may be supported by a host, instead of a male-female pair (Fig. 5.11).Larger females produce more offspring and two females twice as many.It protects vulnerable juveniles from cleaners.It produces greater genetic diversity as many micro-males are available at different times to fertilise each female, instead of one permanent male partner.The abundance and close proximity of numerous micro-males solve the problem of finding a mate.Micro-males form a quick reserve available for developing new females.Micro-males become sexually mature quicker than true males.The energy necessary for a female to hormonally control a male partner is unnecessary.Larger-growing females quickly become too large for cleaner organisms to threaten.Micro-males can parasitise smaller hosts that do not seek out cleaner organisms.Micro-males can easily change host specimens and/or species and are thus more flexible and resilient.Micro-males could potentially use up the resources of one host and just move to another with little effort or danger.The lack of host specificity in micro-males allows them to exploit a broader and more available food supply and to be more flexible and resilient.The time a planktonic reproductive form has to locate a final host is almost infinitely extended by being able to exploit a broad range of more available smaller fishes.Copulation while on the outside of a fish host is easier and safer with a tiny micro-male than with a larger and more bulky \u2018true\u2019 male.This life cycle also resolves the classic question of the expense of sexual reproduction, since all adults produce eggs.It maintains, or even multiplies, the advantage of diversity in sexual reproduction while not sacrificing the productivity advantage of asexual reproduction.\n\n",

Three cases of natural prey-to-predator isopod transfers have been described (Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1994; Williams et al. 2010; Aguilar-Perera et al. 2018), and adult and juvenile isopods have successfully, experimentally, been transferred between the same and different host species (e.g. Williams et al. 1982). The attack of a predator or its feeding action may dislodge an isopod from a transfer host or the isopod may abandon the host. Swallowing a single prey fish may be too fast for a transfer, but with a mouthful of prey fishes, adequate time may exist for a transfer. All transfers need not be successful, just enough.",

We have described burst release (Williams and Williams 1985c), which is female isopods reacting to predator attack by dumping, and thus saving all her juveniles in her marsupium. These juveniles immediately attach to anything including humans. If juveniles react this way to attack, and adults are known to switch hosts, why would juveniles in a prey host not transfer to a predator?",

Zuphea are the first juvenile stage of fish gnats that leave the female, find a host, gorge and swell up with blood, and become the second stage called \u2018praniza\u2019. The praniza eventually drops off the host and finds a secluded place on the bottom to develop into the next zuphea (Z2). Z2 swims up, finds a host, and repeats the cycle (P2). Zuphea feeding times vary from a few hours to a few days with Z3s taking the longest. They can be as short as an hour on coral reef fishes. Zuphea may attack, feed off (snack*), and kill larval or juvenile fishes as smaller predators*. Eventually, P3 moults into an adult (Fig. 5.12). In some species, in genera Elaphognathia Monod, 1926, Gnathia, and Paragnathia Omer-Cooper & Omer-Cooper, 1916, this occurs in one moult. In one species in genus Caecognathia Dollfus, 1901, the first moult results in a pre-adult, which later moults into an adult. We call these feeding and metamorphing units serial parasites, which is somewhat similar to the life cycle found in ticks (arachnids). Praniza may only stay on bony fishes for a few hours but on sharks and rays for weeks. Complete life cycles vary from short to lengthy, directly in relation to seawater temperature: polar (~4\u20135 years), temperate (~2 years males, ~1 year females), and tropical (~2 months) (Smit et al. 2003). Life cycle fluctuations appear to be seasonal in most species but could be dependent on host availability in some. Adults are benthic, nonfeeding, and semelparous.\n",

Juvenile fish gnats on fishes often cannot be identified morphologically as the taxonomy is based on adult males, although this is beginning to change in recent studies (Jones et al. 2008). Fish gnats on coral reefs appear most active at night (Sikkel et al. 2006), although this may not be the case in other environments. At least in the eastern Caribbean, diel activity appears to be related to both life history stage and sex (Sikkel et al. 2006). Fish gnats appear to be generalists. They are known to parasitise 61 families in 18 orders of fishes; however, some fishes are infected more often and more heavily (Tanaka 2007; Coile et al. 2014). This could be attributable to some combination of preference, host susceptibility, and/or host behaviour. Fish gnats may even appear on pelagic fishes (Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1996). For example, amberjack (Carangidae), which fed near the bottom, have been infected with fish gnats, and fish species which did not feed near the bottom were free of gnathiids (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). Coile et al. (2014) found fish gnats, which fed on more susceptible hosts, produced larger, presumably more successful offspring.",

Brood sizes vary from a few to almost 200 and may vary by female size and environmental conditions (Coile et al. 2014 and citations).",

The small Atlantic cleaner gobies, with small mouths, swallow fish gnats whole. In contrast, the bigger, Indo-Pacific cleaner wrasses, with larger mouths, appear to bite them into pieces (Williams et al. 1996). Some of these cleaners selectively feed on larger gnathiids (Grutter 1997). With implications for our understanding of cleaning symbioses, cleaner fishes often do not eat the fish gnats that are not gorged with blood. Is this because the blood-swollen ones are more easily found? Or is this due to preference by cleaners for fish blood rather than gnats without blood?",

The microniscan attaches externally to a pelagc calanoid copepod, pierces its cuticle to feed on its blood, and undergoes six moults and becomes a cryptoniscan (cryptoniscus and cryptoniscid). When it drops off its copepod host, it seeks a crab or shrimp definitive host in the earliest post-larval stage. On the host, it develops into a juvenile (bopyridium) and then into a female. The first cryptoniscan arriving at a host becomes a female and the second, a male (epigametic sex determination). The female attracts a male with pheromones and hormonally controls it to remain a male similar to cymothoids. The female grows large, while the male remains a dwarf attached to the female.",

Females only mate once and store the sperm to fertilise all their batches of eggs. The eggs are released onto the female\u2019s abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material, and protected there during embryonic development. Females with eggs are called \u2018berried\u2019 (as are all egg-carrying decapods) because the eggs resemble round berries. When development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the gall; they pass out into the water and become part of the plankton. Zoea have a tall dorsal spine and may have additional spines for predator deterrence. The zoea of most species must find food (planktonic), but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can live off the yolk (lecithotrophic). Larval development is scarcely known for coral enveloped crabs but is thought to consist of at least five, and possibly seven, planktonic larval stages (Van Der Meij 2014). Different species may have various numbers of zoeal stages, separated by moults, before they change into a megalopa stage. This last larval stage resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. Megalopae settle in hole, cracks, or creases in living corals. After one more moult, the crab is a juvenile. The coral grows around the crab, and somehow the crab forms a gall to its particular specifications. Females become sexually mature after the 4th instar in the gall but continue to enlarge until the 7th instar. They somehow manage to enlarge the gall. They produce multiple broods of eggs fertilised by the first mating.",

These crabs form their gall to their own size and design. Related crab species form similar galls; therefore, the galls have phylogenic importance (Wei et al. 2013). Some galls are too closed to be accessible to males. These females copulate before the gall closes, store sperm, and produce up to eight broods over the next 10 months (Vehof et al. 2016).

However, we documented the first record of predation on a male, and probably at night, since it was by a cardinalfish, on a coral reef in Okinawa (Williams and Williams 1986c). Pea crabs find females by their pheromones. Male crabs sometimes must rub, or tickle, bivalve mollusc hosts for hours to make them open up (Trottier and Jeffs 2015). Once in the host, they copulate with the female, who never leaves the host. Thus, females can become relatively larger (still only pea-size) to produce eggs, while the polygamous males are smaller and flatter to sneak in and out of hosts. In hosts with more roomy accommodations, males may reside with females. Females carry egg masses attached to the pleopods, where they develop until they hatch into zoeae.",

Complexity makes parasites more resilient, adaptable, and in the case of marine anchor worms more able to switch major host groups. Severity is how voraciously and efficiently parasites use host resources to successfully reproduce the most. Some of the most severely parasitic crustaceans actually have rather simple life cycles (e.g. parasitic barnacles and Sarcotaces). The elaborate modification of adults is also sometimes equated to severity. Again, these may co-exist but are different.",

In addition, host tissues growing around their parasites indicate long-term association. Younger hosts are easier to find and infect often occurring in inshore schools.

They must be less like the free-living crustacean stages (e.g. fish lice and fish isopods) and/or must add more parasitic stages in real intermediate hosts (e.g. tongue worms). They can either convert their free-living stages to parasitism or metamorphose new parasitic stages. Those few that have developed parasitic larval or juvenile parasitic stages are progressing. However, the free-living adults many retain must become parasitic. Adults must also become more modified and adapted to a parasitic existence. Crab barnacles have done a pretty good job of this, and a few copepod adults are well modified, but in general, crustaceans have done a terrible job of adapting to and exploiting parasitism.",

We here precisely define these terms.\nAbandon host\u2014when parasites evacuate a host that has been captured, injured, incapacitated, or poisoned.\nAccidental attachment\u2014(a) a host-specific parasite rarely attaching to an accidental host or (b) a site-specific parasite rarely attaching in a different position.\nAccidental (incidental) host\u2014(a) a host on which the parasite cannot complete its life cycle; (b) also used for very rarely infected hosts on which the life cycle can be completed.\nAegathoa\u2014a juvenile genus used for Cymothoidae juveniles that could not be identified to genus and as such is a form genus. This should no longer be used, but inexplicably, recent uses exist.\nAesthetascs\u2014chemosensory organs on the antennae and other structures of larval crustaceans used to locate appropriate hosts, virgin females, etc.\nAggregation\u2014(a) usually refers to the distribution of parasites within hosts. Often, these are not uniformly distributed among host but aggregated in a few hosts; (b) can also refer to a group of hosts or to a cloud of parasite infective stages.\nAlternate host sharing\u2014a life history strategy where two different species of parasites infect the same host, but not at the same time.\nAmbushing\u2014a manner of searching for hosts used by larvae and free-swimming adults, generally, resting still in the water column arched upwards at a 45\u00b0 body angle and then suddenly attacking an unaware host. Used in the daytime by some forms. Opossum attack is a form of ambushing. See cruising and hover and wait.\nAndrodioecy\u2014having dwarf males and larger hermaphrodites. The small male is usually attached on or near a larger hermaphrodite.\nAntennae\u2014the second pair of antennae, usually longer than the first.\nAntennulae\u2014the first pair of antennae, which are usually shorter than the second.\nBiological control\u2014an agent killing or sterilising unwanted organisms.\nBiphasic moult\u2014a moult occurring in two posterior (first) and anterior (second) parts.

The trophic nature of many crustacean symbiotic relationships remains uncertain.\nComplex life cycle (indirect life cycle)\u2014one with two or more hosts.\nComplex rebrooding\u2014a series of marsupial reproductions with vegetative instars between marsupial stages. When a female is reproductive, the marsupium contents occupy all the body space with a large number of offspring. Her other organs atrophy, and she does not feed. See vegetative stage and simple rebrooding.\nCopepodid\u2014the second larval stage in copepods, between naupliar stages and adult. The first copepodid is free swimming. The others are on the host. See recently encysted and later encysted.\nCruising\u2014a manner of searching for hosts used by larvae and free-swimming adults. Generally, it means swimming in the water column with an even keel.\nCryptogonochorism\u2014a degenerative male form, attached and parasitic on a female, fertilising her eggs.

However, there is some disagreement about what is outside. We consider the brood chamber, eye orbit, gill chamber, mouth, nares, and open sinus cavities as external as their surface is ectoderm. See endoparasite.\nEncapsulated\u2014see cyst and capsule.\nEncysted\u2014see cyst and capsule.\nEndoparasite\u2014completely within the host. It has no opening to the environment as in a mesoparasite. We consider closed sinus cavities, lacunar canals, rectum, intestine and urinary bladder internal.

See prey-predator life cycle and transfer host.\nPrey-predator transfer host (prey host)\u2014a resting host for some juvenile fish isopods (cymothoids) on which moults from the six-legged manca juvenile to a post-juvenile stages can occur.\nPrimary host\u2014see definitive host.\nProportional stunting\u2014parasites slowing the growth of their host in a way that cannot be discerned in length-weight condition factors.\nProtelean organisms\u2014have larvae that are parasites, usually endoparasites, and free-living adults.\nProtopleon larva\u2014the second larval series of jelly parasitoids (hyperiids) with a segmented metasome and imperfect pleopods. It metamorphosed from a pantochelis larva and gives rise to a juvenile.\nPseudoparasite\u2014our term for something that almost everyone accepts as, and calls, a parasite, but is not (e.g. most leeches).\nPullus II (plural pulli)\u2014see manca larva.\nPupa\u2014the unique, cigar-shaped, endoparasitic nauplii of larval parasitic copepods (monstrilloids).\nReproductive stage\u2014see vegetative stage.\nRecently encysted (copepodids 2\u20133)\u2014pandarid copepodid stage (Lewis 1964). See late encysted.\nResting host\u2014a host on which infective larvae or juveniles rest and feed. Larvae do not go through a metamorphosis on this host. See intermediate host, micro-male host, and transfer hosts.\nSea lice\u2014caligoid copepods that infect marine aquaculture fishes, especially salmon. Many recent authors have called them fish lice, which is incorrect. See lice.\nSecondary host\u2014a host less often infected than the preferred host or definitive host but on which the parasite may complete its life cycle.\nSemelparous\u2014females that have only one brood.\nSerial parasitoid\u2014similar to a parasitoid in brooding its young in a host, but may use and kill more than one host as a nursery, and also may feed on, and kill, multiple hosts, as an adult.\nSerial parasite\u2014an obligate parasite that largely depends on host, or hosts, for nutrition. It is not simply a minipredator, because it associates with a host longer than to feed and leave and has one or more life cycle stages that exist multiple times potentially on and off the same or different hosts. See temporary parasite.\nSimple life cycle\u2014see direct life cycle.\nSimple rebrooding\u2014new marsupial reproduction after a single moult. The internal organs are only flattened by a brood pouch with a moderate number of off spring. The female can feed as soon as she moults. See complex rebrooding.\nSite specific\u2014when a parasite almost always attaches in the same position on or in a host. See accidental attachment.\nSmaller predator\u2014not a great deal smaller than its prey, attaches to, feeds on, and kills the host. It is an, hitherto, unrecognised life cycle phase (minipredator phase) in parasitic crustacean life. See micropredator, minipredator, and Table 5.1.\nSpillover\u2014a term for the parasites, principally salmon sea lice, produced in fish farms, infecting native fishes. \u2018Spillover\u2019 suggests the pen is so full of free-swimming, infective parasites (copepodids) that a few are forced out. See filtering.\nSterilisation\u2014the act of making an animal unable to reproduce. See partial sterilisation, hormonal sterilisation, and nutritional sterilisation.\nStrict parasite\u2014see true parasite.\nSuperinfection\u2014a mass infection with about as many parasites that can fit on or in a host. This usually results in the death of the host and the parasites.\nSupra-females (post-adult stages, supra-adult)\u2014stages after the first adult female stage with size and/or morphological differences with the first adult and each other. These can be growth stages or instars and often occur in crustaceans.\nSupra-males\u2014see supra-females.\nTantulus larva\u2014the only larval stage of minute crustacean parasites (tantulocarids) with a dorsal head shield, six-segmented thorax, and biramous urosome.\nTemporary parasite\u2014(a) a facultative parasite; (b) a parasite that survives for a time after ingestion by a host species other than its customary host; (c) a minipredator, associated with a prey item just long enough for it to be called a host but largely free-living and rarely found associate with a host; or (d) a parasite with any free-living stage.\nThoracopod\u2014see pereopod.\nTransfer host (prey host)\u2014a resting host for some juvenile fish isopods (cymothoids) on which moults from the 6-leg manca juvenile to a post-juvenile stages can occur. This is not an intermediate host because no larval stages are involved. See paratenic host, micro-male host, and prey-predator life cycle.\nTransitional parasite\u2014a crustacean or roundworm (Nematoda) in the clade Ecdysozoa. They are relatively new parasites with many free-living relatives and little evolved towards a climax parasite state. See climax parasite.\nTransport host\u2014see paratenic host.\nTrichogon\u2014injected into a female by a male crypis, of parasitic barnacles (rhizocephalans), and becomes a dwarf male.\nTrophic transmission\u2014see parasite-induced trophic transmission.\nTrue parasite (good parasite, strict parasite)\u2014a small organism, which feeds from and harms a larger organism. True parasites have a definitive host, which they never leave.\nTrue predator (carnivore)\u2014an organism that hunts, kills and eats other organisms (prey). See ambushing, opossum attack, and Table 5.1.\nUnderdispersed (uniform, regular)\u2014see overdispersed.\nUpward incorporation\u2014adding a new host after the original host with the former definitive host becoming the intermediate host. Begins with parasites surviving in a predator of the original host. Moving higher on the food chain. See downward incorporation and parallel incorporation.\nUrosome\u2014abdomen of arthropods.\nVector mutualists\u2014when a disease or parasite transmitted to a host also benefits the vector. When crustacean parasites are vectors, the infective stage of the crustacean benefits by the invasive transferred organism confusing the immune system of the host and increasing infective crustacean survival. See viral crustacean mutalists.\nVegetative stage\u2014is a term we borrowed from botany to describe a feeding and nonreproductive female stage of fish isopods (cymothoids) between stages with a marsupium. See complex rebrooding.\nVermigon\u2014a migratory internal stage injected by the kentrogon stage of a parasitic barnacle (rhizocephalans).\nViral crustacean mutualists\u2014a virus benefiting its crustacean host and doing little or no harm to the host.\nVirgin female\u2014a term used in the literature for an adult female lacking a marsupium. A vegetative stage is a better term since these stages can occur both before and after stages with a marsupium.\nWhale lice\u2014see lice.\nY-cypris (plural: y-cyprii)\u2014see y-nauplius.\nY-nauplius (plural: y-nauplii)\u2014the first larval stage of y-parasites (facetotectans) and y-cypris the second.\nYpsigon\u2014a slug-like, unsegmented, and limbless form, which may be the infective stage for y-parasites (facetotectans).\nZoea stage (plural: zoeas or zoeae)\u2014the first larval stage of a decapod characterised by the use of the thoracic appendages for swimming and a large dorsal spine.\nZuphea\u2014the first juvenile of fish gnats (gnathiids) with obvious segmentation, which leaves the female, finds a host, feeds, and becomes the second stage, a praniza (P1).\n",
