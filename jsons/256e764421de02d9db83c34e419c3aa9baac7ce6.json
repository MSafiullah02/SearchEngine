The resuscitation team in the hospital used feedback from a smart defibrillator during arrests (control group). A new post event debriefing program was added to this -RAPID (Resuscitation with Actual Performance Integrated Debriefing). This consisted of a weekly 45 minute session reviewing cardiac arrest events. As well as an improvement in ROSC rate, there was also an improvement in CPR quality and interruptions to chest compression. The main weakness of this study is that the RAPID phase scanned the change in guidelines in 2005 -new guidelines had greater emphasis on CPR quality.",

Six to nine months later, subjects returned to manage the alternate scenario.

A significant improvement was seen between pre-and post-tests on the DSC in debriefed subjects (pre-test 66.8%, post-test 70.3%; F(1,57)=4.18, P=0.046).

(2005). \"Simulation-Based Training of Internal Medicine Residents in Advanced Cardiac Life Support Protocols: A Randomized Trial.\" Teach Learn Med 17(3): 202-208. Comment: LOE 5, Quality Fair, Supporting. This study shows that simulated emergencies followed by facilitated debriefings produced improvements in content knowledge and confidence when compared with clinical experience alone. Study does not specifically look at role of debriefings and cannot therefore look specifically at effect of debriefing -therefore LOE5, extrapolation. Wayne, D. B., A. Didwania, et al. (2008). \"Simulation-Based Education Improves Quality of Care During Cardiac Arrest Team Responses at an Academic Teaching Hospital: A Case-Control Study.\" Chest. 2008 Jan;133(1):56-61. Comment LOE5, fair. Supporting by extrapolation -training and debriefing in a simulator improves adherence to guidelines at real arrests. No randomization, looks at training and debriefing and not just debriefing. Therefore LOE5. Weng, T. I., C. H. Huang, et al. (2004). \"Improving the rate of return of spontaneous circulation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests with a formal, structured emergency resuscitation team.\" Resuscitation 60(2): 137-42. Comments LOE5, poor, supporting. Patient outcomes improved with improved team organization including debriefs and video feedback of real life resuscitations. The exact framework and whether this was a formal process is not discussed. The Utstein template is not used. The comparison is with historical group. This study is LOE 5 as does not specifically look at debriefing. Whitcomb, J., D. Brierton, et al. (1990). \"Code teams and the review of cardiac arrests.\" QRB Qual Rev Bull 16(4): 156-62.",
