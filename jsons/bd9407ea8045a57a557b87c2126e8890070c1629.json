Bangladesh, a densely populated nation, have conducted only 1759 tests in last one month with 9 reported deaths. The decisions of cluster-wise lockdown or social distancing, or even preparing the health system to respond to the pandemic are made without the availability of adequate data. This is fuelling panic in local community and giving an obscure picture in the global data.",

Therefore, the recent opening of the manufacturing industries, with subsequent closure due to criticism, contributed to migration to the overcrowded areas of the city [9] .
