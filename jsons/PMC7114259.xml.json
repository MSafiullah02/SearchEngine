            "text": "\nHouttuynia cordata, a flowering plant native to southeastern and northeastern Asian countries, is an herbal garnish in Vietnamese cuisine and southern China. The plant is also used in folk medicine in several countries. Water extracts from this plant have been reported to have inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Hayashi et al., 1995, Chiang et al., 2003) and the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Lau et al., 2008). Although those viruses belong to diverse families and may utilize different mechanisms for cell entry and infection, a common feature of infection by those viruses is to exploit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway for replication (Gregory et al., 2004, Amici et al., 2006, Kumar et al., 2008, Bielinska et al., 1989). The transcriptional regulator of NF-\u03baB family regulates host gene expression of cell survival, cell differentiation, inflammation as well as anti-viral responses. NF-\u03baB activity is also essential in preventing virus-induced apoptosis, a critical event for virus replication (Hiscott et al., 2001, Goodkin et al., 2003).",

            "text": "In this report, we attempted to address mechanisms associated with H. cordata antiviral activity using HSV-2 infection as a model system. HSV-1 and -2, also known as human herpes virus 1 and 2 (HHV1 and HHV2), are enveloped DNA viruses of herpes virus family that infect humans. After cell entry, HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection promotes persistent NF-\u03baB activation (Patel et al., 1998, Gregory et al., 2004, Yedowitz and Blaho, 2005) as well as MAPK activation (Hargett et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2010, Karaca et al., 2004), since the activity is required for cell survival and virus growth (Smith et al., 2000, Perkins et al., 2002). The importance of NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation in HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection has been demonstrated with pharmacological inhibitors and genetic approaches. IKK inhibition by cyclopentenone prostaglandin A blocks HSV-1 gene expression and reduces virus yield by more than 3000-fold (Amici et al., 2001). Inhibition of NF-\u03baB mediated gene expression by resveratrol blocks both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection (Faith et al., 2006), while curcumin a known inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activation also has potential activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections at relatively low concentrations (Kutluay et al., 2008). Zhang et al. (2010) recently demonstrated that inhibition or depletion of MEK1, an immediate upstream kinase of Erk1/2 MAPK, significantly blocks HSV replication.",

During the screening of herbal medicines against sexually transmitted diseases, we found that a hot water extract from H. cordata (HCWE) exhibited strong anti-HSV-2 activity. The IC50 for HSV-2 infection was estimated at approximately 50 \u03bcg/ml of lyophilized powder. Although HSV-2 infection has been reported to induce Erk MAPK and NF-\u03baB activation, we found HCWE blocked HSV-2 infection through selective inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. HCWE showed no effect on HSV-2 induced Erk MAPK activation. The HCWE mainly contains chlorogenic acid, flavonoids and the corresponding glycosides (Xu et al., 2006, Chiang et al., 2003). We found the flavonoids were responsible for the antiviral activity.",

Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection at a density of 5 \u00d7 104\n cells per well in complete medium. Culture supernatants collected from infection assays were series-diluted and used for titration of infectious virus. Plaque formation was assessed 48 h PI after fixation with 3% formaldehyde for 30 min followed by the addition of crystal violet. After rinsing off crystal violet with PBS, the number of plaques was counted manually. The infection was performed in triplicate samples.",

To semiquantitatively assess the effect, 10 \u03bcl culture supernatants were collected at 48 h PI for titration of virus release while cell viability was determined by an MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983).

            "text": "The transcriptional regulator NF-\u03baB plays a critical role in cell proliferation and viral gene expression of some viruses. NF-\u03baB activation also enables cells with anti-apoptotic activity, crucial for viral replication. Several medically important viral pathogens are known to require NF-\u03baB activity for replication and infection. Compounds that block NF-\u03baB activation have been reported to have antiviral activities. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) of the A and J type block TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation by direct inhibition and modification of the IKK\u03b2 subunit of IKK. Amici et al. (2001) reported that cyPG were also powerful inhibitors of IKK and NF-\u03baB activation induced by HSV-1 infection, an effect that was attributed to the potent antiviral activity in human cells. Curcumin, an inhibitor of constitutive NF-\u03baB activation (Shishodia et al., 2005), has been shown to inhibit herpes simplex virus immediate-early gene expression and virus replication at relatively low concentrations (Kutluay et al., 2008). Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound implicated with diverse biological activities, suppresses HSV induced activation of NF-\u03baB within the nucleus, resulting in impaired expression of HSV genes and synthesis of viral DNA (Faith et al., 2006). Those and our results suggest that reagents that target signaling pathways may exert selective activity against a diverse group of viral pathogens as previously suggested (Ludwig, 2009, Baba, 2006).",

The content of quercitrin can exceed 0.1% in dried leaves, while others are minor components (Xu et al., 2006). Kosuge (1952) first isolated houttuynin from H. cordata and reported its antibacterial activity. Hence houttuynin as well as the sodium houttuyfonate (bisulphite adduct as a prodrug due to its stability) had been used in China to treat bacterial infection and other complications until its withdrawal from the market due to lack of defined activity. We found that the once approved sodium houttuyfonate had no activity against HSV-2 infection or signaling pathway activation. Instead, we found that the antiviral activity was associated with the flavonoids, since quercetin, quercitrin and isoquercitrin all displayed significant activity against HSV-2 infection. This is consistent with the reported activity of some flavonoids on virus infection as well as inflammatory response (Kaul et al., 1985, Lyu et al., 2005, Choi et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2010).",
