Changes in the endothelial barrier function contribute significantly to the development of different pathological states including inflammation and impaired wound sealing. Moreover, they may contribute to the development of acute encephalopathies and organ dysfunctions (as a result of cardiovascular system involvement), organ fibrosis, increased angiogenesis, and oncogenesis (Di Pietro, 2016; You and Stallcup, 2017). Disruption of the endothelial barrier in the lungs (in particular, as a result of influenza virus or bacterial infection) may cause liquid to penetrate into alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Kwok et al., 2016). Impaired migration of endotheliocytes and changes in their proliferation and apoptotic activity, as well as altered cell permeability, are critical for the development of pathological states.",

A particularly important role in the stimulation of the signaling systems associated with endothelial cell migration is played by the vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) which interacts with ROS produced not only in the cytosol by Nox2 and Nox4, but also in mitochondria (Kim et al., 2017).",

Normal reproduction of influenza virus is impaired in nonpermissive cells, and the presence of virus is detected only at the level of the viral surface protein mRNA during no more than one or two passages (Danilenko et al., 2016). The change in the physiological state of the cells at the first passage (3\u20135 days) was the first stage in the changes induced in the cells by influenza virus, with further cell culturing (passages 3 to 8) resulting in the stably increased proliferation at low apoptosis levels (Smirnova et al., 2018).",

Cell migration grew slower by the 8th\u201312th hours and remained almost at the 12-h and control levels up to the 24th hours (Fig. 1a). The comparison of different sublines showed that highest migratory activity was exhibited by the endothelial cells after the contact with the minimum infective dose of influenza A virus (ECV-1ID subline, migratory activity 141% of the control activity 4 h after wounding). The migration exhibited by the cells infected with the high virus dose (ECV-1000ID) was the minimum (54% of the control 4 h after wounding). The cells after the contact with LPS (both in the case of individual exposure and together with the virus) showed slightly increased migratory activity during the first hours after wounding (4\u20138 h), while later migration remained at the control level (Fig. 1a).",

Rimantadine had almost no effect on the migration of the ECV-1ID subline cells (148% in 4 h), while the level of ECV-1000ID subline cell migration in the presence of this drug grew higher than the control level (up to 123% in 4 h).

The highest increase in cell migration was caused by both preparations in the sublines treated with LPS, namely, ECV-LPS (up to 238% in the case of rimantadine and 219% in the case of alpisarin), ECV-1ID + LPS (219 and 204%, respectively), and ECV-1000ID + LPS (197 and 175%, respectively).

The ability of the highly virulent avian influenza virus strains to cause a lethal disease in chicken as a result of apoptosis of the endothelial cells in different organs is well-known (Swayne, 2007). However, the pathological mechanisms of influenza infection, in particular, the link between the infection and apoptosis and barrier function impairment, are not always clear. It has been demonstrated in vitro that human influenza A viruses are able to trigger TNF-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells (Sumikoshi et al., 2008). At the same time, increased cell permeability in human microvascular endothelium (HMVEC) and association with apoptosis has been demonstrated only for live (infectious) influenza A virus; UV-inactivated avirulent influenza virus also caused an increase in cell permeability, but in this case not as a result of apoptosis, but rather as a result of the degradation of the TJ protein CLDN-5 (Armstrong et al., 2012). The role of the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 in both apoptosis induction and cell barrier function impairment is well-known, although these processes often develop independently of each other (Petrache et al., 2001; van Meeteren and ten Dijke, 2012).",

The results obtained in the present work, as well as in the previous one (Smirnova et al., 2018), show that all sublines of endothelial cells acquire resistance to apoptosis in the process of culturing (after the third passage), notwithstanding the high level of expression of mRNA for both TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2, especially in the ECV-1ID + LPS subline. This indicates a link between the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 and the increase in cell permeability, but not the induction of apoptosis in this case. This conclusion is supported also by the fact that, in the presence of the antivirals rimantadine and alpisarin, expression of TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 genes is inhibited and cell permeability is restored (due to the increase in the CLDR5 mRNA expression) with a simultaneous increase in the apoptosis level, which also indicates that these drugs are capable of restoring the functional state of the cells.",

TGF\u03b2 is considered to be the key cytokine participating in fibrosis. Reduced sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to Fas-induced apoptosis (resistance to apoptosis) with increased alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis level is a characteristic feature of pulmonary fibrosis, in which the regions of a disrupted epithelial cell layer with reduced reparation capacity are filled with apoptosis-resistant fibroblasts (Maher et al., 2010; Liu and Desai, 2015). Our findings (increased expression level for TGF\u03b2 mRNA along with the development of apoptosis resistance) provide support for the idea that there is a link between influenza virus infection and, especially, LPS treatment with myofibroblast formation and the possibility of pulmonary fibrosis development. Thus, the addition of LPS at the time of ECV-304 cell infection with influenza A virus leads to a more serious dysfunction of endothelial cells, in the same way as a secondary bacterial infection, even in the case of mild influenza infection leads to serious and, in many cases, complications that occur much later (McCullers, 2006).",
