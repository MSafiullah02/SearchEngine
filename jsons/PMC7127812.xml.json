            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the coronavirus of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus), is primarily known as a respiratory pathogen. The disease attributed to this virus was first recognized in 1941 in North Dakota, where outbreaks of severe respiratory infection occurred in flocks of young chickens (Fabricant, 1998). Some years later the infection reached layer flocks, causing a considerable decline in egg production (Fabricant, 1998). Kidney lesions due to IBV infection were reported in affected birds in the USA (Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962) and Australia (Cumming, 1963). Further clinical manifestations associated with IBV infection were then reported (Ambali and Jones, 1990, YuDong et al., 1998, Boltz et al., 2004, Landman et al., 2005, Villarreal et al., 2007). Different parts of the intestinal tract are suspected to be target tissues for the virus. IBV has also been suggested to play a role in the aetiology of proventriculitis (YuDong et al., 1998) and from time to time it has been isolated from birds with a range of other enteric signs (Ambali and Jones, 1990, Villarreal et al., 2007). Age-dependent adverse effects of IBV on the female reproductive tract have also been recognized (Broadfoot and Smith, 1954, Broadfoot et al., 1956), although the means by which the virus damages the oviduct of young birds has not yet been elucidated. Recent publications suggest that IBV may also have a role in male (Boltz et al., 2004, Boltz et al., 2006, Villarreal et al., 2007).",

The field cases reported until now suggest that the QX-like strains have wide tissue tropism and high pathogenicity, although the effect of individual isolates varies greatly. Therefore, a comprehensive experiment was performed to investigate the tissue distribution and tropism of QX-like strains originating from different countries and to compare them to each other and to the M41 and 793/B reference strains (Benyeda et al., 2009). The aim of the present study was to extend that investigation to the immunohistochemical examination of different organs in order to localize the viral antigen and determine its relationship to the observed tissue lesions.",

The characteristics and the chronological development of the lesions observed were in agreement with the findings of previous experiments (Purcell and McFerran, 1972, Nakamura et al., 1991, Owen et al., 1991, Chen et al., 1996, Kotani et al., 2000, Chousalkar et al., 2007). Despite the severity of the lesions in the trachea mucosa, expression of viral antigen was not high compared with other studies (Nakamura et al., 1991, Owen et al., 1991, Chen et al., 1996, Kotani et al., 2000). This might reflect the relatively late timing of collection of the first samples, since in previous studies antigen was first detected between 1\u20133 dpi and peaked at 3 dpi. The absence of viral antigen in the samples from birds infected with the Greek strain was not surprising, as the lesions induced in these chicks were mild. In the case of the Slovakian strain, the negative immunohistochemical findings might be explained by rapid clearance of the virus despite the presence of severe microscopical lesions.",

Several strains of the Mass serotype have been shown to produce kidney lesions in young (Butcher et al., 1990, Owen et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1996) and older birds (Jones, 1974). In our study the reference M41 strain of this serotype was used, but only mild histopathological lesions were recorded in the absence of virus antigen. Infection with the 793/B strain induced similar findings, while the nephropathogenic effect of the QX-like strains was greater and confirmed the high affinity of these strains (apart from the Greek strain) for the kidney. Viral antigen in the kidney peaked at 7 dpi and then became undetectable immunohistochemically. However, it is likely that a low concentration of virus persisted until the end of the experiment, associated with the observed chronic renal pathology.",

It would appear that the ovary remains intact and functional after infection and it is only the impairment of the oviduct that results in the \u2018false-layer syndrome\u2019 during the laying period. The pathogenesis of this syndrome has not been determined. Previous studies of the aetiology of cystic ovarian changes induced by infection with Mass and other serotypes of 1-day-old and older birds suggested the role of hormonal responses (Jones and Jordan, 1972) or the obliteration of the lumen due to the persistent epithelial damage (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972). In those studies, gross cyst formation developed from 20 dpi, while in the present experiment lesions were detected as early as 14 dpi in groups infected with the QX-like strains. Contrary to the findings of Crinion and Hofstad (1972), we did not observe microscopical lesions or viral antigen in the oviduct. The absence of lesions might be due to inappropriate sampling time or site of sampling.",
