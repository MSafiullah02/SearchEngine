No studies have examined how the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) loads in different organs with respect to time, post-mortem. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative temporal-spatial distribution of SARS-CoV in the post-mortem tissue samples of seven patients. Quantitation of a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was undertaken to standardize the amount of tissue tested. SARS-CoV viral load and SARS-CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio for each organ type were related to four time durations: onset of illness to death, death to post-mortem tissue sampling, and total durations of treatment with ribavirin and hydrocortisone. The SARS-CoV/ GAPDH RNA ratio remained relatively stable in most organ tissue types for all these time durations. The ratio reached the highest value of equal to or greater than one for lung and small bowel, whereas those for heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were always less than one. It is concluded that SARS-CoV viral loads in these organs remain relatively stable, post-mortem. This quantitative assessment further supports SARS-CoV has a specific tropism for the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which may be related to the density of SARS-CoV receptors.",

As a starting point, several studies determined the presence of SARS-CoV in different organs. Such studies examined post-mortem tissue directly to determine the pattern of SARS-CoV infection in humans. These studies focused necessarily on the more severe cases of SARS that lead to death, allowing post-mortem examination of lung tissue [Franks et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003; Chow et al., 2004; Mazzulli et al., 2004; Tse et al., 2004] , in both lungs and gut , the heart [Zhao et al., 2003; Farcas et al., 2005] , the kidney [Zhao et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2004; Farcas et al., 2005] , the liver [Chau et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2004; Farcas et al., 2005] , the spleen [Farcas et al., 2005] , and in tissue from multiple organs [Farcas et al., 2005] .

This is the soluble form of a novel homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE-2 Xiao et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004] . However, the presence of this receptor seems not to be the only determinant for organ tropism [Chan et al., 2004a] . Endothelial cells express high levels of ACE-2, but have not been found to be infected with SARS-CoV [Hamming et al., 2004; Lau and Peiris, 2005] , although systemic vasculitis has been reported in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal glands, and striated muscle interstitia [Ding et al., 2003] . Soon thereafter, a second SARS-CoV receptor or co-receptor candidate was found, and was shown to be a type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein, CD209L, a C-type lectin, also known as L-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and DC-SIGN2, which is expressed in type 2 alveolar and endothelial cells and has given further support for specific tissue tropisms for SARS-CoV. This glycoprotein has also been shown to bind other viruses, including Ebola, Sindbis and hepatitis C envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 [Jeffers et al., 2004] .",

Next, 600 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the tissue lysate, mixed by pipetting. The mixture was added to an RNeasy spin column and centrifuged for 15 sec at 13,000 rpm.

Each data point in each graph represents a different patient. Since each of these patients survived for a different duration after becoming infected with SARS-CoV, the graphs demonstrate the SARS-CoV RNA loads in these seven different patients, according to their duration of SARS illness. For Patients 2 and 3, SARS-CoV RNA was also detected in the psoas muscle tissue. Figures 1-6 show how the SARS-CoV loads changed in individual body organs in relation to the duration of SARS illness, that is, the interval between illness onset and time of death. To summarize, in the heart and liver there was a slight peak and plateau in the SARS-CoV/ GAPDH RNA ratio around 10-15 days after onset of illness. In the kidney, spleen, and small bowel, the ratio fluctuated around a relatively constant level. For the lung, the ratio fell noticeably from 2 log 10 to \u00c02 log 10 after 15 days of illness.",

In the organspecific viral load results, the overall picture made up from the data points from the seven different patients with different durations of SARS illness, generally, the SARS-CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio never reached above one in heart, kidney, liver, and spleen tissue for all x-axis parameters analyzed. For the lungs, the initial SARS-CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio was equal to or greater than one, than fell to less than one during the course of illness. For the small bowel, this ratio never fell below one. This ratio can be interpreted as the concentration of SARS-CoV infection in that organ, and may be a good indication of the degree of SARS-CoV tropism, which may in turn reflect the density of the SARS-CoV receptors and co-receptors present in that tissue type.",

The SARS-CoV RNA loads in most organs remained relatively stable, despite the samples being taken from different patients at different times after onset of illness. Only in the lung tissue was there a noticeable drop in SARS-CoV RNA load after 12-13 days post-onset of illness. The reason for this is unclear as the SARS-CoV RNA loads in the lungs during ribavirin and hydrocortisone treatment did not reflect this drop at this time. Generally, therefore, there seems to be no change in SARS-CoV RNA levels in these organs from week-to-week during clinical SARS illness. This is in contrast to positive rates or viral loads of SARS-CoV shed in body fluids secreted or excreted from some of these organs systems reported previously Cheng et al., 2004; Hung et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005] .

Except for the liver, all organ types exhibited a fairly similar SARS-CoV RNA load, despite being taken from seven different patients, between 90 and 180 hr, post-mortem. As there were no samples taken earlier than 90 hr post-mortem, one could argue that in most of the organs, any deterioration in SARS-CoV and GAPDH RNA levels may have already occurred and reached a nadir by 90 hr post-mortem. In the liver, this deterioration in RNA levels seems to continue after about 150 hr. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the similar antemortem levels of SARS-CoV and GAPDH RNA in the onset-death and ribavirin/hydrocortisone treatment data. Taken together, the data suggest that there is actually little fall in RNA levels in these organs, at least up to 180 hr, post-mortem. This implies that SARS-CoV RNA remains detectable in the body tissue of SARS patients for a long period after death, though infectious SARS-CoV was only cultured from the lung and bowel tissue (Table II) . The presence of viable SARS-CoV in the lung and bowel biopsies may be due to an overall viral load effect in that, in these tissues, the considerably higher viral load allowed some viable virus to remain, despite the majority of SARS-CoV possibly losing their viability after the patient's death.",

            "text": "There are limitations to this study. Firstly, the number of patients examined is small. Secondly, it is difficult to accurately quantify the amount of postmortem tissue taken as the input for the quantitative RNA assay. Although the tissue is described as approximately 3 mm 3 , as it is not a rigid body, this is necessarily an estimate. Nevertheless, by combining the results from the seven different patients into what may be thought of as a single 'composite' patient, the present study not only quantifies the SARS-CoV spatially within the body's major organs, but also temporally throughout the course of these patients' illness from fever onset to death and post-mortem examination. Mazzulli et al. [2004] analyzed post-mortem lung tissue using a real-time quantitative SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay, giving levels of 2.7 \u00c2 10 4 -3.8 \u00c2 10 9 SARS-CoV copies/g tissue. Farcas et al. [2005] used a similar methodology and reported SARS-CoV RNA levels for multiple organs. Table III shows an approximate comparison of the results of the current study and that of Farcas et al. [2005] . It can be seen that the maximum SARS-CoV RNA loads are within one order of magnitude in both studies for the lung, spleen, liver, heart, and kidney. The small bowel and muscle values differ by about two orders of magnitude, but as the number of samples in both studies are relatively low, there may be sampling bias effects (as the SARS-CoV RNA may not be uniformly distributed within an organ), so this difference may not be significant. Using the same comparison criteria, the median SARS-CoV RNA loads for the two studies are also similar for the spleen, heart and kidney, but show more variation for the lung, small bowel, liver, and muscle. Thus, despite these limitations, it can be seen from Table III that the results presented from this study are largely in line with those of Mazzulli et al. [2004] and Farcas et al. [2005] .",

It has been shown that the distribution of ACE-2 is mainly in the cardio-renal axis and the gastrointestinal system, particularly the ileum, duodenum, jejunum, caecum, and colon. Interestingly, the mRNA coding for ACE-2 has been found in up to 72 human tissues, many of which that do not actually express the enzyme itself [Harmer et al., 2002; Chiu et al., 2004] . The gene coding for ACE-2 is located on the X chromosome (Xp22) [Tipnis et al., 2000] , and since the 2003 SARS epidemics, there has been some speculation as to whether allelic variants of ACE-2 may have affected male and female SARS patients differently, though this has not been proven so far .",
