SARS mainly presents as pneumonia-like symptoms and the lungs are pathologically the most affected organs. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of organs from SARS patients who died revealed that the virus was found not only in the lungs and intestines, but also in the liver, distal convoluted renal tubules, sweat glands, parathyroid, pituitary glands, pancreas, adrenal gland, and cerebrum. The etiological agent for this disease is a novel member of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV) family with limited sequence homology to other coronaviruses [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Coronaviruses are enveloped, plus-stranded RNA viruses that lead to respiratory diseases such as the avian coronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV). SARS-CoV encodes 23 putative proteins including four typical structural proteins: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins [4], [7]. These four proteins contribute to generating the host's immune response, as has been observed in many other transmissible viruses, such as gastroenteritis coronavirus, bronchitis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, and mouse hepatitis virus. In addition to the structural proteins, replicase 1a ORF, replicase 1b ORF and eight novel ORFs have been identified.",

Viruses are known to utilize their own proteins to influence host cells. Apoptosis is a physiological mechanism to control cell numbers during development and to respond to foreign infections, including bacterial and viral infections [9]. Viruses have evolved strategies either to inhibit or stimulate host cell apoptosis, depending on particular virus\u2013host interactions. Many viruses encode either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BRLF-A and LMP-1 of the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, Crm of the poxvirus, p35 of the baculovirus, and E1A which can specifically inhibit or delay apoptotic pathways, resulting in increased virus production [10], [11]. Apoptosis in later stages of infection may also be advantageous in facilitating virus dissemination and limiting the host's inflammatory response. Apoptosis usually shows typical morphological changes such as cell blebbing nuclei condensation and DNA fragmentation and involves the activation of caspases, which cleave a variety of cellular substrates. Caspases are synthesized as precursors and activated upon induction by apoptotic signals. Mitochondria play a crucial role in the activation of caspases, leading to the activation of caspase-9 [12]. The Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in regulating cytochrome c releases, while pro-apoptotic members such as Bax, Bak, Bid and Bik promote cytochrome c release [13].",

            "text": "Apart from mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also plays an important role in apoptosis. Functions of the ER are affected by various intra-cellular and extra-cellular stimuli, so called ER stress, which includes inhibition of glycosylation, reduction of disulfide bonds, calcium depletion from the ER lumen, impairment of protein transport to the Golgi, and expression of mutated proteins in the ER. Under ER stress, unfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER, which eventually induces conflicting cellular activities; survival and apoptosis. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, cells activate a self-protective mechanism, termed the ER-stress response, to survive ER-stress conditions. The ER-stress responses of eukaryotic cells consist of three different mechanisms: translational attenuation to reduce accumulation of misfolded proteins [14], transcriptional activation of gene encoding ER-resident chaperones [15] and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) [16]. The ER-stress response is initiated by three types of ER membrane receptors, ATF6, IRE1 and PERK. If the adaptive responses are not sufficient to relieve cells from ER stress, cells undergo apoptosis to destroy the ER-stress-damaged cells.",

These data suggest that apoptosis may indeed play an important role in helping with virus dissemination in vivo, minimizing inflammatory reaction and evasion of the host's defense mechanisms. Importantly, pathological studies have revealed diffuse alveolar damage as the most notable feature in patients who died of SARS. It is reasonable to believe that apoptosis occurs in the alveolar epithelia cells in SARS patients. Three accessory proteins of SARS-CoV have been shown to induce apoptosis, ORF-3a (also known as U274, SARS X1, or ORF-3), ORF-3b (also known as ORF-4) and ORF-7a (also known as U122, SARS X4, or ORF-8) [18], [19]. ORF-3a protein is ER and Golgi apparatus localized protein. It has been shown to upregulate expression of all three subunits (A\u03b1, B\u03b2 and \u03b3) of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells and induce chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation [20], [21]. ORF-3b is predominantly localized in the nucleolus and partially in the mitochondria. ORF-3b also induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in transfected cells [22], [23]. ORF-7a is an ER-localized protein. It has been shown to have a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a typical ER retrieval motif at the C-terminus [24]. Moreover, overexpression of ORF-7a induces apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway [19]. However, the signaling pathway for ORF-3a, ORF-3b and ORF-7a induced apoptosis remains elusive.",

It has been shown to accelerate replication of a related mouse virus and interact with nonstructural protein (nsp8), which may be involved in virus replication [25], [26]. Recently, ORF-6 has been identified as an ER/Golgi membrane localized protein [27]. Here, we show that first; overexpression of ORF-6 induces apoptosis. Second, caspase-3 was activated in the present of ORF-6. Third, apoptosis induced by ORF-6 and ORF-7a was blocked by caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD, and JNK(c-Jun N-terminal kinase) inhibitor. Finally, ORF-6 and ORF-7a up-regulates ER chaperone protein, 94 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94), protein levels.

In the absence of z-DEVD, approximately 60% of cells underwent apoptosis when ORF-6 and ORF-7a were transiently transfected into the Vero E6 cells; however, when ORF-6 or ORF-7a were overexpressed in z-DEVD pre-treated cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased to approximately 20% (Fig. 2A). In parallel, Caspase-3 activities were also monitored when the Vero E6 cells were transfected with ORF-6. The activity of Caspase-3 can be detected by the amount of the 17 kD active form of Caspase-3 in cells by using Caspase-3 specific antibodies. Results in Fig. 2B showed that both ORF-6 and ORF-7a induced Caspase-3 activation, as the 17 kD active form of Caspase-3 was detected in both.

The nuclei of the cells were stained by Hoechst for 15 min. The number of healthy cells was counted under fluorescence microscopy with no DNA condensation and fragmentation. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by the number of healthy cells over the total number of transfected cells. Experiments were repeated three times and the standard deviations are shown. (B) Overexpression of ORF-6- and ORF-7a induces Caspase-3 activation. Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-ORF-6 and GFP-ORF-7a for 24 h. Cell lysates were normalized to 2 \u03bcg/ \u03bcl by lysis buffer and subjected to Western Blot with \u03b1-GFP, \u03b1-Caspase-3 and \u03b1-Actin. For positive controls, cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM of Staurosporine (STS) for 8 h. Cells without any treatment were served as negative control. (C) JNK inhibitor blocked ORF-6 induced apoptosis. Vero E6 cells were incubated with either Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) or 40 \u03bcM JNK inhibitor for 30 min before they were transiently transfected with 3 \u03bcg of GFP-Cb5, GFP-ORF-6 and GFP-ORF-7a for 24 h. Cell counts were done as mentioned in B.",
