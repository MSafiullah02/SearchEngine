While data on mortality rates according to the presence of different comorbidities are not available yet among U.S. patients infected with COVID-19, a report among 72,314 cases of COVID-19 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention notes an overall crude estimated mortality of 3-4%. This was significantly higher among those with CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), or hypertension (6.0%).(7) Similarly, another report of 1,099 patients from China early in the pandemic demonstrated that the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in severe vs. non-severe cases was 5.8 vs. 1.8%, respectively. (8) COVID-19 patients with poor outcomes, including intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or death, more commonly had underlying CAD than those with a more benign course (9.0 vs. 2.0%).",

(11) Importantly, the case fatality rate was higher in the Italian cohort than the Chinese cohort, reflecting not only an older age group, but possibly also increased prevalence of CVD, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as obesity. (12) There are important symptoms and consequences of COVID-19 infection related to the cardiovascular system. (13) Elevations in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin were reported in 10-20% of patients, and more than 10% of those who died from COVID-19 had substantial myocardial injury with either elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest during hospitalization, even in the absence of pre-existing CVD. (14, 15) In a study that included 138 patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China Guo et al. provide important insights into patients who manifest serum troponin elevations.(9) When comparing mortality rates for patients with and without troponin elevations, hospital mortality was 59.6% vs. 8.9%, respectively. Mortality for patients with established CVD but without troponin elevation was lower but still substantial at 37.5%. There were also linear correlations between serum troponin levels and high sensitivity C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, suggesting associations between myocardial injury, inflammation, and left ventricular stress.",

A meta-analysis of several Chinese studies found that diabetes was 2.3fold more common in those with COVID-19 infection and was associated with adverse outcomes.(18) A Chinese study including 174 consecutive patients infected with COVID-19 demonstrated that those with diabetes and no other comorbidities (n=24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, profound increases in inflammation, and hypercoagulability.

Despite efforts to improve our interaction with patients during this challenging time (detailed later in this document), potential limitations exist. For example, many patients may not be amenable or have appropriate technologic ability to participate in telehealth visits. Those seen virtually may be apprehensive to start new medications or titrate existing ones over a concern that side effects may warrant medical attention.

Rising rates of unemployment, loss of health insurance, and concern over the cost of copayments represent additional challenges to be overcome. One estimate suggests that an additional 7.3 million workers (plus their family members) will become uninsured due to loss of healthcare coverage as a result of unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic.(35) Sadly, underrepresented populations, patients living in rural communities, and those with poorer socioeconomic status are likely to be disproportionately affected. In fact, several recent reports have noted that the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting black individuals. As one example, more than 50% of COVID-19 infections and almost 70% of COVID-19 related deaths in Chicago have occurred in black individuals, a group that comprises just 30% of the city's population. (36) Acknowledging the critical issues currently faced by health care systems (e.g., ventilator shortages, limited personal protective equipment, unprecedented financial challenges), there also exists an ongoing need to address barriers to care delivery in the ambulatory setting. To this end, it is important to provide reassurance to patients that they should not hesitate to reach out to their providers with any questions or concerns. Cognizant of the fears they may have about COVID-19, we must help our patients understand that they should seek immediate medical attention for cardiovascular emergencies such as heart attack or strokes, and remind them of the relevant symptoms associated with these events. (37) Innovative solutions are urgently needed to address financial barriers that are likely to significantly limit optimal delivery of preventive care. Finally, it is important to brace for the next large wave of inpatient and ambulatory care that may be coming as a consequence of the disruption in the traditional care for patients with CVD ( Figure) .

Compounding this, there are concerns that supply chains may be threatened, including numerous pharmaceutical ingredients that rely on manufacturers in China. (39) Importantly, older individuals who are at highest risk of COVID-19 and associated morbidity are also the same group with greatest use of prescription medications. Early evidence suggests that while most are continuing to make regular trips to the pharmacy for medication refills, they are also increasing their risk of potential exposure and hampering efforts at social distancing.

There are currently 23 million Americans with coronary heart disease, heart failure or stroke, and 118 million with hypertension.(1) Further, there are over 72 million office visits per year with CVD issues as the primary diagnosis.(2) Disruption in access to care and preventive interventions for these higher risk individuals and delay or deferral of these visits can have significant consequences. Further, the alterations to lifestyle habits with social distancing, as well as the cumulative consequences of increased societal stress and anxiety from fear of COVID-19 infection may adversely affect those with CVD. Deaths from COVID-19 in the United States are anticipated to be ~60,000.(3) By context, approximately 900,000 individuals succumb to CVD in the U.S. annually, and this number could increase due to disruptions in care caused by COVID-19.(1)",

Heart failure (reduced left ventricular contractility) is likely a manifestation of: (1) respiratory impairment with hypoxia; (2) inflammatory storm induced by a massive elevation in interleukins and cytokines; (3) myocarditis induced by direct viral infection of myocardium; and (4) acute hemodynamic decompensation stemming from severe systemic infection.(13)",

In the case of COVID-19, ACE2 doubles as a virus binding receptor and promotes its cellular internalization. ACE2 expression is increased in the setting of diabetes and myocardial infarction, both of which are associated with a poorer prognosis in those with COVID-19 infection.(26) Given the fact that many patients with hypertension, diabetes, or CVD take angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which upregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), some have speculated that the use of these medications may facilitate infection with COVID-19.(27) However, there are also data suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs may be beneficial in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome, possibly because of their promotion of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.(24) It is worth noting that only ~25%% of Chinese adults are hypertensive,(28) with only 25-30% of those taking ACEs/ARBs, resulting in a small proportion of COVID-19 infected in China on these medications.(29) Given the fact that there are no clinical trial data demonstrating the adverse impact (or lack thereof) of such therapies in COVID-19, all major societal statements thus far recommend continuation of these therapies in patients with COVID-19.",

Many home activities are sedentary and screen time is likely increasing, as adults and children increase the use of computers and smart devices in efforts to stay connected with the outside world and pass the time. Nutrition There are notable challenges to maintaining healthy nutrition in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased perceived stress can trigger unhealthy eating patterns such as over-eating, emotional eating, and making unhealthy food choices such as diets with higher intake of saturated fats, simple refined carbohydrates, and sugar-sweetened beverages.(53-55) Since social distancing recommendations advise that trips to grocery stores be limited, there inevitably is decreased access to healthier food items like vegetables, fruits, low fat dairy, and other perishable products. Often foods with longer shelf life are highly processed. In fact, there are early reports of increased alcohol consumption(56) as well as purchase of comfort foods such as soups and snacks(57) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tobacco cessation Cigarette smoking still remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, as highlighted by the recent Surgeon General's report on smoking cessation, despite a significant decline in smoking prevalence over the past decades.(58,59) Overcoming nicotine addiction is challenging even in normal times, and negative psychological factors (perceived stress, anxiety, frustration) are smoking triggers.(60) This current anxiety-provoking crisis may create triggers for smoking relapse and continued smoking behaviors, but there are also opportunities to make strides in tobacco cessation.",

Previously, Medicare part B reimbursed telehealth visits only for individuals that lived in a rural community with certain geographic restrictions. This restriction was recently removed on a temporary and emergency basis under the 1135 waiver authority and Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act.(65) Patient copays and reimbursement for telehealth still vary by state and by payer, though providers can waive copays for patients with Original Medicare. Reimbursement for Medicaid varies by state, though many states have expanded telehealth coverage. Billing Medicare allows billing for various types of telehealth services. Virtual check-ins[5-10 minutes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code G2012] are the lowest intensity and used to determine if an in-person visit is necessary. This category also includes remote evaluation of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient (HCPCS code G2010) (Table 2). E-visits are patient-initiated communications through online portals for established patients only. Their reimbursement is purely based on time, and can be conducted with audio only. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for these \"Online Digital Evaluation and Management\" encounters (another name for E-visit) include 99421 (5-10 minutes), 99422 (11-20 minutes), 99423 (21+ minutes), and reimburse between $13 and $50 per visit.(66) Official telehealth services recognized by CMS require the use of both audio and video, which use traditional office outpatient CPT codes (e.g. 99201-99215), and reimburse at the same rate as in-person visits. Previously, CMS allowed telehealth only for established patients. However, new temporary PHE rules changes allow the use of telemedicine for new patients as well.(65) Prior rules required physicians to be in a health care facility to conduct these visits; this requirement has been removed and CMS has also now updated guidance regarding the Place of Service (POS) modifier which determines additional reimbursement. Previously, telehealth visits used the POS code of 02, signifying they were occurring via telemedicine. Now, providers should use the POS code that corresponds to where the visit would have taken place had it been inperson (i.e., 11, representing in office). Importantly, providers should appropriately document key aspects of these visits, including time spent, patient consent for virtual visit, and confirmation of patient identification (e.g. two identifiers-typically name and date of birth). The level of billing is determined based on medical decision making or on time associated with the encounter. Finally, the telephone only telehealth visit was recently changed as part of the COVID-19 PHE. These are telephone only evaluation and management services that were previously deemed by Medicare as noncovered services. They include CPT 99441 (5-10 minute), 99442 (11-20 minutes), 99443 (21-30 minutes) for physicians and 98966-98968 for advanced practice providers and other non-physician professionals. Under the PHE, these services will now be reimbursed with work RVU valuation of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.70, respectively. Specific telehealth coverage, documentation and coding, and payment level for telehealth services may vary by private insurer. Some, but not all, states have passed executive orders directing private health plans to cover telehealth at rates similar to inperson visits. A listing of state laws related to the COVID-19 PHE can be found here: https://www.cchpca.org/resources/covid-19-related-state-actions. Technology Most telehealth vendors have the ability to integrate with the majority of the largest electronic health record (EHR) companies. The American Academy of Family Physicians has maintained a telehealth toolkit, which includes information on various telehealth vendors.(67) However, for many providers, converting in-person to telehealth visits that are conducted via phone only requires relatively little new technology. Visit documentation and billing can be done through their existing EHR. At the simplest levels, providers can call patients using an audio-only connection. There are several non-HIPAA compliant video technologies (e.g., Facetime, WhatsApp) that can be used for patient visits during the PHE. Many vendors including Skype, Zoom, and Google, to name a few, offer HIPAA compliant product communication versions.(64)Remote monitoringRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a division of telehealth defined as \"a digital health solution that captures and records patient physiologic data outside of a traditional health care environment.\"(68) A variety of wired or wireless devices enable collection and remote transmission of clinically relevant data to guide management plans.(69)",

            "text": "The success of RPM hinges on patient engagement with technology. Ideal solutions employ user-centered design and go beyond passive monitoring to empower the patient as an active participant in her or his care. Success of RPM also depends on the accuracy of measurements. When measuring blood pressure, for example, an upper arm cuff is preferred over finger or wrist monitors. In general, app-based cuffless approaches are not recommended.(70) Clinicians can promote measurement accuracy by confirming that patients are using a Food and Drug Administration approved device and by providing education on measurement technique.(71) Enhancing Medication Access and Adherence Several practical strategies can be implemented to improve patient access and adherence during the pandemic. Currently, only around 10% of U.S. retail prescriptions are completed through mail order, a number that must be vastly increased.(39) Some local pharmacies perform home delivery which is recommended for older and high risk individuals. In addition, various pharmacy chains are allowing earlier refill options, prior to completion of 30 days since the previous refill. Some states, such as Georgia, have authorized pharmacists to refill prescription drugs, excluding controlled substances, if the prescribing provider cannot be reached.(72) All providers should proactively review with patients the need for extended refills at every contact, inquire about new challenges and barriers for accessing medications, and discuss strategies to obtain medications while minimizing exposures during this health emergency. The full care team should be involved in enhancing medication access and adherence including office staff that can query about refills during scheduling calls and other patient contacts, as well as pharmacists and advanced practice clinicians who can provide telehealth visits to address side effects, barriers, alternatives, and titrations. Any rigid practice rules regarding provision of refills should be liberalized. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration is carefully monitoring for prescription medication supply chain disruptions.(73) Federal and state authoritiesshould prioritize ensuring availability of agents deemed \"essential medicines\", following the paradigm of the World Health Organization for agents that satisfy priority health care needs of a population, including cardiovascular drugs. While certain higher tier medications may not be considered essential medicines from a population perspective, they can serve a critical role for individuals at highest cardiovascular risk. Barriers to appropriate acquisition of these medications should be lowered, including cumbersome prior authorization processes during this emergency.",

This model of leveraging the entire cardiovascular team has been shown to be effective. For example, in a systematic review of clinical trials involving nurses or pharmacists for longitudinal management of hypertension, the odds ratios (95% CI) for blood pressure control were 1.69 (1.48-1.93) for nurses, 2.17 (1.75-2.68) for pharmacists within primary care, and 2.89 (1.83-4.55) for community pharmacists.(75) Similar results were demonstrated in patients with diabetes.(76) The beneficial effects of a collaborative care delivery model for control of cardiovascular risk factors has also been borne out in studies involving large numbers of cardiology practices(77) as well as studies conducted at the level of health care systems.(78) Importantly, these advantages were not associated with an increase in health resource utilization.(79) In the era of COVID-19, there is a mandate to expand telehealth services. To this end, we therefore recommended enhancing and facilitating the roles of all members of the cardiovascular care team to improve delivery of guideline directed cardiovascular care and adherence to lifestyle related recommendations and medications. Some examples include management of chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia by advanced practice clinicians using virtual visits; medication reconciliation and counseling on medication adherence by clinical pharmacists using virtual visits; and virtual consultation by dietitians providing practical lifestyle counselling on heart healthy nutrition choices and physical activity recommendations while practicing social distancing.",

COVID-19 has made abundantly clear to all health care stakeholders (payers, patients, providers, etc.) the critical role and effectiveness of telehealth. Without better reimbursement for HBCR (on par with facility-based CR), some HBCR programs are being forced to leverage CPT codes (99454 and 99457) that are used for remote physiological monitoring (in which a provider has to spend 20 minutes or more reviewing and acting on the data). However, this is not a true solution to the HBCR reimbursement issue and professional societies need to lobby for appropriate reimbursement of HBCR services, including at least temporary CMS coverage for CR telehealth services.
