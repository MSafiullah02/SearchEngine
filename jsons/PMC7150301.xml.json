IgM, IgG, and IgA are the principal classes of immunoglobulins with relevance to this chapter and will be discussed in more detail. Those individuals unfortunate to have allergies have problems due to IgE against allergens (such as ragweed, peanut, or cat dander). In this case the IgE molecules sit on the surface of cells that can release histamine when the offending allergen bridges two such molecules. In an infection, immunoglobulins usually appear in the order of IgM, IgG, and IgA. B cells first begin to produce IgM, and then some B cells undergo an irreversible switch to those that produce IgG. Later some of this population of cells undergo a switch to become IgA-secreting type B cells. Immunoglobulins persist for varying times; for example, the half-life of particular IgM antibodies is 5 days, while that of IgG can be as long as 21\u201323 days (Table 14.1\n).4,\n6\n",

The vaccine can be composed of a live or attenuated microbe, a whole non-proliferating microbe, or an antigenic part of the microbe. Regardless, the intent of the vaccine is to produce protection, often by protective antibodies. Although the half-life of an individual IgG molecule is less than a month, a population of antibodies in the IgG isotype form may persist for life. Memory B cells can sustain these antibodies and retain the ability to quickly generate the appropriate antibodies when challenged. When the immune system encounters another infection or is subjected to a revaccination (booster), the result is an accelerated production of the particular antibody and increase in the levels that circulate in the blood.

That response may involve IgM at the early stage and IgG later. Late in the disease or during recovery, only IgG to particular antigens may be seen. A classic example is the human antibody response to Epstein Barr virus (EBV).7 EBV is the virus known to cause mononucleosis. During acute early disease, it is common to find high levels of antibody of the IgM isotype to the viral early antigen (EA) and viral capsid antigen (VCA). It is rare to find IgG antibody to the VCA or Epstein Barr Nuclear Acid (EBNA) in anything but low titers. As the patient recovers from their first infection with EBV, it is rare to find anything but low levels of IgM to EA or VCA, but IgG to VCA in higher or increasing levels is common. Antibodies to EBNA are often very low during this stage. Then after clinical recovery, that is, several months later, IgM to EA and VCA stay at low levels whereas IgG to VCA and EBNA remain at high levels, often for years. Table 14.3\nillustrates this pattern by stage of the immune response to EBV and its particular antigens. Figure 14.3\nis a graphic display of this. For the clinician or epidemiologist this provides a framework to determine where in the infectious process a patient may be. Tables 14.2\nand 14.3 and Figures 14.2 and 14.3 illustrate how responses to a biothreat agent or its toxin may be used to give some chronological indication of exposure. Combining the antibody response with detection of particular antigens can provide further definition as to the stage of infection or exposure.",

The controlled experiment may be in a laboratory animal or a patient receiving a booster vaccine. The uncontrolled but normal clinical event occurs when the patient is exposed again to the infectious agent for whatever reason. Consider a generic antigen exposure. The first time the immune system sees Antigen X (AgX) it responds as shown in Figures 14.1 and 14.2. At first any antibody to AgX is barely discernible; then the levels rise and later fall to a plateau. If a mixed infectious exposure were to occur with AgX and a new AgY from another microbe, the immune system would quickly mount a brisk and high level of Ab to AgX, while the course of Ab to AgY would be slow and delayed, just as was the first exposure to AgX. For AgX this is a phenomenon termed immunological memory or an amnestic response. This can be useful when the symptoms and signs of exposure to either X or Y are similar. This is the case with the early flu-like symptoms of pulmonary anthrax and the influenza virus itself.",

Three years later, the same individual exposed to a partially similar influenza virus responds preferentially to those antigens that were also present on the original influenza virus. The person also makes a smaller initial antibody response to new antigens, that is, those not shared with the first virus. The initial response is minimal in comparison. Ten or 20 years later, during a new flu season and exposure to a third strain of influenza, the most brisk responses would be to antigens previously recognized by the immune system. This is the scientific basis for giving the flu vaccine, which contains a variety of possible antigens common to multiple strains of the flu virus so that a rapid and protective antibody response will occur.",

This information may have critical probative value or it can guide investigative leads. The absence of a specific antibody response may also have equal value in a particular investigation. Certainly its importance is increased in the context of knowledge of what organism may be involved, when the exposure was likely to have occurred, the route of exposure, what symptoms and signs are manifesting in the host, and other hard data points such as detection of antigens themselves, and detection of microbial DNA or RNA.8 Other information such as how many hosts (people or animals) have had this infection in the geographic region, what is the normal infection rate, and background incidence of antibody titer due to the organism in question or a related organism, is also important.",

He was the newspaper mailroom clerk who delivered mail to the first patient (case 1). On September 28, he developed a nonproductive cough, intermittent fever, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. These symptoms worsened through October 1 when he was hospitalized. In addition he had shortness of breath with exertion, sweats, mild abdominal pain and vomiting, and episodes of confusion. Temperature was elevated to 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), heart rate was rapid at 109/min, respiratory rate was slightly fast at 20/min, and blood pressure was 108/61 mmHg. He had bilateral conjunctival injection and bilateral pulmonary rhonchi. At that time his neurologic exam was normal. No skin lesions were observed. The only laboratory abnormalities were low albumin, elevated liver transaminases, borderline low serum sodium, increased creatinine, and low oxygen content in the blood. Blood cultures were negative on hospital day 2, after antibiotics had been started. The chest X-ray showed a left-sided pneumonia and a small left pleural effusion but no \u201cclassical\u201d mediastinal widening. The patient was initially given intravenous azithromycin; cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were subsequently added. A nasal swab obtained on October 5 grew Bacillus anthracis on culture. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral effusions and multilobar pulmonary consolidation but still no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pleural fluid aspiration was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Bacterial cultures of bronchial washings and pleural fluid were negative. A transbronchial biopsy showed B. anthracis capsule and cell-wall antigens by immunohistochemical staining. During hospitalization, the white blood count rose to 26,800/mm,3 and fluid from a second thoracentesis was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Both pleural fluid cells and pleural biopsy tissue showed B. anthracis capsule and cell-wall antigens by immunohistochemical staining. Serial serum samples demonstrated a greater than fourfold rise in serum IgG antibody to the PA component of the anthrax toxins by an ELISA assay. The patient was able to leave the hospital on October 23 on oral ciprofloxacin. Table 14.5\nillustrates both the clinical and bioforensic approach and context in which to analyze such a patient.

Beginning on October 29, 2001, 1,657 employees and others who had been to the Washington, D.C. postal facility went to the D.C. General Hospital for antibiotics additional to those begun on October 21. Serum samples were obtained from 202 individuals, and all were negative for specific IgG antibody to the PA IgG, including the three participants who reported a remote history of anthrax vaccination. Limitations to this data are the fact that antibiotics were begun before serum testing, and there were no baseline serum samples available for testing. Also, the time period from exposure to sampling was very short. Among 28 individuals with positive nasal swabs in the Capitol exposures who received antibiotics immediately, none had a positive culture from a nasal swab repeated 7 days later, and none had positive serum IgG to PA antigen 42 days after exposure. This again emphasizes the limitation and interpretation of a test in someone who had early antibiotic treatment. It does raise forensic considerations. Even with this easily disseminated strain, an antibody response may be aborted or modified with antibiotics by early eradication. Furthermore, antibiotics taken prior to exposure would likely be effective in preventing laboratory and clinical signs of an infection or exposure. Detection of DNA, antigen, or the organism itself on a person's body, clothing, or possessions would raise a red flag.",

            "text": "Melioidosis is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei.\n16 It is also an example in which key clinical signs and laboratory features raise the possibility of this infection. Related studies and observations are presented here to illustrate some of the temporal issues of the host response and the need to interpret results of an assay in the appropriate clinical and geographic setting. Whether it is an acute infection, persisting one, or past infection can be determined by looking at several host responses. Often a simple indicator of infection such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) can create clinical suspicion to begin a probe for a specific infection. In a study of 46 patients with clinical melioidosis, 35 (22 culture-positive and 13 culture-negative) had relatively uneventful disease courses. Initially they had elevated serum CRP that decreased with antibiotic therapy and returned to normal as their disease resolved. In another series of patients, IgM and IgG were measured by ELISA in 95 sera from 66 septicemic cases and 47 sera from 20 cases with localized melioidosis.17 Sixty-five sera from culture-negative cases seronegative for other endemic infections but suspected of melioidosis were also examined. Other controls included 260 non-melioidosis cases, 169 high-exposure-risk cases, and 48 healthy individuals. The IgG-ELISA was 96% sensitive and 94% specific. All sera from cases with septicemic and localized infections and 61 of 63 sera from clinically suspected melioidosis cases were positive for IgG antibody. The sensitivity and specificity of IgM ELISA were 74% and 99%, respectively. A geometric index for IgM antibody in the sera of the melioidosis cases was significantly higher in melioidosis cases compared to that of the non-melioidosis disease controls. Another study by some of the same authors using a rapid test also showed IgG and IgM to have clinical utility.18 Another study with the intent of evaluating the utility of an IgG assay compared to other assays illustrates how the clinical and temporal context must be integrated for interpretation.19 It also illustrates how there is room for improvement in tests and that the best analysis will result from an understanding of the conditions in the endemic area and utilization of samples and controls from that area. These tests were evaluated in the actual clinical setting in an area endemic for melioidosis. Specificity of specific IgG (82.5%) and specific IgM (81.8%) were significantly better than that of an indirect hemagglutination test (74.7%). The sensitivity of the specific IgG assay (85.7%) was higher than that of the IHA test (71.0%) and the specific IgM test (63.5%). Specific IgG was found in septicemic cases (87.8%) and localized forms (82.6%). The specific IgG test was also better than the specific IgM test and the IHA test in identifying acute melioidosis cases in the first five days after admission. IgG antibody to a B. pseudomallei antigen remained high for longer than 5 years in recovered disease-free patients. Because this is a disease that may have an incubation of days to years, an acute case may very well be picked up by IgM versus IgG if it were a matter of days from infection. Although endemic for Southeast Asia, if it were used as a biothreat agent in a different environment, its etiology may not be recognized immediately. The importance of understanding endemic area factors as well as the host to the microbe is further illustrated in another zoonotic example. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) can be transmitted via aerosols. One study with the intent at looking for improved tests did show the utility of IgM to determine an early exposure to RVFV.20 Two ELISA IgM tests detected specific IgM antibodies to RVFV during the first 6 weeks after vaccination. Three inactivated vaccine doses were given on days 0, 6 to 8, and 32 to 34. ELISA serum IgM on days 6 to 8 were negative or in the lower range of significance; on days 32 to 34 they were strongly positive; on days 42 to 52 they were waning and later were negative. The plaque reduction neutralization test was negative on days 6 to 8 and became positive in later samples. Similar to the examples shown above, their data suggest that three doses of RVFV vaccine induced a prolonged primary antibody response. The authors of that study concluded that the ELISA IgM could become an important tool for early diagnosis in acute human infection. Good correlation of a neutralization test and ELISA IgG would indicate a later infection.",

This is often considered by understanding the elements of positive and negative predictive values of an assay within a population being tested. On one extreme is the situation that occurred with the onset of human immune deficiency (HIV) in the U.S. First there were no cases, and therefore a precise highly sensitive and specific test with excellent positive and negative predictive values (such as exists now when a combination of tests are used) would not likely yield a positive result in an area where there was little disease at the onset, Kansas, for example. A positive test by today's methodologies from a 1970 serum sample from Kansas would be considered a probable false-positive and warrant further investigation. However the same sample tested at the beginning of HIV testing could have been positive if the person had adult T-cell leukemia, which is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). This is because the original tests for what became known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) involved whole viral lysates in which up to 30% of the HTLV-1 sera cross-reacted. Suspicion to the contrary would be raised by knowledge of different presentations of the infection. For example, HTLV-1 can actually be used in the laboratory to immortalize cells. In the patient it actually increases the T-cell count, as is the nature with leukemia, instead of decreasing them, as with HIV infections.

The elderly lady who died in Connecticut from anthrax clearly had no occupational exposure nor was she known to have had contact with anyone who had anthrax. It was possible that she received contaminated mail. However if this case had occurred as the index case or out of context of the mail attacks, it would have been reasonable to question her travel history, what her work if any was, or if she received or used products from an endemic area for anthrax. Similarly the Vietnamese woman who died in New York City would also have had these questions investigated. It would have been useful to search for direct or indirect evidence of anthrax by physical examinations of her contacts or close neighbors. Inspection and cultures from her workplace, apartment, and apartment complex (especially contiguous neighbors) are important for presence of anthrax. Coworkers, friends, neighbors, and other contacts could have had blood samples analyzed for antibody to anthrax antigens. These samples could have been frozen so that if one were positive it would be available for a comparison study in the future. At a minimum these types of studies could serve as future control data for the geographic region. Although hypothetical, several results could have occurred, and each will be analyzed separately: First example: a close contact is positive for IgM to one of the B. anthracis antigens, e.g. PA. This would suggest that this person had recent exposure and if nothing else should be treated. This individual could conceivably be the one who knowingly or unknowingly passed the spores to the patient. Given the October 26 onset of illness, which is late in the mailing sequence, it would be less likely that this individual was a perpetrator but rather a recent victim too. However if this person were IgG-positive on the assay, then there are several other possibilities. Perhaps this person had past exposure in an endemic region with a subclinical or treated illness (e.g., Haiti, where anthrax is known as \u201ccharcoal disease\u201d). Or this person could have been vaccinated for bona fide reasons such as a researcher who received it for occupational protection. Or this person could have obtained the vaccine originally for legitimate or illegal purposes but was nevertheless vaccinated. Animal vaccines may be more obtainable without strict record keeping. This person could have loaded the mail with relative impunity if there were protective antibody generated from the vaccine. These situations require intelligence information regarding access, ability, and motive. However the IgG finding could point investigators towards such an individual, whereas an IgM finding justifies critical therapy. Coming from the other direction, where information points to a particular individual, investigation could be extended to ingestion of antibiotics. Questions would be raised regarding access to antibiotics, recent ingestion of them, half-life of the antibiotic, half-life of the metabolites of the antibiotics, and in which body fluids or tissues the residual can be found. As illustrated from the data in the earlier sections, someone with antibiotics in their system could be protected from exposure to a sensitive microbe. This person would be antibody-negative and likely antigen- and microbial DNA/RNA-negative, since the infection would have been eradicated before the organism could proliferate in any significant quantity.",
