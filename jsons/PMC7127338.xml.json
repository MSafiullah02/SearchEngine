            "text": "Glycosyl-1-phosphates are important compounds in many life processes. They are essential constituents of larger biomolecules and are key intermediates in the metabolism of sugars and their transformation into nucleosides. Among them, 2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-ribose-1-phosphate is a catabolic product of thymidine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.4), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of pyrimidine nucleosides and which may promote angiogenesis.1 Thymidine phosphorylase is also involved in the degradation of antiviral agents such as BVDU.2 It is recognized that the therapeutic potential of drugs bearing a phosphate, phosphinate or phosphonate moiety is considerably reduced due to their low membrane permeation because each of these groups carry negative charges at physiological pH.3 Several prodrug technologies have been investigated to overcome this problem4 and, among them, the phosphoramidate ProTide technology has been successfully applied to various nucleoside analogues.5 Furthermore the phosphoramidate technology has been recently applied to sugars (mainly glucosamine)6 in order to improve their therapeutic potential. The synthesis of phosphoroamidate prodrugs of 2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-ribose-l-phosphate is of great interest, as they could act as inhibitors of thymidine phosphorylase or regulators in associated metabolic processes.7\n",

            "text": "Many papers have reviewed the introduction of a phosphate group at the anomeric position of a glycosyl unit.8 Three main strategies are observed: (a) the sugar, activated at the anomeric position, acts as an electrophilic compound and a nucleophilic displacement reaction is performed thanks to a phosphate anion. In this case, the electrophilic compounds are generally glycosyl halides,9 glycosyl-trichloroacetimidates,10 glycosyl nitrates,11 or glycosyl thioimidoyl derivatives;12 (b) the anomeric hydroxyl group of the sugar acts as the nucleophilic component and attacks an activating phosphate or phosphite in the presence of a base; (c) another alternative strategy consists in synthesising P(III) intermediates: the most famous approaches are the phosphoramidite methodology followed by oxidation of the intermediate phosphite;13 or the H-phosphonate approach which entails phosphitylation of the hydroxylic sugar followed by oxydation of the resulting H-phosphonate.14 However, these strategies are mainly applied to glycosyls in their pyranose form. In the case of the furanosyl family, the phosphorylation step has been successfully applied in the case of the ribo or arabinofuranosyl analogues,15 but it is hardly described in the case of 2-deoxyribose derivatives: due to the absence of a 2-hydroxyl group, the anomeric phosphate is more labile, so its synthesis is quite difficult. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, only one strategy concerning the phosphorylation step at the anomeric position of 2-deoxyribose was described:16 under acidic conditions and with an excess of phosphoric acid, 2-deoxyribose-1-chloride 1 was phosphorylated in good yield to give compound 2 (Scheme 1\n).",

The next step was the coupling of compound 4 with different suitable phosphorochloridates in order to obtain the desired phosphoramidates. We tried this reaction under different conditions (\u221278 \u00b0C or rt) and with different bases (DMAP, NMI, tBuMgCl) but unfortunately this coupling reaction did not work.",

The phosphorylation step was first tried in classical conditions using POCl3, phenyldichlorophosphate19 or chlorodiphenyl phosphate20 in the presence of different bases and activating agents such as PyBOP.21 We also investigated the P(III) strategy: we tried to use the phosphoramidite,22 phosphoradiamidite23 and H-phosphonate24 methodologies. We decided to try the phosphorylation with charged phosphorylating agents such as methyl pyridinium dichlorophosphate25 or of the dibarium salt of 2-cyanoethylphosphate26 in order to stabilize the resulting phosphate. To finish our study, we decided to invert our strategy by placing the leaving group on the anomeric position of the sugar(a), (b), 27 and to use the phosphate reagent as the attacking agent. But all these attempts did not lead to the desired products, which lead to the conclusion that final compounds are not stable under the reaction conditions.",

            "text": "At this stage, we concluded that the problem in all these phosphorylation reactions came from the 2-deoxyribose sugar: the lack of a group at the 2 position destabilizes the resulting phosphate. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the phosphorylation reaction was described several times on ribose and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyribose derivatives in the literature.15 Considering this information and the fact that the fluorine atom is a good isostere of the hydrogen atom, we decided to synthesize prodrugs of 2-fluoro-2-deoxyarabinose-1-phosphate. The synthesis started from commercially 1,3,5-tri-benzoyl-2-fluoro-2-deoxyribose 6 (Scheme 3\n): bromination of the anomeric position28 followed by the alcohol formation in the presence of triethylamine, water and dimethylformamide23 was realized in quantitative yield. Protection of the resulting alcohol as a silyl ether29 yielded compound 9 in a \u03b1/\u03b2 1:0.9 ratio. We then needed to change the benzoyl protecting groups of the sugar since the basic conditions used to remove them are not compatible with the presence of the future phosphoramidate group. In a recent paper, Schinazi and co-workers30 explained that a benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group was well-adapted with synthesis of nucleoside aryloxy phosphoramidate prodrugs: this protecting group is easy to introduce, and the neutral conditions used to remove it are compatible with the presence of the phosphoramidate group. So we decided to apply this group to our strategy of synthesis. Compound 9 was deprotected under basic conditions and the resulting diol was protected in the presence of benzyl chloroformate to yield quantitatively compound 11 in a \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio 1:1. Deprotection of the anomeric position was tried in several conditions (TBAF, NH4F, HCl, TFA) but the yields were low (0\u201320%) in all these conditions. Thus, we finally decided to perform the deprotection in the presence of HF-pyridine,29 and in this case the yield was quantitative and the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio changed to 1:0.2. Thanks to the literature,31 it was easy to discriminate the \u03b1 from the \u03b2 diastereoisomers: the \u03b1 anomers had J\n1,2\n = 0 Hz, confirming that H1 and H2 were trans to each other, so the NMR signal of H2 was a doublet with J\n2-F\n = 49-50 Hz. In the case of the \u03b2 anomer, J\n1-F\n = 0 Hz, which confirmed that H1 and 2F were trans to each other, and the signal of H2 was in this case a ddd (with a general range of J\n1,2\n = 4 Hz, J\n2-F\n = 50 Hz, J\n2,3\n = 6 Hz). Finally, coupling of compound 12 with the appropriate aryloxy phosphorochloridates followed by deprotection of the benzyloxy carbonyl protecting groups25 yielded the desired 2-fluoro-2-deoxyarabinose-1-phosphate prodrugs 14a\u2013h. Their successful isolation highlights the change in stability upon 2-fluorination.",

Reduction of the lactone 15 was achieved in the presence of LiAl(OtBu)3H and the resulting alcohol was protected as a silyl ether with 46% yield. We were also able to isolate a mixture of the monobenzoylated sugars 18 and 19 with 31% yield but this partial deprotection was acceptable as the next step consisted in removing all the benzoyl esters. Protection of the resulting 3 and 5 alcohols was achieved in the presence of benzyl chloroformate and deprotection of the silyl ether at the anomeric position was done with HF-Pyridine and yielded compound 22 in a 1:0.6 \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio. The coupling reaction of the compound 22 with the appropriate phosphorochloridates was done in the presence of tBuMgCl, and the final step consisted in the hydrogenolysis of the benzyloxycarbonyl groups which led to the desired prodrugs of 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate (with yields of between 24% and 68% over the two last steps). For each compound, \u03b1 anomers 25 and \u03b2 anomers 24 were isolated as a mixture of PS and PR diastereoisomers. In order to characterize the two anomers we performed different experiments. We first examined the NOE effects between the H1 and H4 protons, without success. So we based our study on the literature:32 in the \u03b2 anomer the signal of the fluorines are close to each other (\u2212125 and \u2212127 ppm in 19F NMR), whereas in the \u03b1 anomer, the two signals are much more separated (\u2212110 and \u2212126 ppm in 19F NMR).",
