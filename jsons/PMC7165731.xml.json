Thus, IFITM3 restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza (Everitt et al.,2012) and mediates cellular resistance to influenza A H1N1 virus (Brass et al.,2009; Everitt etal.,2012; Huang et al.,2011; Lu et al.,2011; Schoggins et al.,2011), dengue virus (Brass etal.,2009), SARS coronavirus (Lu et al.,2011), and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (Schoggins et al.,2011; Yount et al.,2010). The role of IFITM3 in the central nervous system (CNS) is largely unknown, although its increased expression has been demonstrated in the brains of patients with neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia (Arion et al.,2007), autism (Garbett etal.,2008), bipolar disorder (Iwamoto et al.,2004), and Alzheimer's disease (Ricciarelli et al.,2004). Conversely, we previously demonstrated that neonatal treatment of mice with polyriboinosinic\u2010polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C, an inducer of innate immune responses via toll\u2010like receptor 3) caused a significant increase in IFITM3 mRNA levels in the hippocampus, which resulted in long\u2010lasting brain dysfunction, including cognitive and emotional impairments as well as a deficit in depolarization\u2010evoked glutamate release in the hippocampus in adulthood (Ibi et al.,2009).",

We demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression of IFITM3 in the early endosomes of astrocytes following an immune challenge impairs endocytic activity, leading to the disruption of the neurotrophic effects of astrocytes and the consequent neurodevelopmental and cognitive abnormalities in mice. Accordingly, astroglial IFITM3 may contribute to neuronal impairments that could be induced by immune inflammatory reactions in the immature brain (Hagberg et al.,2012; Mwaniki et al.,2012), even though it mediates cellular resistance to various viruses in the lungs and other peripheral organs (Brass et al.,2009; Everitt et al.,2012; Huang et al.,2011; Lu et al.,2011; Schoggins et al.,2011; Yount et al.,2010).",

Endocytosis consists of two different systems, namely, clathrin\u2010dependent and \u2010independent (Leonard et al.,2008). Accordingly, we analyzed the uptake of Alexa Fluor 555\u2010labeled transferrin (AF555\u2010Tf) and Alexa Fluor 555\u2010labeled epidermal growth factor (AF555\u2010EGF) as a measure of clathrin\u2010dependent and \u2010independent endocytosis, respectively. Knockdown of eea1, necessary for endosomal trafficking, in cultured astrocytes markedly reduced the endocytic activity of AF555\u2010EGF (Supp. Info.

In contrast, IFITM3 overexpression in COS7 cells had no effect on AF555\u2010Tf recycling (Fig. 7D), which also agrees with the effect of eea1 knockdown in COS7 cells (Leonard etal.,2008). To confirm the effect of IFITM3 on endocytosis in cultured astrocytes, AF555\u2010Tf and AF555\u2010EGF uptake was measured in polyI:C\u2010treated wt and ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes. PolyI:C treatment markedly reduced AF555\u2010Tf and AF555\u2010EGF uptake in wt astrocytes (Fig. 8A,B). The reduction of AF555\u2010EGF uptake was completely abolished in ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes, while AF555\u2010Tf uptake was partially reversed in ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (Fig. 8A,B). The latter phenomena may be explained by the observation that dsRNA suppresses clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis (DeWitte\u2010Orr et al.,2010). Finally, to ascertain whether AF555\u2010EGF uptake is mediated by clathrin\u2010independent endocytosis under our experimental conditions (Leonard et al.,2008; Sigismund et al.,2008), we measured its uptake in the presence of chlorpromazine (CPM), an inhibitor of clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis. The reduction of AF555\u2010EGF uptake in IFITM3\u2010transfected COS7 cells and polyI:C\u2010treated astrocytes was not influenced by CPM treatment (Fig. 8A,B).\n",

They possess two transmembrane domains and an intervening highly conserved intracellular loop (pfam04505, CD225, interferon\u2010induced transmembrane protein) with both amino\u2010 and carboxy\u2010domains being luminal (Brass et al.,2009; Tanaka et al.,2005). A recent study, however, suggest that both amino\u2010 and carboxy\u2010domains of IFITM3 face the cytoplasm (Yount et al.,2012). IFITM1, 2, and 3 are expressed in a wide range of tissues, whereas IFITM5 expression appears to be limited to bone (Moffatt et al.,2008). Mouse IFITM3, which is expressed in primordial germ cells, had been implicated in germ cell development, but Lange et al. (2008) demonstrated that the deletion of Ifitm3 had no detectable effects on the development of germ line or on the generation, suggesting that Ifitm3 is not essential for germ cell development. Meanwhile, recent studies demonstrated that IFITM3 contributed to antiviral responses of the type I IFNs (Brass et al.,2009; Everitt et al.,2012; Schoggins et al.,2011).",

To clarify the molecular mechanism by which IFITM3 regulates endosomal function, we examined the protein\u2010protein interactions of IFITM3 with reported partners, such as visfatin (Zhang et al.,2008), and ATP6V0B (Wee et al.,2012), as well as with other modulators of endocytic activity, such as kinesin (Soldati and Schliwa,2006), and the small GTPase RalA (Feig,2003), using an immunoprecipitation assay. The apparent interactions of these molecules, however, were not observed in brain extracts from polyI:C\u2010treated neonatal mice (Supp. Info.

Alternatively, as demonstrated by a recent study, S\u2010palmitoylation and ubiquitination of IFITM3 may play a role in the regulation of endosomal function in astrocytes (Yount et al.,2012, 2010).",

The results revealed that among genes whose expression ratio in polyI:C\u2010treated astrocytes was significantly altered by more than fourfold from the level in vehicle\u2010treated control astrocytes, fourteen genes were significantly increased and one gene was decreased in polyI:C\u2010treated astrocytes compared to those in vehicle\u2010treated astrocytes (Supp. Info. Fig. 6). Genes that showed an increased expression by polyI:C treatment include interleukin\u201012\u03b2 (IL\u201012\u03b2), interleukin 1 family, member 6 (IL\u20101f6), interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2), interleukin\u201027 (IL\u201027), interleukin\u201019 (IL\u201019), tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 10 (Tnfsf10), interferon\u2010\u03b21 (IFN\u2010\u03b21), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11 (Tnfsf11), growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5), tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 8 (Tnfsf8) and interleukin\u201021 (IL\u201021), whereas the decrease was observed in interleukin\u20104 (IL\u20104). Inflammatory cytokines induced by polyI:C treatment in astrocytes may be potential candidates of the humoral factors derived from polyI:C\u2010treated astrocytes; for instance, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 are known to inhibit neurite outgrowth (Gilmore et al.,2004; Neumann et al.,2002; Wellen et al.,2009), whereas IL\u20104 is reported to have neurotrophic actions (Brodie etal.,1998); thus, thedecrease of IL\u20104 expression by polyI:C may lead to the impaired maturation of cultured neurons. We confirmed the increases in protein levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 in polyI:C\u2010ACM, but there were no significant differences in the protein levels of these cytokines in polyI:C\u2010ACM between wt and ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes. It is unlikely, therefore, that these cytokines including TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 play major roles in polyI:C\u2010induced IFITM3\u2010mediated impairment of neurite outgrowth and spine formation in vitro.",

Glutamate is another possible candidate since it is reported that polyI:C treatment reduces the expression of glutamate\u2010aspartate transporter in astrocytes (Scumpia et al.,2005), which may result in the increase of extracellular glutamate levels, leading to the inhibition of neurite outgrowth and spine formation (Maezawa and Jin,2010).",

Accordingly, it is suggested that the reduction of endocytic activity in astrocytes caused by IFITM3 overexpression after polyI:C treatment may affect the composition of the extracellular humoral factors of astrocytes, e.g., neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and gliotransmitters, leading to neurodevelopmental abnormalities via the disruption of neuron\u2010glia interactions (Fig. 9).
