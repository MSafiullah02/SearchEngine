However, there are concerning elements to this emerging infectious agent, including a greater R0, initial greater estimated mortality, and no inherent immunity in global populations. Though data remains limited, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the dynamics of this emerging epidemic at both the individual\u2010 and population\u2010based levels, learn how to recognize those patients at risk or suffering from COVID\u201019, and prepare to treat these patients in their clinical practice.",
