The 150 kDa APN glycoprotein (EC 3.4.11.2) is composed of 967 amino acids and is expressed in a variety of tissues including cells of the monocytic and granulocytic lineage, synaptic membranes of the central nervous system, and intestinal, lung and kidney epithelial cells.9 A soluble form of APN is reported to be present in human plasma.10 The physiological role of APN includes the conversion of oligopeptides in the small intestinal lumen into amino acids, and an involvement in the degradation of regulatory peptides in other tissues such as the kidney and the brain.9 The human APN gene has been mapped to chromosome 15q25-26, and the coding part of the gene is divided in 20 exons.11., 12. Expression of APN is regulated by two different promoters, separated by an 8 kb intron, leading to the formation of two transcripts that only differ in their 5\u2032 non-coding region. The epithelial promoter is located close to the coding part of the gene and is active in enterocytes and other epithelial cells, while the more upstream myeloid promoter is mainly active in myeloid cells.13 Two splice variants in which exon 3 and exon 14 were lost, have recently been identified, resulting in both cases in a carboxy-terminal truncated protein.14\n",

In our search for polymorphisms in the APN domain that is essential for its HCoV-229E receptor function, we identified seven polymorphisms, of which four were located in the non-coding intron 3. In 25% of the Belgian individuals one or more of these seven variations were found. Haplotype analysis revealed the presence of five haplotypes in the population. Three polymorphisms in APN exon 4 (C956T, G978T and G987A) in association with an intron 3 variation (C389T), were identified at a relatively high allele frequency (8.5%) in our Belgian population. Fifteen heterozygotes and one homozygote for these four variations were observed. One of the exon 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms is a C to T mutation, C956T, leading to an amino acid change in codon 311. This alanine to valine substitution, a conservative amino acid change, has already been described in a population of Italian coeliac disease patients, in which it was observed with an allele frequency of 7.9%.24 In our population, this polymorphism was approximately equally frequent (8.5%). The C956T polymorphism was always found in combination with the two other observed exon 4 variations (G978T and G987A) and one intron 3 variation (C389T). Haploid DNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of these four variations on the same allele. Here we report for the first time an association between the C956T polymorphism and other variations in the APN gene. Absolute linkage between the SNPs within this short physical distance is commonly observed. Apart from the codon 311 variation (C956T), none of the other associated polymorphisms has an apparent functional effect, as the codon 318 and 321 variations (G978T and G987A) are silent, and C389T is located in an intron.",

            "text": "Recent studies revealed that the human APN gene is subject to alternative splicing, and two splice variants, in which exon 3 and exon 14 were lost, have been identified.14 Alternative splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein isoforms to be created from a single gene. The splicing process is regulated by both cis- and trans-acting factors, which control the choice of 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice sites either positively or negatively. Cis-acting regulatory elements include exonic or intronic splice enhancers or silencers, which can be changed by mutations with a possible effect on mRNA splicing.25., 26. In this perspective, the importance of silent mutations or intron variations, which seem to have no apparent functional effect, should be reconsidered. Supporting this assumption, a silent mutation (C77G) in exon 4 of the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45 gene has been shown to increase the expression of an aberrant exon 4-included CD45 by disrupting the activity of an exonic splice silencer. An association of this silent mutation with multiple sclerosis has been suggested.27 In this way, it might be possible that the silent mutations in APN exon 4 and the APN intron 3 variations that we observed in our population could be of functional importance.",
