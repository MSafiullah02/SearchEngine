On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak, which is phylogenetically in the SARS-CoV clade. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergence of the novel coronavirus as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) (Eurosurveillance Editorial, 2020), which is the sixth PHEIC under the International Health Regulations (IHR). On Feb 11, 2020, this novel coronavirus was officially named as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. Up to 9 March 2020, 109,577 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 3809 deaths, have been reported worldwide, mainly in Hubei province of China (67,743 cases, 3007 deaths), and 28,673 cases from 104 other countries around the world with accordance to World Health Organization (Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV) : Situation Report -49, 2020). As Wuhan city is a major transportation hub with a population of more than 11 million people, the potential impact of global COVID-19 outbreaks is high. Such outbreaks of infectious disease has significant potential for psychological contagion, and typically result in widespread fear, anxiety and a variety of psychological problems, and then incur stigmatization of patients with the disease and their relations, of care workers, even of all residents in hardest-hit areas (Mak et al., 2010; Perrin et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "Post-traumatic Stress symptoms (PTSS) follows traumatic occurrences outside the range of common human experience such as violent physical assaults, torture, accidents, rape or natural disasters and is characterized by a typical symptom pattern of intrusions, persistence of trauma, relevant stimuli avoidance, emotional numbing and physiological hyper-arousal (Deja et al., 2006) . Several studies have explored the psychological effect during such epidemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1. One study reported that 3.7% of public cases, including 9.6% of \"impacted group\" (they or their friends and family had been quarantined, or suspected of being infected), had experienced depression symptoms since the SARS outbreak (Ko et al., 2006) . Another study showed 17.3% significant mental symptoms among health care workers during SARS epidemic (Lu et al., 2006) . As to research on PTSS, Mak et al. (2010) and Lam et al. (2009) both reported more than 40% of SARS survivors had experienced PTSS at one time during the outbreak. Meanwhile, those respondents who had been isolated, worked in high-risk workplaces such as SARS wards, or had friends or close relatives who contacted SARS were two to three times more likely to develop high levels of PTSS than those who were not exposed to the virus (Wu et al., 2009) As the number of infections increasing, the lack of clear and definite information of virus from the media, the shortage of medical workers and resources, and the lack of masks and protecting supplies in the marketplace resulted in the Chinese people, especially Wuhan residents, suffering intense anxiety due to the uncertainty and insecurity they experienced in the first several weeks. Since the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020, people bombarded with various discomforting network information, the mental health of public in Wuhan and surrounding cities should not be overlooked either. Although the psychosocial impact will cause a huge impediment to COVID-19 control in these regions, there are barely reports focusing on it so far, except that the local government of Wuhan has implemented policies to address these mental health problems for medical works (Kang et al., 2020) .",

The exclusion criterion was that the answer time for all 39-items questions was more than 30 min or less than 2 min.

Each item reflected the severity of a particular symptom, rated on a five-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) during the previous month. The score of each symptom cluster was calculated as the sum of the corresponding items. PTSS severity (total symptoms) was defined as the sum of the scores of all PCL-5 symptom clusters. The PCL-5 can determine a provisional diagnosis in two ways, a) the presence (endorsed as 2 or greater) of at least one re-experiencing symptom (Criterion B item; questions 1-5), one avoidance symptom (Criterion C item; questions 6-7), two negative alterations in cognition or mood symptoms (Criterion D items; questions 8-14) and two arousal symptoms (Criterion E items; questions 15-20), and b) the sum of total score over cutpoint score of 33 point.

This psychiatrically outbreak seems to have an even greater impact on the public. The reason for this is that most PTSS cases in the current study are actually acute stress disorders instead of chronic psychiatrically problems. It is suggested that most of these acute episodes resembling PTSS may abate in the ensuing period, and only a minority develops chronic disorders (Bryant, 2003) . Considering the current epidemic situation that COVID-19 is still dominating headlines throughout the world, the quarantine of Hubei province even China will not be lifted in the near future.
