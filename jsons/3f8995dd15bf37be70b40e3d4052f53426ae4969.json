World health organization (WHO) has expressed fears that Pakistan might emerge as the next epicenter of this pandemic. We hypothesize that at present the Pakistani masses are not prepared to face any threat of a looming epidemic. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the basic knowledge of educational and health care workers (HCWs) regarding COVID-19, its control, and prevention. Knowledge about origin, symptoms, and spread of viral infection was assessed. In this cross-sectional survey, a selfdesigned questionnaire was distributed among 302 HCWs including physicians (10.9%), nurses (1.32%), lab staff (1.65%), and academic individuals including faculty and students (86.42%) of different organizations. Results were analyzed using the \u03c7 2 test. Obtained results validate our null hypothesis that Pakistani masses are not well aware of the COVID-19 and strategies for the prevention and control of infection.",

[4] [5] [6] At present as the world health organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic, Pakistan is facing a critical situation and strict measures need to be taken to avert the threat of a national health crisis. WHO has expressed its fears that Pakistan is facing a major COVID-19 challenge. They mentioned that if effective measurements are not taken Pakistan might emerge as the next epicenter of this pandemic. [7] [8] [9] It is believed that insufficient consideration is given to the basic infection control protocols including hand washing and personal protective equipment use in the educational and health care institutes of the country. The Ministry of Health, Pakistan has declared new guidelines for infection control which are based on the WHO recommendations. 10 However, the implementation of the basic infection control protocols is possible only when people and employees are made aware of the introduced policies by giving them clear guidelines. Awareness level and compliance of the educational and healthcare workers play an important role in the effective and timely prevention and control of a public health crisis. 11 To formulate a healthy policy, the multi-disciplinary teams including key front-line workers should be a part of the policy planning to ensure that these policies function effectively. 12 Pakistan faces many specific challenges about infection control that must be met by devising national policies.",

According to the profession, the distribution of responses to the questions was varied, so we checked whether gender has any impact on responses. However, both male and female response distribution is very much similar. (Table 2) . Also, concerning the organization, there is a significant variation in the distribution of age groups ( \u03c7 2 33.036; P value .001). It was mainly observed that in Government and private hospital participants were more likely falling in 25-to 50-year group that is below 25 years were lesser than expected, whereas educational institute participants were more likely to be falling in below 25 years than expected as compared to the 25-to 50-year group where the ratio of expected is higher than the observed.",

P value of .022 suggested the significant result that the variable (profession and awareness of the viral origin were related). The third question posed was 'are you aware of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19\u2032? 91.3% of people said that they knew the signs and symptoms while 4.97% said that they were not aware of them while 3.64% said that maybe they were aware and maybe not. P value .257 suggests that variables (profession and awareness of signs and symptoms are not linked). The fourth query posed was \"does having flu, fever, and cough means that you are infected.\"Response reflected that 10.26% of people said yes, 43.38% said no and 46.36% reported maybe. A P value of .155 suggests that the profession and awareness of COVID-19 symptoms are not linked. From our results, it is clear that most people have heard about the name and origin of COVID-19 but people who think that they are aware of signs and symptoms are not aware of it. Physicians seemed to be most aware of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 indicating that awareness level is linked to the profession of an individual. There were insignificant variations in response to the query concerning the acquisition of infection from an incoming parcel from china presented in a P value of .285. From the total respondents, 25.17% of people answered yes while 40.4% in no and 34.44% responded maybe. Concerning the acquisition of infection from pets (question 7) insignificant results were obtained (P value .285). A total of 34.44% of people are of the view that they can get it from pets while 40.73% think that it is not possible while 24.83% are uncertain about this query. These results indicate that people in Pakistan are uncertain of the viral acquisition routes and the majority will not follow the standard precautionary measures. Significant data (P value .042) was obtained regarding knowledge about other pandemic viral infections of the past. A total of 70.86% of individuals knew of the past pandemic, 19.21% didn't know of any pandemic of the past while 9.93% were uncertain. Regarding information about how the viral transmission can be stopped in Pakistan, respondents were uncertain, and result obtained was not significant (P value .181). The 73.84% of respondents believed that viral transmission in Pakistan can be prevented, while 3.97% said that it cannot be prevented. In 22.19% respondent's uncertainty was observed. Pakistani people are well aware of the pandemics of the past but many people are uncertain that the looming threat of an upcoming COVID-19 epidemic can be averted.",

In all these cases, staff training, and strict implementation of rules and regulations, effective development of policies and specific guidelines relating to virus spread are required, and all organizations and hospitals need to ensure the proper implementation of the government policies. To make the HCWs well prepared in Pakistan to find this COVID-19 pandemic, a series of proper trainings are required.
