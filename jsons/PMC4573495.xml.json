Sequencing viral metagenomes from various environments has revealed that viruses are the most numerous and diverse organisms on Earth [2\u20134] and that, likely, only a small proportion of them are harmful pathogens. The results of these studies, coupled with the finding of many \u201cgood viruses\u201d, suggest viruses could now often be considered mutualistic symbionts, fully integrated in holobionts, which have been defined as organisms harboring and interacting with a diverse microbial community [5, 6]. Viruses are thought to be at least as old as cellular organisms and it is becoming increasingly clear that they have had a strong, long-lasting, and ongoing influence on the evolution of their hosts and on ecosystem function [7\u201310].",

            "text": "The recent discovery that many viral genomes integrate into the genome of their eukaryotic hosts has shed new light on our understanding of viral evolution and on the evolution of host-virus interactions [11, 12]. Paleovirology, the study of these endogenous viral elements (EVEs), has produced several major breakthroughs. First, we have learned that many extant viral families are much older than what was previously thought and that fast rates of evolution inferred from currently circulating viruses cannot be extrapolated over long evolutionary periods of time [12]. Other interesting outcomes of paleovirology studies include, much like viral metagenomics, the dramatic expansion of the host ranges for viral families. For example, in a recent study, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic screen for EVEs in the genome of a terrestrial crustacean isopod, the pill bug Armadillidium vulgare [13]. We uncovered 54 EVEs from 10 diverse lineages belonging to the Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae and Totiviridae families as well as to the Mononegavirales order, indicating that isopods have been and may still be exposed to a remarkable diversity of viruses. These findings extended the host range of all five viral groups to isopod crustaceans, and led to the question of whether A. vulgare is unique in terms of abundance and diversity of EVEs among crustaceans or if a diverse EVE biota is characteristic of the group as a whole. In order to address this question, and to shed new light on the dynamics of viral endogenization more generally, we extended our screen to another species of terrestrial isopod (A. nasatum) and to five additional crustacean species (two species of water flea [Daphnia pulex and Daphnia pulicaria], a marine copepod [Eurytemora affinis], a freshwater amphipod [Hyalella azteca], and the salmon louse [Lepeophtheirus salmonis; Copepoda]; Additional file 1: Figure S1).",

First, assuming that exogenous viruses were sequenced and assembled together with the targeted crustacean genomes, we should have been able to uncover entire viral genomes. Yet, our search only revealed pieces of viral genomes (Fig. 2). Secondly, the method used to sequence the six crustacean genomes did not involve a reverse transcription step, and thus did not allow sequencing of any RNA molecule. Yet, many of the EVEs we found originate from exogenous RNA viruses (Bunyaviriridae, Mononegavirales and Totiviridae). Thirdly, the presence of all 12 EVEs we targeted in isopods was confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing (see below).",

[16]), which varies greatly between species (Additional file 4: Table S1). Regarding the mechanisms underlying integration of viral genomes into crustacean genomes, we could not detect any sequence signature indicative of transposition-mediated or microhomology-mediated insertion. However, we found that several EVEs share the same putative flanking region within a given species (Additional file 3: Table S2), indicating that they were likely generated by post-insertional duplication (one such duplication in E. affinis, in D. pulex, in H. azteca and in L. salmonis; three such events in D. pulicaria; Additional file 3: Table S2).",

Our in silico search for orthologous EVEs revealed three loci shared between A. vulgare and A. nasatum for which the host origin of the flanking region could be identified unambiguously (Additional file 8: Figure S5): A. nasatum Bunyavirus-like EVE 12, A. nasatum Circovirus-like 50 and A. nasatum Circovirus-like EVE 44. Not only are the flanking regions of these loci not similar to any known viral sequence, but they are characterized by the presence of interspersed and/or long microsatellite repeats (repeated at least six times or more). Such repeats are absent from the genome of all viruses belonging to the Circoviridae and Bunyaviridae, indicating that what we have identified as flanking regions indeed correspond to the eukaryotic host (Armadillidium) rather than the viral genome (Additional file 8: Figure S5). In addition to the sequences obtained from the genome sequence of A. nasatum and A. vulgare, we were able to PCR/Sanger sequence the three loci in A. tunisiense and one of them in A. depressum (Additional file 8: Figure S5). All EVEs identified computationally in A. nasatum or using PCR/sequencing were deposited in Genbank under accession numbers KT713978 \u2013 KT714035.",

Here, we show that members of all five viral groups found in A. vulgare (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae, Totiviridae) have also become endogenized in another terrestrial isopod, A. nasatum, and that four other crustacean species each harbor a viral flora composed of a subset of these five viral groups as well. Interestingly, all but one EVE lineage found in A. nasatum group with those previously identified in A. vulgare, which suggest that the two species are infected by the same viruses, an observation which is consistent with the fact that the distribution of the two species largely overlaps in Europe and that they are often found in the same habitats [39]. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses revealed that crustacean EVEs tend to group by taxa in distinct, well supported clusters across no fewer than 14 distinct viral lineages: four Bunyaviridae, five Mononegavirales (including a new Armadillidium lineage in A. nasatum), two Circoviridae, two Parvoviridae and one Totiviridae, 10 of which were also found in the initial screen of A. vulgare [13].",

This leads to three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) that these five viral groups are simply the most widespread in crustaceans, (2) these viral groups are more likely to endogenize than other viruses without being more prevalent as exogenous viruses, or (3) that crustacean genomes are uniquely vulnerable to endogenization by these 5 groups, relative to other host genomes. We note that a member of at least one other viral family (Nimaviridae) has been unearthed from a crustacean genome [40], and we believe that as more metagenomics and paleovirology studies are conducted, comparing global patterns of endogenization and global viral flora of extant viruses in a given taxonomic group will yield interesting insights into the ecology of host/virus interactions. But our current knowledge in this area is still too limited to draw any firm conclusion on this aspect of our results.",

Because this pattern is consistent throughout all five viral groups, we believe it is most likely explained by the strong purifying selection pressures acting on viral polymerases [41\u201344], leading to a high degree of conservation of such proteins between viruses that were endogenized and extant exogenous viruses. The other structural proteins (coat or capsid proteins) tend to be involved in more direct interactions with host factors (such as cell receptors) and are key to the entry of the virus in the cell. Thus, they are more likely to be engaged in an evolutionary arms race with the host and to evolve under rapid positive selection (e.g. [45, 46]). The level of similarity of such proteins between endogenized viruses and extant ones is therefore expected to be lower than that observed for polymerases.",

            "text": "The crustacean EVEs detected in this study show various levels of degradation when compared to their closest exogenous virus relatives, some being intact or disrupted by just one or a few mutations inducing a stop codon and/or a frameshift and others being heavily degraded by more than 10 nonsense mutations (Additional file 3: Table S2). This pattern indicates that viral endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the taxa included in this study. Further suggesting recurrent endogenization over time, we identified three EVEs shared at orthologous loci between A. nasatum and two or three other Armadillidium species (Additional file 8: Figure S5), and we were unable to amplify three other EVEs by PCR in one or two A. nasatum individuals sampled from a different population than the one used for genome sequencing (Table 1). These data indicate that, while some EVEs are old and were endogenized before the split between A. nasatum and the other Armadillidium species, others are more recent and are likely to still be polymorphic (with respect to presence/absence patterns) in A. nasatum. The phylogenetic relationships of the three Armadillidium species included in our study have yet to be robustly resolved, but the mitochondrial COI gene from the two most distantly relatives (A. nasatum and A. vulgare, according to Dupeyron et al. [47]) differ by 16 %. Considering the proposed COI substitution rate of 1.4 % per million years in decapods [48], we can infer that the EVEs detected in isopods result from recurrent endogenization events that took place over several millions of years during the evolution of terrestrial isopods. The three EVEs that became endogenous in the ancestor of the A. nasatum + A. vulgare clade are all disrupted by one to four nonsense mutations and we did not find evidence for their transcription in the transcriptome of A. nasatum and A. vulgare [49]. Thus unlike previously described examples in non-crustacean taxa (e.g. [50, 51]), these three isopod EVEs do not appear to evolve under purifying selection and to fulfill a cellular function. Their maintenance in isopod genomes over several millions of years is therefore either completely neutral or due to initial exaptation, followed by loss of function and ongoing degradation as proposed for Syncytin genes in primates [52].",

Viruses have an important impact on the structure and ecology of phytoplankton communities [54], and it has recently been suggested they may play an important role in shaping mesozooplankton communities as well [38]. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that copepods can serve as vectors for transmitting viruses to fish and shrimp, causing important economic losses [55, 56], and to phytoplankton, with possible consequences on global biogeochemical cycling [57]. Despite these major consequences, only one study has characterized viral infections in copepods so far [38]. Interestingly, many of the copepod EVEs are devoid of nonsense mutation (Additional file 3: Table S2), suggesting they were endogenized very recently and may still be very similar at the nucleotide level to currently circulating viruses.",

Most EVEs correspond to non-structural viral proteins, likely reflecting the slower rate of change of these proteins as compared to structural proteins. Interestingly, we found that four viral groups (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) are widespread in crustaceans, being present in three to four highly divergent taxa (amphipods, copepods, isopods, branchiopods) and that all viral groups found in non-isopod crustaceans are present in isopods. We anticipate that further large scale paleovirology and metagenomics studies will shed light on the factors shaping global patterns of viral endogenizations and the composition of the viral communities currently circulating in a given taxonomic group. Finally, the sequences of recent EVEs that we identified in this study could facilitate the discovery of new exogenous viruses through targeted searches. The characterization of EVEs not only serves to provide a catalog of paleoviral events shedding light on past host-virus interactions but it can also help discovering new viruses in ecologically and/or economically important taxa (e.g. the copepods E. affinis and L. salmonis).",

Many tblastx hits were false positives corresponding to repeated sequences or to eukaryote genes that are present in viruses following host-to-virus horizontal transfers, known to be common in large dsDNA viruses [13, 61\u201363]. In order to remove these false-positive sequences, a reciprocal blastp was carried out using the tblastx fasta output as query on the \u201cnr\u201d (non-redundant) Genbank protein database, to eliminate any sequences for which the best reciprocal blastp hit was not a virus.

We also investigated whether these EVEs are present at orthologous sites in three other closely related isopod species (A. depressum, A. tunisiense and A. vulgare). For this analysis, we selected the two EVEs of each viral group (four for Circoviridae because we found many more EVEs for this viral group) with the longest flanking regions. We then designed PCR primers to the flanking regions (Additional file 9: Table S3) and conducted a series of PCR screens on three A. nasatum DNA samples, one A. vulgare sample, one A. depressum sample, and one A. tunisiense sample. Genomic DNA extraction followed the Wilson protocol [68] which involved 3 h incubation of the tissue sample in proteinase-K at 56 \u00b0C, centrifugation (8000 g, 2 min), and an RNAse treatment (30 min at 37 \u00b0C). DNA samples were then purified using spin columns from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR reactions were carried out in 25 \u03bcl with 5 \u03bcL Buffer 5X, 0.5 \u03bcL dNTPs (2.15 mM), 1 \u03bcL of each primer (100 \u03bcM), 0.25 \u03bcL Taq polymerase 5 u/\u03bcL, 1 \u03bcL DNA. Thermocycling consisted of a 94 \u00b0C phase for 4 min, then 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 55 \u00b0C and 50 s at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72 \u00b0C. PCR products resulting from amplifications in species other than A. nasatum were systematically purified and Sanger sequenced.",

For this we used all A. nasatum EVEs flanked on one or both sides by at least 150 bp of sequence showing no similarity to any virus as queries to perform blastn searches on A. vulgare sequences (using the sequences published in Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al. [13]). Our identification of EVE flanking regions first relies on the fact that these regions are not similar to any known virus. In order to verify that they correspond to the host genome, we searched for the presence of known proteins motifs using these regions as queries to perform blastx searches against the Genbank non-redundant protein database. We also searched for the presence of interspersed repeats, which are typically abundant in eukaryotic genomes but very rare in viruses in general and absent from the genomes of Bunyaviridae and Circoviridae (the two viral families to which belong the three EVEs for which we found repeats in their flanking regions). For this we used each EVE flanking region as a query to perform blastn searches against the host genome it was extracted from. We considered interspersed repeats as regions longer than 100 bp repeated at least 10 times in the Armadillidium nasatum genome. The CENSOR searches we ran in Repbase [69] on the two interspersed repeats that we identified did not reveal any similarity to any known transposable element.",
