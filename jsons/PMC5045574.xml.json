These patients more frequently present with septic shock and need for mechanical ventilation, with a mortality of approximately 29 % [2]. In addition to the infection, septic shock is generally thought to be caused by an excessive or uncontrolled pro-inflammatory response [3].",

The use of corticosteroids accelerated the resolution of symptoms and time to clinical stability (defined as improvement in chest X-ray and normalization of temperature, respiratory rate, and inflammatory markers). Corticosteroids provided no benefit in terms of mortality and the authors concluded that it was not possible to make any definitive recommendations because the studies analyzed in the meta-analysis did not provide strong evidence. Another meta-analysis [20] including nine RCTs with a total of 1001 patients showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with significantly lower mortality considering all the patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.37\u20131.04; p = 0.07). However, a survival benefit was detected in the subgroup of patients with severe CAP (OR 0.26, 95 % CI 0.11\u20130.64; p = 0.003) and among patients receiving more prolonged corticosteroid treatment (OR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.26\u20130.97; p = 0.04).

In the study, the time to clinical stability was defined as the days until reaching stable vital signs for 24 h or longer (including normalization of temperature, heart rate, spontaneous respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, mental status, ability for oral intake, and adequate oxygenation on room air). The complications related to pneumonia were not significantly different in the groups whereas the prednisone group more frequently presented hyperglycemia needing insulin treatment (19 versus 11 %; OR 1.96; 95 % CI 1.31\u20132.93; p = 0.001). However, other adverse events typically associated with corticosteroid use (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, nosocomial infections) were rare and similar in both groups. The mortality rate, considered as a secondary outcome in the study, was not different in the two groups (n = 16 (4 %) in the prednisone group versus n = 13 (3 %) in the placebo group; p = 0.57). This study presented some limitations, in particular the use of a weak outcome such as clinical stability, which included some items such as temperature that could be influenced by the use of corticosteroids.

We used intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 0.5/mg/kg every 12 h for 5 days. We included only patients with severe CAP, defined according to the modified American Thoracic Society criteria or by a Pneumonia Severity Index risk class V [27]. The patients receiving corticosteroids had significantly lower treatment failure in comparison with the placebo group (13 versus 31 %, respectively; p = 0.02). This difference was due to late treatment failure (developing between 72 and 120 h after treatment initiation) and, in particular, patients in the corticosteroid group showed a more evident effect on the reduction of radiological progression (2 versus 15 %; p = 0.007). Indeed, the use of corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by 18 % (95 % CI 3\u201332 %) in the intention to treat analysis. The association between treatment failure, with radiographic progression as a criterion, and mortality has been shown by Menendez et al. [5]. The protective effect of corticosteroids on radiographic progression could be interpreted as an effect preventing the development of ARDS or blocking the Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer-like reaction [8]. No significant difference was observed in mortality between the two groups (10 % in the methylprednisolone arm versus 15 % in the placebo arm; p = 0.37); however, the study was not powered for mortality as this was not the primary outcome. Importantly, we detected no significant side effects in patients receiving corticosteroids. The strength of this study is the homogeneous population with severe CAP and a strong inflammatory response and the use of an outcome (treatment failure) closely associated with mortality [5]. The limitation of this study was the prolonged recruitment period.",

The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration. For example, the use of 40 mg of prednisolone per day for more than 1 week or 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent per day for a month can produce immunosuppression. In acute infection, a low dose for a short period (some days) may be useful for reducing inflammation and may not cause so much harm by producing immunosuppression.

The mechanisms responsible for the favorable effects related to the use of macrolides are not clear and have been attributed in part to their immunomodulatory effect, as observed in some studies [41].
