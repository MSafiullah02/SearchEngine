HAdV are a common cause mainly of respiratory infections and, typically in men who have sex with men, a cause of urethritis and conjunctivitis.50 Respiratory infection caused by HAdV in immunocompetent people is typically caused by HAdV-3, mild and self-limited. However, more recently HAdV-55 in particular has been found to cause severe community-acquired pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults,51 mainly from China. HAdV pneumonia typically is found in neonates, immunocompromised people, and school or military camp populations. HAdV infections in immunocompromised individuals can be severe and life-threatening. The past decade has also seen the emergence in resource-rich countries of several other new viruses\u2014often in traveling people\u2014including HAdV-14p1.52 HAdV can be found in saliva3 and it is presumed that it can transmit infection though the main routes are through respiratory droplets or touching infected objects. Adenoviruses can survive a long time on objects and spread easily. Adenoviral shedding in saliva and feces has also been reported after p53 adenoviral gene therapy in some patients with esophageal cancer.53\n",

Any risks of transmission from saliva appear not well-defined, and reliable evidence for virus transmission through kissing is sparse. Nevertheless, this route may be one where the flaviviruses at least may well spread. In this regard, the number of emerging viral diseases has increased dramatically in recent decades. In an ever more global society, the arrival of immigrants requires us to maximise universal barrier measures, in particular to avoid the transmission of pathogenic viruses not recognised by our immune system. Detection of some of these viruses in saliva, such as Ebola virus or Zika virus represent a new challenge for prevention of human to human transmission. Efforts are being made regarding the development of strategies for virus detection _including polymerase chain reaction-based methods, paper-based synthetic gene networks, immunoassays, magnetic nanoparticles-based assays or liposome-based detection assays. However, there is still a need to search for and improve upon more sensitive and specific detection methods for these challenging viruses. Substantial numbers oral viruses are shared amongst genetically unrelated, cohabitating individuals; most of these viruses are bacteriophages and their distribution over time within households indicates that they are frequently transmitted between the microbiomes of household contacts.",
