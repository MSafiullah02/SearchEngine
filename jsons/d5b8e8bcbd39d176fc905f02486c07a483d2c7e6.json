To the Editor: Disclosure of cancer diagnosis and treatment options is critical for people with cancer and physicians. An information strategy customized to patient preferences may improve treatment adherence, coping strategies, and quality of life at the terminal stage. 1 Older adults seem to wish to know their diagnosis 2 and perceive this information to be important, whereas physicians and families view full disclosure with some reluctance. 3, 4 The objective of the current study was to assess what older adults with cancer know about their diagnosis and treatment and to identify factors associated with the completeness of this information. This was a cross-sectional analysis of the prospective Elderly CAncer Patient (ELCAPA) cohort 5 survey of individuals aged 70 and older with as-yet untreated malignancy between 2007 and 2012. Individuals were referred to geriatric oncology clinics in teaching hospitals near Paris, France. Each participant had received information during a dedicated visit with the oncologist. The endpoint was the completeness of self-reported information about cancer diagnosis and treatment, assessed by a geriatrician. Complete information was defined as correct information about diagnosis and planned treatment, partial information as correct information about either of these points, and no information as no or incorrect information about both points. Demographic, tumorrelated, and geriatric characteristics were recorded prospectively at baseline. Planned cancer treatments were categorized as curative, palliative, or exclusive supportive care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 619, "end": 620, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 795, "end": 797, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 798, "end": 799, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "VIRUS ETIOLOGY OF AIRWAY ILLNESS IN ELDERLY ADULTS"}, {"text": "There were 615 patients with a median age of 80; 52% were men, 38% were inpatients, 52% had metastases, and 42% had a Performance Status (PS) of 2 or greater.
