However, little is known about the molecular basis of PLpro cleavage site sequence recognition, nor the significance for the existence of two PLpro domains, which may or may not exhibit overlapping target site selectivities.21, 33 The cleavage site sequence specificity is limited to a preference for small residues (Gly, Ala) in the P1 and P2 positions for most but not all coronaviral PLpros.20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37 For a structural analysis of PLpros, Herold and colleagues39 built a homology model for the PL1pro domain of HCoV\u2010229E based on the papain structure. The authors modeled an additional \u223c50\u2010residue sequence, which connects the amino\u2010 and carboxy\u2010terminal subdomains of the putative papain fold, as a Zn\u2010ribbon. Indeed, the recombinant PL1pro domain binds equimolar amounts of zinc, and mutation of the predicted zinc\u2010binding motif abolished catalytic activity.39 Recently, we have identified a structural relationship40 between the SCoV PLpro and the catalytic core domain of the papain\u2010like herpesvirus\u2010associated ubiquitin\u2010specific protease (HAUSP), also known as USP7, of the C19 family of ubiquitin\u2010specific proteases (USPs).26 Instead of a classical Zn\u2010ribbon, as proposed for the PLpros by Herold and coworkers,39 HAUSP contains a circularly permuted Zn\u2010ribbon\u2010like domain inserted between the two subdomains of the papain fold.41 We further recognized40 that the binding site complementarity of HAUSP to the C\u2010terminal ubiquitin sequence LRGG matches the narrow specificity profile (LXGG) of SCoV PLpro.22, 25, 27\n",

Despite what their names seem to imply, PL1pro and PL2pro do not represent distinctive subgroups of the coronaviral papain\u2010like enzymes. Indeed, it has not been possible so far to cluster the PL1pro and PL2pro domains into specific groups based on clear functional comparisons. Our analysis reveals a novel classification of all currently known coronaviral PLpros, which is based on their binding\u2010site characteristics. This classification is further used for an independent evaluation of the current annotation of coronaviral PLpro cleavage sites from public databases.",

First, the homology modeling program COMPOSER50 in SYBYL was employed in order to fit various regions of the SCoV PLpro sequence onto the 2.3 \u00c5\u2010resolution crystal structure of the core catalytic domain of HAUSP complexed with ubiquitin aldehyde (PDB code 1NBF),51 and onto the 1.9 \u00c5\u2010resolution crystal structure of FMDV Lpro (1QMY),52 following the sequence alignment shown in Figure 1. Based on sequence similarities, deletions and/or insertions, and the disposition of secondary structure elements, the following sequence\u2010to\u2010template assignment was adopted: (a) the SCoV PLpro segments K1632\u2013E1701, F1798\u2013E1803, and T1814\u2013P1839 were taken from FMDV Lpro segments E30\u2013E96, F137\u2013F142, and V150\u2013D176, respectively, largely covering the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal subdomains; (b) the SCoV PLpro segments L1702\u2013T1797, Y1804\u2013Y1813, and V1840\u2013E1847 were taken from HAUSP segments Q293\u2013E429, H456\u2013Y465, and A513\u2013R520, respectively.

Loops in the SCoV PLpro, corresponding to insertions/deletions or junctions relative to the templates, were constructed by searching protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org) using the PROTEIN LOOPS program in SYBYL. They include the following sequences: P1636\u2013Q1637, E1664\u2013A1671, and R1680\u2013D1682 (in the N\u2010terminal subdomain); A1716\u2013E1719 in the region connecting the N\u2010terminal subdomain to the finger domain of HAUSP; Y1747\u2013L1751 (corresponding to the finger domain of HAUSP); and P1788\u2013A1789, G1796\u2013F1798, and K1819\u2013E1820 (in the C\u2010terminal subdomain).

Several SCoV PLpro side chains were manually repacked to improve van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen atoms were added explicitly, and the polar hydrogens were oriented to favor hydrogen bonding. The ionization state at physiological pH was adopted. The catalytic histidine was treated as neutral due to the covalent adduct formation at the catalytic cysteine. Accordingly, a hydroxyl group was considered instead of an oxyanion in the thiohemiacetal group.

Relative to the SCoV PLpro protease domain (i.e., excluding the Zn\u2010ribbon domain), the larger protease domain of HAUSP has two additional \u03b1\u2010helices in the N\u2010terminal subdomain and three additional \u03b2\u2010strands in the C\u2010terminal subdomain, together with longer intervening loops.

However, the residues predicted to shape the substrate\u2010binding subsites S1 through S4 in SCoV PLpro (described in more detail in the following section) clearly resemble the HAUSP\u2010binding site that accommodates the ubiquitin C\u2010terminal sequence LRGG.51 Among the several sizable differences, which led to the prediction of a less\u2010elaborated structure of SCoV PLpro compared to HAUSP, we noted a shorter loop after the first \u03b2\u2010strand of the C\u2010terminal subdomain in the former protease.

One major difference from the R\u2010group of coronaviral PLpros is seen in the putative S2 subsites of these enzymes. Here, Y1813 and Y1804 are replaced by smaller residues, namely, Ser and Cys, respectively. As in papain and related cathepsins, this opens the S2 pocket for the recognition of bulkier P2 side chains (Fig. 5). Together with the replacement of D1704 by Tyr (another papain\u2010like substitution), this also eliminates three hydrogen bonds to the substrate P3\u2010P4 main chain as modeled for SCoV PLpro. Replacement of G1811 and G1806, which are both conserved in the R\u2010group coronaviral PLpros, with larger residues may affect the conformation and flexibility of the substrate\u2010covering loop (loop Y1804\u2013Y1813, SCoV PLpro numbering). Interestingly, changes in the size of the S2 pocket also impact the relative location of other subsites: the S4 subsite of R\u2010group coronaviral PLpros effectively forms the base of the S2 subsite in the O\u2010group. For example, residues encompassing positions T1841 and P1788, which putatively contribute to the P4 recognition in SCoV PLpro, might actually impact P2 recognition in MHV PL1pro. The extent of the steric hindrance at the S1 subsite in the SCoV PLpro model yet differs from papain. Although the papain\u2010characteristic Gly replaces the bulkier L1702, a non\u2010Gly residue is still present at the N1649 position, which may nevertheless suffice in blocking accommodation of large P1 side chains, as shown by mutation of the corresponding Gly27 in cathepsin B.58 Owing to the open nature primarily at the S2 subsite but also at the S1 subsite, we termed the second group of coronaviral PLpros the O\u2010group. The presence of hydrophobic residues at the putative oxyanion hole position is another interesting feature of O\u2010group coronaviral PLpros, contrasting with the hydrogen\u2010bond\u2010capable oxyanion\u2010stabilizing residues found in the R\u2010group (Gln, Trp, or Thr), as well as in HAUSP and other USPs, FMDV Lpro, papain, and related cathepsins (Asn or Gln).",

For MHV PL1pro, these studies revealed a stringent requirement for Gly in P1 and a preference for Arg at the P2 position, where several substitutions, including Gly, precluded PL1pro cleavage.34, 35, 36 In contrast, the presence of Gly at both P1 and P2 is critical for recognition and processing of the nsp3\u2010nsp4 cleavage site by MHV PL2pro.23 Liu and colleagues20, 38 investigated the specificity of IBV PLpro by site\u2010directed mutagenesis at the p41 and p87 cleavage sites, which are equivalent to the nsp3\u2010nsp4 and nsp2\u2010nsp3 sites, respectively, of the other coronavirus replicase polyproteins.21 These two highly conserved cleavage sites feature Lys, Ala, and Gly at P3, P2, and P1, respectively.

It is interesting to note that MHV PL1pro (O\u2010group) and MHV PL2pro (R\u2010group), in addition to their different substrate specificities, also display distinct behaviors toward E\u201064d, a membrane\u2010permeable derivative of the cysteine protease\u2010specific irreversible epoxysuccinyl inhibitor E\u201064.

Specifically, the majority of annotated processing sites for R\u2010group PLpros feature small residues (Gly, Ala) in P1 and P2, which is in agreement with the restricted nature of the binding sites of the processing PLpros. For PEDV, however, there are different predictions in the SwissProt and GenBank databases for the nsp1\u2010nsp2 cleavage sites. Our classification is consistent with the GenBank annotation. In the case of TGEV, the annotated nsp1\u2010nsp2 and nsp3\u2010nsp4 PLpro\u2010mediated cleavage sites contain larger P2 residues, i.e., Arg (according to SwissProt) or Thr (according to GenBank) in the nsp1\u2010nsp2 cleavage site, and Ser for nsp3\u2010nsp4. Given the restricted S1 and S2 binding subsites predicted for both PL1pro and PL2pro of TGEV, we revised the nsp1\u2010nsp2 cleavage site annotation to A111\u2010I112, one residue downstream of the SwissProt annotation, thus placing Ala and Gly in the P1 and P2 positions, respectively. The nsp3\u2010nsp4 cleavage site of TGEV may also be subject to revision. Processing may rather occur between S2389 and G2390, which is also one residue downstream to the current annotation. Although this reannotation positions Ser instead of Gly in P1, it substitutes Ser for Gly in the more restricted S2 subsite and displaces Pro from P4 to P5. In our model of SCoV PLpro, D1704, which is fully conserved in the R\u2010group PLpros (Fig. 4), forms a hydrogen bond to the P4 main\u2010chain NH group (Fig. 3). However, this would be incompatible with the presence of a P4 Pro as predicted by the current database annotation. Another alternative cleavage site, in our opinion less favorable, would be between G2390 and F2391, two residues downstream to the current annotation, which although positions Pro in P6 and Gly in P1, introduces Ser in the more restricted S2 subsite and places the bulky hydrophobic Phe in P1\u2032 (unique among coronaviral PLpro cleavage sites).",

The putative representation of PLpros, whether R\u2010 or O\u2010type, in the primordial nsp3, and their evolution in the contemporary lineages of coronaviruses,64 remains speculative. It cannot be ruled out that the involvement of PLpros in processes other than polyprotein processing has played a part in the diversification of their structural relationships, and influenced the co\u2010evolution of their cleavage sites. Interestingly, the O\u2010type signature along with its corresponding cleavage site sequences appears to be less diverse (Figs. 4 and 6), maybe owing to a more recent evolutionary origin than for the R\u2010type signature. Our results, however, suggest that a conversion of PLpro specificity in either direction would have been associated with major structural active site rearrangements, requiring considerable evolutionary pressure.",

These enzymes are the PL2pros from HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010HKU1, BCoV, and MHV (Fig. 6). In order to comment on the ability of other R\u2010group PLpros to deubiquitinate proteins, further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to elucidate whether those coronaviral PLpros can accommodate in their binding sites a P4 Leu and a P3 Arg, the residues found in ubiquitin. Owing to the requirement for a bulky P2 residue34 and the predicted spacious S2 subsite (Fig. 5), it is unlikely that the O\u2010group PLpros will possess deubiquitinating activity. An interesting observation is that, for those coronaviruses where a P4 Leu residue is found at the replicase cleavage site by an R\u2010group PLpro, the coronavirus also has an O\u2010group PLpro (i.e., HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010HKU1, BCoV, and MHV). The R\u2010group enzyme performs a single cleavage of the polyprotein at nsp3\u2010nsp4, whereas the O\u2010group enzyme cleaves at nsp1\u2010nsp2 and nsp2\u2010nsp3. The SARS coronavirus is an exception, because it has an R\u2010group PLpro that processes at sites containing Leu in the P4 position, but it lacks an O\u2010group PLpro. In the coronaviruses where there is no Leu in the P4 of the processing site, there are two R\u2010group enzymes, or in the case of IBV, only one R\u2010group PLpro.",

            "text": "Owing to the wealth of protein 3D structural data coupled with the constant improvement of fold recognition algorithms, a significant structural relationship could be detected between the catalytic core domains of SCoV PLpro and HAUSP cysteine proteases, both featuring a circularly permuted Zn\u2010ribbon domain inserted in the middle of a papain\u2010like fold. One can thus reconsider the current classification of coronaviral PLpros and USPs into families C16 and C19, respectively, in the MEROPS peptidase database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk).26 Comparative sequence analysis data superimposed onto a binding site structural framework show that coronaviral PLpros can be classified into two groups according to their binding site architectures. One group, termed R and present in all currently known coronaviruses, is predicted to feature sterically restricted S1 and S2 substrate\u2010binding subsites and a P1\u2010P4\u2010substrate\u2010binding mode characteristic of USPs. The other group, termed O, particularly features an open S2 subsite and a substrate\u2010binding mode that resembles more papain and related cathepsins. This classification, which differs in part from those extracted from the phylogenetic trees of coronaviral replicases and PLpro domains, is a first step toward the understanding of the molecular basis for the processing specificity and inhibition selectivity data that has become available for several members of the family. For the remaining coronaviral PLpros, the R/O classification can be used to critically evaluate and, in a few instances, to revise the publicly available annotations of polyprotein cleavage sites. The ubiquitous presence of the R\u2010group binding site in all coronaviruses can be advantageously exploited to design PLpro inhibitors with a wide\u2010spectrum efficacy against all coronaviruses. Certainly, experimental structure determinations, at least for one family member, will be valuable for a more reliable identification of those structural details that may be required to overcome the predicted inhibitory cross\u2010reactivity with host enzymes, particularly with the USPs.",
