Many microorganisms have been associated with bronchiectasis, both as a complication of the anatomic abnormalities and possibly as a cause of the structural disease as well [2, 3] . Diverse polymicrobial communities are present in the airways of patients with bronchiectasis [4] . Studies using standard microbiologic culture techniques have demonstrated the presence of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens in the lungs of bronchiectasis patients both when the patient is clinically stable and when there is an exacerbation of disease [2, 5] . Newer molecular techniques have broadened our understanding of the microbiome in bronchiectasis patients [4, 6] . Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been repeatedly shown to be a problematic pathogen in patients with bronchiectasis and is associated with a worse prognosis [7, 8] . Multiple epidemiologic reports have shown that approximately 20-35% of patients worldwide with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa [2, 9, 10] . Several antibiotic trials have been published where the main target of therapy is Pseudomonas aeruginosa [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . (See Chap. 11 for a full review of P. aeruginosa infections associated with bronchiectasis.) Another problematic group of pathogens, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), is a common infecting organism in bronchiectasis, particularly in the United States and in parts of Asia [2, 18] . NTM infection is fully discussed in Chap. 13 . In this chapter, we will review the role of bacterial pathogens other than P. aeruginosa and the impact of fungal and viral infections in bronchiectasis patients.

Age and overall severity of disease have been evaluated as possible markers for specific infections but are not sufficiently specific to pinpoint the infecting organism. In one series from Israel, younger patients (less than or equal to 64 years) with bronchiectasis were shown to be more likely infected with Haemophilus and older patients with Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae [20] , but this has not been seen in other large patient cohorts. Although patients with more severe disease (based on severity scores) are more likely to have chronic Pseudomonas infection, other pathogens may be present and be responsible for the patient's symptoms. Radiographic patterns of disease are also not sufficiently specific for identifying the infecting organisms. Although \"tree-in-bud\" nodularity is frequently thought to be diagnostic of NTM infections, recent studies have shown that the \"tree-in-bud\" finding simply represents endobronchial inflammation not specific to a particular organism [21, 22] . Sputum color charts developed in an attempt to correlate degree of sputum purulence with specific organisms have not been reliable in predicting culture results [23, 24] . Hence, it is imperative that sputum cultures be performed in all bronchiectasis patients on a regular basis in order to target treatments and assess prognosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1134, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1138, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1306, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Comments"}, {"text": "The most common bacterial organism reported in many epidemiologic series is Haemophilus influenzae. Thirty percent or more of patients with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with H. influenzae [9, 10, 19] . As with all bronchiectasis patients, the cornerstone of therapy for patients infected with this organism is airway clearance by various modalities, including mechanical, pharmacologic, and exercise [25] [26] [27] . When patients infected with H. influenzae have exacerbations, there are multiple oral antibiotics that can be used to treat the flares of infection. Institutional specific susceptibility patterns and patient tolerance should dictate the specifics of therapy. Maintenance inhaled antibiotics are generally not recommended for patients who are chronically infected with H. influenzae. One study of long-term inhaled (7) gentamicin, which included a few patients with chronic H. influenzae infection, did show benefit and reasonably good tolerance [13] , but studies that used maintenance aztreonam for inhalation had negative results [15] . Chronic macrolide therapy may be appropriate for frequent exacerbators as long as there is appropriate attention for potential adverse effects [28] . (See Chap. 16 for a full review of macrolide therapy.) Other Gram-negative organisms that are occasionally isolated from patients with bronchiectasis include Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Serratia marcescens, and Escherichia coli. Routine culturing of respiratory secretions is necessary in order to track the specific infecting organism in a particular patient. It is vital to target antibiotic therapy at that organism and to keep abreast of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern, which may change over time. There is insufficient data and no consensus on using maintenance antibiotics in patients infected with the above Gram-negative organisms. Expert opinion suggests that such therapy (by inhalation and targeted to the organism) may be useful in specific patients who have frequent exacerbations (greater than 2-3 per year that require systemic therapy) and/or in patients who have bothersome daily cough with a large volume of secretions. There is no specific guidance available regarding possible \"eradication\" therapy for Gram-negative infections with organisms other than Pseudomonas.

Treatment of patients with these infections includes the usual airway clearance modalities and targeted antibiotic treatment. There are no data available for maintenance inhaled antibiotics for patients chronically infected with Grampositive organisms. As with Gram-negative infections, there may be a role for targeted antimicrobial suppressant therapy for patients with frequent exacerbations and/or significant and bothersome day-to-day symptoms.

Our understanding of the wide spectrum of bacteria that infect these patients, including NTM, is growing. We know less about the impact of fungal and viral pathogens on the bronchiectatic lung. The impact of coinfection with multiple organisms is also poorly understood, especially with regard to which organism to target with specific antibiotic treatment. Current clinically available microbiologic techniques do not provide a full understanding of the microbiologic diversity within the lungs of bronchiectasis patients. We may learn more from ongoing research into the lung microbiome as well as the impact of antimicrobial therapies on the balance of organisms within that microbiome. At the present time, it is imperative for clinicians to carefully monitor the microbiologic results of patients with bronchiectasis in order to provide optimal and judicious antibiotic treatments as well as to help with assessing the prognosis of the individual patient. The frequency of monitoring for each type of pathogen (routine bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal) has not been clearly spelled out in existing guidelines. How sputum samples are handled (collection and processing) also varies from region to region and from laboratory to laboratory. In patients with established bronchiectasis, careful microbiologic surveillance in the stable and exacerbated states is needed. Clinicians need to be aware of local microbiologic data and need to track the results in individual patients. Close interaction with the local microbiology laboratory may also improve antibiotic stewardship for patients with bronchiectasis. Clinicians should strongly consider establishing a protocol for obtaining sputum cultures at regular intervals in their bronchiectasis patients based upon local infection patterns and overall experience with their patients. It is clear that routine bacterial and mycobacterial surveillance is needed; routine fungal cultures may or may not be of value and viral cultures are probably most worthwhile at times of exacerbation.
