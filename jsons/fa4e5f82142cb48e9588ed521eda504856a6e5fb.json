Yet, the geographic structure of social networks and interactions is usually hard to measure on a national or global scale. In Bailey et al. (2018b) , we showed how data from online social networking services can be used to measure and understand the geographic structure of social networks. We introduced a new data set, the Social Connectedness Index, which captures the relative probability that individuals across two regions are connected through a friendship link on Facebook, a global online social network. At the time, we suggested that such a measure of the geographic structure of social networks may be helpful to epidemiologists hoping to forecast the spread of communicable diseases. The idea was that two regions connected through many friendship links are likely to see more physical interactions between their residents, providing increased opportunities for the spread of communicable diseases.",

Westchester County includes New Rochelle, a community that had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern United States (NPR, March 10, 2020). As of March 20th, the county had over 9,300 cases, second only to nearby New York City. Additionally, a number of articles have reported wealthy residents from Westchester and the New York area fleeing to other parts of the U.S. (New York Times, March 25, 2020), providing a vector that could potentially spread the disease across the country. Social connections to Westchester may thus provide particularly important information for tracking the spread of COVID-19, especially if individuals' travel patterns follow their social networks, as suggested by Bailey et al. (2019b Bailey et al. ( , 2020b . Lodi is an Italian province of around 230,000 inhabitants in the heavily impacted region of Lombardy.

Panel (b) shows the distribution of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents across U.S. counties, again with darker colors corresponding to higher COVID-19 prevalence. These maps show a number of similarities. Perhaps most notably, coastal regions and urban centers appear to have both high levels of connectedness to Westchester and larger numbers of COVID-19 cases per resident. But a number of more subtle patterns emerge as well. Both measures are high in the communities along the coasts of Florida (in particular along the southeastern coast, near Miami), in western and central Colorado (in particular in areas with ski resorts), and in the upper northeast. These areas are all popular vacation destinations and second home locations for many well-heeled residents of Westchester. Indeed, the governors of Florida and Rhode Island have both publicly lamented the number of New York area residents fleeing to their states and spreading COVID-19 (Tampa Bay Times, March 23, 2020; Time, March 28, 2020). By contrast, many areas that are geographically closer but less socially connected to Westchester, such as in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have fewer confirmed COVID-19 cases. There are also a number of patterns of COVID-19 prevalence that connectedness to Westchester alone cannot explain. Areas surrounding King County, WA (Seattle), for example, have relatively low levels of connectedness to Westchester, but were an independent early hotspot of COVID-19. Some states in the southern U.S. where residents were slower to limit travel also have higher case densities than would be predicted purely by social connectedness to Westchester (New York Times, April 2, 2020).",

As a result, including social connectedness might not improve predictive power for models that already control for some of these other variables. In Panel (d), we therefore present a binscatter plot of the relationship between social connectedness to Westchester County and COVID-19 cases that controls for a number of these possible confounding variables (in addition to excluding nearby counties).

We chose the current set of control variables to highlight that the Social Connectedness Index has such predictive power over and above a number of variables on which data is already easily available, and that may partially proxy for social connections in models of communicable disease spread. The observed increase in predictive power thus suggests that the Social Connectedness Index might serve as a valuable measure above some existing proxies for social interactions. 5 Figure 2 explores the analogous relationships for Lodi province in Italy. The provinces with highest COVID-19 case densities and connectedness to Lodi are in the surrounding Lombardy region, as well as the nearby Piemonte and Veneto regions. There are also relatively high levels of both connectedness to Lodi and COVID-19 cases in Rimini, a popular tourist destination along the Adriatic sea. A number of provinces in southern Italy send workers and students to the industrial Lombardy region, and therefore have strong social ties to that region. While some of these areas have seen a number of COVID-19 cases, they are not disproportionally larger, perhaps reflecting the efforts of Italian authorities to restrict the movement of individuals (LA Times, March 8, 2020). Panels (c) and (d) repeat the binscatter exercise from Figure 1 . We exclude provinces within 50 kilometers. In Panel (d) we control for geographic distance using 20 dummies for the quantile of the distance from each province to Lodi, as well as GDP per inhabitant and population density. Again we find that the Social Connectedness Index appears to have predictive power above these other measures that might commonly be used to proxy for social interactions. Quantitatively, a doubling of SCI corresponds to an increase of 16.6 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents after controlling for these relevant factors. The incremental R-Squared of including social connectedness to Lodi over the other control variables is 0.057.",

Indeed, in Bailey et al. (2018b) , we explicitly proposed the modeling of communicable diseases as a potentially fruitful direction for others to pursue, without attempting any such modeling ourselves. However, these are not normal times, and we have spent much of the last few years exploring these data on the geographic structure of social networks. In the process, we have found them to be extremely useful for understanding a large number of social and economic relationships such as trade patterns, patent citations, and travel flows. Given the urgency of the current global health crisis, we hope that our expertise in measuring social networks can therefore contribute to the worldwide interdisciplinary research effort to better understand COVID-19.",

For example, the availability of zip-code level data on social connectedness in the United States as well as similar data for many countries around the world will allow for more detailed modeling as COVID-19 case data becomes available at that level of geographic disaggregation. We would be excited to work with any interested team to help them get the most out of the Social Connectedness Index data.",

Panel (b) shows the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by Italian province on March 30th, 2020. Panels (c) and (d) show binscatter plots with provinces more than 50 kliometers from Lodi as the unit of observation. To generate the plot in Panel (c) we group log(SCI) into 30 equal-sized bins and plot the average against the corresponding average case density. Panel (d) is constructed in a smaller manner. However, we first regress log(SCI) and cases per 10,000 residents on a set of control variables and plot the residualized values on each axis. Red lines show quadratic fit regressions. The controls for Panel (d) are 20 dummies for the quantile of the province distance to Lodi; GDP per inhabitant; and population density.",
