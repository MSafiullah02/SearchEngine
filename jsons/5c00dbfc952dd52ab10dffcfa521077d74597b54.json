            "text": "Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), named coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, is associated with an ongoing worldwide outbreak of atypical and severe pneumonia. 1 SARS-CoV-2 uses human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cellular entry point. 1 ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelia, lung parenchyma, vascular endothelium, heart, kidneys, and small intestine 2 , which explains most of COVID-19 symptoms. ACE2 is also present in glial cells and neurons of mammalian brains, especially in brainstem nuclei involved in cardio-respiratory function. 2 SARS-CoV-2 is therefore considered to have potential neuro-invasiveness that might lead to acute brain disorders or contribute to respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. 3 SARS-CoV-2 might enter the central nervous system (CNS) through hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde route via, e.g., olfactory bulbs or medullary neurons. 3 The anosmia frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 4 supports the neural retrograde hypothesis. The neuro-invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 is also supported by case reports of meningo-encephalitis, 5 intracerebral hemorrhage, 6 and secondary acute necrotizing encephalopathy 7 associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Central neurological symptoms (e.g., headache, stroke, impaired consciousness) are also observed in 25% of COVID-19 patients. 8 Still, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are scarce in COVID-19 patients due to difficulties to obtain such examination in infected unstable patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. 8 This prospective, monocentric, postmortem brain MRI case series investigated the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities in non-survivors of COVID-19 in a brain virtopsy framework performed early (\u226424h) after death.
