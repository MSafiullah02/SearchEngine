            "text": "The spreading of epidemics is currently one of the hottest topics in the field of complex networks, and a great deal of significant progress has been achieved so far, including the infinitesimal threshold [1\u20136], the reaction-diffusion model [7\u201310], flow-driven epidemics [11\u201315], objective spreading [16,17], temporal and/or multilayered networks [18\u201327], and other aspects [28\u201336]; see Refs. [37\u201339] for details. A common point in all these contributions is that their infectious rate \u03b2 remains constant during an evolutionary process, i.e., \u03b2 will not change for the whole evolutionary process from an initial infected seed to the final stationary state. It is well known at present that there is a critical \u03b2c, although it may be different for different cases. In the thermodynamic limit, the infected fraction will be zero when \u03b2<\u03b2c, and it will become nonzero at \u03b2=\u03b2c. After the critical point \u03b2c, the infected fraction will gradually increase with a further increase of \u03b2. Thus, a key question for all these cases is how to determine \u03b2c. To figure out the answer, a bifurcation diagram of \u03b2 is usually calculated by using the same or similar initial conditions for each \u03b2, i.e., one or a few initial infected seeds. To be specific, for each \u03b2 in the bifurcation diagram we let the system evolve until it attains its stationary state, and then we record the stabilized infectious density [37]. Then, we turn to a new \u03b2 and perform the same process. Thus, the obtained bifurcation diagram of \u03b2 describes how the stabilized infectious density depends on the parameter \u03b2. In this sense, we are concerned with how an epidemic breaks out, i.e., the growing phase where \u03b2 changes from \u03b2<\u03b2c to \u03b2>\u03b2c.",

That is, there is a recovering phase with gradually decreasing \u03b2, and a growing phase with gradually increasing \u03b2. This recovering phase is distinctive from the recovery process at the individual level with fixed \u03b2. For example, in the traditional SIS model, \u03b2 will remain unchanged when the infected individuals recover to susceptible status. Additionally, in the SIR model, \u03b2 will also remain unchanged in the evolutionary process in which the infected fraction will first gradually increase to its maximum and then decrease until zero. A primary purpose of studying epidemic spreading is to understand it and then to control or eradicate it. For the same reason, it is also necessary to understand the recovery phase, but little attention has been paid to this subject so far.",

To reflect this influence, Ref. [40] assumed that \u03b2 depends sinusoidally on time t, and Ref. [45] assumed that \u03b2 depends on the infected density. Based on these assumptions, an interesting finding is that it is possible for the transition from \u03b2<\u03b2c to \u03b2>\u03b2c to be a first-order phase transition with hysteresis [44,45], in contrast to the second-order transition observed in all the cases of constant \u03b2 [37\u201339].",

We find that (i) the growing and recovering phases do not overlap but take different paths, forming a hysteresis loop (see Fig. 2 as an example), and (ii) there is no jumping behavior in the hysteresis loop, indicating that the hysteresis is not a first-order but rather a second-order transition. To reveal the underlying mechanism of this new hysteresis loop, we present an epidemic model that incorporates two characteristic features of real data. The first one is the influence of seasonal variation. A seasonal epidemic spreading generally lasts for a few months, i.e., beginning from a healthy state, then gradually developing into an outbreak, and finally recovering to the healthy state again. In this process, the weather and environment will undergo an approximately periodic change, implying that \u03b2 will increase accordingly from zero to its maximum \u03b2e and then decrease to zero again. The second feature is the succession of status during the evolutionary process of epidemic spreading, indicating that the system's parameters are adiabatically changed.",

These models have been adequate in explaining traditional epidemics. However, for modern epidemics, much evidence has shown that they spread on complex networks. For example, the data on gonorrhoea told us that the epidemic spreading paths are of network topology [49]. It has been widely confirmed in recent years that the topology of a network plays an important role in epidemic spreading [37]. Accordingly, the developed models and theories can be used in practical applications. For example, the original seeds of SARS can be successfully tracked by a small fraction of epidemic data [50]. In this sense, we will take here a typical complex network as the infrastructure for an epidemic to spread.",

From these we see that each time series consists of a small amplitude background with occasionally large bursts, implying that an epidemic outbreak is unlikely to occur unless some necessary conditions, such as the match of seasonal weather, humidity, and sunlight, are satisfied. We also see from Figs. 1(a)\u20131(c) that each epidemic outbreak lasts a relatively long time, i.e., from one to a few months, indicating the mark of a season. On the other hand, we have to point out that each time series in Fig. 1 is not from one or a few initial seeds in the same initial stage, rather each time series is a sum from different initial seeds at different initial stages. For example, the data in Fig. 1(a) were collected by the Hong Kong Department of Health from a sentinel surveillance system with 50 general practitioners [46], i.e., a summation of 50 subtime series. In this sense, we conclude that the data reflect in fact the match between epidemic spreading and seasonal environment. A better match implies a better environment for epidemic spreading. That is, we may assume that the degree of match is closely related to the value of \u03b2. Therefore, a burst (or an epidemic outbreak) in Fig. 1 can be modeled by a change of \u03b2 from \u03b2<\u03b2c to \u03b2>\u03b2c.\n",

This is in contrast to most of the previous studies in which the initial conditions for each \u03b2 are always chosen randomly. To reflect the seasonal influence, we may assume that the growing phase corresponds to an adiabatic increase of \u03b2. For the same reason, we may assume that the recovering phase corresponds to an adiabatic decrease of \u03b2. (ii) Each burst usually lasts several weeks or months, indicating the time dependence of \u03b2 on a large scale. This is also in contrast to most of the previous studies, where \u03b2 is allowed to change only after the transient process. A key problem is how \u03b2 depends on the time t. We notice from our observation that we generally have a few continuously sunny or rainy days in a season, indicating that \u03b2 can be approximately considered as a constant in this short period of time, although \u03b2 changes with t on a larger scale. To reflect this feature of real data, we let T be a step change, i.e., \u03b2 will be updated to a new value \u03b2+\u0394\u03b2 once the system has stayed at the current \u03b2 for a time period T, and it can be expressed as\n(1)\u03b2(t+1)=\u03b2(t)ift\u2260nT,n=1,2,\u22ef,\u03b2(t+1)=\u03b2(t)\u00b1\u0394\u03b2ift=nT,n=1,2,\u22ef.",

Then, we let the system freely run a period of time T where a susceptible individual will become infected with probability \u03b2 if he/she is connected to an infected neighbor, and an infected one will recover to susceptible again with probability \u03bc [37]. When there are more than one infected neighbors, a susceptible individual will become infected with probability 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)kinf, where kinf is the number of its infected neighbors. After a time period of T, we let \u03b2 have an increase as in Eq. (1), but we keep the individual states unchanged. We repeat this process until \u03b2 reaches its maximum \u03b2e. After that, we simulate the recovering phase by letting \u03b2(t+1)=\u03b2e\u2212\u0394\u03b2 but we let the individual states remain. Then, we let the system run as a traditional SIS model.

Considering that the hysteresis loop exists in different real data of Fig. 1, it is necessary to reproduce it in other epidemic models. For this purpose, we take another classical epidemic model, i.e., the SIR model, as an example. To make the SIR model suitable for the case of recurrent epidemics, we extend it to the susceptible-infected-refractory-susceptible (SIRS) model [37], where an infectious will become a refractory with probability \u03bc, a refractory will recover to susceptible again with probability \u03b4, and the other parts will remain the same as in the SIS model. We let \u03bc=0.2 and \u03b4=0.5, and we perform the same simulations as in the SIS model. We find that there is also a hysteresis loop in this SIRS model. Figure 3(c) shows the results, where the curves with squares, circles, up triangles, and down triangles represent the cases of T=1, 2, 5, and 1000, respectively. Comparing Fig. 3(c) with Fig. 3(a), we see that they are similar to each other, confirming the universality of the hysteresis loop in both the SIS and SIRS models.

            "text": "Up to now, the considered growing and recovering phases have been assumed to be separated by the maximum \u03c1I at \u03b2m. An interesting question would be whether there is another way to explain the hysteresis loop in Fig. 2(b). As we mentioned before, \u03b2 may vary from day to day in the real data. Because of the uncertain environment, \u03b2 may not go to \u03b2m before starting the recovering phase. Once this happens, do we still have the hysteresis loop? To answer this question, we let \u03b2r be the turning point to separate the growing and recovering phases. That is, we let \u03b2 increase adiabatically from \u03b2=0 to \u03b2r and then we let it decrease adiabatically. We first consider the case of the SIS model. Figure 4 shows the numerical simulations, where (a)\u2013(d) represent the cases of T=1, 2, 5, and 10, respectively, and the curves with squares, circles, up triangles, and down triangles in each panel represent the cases of \u03b2r=0.3, 0.2, 0.15, and 0.1, respectively. From Fig. 4(a), we see that the case of \u03b2r=0.3 is similar to Fig. 3(a), implying that this \u03b2r is larger than the \u03b2m of T=1. However, the other three cases of Fig. 4(a) belong to the case of \u03b2r<\u03b2m, and they have different behaviors from Fig. 3(a), where their \u03c1I do not reach the maximum at \u03b2r but rather during the recovering phase. That is, the recovering phase is not monotonously decreasing but has a bell shape, indicating a delay effect on the appearance of the maximum \u03c1I. This delay effect can be understood as follows. When \u03b2 is decreased to a value of \u03b2<\u03b2r but still satisfies \u03b2>\u03b2c, the epidemic will keep growing until \u03b2\u2264\u03b2c. The delay effect is common in all four panels of Fig. 4, indicating that it is general for \u03b2r<\u03b2m. On the other hand, we notice that the three curves with \u03b2r=0.2, 0.15, and 0.1 in Fig. 4(a) keep rising from Fig. 4(b) to Fig. 4(d) and gradually become the normal hysteresis loops. This is because \u03b2m decreases with the increase of T [see the insets of Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)] and thus \u03b2r gradually changes from \u03b2r<\u03b2m to \u03b2r>\u03b2m when T changes from Fig. 4(a) to Fig. 4(d).\n",

            "text": "To gain a deeper insight into the origin of the hysteresis loop in recurrent epidemics, we perform a brief theoretical analysis here by using the SIS model as an example. As the random ER network can be considered homogeneous [37], we take the framework of mean-field theory. For convenience, we divide the evolution time t into segments T,2T,\u22ef,nT,\u22ef. Let \u03b2(nT) represent the value of \u03b2 at time t=nT. For an adiabatic process, we have \u03b2[(n+1)T]=\u03b2(nT)\u00b1\u0394\u03b2, with \u0394\u03b2 being the increment, and the \u201c\u00b1\u201d representing the growing and recovering phases, respectively. The evolution of \u03c1I(t) during the segment nT\u2192(n+1)T can be described by the following mean-field equation:\n(2)\u03c1I\u02d9=\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232a\u03c1I(1\u2212\u03c1I)\u2212\u03bc\u03c1I,By dividing \u03c1I2 on both sides of Eq. (2), we have\n(3)d1\u03c1Idt=[\u03bc\u2212\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232a]1\u03c1I+\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232a.Letting 1/\u03c1I be a new variable and integrating Eq. (3) for an evolution time T, we obtain its solution as\n(4)\u03c1I[(n+1)T]=1\u2212\u03bc\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232aCe[\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232a\u2212\u03bc]T1+Ce[\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232a\u2212\u03bc]T,where\n(5)C=\u03c1I(nT)1\u2212\u03c1I(nT)\u2212\u03bc/\u03b2(nT)\u2329k\u232aand \u03c1I(nT) is the initial value of \u03c1I for the segment nT\u2192(n+1)T and also the last value of \u03c1I in the segment (n\u22121)T\u2192nT with \u03b2[(n\u22121)T]. This dependence of \u03b2(nT) on time nT is in contrast to previous cases in which \u03b2 is a constant for an evolution. On the other hand, the growing and recovering phases have the same range of varying \u03b2. Do the two phases have the same \u03c1I when they pass the same value of \u03b2? The answer is no, and the reason is as follows. In the growing phase, \u03c1I(nT) is the minimum of \u03c1I in the segment nT\u2192(n+1)T, while in the recovering phase, \u03c1I(nT) is the maximum of \u03c1I in the segment nT\u2192(n+1)T. Therefore, the way to choose \u03c1I(nT) in Eqs. (4) and (5) leads to asymmetric initial conditions for the two phases of growing and recovering in the segment with the same \u03b2, which is how the memory effect occurs, and this is the direct reason why the hysteresis loop is produced. The down triangles and pentagons in Fig. 7 show the solutions of Eq. (4) with \u03bc=0.2, \u2329k\u232a=6, and T=1, where the down triangles represent the case of \u03b2r=0.4>\u03b2m, and the pentagons represent the case of \u03b2r=0.15<\u03b2m. For comparison, we also plot the corresponding numerical results in Fig. 7, where the squares and left triangles represent the cases of \u03b2r=0.4>\u03b2m and \u03b2r=0.15<\u03b2m, respectively. It is easy to see that the numerical simulations and theoretical results are qualitatively consistent.\n",

In fact, this effective degree theory is quite similar to the approach of improved compartmental formalism [55] in which nodes are categorized not only by their state of infectiousness, but also by the state of their neighbors. We also notice that in Ref. [55], the approach works quite well for Poisson networks. This causes us to wonder why the effective degree theory does not perform well at predicting the results of the numerical simulations. To figure out the answer, we apply the effective degree theory to the Poisson networks, and surprisingly it also works well. Thus, we conjecture that the gap between the numerical simulations and the analytical approaches in Fig. 7 comes from the adiabatical feature of evolution. Roughly speaking, all of the theoretical approaches, including both the effective degree theory and the approach in Ref. [55], are based on probability theory, which is good for smooth processes. However, the changing of \u03b2 in an adiabatic way somehow breaks this feature of \u201csmooth\u201d and thus results in the small gap between the theories and simulations in Fig. 7.",

We show that there is a hysteresis loop in real data, and it can be reproduced by incorporating two characteristic features into a general epidemic model, i.e., updating \u03b2 before the system is stabilized and adopting the system's state with its previous \u03b2. Two ways to generate the hysteresis loop are presented: in the first, the growing and recovering phases are separated by a maximum of infected fraction, while in the second, the infected fraction keeps increasing even in the recovering phase. A theoretical analysis shows that the hysteresis loop comes from a memory effect on the adiabatic process with T<Ts, which enhances our understanding of real epidemics.",
