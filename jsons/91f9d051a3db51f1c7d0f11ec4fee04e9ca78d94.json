As cure rates improve, treatmentrelated toxicity, especially infections, accounts for a greater proportion of morbidity and mortality. Pediatric hematology and oncology patients are often highly susceptible to infection. Those with medical devices, such as indwelling central catheters, and those with intermittent or chronic neutropenia are particularly at high risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and respiratory viral infections. In the past, infectious complications of therapy for oncological and hematological disorders were regarded as largely unavoidable. It is now recognized that many, although not all, of the most common infections in this population are preventable.

These units also reported substantial temporary central line use. CLABSI, however, are the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI) affecting pediatric hematology-oncology patients.

Thrombin covering the intravascular portion of the catheter and the biofilm produced by many microbial pathogens promotes the adhesion of pathogens.

These surveillance strategies have also been applied to infections in ambulatory pediatric hematology and oncology patients [4, 6] . Specific criteria for bloodstream infections developed by the CDC Prevention Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (Table 11 .2) distinguish between a CLABSI, an infection occurring in a patient who has had a central line in place for >2 days, and a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), a CLABSI for which specific laboratory testing has identified the central line as the source of the infection [7] . Practically, it is sometimes not possible to implicate or exclude the catheter because the appropriate laboratory test was not feasible (e.g., if the central line is not removed and cultures of the catheter tip, therefore, not possible) or not obtained (e.g., simultaneous blood cultures from both the central line and a peripheral vein for comparison of time to positivity). The simpler definition of CLABSI has, therefore, been used for NHSN surveillance although it is recognized that it is less specific than desirable.

Use of CLABSI as a surveillance definition in these populations, therefore, overestimates the proportion of bloodstream infections that are attributable to central lines and has implications for whether or not these infections may be prevented by traditional approaches or, indeed, if these infections are preventable at all [10] . In 2013, the NHSN introduced a new surveillance definition of \"mucosal injury-associated laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection\" (MBI-LCBI, Table 11 .2).

C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus. Intestinal colonization occurs when infectious spores, which may persist for long periods in the environment, are ingested. Some strains elaborate two homologous exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B,which bind to and damage intestinal epithelial cells and incite strong inflammatory responses [13] . North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) PCR ribotype 027 strains of toxogenic C. difficile, which express more toxin A and B than other strains and an additional binary toxin, emerged in the early 2000s.

The most commonly recognized risk factor for 4.5 Data from the National Healthcare Safety Network, available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/datastat/index.html CDI is antibiotic use; others include antineoplastic chemotherapy, the use of proton pump inhibitors, gastrointestinal surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunocompromising conditions [15] . Adults with cancer and recipients of HSCT are at significantly greater risk of CDI than the general hospital population, with rates ranging from 3.4% to 27% [16] . Disease manifestations range from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis. Complications such as toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, and sepsis are responsible for an estimated fatality rate of up to 15% in adults [12] . Malignancy is also a strong predictor of recurrent CDI. Most children with healthcare-associated CDI have underlying medical comorbidities, with malignancy being the most common. Up to 25% of cases of CDI in hospitalized children occur in those with cancer, a rate tenfold higher than that observed in children without cancer [17, 18] . Boyle reported 17% of pediatric HSCT recipients older than 1 year of age developed CDI within 100 days of transplant (20/10,000 patient days), significantly higher than that the rate observed in adult recipients [19] . Severe and complicated disease appear to be less common in children than adults, but more frequent in children with cancer than those without malignancy [15, 16, 20] . The NHSN defines healthcare-associated CDI as a positive test for toxinproducing C. difficile in an unformed stool specimen and/or gross anatomic or histopathological evidence of pseudomembranous colitis, with disease beginning >3 days after admission to a healthcare facility [21] . This and other clinical and surveillance definitions have significant limitations that may affect estimates of the incidence of CDI in pediatric oncology patients. Over half of young children, especially those <2 years of age, and almost a third of pediatric oncology patients may be asymptomatically colonized by C. difficile, often for long periods of time [22] [23] [24] . Some investigators have suggested that sensitive molecular diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification of toxin A and B genes, are more likely to overestimate the incidence of CDI than older assays because these are more likely to identify the clinically inconsequential carriage of C. difficile [22] . Viruses and other gastrointestinal co-pathogens are also detected in as many as 80% of children, including immunocompromised children with CDI, making it difficult to judge the contribution of each potential pathogen to diarrheal disease [25, 26] . Importantly, however, patients who are colonized with toxogenic C. difficile may still represent a source of environmental shedding and transmission of infectious spores. Judicious use of antimicrobials, infection prevention precautions, and environmental cleaning are the mainstays of CDI prevention in healthcare settings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 193, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 707, "end": 711, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 940, "end": 944, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1660, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1664, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1668, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1952, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2314, "end": 2318, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2323, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2328, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2640, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2881, "end": 2885, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2886, "end": 2889, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clostridium difficileInfection(CDI)"}, {"text": "The NHSN surveillance definition for pneumonia incorporates the results of diagnostic imaging, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory tests [27] .

Reactivation of latent pulmonary or systemic infection, such as cytomegalovirus or tuberculosis, in oncology and transplant patients, including children, may be indistinguishable from VAP. Some features of the current NHSN surveillance definition make its application to children problematic. Respiratory specimens, for example, must be obtained by methods that limit contamination, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, that may have Adapted from [27] technical limitations and greater risks in young patients [30] .

A pediatric-specific algorithm for VAP is not yet available, but one study that applied adult definitions retrospectively to PICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation suggests that this strategy may be useful [32] . Obstacles to diagnosis notwithstanding, VAP are the second most common HAI in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units. In the United States in 2012, there were 0.7 VAP per 1000 ventilator days in pediatric medical/surgical units [33] . Overall, between 3% and 10% of ventilated PICU patients develop VAP, a rate that is approximately threefold lower than that of adults (Table 11 .4) [34] .

VAP may, like conventional pneumonia, result from the inhalation of infectious aerosols or complicate hematogenous bacteremia or fungemia.

Micro-aspiration of upper airway secretions around the uncuffed ET commonly used in infants and children or through channels formed by folds in low-pressure high-volume cuffed ET may be exacerbated by the impairment of mucociliary clearance and pooling of secretions in the subglottic airway. Risk factors for VAP in children include a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, prior antimicrobial exposure, and the use of immunosuppressing drugs, particularly corticosteroids [38] . Additional contributing elements may include the replacement of the usual microbiological flora of the oropharynx and stomach by more virulent species (such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gramnegative bacilli), the contamination of suction equipment (particularly associated with the use of open systems and nonsterile solutions), and the presence of a nasogastric tube, enteral feeding, poor oral hygiene, gastric distension, and positioning (with the semirecumbent position associated with a lower risk of VAP than the supine position).

SPS provides a document that includes prevention bundle information for CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP infections [57] . Listed in Table 11 .6 are examples of elements included in these bundles that focus on standards for both insertion and maintenance of devices for CLABSI and CAUTI and important processes for the prevention of VAP. Of note, the insertion bundle elements were developed for bedside insertion in the ICU, not for line placement in an operating room. Bundle elements are stratified based on their level of evidence to provide hospitals with guidance for prioritizing their efforts. The SPS document lists standard and recommended bundle elements and provides tools for assessing the reliability of these bundles, such as protocols for audits of performance on all SPS Prevention Bundle Standard elements [57, 58] . Institutions can choose to include additional elements if they desire to gather data on other processes, but SPS suggests limiting these to five or fewer so that healthcare staff are not overwhelmed or confused by the number of interventions [57] . For CLABSI and CAUTI, it is recommended that insertion and maintenance bundles be measured separately. SPS recommends performing a minimum of 20 audits per month in order to obtain data frequently enough to rapidly identify barriers to compliance and to make changes in the processes to eliminate these barriers [57] . A 90% compliance rate for bundle data is a common goal within SPS. Organizations using sophisticated electronic health records (EHR) with capabilities to discretely document and subsequently retrieve data may be able to gather some or all data electronically.
