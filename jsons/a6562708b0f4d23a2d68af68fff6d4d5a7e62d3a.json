In the midst of the unprecedented coronavirus disease pandemic, our nation has been mired in a crisis unlike any we have previously faced. From a medical standpoint, healthcare communities, despite insufficient resources, have scrambled to provide appropriate patient care to both infected and non-infected patients while also protecting healthcare personnel. Considerable debate, from national news broadcasts to social media platforms, coupled with massive federal deregulation, has spawned rapid adjustments to attempt to preserve the important principles of medicine -patient care, education, and research. With this crisis, a call for the emergence of virtual applications has been echoed (1). In the current commentary, we discuss how the medical community can use this time of peril to implement virtual changes in healthcare delivery to strive for a better tomorrow.",

            "text": "Reports have described a significant reduction in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and other medical emergencies coinciding with an 800% increase in cardiac arrest deaths at home in New York City (4). A contributing explanation may be that symptomatic patients, afraid of possible COVID-19 exposure or wary of long wait times, choose to endure worrisome symptoms at home rather than seek care. Virtual triage, a role that might be staffed by personnel who may otherwise be furloughed, could be used to help patients determine if urgent care is necessary and/or to divert \"persons under investigation\" to hospitals dedicated to care for COVID-19 patients. In the future, these systems can be maintained to significantly reduce costs associated with unnecessary Emergency Department care and improve ambulatory access. Moreover, as much of medical decision making is cognitive, virtual medicine may also be applied to other aspects of acute care, including tele-intensive care units (5) and remote robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (6) . Accordingly, virtual applications in acute care can be used to improve access, resource allocation, protection of healthcare personnel and patients, and reduce treatment delays. Similar innovation is feasible when communication is required between the healthcare team and a patient's immediate family, including procedure consent. Frequently, care is delayed and hospitalizations are prolonged due to inability of the care team to contact an appropriate power-of-attorney or families to reach consensus on care plans for critically ill patients. By utilizing virtual communication, the healthcare team may be better equipped to provide an accurate description of prognosis, answer questions amongst family members present and not present, and create a sense of trust and collaboration between all parties. In a system in which end-of-life spending is a major component of aggregate medical expenditure, this measure may potentially reduce overall costs while improving the opportunity for all family members to participate in decisions.",

In the future, more academic sessions for trainees can be performed in this fashion. Some medical schools have already created virtual anatomy laboratories that do not require access to the limited resource of cadavers. Similar platforms may be utilized to enhance grand rounds and other departmental educational forums.

Journals of all tiers have placed calls for articles and rapidly performed peer review to allow for dissemination of knowledge. In times like these, collaboration and communication across medical communities is as important as ever. Dissemination of knowledge and perspective, particularly in a timely manner, is paramount and serves as an invaluable tool both in medical care as well as policy formation.
