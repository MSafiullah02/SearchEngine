For example, high uncertainty can lead to more anxiety and panic for investors, subsequently creating more volatility on the financial markets (Jawadi et al. 2017). The recent and ongoing risk of the Coronavirus epidemic, for instance, has made investors highly uncertain and anxious, and as a result, the French, German and US stock markets lost over 10% of their value in the last week of February 2020 and more recently, which are the highest losses since 2008. This recent occurrence illustrates the significant relationship between the stock market and investors\u2019 behavior, attention and attitude.",

In particular, we focus on the Islamic stock market in the US and its interaction with investor attention. Islamic finance emerged as an alternative form of finance in the aftermath of the global finance crisis in 2008. The huge losses experienced by investors resulted in severe criticism of the conventional financial system. This led to an increase in investors\u2019 interest in the Islamic stock market since the latter appeared to provide an investment framework that is more social, societal, ethical and less risky than the conventional financial system.",

The Shariah law regulations are based on specific rules, such as prohibition of interest rates, speculation and uncertainty; the sharing of both profit and loss; and greater transparency (Jawadi et al. 2014). However, investor interest in Islamic finance has mainly been observed in the last decade, especially during the severe downturns in the conventional financial investment markets, in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis.",

Accordingly, and given the presence of heterogeneous investors (Jawadi et al. 2017), investor sentiment could impact the Islamic stock market differently depending on the actors who dominate the market. Indeed, the dynamics of the Islamic stock market may be galvanized in two ways: by pure drivers of conventional stock markets (unethical investors according to Shariah law) or investor attention, corresponding to the stabilizing actions of ethically principled investors.",

In particular, it enables us to further capture the effects of investor attention and interest in Islamic Finance for lower as well as higher quantiles. This specification has the advantage of capturing further asymmetry, nonlinearity and time-variation in the relationship between investor attention and Islamic stock returns. Further, unlike previous related studies, we proxy investor sentiment with a Google Search index using specific research and interest in the Islamic stock market, and we test its capacity to forecast future Islamic stock returns. Our findings show that investor attention has a significant impact on Islamic returns, and that investor attention helps to drive Islamic stock returns higher.",

According to Calvo, investors in emerging markets are less rational and less informed and their strong interest could thus generate lower stock returns as they may overreact to negative signals.",

Next, from the OLS(1*) line, we note that when we augment Eq.

The effect of the conventional stock market is positive and significant, however, and higher than that of market attention.

Interestingly, we show that the attention effect enters nonlinearity and has a time-varying impact on Islamic stock returns. Indeed, while investor attention might reduce the increase in Islamic stock returns around the low quantile, its effect is significantly more simulative around the high quantile. This suggests for higher Islamic stock returns, Islamic finance become more attractive and therefore more driven by investor\u2019s attention, as investors seek for highest benefits. Finally, we find that investor attention could help to improve the forecasting of future Islamic returns.
