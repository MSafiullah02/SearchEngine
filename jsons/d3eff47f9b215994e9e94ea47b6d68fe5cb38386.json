However, the impact of HIV-1 viremia on CCL2 regulation is largely unknown. We utilized a DNA oligonucleotide microarray covering 110 inflammatory genes. Five genes were induced by at least 2-fold in PBMCs of HIV-1 viremic (>100.000 RNA copies ml \u00ff1 ) as compared with aviremic (<50 RNA copies ml \u00ff1 ) individuals. These genes were CCL2, CXC chemokine ligand-10, IFN-c, GTP-cyclohydrolase-1 and C-C chemokine receptor-1. In addition to microarray data verification by real-time PCR, analysis of independent patient samples revealed a similar expression pattern. CCL2 was the most strongly regulated gene at mRNA level and its serum concentration was significantly elevated in viremic compared with aviremic and HIV-1 seronegative controls, indicating a positive correlation between viremia and CCL2. Flow cytometric studies demonstrated a higher percentage of CCL2-expressing CD141 monocytes in viremic compared with aviremic individuals. These results suggest a highly restricted modulation of host inflammatory gene response by HIV. Genes up-regulated in the viremic state, in particular CCL2, presumably serve as potential enhancing factors in HIV-1 replication, represented by high viral load in HIV-1 viremic patients.

As expected, monocytes were primary producers of CCL2. The dot plot analysis clearly indicated a higher production of CCL2 by CD14+ monocytes derived from viremic patients (Fig. 4A ).

Only when viral replication is detected, as found in viremic patients, the host inflammatory response leads to an increase in mRNA expression of specific inflammatory genes. Monocytes from HIV-1 patients have been shown to express more CCL2 when compared with healthy controls (29) . In this regard, our flow cytometric analysis of patient-derived PBMC showed a clear increase in the CCL2-expressing CD14+ monocytes in viremic patients. This increase in the percentage of CD14+CCL2+ monocytes inversely correlates with the CD4+ T cell count. Since low CD4+ T cell count is associated with viremia and disease progression, an increased expression of CCL2 in these patients could potentially reflect an additional marker of disease progression. CCL2 is induced in many inflammatory diseases including infection with various bacterial and viral pathogens. Production of CCL2 is not specific to HIV-1. Several other viruses have been shown to induce CCL2 expression. For example, viruses such as human rhinovirus (30) , respiratory syncytial virus (31) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (32) and SHIV (33) , the best available primate model of HIV-1 infection, have been reported to induce CCL2 expression. Recently, it has been shown that the recruitment of CD4+ T cells by CXCL10 and 11 produced by HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells in lymphoid organs contributes to HIV-1 disease (34) . In this regard, in vitro HIV-1 infection of macrophages is already known to activate CCL2 expression and CCL2 may potentially influence HIV-1 pathogenesis (22) . We also observed a similar transcriptional regulation in the CCL2 gene in in vitro HIV-1 infection of PBMC obtained from four healthy volunteers. A very recent study using a mouse model of HIV-1 infection demonstrated CCL2 gene induction in brain tissues of infected animals (35) . These data suggest that HIV-1 viremia alters the transcriptional program of the host cytokine/chemokine network, and this effect is most prominent with respect to CCL2 expression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 447, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1214, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1267, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1281, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1593, "text": "(34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1755, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2037, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Transcriptional regulation could be translated into production of CCL2 because significantly elevated serum CCL2 concentrations were observed in HIV-1 viremic as compared with aviremic or healthy individuals. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a positive correlation between viremia and serum CCL2. Interestingly, an inverse correlation of CD4+ T cells was associated with more CCL2-expressing CD14+ monocytes. Since CCL2 is a strong lymphocyte chemoattractant, its higher production by host cells upon HIV-1 infection may result in recruitment of more target cells to the site of infection, resulting in higher HIV-1 replication and rapid spreading of the virus (Fig. 5) . We can assume that the concentration of CCL2 at the site of infection is much higher than in the periphery; hence, a strong recruitment of CCR2-expressing target cells can be expected. CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, is expressed on the majority of monocytes and to a lesser extent on CD4+ T cells. However, we could not observe any significant effect of viremia on CCR2 expression on these cells, suggesting CCL2 concentration-dependent but surface CCR2-independent recruitment of target cells to the site of infection. Higher CCL2 expression might be at least in part mediated by TNF-a since it is a well-known inducer of CCL2, and higher TNF-a levels are associated with viremia as reported in many studies. Moreover, prior exposure of monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages to b-chemokines has already been shown to enhance viral replication (36) . Treatment with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir reduces the plasma CCL2 level in severely immunodeficient HIV-infected individuals (37) . This effect is most likely explained by reduced viral replication due to effective treatment with indinavir. A higher level of CCL2 has been previously reported in HIV-1 patients plasma (38) ; however, there was no discrimination between viremic and aviremic patients. Here, we report that CCL2 is regulated not only at the protein but also at the mRNA level in HIV-1-infected viremic individuals. The potential role of CCL2 in HIV-1 replication in vitro can be explained in PHA blast model of HIV-1 IIIB infection. We observed >2-fold increase in the viral titer after 5 days of post-infection (data not shown), which is in line with previous reports (23, 39) .
