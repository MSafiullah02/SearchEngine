Seven samples were diarrheic feces, and the other seven were small intestines from piglets. We failed to isolate the virus from feces but successfully isolated two viruses from intestines obtained from Tochigi and Nagasaki prefectures. To isolate the virus, we used Vero-KY5 cells (Vero) , which were kindly provided by the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), Japan. Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB, Difco, Detroit, MI, USA). The transparent parts of the small intestine, indicating infection with PEDV, 10-15 cm in length, were filled with 5-10 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and massaged gently to detach infected epithelial cells. PBS was collected, homogenized using a glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C to remove cell debris. The supernatants were filtered through a 450 nm pore-size filter to remove contaminating bacteria. Diarrheic feces were diluted 10-fold with PBS and treated in the same manner as the intestines, described above. These samples were inoculated onto Vero cells prepared in 24-well plates by spinoculation, as described previously (Watanabe et al., 2006) . Briefly, Vero cells seeded at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 per well in a 24-well culture plate (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were inoculated with 50 l filtered samples and 400 l DMEM per well. The plates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C and then at 3000 rpm for 1 h at 24 \u2022 C.

Both viruses produced syncytia in Vero cells, although the syncytia were smaller than those generated by the vaccine type MK strain, which is adapted to Vero cells (Kusanagi et al., 1992) (Fig. 1A-C) . Syncytial cells contained viralspecific antigen, as revealed by immunofluorescence ( Fig. 1E-G) .

The PCR products were purified using the NucleoSpin \u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and then sequenced using the primers shown in Table 1 . Sequence analysis was performed by Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan, and amino acid (aa) sequences of the S proteins were deduced from the nucleotide sequences. An aa alignment of the S protein of the two novel isolates, MK and three US PEDV strains (MN-KF468752, IA1-KF468753, and IA2-KF468754), is shown in Fig. 2 . All of the US strains and Nagasaki and Tochigi were closely related genetically (99.42-99.97% aa identity) and differed from each other by 1-8 aa throughout the entire S protein. However, the new isolates and the US strains were genetically different from the vaccine type MK strain, ranging from 92.84-93.15% similarity (95-99 aa differences between MK versus Tochigi, Nagasaki and the other US strain). Alignment of the aa sequence of those strains identified two regions of aa deletions in the MK strain (aa 59-62 and 140) compared with the other strains. There was also one region of aa insertion in MK (aa 160 and 161) compared with the other strains (Fig. 2) . A total of 45 PEDV viruses (2 isolated in this study, 3 US strains, the MK strain, 5 S-INDEL PEDV strains and 34 other globally endemic PEDV strains) were used for phylogenetic analysis based on the S protein (Fig. 3) , which demonstrated that the new Japanese isolates were closely related to the new US isolates. Forty five PEDV strains clustered into group I or II. The above-mentioned five strains, but not the MK strain and seven Taiwan PEDV isolates as well as 5 S-INDEL PEDV strains, were clustered within group II together with 13 strains detected in China from 2011 to 2012.

The MK strain induces syncytium formation in the presence of trypsin (Shirato et al., 2010; Kusanagi et al., 1992) , as did the new isolates Tochigi and Nagasaki, while the vaccine strain commercially available in Japan induces cell rounding and detachment without trypsin treatment. We therefore used the MK strain rather than the vaccine strain to perform NT, because the MK, Tochigi and Nagasaki strains can be examined under identical conditions. Moreover, there was no antigenic difference between Tochigi and Nagasaki in NT (data not shown). Two types of PEDV antisera were used. One type comprised 18 sera collected from herds of pigs that were vaccinated but not recently infected by PEDV, and the other comprised 17 sera from herds of pigs that were vaccinated and infected with a new PEDV strain. NT was performed as follows. Two hundred l of serum were serially diluted in twofold steps with DMEM and then mixed with an equal volume of viral suspension containing 100 TCID 50 /100 l and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 60 min. Then, 50 l of each dilution were inoculated into each well (4 wells per dilution) of a 96-well plate containing confluent Vero cells and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. Then, the mixture was removed, and cells were washed twice with DMEM and, finally, incubated at 37 \u2022 C with 50 l DMEM containing 5% TPB and trypsin (10 g/ml). Neutralization antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited syncytium formation in at least two of four wells. As shown in Fig. 4A , all sera from pigs vaccinated but not infected by the new PEDV strain, namely pig farms vaccinated without recent PED incidence, showed almost identical neutralization titers against the MK strain and the new isolate. In some cases, the titer was twofold higher for group I virus compared with group II virus. These data indicate no significant difference in the antigenicity of viruses in terms of neutralization activity. A twofold difference in titer between group I and II viruses has also been reported by others (Wang et al., 2016) . Similar results were obtained using sera from pigs vaccinated and infected with the new PEDV strain; namely pig farms vaccinated and recent PED incidence, (Fig. 4B) . No pig serum showed a higher titer to the new isolates than to MK, suggesting that those pigs were not infected even if the farm was affected by the new PEDV strain. Alternatively, it could indicate that antiserum against group I vaccine also protected against infection by group II viruses, and thus no antibodies were elicited by group II viruses. Collectively, these data indicated that neutralizing antigenicity does not differ between MK (group I) and the new isolates (group II).
