Children aged 3 to 6 months are most prone to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting that a developmental component (e.g., lung or immunologic maturation) may be involved as well. 77, 83\n",

Variations in reporting longitudinal outcomes (e.g., recurrent wheezing, measurements of airway hyperresponsiveness, diagnosis of asthma) appear to be influenced mostly by the criteria used to define \u201cbronchiolitis.\u201d These criteria include the type of virus producing the symptoms (in addition to RSV, viruses that may contribute to the development of bronchiolitis in this age group could be PIV, coronavirus, influenzavirus, and rhinovirus33); the age at the time of infection; the nature and severity of symptoms required for inclusion; and, finally, the characteristics of both the study population (community versus hospital-based) and the study design (retrospective versus prospective). A number of long-term prospective studies of children admitted to a hospital with documented RSV-induced bronchiolitis have shown that about 75% experience wheezing in the first 2 years after the initial illness, more than 50% still wheeze 3 years later, and approximately 40% continue to wheeze after 5 years. 42, 49, 73, 91, 117, 121\n",

During the first 3 years of life, 7.4% had pneumonia documented radiographically and 44.7% had a significant LRI without pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus and PIV were identified in 36.4% and 7.3%, respectively, in the subjects with pneumonia, and in 35.6% and 15.2%, respectively, of the subjects with a LRI. At age 6, physician-diagnosed asthma was present in 13.6% (OR = 3.3), 10.2% (OR = 2.4), and 4.6% of the subjects with pneumonia, LRI, and no LRI, respectively. By age 11, these values increased to 25.9% (OR = 2.8), 16.1% (OR = 1.6), and 11%, respectively. Mean maximum volume at functional residual capacity values before any LRI were lower in children with pneumonia and with LRIs than in children with no LRIs. These values continued to be lower at age 6 and by age 11, when forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEF25\u201375 were recorded, similar group relationships persisted. Interestingly, despite the persistence of lowered baseline lung function in both the pneumonia and LRI groups, many of these deficits were markedly (but not completely) reduced following administration of albuterol.",

The G (attachment) and F (fusion) proteins are the major surface glycoproteins against which neutralizing antibody is directed. Interestingly, in both murine2 and human51 in vitro experiments, it has been noted that the G protein elicits a predominant Th2 response, whereas the F protein produces a predominant Th1 response. In mice, to test the activities of T cells recognizing individual RSV proteins in vivo, virus-specific T-cell lines have been produced using recombinant vaccinia viruses that express either the G or F proteins. Following passive transfer of these cell lines to naive recipients and subsequent intranasal inoculation with RSV, mice receiving G-specific cells have more severe illnesses, characterized by lung hemorrhage, pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, and intense pulmonary eosinophilia.1 These experiments are of interest based on the adverse clinical response noted in many infants who received a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine and subsequently became infected with RSV.77\n",

Roman et al evaluated 15 hospitalized infants (1\u201315 months) with an acute lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV. Compared with control infants, peripheral blood cells from infected children had suppressed IFN-\u03b3 production ex vivo and, although IL-4 production was also decreased, the IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio was significantly increased. Renzi et al88 prospectively followed 26 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis by obtaining blood samples at the time of illness and 5 months later, and found that immune responses during the acute infection correlated with long-term pulmonary outcomes. Blood lymphocytes, obtained during the time of bronchiolitis, produced less IFN-\u03b3 ex vivo in response to IL-2 and more IL-4 in response to D. farinae antigen in children who went on to develop a pattern of recurrent wheezing.88 Finally, lower IFN-\u03b3 production at the time of bronchiolitis has been demonstrated to be an indicator of reduced pulmonary function and increased responsiveness to histamine 5 months after bronchiolitis, and was related to the development of asthma after bronchiolitis in infants.87 In contrast, other groups have noted increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 respiratory tract secretions during RSV illnesses in infants and children with bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing compared with those with upper respiratory tract symptoms only.113 Unfortunately, in all of the studies reported thus far, the pattern of cytokine response these infants had prior to infection was not evaluated, begging the question as to which of the observed results may be cause and which effect.",

The use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that are more sensitive for detection of RV have confirmed and expanded these initial observations.58 Indeed, Johnston et al57 found that 80% to 85% of school-aged children with acute wheezing episodes tested positive for a virus using RT-PCR and other standard virologic techniques. The virus most often detected was RV. Seasonal patterns of upper respiratory virus infections correlate closely with hospital admissions for asthma, particularly in pediatric age groups.55 These studies indicate that RV infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in children, especially during spring and fall. Similar studies, performed in adults, 74 found that about half of asthma exacerbations were associated with RV infection.",

Children over 2 years of age were more likely to have respiratory allergies or a confirmed respiratory viral infection compared with children with no wheezing. Children with the highest risk for wheezing were those who had respiratory allergies and respiratory viral infection, implying that respiratory viral infections and respiratory allergies may have synergistic effects on lower airway physiology and enhance the likelihood of wheezing with respiratory infection. In children less than 2 years of age, wheezing was also noted, but risk factors for wheezing were quite different. These infants were not allergic, had RSV as the major viral isolate, and had passive tobacco smoke exposure as a major risk factor for wheezing.",

In addition to serving as host cells, it is now well documented that epithelial cells also initiate the immune response to infections through the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. In vitro studies of epithelial cells or cell lines have demonstrated that respiratory viruses such as RV, RSV, and parainfluenzavirus can induce the secretion of many different proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-11) and chemokines (RANTES, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1). 10, 20, 23, 96, 98, 105 Epithelial-derived chemokines are likely to be an important signal in initiating antiviral responses through the recruitment of leukocytes to the airway. In support of this concept, IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, is found in high levels in nasal secretions of children with virus-induced asthma, and levels of IL-8 correlate with the number of airway neutrophils and neutrophil myeloperoxidase levels (suggesting neutrophil activation).108 There is also evidence, however, that enhanced airway inflammation caused by chemokine secretion may also disturb normal airway physiology. Chemokine levels in nasal secretions correlate closely with cold symptoms, 110 for example, and IL-8 levels correlate with virus-induced changes in airway responsiveness.41 Levels of epithelial-derived cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-11 also correlate with respiratory symptoms, 23 and animal studies indicate that overexpression of IL-11 can cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 23, 107\n",

To test the possibility that variations in lymphocyte responses might account for variability in the ability to clear viral infections, Parry et al80 measured in vitro lymphocyte responses in a group of allergic subjects who were then inoculated with RV 16. Vigorous virus-induced responses (lymphocyte proliferation or IFN-\u03b3 secretion) before inoculation correlated with reduced viral shedding after inoculation. These results suggest that factors related to the host cellular response help determine the degree of viral replication during respiratory viral infections.

First, there is increasing evidence that severe infections with RSV and PIV in infancy can alter lung development and physiology to increase the risks of subsequent wheezing and asthma. Second, infections with common cold viruses and influenza commonly precipitate wheezing symptoms in children and adults who already have established asthma, and RV appears to be the most important virus in producing exacerbations of the disease. The principal mechanisms by which this occurs appears to be viral replication in epithelial cells, triggering a cascade of inflammation involving granulocytes, macrophages, T cells, and secreted cytokines and mediators. The inflammatory process, although essential to clear the infection, augments pre-existing airway inflammation in asthma, leading to increased airway obstruction and lower respiratory tract symptoms. Greater understanding of virus-induced changes in inflammation and corresponding changes in airway physiology may lead to new therapeutic approaches to the treatment and prevention of virus-induced airway dysfunction.",
