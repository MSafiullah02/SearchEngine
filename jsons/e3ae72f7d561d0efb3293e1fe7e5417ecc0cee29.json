One of the concerns with the use of peptides as opposed to proteins as molecular probes is the potential loss of information as a result of the missing structural context (Mahrenholz et al. 2010 ). There is a much higher degree of entropy in the structures of peptides than with macromolecules such as proteins which are much more constrained. Arrays of proteins have the distinct advantage in being able to mimic their physiological counterparts through presenting full-length proteins that are likely in their native 3D conformations and with proper PTMs and associated proteins, to facilitate investigation of protein-protein interactions and assay of physiological activities. However, the molecular cloning and expression of tens of thousands of proteincoding genes with optimal covalent modifications and in combination with activating subunits has been proven to be technologically challenging, which significantly hampers the development and application of protein microarrays.",

The utility of these peptide microarrays has been demonstrated in some large-scale systems biology studies on the dynamics of protein interactions in cell signaling networks as well as kineome (also known as kinome) activity profiling.

The resulting membrane-based arrays are usually at low to medium density and can be used directly for downstream assays such as antibody epitope mapping. Recently, improvements have been introduced allowing peptides either to be cleaved from the membrane using strong bases or to be recovered from individual spots as soluble peptides. For this purpose, they are synthesized on acid-labile cellulose membranes (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-soluble), allowing postsynthesis printing of the recovered peptides on selected array surfaces at a higher density (Zander et al. 2005; Hilpert et al. 2007) .",

(1991a, b) on the basis of the addressable surface activation concept. Compared to SPOT synthesis, photolithographic synthesis of peptides on array surface is more suitable for generating high-density arrays. However, it is both laborious and expensive. It requires the use of special photolabile protected amino acid derivatives as building blocks and of photomasks through which a laser is then used to activate specific areas on the array to cleave photolabile protecting groups. Even though the technique was initially developed for peptide synthesis, it was more easily adopted for the production of oligonucleotide arrays, due to the complexity of making masks for each of the 20 amino acids for every coupling cycle, as opposed to only four bases in oligonucleotide array production (Pease et al. 1994; McGall and Fidanza 2001) . In recent years, a number of modifications have been introduced, including the uses of conventional amino acids and photogenerated reagents, resulting in the improvement of efficiency and the reduction in cost for array production (Singh-Gasson et al. 1999; Gao et al. 2003; Bhushan 2006; Shin et al. 2010) .",

The approach is particularly useful when multiple copies of the same array with high density are required. Furthermore, peptides can be purified after synthesis and prior to array printing to avoid any complications that may stem from peptide impurity. Various chemistries have been utilized for immobilizing peptides onto the array surfaces. One of the popular approaches is to attach N-terminal biotinylated peptides onto avidin/ streptavidin-coated microarray slides (Lesaicherre et al. 2002) . Covalently immobilizing peptides through a terminal Cys onto a surface functionalized with maleimide groups or disulfide is also a method that is being used quite commonly (Inamori et al. 2008) . The suitability of immobilization chemistry varies according to the nature of the peptide as well as the downstream applications of the array. In our hands, attaching peptides through the N-terminal free amino groups to a surface functionalized with epoxide groups worked very well for assaying protein kinase activity (see below). Thus, it is very important and necessary to determine which strategy should be used for preparing peptide arrays already prior to peptide synthesis, according to the intended application of the resulting arrays.",

There are two main strategies to be deployed for determining consensus phosphorylation sequences for protein kinases. On the one hand, peptide macroarrays featuring combinatorial peptide libraries or random peptide libraries such as those on the SPOT cellulose membranes were indispensable tools for elucidating the recognition sequences targeted by the kinases for which little information on their physiological substrates is available. The availability of expanding collections of recombinant active protein kinases in the past several years has facilitated the effort in this front. On the other hand, incorporation of increasing numbers of physiological phosphorylation sites uncovered through recent large-scale mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics studies into peptide microarrays has also significantly improved the efficiency of the substrate peptide screening process.",

One of the main issues associated with the current approach is the overlapping specificity among protein kinases dictated by the promiscuity in substrate recognition, especially for the kinases from the same or related families. Phosphorylation of a peptide on each spot may represent the sum of activity of all the kinases targeting this particular peptide. Indeed, a specific phosphosite sequence may be optimized through evolution to be recognized by a panel of kinases and phosphatases and not be optimized for an individual kinase or phosphatase. Thus, under most circumstances, it is impossible to directly correlate the level of peptide phosphorylation on the array with the activity of a specific kinase. It is even more challenging when the activity of kinases in crude cell or tissue lysates is to be assessed, where the cell compartmentalization has been destroyed and the proper subcellular localization of proteins cannot be maintained.",

The algorithm was built based on the information gathered through manual analysis of close to 10,000 confirmed kinase-substrate pairs for 229 typical kinases. Coupling with the alignment of the primary amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of protein kinases, the specificity-determining residues (SDRs) were identified, and the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) was generated for each of the kinases for predicting their respective recognition sequences around the phosphorylation site. The PSSMs were then used to derive the optimal substrate peptide sequences. In total, 445 15-mer peptides corresponding to the predicted sequences with a single phosphorylatable residue (Ser, Thr, or Tyr) in the middle were synthesized and immobilized onto an epoxysilane-coated glass microarray surface. The resulting peptide microarray was made up of four identical subfields to allowing four kinase assays to be run in parallel. Phosphorylation of the peptides on the array was carried out by applying active protein kinases individually into each field under their respective assay conditions, and the extent of peptide phosphorylation was then detected with Pro-Q Diamond (Life Technologies), a fluorescent dye that had been validated to bind specifically to phosphorylated residues including Ser, Thr, and Tyr, regardless the context of sequences they are in. So far, over 200 protein kinases have been assayed. Many highly reactive and selective peptides have been identified as substrates for the kinases tested. While most of the sequences conformed to those reported previously, some novel motifs were also uncovered. Detailed analysis of the \"hit\" peptide sequences is expected to reveal the prototype optimal substrate peptides unique to each kinase, which will then be further optimized for their reactivity and selectivity using an oriented peptide library approach. It is expected in the near future a peptide microarray spotted with substrate peptides that are preoptimized to each of the kinases will become available from Kinexus for kineome profiling in complex biological samples.",

Despite prevailing evidence that short synthetic phosphopeptides are poor phosphatase substrates compared to their parent proteins (Zhao and Lee 1997) , as supported by the role of regulatory subunits in forming the substrate-binding sites required for substrate recognition according to crystallography studies (Virshup and Shenolikar 2009) , several phosphopeptide-based studies have been reported that aimed at the delineation of substrate preferences using either activity-or interaction-based approaches (Sun et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2002) .",

Hence, serological mapping has become one of the most sought after applications of the peptide array technology, as it appears to have the greatest clinical potential. Peptide libraries featuring fragments derived from autoantigens, allergens, or viral proteins presented on either the SPOT membrane-based peptide macroarrays or glass slide-based peptide microarrays have been used for antibody profiling in clinical samples. The clinical potential of such analyses have been shown by their use for antibody spectrum profiling in the sera from patients infected with hepatitis B and C, with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, and with herpes virus. This provides crucial information not only for infection diagnostics but also for the development of vaccines (Neuman de Vegvar et al. 2003; Duburcq et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2004; Andresen and Gr\u20ac otzinger 2009) .",

As increasing numbers of kinase substrate peptides have been identified in recent years, peptide microarrays with the capability of screening a broad range of protein kinases have been established and used to profile the aberrant kinase activity in clinical samples as well as for monitoring the response to kinase inhibitory compounds in a highthroughput manner. This underscores the potential of peptide arrays in disease diagnosis and drug discovery (Piersma et al. 2010 ). Among the handful of studies reported so far in this area, Schrage et al. (2009) recently reported the activation of multiple pathways in relation to AKT/GSK3b, PDGFRB, and Src protein kinases in chondrosarcoma cells on a kinase substrate peptide array containing 1,024 peptides. Supplemented with the cell viability data in vitro, the study indicated that the Src inhibitor dasatinib is a potential treatment option for patients who are inoperable (Schrage et al. 2009 ). Tuynman and colleagues investigated the molecular mechanism underlying anticarcinogenic activity of celecoxib (Celebrex), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, against colorectal cancer (CRC) using a kinase substrate peptide array with 1,176 different kinase substrate consensus sequences and found that celecoxib represses c-Met-dependent signaling, which in turn led to downregulation of oncogenic Wnt signaling in CRC, supporting the potential of targeting c-Met and Wnt signaling in CRC therapy (Tuynman et al. 2008) .",

Signals being detected by a membrane-bound receptor are transduced to the inner parts of the cell to result in an appropriate response. This happens via highly complex cascades of events in which the signal is received and propagated using transphosphorylation reactions (Fig. 7.3) . These reactions are catalyzed by protein kinases together with the crucial ATP molecule. ATP is important as not only does it provide the kinase's energy source, it also supplies the phosphate moiety, vital to the whole signal transduction cascade. A kinase becomes activated and places this phosphate group on a substrate protein; this being the subsequent link in the signal transduction pathway. Often this substrate protein is a kinase as well. A signal transduction event can be compared to a relay in athletics, where each kinase gets activated by an upstream event and subsequently passes on the baton to the next member downstream in the pathway. Most protein kinases have distinct preferences for the aromatic hydroxyl groups of tyrosine residues or for the aliphatic serines or threonines. It is this characteristic which divides this family of more than 500 members into two kinase subfamilies: proteintyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-serine/threonine kinases (STKs).",

Thus, the peptides represent the protein substrates. As has been discussed in the previous chapters, this can be done in a variety of ways, but all are based on a solid support. In most cases, the sequences are derived from known phosphorylation sites in the human proteome. As the human proteome is estimated to comprise more than a million proteins, of which more than two-thirds can be phosphorylated, this indicates the huge amount of different phosphosites that can be investigated by peptide arrays.",

This approach is increasingly being replaced by the use of fluorescence assays. In the latter case, the phosphorylation of the peptide is detected by a fluorescently labeled molecule which is either a chelator (e.g., phosphotag) or an antibody. Ideally, the antibody needs to detect the phosphoamino acid in all the available peptide sequences on the chip equally well and independently of the adjacent amino acids. Antibodies like PY20 work very well in detecting tyrosine phosphorylated peptides, but for serine/ threonine phosphorylated peptides, cocktails are needed for full coverage of detection.",

Later, protocols were developed based on the fluorescent readout of labeled antibodies (or cocktails of antibodies) binding to phosphorylated peptides.

With this technology, antibody-based fluorescence detection has been combined with a change of solid support from glass slides to a porous ceramic. In this format, the sample is pumped up and down through the porous aluminum oxide ceramic sheets, in which the peptides are immobilized at designated spots. Each spot comprises thousands of separated pores with diameters of 0.2 mm in which the peptides are site-specifically immobilized. Each time the sample is below the solid support, the degree of phosphorylation is monitored by imaging the fluorescence intensities caused by the antibody binding to the phosphorylated peptides alone. These time curves, or kinetic readouts, appear to be instrumental in the enzymatic studies; a kinase is after all an enzyme which catalyzes the rate (the kinetics) of a phosphorylation reaction. In addition, the kinetic and multi(time) step readout for each of the 144 or 256 peptides on each single array allows much more comprehensive statistical analysis of the signals than data from a single time point per peptide spot on a glass array (Thilakarathne et al. 2011) .",

Every time when the sample is positioned below the microarray, an image is taken of the microarray by a CCD camera (middle panel). Via this realtime imaging of the microarray, the signal, developing in the peptide spots due to binding of fluorescent antibody detecting peptides phosphorylated by the kinases, can be monitored (Schutkowski et al. 2004 ). Another interesting application was explored by Poot et al. who identified an optimal substrate for PKC isozymes and coupled this peptide to an ATP-binding site inhibitor to generate a bisubstrate (Poot et al. 2009; van Ameijde et al. 2010) . The peptide microarrays were subsequently used to evaluate the resulting inhibitors, which were potent and selective toward the theta isozyme.",

New insights into cell signaling and signal transduction cascades have changed the way novel oncological drugs are being developed, and it is the kinase enzyme class which is playing a crucial role in this progress. Many of its members play a pivotal role in the mechanisms of tumor genesis, and some kinases are even the active protein products of oncogenes. Examples of successful cancer drugs targeting protein kinases-or the signaling pathways they are involved with-are imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and the previously mentioned sunitinib and sorafenib. These are all molecules that block the catalytic activity of protein kinases. A related class of therapeutics is antibodies, which intervene in a different way with cellular signaling: they act by blocking the initiation of receptor signaling.

In the recently developed protocols for peptide array analysis of kinases in cell and tissue lysates, the drug target can now be studied more naturally as a full-length protein, in the way it is actually expressed in cells or tissues. At first, this was shown in a model system, but interestingly, this approach appears to be translatable to patient-derived tissues. This means that the kinase drug targets can now be studied in the same form as they are expressed in a patient's tumor, thus full length, fully decorated with all relevant posttranslational modifications and in the presence of stabilizing or activating cofactors (e.g., heatshock proteins). In addition, they can be studied in the presence of all other kinases expressed in the cell or tissue being investigated. Such analysis of patient-derived tumor samples can result in the identification of tumor-specific kinase activities. When linked to pathological, diagnostic, and/or clinical data, this can lead to the identification of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. While the on-target effects are being monitored, the researchers can also obtain insights into the drug's effect(s) on other kinase targets, which are either intended-in the case of multitarget inhibitors-or unintended and can putatively cause side effects.

The classical technologies for biomarker discovery are based on testing for DNA mutation or RNA or protein expression levels. Molecular data are obtained in biopsies taken before the patient is treated. If these data can be correlated or associated to the therapy response, this can be the start of generating a companion diagnostic test. Peptide microarrays are also currently being used in this effort. While classical methods cannot involve the drug of interest in predose tissue samples, kinase microarrays can, as discussed above. In addition, the drug can actually be used in the test. This means that drugspecific data and information can be generated using predose biopsies. Proof of concept of this approach was shown by Versele et al. in a multiple cell line study. Analogous to the way it is aimed to work in a clinical setting, they profiled the lysate of a cell line on a peptide microarray in the presence and absence of their drug candidate. The inhibition profiles were used to predict the response of the cell line to drug treatment in culture. From these profiles, they could identify a set of peptide phosphorylations of which the response (inhibition) on the chip was predictive for the tumor cell proliferation (Versele et al. 2009 ). This concept (Fig. 7.6 ) is now being explored in clinical studies by my research group in collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), the VU Medical Center, and other cancer centers in both the USA and Japan. In a study presented at ASCO in 2011 on neoadjuvant treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer with the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib, we showed that candidate biomarkers could be identified. On-chip peptide phosphorylations and inhibitions were correlated to clinical responses. With no information on the pathological assessment of the resection tissues available to the testers, a model built on those profiles could still predict the pathological response (Hilhorst et al. 2011) .

In addition to their properties as solid, electrically charged particles, they also need the attributes of a solvent once melted. This change of properties happens after the particles have been addressed to their designated reaction site, where they are transformed into a liquid sphere simply by melting. Thereby, activated monomers are mobilized, which allows them to diffuse to their reaction partner for chain elongation. These very special solid/liquid characteristics of the toner particle depend on the choice of the appropriate matrix material. On the one hand, this material should withstand the harsh mechanical treatment inside the printer (e.g., friction, charging, transport); on the other hand, the liquefaction at moderate temperatures (<100 C) is fundamental in order to perform as a solvent for a chemical reaction. In addition, the matrix material should protect the reactive monomers from ambient conditions during long-term storage in cartridges, and finally, the material itself must be inert toward the components inside.",

This is, in technical terms, the main novelty of this method (Table 7 .1). As such, this method certainly soon will approach the number of different molecules that Nature's screening systems employ. These use, for example, millions of randomly generated antibodies to screen for binders against virtually any target molecule, among them nonnatural molecules that have never been encountered by evolution. Peptide arrays with natural amino acids (L-form) have been used in the past mainly as protein fragment libraries in proteome research, or as diagnostic tools for serum screening and for antibody profiling. For the development of novel therapeutics, often nonnatural amino acids (e.g., D-amino acids) were integrated at critical positions within the peptide sequence in order to increase the metabolic stability of the peptides. However, due to the use of only low-density peptide arrays, up to now, such screens usually had to rely on extensive previously available knowledge. Typically, a peptide sequence that was already known to bind to the target was then modified to improve the stability or the binding affinity, or an already known antigenic protein sequence was used to generate many overlapping peptides in order to narrow down an antibody's binding epitope.",

Very high-density peptide arrays will be used for such screens that have been cleared from all those peptides that were found to bind to more than a few different target proteins.

Highdensity peptide arrays are cheaper-they simply allow more of these experiments. It should be feasible in the future, for example, to routinely monitor the kind of antibodies that evolved in a mouse that was immunized with a protein. The experimenter could then use only those mice that evolved an antibody specific for an especially interesting epitope within the protein that was used for immunization, thus saving a lot of time and money by using only selected mice for the generation of hybridomas. Shown as an example for this statement are the results obtained when we used four different rabbit sera that were immunized with protein A and closely related protein B (Fig. 7.9 ). Only one of two rabbits immunized with protein A or with protein B revealed that specific antibodies have been generated, while the other two rabbits did not generate protein A-or protein B-specific antibodies. The staining pattern revealed that rabbit 1 developed several antibodies that were specific for the C-terminal region of protein A, while rabbit 3 developed antibodies that targeted the N-terminal region of protein B, and when scrutinizing the peptide sequences, both productive sera did not reveal cross-reacting antibodies against determinants from closely related proteins #A and #B.",

            "text": "A biomarker is a substance that is used as an indicator of a biological state. The biomarker serves as an indicator to measure and evaluate normal or pathogenic biological processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Especially useful are biomarkers that are found in human sera. These are a rich and accessible source for the detection of diagnostic markers in human diseases. Serum antibodies have been used extensively for diagnosis, for example, of flu antibodies in a patient. Such antibodies often are found in a patient decades after infection and can easily be analyzed with peptide arrays. Especially interesting are those (peptide-)antigens (and their corresponding antibodies) that are targeted by an immune response. These are useful as biomarkers for drug discovery and diagnostics. However, the most interesting scientific question in biomarker discovery is as follows: can we find novel antigens and their corresponding antibodies without previous knowledge about the antigen? Figure 7 .10a shows that such a scientific question could be answered with very high-density peptide arrays. A randomized high-density array of 15meric stochastically chosen peptides (only a detail view of~5,000 structures is shown) was used to find peptide binders for the Flag M2 antibody with its known binding epitope NNNDYKNNND/ENNN. Indeed, we could find six weak binders in a first screen. Sequences from all of these initial hits were then used in a follow-up screen that stained the completely permutated sequences from these initial binders. Figure 7 .10b shows such a permutation screen that started with the sequence \"ECWGDYKSMECADWH\" found as an initial hit. This sequence, and all the other five hits from the initial screen, then revealed either the sequence NNNDYKNNNENNN or NNNDYKNNNDNNN, i.e., the Flag M2 epitope. All amino acid positions depicted by \"N\" could be exchanged by other amino acids. It remains to be seen if such a screen could be employed to also find novel biomarkers when staining stochastically chosen very high-density peptide arrays with serum antibodies derived from patients with enigmatic diseases. Many protein-protein interactions are mediated by short linear motifs. Some of these interactions are deregulated in diseases and thus are potential targets for modulating peptide-based drugs. These peptides should interfere with the protein-protein interactions by binding to one of the partners, either activating or inhibiting the signals that depend on the respective proteins. Historically, and as stated above, peptide drugs have been based, for example, upon the optimization of natural peptide hormones but, more recently, novel peptides are being developed that have been isolated from combinatorial recombinant libraries. The idea is to offer such a large number of different potential peptide-based binders that simply by chance any protein would \"find\" at least one binder among a plurality of different peptides. However, the current size limits of peptide arrays and the associated costs had made it, until now, unrealistic to conduct such comprehensive profiling screens.",
