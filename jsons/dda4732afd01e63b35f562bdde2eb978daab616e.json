Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a membrane-associated aminopeptidase, and viral infection is facilitated by an interaction between the extracellular portion of ACE2 and the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. Cryogenic electron microscopy experiments show that SARS-CoV-2 has ten times the affinity to ACE2 compared with SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the SARS epidemic (5) . After engaging with ACE2, cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 primes SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for cell entry (4) . Analysis of single cell RNA-sequence datasets show that 1.4% of human type II pneumocytes express ACE2, with 0.8% of type II cells co-expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (6) . In the upper respiratory tract, ACE2 is expressed by nasal ciliated epithelial and goblet cells (7) . Recent studies suggest that ACE2 expression may be upregulated by mediators. For example, culture of primary human airway cells with interferon alpha 2 in vitro increases ACE2 transcripts (6) .",

We also found that traffic-derived PM10 upregulates ACE2 expression in human primary nasal epithelial cells, suggesting that this response occurs throughout the respiratory tract. One strength of the present study is that collection of traffic-derived PM10 by a high-volume cyclone obviated the need to extract PM from filters in solution, and we could therefore accurately determine PM10 concentrations used in cell culture studies.",

A putative protective effect of increased pulmonary ACE2 was suggested in this mouse model by complete recovery of PM-induced acute lung injury in wild type mice, and incomplete recovery in ACE2 knockout mice (11) . We therefore speculate that increased ACE2 expression may, on one hand, be a beneficial response to PM exposure, but on the other hand presents a Trojan horse to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Our finding that culture of A549 cells with 5% CSE increases ACE2 expression clearly supports these in vivo data, and suggests that cell cultures are a valid method for screening inhaled toxins for capacity to upregulate ACE2 expression. Future screening should include other inhaled toxins including those (e.g. electronic cigarette vapour and welding fumes) previously reported to upregulate expression of platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) -the host receptor used by S. pneumoniae to adhere to airway cells (13)(10).",

However, evidence for this is provided by reports of; i) an association between smoking and severity to COVID-19 (14) (15), and ii) increased expression of airway epithelial ACE2 in current smokers compared with never smokers (12) . By contrast, Jackson et al (9) speculated that lower ACE2 mRNA expression in airway brush samples from children with allergic asthma decreases their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, we have not identified how PM10 upregulates ACE2 expression on airway cells. We have previously reported that PM-induced oxidative stress increases PAFR expression on primary bronchial epithelial cells (16) , but the role of oxidative stress on ACE2 expression is as yet unknown. Finally, although the concentration of PM10 used in the present study is lower than that used in our previous in vitro study of PM and pneumococcal infection of airway cells (16) , it remains unclear to what extent 10 \u00b5g/mL reflects in vivo exposure. Assessment of ACE2 expression in nasal brushings from individuals changing from low to high pollution exposure, for example during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, offers a way of non-invasively validating results from in vitro studies.",
