The heteroleptic calcium amide 1 and the series of homoleptic heavier alkaline earth amides [M{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (M = Ca, 2a; Sr, 2b; Ba; 2c) were applied to the catalytic hydroamination of 1,3\u2010diisopropylcarbodiimide with 2\u2010fluoroaniline. Although it has proven to be a remarkably useful prototype for the elaboration of stoichiometric calcium reactivity, in the current context, use of the \u03b2\u2010diketiminato complex 1 offers no advantage over the homoleptic calcium amide 2a in terms of either activity or ease of utility. Indeed it is likely that the \u03b2\u2010diketiminate ligand is protonated and effectively removed during the early stages of catalytic turnover to provide common catalytic intermediates (viz. the homoleptic guanidinate complexes 3a and 3b, vide infra). Reactions were conducted using 2 mol\u2010% catalyst and based upon initial substrate concentrations of 0.15 m. Although, in all cases, crystallization of the product from solution was observed at room temperature, the reaction yield of the isolated guanidine was consistently low (37\u201368 %). This latter limitation could be overcome, however, by changing the conditions for what is effectively a crystallization of the reaction product upon mixing starting materials and catalyst. In this manner, increasing the concentrations of the substrates to 0.3 m and changing the reaction solvent to hexane yielded the hydroamination product [{(2\u2010FC6H5)N}C{NHiPr}2] in 71\u201384 %.

The hydroamination of both symmetric and unsymmetric carbodiimides was achieved at room temperature using 2 mol\u2010% of the calcium amide 2a. Choice of pre\u2010catalyst was dictated by its ease of synthesis and low cost. Both electron\u2010rich and electron\u2010deficient anilines react readily and, in most cases, following crystallization the guanidine products could be isolated by a simple filtration. Catalytic hydroamination reactions employing sterically demanding substrates, such as 1,3\u2010di\u2010tert\u2010butylcarbodiimide (Table 1 Entries 8, 9) and 2,6\u2010diisopropylaniline (Table 1, Entry 17, 18) however, could only be achieved at higher reaction temperatures. These observations are consistent with those previously made in stoichiometric heavier group\u20102 chemistry. For example, although the calcium amide [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{NHAr}(THF)] reacts readily with 1,3\u2010diisopropyl\u2010 and 1,3\u2010dicyclohexylcarbodiimide at room temperature, this latter complex does not undergo an insertion reaction with 1,3\u2010di\u2010tert\u2010butylcarbodiimide even after being heated to 60 \u00b0C for 12 h.15 Initial attempts to extend the catalytic methodology to primary alkylamines proved unsuccessful.

Encouraged by the synthetic ease of the procedure detailed herein, we therefore sought to investigate the limits of this catalytic reaction. A series of reactions were conducted at room temperature based upon a 60 mmol quantity of 1,3\u2010dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and aniline using 0.2\u20132 mol\u2010% of 2a. These experiments demonstrated that whilst the reaction proceeds rapidly at catalyst loadings as small as 0.5 mol\u2010% (82 %, 0.5 h), at even lower catalyst loadings product yields diminish quickly and the catalyst reaches a limit at 0.2 mol\u2010% (56 %, 48 h). In all cases, as with the small scale reactions, the product crystallizes directly from the reaction mixture.",

Crystallization of 3a from a hexane/THF solvent mixture allowed the isolation of single crystals. An X\u2010ray diffraction experiment revealed the product 3a to be a homoleptic calcium guanidinate complex with coordination at the metal provided by two unsymmetrically chelated \u03ba2\u2010N,N\u2010guanidinate ligands and two molecules of tetrahydrofuran (Figure 2 and Table 2).

Variable temperature NMR studies upon a [D8]toluene solution of 3a showed a number of reversible changes. At 298 K four independent isopropyl signals were observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In the high\u2010temperature limit (353 K) these resonances coalesced to give only two isopropyl environments. Although coalescence of the apparent two sets of twin resonances occurred at two independent temperatures [T\nA = 318 K; T\nB = 338 K] with two independent frequencies[k\nA = 34 Hz; k\nB = 117 Hz], these data gave a single activation energy [\u0394G\n\u2021 = 68 kJ mol\u20131] characterising one fluxional process. The complexity of these observations was resolved by the synthesis of a solvent\u2010free analogue of 3a. Reaction of two equivalents of [(PhN)C{NHiPr}2] with [Ca{N(SiMe3)2}2] in toluene yielded the dimeric calcium guanidinate complex 3b. An X\u2010ray crystallograpic study revealed 3b to consist, in the solid\u2010state, of a centrosymmetric dimer in which five\u2010coordinate calcium centers are bridged by unsymmetric Ca\u2013N\u2013Ca\u2032 interactions (Figure 3 and Table 2). The N\u2013C\u2013N chelate rings are disposed with and anti\u2010configuration with respect to the dimer core giving rise to an S\n2\u2010symmetric tricylic ladder structure. Further coordination at calcium is provided by terminal guanidinate ligands. As with 3a the guanidinate ligands in both terminal and bridging positions in 3b coordinate as unsymmetric \u03ba2\u2010N,N\u2010chelates. The calcium\u2013nitrogen bond lengths of the non\u2010bridging interactions [av. 2.379 \u00c5] are slightly shorter than those observed in 3a due to the higher coordination number at calcium in the former complex. The guanidinate bite angles within 3b [N(3)\u2013Ca\u2013N(1) 57.45\u00b0 and N(6)\u2013Ca\u2013N(4) 55.08\u00b0] also differ slightly from those in the monomeric species with the terminal ligands demonstrating a more obtuse bite\u2010angle than those in the bridging positions.",

Although, both compounds proved catalytically active the isolated yields of the guanidine products (3a, 1 h, 62 %; 3b, 1 h, 79 %) differed slightly from those of the amide pre\u2010catalyst [Ca{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF2)] (2a, 1 h, 74 %), most likely due to differences in the crystallization conditions of the reaction product. This observation, and consideration of our previous studies on the hydrophosphination of carbodiimides,9 suggests that the catalytic hydroamination chemistry proceeds via fast catalyst initation via silylamide protonation and carbodiimide insertion to form a group\u20102 guanidinate complex. Protonolysis of this latter species with 1 equiv. of aniline, liberates the guanidine product and reforming the transient group\u20102 amide complex (Scheme 2)",

Although initial attempts to extend this reaction chemistry to primary amines has been unsuccessful, the chemistry detailed herein represents a practical and scalable synthetic approach to guanidines. Coordination chemistry studies upon the catalytic species (M = Ca) suggest the involvement of homoleptric dimeric guanidinate complexes in solution, with catalytic turnover occurring, by analogy to our previous work,9 with fast Br\u00f8nstead acid\u2013Br\u00f8nstead base and Lewis acid\u2013Lewis base ligand\u2010exchange processes at the metal center, and carbon\u2013nitrogen bond formation proceeding by \u03c3\u2010bond metathesis and insertion reaction steps.
