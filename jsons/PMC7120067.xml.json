Applications of nanomaterials will continue to affect the food industry commercially because of their unique and novel properties. New nanomaterials are developed that will make not only a difference in the taste of food but also safety and the health benefits that food is bound to deliver.

These nanosensors are diagnostic devices to monitor the quality of food processes and also safety of food. Such nanosensors are used for the detection of very minute amounts of any chemical pollutant, virus, or bacteria in food systems. There is a possibility of combining biology with nanoscale technology in fabrication of sensors with a great potential of higher sensitivity and reduced response time. Nanoparticles may selectively attach themselves to food pathogens, and even traces of harmful pathogens could be detected with sensors using either infrared light or magnetic materials. It is advantageous that numerous nanoparticles can be placed on a single nanosensor so as to detect the presence of different bacteria and pathogens rapidly and accurately also. Another advantage is that nanosensors can gain access into the tiny crevices because of its small size, where the pathogens often used to hide, and nanotechnology will reduce the time taken for this detection from days to a few hours, minutes, or even seconds (Choudhury and Goswami 2012). Nanotechnology utilizes biological molecules like sugars or proteins as target-recognition groups for nanostructures as biosensors (Charych et al. 1996). These biosensors could serve as detectors of food pathogens and other contaminants and also to track food products.",

These are of significant importance as such devices are capable for finding out and detect very minute quantity of organic compounds, very low concentration of pathogens, and other harmful chemicals. These devices show extraordinary sensitivity, quick response, and rescue (Otles and Yalcin 2010; Yalcin and Otles 2010). Mostly, nanosensors are used in recognition of pesticide as organophosphate in plants, fruits, and aquatics. It is known that pesticides are highly permeable and soluble and these are harmful. These are extensively used in agronomy. There is significant importance in analysis of residue of highly sensitive pollutants (Mclaren et al. 2009). Nanosensors devices have benefits over other techniques like gas/liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, because they contain high surface to volume ratios, primarily loading of more antibody/enzymes (great sensitivity interface), less recognition limits, exceptional selectivity with small size, and quick response. It has been known that the use of these nanosized materials is likely to enhance the sensitive transducer indication or signals. Carbon nanotubes semiconductor and metal nanostructures have exceptional electrical or optical characteristics (Hwang et al. 2011). Intelligent packing is another aspect, where covering a nano-biosensor makes these to fluoresce in various colors on interaction with different pathogens of food materials. Various types of devices have been developed to identify contaminants, chemicals, and pathogens in food materials. Such device is highly sensitive in identifying E. coli and Salmonella (Chen et al. 2008).",

However, some faster methods are known, but they have their own limitations. Magnetic resonance can detect extremely low levels of bacteria, but it is almost ineffective at higher bacteria concentrations, while fluorescence is opposite. A hybrid nanosensor incorporating magnetic resonance and fluorescence has been developed to rapidly detect the presence of E. coli (Banerjee et al. 2016). It has been reported that detector could sense different concentrations of a pathogenic strain of E. coli known as O157: H7 during test of milk in less than an hour. Such sensors will find the use in detecting environmental contamination control in the food sectors.",

Polysaccharide and protein-based films provide good protection against oxygen and carbon dioxide, but these are poor to protect against moisture. While lipid-based nanolaminates are significantly good to protect food from moisture, they have limited resistance to gases and show poor mechanical strength. Neither polysaccharides and proteins nor lipids provide all the properties in an edible coating and identify additives. Newer additives are searched that can improve these properties, e.g., polyols. Foods can be coated with nanolaminates either by dipping them into a series of solutions containing substances or by spraying substances onto the food surface (Shit and Shah 2014). The degree of adsorption of any substance depends on the nature of surface of food as well as on the nature of the adsorbing substance. Various adsorbing substances can form different layers of a nanolaminate; some of these are polyelectrolytes (proteins and polysaccharides), charged lipids, and colloidal particles. Different nanolaminates include varying functional agents such as flavors, colors, antimicrobials, anti-browning agents, antioxidants, enzymes, etc.",

Nanofibers are usually not composed of food-grade substances; therefore, nanofibers have only fewer applications in the food industry. Nanofibers have small diameters in the size from 10 to 1000 nm, which makes them ideal to serve as a platform for bacterial cultures (Guo 2015). These could also serve as the structural matrix for artificial foods and food packaging material, which are eco-friendly. As the efforts are growing in the area of producing nanofibers from food-grade materials, their use is likely to increase in the future. Similar to nanofibers, the use of nanotubes is mainly for nonfood applications. Carbon nanotubes are commonly used as low-resistance conductors and catalytic reaction vessels. Certain globular milk proteins can self-assemble into similarly structured nanotubes in some appropriate environmental conditions (Graveland-Bikker and de Kruif 2006).",

Metal or metal oxide-based nanocomposites are used in food packaging and coating or sometimes even as ingredients of food. Silver nanoparticles and its nanocomposites are most commonly used nanomaterials as antimicrobials in the food industry (He and Hwang 2016). The use of a number of silver-containing zeolites or similar substances as food contact materials has been approved by the USFDA for the purpose of disinfection (Duncan 2011). These nanoparticles are used as a source of Ag+ ions, which binds to membrane proteins, forming pits and/or causing other morphological changes (Morones et al. 2005). These also catalyze the generation of ROS in bacterial cells, which, in turn, leads to cell death through oxidative stress (Kim et al. 2007). It has been suggested that silver nanocomposites are quite safe for packaging of food, as no detectable or negligible levels of silver nanoparticles are released, which migrate from containers to actual food samples and food stimulants (Ntim et al. 2015). Nanocomposites have an advantage of enhanced stability, which is very much required for sustaining antimicrobial activity and reducing the possibility of migration of metal ions into stored foods. Some polymers are designed to form nanocomposites with metal/metal oxide nanomaterials for various applications in food science. Polymers most widely used in nanocomposites include gelatin, polylactic acid, isotactic polypropylene, and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Nanocomposites of LDPE with metals (Ag/LDPE) and metal oxide (CuO/LDPE, TiO2/LDPE, and ZnO/LDPE) are used in some food applications. Apart from these ZnO/gelatin, ZnO/polylactic acid, and ZnO/graphene oxide/polylactic acid, ZnO/polycarbonate, ZnO/isotactic polypropylene, Ag/OMteLDPE, and Ag/poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-18 mol%-3-hydroxyvalerate) are also used specifically for food packaging applications (He and Hwang 2016). Polystyrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and poly(vinyl chloride) are also reported along with chitosan, as nanocomposite films, which binds to Cu or ZnO nanomaterials to control the growth of food pathogens or inactivate these (Li et al. 2009).",

SiO2-gallic acid nanoparticles were also developed, and these were tested as antioxidant with its scavenging capacity of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals (Deligiannakis et al. 2012). Browning of fresh-cut fruits is another problem, which can be controlled by the application of antioxidant treatments in association with edible coating, because browning of fresh-cut fruits is an undesirable effect due to conversion of phenolic compounds into some dark-colored pigments in the presence of oxygen (air), during storage and marketing (Garcia and Barrett 2019). But only some applications of nanomaterials directly as anti-browning agents have been known.

An active system involving moisture scavenging has been quite commonly used particularly for packaging of dried and moisture-sensitive foods, while oxygen scavengers are normally inserted into the package in the form of small sachets just to reduce the oxygen level within the package, because an environment free from oxygen prevents oxidation of food as well as the growth of aerobic bacteria and mold.

It includes time-temperature indicators (TTIs), ripeness indicators, biosensors, and radio frequency identification. Such smart devices may be either incorporated in package materials itself or these are attached inside or outside of a package (Kerry et al. 2006; Yam et al. 2005; Kerry and Butler 2008). Smart packaging either responds to change in environmental conditions, repairs, or alerts the consumer about such contamination and/or the presence of some harmful pathogens. It is capable of detecting spoilage of food and release nanoantimicrobes to extend shelf life of food, so that supermarkets can keep their food materials even for a longer time periods before it is sold. Nanosensors are used as tiny chips invisible to the human eye, embedded into food products that act as electronic barcodes (Sekhon 2010).",

These consist of nanofilters, which can filter microorganisms and sometime even viruses. In some experiments, color was successfully removed from beetroot juice, but the flavor is not affected. Similarly red wine was turned into colorless or white in color. Lactose can also be filtered from milk, and it is replaced with some other sugar so that milk can be used by the lactose intolerant also. Nanoceramic particles are used for clustering of dirt molecules, so as to keep cooking oil fresh (Llobet et al. 2007; Wooster 2010). Nanotechnology has proved it worth in food safety by developing highly sensitive and low-cost nanosensors, which can respond to changes in environmental conditions during storage, degradation products, or contamination by microbes. Such nanosensors can be effectively used in packaging materials (Bouwmeester et al. 2014; Liao et al. 2005).",

(2014) reported that CNTs infused with polyethylene films can be used for the packaging of Mazafati dates, which can prevent fungal invasion up to 90 days. Carbon nanotubes have also been developed in packaging to pump out carbon dioxide or absorb undesirable flavors (Sinha et al. 2006). It has been known that CNTs also have antibacterial properties, which may be due to their direct penetration through microbial cells (Sharma et al. 2017). It has been reported that antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles against E. coli and B. cereus spores is significantly enhanced in combination with titanium dioxide and carbon nanotubes, respectively (Krishna et al. 2005). Ionic nanocomposites of carbon ceramic electrode with multiwalled carbon nanotubes may be used for the electrochemical determination of the adulterants in food and beverages such as food dyes, like sunset yellow, tartrazine, etc. In addition, carbon nanotubes have many other properties that may be exploited later on to develop the next generation of nanosensors. An important role is played by CNTs in food packaging and processing, but there may be some pitfalls, like these may migrate into food and contaminate it and can lead to toxic effects in human beings. The toxicity levels of CNTs are considerably high, and therefore, their use is limited.",

Its large production may fulfill current requirements, and it is low cost (Gonera and Cornillon 2002), but it cannot form films with appropriate mechanical strength for a packaging material. So, it is first plasticized or chemically modified. It is converted to a thermoplastic material on treating in an extruder by application of both thermal and mechanical energy. Plasticizers play an important role in efficiently reducing intramolecular hydrogen bonds and also provide stability to properties of product, when thermoplastic starches are produced. Hence, there are ample opportunities that thermoplastic starches may be used as packaging material (Kim and Pometto 1994).",

Presently, polylactic acid is the polymer, which has the highest potential as renewable packaging material, and it is commercially produced on major scale because lactic acid, a monomer of PLA, is easily produced by fermentation of carbohydrate feedstock (biomass). This feedstock can be obtained from a variety of agricultural products like wheat, maize, molasses, and whey. Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) polymer was evaluated for its use as a material for antimicrobial food packaging (Jin and Zhang 2008). They incorporated nisin in PLA films for controlling foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial activity of PLA/nisin films was evaluated in liquid foods (orange juice and liquid egg white) against Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella Enteritidis. Ramos et al. (2014) prepared nano-biocomposite films based on polylactic acid by incorporating thymol (as the active additive) and modified montmorillonite (D43B) at two different concentrations. It was observed that thermal stability was not significantly affected by the addition of thymol, but the incorporation of D43B improved its mechanical properties and reduced the oxygen transmission rate by the formation of intercalated structures. It was suggested that the formulated nano-biocomposites could be considered a potential antioxidant active packaging material.",

This biopolyester may also find industrial applications easily because of its biodegradability and biocompatibility (Van der Walle et al. 2001). Poly(lactic acid) and poly(hydroxybutyrate) were blended and plasticized by Arrieta et al. (2014) with a natural terpene D-limonene (LIM) so as to increase PLA crystallinity and to also obtain flexible films for food packaging applications. As-prepared materials were melt-blended and processed in transparent films. Disintegrability under composting conditions was also worked out, and it was reported that PHB delays the PLA disintegrability, but on the contrary, D-limonene speeds it up. Ma et al. (2018) developed poly(lactic acid)-poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PLA-PHB) based films containing bioactive elements and prepared seven formulations containing different contents of plasticizers (mono-caprylin glycerate (GMC) or glycerol monolaurate (GML)). Two formulations (PLA-PHB-based films with 0.5% GMC or GML) were selected, and 5% cinnamaldehyde was added into each of these. It was revealed that PLA-PHB-based films possessed better mechanical properties and better active properties on application to high lipid food simulant. This study showed that it is possible to use biodegradable active packing as an alternative to replace nonbiodegradable packaging for chilled salmon.",

It has some interesting applications in the fields of medical and agricultural areas (Nakayama et al. 1997). It has high elongation at break and low modulus. Apart from it, its physical properties and availability on commercial scale made it very attractive material for commodity applications. An antimicrobial nanopackaging was developed by Ahmed et al. (2019) for food application by incorporating zinc oxide nanoparticles and clove essential oil (CEO) into polylactide/polyethylene glycol polycaprolactone (PLA/PEG/PCL) blend. Here, CEO acts as an efficient plasticizer, which facilitates the chain mobility in the blend, as evident from tensile and thermal properties. The efficacy of these composite films was confirmed by using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli inoculated in scrambled egg. It was indicated that the PLA/PEG/PCL/ZnO/CEO film exhibited the highest antibacterial activity during 21 days storage at 4 \u00b0C. Cesur et al. (2018) prepared antimicrobial and biodegradable food packaging films with polycaprolactone (PCL). The 0.4 wt% of organo nanoclay (C) and 25, 50, 75 wt% chitosan (K) and glycerol monooleate (GMO) or oleic acid (OA) as a plastifier (5, 10, 20, and 30 wt%) were added, and 12 polymeric composite films were prepared. The samples were coded as PCL (P), organo nanoclay (C), oleic acid (O), and glycerol monooleate (G). The antimicrobial properties of these films were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. Polycaprolactone (PCL)/starch/pomegranate rind (PR) hybrids were developed by Khalid et al. (2018) for antimicrobial packaging applications. PR was used as an antimicrobial compound, and it was incorporated directly in PCL matrix, without the extraction of any active compound from the fruit rind. It was revealed that PCL/PR films show reasonably good antimicrobial activity at higher concentrations. Addition of starch was found to enhance the antimicrobial activity of PR. As all the materials used here are biodegradable and food contactable, it has been suggested that the as-developed material could be used as food-grade antimicrobial packaging material.",

Silver nanoparticles are used for their antimicrobial effects in certain types of food containers by some manufacturer in the United States such as Kinetic Go Green basic nanosilver food storage container, Oso fresh food storage container, and FresherLonger\u2122 Plastic Storage bags. It is also possible that some of these silver nanoparticles may migrate into foods from these containers and they could be ingested by humans (Echegoyen and Nerin 2013). Emamifar et al. (2011) prepared nanocomposite LDPE films containing Ag and ZnO nanoparticles via melt mixing in a twin screw extruder. Orange juice was sterilized and then inoculated with 8.5 log cfu/mL of Lactobacillus plantarum. They filled packages prepared from nanocomposite films with orange juice and then stored at 4 \u00b0C. Microbial stability of the juice was evaluated after 7, 28, 56, 84, and 112 days of storage. It was reported that microbial growth rate significantly reduced on using this nanocomposite packaging material. A potential role of quantum sensors (QS) in food spoilage and food safety has been indicated (Naik and Kowshik 2014). Anti-QS materials like ATNPs were proposed as efficient models for controlling spoilage of food. Incorporation of ATNPs in food packaging materials could play an important role in preservation of food and ensure its safety by prolonging their shelf life. They proposed ATNPs as QS inhibitors with their potential use as an antipathogenic but nontoxic bioactive material. Ag/TiO2-SiO2-coated food packaging film was developed also (Peter et al. 2015). Its ability to inactivate Botrytis cinerea was evaluated during the storage of fresh lettuce. Packaging film was prepared by coating the Ag/TiO2-SiO2 ethanol suspension on polyethylene film. As-prepared packaging film was used for storage of green lettuce in a vegetation room. It was revealed that the shelf life of the lettuce stored in single- and double-layer film modified with TiO2 was extended by 4 and 2 days, respectively. It was revealed that the spoilage of the lettuce in double-layer film modified with Ag/TiO2-SiO2 was lower after 5 days of storage than that of the lettuce stored in film modified with ethanol and unmodified film. Microbiological and chemical characteristics of white bread during storage in paper packages modified with Ag/TiO2\u2013SiO2, Ag/N\u2013TiO2, or Au/TiO2 have been investigated (Peter et al. 2016). The whiteness and the water retention of the modified packages were found to be slightly superior. The water retention was also observed to be very good, especially for the Ag/TiO2\u2013SiO2 paper. These improvements can be associated with the high specific surface area and with the low agglomeration tendency of Ag nanoparticles in comparison with the Au ones. Their use extends the shelf life of bread by 2 days except Au/TiO2 as compared with the unmodified paper package.",
