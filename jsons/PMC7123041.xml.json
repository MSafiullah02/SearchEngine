One interesting aspect for the theories in this book is that the H1N1 pandemic was also taken as a model by economists to describe the crisis of liquidity triggered off when the speculative bubble of the US real estate market burst. From then on, the epidemic spread of some infectious diseases, especially in the light of the mechanisms of contagion, has become a paradigm for economists wishing to describe financial crises.",

For example, as early as 1997, the devaluation of the Thai baht had given rise to a progressive destabilisation of the markets in South-East Asia, which then spread to Latin America, then Russia and finally to the United States, in exactly the same way as an epidemic. This crisis had coincided with the spread of another epidemic virus, the H5N1, known as the bird flu virus and which had also started in South-East Asia.",

Both episodes had some structural characteristics in common, which could be described with equations and which were the consequence of the \u201cstress of a complex, adaptive network\u201d.",

In particular, the theoretical physicist Robert May, well known for his work with the epidemiologist Roy Anderson of Imperial College, proposed an ecological approach to reform the banking system: in ecosystems characterised by complex interactions, the bonds that connect different species (e.g. men, birds and pigs) can trigger off moments of severe instability; similarly, mergers and perturbations in the financial system can spark off uncontrollable chain reactions.",

When the (Republican) Mayor Bloomberg legislated on the portions of sugary drinks and prohibited trans-fatty acids in New York, criticism was poured on him by the defenders of individual freedom. To govern the rapid changes in technology and in the models of distribution and consumption, strong public institutions are necessary, but they have never been so discredited and unpopular as today. Today, strong international bodies are needed even more than national states: the agencies that represent public health ought to be more incisive than the WTO (World Trade Organization) when it is a question of legislating on products that are harmful for health like smoking. Research ought to be more incisive than the capacity of industry to confuse public opinion and orient its behaviours.

We cannot rule out that in the future many of the conquests in the health field may be eroded and that we will see a worsening of the state of health of large sectors of the population. The health crisis could be outlined through mechanisms which are not too dissimilar from those that led to the economic collapse: (1) the concentration of capitals in a small number of large corporations (in particular pharmaceutical); (2) a finance-based economy even in the health field, with the propensity to disinvest from the least profitable sectors; (3) sacrificing stable and political institutions that can have both a global and a local impact (as in the case of finance with Bretton Woods and with the guarantee systems that emerged from the Second World War, as explained later); and (4) the growing pressure on States to take on measures limiting expenditure and not to hinder investments and consumption, even though they may be harmful for health.",

After that the rate of improvement slowed down (though life expectancy itself always increased in high-income countries), whilst rapid improvement has moved towards Brazil, Russia, India and China (grouped together under the acronym BRIC). It is likely that the extension of such improvement to Africa, in particular sub-Saharan, will follow with a certain delay. There is a clear parallelism between the time trend of economic indicators and that of the health macro-indicators, in particular of life expectancy. In other words, when the wealth of countries increases, the conditions of health in them also improve. What are the mechanisms underlying this relationship is still unclear, as a debate based on the seminal 1975 paper by Samuel Preston made clear (Bloom and Canning 2007). Preston examined the relationship between life expectancy and income in three different decades, the 1900s, 1930s and 1960s: in each decade the association between the two measures held true. Also more recent research shows that the income\u2013life expectancy relationship still applies and continues to move upwards. One interesting aspect of the debate on Preston\u2019s paper concerns the possibility of a health-to-wealth causal relationship, i.e. not only wealth can lead to better health, but also the reverse may happen, through increased productivity: this could have great repercussions on our idea of health as a common good.",

The island became unexpectedly rich during the 1970s, thanks to the discovery of an enormous deposit of guano which was exploited to sell phosphates, used as fertilisers.

There was no significant change in self-rated health in Greece or Ireland following the onset of the financial crisis. However, a comparison with the control population suggested an increase in the frequency of poor health in Greece, with the effects most pronounced for older individuals and those living in high-density areas. There was apparently no effect of the financial crisis on the frequency of poor self-rated health in Ireland. The comparison is a very early one but leads to an interesting consideration: Ireland was able to get through the crisis without cutting pensions and other segments of the Welfare State in spite of the strong decline in salaries, which might explain the lower impact of the crisis particularly amongst the elderly population. Another interesting observation from the political point of view concerns Iceland: whilst rejecting the economic orthodoxy that advocated austerity, this country invested in social protection instead, apparently with very few adverse health effects of the crisis (Karanikolos et al. 2013).",

Migration has significant consequences for the work of doctors, nurses and public healthcare specialists in the developed countries: migrants, who in increasing numbers are fleeing from poverty, war or the effects of climate change (such as drought or flooding), have specific health problems, which are often difficult to identify and diagnose. The consequences of migration on mental health are particularly important. The high frequency of anxiety and depression amongst migrants can be attributed\u2014along with other reasons\u2014to their difficult economic conditions, to the awareness of the expectations generated in families by migration and to the cultural differences with the host country. A systematic review of literature shows rates of depression equal to 20% amongst migrant workers and 44% amongst refugees, which are very high values if compared with the average rates of the population in general (Lindert et al. 2009). The number of migrants in the world has increased from 150 million in 2000 to 244 millions in 2015 (1 every 33 people).",

Cholera epidemics are also favoured by changes in the quality and temperature of water, which increase the proliferation of the vibrio (Lara et al. 2009). Shrimp farming, which requires high levels of salt in the water, has developed rapidly in Bangladesh and has become a flourishing industry for export, but further worsens the ecological situation as it means that freshwater (in the fields previously used to grow rice) is replaced by briny water which facilitates the proliferation of the vibrio.
