            "text": "An optimal ventilation-to-perfusion (VA/Q) ratio (0.1 < VA/Q < 10) is necessary to ensure a normal gas exchange [2\u20134]. Typically, it has been considered that pulmonary perfusion in ARDS occurs in non-ventilated (VA/Q < 0.005) or poorly ventilated (0.005 < VA/Q < 0.1) lung units, which, in turn, results in vasoconstriction of perfusing arterioles [5]. Such VA/Q mismatch in some lung regions in which perfusion largely exceeds ventilation, account for hypoxemia, which is the clinical hallmark of ARDS [1, 6, 7]. Nevertheless, distribution of ventilation to poorly perfused (10 < VA/Q < 100), severely hypoperfused (VA/Q > 100) or non-perfused (VA/Q ~ \u221e) lung units might also occur in patients with ARDS [3] and indeed, increases in VD/VT have been strongly related with adverse clinical outcomes [8\u201310]. Importantly, high VA/Q and VA/Q ~ \u221e ratios corresponding to lung regions where ventilation largely exceeds perfusion, account for carbon dioxide retention [5]. Increases in high VA/Q and/or dead-space lung units have been classically attributed to alveolar overdistention with the subsequent compression of intra-alveolar vessels in the non-dependent lung areas [8, 11]. Nevertheless, increased dead-space ventilation has also been described in patients subjected to protective ventilation strategies with low plateau pressures [9, 10], which suggest that mechanisms different to alveolar overdistention should be implied.",

Nevertheless, severe inflammation can induce microcirculatory alterations [13, 14] determining alterations in oxygen extraction capabilities by the tissues and contributing to the development of multiple organ dysfunction [14]. Although there are many technical limitations to directly evaluate pulmonary microcirculation [15], heterogeneity of microvascular blood flow at pulmonary level could contribute to imbalances between ventilation and perfusion relationships. Thus, considering microcirculatory dysfunction during inflammatory conditions as a generalized phenomenon, which may involve systemic and pulmonary vascular beds, we hypothesized that alterations in microvascular blood flow distribution evaluated at the sublingual mucosa as representative of an extra-pulmonary territory could be related to variations in dead-space ventilation VD/VT during early phases of moderate and severe ARDS.",

After a 60 min of stabilization period, we started capnography measurements while sublingual microcirculatory images were simultaneously acquired, such as detailed thereafter. A new set of measurements was obtained 24 h after. Arterial and mixed venous blood samples (when available) were drawn for gases analysis (ABL300, Radiometer; Copenhagen, Denmark) at T0 and 24 h after (T24).

Thus, patients were subjected to a stepwise recruitment maneuver with progressive PEEP increases until a peak pressure of 50 cmH2O while maintaining a driving pressure of 15 cmH2O, as described elsewhere [18, 19]. Once obtained the maximal peak pressure, it was sustained during 2 min whereupon a decremental PEEP titration trial was conducted in steps of 2 cmH2O at 2 min interval from 22 to 8 cmH2O registering the corresponding compliance of the respiratory system (CRS). After such a PEEP titration, a new alveolar recruitment was performed until a peak pressure of 50 cmH2O while maintaining a driving pressure of 15 cmH2O during 1 min, to finally adjust the definitive ventilatory settings. Definitive PEEP was set at the corresponding best CRS plus 2 cmH2O. If falls in CRS were observed in two consecutive downsteps, then the PEEP level was set at the highest compliance plus 2 cmH2O. According to the local protocol, the recruitment maneuver was stopped if one or more of following signs were observed: heart rate > 150 or < 60 bpm; decrease of mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg or systolic pressure < 90 mmHg; acute atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia.",

Distribution of ventilation to poorly perfused (10 < VA/Q < 100), severely hypoperfused (VA/Q > 100) or non-perfused, i.e., true dead-space ventilation (VA/Q ~ \u221e) lung units, can also contribute to gas exchange disturbances and it might be a key piece in the pathophysiology of ARDS. Some studies in the past demonstrated the occurrence of increased pulmonary dead-space fraction in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [3, 22, 23], and highlighted the apparent relationship between high VD/VT and increased mortality [8]. Nevertheless, early studies included patients under non-lung-protective ventilation strategies, in which over-inflation leading to capillary collapse could explain VA/Q mismatching with the resultant increased VD/VT [24]. Remarkably, later studies in ARDS patients subjected to lung-protective ventilation, also demonstrated the occurrence of increases in VD/VT and confirmed its consistent relationship with worse clinical outcomes [9, 10, 25]. In agreement with this, we observed increases in VD/VT at baseline and 24 h after in patients with moderate and severe ARDS. Importantly, we did not find any relationship between VD/VT and variables suggesting vascular collapse related to alveolar overdistention or increased pulmonary strain (e.g., VT/CRS), although admittedly, controlling airway pressures and VT/CRS (driving pressure) could not prevent alveolar overdistention because the inhomogeneous lung compromise in ARDS [26].",

Our data suggest an apparent relationship between microcirculatory dysfunction and dead-space ventilation. Admittedly, sublingual mucosa and pulmonary circulation are two dissimilar vascular beds with particular regulating mechanisms. Nevertheless, during inflammatory conditions, microcirculatory dysfunction is a generalized phenomenon involving simultaneously most vascular beds [14], although with different effects depending on the territory studied [27]. Microcirculatory alterations have been described in autopsies and biopsies from lungs of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [28, 29] and angiograms performed through pulmonary artery catheters demonstrated filling defects attributable to macro- and micro-emboli [30, 31]. Increases in VD/VT in our patients were well correlated with alterations in microcirculatory blood flow distribution detected in a non-pulmonary vascular bed. Such observation could pose the hypothesis about heterogeneity of microvascular blood flow contributing to inequalities in VA/Q relationships. Indeed, variations of VD/VT from baseline to 24 h after were closely related with dynamic changes in microcirculatory blood flow distribution at sublingual mucosa, which reinforce the strength of such relation. Nevertheless, whether pulmonary microvascular alterations or other organ-specific microvascular blood flow can be evaluated or estimated through evaluation of an extra-pulmonary microvascular bed can result highly controversial [15].",

However, during inflammatory conditions, heterogeneity of microcirculation increases as consequence of the interruption of blood flow of individual capillaries causing derangements in the oxygen extraction capabilities, thus contributing to organ failure. In agreement with this, we observed important microcirculatory alterations consisting in decreased PPV, reduced FCD and increased heterogeneity of blood flow, which were in turn linked to more severe extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction quantified by SOFA score (see Additional file 1: Table S3).",

An increased VD/VT reflects a global assessment of abnormal gas exchange, but not simply the contribution of discrete high VA/Q regions and true anatomic dead space (VA/Q ~ \u221e). Although the patchy pattern of vascular damage is a phenomenon clearly recognized in ARDS [26], no studies demonstrated that damaged areas necessarily receive substantial ventilation, as would be necessary to explain regions of high VA/Q ratio. Using the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET) to evaluate the fractional contribution of each VA/Q abnormality (shunt, mid-range VA/Q heterogeneity, high VA/Q, and anatomic dead space) on total VD/VT at progressively high PEEP levels, Coffey et al. [33] demonstrated similar VD/VT values at different PEEP levels mediated by very different physiologic abnormalities, although certainly, higher PEEP values were consistently related to high VA/Q peaks. Our results might add more complexity to the pathophysiology on increased VD/VT in ARDS suggesting the contribution of altered microcirculatory blood flow distribution on the increase of high VA/Q units.",

Also, we used a stepwise recruitment maneuver with progressive PEEP increases, which was part of the local protocol at the time in which patients were included.

Second, our study is not able to demonstrate a causal association between VD/VT and sublingual microcirculation and it was not registered as observational study. Nevertheless, dynamic variations from baseline to 24 h after merit exploration in future studies.
