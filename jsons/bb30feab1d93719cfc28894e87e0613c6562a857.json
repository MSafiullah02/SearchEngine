            "text": "In the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area, where the first case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease in the United States was reported (1), a community-level outbreak is ongoing with evidence of rapid spread and high morbidity and mortality among older adults in long-term care skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (2, 3) . However, COVID-19 morbidity among residents of senior independent and assisted living communities, in which residents do not live as closely together as do residents in SNFs and do not require skilled nursing services, has not been described. During March 5-9, 2020, two residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented in the community. UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health -Seattle & King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility. On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later. Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%) had positive test results. The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved. A fourth resident, who had negative test results in the initial phase, had positive test results 7 days later. This resident was asymptomatic on both days. Possible explanations for so few cases of COVID-19 in this residential community compared with those in several Seattle SNFs with high morbidity and mortality include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers. In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting. When investigating a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in senior independent and assisted living communities, symptom screening is unlikely to be sufficient to identify all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Adherence to CDC guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission in senior independent and assisted living communities (4) could be instrumental in preventing a facility outbreak.",

Nasopharyngeal swabs were used to collect specimens from all residents and staff members; SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on specimens. Residents and staff members were also asked to complete a questionnaire assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms during the preceding 14 days; some residents received assistance from staff members to complete the questionnaire. Staff members from all shifts came to the facility for the assessment, including two ill staff members who were tested in their cars. In addition, specimens and symptom questionnaires were collected on March 11 from two residents who had been off-site and from several staff members who had been unable to go to the facility on March 10. All residents were tested again 7 days later; symptom information was not collected at that time, with the exception of symptom ascertainment through follow-up of any resident with a positive test result. Staff members were not retested because they had no new facility exposure to SARS-CoV-2; all residents who had positive test results during the first round were in isolation, and the facility's personal protective equipment protocols* were being followed.

Possible explanations for differences in findings in this residential community from those in SNFs include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers in independent and assisted living communities than that in SNFs. In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus.",

Symptom reports by residents and staff members might have been subject to recall bias, given the general anxiety about COVID-19 in response to the identification of the two initial COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, the high percentage of both residents and staff members who had negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, yet reported symptoms, illustrates the limitations associated with COVID-19 case identification strategies determined by presence of symptoms alone. The findings from this investigation underscore the importance of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation measures, including social distancing, visitor restriction, resident and staff member testing, exclusion of ill staff members, and enhanced disinfection and hygiene practices, which are consistent with current CDC guidance for preventing transmission of COVID-19 in independent and assisted living communities (4).",
