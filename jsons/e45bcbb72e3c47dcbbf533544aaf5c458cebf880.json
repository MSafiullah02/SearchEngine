To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods. Methods: We compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted ARIMA model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period. Results: Between March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1,255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75+. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, The other 51% registered as other natural causes. Conclusion: Even though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75+. Only half of the excess mortality was registered as directly due do COVID-19.",

The economic and social impact of the pandemic could also contribute to long-term EM. 1 According to Johns Hopkins University, by April 15, 2020 , the COVID-19 virus had infected nearly 2 million people and killed more than 128,000 people worldwide. 2 EuroMOMO reports a significant increase in the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in several countries such as Spain and Italy. 3 Other analyzes, for countries like England, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands already presented considerable excess mortality as of 12 April. 4 These values would probably have been much higher if no action had been taken. However, making comparisons between different methods can be challenging, since the methods used and periods considered vary considerably, from study to study.",

This became less of a problem by April, when Portugal adopted a generous testing strategy, including tests in long term care institutions and even at the morgue. Finally, Portugal has an inclusive definition for classifying deaths as due to COVID-19, accepting the diagnosis in the absence of a confirmation test. 17 A study by Rui Santana and collaborators (2020) supports the hypothesis that patients reduced emergency visits, since it showed that, in March 2020, there was a 48% drop in the demand for emergency services and a reduction of more than 144,000 emergency episodes, for patients with a higher priority of care (yellow and red bracelets), when compared to previous years. 18 Some international studies also reported EM by non COVID-19 in different countries and found it varying from 20% to 60%, in Spain, Belgium France, England and Wales, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, which is in line with the results presented in this study. 19, 20 Our study shows EM due to natural causes were superior to total EM. This difference partly explained by a significant reduction in the number of injury related deaths, namely those associated with traffic accidents, due to severe mobility restrictions imposed by the Authorities.. 11",

Our excess mortality estimates are conservative, since expected deaths are influenced by the previous years and the present year registered lower mortality than expected in February and early March. In addition, during the study period there was a significant reduction in the number of injury related deaths, namely those associated with traffic accidents, due to severe mobility restrictions imposed by the Authorities.. 11 The results are also in line with the estimates made by other excess mortality studies carried out in Portugal.
