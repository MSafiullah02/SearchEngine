(1995). To identify viruses in sewage, a variety of specimens (sewage before or after disinfection by chlorine) were inoculated onto Vero E6. All cell cultures were grown in Eagle's growth medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) containing 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.015 M DMEM buffer and antibiotics (50 \u03bcg [each] of kanamycin and gentamycin per milliliter), and maintained in the same medium with 1.5% FBS. For virus propagation and isolation, cell cultures in 75-cm2 flasks were drained of medium, inoculated with 2 ml of sample, and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with periodic rocking for viral adsorption. Because of the toxicity of most sewage, all cell cultures were inoculated in the presence of growth medium. Medium was replaced after 1\u20132 days of incubation. The culture was observed daily for cytopathic effect and terminated 7 days after inoculation. Any cultures exhibiting an identifiable cytopathic effect were subjected to several procedures to identify the cause of the effect (WHO, 2003c, WHO, 2003d, WHO, 2003e). If there was no cytopathic effect in the cell culture, the culture suspensate was harvested and transferred into additional flasks to isolate viruses. The cultures were used for three generations without any observable cytopathic effect.",

These hospitals were specially assigned to receive SARS patients in Beijing. Since f2 is a kind of bacterial virus with a single-positive-stranded RNA (similar to SARS-CoV), and testing f2 was simple and relatively inexpensive (Olivieri et al., 1975), f2 was chosen as a model for SARS-CoV to evaluate the concentration efficiency. Because most enteroviruses can also grow on the Vero cell, and yield a cytopathic effect similar to that of the SARS-CoV, enteroviruses must be first excluded from all the viruses that can grow on the Vero cell culture or yield a cytopathic effect.",

We expected that if the assays were initiated with sewage samples collected when patients were in the early, acute phase of SARS the infectious virus could be isolated. The patients in these hospitals were all beyond the acute phase, and most had recovered from SARS. The following reasons may be responsible for the negative results: (1) the SARS-CoV was inactivated by the high concentration of disinfectants, which were used after a patient had a bowel movement; (2) the quantity of SARS-CoV was too low to be detected by the current methods; (3) SARS-CoV may become non-infectious by unknown factors during the concentration process.",

After disinfection, SARS-CoV RNA could only be detected from the samples collected on 11, 13 and 15 June 2004, from the 309th Hospital. It is interesting that, after disinfection, the RNA of SARS-CoV could be detected in the samples from the 309th Hospital but not from Xiao Tang Shan Hospital. It is possible that the RNA originated from two serious patients who had been moved to other hospitals in Beijing on 2 and 9 June, respectively, before the experimental period. It has been reported that the RNA of SARS-CoV can survive for five days or longer (AGIFMP, 2003). In this study, the RNA could be detected in sewage for 8 days, though the virus itself was inactive.",
