The model adapted and synthesised theories from the Heuristic Systematic Model of Information Processing (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993) and proposes that people who engage in more effortful information seeking and processing are more likely to develop risk-related cognitions, attitudes and behaviours that are more stable over time. Some of the key concepts proposed by the model, information sufficiency, perceived hazard characteristics and social trust, provide useful theoretical grounding to facilitate understanding the responses of the survey respondents to the SARS crisis. 'Information sufficiency' is the amount of information people say they need in order to deal adequately with a given risk in their own lives (Griffin et al., 1999) . Information would be pursued and processed until perceived knowledge reaches the sufficiency threshold, which would represent the point at which the individual is confident that he or she can cope behaviourally with the risk (e.g. take effective preventive action). However, people might avoid risk content if, for example, it produces worries with which they cannot cope. Some may not pay attention or simply avoid such information all together. This might explain why while basic knowledge about SARS (e.g. awareness that fever is a symptom of SARS) was high, the overall knowledge score remained low in the study as most Singaporeans may feel that basic knowledge about SARS allows them to cope adequately with the crisis at a personal behavioural level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 75, "text": "(Griffin et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 257, "end": 282, "text": "(Eagly and Chaiken, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 871, "end": 893, "text": "(Griffin et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "'Perceived hazard characteristics' reflect the degree to which a risk is understood and the degree to which it evokes a 'feeling of dread' (Griffin et al., 1999) .

Researchers have identified social trust as a key mediating factor in circumstances requiring collective action (Slovic, 1992; Earle and Cvetkovich, 1994) . Social trust serves as a cognitive heuristic tool that decreases the complexities of social life to workable levels. When people face threatening events or conditions, they often make risk judgements based on social trust, an expectation that assigns to others the responsibility for working on some necessary task (Slovic, 1992; Earle and Cvetkovich, 1994) . It was clear that social trust was rampant during the SARS crisis in Singapore. Singapore has sometimes been described as having a communitarian ideology (Chua, 1995) . State interventions in social life are often viewed as pre-emptive measures for ensuring the collective well-being or as measures of good government. During the SARS crisis, the government actively promoted public confidence in the ability of TTSH to cope with SARS. Several leaders of the country shared their personal views about SARS and expressed confidence in the ability of the hospital to handle the crisis. The 'social norm' (Fishbern and Ajzen, 1975; Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980) of accepting TTSH as being capable of dealing with SARS was further enforced when individuals who did not admit themselves into the hospital when suspected of SARS were publicly criticised.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 185, "text": "(Slovic, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 186, "end": 213, "text": "Earle and Cvetkovich, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 531, "end": 545, "text": "(Slovic, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 546, "end": 573, "text": "Earle and Cvetkovich, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 730, "end": 742, "text": "(Chua, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1204, "text": "Ajzen, 1975;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1230, "text": "Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "As people placed increasing trust in the government, institutions and hospitals to manage SARS, it could have led them to experience less personal worry and perceived vulnerability to SARS. Given the situation that little was known about SARS and that there was constant appeal for people to live life as normally as possible, people tried to manage their lives by reducing complexities through increased social trust, which also implied an expectation on the government to take over the responsibility for fighting SARS. Consequently, they developed high confidence in the measures undertaken by the government, despite having a low level of knowledge about SARS. In summary, the low level of knowledge about SARS and infection control measures may indicate that the information sufficiency threshold is low, meaning Singaporeans need very little information in order to feel confident to cope with SARS or they do not see the need to know all the control measures before feeling confident with what the government is doing to handle the SARS crisis. This is no doubt mediated by the high perceived hazard associated with SARS and the high social trust ascribed to the government. Taken together, these concepts help to explain the apparent disparity between the low knowledge about SARS and the control measures on the one hand, and high confidence in key institutions dealing with SARS, high endorsement about SARS control measures being appropriate and high satisfaction with the government's response to SARS on the other hand.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, some useful lessons can be gleaned from the study. The low knowledge level but high level of trust implies that public compliance is high. While public compliance may be high, it may not necessarily translate to private conviction and conversion about the importance of adopting appropriate preventive measures. However, even though private conversion may be the best societal control in the long-term, high-risk situations require quick short-term measures (Asch, 1955; Moscovici, 1985) , and those taken for SARS were effective and appropriate for Singapore. Taking into consideration the cultural and societal background, instilling public compliance seemed to be an efficient tool of helping to cope with the immediate SARS crisis.

During the initial period of the epidemic, public communication was effected through press releases and media coverage of the epidemic. About a month into the epidemic, a public education campaign was mounted to educate Singaporeans on SARS and adoption of appropriate behaviours to prevent the spread of the disease. A survey was conducted in late April 2003 to assess Singaporeans' knowledge about SARS and infection control measures, and their concerns and anxiety in relation to the outbreak. The survey also sought to assess their confidence in the ability of various institutions to deal with SARS and their opinion on the seemingly tough measures enforced. The study involved 853 adults selected from a telephone-sampling frame. Stratified sampling was used to ensure adequate representation from major ethnic groups and age groups. The study showed that the overall knowledge about SARS and control measures undertaken was low (mean per cent score of 24.5 \u00b1 8.9%). While 82% of respondents expressed confidence in measures undertaken by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the hospital designated to manage SARS), only 36% had confidence in nursing homes. However, \u03fe80% of the public agreed that the preventive and control measures instituted were appropriate. Despite the low knowledge score, the overall mean satisfaction score of the government's response to SARS was 4.47 (out of possible highest score of 5.00), with \u03fe93% of adult Singaporeans indicating that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the government's response to SARS. Generally, Singaporeans had a high level of public trust (satisfaction with government, confidence in institutions, deeming government measures appropriate), scoring 11.4 out of possible maximum of 14. The disparity between low knowledge on the one hand and high confidence and trust in the actions of the government on the other suggests that Singaporeans do not require high knowledge sufficiency to be confident in measures undertaken by the government to control the SARS crisis. declaration cards and travel advisories at the airport and seaports; and (iii) stopping community transmission through education, contact tracing and home quarantine measures. In addition, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) was officially designated as the hospital to manage SARS on 22 March 2003, and strict infection control measures were imposed on all hospitals.
