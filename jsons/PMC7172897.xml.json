The primary line of defense against such pathogens is the activated alveolar macrophage (Beck and Shellito, 1989). Activation of alveolar macrophages (AM) is a biphasic process regulated by a number of cytokines generated by antigen specific T cells (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) and the AM itself (TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL12). Early activation occurs as a result of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 production from NK cells and macrophages. A more sustained activation of AM, which is required for successful control of intracellular pathogens, is dependent upon development of a Th1 immune response (IFN\u03b3 and IL12).",

As both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are produced by activated macrophages, it may be the ratio of the particular cytokines that is important in determining whether macrophages will function properly or not. For example, although low levels of IL12 are constitutively produced by the AM of HIV-infected patients, levels could not be increased following stimulation by Staphylococcus aureus (Denis and Ghadirian, 1994). These data suggest that although AM from HIV-infected patients constitutively secrete cytokines associated with activation, when faced with a secondary infectious agent, the AM cannot reach the level of activation necessary for successful clearance of the organism, possibly due to a failure in mounting a protective Th1 immune response.",

The acute infection is followed by a variably long asymptomatic period characterized by a progressive decrease of CD4+ lymphocytes that results in the hallmark inverted CD4+:CD8+ ratio in the peripheral blood (Bendinelli et al., 1995, English et al., 1994). The asymptomatic period is followed by the development of AIDS-associated disorders, many of which mimic AIDS in humans (Bendinelli et al., 1995, English et al., 1994). Davidson et al. (1993) and Yang et al. (1996) reported that FIV-infected cats challenged with an avirulent strain of T. gondii developed severe respiratory disease resulting in 60\u201380% mortality/euthanasia. The FIV-infected cats developed systemic toxoplasmosis characterized by necrotic/inflammatory foci in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and most severely in the lung. The lesions were accompanied by abundant replication of Toxoplasma tachyzoites readily noticeable in the sites of inflammation. In contrast, FIV\u2212 cats developed only a transient, mild clinical disease characterized by anorexia and lethargy without clinical signs of pulmonary involvement. Levy et al. (1998) examined the peripheral and bronchial lymph nodes from normal and FIV-infected cats following challenge with T. gondii and reported a marked difference in the cytokine profile in the two groups of cats. As compared to control cats challenged with T. gondii, cells harvested from the lymph nodes of FIV-T. gondii co-infected cats produced high levels of IL10 and IFN\u03b3 but were deficient in IL2 and IL12 (p40) mRNA production. Dean and Pedersen (1998) also reported elevated levels of IL10 and IFN\u03b3 mRNA in lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats.",

Lavage was performed in three aliquots through the tube with the cat in left lateral recumbency using a volume of 5 ml/kg body weight of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in each aliquot. The aliquots were pooled, total viable BAL cell counts determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, and differential cell analyses performed on Diff\u2013Quik stained cytospins. Using the differential to determine the numbers of AM per milliliter of BAL fluid, duplicate cultures of AM (along with other contaminating BAL cells) were seeded in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics containing 1\u00d7106\n AM/ml each. Following overnight incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with HBSS. From one culture, adherent cells were dislodged and an aliquot used to verify AM purity, which was always >95% as determined by differential analyses. Remaining cells were lysed and total cellular RNA prepared for quantitation of cytokine gene expression (see below).

Fifty microliters of serial two-fold dilutions of AM cell supernatants were then added in triplicate along with 20 \u03bcl of culture medium containing 8.5 \u03bcg/ml actinomycin D. Serial dilutions of human recombinant TNF\u03b1 (UBI, Lake Placid, NY) of known bioactivity were used as a standard and positive control. Following overnight incubation, 25 \u03bcl of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide at 5 mg/ml in PBS was added to each well. Following a 4 h incubation, all supernatant was removed and 100 \u03bcl of 0.01N HCl in isopropanol was added to each well. After a 30 min incubation, 100 \u03bcl of ddH2O was added to each well and absorbency measured at 570/630 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Units of TNF\u03b1 were determined from a standard curve derived from dilutions of the human recombinant TNF\u03b1 standard. The murine fibroblasts may be either more or less sensitive to feline TNF\u03b1 when compared with the human recombinant standard. Therefore, the values reported are meant for relative comparisons of feline TNF\u03b1 levels between cats and timepoints and are not intended to convey an absolute quantitative measurement.",

Thus, FIV-induced changes in IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression by AM was manifested by a time-related increase in the number of cats expressing IFN\u03b3 mRNA, as well as an increase in the level of expression for individual cats.",

Similarly, increases in distinct cell populations including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages have also been reported in HIV-infected patients, in some cases, without altering the total cell counts (Agostini et al., 1988, Davis et al., 1993). Because the pulmonary neutrophilia was not accompanied by either a systemic neutrophilia, clinical symptoms of illness, or bacterial contamination of the BAL fluid, the neutrophilia is related to FIV infection and not a result of a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Also, as a pulmonary neutrophilia did not develop in the control cats, the neutrophilia observed in FIV-infected cats is not a result of the sequential BAL. A neutrophilia in the BAL population has been reported in cats during the asymptomatic stage (range 8 months to 4 years) of FIV infection (Hawkins et al., 1996) that is similar to the neutrophilia reported in later stages of HIV infection (Agostini et al., 1991b). Cadore et al. (Cadore et al., 1997) also reported a neutrophilic alveolitis in cats naturally infected with FIV and suffering from a number of secondary complications. The mechanism that regulates the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung is most likely the release of macrophage-derived cytokines, perhaps in response to secondary infections. In humans, IL8 and GM\u2013CSF have been found to be increased in patients infected with HIV-1 (Agostini et al., 1992; Denis and Ghadirian, 1994). In this study, we did not specifically evaluate chemokine expression from AM; however, it would not be unreasonable to expect that the constitutive cytokine release exhibited by AM from FIV-infected cats (TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL10, IFN\u03b3) would also include IL8, GM\u2013CSF, and other chemokines.",

Based upon absolute lymphocyte counts, 25% of patients with early HIV infection and 50% of patients with advanced disease show increased numbers of lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ lymphocytes, in the lung (Agostini et al., 1991b). These CD8+ cells are thought to be involved in the host defense mechanism against HIV (Beck and Shellito, 1989).

This could be related to the level of virus expression in the lung of cats versus the expression of viral antigens in the lung of HIV-infected patients. Although this study quantitated FIV-gag mRNA expression in purified AM, determination of actual antigen expression and location within the lung was not performed. While Ma et al. (1995) identified FIV mRNA by in situ hybridization in only a small fraction (1 in 10,000) of the total BAL cell population, studies to determine the extent of FIV antigens present in interstitial lung tissue have not been reported. An alternative possibility is that the CD8+ pulmonary lymphocytosis characteristic of HIV-infected patients is a response to subclinical secondary pulmonary infections that would not occur in FIV-infected SPF cats maintained in isolation facilities. In support of this, Cadore et al. (1997) described an interstitial pneumonitis in cats naturally infected with FIV and suffering from a variety of other infectious disease complications. The pneumonitis was characterized by a neutrophilic and lymphocytic alveolitis. We also have recently observed that FIV-infected cats do have large numbers of activated CD8+ cells in the circulation that are not observed in the lungs unless they are exposed to a secondary pulmonary pathogen. Following exposure of FIV-infected cats to T. gondii, there is a rapid influx (1\u20133 days) of activated CD8+ cells into the pulmonary compartment that is not seen in normal cats challenged with T. gondii (unpublished observations).",

Expression of IL6, IL10, and TNF\u03b1 mRNA was initially upregulated during the acute stage infection and then decreased to near control levels by 16 weeks post-FIV infection. Elaboration of bioactive TNF\u03b1 and IL6 proteins was still evident at 16 weeks post-infection. As this experiment was interrupted at 16 weeks post-FIV infection, it is not known if the low level of constitutive TNF\u03b1 and IL6 activity would remain or eventually return to normal levels. However, Levy et al. (1998) reported elevated expression of TNF\u03b1 mRNA in lymph node cells from FIV-infected cats as long as 12 months post-infection. Alveolar macrophages (AM) from clinically healthy (asymptomatic) or diseased (ARC, AIDS) HIV-infected patients produced constitutive TNF\u03b1 bioactive protein throughout the course of HIV infection (Israel-Biet et al., 1991, Krishnan et al., 1990, Millar et al., 1991). In contrast to the rise and fall of TNF\u03b1, IL6 and IL10 mRNA levels, IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression by AM from FIV-infected cats continued to increase throughout the experiment.",

            "text": "For these experiments, plastic adherence was utilized for purification of AM from other BAL cell populations (eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes). Whereas AM purity was confirmed by differential analysis (at least 95%), there remains a possibility that a cell type other than the AM is responsible for the IFN\u03b3 expression. Contaminating lymphocytes would seem to be the leading candidate; however, lymphocytes were only rarely, if ever, demonstrated on post-plastic adherence differentials. The predominant contaminating cell type were eosinophils. Eosinophils have been demonstrated to elaborate IFN\u03b3 mRNA in some model systems (Woerly et al., 1999); however, the levels of IFN\u03b3 mRNA demonstrated in the purified AM culture were independent of the level (5% or less) of eosinophilic contamination. For this reason coupled with the precedent of macrophage derived IFN\u03b3 in the literature (Munder et al., 1998, Nugent et al., 1985), AM were considered the most-likely source of the IFN\u03b3 mRNA. The increase in IFN\u03b3 mRNA in AM is similar to that reported in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes of HIV-infected patients (Graziosi et al., 1994, Graziosi et al., 1996, Than et al., 1997) and FIV-infected cats (Levy et al., 1998, Dean and Pedersen, 1998). It has yet to be determined if AM from HIV-infected patients constitutively produce IFN\u03b3. If subsequent studies show that the AM is in fact not the source of the IFN\u03b3 mRNA, this should not diminish the fact that significant IFN\u03b3 mRNA levels were only detected in the FIV-infected cats. It is also possible that the increased cytokine production by AM from the FIV-infected cat was due to in vitro manipulation of previously sensitized cells. However, AM from normal cats were collected and cultured in vitro in parallel to those from the FIV-infected cats, supporting our conclusions that the elevated cytokine production in the latter group is due to FIV infection and not an artifact of culture.",

This is somewhat different from HIV infection, where AM exhibit low level constitutive production of IL12 (Denis and Ghadirian, 1994). Despite the constitutive production of IL12, HIV-infected AM stimulated with S. aureus do not increase IL12 production as do control AM (Denis and Ghadirian, 1994). Similarly, Levy et al. (1998) reported that FIV-infected cats co-challenged with T. gondii did not respond with increased IL12 mRNA expression in the lymph nodes, as did T. gondii challenged control cats. Therefore, quantitation of cytokine mRNA expression in the lung and lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats indicate that susceptibility to T. gondii may be due (at least in part) to an inability to generate an IL12-dependent Th1 immune response in the lung. Interestingly, the number of cats in this study without detectable IL12 mRNA expression (9/12 or 75%) correlates well with the expected mortality rate (60\u201380%) previously reported for the FIV-NCSU1-T. gondii co-challenge model (Davidson et al., 1993, Yang et al., 1996).",

The expression of HIV in macrophages and lymphocytes is closely related to cellular activation and cytokine signaling (Kazazi et al., 1992; Poli et al., 1990a, Poli et al., 1990b; Serpente et al., 1992). In this study, FIV-gag expression that increased throughout the experiment did not correlate with TNF\u03b1 or IL6 expression that peaked at 4 weeks post-FIV infection. Interestingly, IFN\u03b3 was the only cytokine that was expressed with kinetics similar to the FIV-gag expression, suggesting that mechanisms regulating expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL6 in AM are different from those regulating IFN\u03b3. Upregulation of cytokines was dependent upon virus replication in AM, as FIV infection of AM in vitro induced cytokine mRNA and protein synthesis, whereas exposure of AM to irradiated virus failed to induce either cytokine mRNA or protein. The progressive increase in virus burden in AM also differs markedly with transient acute stage (2\u20134 weeks) high virus burden in plasma and PBMC (Jeng et al., 1996). This observation supports the conjecture that macrophages may be a major virus reservoir during the asymptomatic stage of infection.",
