The severity of disease, and therefore the degree of economic loss, varies with the nature of the infectious agent and with its interaction with the host. If left uncontrolled, those diseases which are highly infectious spread rapidly and those which cause high levels of mortality or debility in affected livestock can have a severe impact on a country\u2019s economy. Examples of such diseases are foot and mouth disease (FMD), African swine fever (ASF) and avian influenza (AI). More insidious diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis cause chronic production losses. Those infectious diseases of animals which can also cause disease in human beings (zoonoses) may have very significant public health implications, for example, salmonellosis (food poisoning) or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).",

Animal diseases may be spread directly by contact between animals. They may also be spread indirectly on the clothing and footwear of people, vehicles, equipment and feedstuffs which have been contaminated with an infectious agent. Diseases may also be spread by animal products such as meat, meat products, milk, milk products, semen, ova and embryos, which have been either derived from infected animals or contaminated by the infectious agent. Controls are therefore aimed at cutting off these mechanisms of transmission. However, some diseases present particular control problems; for example, FMD may be transmitted through the wind over distances more than 200 kilometres and AI may spread via migratory birds. Other diseases may be transmitted by insect vectors, for example, bluetongue. Some diseases have spillover from wildlife hosts into domestic animals, for example, classical swine fever (CSF) and ASF, where wild boar may provide a reservoir of infection.",

Diseases of concern which were highly infectious or insidious in nature could not be controlled without government intervention, whose objective was to achieve the highest health status of country freedom from disease, eradicating it where possible. Once a control programme was started or disease-free status had been established, prevention of disease introduction became a key policy driver through the imposition of import controls on animals and their products. Animal health controls could therefore act as a barrier to trade.",

However, when the European Economic Community (EEC ) was established in 1958, the animal health status of each of the founding member states, and of those countries of Western Europe that were eventually to form the enlarged EU, varied greatly, as did their approach to control. Initially, member states used their national animal health legislation and controls to guarantee trade in healthy live animals and their products. This required bilateral negotiation where the importing country set the trade requirements. It was therefore possible, under political influence, for veterinary authorities to operate a certain degree of protectionism.",

It is worth noting, however, that the EU legislation on animal health was usually adopted by the Council under Article 37 TEU (consultation procedure). This allowed a more rapid response to an emergency disease situation. However, if food safety or human health is concerned, the European Parliament also played already a primary role in the adoption of legislation under Article 152 TEU (co-decision procedure). The Lisbon Treaty, brought into force on 1 December 2009, extends co-decision to all areas of animal health and welfare legislation. Since 2014, the regulatory committee for animal health and welfare is the Standing Committee on the Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCoPAFF).",

Operators have to notify each movement of live animals to the national competent authority (CA) in the member state of origin of the movement. Before the movement takes place, they have to enter data about the animals, itinerary and transport vehicle into the electronic data system Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). The CA checks the provided notification data, an official veterinarian performs checks at the origin of the consignment prior to its departure to verify that animal health and welfare requirements are met, issues a health certificate in case requirements are met and/or performs non-discriminatory checks of the consignment at destination. The obligations vary depending on the species of animals or their products and the context of the movement. For example, the veterinary check at the location of origin is mandatory for animals moved for slaughter, but not needed in the case of day-old chicks. The costs of these activities related to the animal health check for animals for slaughter and day-old chicks were estimated between \u20ac13 million and \u20ac33 million per year (IBF et al. 2017). These costs are mainly made for pigs and poultry for slaughter and in the Netherlands and Germany, because the majority of consignments in the EU are for these animal species and originate in these member states.",

While a sensible ideal, it will be interesting to see how the politicians in member states are prepared to apply the precautionary principle in the face of a new threat to public health from a disease of animal origin, which causes severe disease or death in human beings.

Part of the identification of animals is the identification and registration of animals at farm level, which is also supported by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) via its cross-compliance mechanism. Veterinary surveillance is an essential component of any animal health strategy. In the case of epidemic diseases such as FMD, early detection is key to rapid implementation of control measures and to limiting the eventual size of an epidemic. In the case of insidious diseases such as salmonellosis, tuberculosis and brucellosis, a programme of laboratory testing is required to detect disease. Surveillance can be costly and hence the strategy requires prioritisation as in pillar 1. The need for each member state to have detailed contingency plans to deal with incursions of animal disease, tested through regular exercises, was a lesson learnt from the FMD crisis of 2001.",

The estimation of effect may require the use of an epidemiological model tailored to the policy intervention or project environment that is analysed (e.g. Bergevoet et al. 2009).

Costs and effects of interventions need to be carefully related to each other, and then proper aggregation of costs and effects need to be accounted for, including discounting (Brent 2003, chapter 6).

As was mentioned before, most of the time the analysis is supported by epidemiological models that simulate expected effects given a specific strategy. Sensitivity analyses in such evaluations should also indicate when an alternative strategy should be preferred. In the ex post monitoring, the main focus could then be to monitor whether key indicators are reaching tipping points so alternative strategies need to be considered. A complicating factor in ex post CE analysis is that the control or context variables are no longer constant (in contrast with ex ante CE analysis using modelling tools in which these variables are controlled), but are changing at the same time as the intervention efforts are made (and maybe in different directions for different member states). As such, this likely affects the linkage between the intervention and the final impact, and for a sound CE analysis the impact of the change in context variables on the programme performance need to be corrected for. The reason why in the literature ex post evaluations are relatively scarce is probably because of the many complexities involved and because CE analysis is especially interesting when comparing different alternatives. Once a strategy is chosen for implementation (as is the case in an ex post situation) comparison with (hypothetical) alternatives (that could have been chosen) is often of less interest.",

Member states benefit from the prioritised and targeted implementation of EU co-funded activities, especially for emergency, eradication, control and monitoring measures for animal diseases and plant pest throughout the Union. The financial solidarity that the CFF provides enables member states to take required actions according to their interests. Otherwise these may have been beyond the (financial) capacity of an individual member state. Moreover, the CFF enables harmonised and robust controls, which satisfy an important need with respect to an effective food safety policy.",

With the new Animal Health Law, which was adopted in 2016, the EU has made a single, comprehensive animal health regulation to further strengthen the enforcement of health standards for the whole agri-food chain. Until April 2019, delegated and implementing acts have been adopted by the Commission to make the new rules applicable. This comprehensive Animal Health Law also aims to support the EU livestock sector in its quest towards competitiveness and safe and smooth EU market of animals and of their products.",
