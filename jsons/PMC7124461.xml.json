On arrival, the officer found a man lying on his back, not breathing and without a pulse. One officer observed blood on the walls and floor of the hallway. There were no obvious signs of violence. The local rescue unit and the state police were summoned. The officer started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the others cordoned off the area. The patient was transported by ambulance to the hospital, and the officers secured the area as a crime scene until notified by the hospital, 3 hours later, that the man had died from natural causes. The officers cleaned the area with bleach and a biohazard clean-up kit, and the man\u2019s room was padlocked.",

The postmortem examination of lung tissue identified Mycobacterium tbcomplex, which was susceptible to all first-line drugs, e.g., rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin. A contact investigation was launched immediately.",

The resort management worked closely with the county nurses to be sure that complete and accurate information was available for the investigation. The resort is located in a sparsely populated area north of New York City. Service worker staff for resorts of this type frequently have ties to New York City and travel to area resorts for seasonal jobs. These employees often live in housing available right on the resort grounds and include a high proportion of foreign-born individuals who often are not fluent in English. Foreign-born staff in this investigation came from 17 countries outside the United States, many of which were Central or South America; however, other countries of origin included China, former Soviet Union, and Indonesia. Language barriers were addressed through existing staff at the local health unit and the use of commercially available telephone-based translating services.",

Individuals with latent TB infection were prescribed 6 months of isoniazid treatment (the recommended regimen at the time). Fifty-four individuals were recommended for treatment, and 46 accepted and started the medication.

Individuals born outside of the United States in countries where there is a high prevalence of TB are at risk for developing active TB after immigrating to this country. Follow-up of these individuals can be challenging because of their fear of interaction with government agencies, lack of access to health care, cultural beliefs and practices, and language barriers, etc.",

Among the close contacts there was a high proportion of foreign-born individuals (71%). Many of those people were from high-prevalence countries in Central and South America. 14 The second complicating factor is that the index patient had advanced TB. Given the advanced stage of disease and his history of frequent coughing, the patient may have been capable of transmitting infection for quite some time. Therefore, although some of the first-round TST-positive individuals may have been infected before coming into contact with the patient, others may have been infected by the patient months earlier and had already converted their skin test at the time of first-round testing.",

Tuberculosis has not gone away. Some people still die of TB and completely bypass detection until a postmortem examination. Other TB patients are identified but still die from the disease alone or in conjunction with comorbid conditions. As national attention is drawn to anthrax, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, TB cannot be ignored because it is still an important personal and public concern. The epidemiology of TB may have changed with shifting immigration patterns and the impact of HIV-related diseases. However, older, nonminority individuals are still dying from TB, and although fatalities may be comparatively rare events, TB should be considered in a differential diagnosis of patients with the characteristics previously described.",
