However, the Ebola experience demonstrated the feasibility of rigorously evaluating therapeutic measures during an epidemic [14], and the evaluation of Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19 is by no means an exception. Indeed, in the case of COVID-19 where experimental infection could not be used to facilitate the conduct of randomised trials, the current outbreak provides the only opportunity for evaluating the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine. It is now the prime time to start randomised trials as the peak of the epidemic has pasted in China [15], and the healthcare system has more capacity to plan for evaluation. In fact, on 3 February 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology has launched a clinical research programme on integrative medicine treatment for COVID-19, in which COVID-19 treatment centres in Hubei, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Guangdong will participate [16].",

Shanghai, Henan and Chongqing decided to develop their own Chinese herbal medicine treatment scheme [17].

Additional research investment in terms of resources and personnel will enable the immediate systematic collection of data on outcomes which could later be shared across centres in a coordinated manner. Such data are expected to provide an insight as to how TCM interventions impact prognosis. Besides, they will help identify which promising Chinese herbal medications should be prioritised for further assessment in randomised trials. Since Chinese herbal medicine has already been widely prescribed across the nation, an efficacy-driven approach could be adopted, focusing on phase II or III randomised trials.",
