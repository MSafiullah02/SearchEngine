However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable.",

We also modelled an \"on-off\" strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism.",

Any decision to begin easing lockdown measures will require constant monitoring and a high-level of population 285 testing to track the likely rise towards a second-peak of infections. We show that employing a gradual release strategy, where 286 groups of the population are slowly released from quarantine sequentially, will slow the arrival of any subsequent infection 287 peaks compared to an on-off strategy, where lockdown is ended for all individuals imminently and reinstated when subsequent 288 infections begin to increase. In all considered instances (i.e. parameter variations), it will not be possible to end lockdown 289 for the entire population for any longer than two weeks, as the number of infected individuals is then expected to quickly 290 overwhelm the health service following such a release. By ensuring that the increase in the number of infected individuals is as 291 slow as possible, this will enable health officials to monitor more accurately the evolving situation, and provide more time to 292 respond to unexpected increases in the number of infected individuals. We note that our approach does not consider the ethical 293 responsibilities that will also impact any policy decision. If enough hospital provision was available, many more people can 294 return to employment, but we recognise this will result in increased risk of further mortalities. As many governments state 295 however, a functioning economy is more able to provide health provision to those with non-COVID19 life-threatening illness.",

The rest of the population may then be released three 299 to four months later following a likely second peak in infections. Again, in a general context, it is optimal to wait for one-to-two 300 weeks after the end of an infection peak before releasing any of the population from lockdown. While it is desirable to return 301 the population to work as early as possible, our optimal calculation states that this one-to-two week \"wait\" period is crucial in 302 ensuring that the number of infected individuals is as low as possible when ending any lockdown measures, to reduce the growth 303 of new cases. After this sufficient, cautious, wait period has ended, people should then be released from quarantine, with the 304 knowledge that as many as 1 in 100 of them (under the worst-case scenario) may require critical care 10 in the coming months. 305 It is expected that a second peak in infections may be observed one to two months after this release date, and that the remaining 306 population in quarantine should remain so until, once again, several weeks of low newly infected cases daily have been observed.",

The optimum solution was found for a range of different values of \u03b2 , c and I thresh .Figure 5we see that, in all scenarios, it is never optimal to leave the entire population out of quarantine for long. Notably,267    we see in every instance that the optimum solution results in quarantine only being lifted for periods of 1-2 weeks. This 268 presents a very narrow window of time to be able to monitor the rise in infections. There was no distinguishable change 269 in dynamic behaviour between the different parameters sampled.

Plots a) to c) show the total quarantined population, displaying when releases and re-entry to quarantine are made. Plots d) to f) depict the associated total infected population (I + I Q ) associated with each optimum release strategy. the disease required the initial quarantine to be ended later, and for subsequent quarantines to be enforced for a longer271 duration. All optimum solutions do however result in rapidly increasing herd immunity by moving a large number of individuals 272 to the recovered class. This difference can be seen by noting the difference in timescale on the horizontal axes of Figures 4 and 5. 273 274 Just as with the gradual release strategy, total sensitivity indices were calculated via the same method for our optimum 275 on-off strategy. In descending order, and for the on-off strategy, these now become: \u03b3 : 0.6371, I thresh : 0.3775, \u03b2 : 0.2973, \u03c3 : 276 0.2821, c : 0.0478, \u03b1 : 0.0045. We see that the order of sensitivity is roughly the same as for the gradual release strategy, 277 however all values (except for \u03b2 ) show increased sensitivity on the optimal result. The impact of the incubation period is the 278 most substantially different, and this is due to the shorter durations of time people are out of quarantine in the optimum solution, 279 meaning small changes to the incubation period may have large unexpected impacts on the surge in infected individuals.",
