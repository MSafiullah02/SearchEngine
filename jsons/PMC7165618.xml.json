Ubiquitin is conjugated through the sequential action of three components: E1 ubiquitin activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and finally E3 ubiquitin ligases, which provide for specificity. Polyubiquitin chains are formed through the serial addition of ubiquitin molecules linked to lysine residues in the preceding ubiquitin. A total of seven internal lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) allows for diversity of chain configurations.",

Innate or acquired resistance frequently occurs through up\u2010regulation of other signalling pathways (such as the Met pathway in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors (91, 92)) or downstream activating mutations.

AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) is a member of the JAMM family of metalloproteases with specific activity against K63 ubiquitin linkages (60, 96, 97). Knockdown of AMSH leads to an increased degradation rate of activated EGFR (60, 98). A working model to explain this observation suggests that AMSH deubiquitination of receptors at the sorting endosome leads to their recycling to the plasma membrane (60, 99). Thus, a balance between ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating activity will control receptor fate. Interestingly, in a review of the Oncomine database, AMSH expression was found to be elevated in lung, liver, bladder and colon cancer, consistent with a tumour promoting potential that may correlate with its endocytic function.",

Early work into its aetiology led to the discovery of CYLD, a member of the USP class of DUBs (103). Inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, cylindromatosis has been shown to be due to mutations in the cyld gene. Individual tumours are characterised by loss of heterozygosity whereby the second copy of cyld is mutated and non\u2010functional. The majority of mutations that have been described affect the catalytic domain (104, 105). A second familial condition, trichoepithelioma, is also caused by CYLD mutations, identical to those causing cylindromatosis but resulting in tumours of the hair follicle rather than the sebaceous gland as occurs in cylindromatosis. Malignant transformation in both conditions is very rare but has been described (106, 107).",

Receptor stimulation leads to activation of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, (comprising two catalytic subunits and the regulatory protein NEMO), which in turn phosphorylates I\u03baB. Phosphorylated I\u03baB dissociates from NF\u2010\u03baB, undergoes K48 polyubiquitination and is degraded by the proteasome leaving NF\u2010\u03baB to activate downstream proliferative signals (114). Several proteins involved in signal transduction (NEMO, TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and TRAF6)), are modified by the addition of K63 linked polyubiquitin chains, which results in their activation. CYLD shows preferential activity for K63\u2010linked polyubiquitin chains and its expression is upregulated by NF\u2010\u03baB, providing negative feedback regulation of this pathway through deubiquitination of NEMO, TRAF2, and TRAF6 (109, 110, 115, 116). CYLD has also been shown to deubiquitinate (and inactivate) the coactivator BCL\u20103 (117), which switches the transcriptional properties of NF\u2010\u03baB from repressive to activating, and is known to strongly promote cell proliferation and oncogenesis (118, 119). Recently, I\u03baB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03f5), an oncoprotein overexpressed in 30% of breast cancers (120), which plays a critical role in interferon signalling pathways, has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate CYLD (121). Significantly inactivation of CYLD was necessary for IKK\u03f5\u2010driven transformation (121).",

Whilst in the latter cases, CYLD may function as a positive regulator of mitogenic and motogenic processes, it is loss of function that is more commonly associated with tumourigenesis and correlates with its negative role in the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. There have been several reports of down\u2010regulation of CYLD expression in cancer including lung (56), liver (57) and colon (57) cancer and multiple myeloma (58). Reduced expression has also been correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma (59).

A member of the OTU class of DUBs, A20 exerts its regulatory activity through the removal of activating K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF6 and Ral interacting protein 1 (RIP1) (127, 128). CYLD and A20 target an overlapping set of NF\u2010\u03baB pathway effectors (e.g. TRAF6, RIP1, NEMO) and it has been proposed that CYLD may largely be responsible for the constitutive inactivation of the cascade, whilst A20 protein levels and activity are induced in response to a negative feedback mechanism (112, 113). In vitro, A20 is only poorly active towards free K63\u2010 compared with K48\u2010linked ubiquitin chains, but instead has been shown to remove these chains en bloc from TRAF6 (129, 130). A20 has also been reported to possess E3\u2010ligase activity, which adds K48\u2010linked chains to RIP1 and TRAF6, although this function of A20 may also involve the E3\u2010ligase ITCH (131). Thus A20 can edit ubiquitin chain modifications by co\u2010ordinating removal of one type of ubiquitin chain (K63) promoting NF\u2010\u03baB activation from RIP\u20101 and its replacement with K48\u2010linked ubiquitin chains specifying degradation. A20 is frequently inactivated in B\u2010cell lymphomas (132, 133), and its restoration in A20 null cell lines leads to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis (132). These studies establish A20 as an important tumour suppressor in lymphoid malignancies.",

Signal transduction in this pathway is primarily mediated by the SMAD effectors, and both SMADs as well as the TGF\u00df receptors are regulated by reversible ubiquitination (137). USP9X (also called FAM) was identified as a positive regulator of TGF\u00df signaling by means of a siRNA screen. It acts by removing monoubiquitin from the Co\u2010SMAD, SMAD4, thereby permitting its association with phospho\u2010SMAD2 and subsequent activation of TGF\u00df/SMAD\u2010responsive gene targets (31).

WNT signaling increases the stability of \u00df\u2010catenin by promoting its dissociation from the Axin/GSK\u20103/APC complex. This allows \u00df\u2010catenin to enter the nucleus and activate TCF/Lef family transcription factors to promote specific gene expression. A siRNA screen of human DUBs identified USP4 as a suppressor of \u00df\u2010catenin dependent transcription, possibly through direct deubiquitination of the transcription factor TCF4 (14). USP15, a COP9 signalosome associated paralogue of USP4, has also been implicated as a negative regulator of this pathway by stabilizing the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), thereby promoting the degradation of \u00df\u2010catenin by the proteasome (37). In contrast to USP4 and USP15, the Otubain DUB, TRABID (TRAF\u2010binding protein domain, also called ZRANB1) is a positive regulator of WNT signaling. It interacts with and deubiquitinates APC without affecting its stability, in line with its demonstrated specificity for K63\u2010linked polyubiquitin chains (86, 97). TRABID is required for TCF\u2010mediated transcription in cells with high WNT activity, including colorectal cancer cell lines in which it may affect assembly or activity of the TCF/\u00df\u2010catenin transcription complex (86).",

The role of USP7 in p53 regulation is complex, as USP7 deubiquitinates both p53 and the E3 ligase MDM2 (murine double minute 2 homolog), which itself ubiquitinates and downregulates p53. Thus USP7 would be posited to have opposing effects depending on whether it predominantly deubiquitinates and rescues p53 or MDM2. Current evidence is that USP7 preferentially binds and deubiquitinates MDM2, thereby leading to increased degradation of p53, and consequent anti\u2010apoptotic functions. In this scenario USP7 can be considered to be an oncogene (144). However, there may be situations in which the balance is reversed and USP7 stabilises p53 and acts as a tumour suppressor. For example, USP7 has been proposed to switch from MDM2 to p53 stabilisation in response to DNA damage and subsequent activation of the kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) (145). Other DUBs also influence p53 stability including USP2, which is described further below (9).",

Possibly the second most important tumour suppressor after p53, PTEN is mutated in a wide range of malignancies. Interestingly, nuclear exclusion of PTEN has been shown to result in a more aggressive phenotype in malignancies (147, 148, 149), although the tumour suppressive functions of nuclear PTEN remain unclear (150). Monoubiquitination of PTEN promotes its shuttling into the nucleus where it is sequestered in PML bodies. USP7 in turn deubiquitinates PTEN and promotes its exclusion from the nucleus (24). The same study also showed overexpression of USP7 in prostate cancer with associated nuclear exclusion of PTEN.",

MYC is a transcription factor that binds to \u223c10\u201315% of the genome and acts as a core regulator of cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis (157). MYC is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded leading toa short half\u2010life and thereby allowing exquisite control of its cellular level (158). Although mutations affecting phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of MYC have been described, stabilisation of MYC may also occur in the absence of mutations. Identified through a large\u2010scale shRNA screen, USP28 has recently been shown to control the stability of MYC by antagonising the activity of the SCFFBW7 ubiquitin ligase (48). Significantly, shRNA knockdown of USP28 led to a decrease in MYC in all members of a panel of cancer cell lines, and an associated inhibition in growth. The authors also demonstrated increased expression of USP28 in a significant proportion of colon and breast carcinomas. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which cancer cells may upregulate MYC. USP28 may well prove amenable to inhibition and provide a means of targeting malignancies in which MYC is up\u2010regulated. In a different study, however, USP28 was shown to stabilise Chk2 and p53 binding protein1 (53BP1) in response to DNA damage and was required for DNA damage induced apoptosis (49). USP28 inhibition may therefore be expected to result in significantly different outcomes, depending on which pathways are activated.",

Although the data described earlier indicate important roles for UCHL1 in malignancy, the mechanism by which this occurs remains uncertain. Structural analysis indicates a prominent loop covering the active site (169), thereby preventing the binding of large protein substrates and limiting activity to small peptide chains (170).

Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) promotes DNA repair through chromatin association and enhanced recruitment of enzymes involved in translesion synthesis respectively. In a siRNA screen, Nijman et al identified USP1 as a novel regulator of FANCD2, with USP1 inhibition leading to accumulation of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 (5). Whilst both FANCD2 and PCNA (6) are substrates of USP1, only deubiquitination of FANCD2 is necessary for DNA repair (175), reflecting the need for a dynamic population of FANCD2. Significantly, USP1 knockout mice exhibit a similar, albeit more severe, phenotype to most FA mouse models, with stunted growth, chromosomal instability and sensitivity to DNA cross\u2010linking agents (176).
