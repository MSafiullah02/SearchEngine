Along the fringes of the population novel structures are produced by mutation at a constant rate (Huynen, 1996) . Fast diffusion together with perpetual innovation makes these landscapes ideal for evolutionary adaptation (Fontana and Schuster, 1998) . The 'classical' definition of secondary structures incorporates a quite restrictive condition on the set of base pairs that implies a tree-like arrangement of the doublehelical regions, see Fig. 1 . Additional interactions between different branches of this tree are referred to as pseudo-knots (for an exact definition see Section 2). Pseudoknots are excluded from many studies for a mostly technical reason (Waterman and Smith, 1978a, b) : the folding problem for RNA can be solved efficiently by dynamic programming (Waterman and Smith, 1978b; Zuker and Sankoff, 1984) in their absence.",

            "text": "On the other hand, an increasing number of experimental findings, as well as results from comparative sequence analysis, suggest that pseudo-knots are important structural elements in many RNA molecules (Westhof and Jaeger, 1992) . Notably, Figure 1 . The contact structure of Escherichia coli RNAse P RNA contains two pseudoknots [http://jwbrown.mbio.ncsu.edu/RNaseP/home.html]. The conventional secondary structure is drawn on the l.h.s., the (four) regions forming the pseudo-knots are marked by braces, interaction regions are connected. The arc diagram of the same structure is obtained by arranging the backbone along a line and indicating base pairs by arcs connecting the corresponding bases. The base pairs of the conventional secondary structure are drawn above the line, the two pseudo-knot stems are shown below the back-bone. For details see Section 2. functional RNAs such as RNAseP RNA (Loria and Pan, 1996) and ribosomal RNA (Konings and Gutell, 1995) contain pseudo-knots. The diversity of molecular biological functions performed by pseudo-knots can be subdivided into three groups. Pseudo-knots at the 5 -end of mRNAs appear to adopt a role in the control of mRNA translation. For instance, the expression of replicase is controlled in several viruses either by ribosomal frame shifting (Ten Dam et al., 1990; Brierley et al., 1991; Dinman et al., 1991; Chamorro et al., 1992; Tzeng et al., 1992) or by in-frame readthrough of stop codons (Wills et al., 1991) . Both mechanisms involve pseudo-knots. Core pseudo-knots are necessary to form the reaction center of ribozymes. Most of the enzymatic RNAs with core pseudo-knots, such as RNAseP, are involved in cleavage or self-cleavage reactions (Michel and Westhof, 1990; Forster and Altman, 1990; Brown, 1991; Haas et al., 1991) . Pseudo-knots in the tRNA-like motifs at the 3 -end of the genomic RNA mediate replication control in several groups of plant viral RNA (Mans et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "In Section 2 we review a variety of equivalent graph-theoretical characterizations of bi-secondary structures and provide a way of efficiently determining whether a list of base pairs corresponds to a bi-secondary structure. Then we briefly review a few graph invariants that might be useful for determining the complexity of higher-order structures beyond the realm of bi-secondary structures. At the end of Section 2 we show that a convenient distance measure for comparing secondary structures can be used also in the presence of pseudo-knots (Section 2.7). In Subsection 2.8 we argue that the intersection theorem is valid for general nucleic acid contact structures. We say that an RNA sequence is compatible with a structure s if it can in principle form this structure irrespective of energetic constraints. This means that for each base pair (i, j) in s the sequence positions x i and x j are one of the six possible RNA base pairs AU, UA, GC, CG, GU, or UG. The set of sequences that actually fold into a given structure s is therefore a subset of the set of compatible sequences. The intersection theorem (Reidys et al., 1997) now states that for any two structures s and s there are sequences which are compatible with both of them. This result is the reason why very different structures with very closely related sequences can exist. The fact that the intersection theorem holds for structures with pseudo-knots means that we have to expect shape space covering provided the fraction of neutral mutations is large enough (Reidys et al., 1997) .",

Combinatorial aspects of RNA secondary structures have been studied in detail by Waterman and co-workers (Stein and Waterman, 1978; Waterman, 1978; Waterman and Smith, 1978a, b; Penner and Waterman, 1993; Schmitt and Waterman, 1994; Waterman, 1995) and Hofacker et al. (1999) . Using different techniques we give analytical upper bounds on the number of different bi-secondary structures showing that their number does not increase much faster than the number of secondary structures. The analytical results are complemented by numerical data (see Table 2 at the end of Section 3) indicating that the number S n of 'reasonable' bi-secondary structures with chain length n grows approximately as S n \u223c 2.35 n . 'Reasonable' means here that the structures have no isolated base pairs (i.e., the minimum stack size is l = 2) and that hairpin loops contain at least m = 3 unpaired bases. For comparison, the number of secondary structures without pseudo-knots grows like 1.86 n . Exhaustive enumeration for short sequences suggest that only 1.65 n different secondary structures appear as minimum energy structures of sequences of length n (Gr\u00fcner et al., 1996a) . Hence the number 4 n of RNA sequences of length n, is much larger than the number of possible structures, independent of whether or not one takes pseudo-knots into account.",

A p-book is a set of p distinct half-planes (the pages of the book) that share a common boundary line , called the spine of the book. An embedding of a graph into a book B consists of an ordering of the vertices along the spine of the book together with an assignment of each edge to a page of the book, in which edges assigned to the same page do not cross. The book-thickness (sometimes also called the page-number) bt( ) of a graph is the minimal number p of pages of a book into which it can be embedded (Bernhart and Kainen, 1979) .

We remark that graphs with moderate chromatic numbers can be characterized by results similar to Kuratowski's theorem for planar graphs.

The generalization of this proposition to k > 4 is known as Haj\u00f3s' conjecture. It is false for k \u2265 7 and unsolved for k = 5 and k = 6 (Holton and Sheehan, 1993). It seems that \u03c7( ( )) is in fact the more useful quantity, as there are no efficient algorithms to determine the book-thickness of a given graph, and \u03c7( ( )) accounts for the immutable ordering of the backbone vertices, whereas the book-thickness might decrease by changing this ordering.

Note, however, that must be a 1-diagram, but in addition it might have an arc {k \u2212 1, k} in , as these vertices are separated by the endpoint of the newly introduced arc in the new structure. Viewing this differently, we may either add the arc {1, k} or the -like structure consisting of the arcs {1, k} and {k \u2212 1, k + 1}, which leaves us with a 1-diagram on n \u2212 2 vertices and the same problem.

For instance, most global properties of RNA folding are already present in the 'maximum matching' model, which, instead of an elaborate energy model, simply seeks to maximize the number of base pairs (Tacker et al., 1996) .

The evaluation of loops A and C is straightforward as they contain only a single paired region, namely stack 3. Three stems are contained in loop B; we assume that stack 6 is the longest one.

Within a loop that is involved in pseudo-knot formation, we assume that each of the stacks formed by the pseudo-knotted base pairs is a stiff helix. This reasoning leads to an ansatz based upon the following quantities: u = number of unpaired bases in the loop. L max = number of base pairs in the longest pseudo-knot stack.

A plot of log f versus the logarithm of the rank reveals a generalized Zipf's law (Zipf, 1949) , Fig. 8 . While the inclusion of pseudo-knots somewhat increases the fraction and the diversity of rare structures (large ranks) it does not change the general shape of the distribution. As for 'pure' secondary structures there is only a small number of common structures into which almost all sequences fold. Naturally, we ask how sequences folding into the same (common) secondary structure are distributed in sequence space. We call the set S(\u03c8) of all sequences (genotypes) folding into phenotype (contact structure) \u03c8 the neutral set of \u03c8. More precisely, S(\u03c8) is the pre-image of \u03c8 w.r.t. the folding map algorithm.

Surprisingly, this value is almost independent of the potential function: even a potential leading to a large fraction of pseudo-knotted structures decreases \u03bb only by a few percent.

Then we construct a series of subsequent mutants such that each sequence along the path folds into the same structure as the initial sequence, and such that each step increases the Hamming distance from the starting point. The strict logic on base pairing in RNA makes it necessary to consider two types of mutations: (i) point mutations in the unpaired regions of the molecules, and (ii) the substitution of one possible base pair (GC, CG, GU, UG, AU, UA). All other mutations in paired regions necessarily change the structure, for instance by changing a GU pair into a GG mismatch. If there are neutral networks in sequence space the neutral path will reach a length L close to n before there is no neutral mutant further away from the starting point (n is the maximal Hamming distance between sequences of length n). On the other hand, if the neutral sets S(\u03c8) form isolated clusters we will find L n.

While the number of possible contact structures grows faster than exponentially with the length of the molecules we find exponential upper bounds when the structural complexity is limited. In particular, there are not more than some 4.7 n possible bi-secondary structures.

This sets the stage for the evolutionary transitions between different structures described in detail in Weber (1997) and Fontana and Schuster (1998) .",
