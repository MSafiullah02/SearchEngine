The annual incidence of encephalitis is up to 12.6 per 100,000 individuals [1, 6, 7] , 20-30% of whom have an underlying autoimmune etiology [6, 7] . One recent population-based study found the prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis as 13.7 per 1000,000 individuals, comparable to all infectious encephalitides [2] . These observations may still be underestimates if we consider that as many as 50% of encephalitis patients have an unknown etiology [6, 7] and that the paraclinical findings associated with various autoimmune encephalitides included in recent consensus clinical criteria may be transient or of varied sensitivity [5] . Interestingly, new immune activating therapies introduced for oncological purposes are influencing the incidence of autoimmune encephalitis [8] . Although the clinical profile of encephalitic syndromes may suggest autoimmune causes, some clinical presentations may not immediately raise concerns for autoimmune encephalitis. For instance, new onset refractory status epilepticus (which may occur without cognitive or behavioral changes) may appear to be solely epileptic; however, over one third of these cases are found to be due to autoimmune encephalitis [9] . With improved identification of autoantibodies through refined testing practices and assay advances, the development and application of consensus clinical criteria, and the description of novel autoantibody-associated autoimmune encephalitis syndromes over the past decade, the incidence of autoimmune encephalitis is anticipated to continue to rise [1, 2] .",

This is likely the product of the recent detailed descriptions of these respective syndromes as well as the specificity of the respective antibodies to each syndrome. The clinical presentation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis is characterized by a viral illness-like prodrome of fever and/or headache followed over the course of days to weeks by personality changes (e.g., agitation, paranoia), short-term memory loss, and abnormal movements (e.g., ballismus, catatonia, choreoathetosis, dyskinesias, and/or dystonia) [21] . Patients can subsequently progress to develop generalized or partial-onset seizures and status epilepticus, depressed levels of consciousness, central hypoventilation, and dysautonomia. The majority of patients are female and in the second to third decades of life. With that said, the age range of cases extends from early childhood through the late elderly years, with anti-NMDAR encephalitis manifesting among males more commonly in the first through second decades [20] . Across all age groups, behavioral change is the most common first symptom, while seizures are prevalent [20] . This may be why anti-NMDAR encephalitis is frequently initially misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder [22, 23] . Movement disorders are common among patients less than 12 years in age, less so among those who are older [20] . Only 38% of patients are found to have an underlying malignancy at the time of initial presentation, most often an ovarian teratoma (94%) although a variety of other malignancies have been reported such as extraovarian teratomas and cancers of the lung and breast [20] .",

Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is characterized by shortterm memory loss, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms, with evidence of a combination of medial temporal lobe inflammation, temporal lobe epilepsy or dysfunction, or intrathecal inflammation. A large subset of patients (13%) present without evidence of brain inflammation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis [25] . Faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) have been described preceding the development of short-term memory loss and encephalopathy suggestive of limbic encephalitis by weeks to months in anti-LGI1 encephalitis. These immunotherapy (rather than antiepileptic) responsive seizures are very brief (on the order of seconds), frequent (median of 50 times per day in one series) unilateral or bilateral jerking movements of the arm and ipsilateral face more often than leg [18, 26] . High emotion or auditory or visual stimuli are triggers for FBDS in 28% of patients [26] . In those patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis presenting with FBDS, earlier treatment with immunotherapy predicted improved outcomes in terms of cognition, disability, and seizure control [18, 19] . As has been observed in patients with antibody responses directed at cell surface proteins, anti-LGI1 is not strongly associated with a particular cancer, with only 7% of patients found to have a malignancy [26] . The subsequent diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected autoimmune encephalitis is directed not only at supporting a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis and its sequelae to permit rapid treatment but also at assuring the absence of other etiologies of a subacute and progressive encephalopathy, particularly infectious encephalitides. When evaluating a patient with suspected autoimmune encephalitis, it is crucial to be mindful that the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis is clinical, incorporating clinical presentation with paraclinical findings, and is not solely dependent on the detection of an autoantibody.

This advisement is made since in some, but not all, autoimmune encephalitis syndromes (e.g., anti-NMDAR encephalitis), CSF antibody assays are more sensitive than those in the serum [5, 20, 25] . CSF antibody testing allows for greater specificity as it is not uncommon for multiple antibodies to be detected in the serum, with only one antibody detected in paired CSF that more likely reflects the underlying immune response [5] .

Elevated CSF to serum immunoglobulin G index and intrathecal oligoclonal bands are also supportive, though not diagnostic, of an intrathecal autoimmune response.

Case series reporting a gradient of occipital hypometabolism to frontotemporal hypermetabolism in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, hypermetabolism of the basal ganglia and medial temporal lobes in anti-LGI1 encephalitis, and normalization of these abnormalities with improvement in functional status suggest an expanded utility of FDG-PET in the evaluation and clinical monitoring of patients with autoimmune encephalitis [26, 35] . As the clinical value of brain FDG-PET is evaluated in the future, it will be important for researchers and clinicians to be mindful that abnormal patterns of cerebral metabolism on FDG-PET also have been well-described in neurodegenerative syndromes that can present with subacute cognitive decline, such as posterior cerebral atrophy and Lewy body dementia, which are both associated with occipital hypometabolism [36] . In addition, treatments commonly prescribed to patients in the acute phase of autoimmune encephalitis, such as corticosteroids and antiepileptic medications, have been observed to alter cortical metabolism [37, 38] .",

Some tumors produce peptides that are similar to those found in the nervous system, leading to immune cross-reactivity and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. In particular, the immune system reacts against tumors leading to the development of cytotoxic and antibody-mediated responses directed not only at the tumor but also against the nervous system. In 80% of cases, neurological manifestations develop before the cancer diagnosis [41] . Paraneoplastic disorders usually develop during the early stages of cancer, so the tumor may be difficult to find. If detected, an antibody can guide monitoring for strongly associated tumors. A patient should be followed with regular diagnostic imaging to screen for an occult malignancy at regular intervals for 4 years. Studies have shown that after this time, the likelihood of detecting cancer is low [42] .",

            "text": "The preceding discussion focused on the diagnostic value of each respective study for autoimmune encephalitis. In parallel, other diagnostic possibilities should be simultaneously evaluated for and eliminated as potential diagnoses. Differential considerations for a subacute, rapidly progressive encephalopathy include infection (e.g., encephalitis or meningoencephalitis due to herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enterovirus, Cryptococcus, syphilis, and prion disease), encephalopathy due to systemic disease (e.g., sepsis, organ failure, vitamin deficiency, electrolyte abnormalities), rheumatologic and systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), illicit (e.g., ketamine) or prescribed (e.g., anticholinergic, neuroleptic, serotonergic) drug toxicity or withdrawal, metabolic disorder (e.g., mitochondrial and urea cycle disorders), cerebrovascular disease (e.g., recurrent ischemic stroke), cancer (e.g., primary and secondary brain cancers), and seizure (e.g., nonconvulsive status epilepticus) [5, 43, 44] . A detailed clinical history with brain imaging by MRI, CSF analysis, and EEG can be invaluable in the early period of hospitalization to rapidly sift through this broad differential as well as gather information to support the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. This diagnosis should be made based on the clinical presentation, and diagnostic evaluation should not be reserved for those with a detected commercially testable antibody nor applied to those who respond to systemic immunotherapy. From a practical perspective, antibody testing may not always be readily accessible and, if performed, the results may take weeks to return. In addition, there is a growing catalog of described antibody-associated autoimmune encephalitis syndromes, some of which are not testable at the commercial laboratory level. Thus, failure to detect an antibody in the serum or CSF does not exclude the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis in the appropriate clinical scenario but rather argues for the testing of serum and CSF in a neuroimmunological referral center. With that said, falsepositive antibody results can occur. Finally, a variety of conditions respond by varying degrees to systemic immunosuppression, such as corticosteroids in the treatment of primary and secondary cancers of the brain as well as neurosarcoidosis. Together, these points emphasize the importance of the clinical presentation and a careful evaluation to identify those with autoimmune encephalitis.",

IA produces an immediate intravascular reduction of antibody and immune complex concentration as well as antibody redistribution that causes subsequent immunomodulatory changes. While PLEX is a nonselective medication and associated with a reduction in coagulation factors, IA is selective and has fewer adverse effects. In a retrospective analysis of 30 patients with autoimmune encephalitis treated with PLEX or IA, 65% improved after PLEX and 100% after IA [51] . Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of 13 patients with autoimmune encephalitis treated with IA showed that 85% had improvement of their symptoms; however, this efficacy could not be completely attributed to IA because most patients were treated with concomitant corticosteroids [53] .",

In a cohort of patients with autoimmune encephalitis, 28% of patients suffered from SE for 7 or more days and required on average 5 antiepileptic medications [15] . SE treatment in autoimmune encephalitis centers on the use of antiepileptic medications for seizure control as well as immunosuppression [60] . There are validated protocols for seizure control in SE that include IV lorazepam, diazepam, and phenytoin or intramuscular midazolam or rectal diazepam as first-line therapy (Class I). Valproate and levetiracetam are second-line options (Class I-III), and IV sedative medications such as pentobarbital, propofol, or midazolam are used in case of failure of first-and second-line therapies. If seizures are uncontrolled, topiramate and phenobarbital can also be considered. Of note, phenobarbital is associated with more adverse effects such as hypotension and a high mortality rate. In addition, once infectious etiologies have been eliminated, first-line immunotherapy as per the discussion above should be rapidly initiated. In case of severe seizures, a vagus nerve stimulator or surgical resection of the seizure focus may be necessary [61] . Early diagnosis and treatment of SE/RSE are associated with better neurological outcomes and fewer relapses [62] .",

In the emergency department setting, management begins with the clinical survey of airway, breathing, circulation, and glucose status. With the identification and treatment of potential vital sign-related issues, management progresses to the initial diagnostic evaluation including diagnosing autoimmune encephalitis and considering alternative diagnoses discussed earlier in this chapter. Patients may be treated empirically for some of these etiologies while awaiting diagnostic results (e.g. IV acyclovir for herpes simplex encephalitis while awaiting CSF test results). In addition, emergency room providers must assess for decreased or altered level of consciousness as well as their potential etiologies (e.g., seizure, elevated intracranial pressure due to cerebral edema). The management of each of these will likely continue through to triage to the ICU [67] .",

One should be mindful that the period of recovery following an episode of autoimmune encephalitis is on the order of weeks to months and is facilitated by directed physical, occupational, speech and language, and cognitive therapy. Psychiatric comanagement may also be required for those patients with psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis), which will require longitudinal care.

In addition to these functional and practical aspects of recovery, patients commonly reported symptoms of fatigue, emotional lability, short-term memory loss, and difficulty with concentration years after the initial episode of autoimmune encephalitis [10] .

Further studies are needed to determine a correlation between antibody titers and outcomes as well as the role of autonomic dysfunction and underlying malignancy in specific antibody subtypes.
