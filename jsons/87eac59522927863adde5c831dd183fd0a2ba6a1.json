It introduces and discusses the relevant actors and agents responsible for identifying health risks, and developing and ordering responses at the local, national, and international levels. Then it delves into the functions of trust and history in disordering (and potentially re-ordering) health: such as the role of reactance and the ostensible reclaiming of rights by refusing vaccination(s). The latter has been the case in the former East Germany for example, which experienced a large measles outbreak in 2015, as well as in California. The chapter explores ways and means for overcoming such political and policy gaps to promote health rights and responsibilities. Finally, the chapter explores ways in which decision-makers and decision-making respond to health threats that can(not) be contained.",

Nonetheless, containment of risks and threats, and mitigation of acute risks and threats, should and must be possible. First, it is necessary to identify health risks and threats; second, it should be feasible to respond, and to do so in a way that respects of rights of the infected and affected individuals and communities, a key lesson of the responses to HIV and AIDS and Ebola; third, policy plans, tools and mechanisms, should be in place to limit the scope of any outbreak; fourth, it is in the interest of all responders, and it is possible, to coordinate a standby response to identify and address the implications, both immediate and medium-and long-term, of an outbreak's occurrence. Finally, the world should expect both post-outbreak health problems and problems associated with social, economic and political fragility, and be at the ready to react again and again.",

Second, global health rights likewise elevated the notion of universal human rights and rendered them tangible in terms of health and, especially, access to health care.

The line between the two can be blurred by global travel. Nonetheless, varying degrees of preparedness, of preventive treatment and palliative health infrastructure reinforce these lines.

International organizations also can use media both to communicate their message(s) on health risk or threat response, and to gauge the receptivity of a population to proposed and later implemented interventionist or supportive measures.

By July 2014, Dr. Atai-Omoruto of Uganda had arrived in Liberia at the request of the WHO, along with 14 additional Ugandan health workers. Given that Uganda is not known for a surplus of health workers itself, this generosity to Liberia came at a cost to the Ugandan health system even as it represented positive regional support and international media coverage. At the same time, however, \"nongovernmental organizations were pulling their workers out of the country; and many governments were unwilling to send medics.\" 16 Thus both affected and (potentially) responding unaffected states decisions can be aided and abetted, both positively in facilitating health rights, and negatively in undermining these, by the actions of IOs and other states themselves.

For instance, during its G7 presidency, Germany hosted the replenishment conference for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance initiative. Pledges-not disbursements-even exceeded the initial target of US$7.5 billion.

The latter aims to develop common understanding of health system strengthening and to support actionable commitments at the country level. 20 This does not mean, however, that it is shifting its decision-making processes or power away from the sovereign state.

Dr. Krech, 24 compares the WHO response and the necessary WHO response to an outbreak to a fire brigade responding to a fire. As he sketches it, a fire brigade boasts numerous operationally coordinated elements. These are organized vertically and include: one-pre-determined, published-telephone number to be called for immediate help; a recognized leader, in the person of a chief fire officer giving orders that are followed; a working fire engine with hoses; adaptability to prevalent fire hydrants with adequate water flow.

This is the equivalent instead of the chief fire officer coming to discuss how the member state could response to the disease outbreak itself. \u2022 Assuming the member state is capable, it will likely respond to the outbreak with its own resources.
