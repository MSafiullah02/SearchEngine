The Death or 'D' model is a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, which assumes no recovery over time, and allows for the transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically. The D-model can be extended to describe various focuses of infection, which may account for the original pandemic (D1), the lockdown (D2) and other effects (Dn). The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries () shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown effect. These results are in agreement with more accurate calculations using the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more sophisticated Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a common evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.",

Its cornerstone is the so-called \"mass-action\" principle introduced by Hamer, which assumes that the course of an epidemic depends on the rate of contact between susceptible and infected individuals [5] . This idea was extended to a continuous time framework by Ross in his pioneering work on malaria transmission dynamics [6] [7] [8] , and finally put into its classic mathematical form by Kermack and McKendric [9] . The SIR model was further developed by Kendall, who provided a spatial generalization of the Kermack and McKendrick model in a closed population [10] (i.e. neglecting the effects of spatial migration), and Bartlett, who -after investigating the connection between the periodicity of measles epidemics and community size -predicted a traveling wave of infection moving out from the initial source of infection [11, 12] . More recent implementations have considered the typical incubation period of the disease and the spatial migration of the population.",

This is the final equation for the D-model, which presents a similar shape to the well-known Woods-Saxon potential for the nucleons inside the atomic nucleus or the bacterial growth curve. The rest of the parameters, \u00b5, \u03c4 , I 0 and N are embedded in the parameters a, b, c, which represent space-time averages and can be fitted to the timely available data. In Fig. 1 , we present the fit of the D-model to the COVID-19 death data for China, where its evolution has apparently been controlled and the D function has reached the plateau zone, with few increments over time, or fluctuations that are beyond the model assumptions. This plot shows the duration of the pandemic -about two months to reach the top end of the curve -and the agreement, despite the crude assumptions, between data and the evolution trend described by the D-model. This agreement encourages the application of the D model to other countries in order to investigate the different trends.",

The simple D model does not allow to do this explicitly, but changes in the spread can be taken into account by considering the total D or D n function as the sum of two or more independent D-functions with different parameters, which may reveal the existence of several independent sources, or virus channels. An example is shown in Fig. 5 , where the two-channel function has been fitted with six parameters to the Spanish data up to April 13. The fit reveals a second, smaller death peak, which substantially increase the number of deaths per day and the duration of the pandemic. This is equivalent to add a second, independent, source of infection several weeks after the initial pandemic. The second peak may as well represent a second pandemic phase driving the effects of quarantine during the descendant part of the curve.

This, together with the fact that c 2 can always be adjusted to 1, leaves the ESIR model with essentially 4 free parameters to fit to the daily death data; i.e. the same number of parameters than the original SIR model. As shown in Fig. 10 , ESIR fits reproduce well the long flattening behavior observed in UK, USA, Germany or Iran, whereas it fails to reproduce the more-pronounced double-peak structure typically observed in countries like France, Italy, Spain or Belgium.",

Although arising from different assumptions, both models provide similar data descriptions and predictions, with slightly better values of \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom for the ESIR2 model.

An infected cell can transmit the disease to any other susceptible cell within some random range R. The transmission mechanism follows principles of nuclear physics for the interaction of a particle with a target. Each infected particle interacts a number n of times over the interaction region, according to its energy. The number of interactions is proportional to the interaction cross section \u03c3 and to the target surface density \u03c1. The discrete energy follows a Planck distribution law depending on the 'temperature' of the system. For any interaction, an infection probability is applied. Finally, time-dependent recovery and death probabilities are also applied. The resulting virus spread for different sets of parameters can be adjusted from COVID-19 pandemic data. In addition, parameters can be made time dependent in order to investigate, for instance, the effect of an early lockdown or large mass gatherings at the rise of the pandemic.",

This is a very complex system, which involves many degrees of freedom and millions of people, and even assuming consistent disease reporting -which is rarely the case -there remains an important open question: Can any model predict the evolution of an epidemic from partial data? Or similarly, Is it possible, at any given time and data, to measure the validity of an epidemic growth curve?
