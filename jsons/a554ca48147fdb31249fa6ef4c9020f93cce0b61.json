Along with their resistant strains, new pathogenic viruses continue to be discovered so creating an ongoing need for new antiviral treatments. RNA interference is a cellular gene-silencing phenomenon in which sequence-specific degradation of target mRNA is achieved by means of complementary short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. Short interfering RNA technology affords a potential tractable strategy to combat viral pathogenesis because siRNAs are specific, easy to design, and can be directed against multiple strains of a virus by targeting their conserved gene regions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current status of siRNA therapy for representative examples from different virus families. In addition, other aspects like their design, delivery, medical significance, bioinformatics resources, and limitations are also discussed.",

            "text": "Because of their high mutation rates, viruses have the potential to elude host defense systems as well as antiviral drugs and vaccines. Thus, development of new and alternate antiviral therapies has become important. 1, 2 During the past decade, scientists have widely used the cellular RNA interference (RNAi) pathway approach to target a number of viral genes to restrain their expression. 3, 4 In this pathway, long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors are split into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) following which the RNA-induced silencing complex includes one of the siRNA strands and slices the complementary target mRNA using ATP. 5,6 Short interfering RNA technology has been exploited to target disease-causing genes as well as for functional studies. 7, 8 Also, this strategy can target diverse types of viruses as even a tiny viral genome can provide several targetable regions. For example, siRNAs directed against different genes of deadly viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 9, 10 influenza virus (INFV), 11, 12 hepatitis B virus (HBV), 13 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 14, 15 human papillomavirus (HPV), 16 and West Nile virus (WNV) 17 in infected cells displayed encouraging results in inhibiting viral replication. Researchers have also used multiple siRNAs simultaneously to augment viral inhibition in a coordinated approach. 18, 19 Short interfering RNAs for various human viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HBV, and HIV are also appearing in clinical trials, which further elucidate their importance in inhibiting viral infections. 20 Thus, siRNAs have emerged as practically modular and adaptable therapeutics for treating viral infections. In this review, we will discuss the use of siRNAs against different viral families, their therapeutic applications, and design and delivery considerations. Further limitations of siRNAs as antivirals and the remedial measures are also discussed.",

In particular, the silencing pathway involves chopping of dsRNA into siRNA that are typically 21 to 25 base pairs long dsRNA having dinucleotide overhangs on the 3\u2032 termini. One of the siRNA strands (guide strand) is then incorporated into an RNAinduced silencing complex that degrades the target mRNA. 5, 26 The siRNAs resulting from the original longer dsRNA are different from microRNAs as the latter in general have partial base pairing with a target mRNA and restrain the expression of several different genes having related sequences. Short interfering RNAs also differ from short hairpin RNAs as the latter have a hairpin turn and their expression in cells is usually achieved by means of bacterial/viral vectors. 27 Short interfering RNAs characteristically base-pair completely and cause mRNA cleavage in a precise target region. 28 MicroRNAs are generated from introns or their own genes. Gene silencing can take place through mRNA cleavage or thwarting mRNA translation. The role of microRNAs is to regulate gene expression. In the plant kingdom, RNAi is broadcasted by the transportation of siRNAs amid cells via plasmodesmata. 29 RNAi was described as the \"breakthrough of the year\" in 30 2002 . RNAi is also believed to be a component of a primitive immune system based on nucleic acid recognition. 31 show any harmful effect on control cells, which indicates meager off-target effects. 87 This illustrates that siRNA treatment has the potential to suppress the progression of cervical cancer.",

This method often involves cationic lipids to overcome the negative charge associated with siRNAs. 135 Lately, stable nucleic acid lipid particles have been used to efficiently stabilize and transport siRNAs. 136 Morrissey et al used stable nucleic acid lipid particles to deliver siRNAs against HBV, which efficiently inhibited the virus in mice. 137 Next, the polymer-based siRNA delivery vehicles (polyplexes) afford high structural and physicochemical flexibility while shielding the siRNAs against nucleases. 138 Likewise, inorganic nanoparticles generated from calcium phosphate, gold, carbon, and iron oxides are sometimes preferred to transport siRNAs due to their small size and increased permeability in comparison with liposomes and polyplexes. Occasionally, surface ligands are incorporated with the nanoparticles to enhance selective targeting of the diseased cells. 139 Plasmid and viral vectors are also used as expression cassettes for sustained silencing effect. However, use of plasmids limits the delivery efficiency as compared with the viral vectors. 140, 141 Alternatively, direct injection into the infected tissue may also help in targeting the specific cells. 134 ",

Plasmid-based vectors expressing siRNAs targeting the \u03bcNS, \u03bc2, and \u03c3NS genes of the T3D strain of reovirus considerably blocked multiple steps in the viral replication machinery in 293T cells. 48 These studies further illustrate the usefulness of siRNAs both as therapeutic agents and as important means for the investigation of relationship between structure and function of viral proteins. Arenaviruses contain a segmented RNA genome with 2 singlestranded ambisense RNAs. 95 Arenaviruses are often responsible for fatal hemorrhagic fever in people, and there is a lack of effective medications to tackle their infection. The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is a key model used in the investigation of arenavirus linked pathogenesis. Short interfering RNAs directed against L polymerase and Z viral mRNAs stall viral growth in HEK 293T host cells. 50 Paramyxoviridae are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. 96 The RSV is an important member of this group. It causes lung infection in young and the aged people worldwide. Short interfering RNAs targeting the RSV P gene in a BALB/c mice model showed less lung Rabies virus (RV) is a member of family Rhabdoviridae and causes fatal zoonotic disease in both humans and animals. It is responsible for 50 000 to 55 000 human deaths annually in Asia and Africa. 56 Brandao et al used siRNAs against rabies virus nucleoprotein mRNA, which decreased virus titers in BHK-21 cells. 57 Other workers developed siRNAs targeting rabies virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein showing remarkable knockdown effects and significant inhibition of This order of viruses, previously known as the Bunyaviridae family, includes enveloped, segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses. 98 Because of lack of effective vaccines and therapies for bunyaviruses in humans, siRNAs afford an attractive alternative. For example, the model Hazara virus of genus Nairovirus was inhibited by siRNAs targeting the NP gene in A549 cells. 59 Similarly, siRNAs developed against the agnoprotein of John Cunningham virus, the etiological agent of the demyelinating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy disease, proved to be an effective inhibitor of John Cunningham virus infection",
