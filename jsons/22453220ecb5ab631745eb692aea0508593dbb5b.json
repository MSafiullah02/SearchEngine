For every patient suspected of infection, chest radiograph should be performed. In order to further understand the condition of the chest, computed tomography (CT) scan (especially high-resolution CT scan) can provide doctors with more information. Except for contrast-enhanced CT, imaging examination is included in the morphological category, and different pathogens with semblable pathological and immune processes might give similar results [13]; yet, rapid and simple imaging tests are indispensable for concentrated outbreaks of infectious SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The principal techniques comprise chest radiography and thoracic CT scan. The former possesses density specificity, which could roughly determine lung lesions through the transparency in quick, and the latter has spatial specificity and could accurately parse the transverse section, including surrounding tissues, blood vessels, and lesions, of lungs[18]\u3002 (Table 1) For patients suspected to have SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 infection, the first test to be performed is a chest radiograph. The average abnormality rate of chest radiography in patients with SARS was 72%, 33% of which were GGO and 78% were consolidation [16, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . For MERS, an average of 86% of patients exhibited abnormalities in chest radiography, with 65% GGO, 18% consolidation, 17% bronchovascular markings, 11% air bronchogram, and 4% diffuse reticulonodular pattern [25-33]. COVID-19 showed an average chest radiographic abnormality rate of 56%, GGO in 24%, and pneumothorax in 1% of patients [10, 34-37]. Analysis of the abnormality rates of the three groups revealed no significant difference among them (P = 0.1734).",

Partly because of the lack of literature on MERS, no significant difference was found (P = 0.3516). However, in SARS and COVID-19, there was a significant difference between CT scan and qPCR findings (P = 0.0302, P = 0.00697) (Table.4 ). Although the specificity of qPCR could reach 100% [65, 76, 77] , a sufficient virus titer of the specimen was required. Notably, except for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (100%), the sputum showed the highest positive rate (74.4% ~ 88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6% ~ 73.3 %) [76] . The reasons could be the timing of specimen collection, specimen transport, testing, etc. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be considered to improve the sensitivity of qPCR, particularly if results of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tests were negative; however, with high clinical suspicion, follow-up serological testing should also be applied [15] . Most importantly, clinicians should implement appropriate infection control practices for patients with clinically suspected infection [15] , specifically with negative initial qPCR results, notably who possessed typical abnormality in CT scan or chest radiography. Additionally, a single swab was relatively insufficient. In a previous study on MERS infection, 89%of patients had a positive result after one swab, 96.5% had a positive result after two consecutive swabs, and the positive result reached 97.6% after three consecutive swabs [73] . Thus, the initial negative result could be unpersuasive unless repeated tests were performed.",
