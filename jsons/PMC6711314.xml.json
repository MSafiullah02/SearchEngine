Most animal viruses appear to have defined host ranges, circulating and maintaining themselves among a specific group of animal hosts in established relationships. Spillovers occur when viruses infect hosts in which they are not commonly found, and most often involve the infection of single animal species with limited (or no) transmission to additional animals of the same species [5]. However, the true host ranges (i.e. the animal species that are naturally infected and which can sustain transmission) and onward transmission potentials of many viruses are still poorly defined, because in the past, we did not sample to detect mild or subclinical infections, which appear to be quite common. In addition, our current understanding of the true natural host ranges of most viruses is likely incomplete due to the limited exposure of many animals which are geographically or ecologically isolated from the reservoir species in which the virus naturally circulates.",

            "text": "While disease ecologists have debated the best definition of a reservoir, one useful definition is an animal population that can maintain a virus in circulation and which may transmit to a target species such as humans [6,7]. However, it is still notoriously difficult to identify true reservoirs in natural systems, and furthermore, our knowledge of the viruses infecting different animal species and populations has been changing rapidly in recent years, but we have little information about the likelihood of human infection for most viruses of animals. Before the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, most viruses were known due to their associations with disease or as a result of isolations in laboratory culture. More recently, unbiased metagenomic analysis of animal-associated samples, including tissues and faeces, has resulted in the discovery of many more viruses based on finding their nucleic acid sequences [1\u20133]. Most of the viruses now being identified likely have low or no pathogenicity in their natural hosts and are of unknown risk to humans. However, we have clear examples from a number of examples of viruses that cause little disease in their reservoirs but which are highly pathogenic when transferred to new hosts, causing serious disease outbreaks. Among the known emerged viruses in humans, this appears to be true for Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and avian influenza A viruses (IAV). In addition to emergence in humans, there are many cases of viruses transferring between animals to cause outbreaks or epidemics in new hosts. Some human viruses can also be transferred to animals (as reverse zoonoses) to cause outbreaks directly, or to recombine or re-assort with sequences from other viruses of those animals to introduce altered host range properties\u2014this has been commonly observed for IAVs [8], as well as for metapneumovirus [9]. Some animals can be infected simultaneously by different viruses from humans and other animals, allowing recombination or reassortment, and those animals may therefore sometimes be referred to as \u2018mixing vessels\u2019 [10]. Those resulting viruses may have new host range, antigenic or transmission properties compared to either of their parental strains.",

For example, humans are frequently exposed to viruses of domesticated animals and to those of animals that live in our environment\u2014but most never cause infections. Those exposures may be increasing due to anthopogenic effects (including but not limited to habitat destruction or climate change). Even for many known zoonotic viruses, it is likely that hundreds or even thousands of people are exposed for every person who is infected and who develops detectable disease. It is not always clear where the block to infection occurs, but some of the different possible barriers that viruses may encounter and overcome have been reviewed in [5]. However, it is clear that infection may be blocked at one or more steps in the infection process, including physical barriers, mucus of several types, ciliary and other clearance processes, natural antibodies to some viral glycoproteins or other viral components, innate immune responses that block virus establishment and infection, replication or shedding.",

This review addresses both steps leading to successful emergence by outlining the host and viral factors that were associated with the emergence of three different viruses which have given rise to pandemics in new hosts. Those include an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus (IAV), an enveloped RNA-genome retrovirus that replicates through a DNA intermediate (HIV) and a non-enveloped small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus that replicates using host DNA polymerases (canine parvovirus (CPV)). Despite their different structures and replication strategies, each of those emerging viruses had to overcome common barriers to efficiently replicate and transmit in their new hosts, so that they illuminate the common, as well as the virus-unique, processes involved. Because of the limited space and the vast literatures that describe many of these viruses and their properties, we largely reference selected recent reviews; many specific references are contained within those reviews.",

Several different host barriers have been identified that were overcome by one or more emerging IAVs, and those have been recently comprehensively reviewed [11], and also an assessment of pandemic risk has been developed [29]. The main pathways to human emergence are outlined in figure 1. Each epidemic in humans and most other mammals has initiated with a single virus genotype, and that virus is assumed to have overcome a number of barriers to become a well-adapted and transmissible virus of mammals. Across these known examples of animal influenza viruses overcoming host-specific differences to cause epidemics in humans, genetic changes have been identified in almost every step of the IAV replication cycle. Those include the animal environments that differ between the avian gastrointestinal tract which is around 41\u00b0C, and the upper or lower respiratory tracts of mammals, which are approximately 34 or approximately 37\u00b0C. Other differences include the display and binding of specific sialic acid receptors and linkage forms which influence haemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage, release of the viral ribonucleoproteins from the endosome and transport to the nucleus, RNA replication and/or transcription, antagonizing various interferon-associated innate immune responses, viral budding from the cell and release from the cell surface, shedding and transmission among individuals of that host [11].\n",

            "text": "The receptor for IAV is described as sialic acid (Sia), but on more detailed analysis, it is clear that the IAV receptor is complex and may vary in form between hosts [11,30,31]. The Sia found on human cells is the N-acetyl neuraminic acid, but in other hosts modified forms such as N-glycolyl neuraminic acid are also commonly found, while in some (horses and guinea pigs), there are high levels of an inhibitory Sia, Neu4,5Ac. Those structural differences may influence the binding of HA, and also inhibit the sialidase activity of the viral NA. A second level of receptor specificity comes from the linkage of the Sia to the glycan, which is commonly \u03b12,6 in the upper respiratory tract (and a combination of \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 in the lower respiratory tract) in humans, but is most often \u03b12,3 in the intestinal tract of birds and some other hosts. The switch in specificity from the \u03b12,3 to the \u03b12,6 Sia linkage seems to be a requirement for efficient human-to-human transmission [30]. A third receptor-associated inter-host difference is the length and branching of the glycan, and the number of Sia that are displayed [32,33]. This may affect the binding of HA to the receptor as more branched and multi-Sia glycans can bind virus with higher affinity. The length of the glycan may also require a change in the structure of the NA tetramer, which tends to have shorter sequences in the stalk structure in viruses growing in avian tissues, and longer when the longer glycans in the human respiratory tract are encountered [11].",

            "text": "Once taken into the cell, there are additional host factors that interact with the IAV components in a host-specific manner [11,37]. While several important host factors have been identified, three that are well characterized are the tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which can bind the incoming viral ribonuleoproteins and reduce infection, and the MxA protein (in humans) which is a nuclear interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that binds to the viral ribonuleoproteins to block infection. Viruses from birds or other hosts may be able to evade those factors through the acquisition of specific mutations in PB2 or nucleoprotein. During replication, IAVs induce additional host immune responses, in particular the interferon response, which triggers the expression of many different interferon-stimulated genes that can block many steps of the viral replication cycle. The IAV non-structural 1 protein is a multipurpose protein that can block or downregulate many of those responses, and evolution of NS1 occurs after transfer into new hosts to optimize the antagonism of the host innate immune response [11,37,38]. Some of these changes are likely to be involved in fine tuning the virus:host interaction after pandemic spread has already been accomplished [39]. For example, the ability of IAV NS1 to interact with the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 30 and inhibit host gene expression and interfering with the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway have been shown to be an important mechanism of IAV host adaptation [40].",

The processes underlying the transmission of influenza viruses are still not well understood, but likely require optimal receptor interactions and replication, along with the ability to survive in the respiratory secretions of the new host. In humans, the respiratory secretions that the virus is shed in have a relatively low pH (around 5.5), and a number of mutations in the interior of the HA trimer have been found that stabilize the HA at lower pHs and have been associated with the ability to transmit efficiently [41,42].",

There have been at least four strains of HIV-1 identified, that each represents a single transfer from either chimpanzees (M and N strains from the SIVcpz) or from gorillas (O and P strains from SIVgor [48]); the M (major) strain is the pandemic strain and responsible for greater than 98% of human infections [12]. There appear to be many strains of SIV in old world monkeys and the SIVcpz viruses in chimpanzees arose from an ancestral virus that included portions of three different SIVs\u2014from an SIV of an unknown host, an SIV of greater spot-nosed, Mona and mustached monkeys and an SIV from sooty mangabey [12]. Although it is clear that all SIVcpz strains were derived from one common ancestor that contained sequences derived from SIVs from several other species, it is not clear whether that ancestor emerged in chimpanzees, in a previous simian host, or through some combination of co-infections. This virus eventually gave rise to the M and N strains that infected humans, and it also infected gorillas and, in gorillas gave rise to the HIV-1 O and P strains, that were then transmitted to humans. The HIV-1 M strain has caused the global pandemic, while the O strain has caused infection in hundreds of thousands of humans in Central Africa. Other spillovers of lentiviruses from other primates are named HIV-2, and those infect fewer individuals in limited outbreaks. This complex genetic background of HIV shows that the emergence of broadly sustained epidemic or pandemic primate lentiviruses in humans is a difficult process, that only the M and O strains have accomplished.",

Each strain exemplifies the model where virus spillover from original reservoirs (multiple monkey species) into an intermediate host (chimpanzee for the M strain, in addition to gorilla for the O strain) allowed the virus to gain several changes that allowed it to counteract or become better adapted to several host factors that would otherwise interfere with the virus infection, replication and/or release. The transfer to humans of the M strain was also associated with efficient cell infection, replication and transmission. Similarly, the transfer of the ancestor of the O strain from chimpanzees into gorillas appears to have allowed some additional adaptation, after which the virus transferred to humans. The genetic changes and sequence combinations that allowed successful replication and spread in humans were acquired by complex combinations of recombination, gene rearrangement and acquisition, and point mutations as outlined below. It is assumed that the genetic variation derives from the error- and recombination-prone natures of the viral reverse transcriptase and of the RNA polymerase that produces the viral RNA from the integrated cDNA.\n",

Known host factors that are involved in cell infection and viral adaptation are the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) receptor, C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receptor, Tripartite motif-containing protein 5 \u03b1 form (TRIM5\u03b1), apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) 3D, APOBEC F, APOBEC G, APOBEC 3H, SAM and HD Domain Containing Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate Triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1), Tetherin, human silencing hub (HUSH) RanBP2 [45]. Each has a degree of host specificity that required one or more modifications or countermeasures from the virus for successful emergence in one or more of the new hosts. The necessary adaptations were achieved through amino acid changes or by the acquisition or modification of viral accessory protein genes: for TRIM5\u03b1, this involved mutations in the capsid protein; for APOBECs, it required the presence of the Vif gene; SAMHD1 was countered by the viral Vpr; Tetherin by Nef and/or Vpu; human silencing hub (HUSH) complex by Vpr; RanBP2 interacted with the capsid protein and was countered by capsid mutations. There was also some specificity of attachment or use of the CCR5 protein co-receptor in different hosts [49]. The number of factors viruses had to overcome or become adapted to indicates the complexity of the host-switching process, particularly for the M and O strains. Analysis of the complete SIV and HIV sequences searching for human-specific mutations has shown very few point mutations\u2014indeed, it appears that there is only a single mutation in the gag protein (matrix\u2014MA) associated specifically with adaptation to the human host [50,51].",

All of these viruses cause a systemic infection in animals, infecting through the oro-nasal route, replicating in and spreading between tissues that contain dividing cells, including the lymphoid tissues and the rapidly dividing cells in the crypts of the small intestinal villae [54]. The virus is shed in the faeces of the infected animal, where it is able to survive for long periods allowing efficient transport on fomites. While FPV-like viruses do not bind and infect canine cells in tissue culture, they may replicate in dogs in some tissues after natural exposure, primarily in the thymus [62]. Replication in those internal tissues did not result in efficient shedding of the virus, so those infections are dead-end spillovers.

Persistent infection and shedding provides prolonged opportunities for transmission (e.g. by HIV), while acutely infecting viruses (such as IAV and CPV) are only shed for a few days, so that contact is required (IAV) or survival in faecal matter (CPV). There are many details of transmission that need to be determined, including the physical nature of the shed virus and host components, and the roles of different regions of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract (or other sites) in facilitating transmission. Invertebrate vectors may impose an addition level of host adaptation, but they may facilitate the spread of a virus in a new host population.

Changes in hosts and host populations that alter the likelihood of emergence include population size, density, mobility, behaviour such as sexual practices, and connectedness. Transmission heterogeneity is likely important early in outbreaks of new viruses, when stochastic events will often determine the outcome, and in particular, \u2018superspreaders\u2019 may create a large number of secondary infections that allow viruses to overcome demographic barriers [66,67].

Those confirm that the replication of many viruses is relatively low fidelity and creates many mutations, providing significant amounts of genetic variation in most viral populations. While RNA viruses and retroviruses show frequent mutations and recombination or reassortment, it is now clear that sequence variation is also common in both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA viruses [68]. We are rapidly gaining new insights into the complexities of viral sequences and their structures, as well as the roles of low-level polymorphisms as substrates for rapid evolution [69\u201371]. As described above, and reviewed elsewhere [72,73], the emergence of new epidemic viruses requires host adaptive mutations, recombination or reassortment, or the acquisition of modifications and accessory genes. Retrospective analysis indicates that those changes occur during the early stages of infection and spread in the new host or within an intermediate host, and that those are required to give increased replication and transmission. It is not generally possible to identify those key mutations before virus emergence, but we can now identify adaptive mutations required for initial epidemic spread, or for additional \u2018fine tuning\u2019 of the host range [39]. The functional expression of mutations may be dependent on the sequence context of the virus, creating a significant historical contingency, so that low-risk mutations in one strain may be high risk in even closely related strains.",

Studying known host range models clarifies the mechanisms that allow specific host entry, replication, transmission and shedding, and reveals the key evolutionary events that have occurred in previous outbreaks. Integrated models of spillover and early transmission can be paired with a knowledge of animal and human viruses. Key challenges include methods to distinguish cases infected directly from animal spillovers (primary cases) and secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission, and methods to estimate transmissibility, which are often difficult to obtain at the start of an epidemic. By clarifying the series of steps that are required to go from exposure to spillover to epidemic or pandemic, new models should identify multiple points where strategic interventions could allow us to forestall new viruses before they can emerge to create widespread epidemics.",
