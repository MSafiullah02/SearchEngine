Recently the World Health Organization has included the loss of smell or taste as a new symptom of COVID-19 infection as have many Health Authorities after a surge of publications and press releases that pointed to anosmia as a potential screening symptom that might contribute to the decision to test suspected cases or guide quarantine instructions. Subsequently, Otolaryngologic and Rhinologic Societies have worldwide also advised to consider patients with newly acquired sudden loss of smell as potentially positive for SARS-CoV-2. Given the increase of publications concerning anosmia, and the fact that most current research is under \u201ctime-pressure\u201d to provide insight to the pandemic, we undertook a review of the published relevant literature. The objective of this systematic review was to examine existing scientific evidence on the role of anosmia detection in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the areas of need for further research.",

The studies took place from mid-January to mid-April. There were great methodological differences among the studies. A large epidemiological study reported on 9199 persons who were recruited for targeted testing in Iceland [9]. Four large observational case series reported anosmia prevalence in COVID-19 cohorts from China [3], Belgium and other European countries [2], USA [8], Italy [11]. Five case\u2013controlled studies compared the smell/taste loss between SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants and patients PCR-positive for influenza [4], a panel of respiratory viruses [10], matched hospitalized controls [6, 20], and patients tested for influenza-like symptoms for COVID-19 [19]. Five cross-sectional studies of SARS-CoV-2 + patients report on smell/taste loss in patients with varying COVID-19 disease severity [1, 5, 7, 21, 22]. Four small case series and a case report of anosmic patients, most of whom had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 with various indications [14\u201318] and four electronic surveys about smell loss [12, 13, 23, 24] commented on the increase of the patients seeking treatment for smell loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. The electronic surveys included the AAOHNS COVID-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool (completed by healthcare providers) [12], The RADAR COVID-19, an online app for the UK general population [23] and two surveys prompted by patients\u2019 queries about smell loss (in UK [13] and Iran [24]), one reporting on a small percentage tested for SARS-CoV-2.",

The observed discrepancies most likely are related to varying research methods and possible patient selection biases. A significant proportion of the cohort in the studies reporting high anosmia prevalence was healthcare personnel [2, 11]. Cross-sectional studies found the prevalence of anosmia to be at 33.9% [1] and 35.7% [21] for hospitalized patients and 64.4% [5] and 68% [7] for out-patients. Smell loss prevalence was compared between COVID-19 patients and control groups in five case-controlled studies: 22.7% of COVID-19 patients compared to 2.8% of patients positive for a panel of respiratory viruses [10], 31.6% of COVID-19 compared to 12.5% of influenza [4], 29% of COVID-19 patients compared to 18% for controls [6], 49% compared to 0% for controls [20], and 64.7% of COVID-19 patients compared to 10.1% for respiratory viral illness [19].
