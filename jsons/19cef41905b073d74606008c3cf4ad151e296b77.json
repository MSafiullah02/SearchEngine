Much of the research has been focused on minimizing transmission in hospitals and in the general community. However, a particularly vulnerable community that has received relatively little attention is elders residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In this article we address this relative lack of attention, arguing that enhanced traffic control bundling (eTCB) can and should be adopted and implemented as a means of protecting LTCF residents and staff. Enhanced TCB has been widely applied in hospital settings and has proven effective at limiting droplet and fomite transmissions both within hospitals and between hospitals and the general community. By effectively adapting eTCB to LTCF conditions, particularly by incorporating compartmentalization within zones plus active surveillance, COVID-19 transmission into and throughout LTCFs can be minimized, thereby saving numerous lives among an especially vulnerable population.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) erupted in Wuhan China in late December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On March 11, 2020 , the WHO affirmed the rapid spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to a pandemic. 1 COVID-19 is highly transmissible and yet of lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV 2003. Based on current data, we estimate that over 80% of identified cases are self-limited mild illness. Severe cases occur largely among those aged over 60, while case-fatality rates are highest among elderly people suffering from co-morbidities. 2 In general, the elderly suffer from weakened immunity and underlying diseases. When the aged population living together in semi-confined spaces such as long term care facilities (LTCFs) they are among the populations most vulnerable to infection and rapid spread. 3, 4 As a result, there is at a high risk of widespread transmission within LTCFs with the potential for high case-fatality rates and then spread back into the community thereby contributing to overall disease spread. 5, 6 It is therefore essential that the health care community develop infection control guidelines on prevention measures to address pandemic preparedness and response in LTCFs. 7, 8 Here we offer recommendations based on what we consider the \"gold standard\" for pandemic preparedness and response in LTCFs. However, we recognize that the ideal response we describe is likely not an option for LTCFs in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we urge LTCF officials to view these recommendations as both guidance to address the current situation as well as long-term recommendations they should consider in preparation for future epidemics.",

And, due to high transmissibility rates via droplet and contact transmission, respiratory viral infections are among the infections most frequently plaguing LTCFs. 4,9e11 These infections arrive in LTCFs from hospitals and the general community. The infections are brought in by people entering the facilities, including employees, family members and other visitors, workers and new residents.

In addition, while many ill patients have either trivial symptoms or remain asymptomatic throughout their illness, are all capable of transmitting the virus to others. 12 These people are difficult to identify but they may unwittingly spread the infection through droplet and fomite transmission while in the LTCF. Invariably, these unwitting transmissions will result in infection clusters that may erupt in a surge affecting the entire institution. 6 Infection control guidelines for LTCFs Designate a chief officer responsible for epidemic preparedness and response LTCF leadership should designate a staff member to lead epidemic preparation and response in the LTCF. The designated person should be trained in the basics of infection control, including surveillance and reporting such as web-reporting through the syndromic surveillance system; hand hygiene, cleaning and environmental disinfection, and maintaining essential stockpiles. 7, 8 Maintaining surveillance and reporting for healthcare workers/caregivers and residents In addition to routine chest x-rays at regular interval, all people at the LTCF should be vaccinated against influenza and pneumonia. During an outbreak staff and residents should receive and know how to engage in timely reporting after the appearance of any COVID-19 related symptoms/ signs and /or discomfort. In addition, a regular health log should be maintained for both staff and residents noting in particular any potential exposure. Healthcare workers (HCWs) should be discouraged from engaging in work in more than one LTCF in order to avoid the possibility of inter-facility infection. 13 Ensuring education and training Staff and residents should be informed about COVID-19 and major infection control procedures including hand disinfection and fomite control. Special attention must be given to training part time workers or inadequately trained nurse assistants. 8, 14 Allocating epidemic/pandemic prevention equipment LTCFs must ensure that they are adequately supplied with personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks, gloves and alcohol-based disinfectant. Plans must be in place to ensure equipment is effectively utilized and replaced as needed during a pandemic. 15 Engage in environmental cleaning and disinfection As fomite transmission may play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, environmental disinfection must be highlighted as a routine daily practice according to general infection control guidelines. Disinfection is essential for all frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, bed rails, tables, light switches, bathrooms, etc.. In all locations, disinfection requires a two-step process including preliminary cleaning with a regular detergent followed by disinfection with hospital-grade disinfectant or a diluted concentration of bleach. 7",

These essential personnel include, HCWs, nurse assistants, new resident and support personnel responsible for laundry, kitchen and daily tasks such as cleaning and waste disposal. All entrants must be assessed based on history of TOCC (travel, occupation, contact, cluster-detailed below). TOCC is potentially the most valuable surveillance and risk assessment tool available at the initial stage and site in both the containment and mitigation phases of the COVID-19 response. 19 TOCC involves taking a travel history for each person entering the facility as well as assessing their occupational history regarding potential encounters with foreign travelers. Contact history must also be taken to identify those who may have visited a hospital or emergency room in the previous two weeks. Finally, in the phase of community circulation, a history of encounters with potential clusters should be identified. Importantly, symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, general malaise, influenza-like illness or diarrhea, loss of taste, and skin rashes are contraindicated and as such, people exhibiting such symptoms should be forbidden entry to the facility. . The goal of compartmentalization in LTCFs is to supplement enhanced traffic control bundling as a further means of limiting COVID-19 (or other infectious disease) transmission. According to this approach, LTCFs establish distinct compartments within clean zones. Each compartment is staffed by healthcare workers and support staff who are specifically designated to that compartment. Compartments are, ideally, in separate buildings. However, since this is rarely an option, separate floors in the same building or even clearly differentiated zones on the same floor are options. Movement among compartments should be minimized, but when necessary must involve proper hand hygiene at designated hand disinfection checkpoints established between each compartment.

            "text": "According to Six Sigma principles, the more you compartmentalize response planning into individual steps, the more likely you are to identify details that might otherwise be overlooked when developing infection control protocols. 15 Drawing on Six Sigma, we developed eTCB as a multi-layered system. For example, the clean zone itself is divided into distinct compartments to block the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the system (Fig. 1) . Compartmentalization can be adapted to specific conditions in each LTCF. For example, while ideally compartmentalization in the clean zone may involve separate buildings, compartmentalization can also occur using different floors within one building, or even distinct wards/ blocks on the same floor. Each distinct compartment is staffed by designated staff including a HCW and nurse attendant who do not rotate to other compartments. By remaining in only one compartment, the potential for transmission within the LTCF clean zone and beyond is minimized. Ideally, support staff (including part-time staff working in cleaning, laundry and catering) should also be assigned to only one compartment. However, if staffing is insufficient, support staff should be trained in hand disinfection (to block fomite transmission) in addition to daily environmental cleaning and disinfection to minimize the risk of cross-compartment spread. 16 During a pandemic, it is also important to limit to the extent possible regular group activities conducted in public spaces (including public dining). If a gathering is deemed necessary, the public space to be used must be disinfected both in advance of and following the gathering. In addition, participants should be required to wear masks, disinfect their hands (prior to and following any activity), and adhere to proper social distancing. If dining in a common area is necessary, residents should maintain 2 meters separation and refrain from sitting in groups, speaking loudly or laughing, in order to minimize droplet or contact/fomite transmission. 22 Checkpoint hand disinfection Hand disinfection should not be limited to the entrance of the LTCF. We recommend disbursing disinfection stations equipped with alcohol-based hand disinfectant throughout the LTCF between zones and compartments, including at the entrance, in quarantine rooms and throughout public spaces in clean zones. To ensure compliance with hand hygiene guidelines, appropriate signage should be placed as this will increase the likelyhood that everyone engages in hand disinfection appropriately and conveniently, particularly after contacting with fomites in the environment. 14, 17 In clean zones, alcohol-based sanitizer dispensers should be positioned at checkpoints along traffic routes connecting each compartment (Fig. 1 ). In compliance with eTCB, all personnel transitioning across compartments should follow strict checkpoint hand disinfection and decontamination to ensure hand hygiene and facilitates containment of contact/fomite transmission 14, 17 Specific consideration for medical care in LTCF LTCF residents tend to be older and suffer from various comorbidities. As a result, residents depend on receiving regular care from outside healthcare facilities. Once they leave the LTCF, residents are at heightened risk of exposure to infection.",
