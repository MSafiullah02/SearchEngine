            "text": "This paper is avowedly a report from the front line, rather than an abstract academic disquisition. It is, further, at best, a first draft of history. It reflects the experience of a practising barrister in England & Wales grappling with the impact of COVID-19 upon the Mental Capacity Act 2005 ('MCA 2005') across a range of fields in the weeks after the world appeared to change in mid-March 2020. 1 In the course of a few short weeks, many of the established legal frameworks relating to decision-making in England & Wales in respect of those with impaired decision-making capacity were ripped up, or apparently rendered all but unusable. Although the MCA 2005 itself was not amended, the impact of other legislation (especially the Coronavirus Act 2020) meant that duties towards those with impaired decision-making capacity were radically changed. Questions of isolation and social distancing raised stark questions about protectionand the ends of protectionwith particular difficulties in the context of those who could not understand what they were being asked or required to do. The intense pressure upon hospitals, and, in particular intensive care units, meant that best interests decisionmaking as the choice between available options suddenly took on a new and very stark character, and advance care planning startedin some casesto appear to be a threat rather than an opportunity. And the Court of Protection itself, the statutory court charged with oversight of the MCA 2005, had in a matter of weeks to transform itself into a virtual court, raising deep questions about the functions of justice and participation. This article discusses both England and Wales. Devolution means that there are similarities and differences between the two. 2 The MCA 2005 applies in England & Wales as the framework through which decisions are made (most often informally) about capacity and best interests, on the basis of a functional model of mental capacity. The MCA 2005 also provides an administrative route for deprivation of liberty for purposes of enabling care and treatment of adults in hospitals and care homes, the so-called Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards ('DoLS'). Outside hospitals/care homes, or in relation to those aged under 18, court authorisation will be required. Separately, and long-predating The MCA 2005 does not provide any mechanism to compel the delivery of health or social care to an individual. The Court of Protection has a duty to act in the best interests of the person before it, as do others (outside the court room arena) making best interests decision on their behalf. But the Court of Protection:",

Here, I focus on the position outside hospital where, as noted above, the NHS (throughin England -Clinical Commissioning Groups) has both powers and duties to meet continuing healthcare needs. 11 The CA 2020, with immediate effect, suspended 12 the duty on the NHS in England to carry out assessments of whether a person is in need of continuing healthcare. Crucially, such continuing healthcare needs are free to access, unlike social care provision for which charges can be made. The Explanatory Notes to the Act rather coyly suggested this section \"changes the procedure for discharge from an acute hospital setting for those with a social care need [\u2026] It allows NHS providers to delay undertaking the NHS Continuing Healthcare (NHS CHC) Assessment and pending that assessment, the patient will continue to receive NHS care.\" 13 The provisions of the CA 2020 in this respect were not, in fact, so limited. Although s.14 CA 2020 does not stop Clinical Commissioning Groups carrying out such assessments, the (temporary) repeal of the duty mean that, overnight, individuals with profound healthcare needs lose any entitlement to assessment of those needs as a precursor to the potential for those needs to be met, for free. Those of such individuals with impaired decision-making capacity therefore losein many casesthe potential for options to be made available for them in terms of their residence and care arrangements.",

In the context of immigration control, the fiction (and it is frequently a fiction) is that the individual concerned could always return to the country from where they came from, so it is not surprising that the courts have interpreted the ECHR as providing a minimalist safety net designed to ensure that the UK does not breach its obligations to those individuals under the Convention.

In a series of cases starting in 2013, 104 the Court of Protection had developed an increasingly sophisticated notion of best interests in this context in which even interventions with a very small chance of success could be said to be in the best interests of the patient if it was clear that this is what they wanted. 105 This did notquitecross the line into holding that approaching matters through the prism of best interests could require that clinicians provide treatment that they did not consider clinically appropriate, 106 but on occasion came very close. 107 The impact of COVID-19, however, means that it appears clear that decision-making in the case of those with impaired decision-making (and whether or not they have COVID-19) might have to be undertaken on the basis not of what was in their best interests, but on a utilitarian basis in order to save the maximum number of lives.

In other cases, it appeared that judgments were being made that (e.g) CPR should not be attempted because they had, for instance, a learning disability.

Any detention of mentally ill persons must have a therapeutic purpose, aimed specifically, and in so far as possible, at curing or alleviating their mental-health condition, including, where appropriate, bringing about a reduction in or control over their dangerousness. The Court has stressed that, irrespective of the facility in which those persons are placed, they are entitled to be provided with a suitable medical environment accompanied by real therapeutic measures, with a view to preparing them for their eventual release.44    and also the decision in Hiller v Austria 45 in which the court held that:today's paradigm in mental health care is to give persons with mental disabilities the greatest possible personal freedom in order to facilitate their re-integration into society.

It would, in other words, be an argument that the local authority was exercising its (revised) powers under s.18 Care Act 2014 incompatibly with the ECHR, and hence unlawfully for purposes of s.6 Human Rights Act 1998.Finally, and given what became rapidly and tragically clear was the very real risk to life posed by COVID-19 within care homes, 47 it could also be argued that, within the specific context of COVID-",

Remote access to the Court has become a necessity and it is the responsibility of all involved to ensure that such hearings continue to provide proper access to justice. These arrangements are driven by the inevitable restrictions on freedom of movement that have been put in place to protect public health. Remote hearings, i.e. by Skype or alternative versions of video link, will sometimes fall short of providing the opportunities that are available in a live hearing in a court room.

However, for completeness, and because of the overlap between individuals with impaired decision-making capacity and those falling within the scope of the MHA 1983, it is important to note that here, too, the landscape has been changed. This is not just because of the complexities of addressing public health concerns within psychiatric hospitals, which bring with them similar issues to those discussed above in relation to DoLS, but also because of changes to primary legislation.The CA 2020 includes (in s.10 and Schedule 8) the power to make temporary changes to mental health and mental capacity legislation across the United Kingdom. Those powers include the ability drastically to strip back the procedural safeguards around admission and treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983; 117 it is perhaps odd, given how much more relevant the MCA 2005 is to the response to the pandemic, that the CA 2020 only addressed the MHA 1983 in primary legislation. 118 At the time of time of writing, those powers have not been brought into force. However, the power under the Act 119 to enable changes to the composition of the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales was brought into force on enactment, mirrored by a Pilot Practice Direction 120 in England. At a stroke, tribunals were reduced to single judges (as opposed to a judge sitting with a medical member and a specialist lay member) sitting remotely, with hearings taking place largely by telephone. I do not dwell further upon these changes, except to say that the reader can easily imagine the practical impact upon all concerned, above all the patients. 121",

But there are glimmers of hopefor instance in the potential for the ECHR to be a very much more powerful tool than it has been to date in terms of securing service provision. 122 And in a world where nothing appears certain, and everyone, irrespective of disability, is seeking answers, it is arguably easier than it was ever before for supported decision-making to appear something of universal relevance.
