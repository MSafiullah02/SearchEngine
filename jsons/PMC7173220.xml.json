The changes appear to have resulted from high passage of the virus through cell cultures. Virulence of TGEV in piglets was reduced through serial passage in cell cultures [25]. And ORF 3 has been suggested as an important determinant for the virulence of the virus. PEDV consists of spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (sM), ORF 3, and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and all have been sequenced [2], [7]. The loss of ORF 3 product demonstrated an unexpected feature caused by the adaptation in cell culture [3], [21], which may explain why the adaptation of PEDV in cell culture may reduce the virulence of wild-type virus. Piglets inoculated with a PEDV serially passaged in Vero cells showed reduced disease and lesions [13]. Therefore, unexpected features observed through cell culture is of much interest.",

In previous reports, wild-type and cell culture-adapted PEDVs differed in their abilities to cause diarrhea in neonate piglets [1]. Piglets inoculated orally with CV777, a wild-type PEDV, became sick and developed severe diarrhea [5]. When compared with wild PEDVs, animals inoculated with a highly cell-passaged virus did not show any severe signs of diarrhea [13]. The KPEDV-9 strain was serially passaged in Vero cell cultures up to passage level 93 and became a candidate of live PEDV vaccine, so we continued to serial passage up to passage level 100.",

And also all the inoculated sows had no clinical signs like abortion, diarrhea, anorexia, and pyrexia. Antibody was detected through serum from piglets and colostrums from pregnant sows. Because the protection of the piglets against PEDV is based on the specific antibodies which have been demonstrated in the colostrums of the immune sows, we evaluated the antibody titer of colostrums from pregnant sows. However there would be variable in piglets\u2019 immunity according to the degree of colostrums uptake of a piglet, litter size, the concentration of antibodies and the quality of colostrums.",
