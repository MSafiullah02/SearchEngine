However, little has been done on how these children experience their situation and how they cope with dietary treatment. Two British studies ( I , 2) , an Italian study (3) and a Finish study (4) have dealt with these questions. In both British studies, dietary compliance was approximately 60%, in the Italian study it was 65% and in the Finish study it was 76%. Treatment of C D is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for life. This is based on the knowledge that when gluten is reintroduced, sooner or later small bowel mucosal pathology recurs, even though symptoms may be absent (5-7). Furthermore, Holmes et al. (8) have suggested that lifelong dietary treatment may have a protective role against development of malignancy.",

(1) we also found a correlation between knowledge and compliance. Older children were less strict in their diet. One explanation for this is that older teenagers more often eat snacks containing gluten while with friends and visiting restaurants. Another explanation could be that some doctors tend to accept some deviation from strict GFD after puberty when the most important period of growth and development has passed. Girls were adhering to the GFD better than boys. Part of this difference was due to the fact that there were relatively more girls in the younger group, where compliance was better.",

Education and discussion groups are methods used in diabetes care (1 3) and we plan to apply these in the care of CD.
