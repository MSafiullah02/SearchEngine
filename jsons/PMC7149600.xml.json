Stem cells are endowed with seeming unlimited ability to form any cell type. This ability could potentially allow application of stem cells to treatment of a wide variety of medical conditions. Successful management of previously untreatable disease seems feasible. The challenges of translating the promise of stem cells from successful basic scientific research into clinical use are great, but the FDA is prepared to work with the scientific community to bring safe and effective stem-cell therapies into the medical armamentarium. The molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell self-renewal and commitment to a variety of cell fates pose vexing problems in developmental biology. Nonetheless, FDA regulatory oversight of stem cell\u2013based therapy must address these complexities. Although many of the scientific questions of gene regulation, cell\u2013cell interaction, and mechanisms controlling differentiation are unsolved, the regulatory approach used in the Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies and developed in many parts of the FDA is designed to allow progress in clinical research while ensuring, to the best of our ability, patient safety and protection of patient rights.",

Accordingly, the Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies (OCTGT) employs scientists and clinicians involved in full-time review and some who, in addition to their review responsibilities, also pursue laboratory research programs in areas such as developmental biology. This approach ensures that all aspects of product, preclinical, and clinical development are overseen by staff possessing state-of-the art expertise and scientific judgment. Moreover, substantial experience with the regulation of other emergent technologies such as use of recombinant proteins, gene transfer, and cellular therapies has resulted in a regulatory and policy framework that can meet the challenge confronting medical use of stem cells. Finally, oversight of this novel therapeutic approach benefits from input provided by external expert panels such as the FDA's Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee (BRMAC). For example, the BRMAC convened to consider challenges posed by stem cell\u2013based therapies and has assisted tremendously in development of a regulatory framework for oversight of this field.1\n",

These interactions enrich both FDA staff and members of the regulated community by providing gains in mutual understanding and appreciation of perspectives, outside of formal regulatory interactions. Within the OCTGT, a number of review scientists also maintain active research programs in cell or developmental biology or other areas relevant to stem cells and other products regulated by the FDA. This approach, deemed the research\u2013reviewer model, is a major factor allowing the FDA to maintain state-of-the-art expertise and scientific credibility during the complex task of regulating stem cells and developing policy that affects the entire field of stem cell therapeutic use. Figure 73-1\nillustrates three crucial cellular signaling pathways that are active research areas within CBER's Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies. The Notch-Delta pathway, the BMP pathway, and the Wnt pathway each influence cell fate specification within a variety of medically significant cellular lineages. Some direct examples of relevance to stem cell biology and related cellular therapies are listed at the bottom of the illustration.

For both umbilical cord blood and unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells, the FDA has called for data to determine the feasibility of regulating some of the lower risk uses of HSCs through a standards-based approach.2 This proposed approach requires cell-processing establishments to register, ensure that they meet standards for safety, and use FDA-approved donor screening test kits. Finally, autologous or allogeneic cord blood, peripheral blood, or bone marrow stem cell products will be regulated under IND if more than minimal manipulation occurs, the cell product is combined with a drug or device, or the intended use is considered to be nonhomologous. Although the field of stem cell biology has produced evidence that stem cell activity for a variety of lineages can be demonstrated in cord blood, peripheral blood, or bone marrow cell preparations, the FDA will regard use of these products for anything beyond hematopoietic reconstitution as nonhomologous use until a clearer scientific picture emerges.",

Because stem cells are intended to undergo differentiation before mediating their clinical effect, the problem of what to measure and how to correlate the measurement with a final outcome is a great challenge. Because direct measurement of stem cell potency may be challenging because of lack of appropriate in vitro or in vivo assays, use of other means to demonstrate potency could be adequate for initiation of clinical trials. However, development of a valid potency assay for stem cell product lot release will be required for FDA licensure. It is generally expected that a potency assay will be in place before phase 3.

Depending on the specific stem cell product, a variety of possible approaches can be envisioned. The FDA does not have specific requirements for particular potency assessments and will consider the merits of individual proposals in the context of overall risk\u2013benefit considerations depending on the disease indication and the patient population. Potency can be established using several assays, which should include a quantitative assay but may also include qualitative biologic assays.
