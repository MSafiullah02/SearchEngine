Sentiment analysis, the automatic determination of emotions in text, is allowing us to capitalize on substantial previously unattainable opportunities in commerce, public health, government policy, social sciences, and art. Further, analysis of emotions in text, from news to social media posts, is improving our understanding of not just how people convey emotions through language but also how emotions shape our behaviour. This article presents a sweeping overview of sentiment analysis research that includes: the origins of the field, the rich landscape of tasks, challenges, a survey of the methods and resources used, and applications. We also discuss discuss how, without careful fore-thought, sentiment analysis has the potential for harmful outcomes. We outline the latest lines of research in pursuit of fairness in sentiment analysis.",

            "text": "Sentiment analysis is an umbrella term for the determination of valence, emotions, and other affectual states from text or speech automatically using computer algorithms. Most commonly, it is used to refer to the task of automatically determining the valence of a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, the star rating of a product or movie review, or a real-valued score in a 0 to 1 range that indicates the degree of positivity of a piece of text. However, more generally, it can refer to determining one's attitude towards a particular target or topic. Here, attitude can mean an evaluative judgment, such as positive or negative, or an emotional or affectual attitude such as frustration, joy, anger, sadness, excitement, and so on. Sentiment analysis can also refer to the task of determining one's emotional state from their utterances (irrespective of whether the text is expressing an attitude towards an outside entity). The name sentiment analysis is a legacy of early work that focused heavily on appraisals in customer reviews. Since its growth to encompass emotions and feelings, some now refer to the field more broadly as emotion analysis.",

            "text": "Sentiment analysis, as a field of research, arose at the turn of the century with the publication of some highly influential Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. 1 This initial work was on determining the valence (or sentiment) in customer reviews (Turney, 2002; Pang, Lee, & Vaithyanathan, 2002 ) and on separating affectual or subjective text from more factual and non-affective text (Wiebe, Bruce, & O'Hara, 1999; Riloff & Wiebe, 2003a) . The platform for this work was set in the 1990's with the growing availability of large amounts of digitally accessible text as well as, of course, earlier seminal work at the intersection of emotions and language in psychology, psycolinguistics, cognitive psychology, and behavioural science (Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1957; Russell, 1980; Oatley & Johnson-Laird, 1987) . See Figure 1 (a) for a timeline graph of the number of papers in the ACL Anthology with sentiment and associated terms in the title. (The ACL Anthology is a repository of public domain, free to access, articles on NLP with more than 50K articles published since 1965. 2 ) Figure 1 (b) shows a timeline graph where each paper is represented as a segment whose height is proportional to the number of citations it has received as of June 2019. 3 Observe the large citations impact of the 2002 papers by Turney (2002) and Pang et al. (2002) and subsequent papers published in the early to mid 2000s. Since then, the number of sentiment analysis papers published every year has steadily increased.",

            "text": "Several notable works on the relationship between language and sentiment were carried out much earlier, though. Osgood et al. (1957) asked human participants to rate words along dimensions of opposites such as heavy-light, good-bad, strong-weak, etc. Their seminal work on these judgments showed that the most prominent dimension of connotative word meaning is evaluation (aka valence) (good-bad, happy-sad), followed by potency (strong-weak, dominant-submissive) and activity (active-passive, energetic-sluggish). Russell (1980) showed through similar analyses of emotion words that the three primary dimensions of emotions are valence (pleasure-displeasure, happy-sad), arousal (active-passive), and dominance (dominant-submissive). Ortony, Clore, and Collins (1988) argued that all emotions are valenced, that is, emotions are either positive or negative, but never neutral (Ortony et al., 1988) . While instantiations of some emotions tend to be associated with exactly one valence (for example, joy is always associated with positive valence), instantiations of other emotions may be associated with differing valence (for example, some instances of surprise are associated with positive valence, while some others are associated with negative valence). Even though Osgood, Russell, and Ortony chose slightly different words as representative of the primary dimensions, e.g. evaluation vs. valence, potency vs. dominance, and activity vs. arousal, their experiments essentially led to the same primary dimensions of emotion or connotative meaning. For the purposes of this chapter, we will use the terms coined by Russell (1980) : valence (V), arousal (A), and dominance (D).",

However, it should be noted that these applications have not always yielded beneficial results. Recent advances in machine learning have meant that computer systems are becoming more humanlike in their behaviour. This also means that they perpetuate human biases. Some learned biases may be beneficial for the downstream application. Other biases can be inappropriate and result in negative experiences for some users. Examples include, loan eligibility and crime recidivism systems that negatively assess people belonging to a certain area code (which may disproportionately impact people of certain races) (Chouldechova, 2017) and resum\u00e9 sorting systems that believe that men are more qualified to be programmers than women (Bolukbasi, Chang, Zou, Saligrama, & Kalai, 2016) .

Document and Twitter Streams: Sentiment analysis has also been applied to streams of documents and twitter streams where the purpose is usually to detect aggregate trends in emotions over time. This includes work on determining media portrayal of events by analyzing online news streams (Liu, Gulla, & Zhang, 2016) and predicting stock market trends through the sentiment in financial news articles (Schumaker, Zhang, Huang, & Chen, 2012) , finance-related blogs (O'Hare, Davy, Bermingham, Ferguson, Sheridan, Gurrin, & Smeaton, 2009) , and tweets (Smailovi\u0107, Gr\u010dar, Lavra\u010d, &\u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d, 2014) . There is also considerable interest in tracking public opinion over time: Thelwall, Buckley, and Paltoglou (2011a) tracked sentiment towards 30 events in 2010 including oscars, earth quake, tsunami, and celebrity scandals; Bifet, Holmes, Pfahringer, and Gavalda (2011) analyzed sentiment in tweets pertaining to the 2010 Toyota crisis; Kim, Jeong, Kim, Kang, and Song (2016) tracked sentiment in Ebola-related tweets; Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral (2018) published influential work that showed that false stories elicited responses of fear, disgust, and surprise, whereas true stories elicited responses with anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust; Fraser, Zeller, Smith, Mohammad, and Rudzicz (2019) analyzed emotions in the tweets mentioning a hitch-hiking Canadian robot; and it is inevitable that soon there will be published work on tracking various aspects of the global Covid-19 pandemic.",

Yet another, notable challenge in aggregate analysis such as that in determining public emotional state through social media are the biases that impact positing behaviour. For example, it is well known that people have a tendency to talk more about positive feeling and experiences to show that they are happy and successful (Meshi, Morawetz, & Heekeren, 2013; Jordan, Monin, Dweck, Lovett, John, & Gross, 2011) . In contrast, when reporting about products there is a bias towards reporting shortcomings and negative experiences (Hu, Zhang, & Pavlou, 2009) . It is also argued that there is a bias in favor of report extreme high-arousal emotions because such posts are more likely to spread and go viral (Berger, 2013 ).",

For example, a restaurant review can praise the food served, but express anger towards the quality of service. There is a large body of work on detecting aspects of products and also sentiment towards these aspects (Schouten & Frasincar, 2015; Popescu & Etzioni, 2005; Su, Xiang, Wang, Sun, & Yu, 2006; Xu, Huang, & Wang, 2013; Qadir, 2009; Zhang, Liu, Lim, & O'Brien-Strain, 2010; Kessler & Nicolov, 2009) . In 2014, a shared task was organized for detecting aspect sentiment in restaurant and laptop reviews (Pontiki, Galanis, Pavlopoulos, Papageorgiou, Androutsopoulos, & Manandhar, 2014) . The best performing systems had a strong sentence-level sentiment analysis system to which they added localization features so that more weight was given to sentiment features close to the mention of the aspect. This task was repeated in 2015 and 2016. It will be useful to develop aspect-based sentiment systems for other domains such as blogs and news articles as well. (See proceedings of the ABSA tasks in SemEval-2014, 2015, and 2016 for details about participating aspect sentiment systems. 7 ) As with various task in NLP, over the last year, a number of distant learning based approaches for ABSA have been proposed, for example Li, Bing, Zhang, and Lam (2019) develop a BERT-based benchmark for the task. See surveys by Do, Prasad, Maag, and Alsadoon (2019), Laskari and Sanampudi (2016) , Schouten and Frasincar (2015) , Vohra and Teraiya (2013) for further information on aspect based sentiment analysis.",

They framed the task as follows: Given a tweet text and a pre-determined target proposition, state whether the tweeter is likely in favor of the proposition, against the proposition, or whether neither inference is likely.

Automatic systems have to deduce the likely stance of the tweeter towards the target. Humans can deduce from the text that the speaker is against the proposition. However, this is a challenging task for computers. To successfully detect stance, automatic systems often have to identify relevant bits of information that may not be present in the focus text. For example, that if one is actively supporting foetus rights, then he or she is likely against the right to abortion. Automatic systems can obtain such information from large amounts of existing unlabeled text about the target. 8 Stance detection is related to sentiment analysis, but the two have significant differences. In sentiment analysis, systems determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. However, in stance detection, systems are to determine favorability towards a given target -and the target may not be explicitly mentioned in the text.

For example, the concept of education usually involves a student, a teacher, a course, an institution, duration of study, and so on. The set of related entities is called a semantic frame and the individual entities, defined in terms of the role they play with respect to the target concept, are called the semantic roles. FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, & Lowe, 1998 ) is a lexical database of English that records such semantic frames. 9 Table 1 shows the FrameNet frame for emotions. Observe that the frame depicts various roles such as who is experiencing the emotion (the experiencer), the person or event that evokes the emotion, and so on. Information retrieval, text summarization, and textual entailment benefit from determining not just the emotional state but also from determining these semantic roles of emotion. Mohammad, Zhu, Kiritchenko, and Martin (2015) created a corpus of tweets from the run up to the 2012 US presidential elections, with annotations for valence, emotion, stimulus, and experiencer. The tweets were also annotated for intent (to criticize, to support, to ridicule, etc.) and style (simple statement, sarcasm, hyperbole, etc.). The dataset is made 9. https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/home available for download. 10 They also show that emotion detection alone can fail to distinguish between several different types of intent. For example, the same emotion of disgust can be associated with the intents of 'to criticize', 'to vent', and 'to ridicule'. They also developed systems that automatically classify electoral tweets as per their emotion and purpose, using various features that have traditionally been used in tweet classification, such as word and character ngrams, word clusters, valence association lexicons, and emotion association lexicons. Ghazi, Inkpen, and Szpakowicz (2015) compiled FrameNet sentences that were tagged with the stimulus of certain emotions. They also developed a statistical model to detect spans of text referring to the emotion stimulus.",

These continuous word vectors, also called embeddings, are learned from deep neural networks (a type of machine learning algorithm). However, these approaches tend to require very large amounts of training data. Thus, recent approaches to deep learning rely heavily on another learning paradigm called transfer learning. The systems first learn word and sentence representations from massive amounts of raw text. For example, BERT (Devlin, Chang, Lee, & Toutanova, 2019)-one of the most popular current approaches, is trained on the entire Wikipedia corpus (about 2,500 million words) and a corpus of books (about 800 million words). Roughly speaking, the learning of the representations is driven by the idea that a good word or sentence representation is one that can be used to best predict the words or sentences surrounding it in text documents. Once these sentence representations are learned, they may be tweaked by a second round of learning that uses a small amount of task-specific training data; for example a few thousand emotion-labeled sentences.",

A compilation of work on BERT and its variants is available online. 13 12. Note that BERT and other related approaches can be used not only to generate sentence representations, but also to generate context-sensitive word representations (similar to ELMo). 13. https://github.com/tomohideshibata/BERT-related-papers/blob/master/README.md#multi-lingual Despite the substantial dominance of neural and deep learning techniques in NLP research, more traditional machine learning frameworks, such as linear regression, support vector machines, and decision trees, as well as more traditional mechanisms to represent text features, such as word n-grams and sentiment lexicons, remain relevant. This is notably because of their simplicity, ease of use, interpretability, and even their potential ability to complement neural representations and improve prediction accuracy. Word and character ngrams are widely used as features in a number of text classification problems, and it is not surprising to find that they are beneficial for sentiment classification as well. Features from manually and automatically created sentiment lexicons such as word-valence association lexicons, word-arousal association lexicons, word-emotion association lexicons are also commonly used in conjunction with neural representations for detecting emotions or for detecting affect-related classes such as personality traits and states of well-being (Mohammad & Bravo-Marquez, 2017; Chatterjee et al., 2019; Agrawal & Suri, 2019) . Examples of commonly used manually created sentiment lexicons are: the General Inquirer (GI) (Stone, Dunphy, Smith, Ogilvie, & associates, 1966) , the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad & Turney, 2010; Mohammad & Yang, 2011a) , the NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance Lexicon (Mohammad, 2018a) , and VADER (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) . Commonly used automatically generated sentiment lexicons include SentiWordNet (SWN) (Esuli & Sebastiani, 2006) , Sentiment 140 lexicon (Mohammad, Kiritchenko, & Zhu, 2013) , and NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon . Other traditional text features include those derived from parts of speech, punctuations (!, ???), word clusters, syntactic dependencies, negation terms (no, not, never), and word elongations (hugggs, ahhhh). We will discuss manually and automatically generated emotion lexicons in more detail in Section 5.",

This is evident from the large number of research papers, textual datasets, shared task competitions, and machine learning systems developed for valence prediction over the last decade. tasks received submissions from more than 40 teams from universities, research labs, and companies across the world. The SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets, is particularly notable, because it includes an array of subtasks on inferring both emotion classeses and emotion intensity, provides labeled data for English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets, and for the first time in an NLP shared task, analyzed systems for bias towards race and gender .

The system is based on a supervised statistical text classification approach leveraging a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. Notably, it used word and character ngrams, manually created and automatically generated sentiment lexicons, parts of speech, word clusters, and Twitter-specific encodings such as hashtags, creatively spelled words, and abbreviations (yummeee, lol, etc). The sentiment features were primarily derived from novel high-coverage tweet-specific sentiment lexicons. These lexicons were automatically generated from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags (such as #great, #excellent) and from tweets with emoticons (such as :), :(). (More details about these lexicons in in Section 5). Tang et al. (2014a) created a sentiment analysis system that came first in the 2014 SAT subtask on a tweets dataset. It replicated many of the same features used in the NRC-Canada system, and additionally used features drawn from word embeddings. First Socher, Perelygin, Wu, Chuang, Manning, Ng, and Potts (2013) , and then Le and Mikolov (2014) , obtained significant improvements in valence classification on a movie reviews dataset (Pang & Lee, 2008) using word embeddings. Work by Kalchbrenner, Grefenstette, and Blunsom (2014) , Zhu, Sobhani, and Guo (2015) , Wang, Yu, Lai, and Zhang (2016) , and others further explored the use recursive neural networks and word embeddings in sentiment analysis. Recent work on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis has also explored using recurrent neural network (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) (particularly types of neural network) (Tang, Qin, Feng, & Liu, 2016; Chen, Sun, Bing, & Yang, 2017; Ruder, Ghaffari, & Breslin, 2016) .",

Such an approach to machine learning from pseudo-labeled data is referred to as distant supervision. Suttles and Ide (2013) \u2022 Work on Other Small Sets of Emotions: The ISEAR Project asked 3000 student respondents to report situations in which they had experienced joy, fear, anger, (2014) collected tweets with hashtags corresponding to around 500 emotion words as well as positive and negative valence. They used these tweets to identify words associated with each of the 500 emotion categories, which were in turn used as features in a task of automatically determining personality traits from stream-of-consciousness essays. They show that using features from 500 emotion categories significantly improved performance over using features from just the Ekman emotions. Pool and Nissim (2016) collected public Facebook posts and their associated user-marked emotion reaction data from news and entertainment companies to develop an emotion classification system. Felbo, Mislove, S\u00f8gaard, Rahwan, and Lehmann (2017) collected millions of tweets with emojis and developed neural transfer learning models from them that were applied to sentiment and emotion detection tasks. Abdul-Mageed and Ungar (2017) collected about 250 million tweets pertaining to 24 emotions and 665 hashtags and developed a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN) model for emotion classification.",

For exam-20. http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2013/pages/page04 eva.html ple, sentences can be classified as subjective (having opinions and attitude) or objective (containing facts). This has applications in question answering, information retrieval, paraphrasing, and other natural language applications where it is useful to separate factual statements from speculative or affectual ones. For example, if the target query is \"what did the users think of iPhone 5's screen?\", then the question answering system (or information retrieval system) should be able to distinguish between sentences such as \"the iPhone has a beautiful touch screen\" and sentences such as \"iPhone 5 has 326 pixels per inch\". Sentences like the former which express opinion about the screen should be extracted. On the other hand, if the user query is \"what is iPhone 5's screen resolution?\", then sentences such as the latter (referring to 326 pixels per inch) are more relevant. (See Wiebe and Riloff (2011) for work on using subjectivity detection in tandem with techniques for information extraction.) It should be noted, however, that if a sentence is objective, then it does not imply that the sentence is necessarily true. It only implies that the sentence does not exhibit the speaker's private state (attitude, evaluations, and emotions). Similarly, if a sentence is subjective, that does not imply that it lacks truth. A number of techniques have been proposed to detect subjectivity using patterns of word usage, identifying certain kinds of adjectives, detecting emotional terms, and occurrences of certain discourse connectives (Hatzivassiloglou & Wiebe, 2000; Riloff & Wiebe, 2003b; Wiebe et al., 2004) . Opinion Finder is a popular freely available subjectivity systems (Wilson, Hoffmann, Somasundaran, Kessler, Wiebe, Choi, Cardie, Riloff, & Patwardhan, 2005) . 21 However, there has been very little work on subjectivity detection in the later half of 2010s; likely because of the greater interest in modeling sentiment and emotion directly as opposed to through the framework of subjectivity.",

Nonetheless, many words have a tendency to convey the same sentiment in a large majority of the contexts they occur in. For example, excellent and cake are positive in most usages whereas death and depression are negative in most usages. These majority associations are referred to as prior associations. Sentiment analysis systems benefit from knowing these prior associations of words and phrases. Thus, lists of termsentiment associations have been created by manual annotation. These resources tend to be small in coverage because manual annotation is expensive and the number of words and phrases for a language can run into hundreds of thousands. This has led to the development of automatic methods that extract large lists of term-sentiment associations from text corpora using manually created lists as seeds.

Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower are two commonly used crowdsourcing platforms. 22 They allow for large scale annotations, quickly and inexpensively.

They can learn associations that are relevant to a particular domain (Chetviorkin, Moscow, & Loukachevitch, 2014; Hamilton, Clark, Leskovec, & Jurafsky, 2016) . For example, when the algorithm is applied on a text of movie reviews, the system can learn that unpredictable is a positive term in this domain (as in unpredictable story line), but when applied to auto reviews, the system can learn that unpredictable is a negative term (as in unpredictable steering). They also tend to have higher coverage (include more terms) than manually created lexicons. Notably, the coverage of domain specific terms is often much better in automatically generated lexicons than general purpose manually created lexicons. For example, a sentiment lexicon that is generated from a large number of freely available tweets, such as the Sentiment140 lexicon Mohammad et al. (2013a) , has a number of entries for Twitter-specific languages such as emoticons (:-)), hashtags (#love), conjoined words (loveumom), and creatively spelled words (yummeee). Similarly, sentiment lexicons, such as SenTrop (Hamilton et al., 2016) , can be generated that are appropriate for different historical time periods. 35 Automatic methods can also be used to create separate lexicons for words found in negated context and those found in affirmative context ; the idea being that the same word contributes to sentiment differently depending on whether it is negated or not. These lexicons can contain sentiment associations for hundreds of thousands of unigrams, and even larger textual units such as bigrams and trigrams. Methods for automatically inducing sentiment lexicons rely on three basic components: a large lexical resource, a small set of of seed positive and negative terms (sometimes referred to as paradigm words), and a method to propagate or induce sentiment scores for the terms in the lexical resource. Commonly used lexical resources are: semantic networks such as WordNet (Hatzivassiloglou & McKeown, 1997; Baccianella, Esuli, & Sebastiani, 2010) , 33. LIWC also includes other words associated with categories such as personal pronouns and biological concern. The LIWC dictionary also comes with software to analyze text and predict the psychological state of the writer by identifying repeated use of words from various categories. 34. http://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/anewmessage.html 35. Over time, words can change meaning and also sentiment. For example, words such as terrific and lean originally had negative connotations, but now they are largely considered to have positive connotations.",

            "text": "Word embeddings, which are induced from text corpora, are designed to produce word representations such that if two words are close in meaning, then their representations are close to each other (in vector space). They rely on the idea that words that are close in meaning also occur in similar contexts-distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957; Harris, 1968) . Methods to induce sentiment lexicons from word embeddings propagate sentiment labels or scores from the seed words to other words in the vector space in such a way that the sentiment score of a word is influenced strongly by the sentiment scores of the words closest to it. However, antonymous words are known to co-occur with each other more often than random chance (Cruse, 1986; Fellbaum, 1995; Mohammad, Dorr, & Dunn, 2008) . Thus, to some extent, antonymous words tend to occur close to each other in word embeddings, making them somewhat problematic in the propagation of sentiment. Thus, several approaches have been proposed that make use of word embeddings (as the primary lexical resource) and some sentiment signal (star rating of reviews or seed set of sentiment words). These approaches are of two kinds: (1) those that learn word embeddings with an additional objective function to keep antonymous and differing sentiment word pairs farther away from each other (Maas, Daly, Pham, Huang, Ng, & Potts, 2011; Tang, Wei, Qin, Zhou, & Liu, 2014b; Ren, Zhang, Zhang, & Ji, 2016) ; and (2) those that modify (refine/retrofit) word embeddings post-hoc (Labutov & Lipson, 2013; Faruqui et al., 2015; Hamilton et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017) .",

Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2016b) manually annotated a set of phrases that include negators, modals, degree adverbs, and their combinations. Both the phrases and their constituent content words are annotated with real-valued scores of sentiment intensity using the technique BestWorst Scaling. They measured the effect of individual modifiers as well as the average effect of the groups of modifiers on overall sentiment. They found that the effect of modifiers varies substantially among the members of the same group. Furthermore, each individual modifier can affect the modified sentiment words in different ways. Their lexicon, Sentiment Composition Lexicon of Negators, Modals, and Adverbs (SCL-NMA), was used as an official test set in the SemEval-2016 shared Task #7: Detecting Sentiment Intensity of English and Arabic Phrases. The objective of that task was to automatically predict sentiment intensity scores for multi-word phrases. Below we outline some focused work on individual groups of sentiment modifiers.",

Zhu, Guo, Mohammad, and show that these simple heuristics fail to capture the true impact of negators on the words in their scope. They show that negators tend to often make positive words negative (albeit with lower intensity) and make negative words less negative (not positive). Zhu et al. also propose certain embeddings-based recursive neural network models to capture the impact of negators more precisely. As mentioned earlier, Kiritchenko et al. (2014b) capture the impact of negation by creating separate sentiment lexicons for words seen in affirmative context and those seen in negated contexts. These lexicons are generated using co-occurrence statistics of terms in affirmative context with sentiment signifiers such as emoticons and seed hashtags (such as #great, #horrible), and separately for terms in negated contexts with sentiment signifiers. They use a hand-chosen list of negators and determine scope to be starting from the negator and ending at the first punctuation (or end of sentence).",

Intensifiers such as too and very are modifiers that do not change the propositional content (or truth value) of the predicate they modify, but they add to the emotionality. However, even linguists are hard-pressed to give out comprehensive lists of degree adverbs and intensifiers. Additionally, the boundaries between degree adverbs and intensifiers can sometimes be blurred, and so it is not surprising that the terms are occasionally used interchangeably. Impacting propositional content or not, both degree adverbs and intensifiers impact the sentiment of the predicate, and there is some work in exploring this interaction (Zhang, Zeng, Xu, Xin, Mao, & Wang, 2008; Xu, Wong, Lu, Xia, & Li, 2008; Lu & Tsou, 2010; Taboada, Voll, & Brooke, 2008) . Most of this work focuses on identifying sentiment words by bootstrapping over patterns involving degree adverbs and intensifiers. Thus several areas remain unexplored, such as identifying patterns and regularities in how different kinds of degree adverbs and intensifiers impact sentiment, ranking degree adverbs and intensifiers in terms of how they impact sentiment, and determining when (in what contexts) the same modifier will impact sentiment differently than its usual behavior.",

One of the characteristics of the data is that most of the tweets are negative; thereby suggesting that ironic tweets are largely negative. The SemEval 2014 shared task Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Rosenthal et al., 2014) had a separate test set involving sarcastic tweets. Participants were asked not to train their system on sarcastic tweets, but rather apply their regular sentiment system on this new test set; the goal was to determine performance of regular sentiment systems on sarcastic tweets.

Mohammad, Shutova, and Turney (2016) presented a study comparing the emotionality of metaphorical English expressions with that of their literal counterparts. They found that metaphorical usages are, on average, significantly more emotional than literal usages. They also showed that this emotional content is not simply transferred from the source domain into the target, but rather is a result of meaning composition and interaction of the two domains in the metaphor. Ho and Cheng (2016) analyses a text of English financial analysis reports for the use of emotional metaphors. Rai, Chakraverty, Tayal, Sharma, and Garg (2019) show how models for understanding metaphors benefit from sensing the associated emotions. See work by (Dankers, Rei, Lewis, & Shutova, 2019) on joint models for detecting metaphor and sentiment. (Su, Li, Peng, & Chen, 2019 ) developed a method to detect sentiment of Chinese metaphors. Balahur, Steinberger, Kabadjov, Zavarella, der Goot, Halkia, Pouliquen, and Belyaeva (2010) and Liu, Qian, Qiu, and Huang (2017) showed that automatic sentiment analysis systems often have difficulties in dealing with idioms. Williams, Bannister, Arribas-Ayllon, Preece, and Spasi\u0107 (2015) and Spasic, Williams, and Buerki (2017) show that sentiment analysis in English texts can be improved using idiom-related features. Williams et al. (2015) and Jochim, Bonin, Bar-Haim, and Slonim (2018) annotated lists of 580 and 5000 English idioms, respectively, that are manually annotated for sentiment. Passaro, Senaldi, and Lenci (2019) collected valence and arousal ratings for 45 Italian verb-noun idioms and 45 Italian non-idiomatic verb-noun pairs.",

Thus for languages other than English there are fewer and smaller resources (sentiment lexicons, emotion-annotated corpora, etc.).

Work in Multilingual Sentiment Analysis aims at building multilingual affect-related resources, as well as developing (somewhat) language independent approaches for sentiment analysis-approaches that can be applied to wide variety of resource-poor languages. A common approach to sentiment analysis in a resource-poor target language is to leverage powerful resources from another source language (usually English) via translation. This type of work is usually referred to as Crosslingual Sentiment Analysis.",

Balahur and Turchi (2014) conducted a study to assess the performance of sentiment analysis techniques on machinetranslated texts. Salameh et al. (2015) and conducted experiments to determine loss in sentiment predictability when they translate Arabic social media posts into English, manually and automatically. As a benchmark, they use manually determined sentiment of the Arabic text. They show that an English sentiment analysis system has only a slightly lower accuracy on the English translation of Arabic text as compared to the accuracy of an Arabic sentiment analysis system on the original (untranslated) Arabic text. They also showed that automatic Arabic translations of English valence lexicons improve accuracies of an Arabic sentiment analysis system. 37 Some of the areas less explored in the realm of multilingual sentiment analysis include: how to translate text so as to preserve the degree of sentiment in the source text; how sentiment modifiers such as negators and modals differ in function across languages; understanding how automatic translations differ from manual translations in terms of sentiment; and how to translate figurative language without losing its affectual gist.",

Some learned biases may be beneficial for the downstream application. Other biases can be inappropriate and result in negative experiences for some users. Examples include, loan eligibility and crime recidivism systems that negatively assess people belonging to a certain area code (which may disproportionately impact people of a certain race) (Chouldechova, 2017) and resum\u00e9 sorting systems that believe that men are more qualified to be programmers than women (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) . Similarly, sentiment and emotion analysis systems can also perpetuate and accentuate inappropriate human biases. In fact, recent work has shown that a large majority of sentiment and emotion analysis machine learning systems consistently give different emotionality scores to sentences mentioning different races and genders . Often these biases are across stereotypical lines, for example, marking near-identical sentences that mention African Americans names as being more angry than sentences that mention European American names, and sentences that mention women as being more emotional (more happy / more sad) than sentences that mention men. Thelwall (2018) found that automatic sentiment analysis systems are somewhat less accurate on customer reviews written by men compared to those written by women. D\u00edaz, Johnson, Lazar, Piper, and Gergle (2018) examined several sentiment resources, including word embeddings, to find that several old-age-related terms (and their mentions in text) are marked as having negative sentiment whereas terms associated with the young (and their mentions in text) are often evaluated as being positive. Thus sentiment analysis in the real-world has potential negative implications for the elderly. Sentiment analysis, like other natural language technologies, can be a great enablerallowing one to capitalize on substantial, previously unattainable, opportunities. However, the opportunities can also be used by bad actors for committing maleficence. For example, imagine a world where sentiment analysis of social media posts can easily lead to determining one's position on a wide variety of issues, likes and dislikes, personality traits, as well as the emotional state when most pliable for persuasion (say, to purchase items online or to support a political agenda). Suddenly, we (both as individuals and whole populations) are open for manipulation, deception, and indoctrination. Unfortunately, that world is already upon us. To name just two such instances from the recent past: Facebook was reported to have told advertisers that it can identify teenagers who \"feel stressed, \"defeated, \"overwhelmed, \"anxious, \"nervous, \"stupid, \"silly, \"useless and a \"failure. 38 Cambridge Analytica was accused to illegally extracting profiles of millions of Facebook users and leverage it to sway public opinion in the 2016 US elections (Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison, 2018) . Thus, despite the many benefits of sentiment analysis (such as those stated in the previous section), both the researcher and the lay person have to be on guard for the perils it will inevitably germinate.",

We outlined key challenges for automatic systems, as well as the algorithms, features, and datasets used in sentiment analysis. We described several manual and automatic approaches to creating valence-and emotion-association lexicons. We also described work on sentence-level sentiment analysis. We discussed work preliminary work on sentiment modifiers such as negators and modals, work on detecting sentiment in figurative and metaphoric language, as well as cross-lingual sentiment analysis-these are areas where we expect to see significantly more work in the near future. Other promising areas of future work include: understanding the relationships between emotions, multimodal affect analysis (involving not just text but also speech, vision, physiological sensors, etc), and applying emotion detection to new applications. Natural Language Processing (NLP), the broader field that encompasses sentiment analysis, has always been an interdisciplinary field with strong influences from Computer Science, Linguistics, and Information Sciences. However, over the last decade, NLP and Sentiment Analysis have made marked inroads into other fields of study such as psychology, digital humanities, history, art, and social sciences-sometimes attracting controversy. (For example, see the articles on the so called Digital Humanities Wars. 39 ) A common principle in these advances is that NLP allows for asking old and new questions in these fields by examining massive amounts of text. Over the coming decade, we expect more of this, with the traditional boundaries between NLP and other fields becoming even more blurry, along with a healthy cross-pollination of ideas. Finally, we also expect to see considerable interest in the ethics, fairness, and bias of sentiment analysis systems, as well as the use of sentiment analysis to help identify explicit and implicit biases of people.

They developed an algorithm for binary classification of tweets along the four opposing Plutchik dimensions.Kunneman, Liebrecht, and van den Bosch (2014) studied the extent to which hashtag words in tweets are predictive of the affectual state of the rest of the tweet. They found that hashtags can vary significantly in this regard-some hashtags are strong indicators of the corresponding emotion whereas others are not. Thus hashtag words must be chosen carefully when employing them for distant supervision.As part of the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets, created labeled datasets of English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets. The labels include: emotion intensity scores, emotion intensity ordinal classification, and emotion classes, in addition to valence annotations. As part of the SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext Contextual Emotion Detection in Text,Chatterjee et al. (2019) provide a dataset of dialogues between a user and computer agents that are annotated for the emotions of the user.",

(2018),Al-Khatib and El- Beltagy (2017).Hussien, Tashtoush, Al-Ayyoub, and Al-Kabi (2016) analyzed the effectiveness of using emoticons for distant supervision in Arabic tweets.\u2022 Multimodal Datasets: There is new work on developing word representations not only from text corpora but also from collections of images that the words are associated with (Kiela & Bottou, 2014; Hill & Korhonen, 2014; Lazaridou, Bruni, & Baroni, 2014). (An image and a word can be considered associated if the caption for the image has the word, the image is a representation of the concept the word refers to, etc.) This bridges the gap between text and vision, allowing the exploration of new applications such as automatic image captioning (Karpathy, Joulin, & Li, 2014; Kiros, Salakhutdinov, & Zemel, 2014). Mohammad and Kiritchenko (2018) created a dataset of more than 4,000 pieces of art (mostly paintings) that has annotations for emotions evoked in the observer by the painting (image and title), the title alone, and the image alone. The pieces of art are selected from WikiArt.org's collection for four western styles (Renaissance Art, Post-Renaissance Art, Modern Art, and Contemporary Art). In addition, there is a large body of work on analyzing emotions through videos that analyzes facial expressions, gestures, text transcripts, and vocal features.
