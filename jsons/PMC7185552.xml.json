            "text": "In\ufb02ammation is defined as the biological response of the body to local injury and infection, characterized by redness, oedema, fever, pain, and loss of function. It involves a cascade of events elicited by numerous stimuli that include infectious agents, ischaemia, thermal and physical injury, and antigen\u2013antibody interaction [1]. Even though in\ufb02ammation is the defence mechanism of the body to eliminate or limit the spread of injurious stimuli and heal the wounds, excessive in\ufb02ammation is associated with onset of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, periodontitis, in\ufb02ammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and even cancer such as gall bladder carcinoma [2]. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammation, pain, and fever. Their use is associated with adverse effects like severe gastritis, peptic ulcer, nausea, vomiting, salt and water retention, worsening of renal function in renal or cardiac and cirrhotic patients, hypersensitivity, etc. [3]. Therefore, there is a need for screening and development of anti-inflammatory drugs which are devoid of these unwanted effects. As herbal medicines lack these side effects, the current trend is to conduct investigations on plant-based drugs. According to the World Health Organization, about 80% of the world population still relies mainly on traditional herbal remedies [4].",

Though a defence mechanism, sustained fever has potentially harmful effects such as dehydration, delirium, convulsions, cardiopulmonary strain, localized lesions and other teratological consequences [5]. The most common cause of fever is bacterial infections, and mimicked experimentally by the systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is a major component of Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. The induction of fever involves an array of cytokines [interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), etc.] and other mediators leading to the production of cyclooxygenase-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [6].",

The aim of this work was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties of this formulation using appropriate animal models. This work also aimed at identifying the chemical make-up of this formulation which could help explain its possible mechanisms of action.",

The strategy employed in the identification was a method called diagnostic ion filtering strategy [8]. Briefly the diagnostic ions corresponding to a mother skeleton obtained from reference compounds are used to screen the same type of compounds. Then, the molecular ions of screened peaks are calculated using both negative and positive ion modes. Next, the accurate molecular formula of each peak obtained was applied to screening for a hit against various chemical databases. A most possible structure that contains such a substructure and substituent groups can be determined from these candidates by comparison of characteristic product ions and fragmentation pathways.",

Following carrageenan injection, the development of oedema is believed to be biphasic [9], [10] that eventually leads to signs of inflammation such as oedema, hyperalgesia and erythema. The early phase involves the release of in\ufb02ammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin and bradykinins while the late phase is associated with the release of prostaglandins [10]. It is also known that platelet activating factor and arachidonic acid metabolites play a vital role in the phase 1 of inflammation [11]. The resultant effect leads to increased vascular permeability, which enhances the infiltration of neutrophils and the accumulation of plasma fluid into the interstitial space which leads to oedema [9]. The results of this study reveals that inflammation was inhibited at both phases though the latter phase showed more significance. It was also revealed that the levels of inhibition of inflammation were dose-dependent. The dose of 400 mg/kg body weight gave better results in terms of the reduction of inflammation compared with the control drug of indomethacin at times 3 h, 4 h and 5 h.",

It has been reported that LPS-induced fever in rats is polyphasic with different underlying mechanisms [15]. The response of the animals to the fever depends on the serotype and dose of LPS, injection route and stress, ambient temperature, animal strain, gender differences [16], [17], [18]. Tb of the animals increased 1 h after injection of LPS and peaked at 2 h and 5 h. Though the underlying process of fever initiation and sustenance are multiple, varied and complex, it is believed that LPS causes fever by stimulating peripheral macrophages to synthesize and release pyrogenic cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. These cytokines are transported to the thermoregulatory centre of the anterior hypothalamus and consequently stimulate the production of PGE2. PGE2 ultimately leads to the elevation of temperature, hence fever. PGE2 is a major mediator of fever and present in all phases of the polyphasic LPS-induced fever [16], [19]. NO is also found to be a part of several systems that are involved in Tb regulation and NO acting peripherally has been found to be pyretic [20].",

As earlier mentioned, this formulation contains flavonoids, isoflavonoids, alkaloids, etc. Flavonoids have been found to have anti-oxidative and free radical scavenging activities. They could regulate cellular activities of inflammation-related cells, thus, mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Certain flavonoids modulate the enzyme activities of arachidonic acid, metabolizing enzymes such as phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and the NO producing enzyme, NO synthase. Therefore inhibition of these enzymes by flavonoids leads to reduced production of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and NO, which are crucial mediators of inflammation [21]. Another anti-inflammatory property of flavonoids is their ability to inhibit nuclear factor kappa B transcription activation [22], [23].",

It is also found to have hepatoprotective, cytoprotective, antimicrobial, antioxidative, antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects [25]. I. indigotica has been found useful in preventing and treating influenza, tonsillitis, and malignant infectious diseases [26] especially severe acute respiratory syndrome and H1N1-influenza [27] because of its anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, and immune regulatory functions. P. chinense is a well-known oriental folk medicine as an effective anti-inflammatory, antiphlogistic and antipyretic agent in clinical usage [28]. S. baicalensis is traditionally used for the treatment of inflammation, asthma as well as throat disorders, e.g. cough, tonsillitis and pharyngitis [29].
