In the environment, surfaces become contaminated with viruses through contact with infectious body fluids or the settling of airborne viral particles. For surfaces to serve as sources of viral disease, the involved virus must be able to survive in association with the surface until it encounters a susceptible host. There have been a number of viral outbreaks related to surface-related transmission, such as hepatitis virus,(1, 2) rotavirus,(3, 4) enterovirus,(5, 6) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV).(7, 8)",

Enterovirus and SARS CoV could also be spread when a person touches a surface contaminated with infected droplets and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. In Taiwan, enterovirus 71 caused 78 deaths in a large outbreak in 1998, and reoccurred in recent years.(5, 6) The outbreak was highly related to contact transmission and resulted in the widespread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease among exposed population. For SARS CoV, the outbreak occurred in Taiwan with 73 deaths in 2003. Some evidence reveled that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive swab samples were recovered from frequently touched surfaces in rooms occupied by SARS patients and in nurse stations used by staff.(9, 10) These observations led to speculation that a possible route of SARS CoV transmission was contact with environmental surfaces.",
