The upper airway extends from the nose or mouth to the larynx (Seikel et al. 2005), but its functions, in the context of ventilation, extend to the entire airway. Maintenance of airway volume and ventilation is actively controlled by the centrally coordinated activities of nasal, oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal upper airway muscles and those of the pump muscles. These act in concert with lower airway smooth muscle. Effective breathing requires that the brain coordinates ventilatory functions with cardiovascular function and with other motor acts, e.g., swallowing, postural changes, and speech. Adaptations in breathing must occur appropriately, rapidly, and constantly. Protective and mechanical changes occur in milliseconds. Changes in circulatory gas transport alter breathing within seconds. Other adjustments optimize breathing in tune with changes in growth, aging, metabolism, and the environment. This chapter addresses how each upper airway structure plays critical roles in the dynamic processes of breathing.",

Inspired and expired air is conditioned by the nasal mucosa, whose surface area and blood supply are such that particles are filtered and temperature and humidity are modified. The nasal vascular system can achieve a 25 \u00b0C gradient between the nasal ostia and the nasopharynx (Godfrey 1994), a property that enables air breathing at very different environmental temperatures while maintaining a remarkable constancy of temperature and humidity in the lower airway, thereby optimizing cellular function and ciliary action. Given its vascularity, it is not surprising that the nose is a source of nitric oxide, that trauma to the nasal passages can be induced by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) prongs and other cannulae, and that epistaxis can require hospital admission.\n\n",

It can increase its resistance rapidly, switching on a watery secretion \u201clike a tap\u201d (Godfrey 1994), and can trigger laryngeal closure and reduced ventilatory drive (Editorial 1992). The extreme protective reflex response to nasal irritation is the dive reflex that is typified by apnea with glottic closure, bradycardia, and redistribution of blood flow to the brain, heart, and adrenals (see also Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47) (de Burgh Daly 1997; Editorial 1992). The dive reflex can be triggered by nasal water, tobacco smoke, or ice applied to the trigeminal area (Angell James and de Burgh Daly 1969; de Burgh Daly 1997). Water entry into the nose is dramatic even for adults who \u201csuffer a sense of impending suffocation and the almost impossibility of voluntarily making an inspiratory effort\u201d (de Burgh Daly 1997). Exaggerated dive reflex responses can cause total upper airway closure and cardiac arrest and have been implicated in accidental and deliberately induced deaths (de Burgh Daly 1997).",

            "text": "Nasal breathing in the newborn and infant is the predominant but not obligatory form of breathing and is related to the high position of the epiglottis (Fig. 4.1) (Seikel et al. 2005). There is a nasal cycle whereby resistance alternates from one nostril to the other every 2\u20134 h in 80 % of humans (Widdicombe 1986). Pressure in the axilla or on the lateral chest increases ipsilateral nasal resistance (Widdicombe 1986). Resistance is highest in the regions adjacent to the external ostia, whose dimensions are altered by the alae nasi muscles that cause nasal flaring during exercise hyperpnea and respiratory distress, especially in newborns. Newborn nasal resistance exceeds that of the adult in absolute terms but is less than that of their lower airways. Nearly half of the adult\u2019s total airway resistance is nasal. Thus, minor increases in nasal resistance can produce major overall effects on breathing (Editorial 1992). In adult humans, nasal occlusion results in a switch to mouth breathing in <5 s (Editorial 1992). Both this switch to oral breathing and the resumption of nasal breathing following release of the occlusion are delayed by nasal and pharyngeal anesthesia. Occlusion of the nasal passages in infants results in mouth breathing in ~8 s (range <1\u201332 s) (Editorial 1992; Rodenstein 2004). The response is quicker with advancing age but is decreased in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, more so at 6 weeks than in the newborn period (Editorial 1992). These observations led to a proposal that the response may be related to the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Editorial 1992). In premature infants, the change to oral breathing results in a sixfold increase in pulmonary resistance, which over time might result in fatigue with hypoventilation (Miller et al. 1987). Oral breathing places an increased burden on the lower airway to modify the temperature and humidity of inspired gas, presumably via changes in lower airway vascularity. Preventing nasal breathing can decrease gas exchange and functional residual capacity (FRC) (Editorial 1992). Postoperative nasal packing in adults can lead to arterial hypoxemia, apnea, and sleep disturbance, with the latter also occurring in normal volunteers after local anesthesia of the nasal passages (Editorial 1992). In newborn lambs, nasal obstruction also affects gas exchange, with hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis being observed. These effects are aggravated by carotid body denervation. The impact of nasal obstruction diminishes with advancing age (Editorial 1992). Blockage of the nose (choanal stenosis being an extreme example) can cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Marcus 2000). Human neonates whose nasal resistance is increased by birth trauma or trauma secondary to repeated suctioning breathe orally. They can have cyanotic episodes, stridor, and hypercapnia; these problems disappear with resolution of the nasal injury (Miller et al. 1987).",

Pharyngeal patency is a function of the cavity dimensions (Rodenstein 2004) and the balance between the opening forces exerted by pharyngeal muscle activities and the collapsing ones exerted by the tissue\u2013intrapharyngeal pressure gradient and by pharyngeal mucosal adhesion (Fig. 4.2). Patency is critically influenced by posture. Narrowing occurs with neck flexion and hyperextension and can alter cavity pressures required to achieve flow. Narrowing can also follow an inspiratory occlusion of the mouth/nose (a load) that augments diaphragmatic activity and thus negative pressure within the pharynx. Upper and lower airway afferents induce reflex compensatory change in glossopharyngeal muscles to offset the load effect (Fig. 4.2) (Bailey and Fregosi 2006).\n\n",

            "text": "Obstructive apnea occurs during sleep in ~1\u20134 % of children and adults (Marcus 2000). In children, a persistent partial form of upper airway obstruction, obstructive hypoventilation, is seen (Marcus 2000). In adults, a spectrum of decreased inspiratory airflow is seen in snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, and OSA. Pharyngeal OSA occurs when a critical tissue pressure (P\ncrit) exceeds the intrapharyngeal opening pressure (Fig. 4.2) (Marcus 2000; Dempsey et al. 2010) and is influenced by factors that alter pharyngeal dimensions, namely, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity (less common in children than adults), low subglottic airway volume, and craniofacial structural abnormalities. The major role played by the central motor output to the oral cavity and pharyngeal muscles that modify P\ncrit is emphasized by the fact that OSA occurs only in sleep, predominantly in REM sleep in children (Marcus 2000). The following factors also stress the importance of central control in OSA. Obstructive apnea occurring during mixed apnea in preterm newborns involves a direct central mechanism, as shown by the onset of pharyngeal and/or laryngeal closure before diaphragmatic activation (Idiong et al. 1998) (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47). In adults pharyngeal closure can accompany central apnea (Marcus 2000). Central arousal patterns during OSA differ between children and adults (Marcus 2000). Other factors affecting the incidence of OSA are gender, a familial tendency, and racial/ethnic factors (Marcus 2000). Anti-inflammatory medications can benefit OSA, suggesting a role for inflammation in its etiology (Praud and Dorion 2008). Therapy with NCPAP improves OSA by increasing intrapharyngeal pressure and its transverse diameter (Rodenstein 2004), by augmenting lower airway volume and probably by stimulating breathing via pharyngeal pressure sensors (Angell James and de Burgh Daly 1969). In children and adults with OSA, CPAP therapy can improve their metabolism.",

Without NNS, \u201cthe lungs rapidly fill with these secretions, producing death within a few days\u201d (Thach 2005). When pharyngeal secretions reach a critical volume, neural receptors, in the interarytenoid notch, stimulate the laryngochemoreflex which triggers NNS (Thach 2005). The critical pharyngeal volume for NNS may be increased by applied positive pharyngeal pressure, providing an explanation for the decrease in NNS frequency with CPAP (Thach 2005). In adult humans NNS occurs mainly during expiration. In infants NNS occurs at any time in the respiratory cycle (Thach 2005). Volitional swallowing in adults clears the pharynx and reduces the protective laryngeal adductor reflex. During sleep, the protection provided by NNS and glottic closure is imperfect, and some aspiration is common in normal individuals (Thach 2005). Swallow breaths are short inspirations that precede a swallow, occurring when the upper pharyngeal sphincters are closed (Thach 2005). These breaths are thought to result in pharyngeal air being inhaled as opposed to being swallowed (Thach 2005). The increased gastric air found when positive pharyngeal pressure is applied suggests that CPAP can alter normal pharyngeal clearance mechanisms and infers the need to titrate the applied pressure carefully (Thach 2005). Finally, swallowing may be related to sleep apnea and be part of recovery from sleep apnea (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47) (Thach 2005).",

            "text": "Clinically, grunting is the expiratory noise produced when air flows through a partially closed glottis (Harrison et al. 1968). Total glottic closure is silent but sensed. Physiologically, grunting is a breathing pattern seen throughout life. It consists of a spectrum of degrees and timings of expiratory laryngeal closure, associated with volume retention and increased subglottic pressure, followed by laryngeal opening with a rapid return to baseline end-expiratory volume (EEV) (Figs. 4.5 and 4.6) (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47) (Hutchison et al. 1993). In newborns with respiratory distress, Harrison et al. showed that when grunting was prevented by endotracheal intubation, without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), their oxygenation worsened (Harrison et al. 1968). This finding established the role of airway PEEP and likely influenced the introduction of CPAP therapy. Harrison et al. also focused on venous return (Harrison et al. 1968), stressing the importance of cardiac function in grunting. The outline of the volume\u2013time trace in grunting (Figs. 4.5 and 4.6) resembles that of a volume with a prolonged inspiratory time, as used in artificial ventilation to improve oxygenation. Pre-surfactant, this strategy reduced the required peak inspiratory pressure and decreased the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Today, the maintenance of subglottic volume, the \u201copen lung\u201d approach, is a fundamental tenet of all ventilatory support. In keeping with the concept of alveolar interdependence, airway volume recruitment is achieved not by a maximal prolonged inflation but with an augmented breath (sigh) followed by an expiratory hold, mimicking the volume\u2013time profile of grunting or of airway pressure release ventilation. Spontaneous sighs can be biphasic, with inspiration being interrupted briefly by laryngeal closure. This mechanism may reset vagal afferent feedback, avoiding a Hering\u2013Breuer inflation reflex and possible loss of the acquired volume (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47). In summary, human and animal data emphasize the importance of laryngeal control of expiratory subglottic airway volume. This central control strategy whereby airway pressure is dependent upon volume control has been shown by the study of bubble physics to produce a more stable mechanical system (Hildebrandt 1974). Thus, coordinated central control of laryngeal and pump muscles is a major focus in the control of breathing. This knowledge can be applied in respiratory support (Hutchison and Bignall 2008).\n\n",

            "text": "Behavioral state is a major controlling factor of breathing pattern. In fetal lambs, during the high-voltage electrocorticogram (ECoG) state, apnea (no phasic laryngeal abductor or diaphragmatic activities) and tonic laryngeal adductor activity occur. Laryngeal adductor activity can be enhanced by laryngeal contact with cooled lung liquid, by fetal movements, by \u201carousals,\u201d by swallowing, by uterine contractures, and by fetal hypoxemia. In the low-voltage ECoG state, laryngeal and diaphragmatic activities are similar to those seen postnatally (Harding 1986). Hypercapnia mainly enhances fetal breathing in the low-voltage ECoG state (Harding 1986). In general, active laryngeal retardation of lung liquid egress is reported in the absence of fetal breathing movements and is related to lung growth (Harding 1986). Stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) produces laryngeal closure (Harding 1986) that will prevent aspiration of noxious material, e.g., meconium. The coordination of the acts of fetal swallowing (Harding 1986) and \u201cinspiratory\u201d activities of the respiratory muscles stresses the developmental importance of the controller\u2019s ability to switch patterns rapidly between upper airway closure (laryngeal adduction) with lack of diaphragmatic activity (apnea) and laryngeal abductor and pump activities (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47).",

            "text": "Airway volume is high in the fetus compared to the newborn. It has been speculated that during different fetal behavioral states, the brain is setting the homeostatic limits for high and low airway volume to prepare the fetus for the major needs of subglottic volume control at birth (Hutchison 2007) (see also Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47). Life\u2019s greatest airway volume challenge, the establishment and maintenance of an air-filled airway at birth, is usually overcome without a hitch by breathing patterns whose complexities exceed those used during the majority of adult life. At birth, an incremental breathing pattern retains more inspired volume than is expired (Fig. 4.6) (Hutchison et al. 1994). Incremental breathing shares features with grunting with the addition of timing changes in laryngeal and pump muscle activities at end-expiration when the onset of pump muscle activity occurs before laryngeal muscles open the glottis fully. The result is a decrease in expired volume and an increase in EEV (Hutchison et al. 1994). This incremental mechanical process is aided by the airway stability accrued from the increased end-expiratory positive subglottic pressure that limits the development of a negative airway pressure during inspiration. Given their tendency to chest wall distortion, it is not surprising that incremental breathing can occur in preterm neonates (Eichenwald et al. 1992). Incremental breathing is also seen in gasping during acute cerebral hypoxia\u2013ischemia (Hutchison et al. 2002). Gasping is typified by brief laryngeal abductor and pump muscle activities followed by long periods of laryngeal adductor activity with apnea (Hutchison et al. 2002). Subglottic pressure is increased, maintaining airway volume and likely promoting autoresuscitation (Hutchison et al. 2002).",

Application of acid to the larynx in animals, mimicking chronic aspiration, alters the subsequent response to an applied airway load (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47). During noninvasive ventilation, nonsynchronous delivery of airflow to the upper airway in neural expiration results in laryngeal closure (Rodenstein 2004; Scharf et al. 1978). Thus, noninvasive ventilation and pacing of a paralyzed diaphragm should be applied synchronously with neural inspiration (Rodenstein 2004; Scharf et al. 1978).",

During the unimpeded expiration following a single inspiratory occlusive load, unopposed TA activity can produce laryngeal closure. Thus when no air enters the lung, a compensatory reflex mechanism can prevent expiratory volume loss, maintaining absolute subglottic volume. Lower airway afferent inputs affect glottic size (Bailey and Fregosi 2006). Stretch receptor discharges, induced by PEEP, decrease expiratory TA activity (Harding 1986). By contrast increased expiratory glottic adduction follows rapidly adapting receptor stimulation, e.g., with deflation or irritant stimulation secondary to a pneumothorax (Bartlett 1989), or follows C-fiber stimulation, e.g., with experimental pulmonary edema (Bartlett 1989). Direct and indirect stimulation of chest wall muscle afferents can invoke several flow patterns involving glottic closure (Bartlett 1989; Stecenko and Hutchison 1991).",

            "text": "While pseudoasthma can be fabricated by partial glottic closure (Rodenstein 2004), matching laryngeal control of flow pattern to maintain optimal subglottic airway volume may explain changes reported with true increased airway resistance. Subglottic inspiratory flow limitation in croup is associated with expiratory flow resistance, probably glottic in origin (Argent et al. 2008). Increased lower airway resistance in adult asthmatic patients induces a breathing pattern characterized by laryngeal expiratory flow retardation (Collett et al. 1983; Sekizawa et al. 1987). In adults, resistive loads applied at the mouth also decrease expiratory glottic size (Brancatisano et al. 1985). This change may occur immediately, suggesting that resistive loading, unlike total occlusive (elastic) loading, produces sudden flow changes that stimulate airway receptors to cause laryngeal adduction (Brancatisano et al. 1985). Therapy with CPAP reverses the expiratory laryngeal adduction in some asthmatic subjects, suggesting that airway pressure changes may alter the dynamics between stretch receptor and irritant receptor stimulations, thus changing the breathing pattern (Collett et al. 1983). In normal adults a voluntary deep breath can decrease laryngeal resistance and lower airway resistance (Sekizawa et al. 1987). By contrast, bronchoconstrictive stimulation in normal adults can result in inspiratory and expiratory glottic narrowing (Higenbottam 1980). An increased resistance to inspiratory flow may be advantageous in that more transpulmonary pressure is applied to opening a constricted peripheral airway. If lower airway volume and resistance changes affect laryngeal function, can absence of laryngeal control affect lower airway resistance? Laryngeal bypass during invasive ventilation is associated with atelectasis and with the development of increased lower airway resistance (Hutchison and Bignall 2008). The latter effect may stiffen the conducting airways and thus stabilize total airway volume but demand increased effort. In summary, the data reflect the importance of laryngeal subglottic volume control as a determinant of lower airway resistance and point to interactions between lower airway afferents and coordinated laryngeal and pump muscle activities in this dynamic process (see also Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47).",

By contrast, expiratory TA activity in REM is mainly absent, while PCA activity is variable (Harding 1986). In normal adult humans, expiratory TA activity is absent during stable NREM, while expiratory PCA activity decreases in NREM and is variable in REM (Kuna et al. 1988, 1990).

            "text": "Hypoxia stimulates expiratory laryngeal abduction and increases ventilation in human adults and newborn lambs (England et al. 1982b; Insalaco et al. 1990; Praud et al. 1992). In lambs, the increase in ventilation is dependent upon carotid body input \u2013 a sudden decrease in that input induces expiratory TA activity (Praud et al. 1992). However, animal and human data indicate that the effects of carotid body input vary depending upon central state and the presence/absence of other inputs (de Burgh Daly et al. 1979). If animals are vagotomized and paralyzed, direct carotid body stimulation can induce expiratory TA activity, and exposure to hypoxia after airway vagal blockade or intrathoracic vagal section results in laryngeal adduction (Bailey and Fregosi 2006). In adult humans, the degree of expiratory glottic adduction with hypoxia exceeds that during hypercapnia (England et al. 1982b). Thus, it is argued that the \u201cpure\u201d carotid body reflex response is laryngeal expiratory adduction that will retain airway volume and promote oxygenation. This pure response can be countered by the presence of ventilation which increases airway stretch receptor feedback that results in an overall expiratory laryngeal abduction response. In the author\u2019s view, a unifying explanation for the diverse findings with hypoxia is that the effect of carotid body input is to augment the central coordinated output to laryngeal and pump muscles that is selected under different conditions (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_47). When central depression exists, protective inputs and/or absence of volume-related inputs produce an apneic response with glottic closure that is augmented by hypoxia. This can be seen in the \u201cvagal\u201d preterm infant who is sedated for a surgical procedure. At intubation laryngeal closure and apnea/bradycardia can be triggered. If hypoxemia ensues, the problems are aggravated. When tidal ventilation and airway volume feedback are restored, the impact of any ongoing hypoxemia is to augment breathing. Hering and Breuer found that their volume-related reflexes were active even with hydrogen breathing. This fits the modern focus on ventilation for resuscitation from asphyxia.",

Stimulation can result in profuse secretions, altered patency, and the cardiorespiratory dive reflex. Obstruction can affect gas exchange markedly; thus, a rapid switch to oral breathing is advantageous.Pharyngeal patency can be altered in sleep. Nonnutritive swallowing is vital to minimize aspiration. Therapy with CPAP improves pharyngeal patency in OSA but may alter pharyngeal clearing mechanisms and increase gastric air.Laryngeal closure can protect the airway rapidly. Laryngospasm can be hard to treat.Controlled expiratory laryngeal closure modifies airflow and subglottic airway volume in normal breathing, at the establishment of airway volume at birth or when airway volume is threatened by mechanical, chemical, or central changes.Intrinsically or extrinsically induced changes in central state alter the laryngeal motor outputs in response to mechanical or chemical inputs.Understanding how laryngeal motor functions affect breathing patterns, airway pressures, and gas exchange is at the core of many technical and procedural advances in the provision of resuscitative measures and of invasive and noninvasive respiratory support.\n",
