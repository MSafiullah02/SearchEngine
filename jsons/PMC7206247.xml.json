With the developments of wearable devices, inertial sensors have been widely employed in the field of HAR. The main reasons are threefold: (1) The wearable devices with inertial sensors are convenient while the camera is usually fixed in a specific place. (2) The inertial sensors\u2019 data requires less storage while the camera usually needs large memory for visual data. Besides the storage, processing the videos is also costly. (3) The inertial sensors just record the user\u2019s information, while the video camera contains information of others in the same place, so inertial sensors have inherent advantage of protecting user\u2019s privacy and are more target-specific.",

            "text": "Due to the fast developments in deep neural networks, the performance of human activity recognition has enhanced significantly in recent years. But most of the HAR methods are supervised learning methods [3\u20135]. They can just recognize the classes appeared in training dataset but are incapable of recognizing the classes not appeared in training dataset. Nevertheless, the training dataset can\u2019t contain all the activities, because on the one hand every individual can do plenty of activities, and we can\u2019t collect all the activities before training stage, on the other hand, it\u2019s extremely expensive to annotate an activity and label the training data. Recognizing the classes not appeared in training dataset is defined as zero-shot learning problem which is first proposed in [6]. This study provided a formal framework to solve the problem and a zero-shot learning example for the activity decoding task. In the setting of zero-shot learning, the classes in the training dataset (seen classes) and classes in the testing dataset (unseen classes) are disjoint. So in order to recognize the unseen classes, it needs extra information about the seen and unseen classes. The extra information can be defined as semantic space. After the model have captured the relations between the feature space and semantic space of the seen classes, it can transfer the relations to unseen classes. The main idea of zero-shot learning is to correlate the unseen classes with the seen classes via the semantic space. The semantic space can be divided into 2 categories. One is the text vector space, which includes the word-embedding of the classes\u2019 names and the text description of these classes. The other is the attribute space, where the attributes are defined by human beings.",

            "text": "In recent years, there are many zero-shot learning methods proposed in human activity recognition field. However, these methods have defects in different aspects. In [7], it used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as base classifier to detect attributes, and each attribute needed an SVM classifier. Once the attribute space became larger, the model would become extremely complex. In [8], the model needed to use the testing dataset during the training stage, so the model could just be used in a fixed number of unseen classes. Once a new instance which belonged to neither seen classes nor unseen classes appeared, it would be out of work. In this paper, we present a novel model for human activity recognition in the zero-shot learning task. It outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and is termed as Multi-Layer Cross Loss Model (MLCLM). In this model, it learns a multi-fully connected layers model to project features to the attribute space, and the instance is predicted through a similarity classifier (SC). What\u2019s more, our model is not sensitive to the number of unseen classes, for that it just learns the projection between the feature space and semantic space, and once the semantic representations of new classes are defined, our model can deal with these new classes. The major contributions of this paper are as follows:To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the word-embedding into zero-shot human activity recognition.We propose a novel model and split the problem into two sub-problems, which can optimize the model in two spaces.Sufficient experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and through these results, we analyze how the attribute and word-embedding impact the performance of our model.\n",

One category is inductive zero-shot learning [12\u201315], where the model has no information about the unseen classes except the semantic information. In other words, the unseen classes are uncertain. Kodirov et al. [12] proposed a semantic autoencoder model with a novel objective function to reconstruct the features after the projection from features to semantic space. Romeara et al. [13] applied the mean square loss and Frobenius norm as the objective function to learn a bilinear compatibility model. Liu et al. [14] employed the temperature calibration in the prediction probability and introduced an additional entropy loss to maximize the confidence of classifying the seen data to unseen classes. Another category is transductive zero-shot learning [16\u201318], where it can use the information of the unseen classes, including feature space and semantic space. The above methods are in the field of computer vision. In zero-shot learning for human activity recognition scenario, several methods have been proposed [7, 15, 19]. Chen et al. [7] proposed an inductive zero-shot learning method. In [7], for each attribute, it learned an attribute probability classifier (SVM). It then got the class representation in the semantic space and predicted label with the maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP). Cheng et al. [19] proposed an extended work following [7], it changed the SVM to CRF to improve the performance. Wang et al. [15] proposed a model which learned a nonlinear compatibility function between the semantic space and feature space and classified an instance to the class with the highest score.",

However, the second entropy loss can cause misclassification of seen data on unseen classes, which may cause an underfitting problem. The SAE uses an autoencoder model, and it reconstructs the features which are projected to the semantic space. However, even when the reconstruction is perfect, the classification results don\u2019t benefit from the reconstruction. In the DAP, it assigns an SVM classifier for each attribute. Assembling all results of SVM classifiers, the features are projected to the semantic space, and the prediction is made by the maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP). However, each SVM classifier only concentrates on its attribute and ignores the relations of the attributes and the truth label. In other words, it doesn\u2019t optimize directly on the classification results, which can cause overfitting on the attribute classification but underfitting on the class classification results. The ESZSL also has the problem that it is only optimized on the semantic space, but not on the class classification results. The NCBM learns a nonlinear compatibility function, which gives the compatibility scores of the input and all class prototypes, and the class with the highest score is the result of the input. The optimization of NCBM is the hinge loss, which is not sensitive to the outliers, however, the unseen classes are outliers to the seen classes, so this loss can not employ the outliers\u2019 information.",

To find out why the attribute outperforms the word-embedding, we take the PAMAP2 dataset as a representative: we calculate the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC) of these classes\u2019 semantic representations in attributes and word2vec. We find out that the PPMCC of attributes is larger than the PPMCC of word2vec. According to zero-shot learning, the model needs to learn the relations between the feature space and the semantic space in the seen classes, and then it transfers the relations to the unseen classes. So the more relevant between the seen classes and unseen classes in the semantic space, the better the model performs in the testing stage. This conclusion can guide us on how to define the attribute space better for the zero-shot learning task.\n",
