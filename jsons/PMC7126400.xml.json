VEEV causes febrile illness in humans, characterized by fever, malaise, and vomiting. Infection can progress to the central nervous system (CNS), causing neurological symptoms, including confusion, ataxia, and seizures. VEEV infection initiates a biphasic disease: a peripheral phase, where viral replication occurs in the lymphoid and myeloid tissues, and a neurotrophic phase, where viral replication progresses to the CNS resulting in neuropathology and in some cases fatal encephalitis. Encephalitis develops in approximately 4% of cases with an overall mortality of 1\u20132% (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2011).",

Over 200,000 humans were infected with an epizootic strain (subtype IAB) of VEEV during the 1960's outbreak in Columbia (Weaveret al, 2004). VEEV is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) select agent by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Agriculture and as a Category B priority pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases due to its ease of aerosolization, low infectious dose, and potential to cause a major public health threat in the United States (Croddy). In addition, VEEV was previously weaponized by the former Soviet Union and the United States. Various laboratory accidents have been recorded and reports from animal studies indicate that aerosolized VEEV is highly infectious and could possibly result in higher mortality than that noted with natural infection (Franz et al., 2001; Hanson et al., 1967). Currently, there are no FDA approved therapeutics available for the treatment and prevention of VEEV in humans; military personnel and at risk lab workers are vaccinated with the TC-83 strain (Paessler and Weaver, 2009), which is an attenuated strain from the virulent VEEV Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain after 83 serial passages in guinea pig heart cells (Kinney et al., 1993). Since the TC-83 strain of VEEV is attenuated it can be utilized at BSL-2 as a model to better understand VEEV replication and to assist in therapeutic discovery.",

Astrocytes are the major glial cells of the CNS, outnumbering neurons by over five-fold. These cells play an important role in many normal CNS functions, including, supporting and protecting neurons, maintaining homeostatic balance by regulating neurotransmitter and ion concentrations, and providing structural support. Several neurotrophic viruses are capable of infecting astrocytes leading to severe neurological complications and CNS damage (Bender et al., 2012). It is now well established that VEEV infection causes inflammation of CNS. Infection of primary astrocytes with VEEV subtype IAB V3000 (molecular clone of VEEV TrD (Grieder et al., 1995)) or attenuated V3010 (cloned avirulent mutant, E2 76Glu to Lys (Aronson et al., 2000)) released pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS. The attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u0194, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1, which contribute to the inflammatory microenvironment (Peng et al., 2013; Schoneboom et al., 2000).",

The protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR was found to be activated following VEEV infection. EGR1 belongs to the family of immediate early genes, and is a Cys2-His2-type zinc-finger transcription factor associated with growth, cell survival, and apoptosis. Various extracellular stimuli are capable of activating EGR1 mediating cellular stress responses and being a transcription factor, EGR1 promotes the expression of other genes, as well as its own transcription (Pagel and Deindl, 2011). Furthermore, EGR1 is a major mediator and regulator of synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity in both physiological and pathological conditions (Duclot and Kabbaj, 2017a).",

These studies suggest that EGR1 upregulation may be a conserved stress response induced in astrocytes following viral infection. Our prior results demonstrated that the loss of EGR1 resulted in lower susceptibility to VEEV-induced cell death, indicating that EGR1 modulates pro-apoptotic pathways following infection (Baer et al., 2016). However, U87MG cells are a glioma cell line, a characteristic which could potentially lead to significant differences from primary astrocytes in responding to viral infection and replication. Therefore, in the current study, human primary astrocytes were used to determine if EGR1 is activated in primary cells upon VEEV TC-83 infection and to confirm what signaling pathway(s) actively contribute to EGR1 upregulation and apoptosis in VEEV-infected cells.",

            "text": "VEEV infection of U87MG cells induces the PERK arm of the UPR activating EGR1 mRNA and protein expression leading to VEEV-induced cell death or apoptosis (Baer et al., 2016). However, EGR1 expression can also be stimulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (Pagel and Deindl, 2011) and there is significant crosstalk between MAPK signaling and the UPR (Darling and Cook, 2014). To determine if ERK, p38, PI3K, or PERK are necessary for EGR1 induction, we tested well characterized small molecule kinase inhibitors. EGR1 transcripts were significantly downregulated in both mock and VEEV-infected cells treated with an ERK inhibitor (ERKi, PD0325901). Over a 6-fold decrease in EGR1 gene expression (mean= 0.058 fold change) was observed in ERKi treated and VEEV-infected cells compared to DMSO treated and VEEV-infected (mean=6.35 fold change, p-value equals 0.0001) (Fig. 3\nA). Similarly, treatment with a PERK inhibitor (PERKi, GSK2606414) also suppressed EGR1 expression in VEEV-infected cells by over four-fold (mean= 3.02 fold change) compared to DMSO treated and VEEV-infected cells (mean=7.62 fold change, p-value equals 0.0003) (Fig. 3C). Treatment with a p38MAPK inhibitor (p38MAPKi, SB203580) had no significant impact on EGR1 expression (n.s.) (Fig. 3A). Treatment with PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki, PI-103) elevated EGR1 expression (mean= 17.8 fold change) compared to DMSO treated and VEEV-infected cells (mean=11.3 fold change, p-value equals 0.049) (Fig. 3B). Overall, these results demonstrate that EGR1 expression is induced following VEEV infection through ERK- and PERK-dependent pathways. Since ERK and PERK inhibitors had a major impact in suppressing EGR1 expression, subsequent studies focused on ERK and PERK pathways.",

Cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting ERK1/2, PERK, or siNeg followed by VEEV infection. At 36hpi, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter Glo assay and caspase 3/7 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay. Less than 50% of cells were viable in siNeg-transfected and VEEV-infected cells (Fig. 7\nA and C). Cells transfected with siERK1/2 and VEEV-infected had cell viability over 78% (p value equals 0.003) (Fig. 7A). Similarly, cells transfected with siPERK and VEEV-infected had a significant improvement in cell viability (Fig. 7C). Caspase-3/7 activity was highly impacted in cells transfected with siERK1/2 or siPERK and VEEV-infected. A dramatic reduction in VEEV induced apoptosis was observed in siERK1/2 transfected cells by nearly 3-fold compared to siNeg-transfected cells (p-value equals 0.0001) (Fig. 7B). Similarly, nearly 4-fold reduction in VEEV induced apoptosis was observed in siPERK transfected and VEEV-infected cells compared to siNeg transfected and VEEV-infected cells (p-value equals 0.0001). No visible CPE was evident in siERK1/2 or siPERK transfected and VEEV infected cells even after 36hpi when observed under microscope (data not shown). These data indicate that loss of PERK and ERK impedes VEEV induced cell death.",

A caveat of our current work is that all of our data were produced using infection of primary astrocytes with VEEV TC-83. VEEV TC-83 is a live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV that has investigational new drug status and can only be used for vaccination of animals and individuals, such as military personnel, that are at risk for VEEV exposure (Sharma and Knollmann-Ritschel, 2019). While VEEV TC-83 replicates efficiently in vitro\n, it has limited pathogenicity in mouse models of infection with most strains of mice surviving infection and displaying less severe brain pathology as compared to VEEV TrD infection (Steele et al., 1998; Hyde et al., 2014). However, our current data coupled with our previous work indicate that EGR1 upregulation and its subsequent induction of apoptosis are induced by both VEEV TC-83 and TrD infections.",

            "text": "Our data also indicate that EGR1 expression following VEEV infection was dependent on both the ERK and PERK signaling pathways which was determined by inhibitor treatments and confirmed by siRNA transfections. ERK signaling is a central MAPK pathway and ERK proteins are critical members of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, activated by various stimuli, and play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, learning, and sometimes apoptosis (Shaul and Seger, 2007). The ERK proteins are abundantly expressed throughout the brain (Zsarnovszky and Belcher, 2004) and the ERK pathway has been shown to activate EGR1 induced by nerve-growth factor, which in turn mediates p35 induction, leading to neuronal differentiation (Harada et al., 2001). Activated ERK is known to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues of more than 50 downstream cytosolic and nuclear substrates (Seger and Krebs, 1995; Pearson et al., 2001). Amoung these substrates, ERK phosphorylates the transcription factor Elk-1 (Cargnello and Roux, 2011), which in turn induces EGR1 gene expression (Tur et al., 2010; Duclot and Kabbaj, 2017b). Previous work has shown the MAPK transduction pathways as key players in the cell death of rat cortical astrocytes (Fernandes et al., 2007), which is in agreement with our results. EGR1 activation and upregulation via the ERK signaling cascade has also been observed in melanoma cells (Gaggioli et al., 2005), prostate cancer cells (Gregg and Fraizer, 2011), and in breast cancer cell lines (Wenzel et al., 2007), implying that EGR1 induction may be a conserved stress response not only in astrocytes, but also other cell types.",

The PERK pathway of the UPR, is involved in both survival and apoptotic signaling. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 prevents ER stress-induced apoptosis whereas, under severe cell ER stress, the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway activates transcription of pro-apoptotic factors, such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD34 enhancing apoptosis signaling (Kadowaki and Nishitoh, 2013; Novoa et al., 2003). Indeed, in VEEV-infected U87MG cells, CHOP expression was induced (Baer et al., 2016). Our data suggest that PERK activity is stimulated following infection due to the accumulation of large amounts of viral glycoproteins in the ER causing ER stress which can activate UPR signaling cascades (Steele et al., 1998), ultimately leading to EGR1 activation in infected cells (Bender et al., 2012).",

Inhibition of ERK signaling through small molecule inhibitors was previously shown to suppress VEEV replication (Voss et al., 2014), supporting the importance of the ERK pathway for VEEV replication. These data indicate that blocking EGR1 alone is not sufficient to dramatically impact VEEV replication, in agreement with our previous data where VEEV TrD replication in wildtype and EGR1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs_) was comparable (Baer et al., 2016). Given that ERK phosphorylates more than 50 substrates (Seger and Krebs, 1995; Pearson et al., 2001) and PERK stimulates multiple signaling components including other transcription factors (ATF4, Nrf2, CHOP (Hughes and Mallucci, 2019)) the observed impact on viral replication may be peripheral to their regulation of EGR1 gene expression. Alternatively, since a modest impact on viral replication was observed following loss of EGR1, a combination of multiple ERK or PERK regulated factors may be needed to strongly impact VEEV replication. However, loss of EGR1 was sufficient to reduce VEEV induced apoptosis, indicating that its role is related to regulation of cell death pathways rather than impacting viral replication.",

On one hand, VEEV infection leads to activation of the ERK signaling cascade in cells (Voss et al., 2014), activating EGR1 gene expression. While on the other hand, viral infection leads to ER stress in cells, activating the PERK arm of the UPR pathway which in turn contributes to EGR1 activation. (Baer et al., 2016). Previous studies have shown significant cross talk between ERK signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress in cancer, atherosclerosis, and ischemia. During ER stress, PERK and ATF6 promote ERK and p38 phosphorylation thus boosting pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in bronchial epithelial cells (Mijo\u0161ek et al., 2016). However, ERK phosphorylation is induced at early time points (5 min to 6 h) following VEEV infection, suggesting that there is an early induction of ERK activity (Voss et al., 2014) and a later ER stress stimulated ERK activity in VEEV infected cells. Activated EGR1 then translocates to the nucleus leading to the activation of various EGR1 regulated genes ultimately contributing to apoptosis. Blocking the ERK or PERK pathways suppresses EGR1 gene expression, which in turn can block viral-induced apoptosis leading to cell survival. The mechanism by which EGR1 contributes to apoptosis is largely unknown. Ongoing studies in our lab are aimed at identifying EGR1 responsive genes to begin to elucidate EGR1-dependent gene expression changes that contribute to VEEV-induced cell death.",
