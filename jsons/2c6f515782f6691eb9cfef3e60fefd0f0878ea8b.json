            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of hepatitis, and nearly 240 million people are infected worldwide. 1 HBV is associated with hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 2,3 HBV is a DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family and encodes 7 proteins: 5 structural and 2 nonstructural proteins. The structural proteins include 3 envelope proteins (small, middle and large surface proteins), capsid protein and polymerase. The nonstructural proteins include HBeAg (secreted e antigen) and HBx (hepatitis B virus X protein). 4 HBx is a nonstructural protein with a molecular weight of 17.5 kDa. HBx functions as a multifunctional protein that interacts with various transcription factors and cell cycle-related regulatory proteins, adjusting the intracellular environment to optimal conditions for viral production. [5] [6] [7] Interestingly, its intracellular distribution varies depending on its expression level in cells. For example, HBx was detected in the nucleus at a low expression level, while it was distributed throughout the cytoplasm at a high expression level. 6 HBx has been reported to target the mitochondrial outer membrane, but not the endoplasmic reticulum, the plasma membrane or lysosomes. 6, 8 Mitochondrial outer membranelocalized HBx is known to alter mitochondrial morphology, fission and aggregation. 9 HBx also induces intracellular ROS production 9,10 and mitochondrial depolarization in hepatoma cells, leading to disruption of mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis. HBx induces mitochondrial membrane permeability, resulting in cytochrome c release and mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload that cause apoptosis. 11, 12 Although the role of HBx in the mitochondria is not fully understood, it is clear that mitochondrial outer membrane-localized HBx exerts a different role than nuclear-targeted HBx, which functions in transcriptional activation.",

However, the function of HBx on the mitochondrial outer membrane has not been well evaluated. As the exact function of HBx on the mitochondrial membrane is challenging to evaluate in cells, we attempted to investigate HBx function using a recombinant HBx protein and an artificial membrane system. We synthesized recombinant HBx protein in E. coli and recovered its biological activity through a rational refolding method, as previously reported. 17 The purity of the refolded recombinant HBx protein was examined via Coomassie blue staining (>95%), and it was further confirmed by anti-HBx and anti-His antibodies ( Figure 1A ,B). As HBx was shown to be inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane via its transmembrane domain (residues 53-70), we generated liposomes with a rat liver mitochondrial outer membrane composition, as previously reported. 18, 19 To observe the HBx localization in liposomes, we prepared mitochondrial outer membrane-mimic giant unilamellar vesicles (MOM-GUVs) including ATTO 390-DOPE. We treated the recombinant HBx protein for 2 minutes, and HBx-targeted MOM-GUVs were then stained with nickel-nitrilotriacetate conjugated to ATTO 488 fluorescent dye (NTA-ATTO 488) for the detection of poly-Histagged HBx by fluorescence microscopy. As expected, the recombinant HBx protein was shown to target the MOM-GUVs ( Figure 1C ).",

Using phase contrast microscopy, we found that MOM-GUVs became transparent after treatment with HBx in a time-dependent or concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2A To quantify the HBx-induced membrane permeabilization, we performed a liposome permeabilization assay; these are generally used in viroporin studies to evaluate pore-forming activity. 21 As CF is self-quenched at high concentrations and becomes fluorescent at low concentrations, we made CF-LUVs with the lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Recombinant HBx protein added to CF-LUVs caused liposome permeabilization in a time-dependent or concentration-dependent manner, similar to its activity on GUVs ( Figure 3A ,B). We also tested the HCV p7 protein (a known cause of membrane permeabilization) as a positive control. 19, 22 These results indicated that HBx directly induces membrane permeabilization, independently of other cellular proteins.",

As an artificial membrane system without any cellular proteins was used, we hypothesize that this membrane permeabilization is mediated by HBx only. We excluded the possibility of HBx as an ion channel protein (viroporin) because its predicted secondary structure is far different from that of the viroporins, which have 1 or 2 alpha-helical transmembrane domains. We questioned the means by which HBx could trigger membrane permeabilization in this artificial liposome system, but to elucidate the exact mechanism, more extensive studies are required. However, we suggest 1 possibility based on the previous studies in which cytochrome c, the protein of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, was reported to induce membrane permeabilization and it shows (or was suggested to have) the \"channel-pore dualism,\" which is regarded as a viroporin phenomenon. 37, 38 We found that HBx permeated CF, which has a 0.6-nm Stokes radius (Figure 3 ). However, HBx is not classified as an ion channel protein. 38 Cytochrome c interacts with specific lipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane to induce lipid pore formation. 38 It was thus shown to induce membrane permeabilization, releasing CF and 10-kDa dextran from liposomes.

Interestingly, HBx-induced membrane permeabilization was not inhibited by adamantane derivatives (amantadine and rimantadine), whereas NN-DNJ inhibited HBx-induced membrane permeabilization independently of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex ( Figure 4 ). Membrane permeabilization induced by the HBx protein was observed in the artificial membrane system, and it now needs to be confirmed in cells. However, it is difficult to confirm this finding in cells because the mechanism behind HBx-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is very complex and has not been well elucidated yet. Instead, we showed that NN-DNJ inhibited HBx-caused mitochondrial depolarization in Huh-7 cells ( Figure 5 ).",

From the combined results, we can suggest that the NN-DNJ effect on HBV may be related to membrane permeabilization by HBx, and additional experiments to support this hypothesis are needed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HBx induces membrane permeabilization, and that this effect is inhibited by 1 viroporin inhibitor and by 2 triply-charged lanthanides. It is possible that other viroporin inhibitors or nonselective channel blockers also inhibit HBx activity. In the present study, we identified a novel function for HBx, demonstrating its direct role in inducing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Based on the results obtained in this study, we propose that HBx-induced membrane permeabilization may be an attractive therapeutic target for HBV treatment. ",
