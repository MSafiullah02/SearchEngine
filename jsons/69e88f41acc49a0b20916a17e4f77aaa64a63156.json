In addition, simultaneous detection and differentiation of enteroviruses and parechoviruses would be beneficial because of a similar clinical picture presented by these viruses. A sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR protocol that can address these clinical needs would be valuable to molecular diagnostic laboratories. Here we report a multiplex nucleic acid based assay using hydrolysis probes targeting the 5 0 nontranslated region for the detection and differentiation of enteroviruses and parechoviruses without cross-detection of rhinoviruses. This assay has been shown to detect enteroviruses belonging to the different species in a variety of specimen types without detecting the different species of rhinoviruses. Laboratory validation shows the assay to be sensitive, specific, reproducible, easy to set up and uses generic cycling conditions. This assay can be implemented for diagnostic testing of patient samples in a high throughput fashion.",

HPeV-1 and HPeV-2, were formerly classified in the Enterovirus genus as echovirus 22 (E-22) and 23, respectively. Another isolate, CT86-6760, originally classified as E-23/HPeV-2 (based on serological cross-reactions) has been re-classified as HPeV-5. The genus Enterovirus consists of 12 species of which Enterovirus A, Enterovirus B, Enterovirus C, Enterovirus D, Rhinovirus A, Rhinovirus B and Rhinovirus C cause human disease. The three poliovirus (PV) serotypes now belong to the species Enterovirus C (www. Piconaviridae.com; [1, 7, 20] ).

Several RV types circulate continuously and differentiation of RV and EV infections is often clinically important. Specific identification of these viruses can have implications for the supportive management of patients and can become more significant when specific antiviral drugs become available. This has been highlighted in the CDC health advisory on the recent outbreak of EV-D68, where samples that test positive by commonly used assays that are unable to distinguish between EVs and RVs have to be further tested for the confirmation of EV-D68 (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/han/han00370.asp).

            "text": "Enteroviruses are common and important human pathogens. Although the majority of infections are asymptomatic, EVs cause several severe illnesses. Molecular methods, especially real-time RT-PCR, have become the diagnostic modality of choice given the rapid turn around time and the high sensitivity provided by these methodologies as previously reported [2, 3, 6, 14, 19] . The 5 0 NTR has been the most commonly chosen target because of the high degree of conservation among different EV types; the origin of this high conservation stems from the secondary structure required for the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) function of the 5 0 NTR. Unfortunately, this high conservation also extends to a high homology with the 5 0 NTR of RVs, and many RT-PCR assays for EVs cross detect at least some of the RVs. In this study we designed and validated a set of primers and probes that do not cross-detect RVs, and can detect all the 64 \"classical\" EVs as well as numerous newly described EVs up to EV-B101, with a high sensitivity. Such lack of cross detection is particularly useful for specific laboratory diagnosis of respiratory samples since both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses commonly infect the respiratory tract. Infection of the respiratory tract by rhinoviruses is more prevalent than enteroviruses and to ensure the detection of rhinoviruses, the algorithm used in our laboratory includes initial testing by the respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay from Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (Austin, TX, USA). This assay can detect both enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, however it cannot distinguish them. The assay described in this manuscript is used for this differentiation when the clinical picture warrants an enterovirus-specific assay. The assay described in the manuscript is also used for the specific detection of enteroviruses and parechoviruses in samples such as blood and CSF as the front line assay.",

Caution must however be exercised in that regard; already, several isolates of the newly designated EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, EV-C117 and EV-C118, which have been shown to constitute a new clade within species C [5, 11, 17, 21, 22] display important differences in the sequence of their 5 0 NTR and several RT-PCR assays targeting the 5 0 NTR [7] have failed to detect them [17, 21] . Based on sequence comparison of our primers and probes and the sequences of these isolates, we would predict that our assay would also fail to detect these viruses. The exact geographic distribution and clinical frequency of viruses in this new clade remains to be established. Given the difficulties of designing a comprehensive assay for the detection of EVs that does not cross react with RVs, we would argue that the best way to improve our current assay in order to detect this new clade would be to add primers and probe specific for this clade to the multiplex mix. Further work will be required towards this goal.",
