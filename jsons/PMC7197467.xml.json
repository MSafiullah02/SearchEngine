The threat of newly emerging pathogens is also a concern for aquaculturists. The rapid diagnosis and prevention of diseases of fish and shellfish in culture systems is important in fish husbandry. Efficient management of disease usually begins by preventing the spread of disease. Disease diagnosis has been mainly based on clinical signs supported by isolation and identification of the aetiological agent. This requires a rapid and sensitive method to detect pathogens. On\u2010farm laboratories are not usually equipped with diagnostic equipment, thus small\u2010scale aquaculture operations depend on specialist fish disease laboratories for their diagnostic needs. However, laboratories routinely handling diagnostic cases are often very busy and take time to carry out diagnoses. In order for laboratories to handle large number of samples sensitive and rapid diagnostic kits are needed.",

An excellent review on molecular diagnostics used to detect pathogens associated with fish and shellfish diseases has been published by Cunningham (2002). Various techniques, including restriction digestion of nucleic acid, nucleic acid hybridization and DNA amplification technology are currently being used. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real\u2010time PCR have gained a wide popularity as a diagnostic tool. The advantage of PCR over other nucleic acid techniques is the ease of development of the detection system, its high sensitivity and rapidity.",

This method amplifies target DNA from a few copies to 109 copies in less than an hour under isothermal conditions. It is an offshoot of the basic strand displacement techniques which have been described thoroughly (Notomi et al. 2000). Briefly, four highly specific primers are constructed from the target DNA, one set of primers anneal to the target region one after the other on the same strand and the primer which anneals at the later stage displaces the strand formed by the first primer with the help of Bst DNA polymerase. The Bst polymerase has a strand displacement activity. This takes place on both strands and the primers are designed such that loops are formed. The reaction is carried out under isothermal conditions as denaturation of the strand takes place by strand displacement. The reactions produce a series of stem\u2010loop DNAs with various lengths. The four primers hybridize against six distinct sequences in the target DNA making it highly specific.",

The technical specifications of each primer and the optimized annealing temperatures are described in detail by Notomi et al. (2000). The primers can be developed using Primer Explorer version 3 software (http://primerexplorer.jp/lamp3.0.0/) specifically designed to develop LAMP primers. By using additional sets of loop primers, the reaction time of LAMP can be further accelerated (Nagamine, Hase & Notomi 2002). Using loop primers the time required is reduced by half, making it a more efficient tool in disease diagnostic applications.",

The template DNA for LAMP is denatured for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C before setting up the LAMP reaction for isothermal amplification (Notomi et al. 2000). However, studies have shown that non\u2010denatured templates can also be used directly for LAMP\u2010mediated detection (Nagamine, Watanabe, Ohtsuka, Hase & Notomi 2001). The LAMP reaction is carried out at 60\u201365 \u00b0C for 45\u201360 min and the reaction terminated at 80 \u00b0C for 2 min (Fig. 1).

            "text": "Several methods may be used to check for the LAMP reaction. The products are commonly visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis stained with an intercalating agent such as ethidium bromide or SYBR Green I. As the LAMP reaction produces products of various lengths of stem loop structures, the gel will show products from the minimum length of target DNA to the loading well, which appears as a smear and bands at the base of the gel. Because amplification of the target DNA is so high at the final stage it is vulnerable to contamination in subsequent amplifications. However, an advantage of the large amount of product that is generated is that it can be visualized on a UV\u2010transilluminator by incorporating intercalating agents directly into the LAMP\u2010amplified tubes (Notomi et al. 2000). Another method is by assessing the amount of white precipitate formed from magnesium pyrophosphate (Mori, Nagamine, Tomita & Notomi 2001). The DNA formed by amplification of prostate\u2010specific antigen by PCR for 35 cycles and LAMP for 60 min at 65 \u00b0C was 0.2 and 11.2 \u03bcg 25 \u03bcL\u22121, respectively (Mori et al. 2001). The huge amount of DNA formed by LAMP allows the detection of turbidity using a desktop centrifuge, as the precipitate accumulates at the bottom of the tube. Negative reactions neither show smearing nor turbidity in the reaction mixture.",

The first report of the application of LAMP to detect bacterial isolates was by Maruyama, Kenzaka, Yamaguchi, Tani & Nasu (2003). These authors developed a novel strategy using LAMP to detect Escherichia coli from the coastal environment, where the stx gene was detected by an in situ method. The amount of target DNA amplified is enormous and forms chains which cannot exit from the bacterial cell. The presence of huge amounts of target DNA facilitates detection using a nucleic acid probe. Song, Toma, Nakasone & Iwanaga (2005) developed a LAMP assay for Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli by targeting the ipaH gene, with amplification within 2 h starting with as few as 8 CFU. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causing Johne's disease, a chronic progressive enteritis in ruminants, has a wide host range. LAMP primer sets were developed to detect the MAP IS900 fragment and were specific for MAP. Furthermore, the detection was simplified as the turbidity of the reaction allowed visual detection (Enosawa, Kageyama, Sawai, Watanabe, Notomi, Onoe, Mori & Yokomizo 2003). Iwamoto, Sonobe & Hayashi (2003) also developed an accurate detection assay for the M. tuberculosis complex, M. avium and M. intracellulare from sputum samples using LAMP. Detection of Legionella (Annaka 2003) and the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Maeda, Kokeguchi, Fujimoto, Tanimoto, Yoshizumi, Nishimura & Takashiba 2005) by LAMP was developed by targeting the 16sRNA gene.",

The first use of LAMP for detection of an aquaculture pathogen was reported for edwardsiellosis (Savan, Igarashi, Matsuoka & Sakai 2004). Edwardsiella tarda was detected from infected Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. LAMP primers were designed by targeting the haemolysin gene (Fig. 2). The specificity of LAMP was tested for five different E. tarda strains isolated from eel (E22), tilapia (E 381), flatfish (FPC 498), water from eel culture ponds (SU226) and sea bream (158). Non\u2010specific amplification was not seen in other enteric bacteria and those which produce enterotoxins. The optimum amplification regime for a clear visible banding pattern was at 65 \u00b0C for 45 min. Edwardsiella tarda could be detected from 10 and 103 CFU by LAMP and PCR, respectively. Thus, in this case, LAMP\u2010based detection was much more sensitive than PCR. Furthermore, LAMP could detect the pathogen from Japanese flounder pond water with an E. tarda count of 3.8 \u00d7 102 CFU. A LAMP\u2010based diagnostic system has been recently developed for detection of E. ictaluri from diseased catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Yeh, Shoemaker & Klesius 2005). The LAMP primers were designed targeting the eip18 gene. The LAMP reaction amplified six different strains of E. ictaluri. Non\u2010specific amplification was not observed when tested with 12 other bacterial strains associated with channel catfish. The detection limit by LAMP was 20 CFU, more sensitive than real\u2010time PCR and traditional biochemical assays (Bilodeau, Waldbieser, Terhune, Wise & Wolters 2003). Edwardsiella ictaluri could be detected using genomic DNA from infected brain samples as template. The LAMP method has also been applied to the detection of nocardiosis (Kawakami, Kono & Sakai 2005). Nocardiosis is a serious pathogen affecting yellowtail, Seriola quinqueradiata, and amberjack, S. aureovittata. Nocardial diagnosis has been mainly achieved by isolation and biochemical identification. Recently, PCR detection has been possible for nocardiosis (Kono, Ooyama, Chen & Sakai 2001; Miyoshi & Suzuki 2002). In these studies, the detection limits by LAMP and PCR were 103 and 104 CFU, respectively. Compared with PCR a 10\u2010fold higher sensitivity is seen using LAMP. Furthermore, LAMP detection was superior to PCR when spleen DNA extracted from infected fish was used as template.",

The detection limit of the viral DNA template was at the 10 fg level, whereas nested PCR\u2010mediated detection was limited to the 100 fg level. Detection by LAMP was superior to PCR in that it was faster and more sensitive. LAMP\u2010mediated detection for koi herpes virus (KHV) by targeting the thymidine kinase (tk) gene (AJ535112) has been developed. The detection limit was found to be similar to PCR primers targeting the tk gene from infected common carp, Cyprinus carpio (Gunimaladevi, Kono, Venugopal & Sakai 2004). Screening for KHV has become very important as trade of fancy carp is an easy route for geographical spread of the virus and a rapid and efficient system like LAMP is very suitable for this purpose. LAMP has also been used to detect red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) (Caipang, Haraguchi, Ohira, Hirono & Aoki 2004). The RSIV DNA was amplified using DNA extracts obtained from spleen of infected red sea bream, Pagrus major. The protocol developed is 10 times more sensitive than conventional PCR for detecting RSIV. The authors also showed a correlation between the number of DNA copies of the virus and the corresponding turbidity, which can be used to quantify virus particles in infected fish.",

            "text": "Diagnosis of bacterial infections can be cumbersome because isolation and identification takes time and resources. Bacterial infection with mixed aetiology makes the diagnosis even more complex. Farm managers, together with their previous experience of the clinical signs of diseased fish, rely on diagnostic kits available in the market to detect bacterial agents. The available diagnostic kits are easy to use, do not require expensive equipment but take 12\u201324 h to obtain a result. PCR\u2010mediated detection has been developed for several diseases in aquaculture caused by bacterial or viral agents. The LAMP\u2010mediated diagnosis of edwardselliosis, WSSV, RSIV, IHNV and KHV clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the method as a diagnostic tool. The diagnosis can be based on specific DNA markers as target region for the bacteria. LAMP can also be used for the detection of bacterial resistance to antibiotics by targeting antimicrobial resistance genes. Using LAMP less time is required for detection, allowing more time to use management practices to minimize the spread of disease.",

A major problem lies in the introduction of carriers from imported fish stocks, e.g. introduction of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus/IHNV infected fish into Japan (Yamazaki 1974). Along with robust legislation, a reliable and sensitive diagnostic technique is needed to detect known and emerging pathogens. The development of diagnostic kits based on nucleic acid detection is simpler and more cost\u2010effective than developing virus specific cell\u2010lines.",

Many reports and reviews have been published on the detection of parasites using molecular methods in fish and shellfish (Gasser & Monti 1997; Gasser 1998; Cunningham 2002) including the use of ribosomal RNA genes and spacers by PCR. However, cross\u2010reaction with host tissues because of the presence of complementing conserved rDNA sequences has been suggested as a cause of false\u2010positive results (Perkins & Martin 1999). Using LAMP the specificity could be enhanced as the primers hybridize to six distinct sequences (El\u2010Matbouli & Soliman 2005).",
