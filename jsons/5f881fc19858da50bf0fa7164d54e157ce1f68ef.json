The pandemic led to nationally-recognized surgical care guidelines from the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), [4] [5] [6] which implemented a tiered framework of recommendations to appropriately triage and plan for a surge of COVID-19 cases.

Orthopaedic complaints generated a large proportion of urgent hospital visits; between 17% and 26% of all cases presented to the ED were due to musculoskeletal complaints.

The preliminary success of the OWICs was determined by comparing the number of non-emergency orthopaedic referrals generated by the ED both before and after the implementation of the OWICs.

Following initial screening, patients were brought to an examination room and seen by a RN, PA or NP triage staff, where their vitals were taken and they were assessed for urgency of orthopaedic complaints. Once a patient was deemed appropriate for the OWIC, a brief history was obtained by the triage staff and then referred to the provider (PA, NP, or orthopaedic surgeon). The provider examined and treated the patient as necessary, with access to onsite radiology, splinting, and casting capabilities, and same-day physical therapy referrals.

In preliminary results, the OWICs provided for urgent orthopaedic patients to be seen safely and in a timely manner. The clinical management protocol included patient triaging, examining, treating, and scheduling follow-up all within the same visit. With a decreased number of scheduled surgeries in the department, the orthopaedic group at the hospital system was able to adapt quickly and rearrange staff schedules to operate two fully staffed OWICs. Through this preliminary work, we showed that the OWICs are associated with a statistically significant decrease in the number of musculoskeletal referrals made from the ED, allowing redirection of staff and resources to better address the COVID-19 surge. Additionally, we demonstrated that it is possible to rapidly develop an OWIC using existing resources found at most orthopaedic surgery clinics. We also illustrated how a number of staff at an orthopaedic surgery clinic may be repurposed during a time of severely diminished elective patient care.",

If additional specialty providers created their own clinics to relieve the pressure on the ED, the benefits could be augmented. When transitioning back to reopening the clinic and offices, our orthopaedic department has planned to continue the OWICs as a community resource, staffing it with a PA or NP and non-operative sports medicine physicians in consultation with orthopaedic surgeons during standard office times and after hours.",

The Governor of Maine declared a stop to all non-urgent elective surgery and outpatient appointments three days later on March 15. This was put into place to free inpatient beds and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), making the supplies available for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. We held an organizational meeting March 20, 2020 to initiate the OWICs; the clinics opened three days later on March 23, 2020. Prior to March 23, 2020, patients who presented to the ED with orthopaedic complaints either had emergency inpatient consultation performed by the on-call orthopaedic surgeon or were treated by the ED staff and discharged home with an outpatient non-emergency orthopaedic referral. A mandate was ordered by the state government on March 31, 2020, prohibiting all nonessential travel outside of the home. With the goal of seeing patients that might otherwise have visited the ED for their orthopaedic care, and coinciding with the outpatient interim COVID-19 guidelines, 12 the OWIC patient inclusion criteria included patients with less than one month's history of new onset of musculoskeletal pain, infection, fall or injury, fracture, dislocation, or effusion. Exclusion criteria included patients both with injuries that were too severe for our clinic as well as those that were chronic. Patients with severe injuries sent directly to the ED included polytrauma, open fractures (except for Gustilo-Anderson Grade I open fractures of the upper extremity), and patients transported by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).

These data showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of referrals, although our study did not show direct evidence that the patients who presented to the OWIC were patients who would have otherwise presented to the ED. The ban on non-essential travel outside the home may have contributed to lower orthopaedic presentations to the ED, and this may be a confounding factor in our study.",

Given Maine's relatively low number of cases of coronavirus, this model may not be generalizable to hospitals in larger cities that have been more affected by COVID-19. However, the threat of overburdened healthcare systems and lack of medical resources are universal, and the OWICs demonstrated how EDs can allocate the supply of PPE and other scarce medical equipment for COVID-19 cases. Third, although the orthopaedic clinics developed at our hospital could potentially serve as models for other hospitals across specialties and regions, they are not the only systems to set up specialized emergency clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic; temporary surge clinics have been built across communities in response to the crisis.8,13 Fourth, these clinics are associated with the need for additional resources that might not be available to other facilities.",
