            "text": "Unlike the traditional live-attenuated or inactivated/killed virus vaccines that needs a cultivation of infectious virions, the recombinant protein-based, non-replicating subunit vaccines do not involve in an infectious agent in their production processes and therefore, are considered to be safer than the traditional vaccines. In fact, many viruses, such as human noroviruses (huNoVs), cannot be cultivated efficiently to date,1 making vaccine development against huNoVs difficult and therefore, subunit vaccines the only choice. In other cases, highly virulent viruses, such as poliovirus and variola virus, are risky to cultivate in large scale, making the subunit vaccine approach a safer choice. Other scenarios, in which the subunit vaccine approach is helpful, include the development of vaccines against malaria caused by a large protozoan parasite and other non-infectious diseases caused by certain protein factors of humans, such as hypertension and cancer. In these circumstances, a self-assembled, polyvalent, and highly immunogenic viral particles or protein polymers are used as a platform to increase the immunogenicity of the specific antigens of pathogens or the protein factors that cause the diseases. These chimeric vaccines are combination subunit vaccines that can be designed and used as mono-, bi-, or even trivalent vaccines against one or more pathogens and/or diseases. Development and productions of subunit and combination subunit vaccines through a well-established expression system, including recombinant bacteria, yeast, baculovirus in insect cells, and/or various viral or plasmid vectors in mammalian, avian, or plant cells, are considered to be more cost-effective compared with those of traditional live-attenuated or inactivated/killed virus vaccines. Thus, the subunit vaccine approach would help to extend vaccine distribution more widely to developing countries and remote areas, where the vaccines are usually highly demanded.",

The basic driving force behind these self-assembled capsids is homotypic interactions of the viral capsid proteins. In many cases, heterotypic interactions are also required to assemble more complex capsids that are composed of more than one viral structural proteins. These unique features of viral structural proteins have been utilized to generate various virus-like particles (VLPs), small subviral particles, and/or protein polymers in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2) through one of the well-established recombinant protein expression systems. To date, at least 30 different VLPs, small subviral particles and/or polymers representing more than 20 viral families have been generated (for reviews see Refs. 2-4).\n\n\n",

For example, expression of the major huNoV capsid protein (VP1) via recombinant baculoviruses in inset cells formed huNoV VLPs.5 Most of currently generated VLPs are made by a single capsid protein (for a review see2-4). However, in some cases, more than one capsid proteins are required to assemble more complex VLPs. For instance, double-layered VLPs of rotavirus (RV) can be made by co-expression of VP2 and VP6 proteins using the baculovirus expression system,6 while triple-layered RV VLPs can be generated through constitutive co-expression of VP2, VP6, and VP7 in stably transfected high-5 insect cell lines.7 The most complex recombinant VLPs are the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) VLPs that were made by co-expression of 4 structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, simultaneously using the baculovirus system.8 These data suggest that VLPs of other viruses may also be generated based on the same self-assembly principle and appropriate expression approaches.",

These include 1) lineage polymers through fusion of 2 dimeric proteins together;14 2) network polymers via fusion of 3 dimeric proteins covalently;14 and 3) agglomerate polymers through fusion of an oligomeric protein with a dimeric protein (Fig. 2).15 The driving forces behind these protein polymer formation are the intermolecular dimerization and/or oligomerization among the homologous proteins. These different VLPs, small subviral particles, and protein polymers have been further studied as vaccine candidates (see below).",

So far several VLP-based vaccines have been commercially available for human use globally. These include 2 human papillomavirus (HPV) VLP vaccines consisting of L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV16,17 for prevention of cervical and anogenital infection and diseases associated with HPVs (Gardasil1, Merck & Co., New Jersey, USA; Cervarix1, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK)17-20 and 2 hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) VLP vaccines that are composed of the small surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) against HBV infection (Recombivax HB1, Merck & Co., New Jersey, USA; Engerix-B1, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK).21,22 In addition, a small subviral particle vaccine that is formed by truncated P1 and P2 domains of the HEV capsid protein has recently been developed as an HEV vaccine for humans in China (HEV 239/Hecolin1, Xiamen Innovax Biotech, Xiamen, China).23 These successful VLP and small subviral particle vaccines have endowed the feasibility and usefulness of the subunit vaccine approach. In addition to these 5 subunit vaccines that have been approved for commercial use, many others are under development, among which some, such as huNoV VLP vaccine24 and parvovirus VLP vaccine,25,26 have reached the stage of clinical trials.",

This issue can be solved by fusing these antigens or epitopes onto a large, polyvalent, and highly immunogenic VLP, small subviral particle, or protein polymer platform for improved immunogenicity as combination vaccines. While successful combination vaccines have been reported, challenges have also been encountered. Generally, while larger antigens contain more authentic antigenic features and are more immunogenic, they are less compatible with viral particle-based platforms compared with smaller epitopes that are easier to be incorporated onto the viral particles without compromising the stability of resulting chimeric vaccines. Therefore, a balance between the 2 factors need to be considered for the best vaccine outcomes.",

On the other hand, the protein polymers themselves are made by different antigens (Fig. 2) and thus exhibit a much larger capacity and flexibility to incorporate larger antigens, however, the resulted polymer sizes may be dispersed, which may need better quality control for unified vaccine outcomes.
