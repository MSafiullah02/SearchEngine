In contrast with Kuhn's direction, with philosophers today, including myself, the path of discovery of generalizations about the rationality of science often goes from general epistemological considerations-such as the worthiness of betting in line with the axioms of probability-down, by deduction, to slightly more specific principles intended to explain scientists' behavior, such as that surprising evidence has more confirming power. Such principles are tested against cases antecedently regarded as sound or unsound, but the fact that some of those cases are from the past is not, per se, significant.",

            "text": "However there is another prominent pattern among philosophers of taking the history of science as relevant to its rationality that appears to flow in Kuhn's direction from historical facts to generalizations. For example, in some arguments for scientific realism-the view that we have reason to believe successful theories (or their essential structures) are 'true-ish', rather than just good predictors of observables-putative facts about the history of science are taken as premises. The predictive success, retention, and convergence of opinion over historical time of some theories has been taken to be a reason to think those theories are true-ish. Another case of this pattern, the one that will concern me here, is found in the pessimistic induction (PI), which has nagged at the consciences of philosophers, laypersons, and even some scientists since the 1980s. The premise of this argument is also the putative track record of science, but here it is the failures: a high proportion of past scientists' theories were successful, but by our lights false in what they said about unobservable entities, as in the cases of phlogiston and the luminiferous ether, goes the argument. Induction, broadly construed, is the method of science, and that invites an induction over this sad record to the conclusion that it is not rational to have much confidence that our current successful theories accurately represent the world we cannot see. The history of science thus presents a challenge to the rationality of endorsing our scientists' hypotheses about unobservables at what one might call face value.",

That there were a few such cases or a small proportion of the total cases would give us at most a conclusion that our theories have some chance of being false, and we already knew that. To make the historical claim strong enough for trouble, it would have to be that success with observables is not even a mark of truth. This would require knowing the proportion of false theories in the pools of the successful and unsuccessful theories, but it has been argued that we cannot know these two base rates without begging the question.

Those rates go to secure the premises of the pessimist's argument, which are general facts about history, such as that many successful theories have been false, or that our predecessors have often failed to conceive of conceivable hypotheses. The last step of the pessimist's argument, the \"action\" one might say, begins with the generalizations, not the particular cases that they are generalizations about. Thus though the pessimist does proceed from claims about history, the specifics of the failures he points to-the sort of thing historians have eyes for-quickly become apparently irrelevant to the argument.",

I will use this to argue that even if we could establish damning generalizations about our predecessors, it would not be sufficient for the pessimist's argument to touch the confidences in our own theories that we have arrived at by the usual means of the particular science. On the basis of general points about induction I will argue that novelty and discontinuity over time, particularly a novelty of method that tends to go unappreciated, saves our science from the PI. Ironically, the relevance of novelty is that it renders most failures of the past irrelevant to the rationality of embracing our own theories. The novelty that has the potential for this effect on the pessimist's argument is revealed at every more specific level of description of the past and present cases.",

DNA, and the convection currents and composition of the Sun. 2 This is what is at stake in the argument. Scientists have evidence and arguments for such hypotheses, apportioning their confidences in these hypotheses to what they judge to be the strength of their evidence for them, and the pessimist's argument must show why those things the good scientist already does are not sufficient to justify their confidences in particular hypotheses if he is going to show anything troubling.",

That the PI is reflective does not excuse scientists from addressing it, of course. Scientists reflect on their procedures and arguments every day, but how reflective they are obligated to be is limited by the quality of the meta-level objections. So, the pessimist has the burden to give an argument of good quality that is distinct from those scientists already address, if we are to have a special problem that derives from the historical record.

The argument I will make is not restricted to next-case induction or generalization, but applies equally well to, for example, inference to causes. My argument, which rests on a claim that relevance demands similarity, does not hold generally for inference to the best explanation, or abduction, but this is not a form of argument the pessimist is using, or I think can use. 4 Given all of this, I will use the term \"induction\" for the forms of ampliative inference for which my assumptions hold, in the hopes that any kind of ampliative inference for which my claim about similarity and relevance does not hold is also, like abduction, one there is no way for the pessimistic inductivist to exploit.",

In the swan case there is such a property because the habitats of the swans you have seen may easily be different from the habitats of some swans you are projecting to, and there is often color variation within species in different habitats. Such a property P provides what Hans Reichenbach called a \"cross-induction\". 6 For an induction to be justified, the similarity base must not be undermined by available evidence of a further property of the subjects (here distinct habitats) that is plausibly relevant to the presence or absence of the projected property (here white color). 7 Often, cross-inductions operate under the surface. A smart-aleck could point out that swans and paper towels do have a similarity base; they both occur in the United States, for example. What is wrong with an induction based on that similarity is that there are further properties of swans and paper towels that are plausibly relevant to color, such as that one is an animal and the other a cleaning item. Another way to think of the situations where cross-inductions are appropriate, and one that will be helpful here, is that under-description of the evidence and the target has concealed the irrelevance of the evidence to the conclusion. Sometimes, we know and apply a fuller description automatically and unconsciously, as with the paper towels; sometimes we discover the further properties for cross-induction in the course of time, as with Europeans discovering black swans in Australia; and sometimes we already know of the further properties but have failed to take them into account. The latter is the case with the PI.",

But then our theories are seen as false because of particular counter-evidence to them, perhaps discovered by doing history, and not because of an induction over the history of science. Thus, this object-level content strategy does not succeed. The argument reduces to something that either is not an induction or is not pessimistic. If these points are obvious, that is good for my argument. I have excavated them in order to show that the pessimist has no options at the object level.

We all, after all, used the Scientific Method. 9 Even though we avoid the language of scientific method, the rationalityphilosopher's search for the most general rules of inductive reasoning does implicitly keep a focus on one method, in aiming for the minimum number of principles from which we could derive all of the various more particular rules we see as being followed.

This is not an option for those of us who think there is, in the sense of basic forms of inductive inference and the demand for probabilistic coherence, and even some more sophisticated principles of evidence management. However, even granting the existence of shared method, or rules, or generalizations about sanctioned belief behavior, it is a mistake to think that that is enough to make the pessimistic induction work here. This is because cross-inductions are available. A cross-induction does not require that the two populations be different in every way, but only in some way plausibly relevant to the projected property. And there are many more specific things to say about methods that are relevant to the effectiveness of our belief-forming practices at giving us true theories, that is, to our reliability. Those specific things are different for different contexts and questions, and even for the same subject matter, methods are different between our predecessors and ourselves. There is a lot more method than general philosophers of science tend to think about. Any procedure, tool, experimental design, protocol, instrument, is a method, because it has generality. It is repeated, held the same over cases of probing the world, and something has to be because we need sufficient sample sizes of evidence produced and evaluated in the same way to do legitimate positive inductions about particular matters. And though there is a great deal of retention of method at the general level, even there there are always new statistical methods, procedures, distinctions, and tools that are added to the methods we retain from past science. Statistics is itself a science, and it expands over time. 11 Thus, we will escape the PI on those particular occasions when cross-inductions on method are available, and they very often are when we compare ourselves to much of the history of science. Under-description of scientific method 9 We tend to be reluctant to extend this compliment to science before the modern era, but I think a pessimist believes there is enough failure to get true theories in the modern era to allow the pessimistic argument to proceed. Note that it is not necessary that one associate the similarity of justifiedness the pessimist attributes to us and our predecessors with scientific method, in order for my cross-induction below to succeed against it. 10 One might think the similarity between our predecessors and ourselves is that we all have inferred truth from empirical success. However, that is a method because it is a rule that we use to justify a move from results to conclusions. It is also an exceedingly general method, and more particular things there always are to say about methods can cross this method too in the way discussed below. For example, there are ever more and different ways of evaluating empirical success. 11 See Glymour 2004 for some examples of this. conceals irrelevance of the premise (here data about past scientists' justifiedness and failures) to the conclusion (here the claim that we are unreliable).",

In this actual case, it was the same experiment to a significant degree, so there is a similarity base.

There is a fact of the matter, and often evidence about, whether a difference is relevant to reliability on question q, and many are not. For example, often the experimenter wears a different shirt when he runs the same experiment on a different day, but typically we do not think that will affect the results. If so, then yesterday's failure is not irrelevant just because of the different shirt. The fact that you use your method today or tomorrow usually is not relevant, although it will be if you are studying astronomical events like eclipses. You may have good reason to believe that whether you do it in Chicago or New York will not, per se, be relevant to the outcome, in which case you cannot ignore a failure the same experiment had in the other location just because it was a different location. Generally, which earrings I wear will not matter, but if they are made of heavy metal they might interfere with a magnet, so taking them off could make a difference, and if they are big and bright enough they might be distracting in a cognitive experiment with babies.

So, the scientist addresses the PI over the history of science in doing the science itself.

What right have we or they to think that? Moreover, why is my demand that the pessimist engage the scientist at the object level not gratuitously ignoring the issue? I do not need to know whether the difference between chlorine and gallium and that between a neutrino detector and a microscope are relevant to reliability in detecting neutrinos, nor do the scientists' arguments about these matters need to be successful in order for my deflection of the PI to succeed. My point has been that these are the kinds of questions the pessimist's argument depends on and to which he needs negative answers if he is to succeed. They are questions about which particular differences of method are relevant to reliability of particular conclusions. They are particular because the scientist needs only one relevant difference of method in order to have a cross-induction against the relevance of a past failure. Every particular feature of a method in a particular case of our science is thus a potential threat to the pessimistic induction. All such features taken together exhaust the potential doubt a PI over the past could muster. It happens that every day scientists address, or are ready to address, particular claims about what methodical differences are relevant to the reliability of their particular results. Since every such feature is a threat to the pessimist's argument, his argument can only succeed if he takes the fight to the scientists themselves, and argues, for example, that the neutrino detector is not different from a microscope in a way that is plausibly relevant to reliability at detecting neutrinos.

The main, and familiar, problem about rationality is that if everything changes at once then there is nothing unchanged through a paradigm shift that could be a neutral arbiter between the before-and after-theories, to tell us why the change is rational or justified. The arbiter used to be observations, but these are theory-laden; what you see depends on which theory you already subscribe to. I will call this the neutral-arbiter problem.

So, layers typically change at different times according to their own needs and objectives, which are not always that of testing high theories.

However, Galison's argument rescues the epistemic strength of science by finding continuity over time despite the temporal discontinuities. In the rope metaphor that he uses, the existence of quasi-independent strands is crucial to a rope's strength because when one strand is strained, the others are not breaking. I am addressing a different problem, which is a dual of the neutral arbiter problem because in the PI it is the continuity and similarity of method over time that appeared to create a problem. And the rationality of typical science is assured against this problem, I think, not despite differences over time but because of them. Earlier I pointed out that identical method in every instance of science would produce the most powerful possible pessimistic induction. The dual of that here is that a radical paradigm shift in which everything, even the more specific layers, really did change at once would be the ultimate weapon against the PI. It would prevent any induction from previous science to our own, whether negative or positive, because if everything were different there would be no similarity base at all. Of course, if we claimed a paradigm shift in that radical sense then an answer to the PI would come at the expense of an answer to the neutral arbiter problem.",

It only needs to be different in some way that we have reason to believe is relevant to reliability.

We know that our predecessors were subject to this because we have since conceived relevant alternatives they did not. There is no reason to think we are different in this, so we can expect our successors to conceive of alternative explanations for our evidence that we have not.

And even supposing that there remain an infinite number of alternatives there can be a clear probabilistic sense in which the proportion remaining has been decreased.

That there is something right comes from the fact that induction is not deduction. Just as inductive support comes in degrees, so does every cross-induction come with a degree. There is a degree to which you are justified in believing the crossinduction property is present, and a degree to which you are justified in believing it is relevant to your reliability on q, those two combining for a cross of a certain 14 Thanks to Bill Talbott for this argument. Note once again the dependence of its premise on a high base rate of falsehood of past successful theories. 15 Thanks to Catherine Z. Elgin for the very helpful objection addressed in this section. There is another apparent way of arguing that a history of past failures has got to make a difference that our particular judgments do not already pick up on, which is imagining the same current situation of evidence and theories but preceded in one case by a history of failures and in the other case by a history of successes. Surely that makes a difference to the confidence we are entitled to have in our theories (Thanks to Shelly Kagan for this objection.). The problem with this argument is its premise. If our theories have all successes, then there cannot have ever been evidence inconsistent with our theories, since it would be part of our evidence pool. So if the same amount of evidence was collected in the two pasts then there is much more positive or neutral evidence for our theories than there would be with a history of past failures. That means that it is not possible to have the same current theory-evidence situation with the two different histories. degree. Some relevance of the past to the present remains because there are still similarities between our predecessors and ourselves. The fact that we are all human beings doing the scientific method in the most abstract sense is the scaffolding for the thousands of more particular features of our methods, so its relevance is not zero. Thus, something of the general PI remains, which raises the question how strong it is. It is easy to see from what I have argued above that the degree of legitimate PIs and crossings by novelty of method will co-vary with the degree of similarity and dissimilarity of method. I will now argue that both of these co-vary with logical strength of hypotheses. This means that to be sensitive to the logical strength of hypotheses is already to be sensitive to the degree to which pessimistic inductions work.",

At least it is rarely appreciated that this is a good thing. 16 To illustrate, consider the example of the Standard Model of particle physics combined with auxiliary assumptions in comparison to a particular claim that follows from them, such as the existence of the Higgs boson. On the basis of successful experiments, physicists may be, and some are, quite confident though not certain that the Higgs boson exists, while also being confident that the Standard Model is false. The rationality of this can be seen if we represent the rational confidence of a subject as a probability. Then we would formulate the claim that the subject's degree of belief in q is x as P(q) = x, the probability of q is x. If so, then the fact that a scientists' degree of belief, x, is 99 % instead of 100 %-confident but not certainmakes a very big difference to what probability rationally requires when a single claim like the existence of the Higgs boson is conjoined with many others.",

It also requires that one be certain of its conjunction with other claims one is certain of. In contrast, if one has even a sliver of a doubt about individual claims, and those claims are independent, then one's confidence in the conjunction must be exponentially lower than that in any of the individual claims. If there are 16, let us say independent, claims of existence of elementary particles, then even if the scientists are extremely confident about each, say 99 %, rationality requires them to have a 15 % confidence that at least one of them is wrong. This doubt in the conjunction grows with the number of conjuncts: with 40 independent claims, the required degree of doubt in the conjunction is 27 %. The degree of required doubt increases even faster the lower the confidence in the original individual hypotheses. If one is 95 % confident in each of the 16 claims about the particles-only 4 % lower than just supposed-then one will be required to be more confident than not that at least one of them is wrong: 57 %.

However, that will have no empirical consequences for this world, the actual world, without adding a lot of auxiliary assumptions about this world. For example, Newton's theory of mechanics can be compactly expressed as three laws, but one must specify where the massive objects actually are at a given time, how massive they are, and so on, in order to figure out what this theory says about where they are going to be at a different time. If seen as a proposition, then a universal, substantive theory is a huge conjunction, and with the number of claims increasing at this level, the required confidence that the conjunction is wrong increases dramatically. If we have a million claims, then even if we have 95 % confidence in each we are required to be more sure that at least one of them is false than we are sure of any individual one of them. In our example, if we are 95 % confident that the Higgs boson exists, then to remain rational we must be 96 % confident that the Standard Model is false. From the other side, even if we are 96 % confident that the Standard Model is false, very high confidence in the existence of the Higgs boson does not make us irrational.",

This is merely confidence that at least one of the million claims is false. What we see in the historical record is cases where a big part of the big idea was wrong in a big way. Should logic alone make us confident of the same about our own theories, and if so, then would that not amount to winning the battle but losing the war against the pessimist? One might mean several different things by \"big\", but we can address the objection by measuring size of error as how many or what fraction of one's claims were wrong. 17 This would capture, for example, the idea that a big claim has many implications. Consider a theory with 1 million independent claims as earlier, and suppose that we are 85 % sure of each of them. Then we will be obligated to be 97 % confident that the theory is false somewhere. But also, at this 85 % level it only takes five claims to be required to be 56 % sure that one of them is false. 18 That, as like as not, one of every five of my claims is false is a substantial admission: one fifth of 1 million is two hundred thousand. Yet this does not prevent the rationality of my 85 % confidence in each one of the 1 million claims. This is as it should be because the big admission that two hundred thousand of my claims are more likely than not to be false, and the reference to the \"big\" mistakes of history, give us no hint of which of my claims are at fault. Recall that it is scientists' right to go on with their practice of making this or that particular claim in keeping with their usual evidence and arguments that 17 Is the structure of a theory the big part, or is it the types of entities the theory takes to exist that are big? Is the hypothesis that the ether exists big because the ether was supposed to cover the entire universe and affect every motion? Or was it small because it was a single proposition that, as it turned out, is independent of much of the rest of the theory it was housed in? Answering these questions would do much to carve out one's brand of realism or anti-realism, which is not my purpose here. 18 If my confidence in each is 0.75 then I must be 0.76 confident that one of every five claims I made is false. I am concerned to defend, and our example of a big admission does not impose a confidence drop below 85 % on any particular claim. A general theory is equivalent to a huge conjunction, so we should be well aware without looking at our predecessors that it is very likely to be false, and it is clear on reflection that that does not impose a low confidence for any particular claim.",

Consider the 16 particles of the Standard Model. Verifying all of those particles supports the theory to some degree, and the whole set of these verifications gives stronger support to the theory than any subset of them would. However, these particles were verified using a very wide array of types of methods, i.e., particle detectors. The bubble chamber is different from the spark chamber, and neither is much like the Large Hadron Collider. To defend the Standard Model against a PI, we should appeal to differences between the method we used to test it and those our predecessors used on their theories. But if we were to state the method by which this theory was tested or supported, it would have to be a quite generic saying because it would have to be true of all of those methods that went into the verification, and relatively little is. There will be some statistical methods that all of our particle experimenters have used and their predecessors did not have, but what is common in the verifications of the particles does not go a great deal beyond that. By contrast, someone who used the bubble chamber to detect kaon decay would have a great deal to say about how his method was relevantly different from those of his predecessors who tried to detect the unseen. We necessarily have less material for a cross-induction on method on behalf of a theory than we will on behalf of particular, logically weaker, claims that follow from the theory. Logically weaker claims are not only easier to support by evidence (other things equal), but also more resistant to the PI. Notice once again that the distinction between observable and unobservable made no difference to the arguments of this section. Even supposing it exists, the Higgs boson is unobservable.",
