            "text": "One of the major differences between the two expression systems is the manner in which the gene of interest (GOI) is delivered to the production host. Construction of the recombinant baculovirus begins with the cloning of the GOI into a transfer vector that allows recombination-mediated transfer of the GOI into the baculovirus genome while it is maintained as an episomal DNA element (bacmid) in Escherichia coli\n[12], [13]. After recovery of the recombinant bacmid DNA from E. coli, it is transfected into insect cells, resulting in a productive viral infection. The baculovirus stock is then used for the large-scale infection of insect cells to produce the recombinant protein of interest. Unfortunately, the baculovirus infection of insect cells is cytolytic, limiting the production phase to a relatively short period of 2\u20135 days. In contrast, TGE requires the cloning of the GOI into a mammalian expression vector. After amplification of the plasmid in E. coli, it can to be transfected into cells. A protein production phase of up to 2 weeks is possible depending on the protein and the culture conditions. In optimized cultures, volumetric yields up to 1 g/L have been reached [14]. A major drawback of this method, however, is the amount of plasmid DNA, typically 1 mg or more, required per liter of transfection. By comparison, the generation of the recombinant baculovirus vector is time-consuming, but its continued propagation is relatively simple and inexpensive.",

However, there is a major difference between the two animal cell hosts with regard to N-linked glycosylation. Insect cells mainly synthesize oligomannosidic and paucimannosidic glycans with low levels of galactose and sialic acid [13], [15]. In contrast, mammalian cells synthesize complex glycans containing mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid [16], [17]. For applications in structural biology, it is often beneficial to produce glycoproteins with homogenous oligomannosidic glycans that can be efficiently removed by glycosidases [18], [19], [20]. For therapeutic proteins, on the other hand, it is preferable to have complex glycans to enhance both the half-life and functionality of the protein in vivo\n[21], [22], [23].",

A non-exhaustive list of examples of proteins which have been produced in these cells is provided in Table 1\n. Since 2004, over 20 structures have been resolved using proteins produced transiently in HEK-293 cells. In addition, the method has been successfully applied to the production of virus vectors for the purpose of gene delivery (Table 1). Despite these successes, there may be perceptions that TGE is unaffordable for many academic labs and that the cultivation of mammalian cells in suspension is technically difficult. Fortunately, the production yields from transiently transfected mammalian cells have improved considerably in the last decade, and innovative cost-effective, non-instrumented cultivation systems for suspension-adapted mammalian cells have been developed [24], [25], [26]. These technical improvements have dramatically reduced protein production costs.",

The cells were initially used to propagate adenovirus mutants deficient in these genes. Due to their ease of cultivation and transfection, they eventually gained popularity as a TGE host. Subsequently, HEK-293T (American Type Culture Collection) and HEK-293E cells, resulting from stable transfection of the parental line with the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LT) gene and the Epstein\u2013Barr Virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) gene, respectively, were generated [35], [36]. Both EBNA1 and SV40 LT function in viral DNA synthesis by binding to the cognate viral origin of DNA replication (ori) to recruit the cellular DNA replication machinery. These two cell lines were developed with the expectation that they would support the episomal replication and maintenance of a transfected plasmid DNA bearing the appropriate viral ori [37]. For the TGE system described here, HEK-293E cells were used. Interestingly, the highest protein yields in these cells were achieved under conditions of growth arrest following transfection with plasmids that did not bear the EBV ori [14]. However, there may be other TGE conditions in which episomal replication of the plasmid has a positive effect on recombinant protein yield [38], [39], [40].",

To select among these options, one must take into account the cost and engineering parameters of the equipment. Spinner flasks are inexpensive and available in nominal volumes of 100 mL\u201336 L. However, due to poor mixing and gas transfer, they do not adequately support high-density cell cultivation in the absence of active aeration. The WAVE bioreactor relies on disposable bags with nominal volumes of 500 mL\u2013500 L [63], [64], [65], [66]. The single-use bags are a major operating expense, and cultures in WAVE bags require active aeration for optimal cell growth. The other shortcoming of the WAVE bioreactor is that the simultaneous operation of multiple cultures requires multiple agitation/heating units, increasing the space and equipment needs. Finally, STRs are difficult to maintain, set-up and operate. They are also impractical for the performance of simultaneous cultures and for small-scale operations. Their cost may also be prohibitive for many potential users.",

Orbitally shaken containers include the disposable TubeSpin\u00ae bioreactor 50 and 600 tubes (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) with nominal volumes of 50 and 600 mL, respectively, cylindrical glass bottles with nominal volumes of 100 mL\u20135 L, square-shaped glass bottles with nominal volumes of 100 mL\u20131 L, and shake flasks with nominal volumes of 250 mL\u20135 L. We perform most of our operations in TubeSpin\u00ae bioreactors and in glass bottles [24], [26], [68]. Small-scale operations at volumes of 2\u201310 mL and medium-scale operations of 100\u2013500 mL are well-suited to the TubeSpin\u00ae bioreactor 50 and TubeSpin\u00ae bioreactor 600, respectively (Fig. 1\n) [24], [71]. These disposable containers are shaped like conical centrifuge tubes, but they are equipped with a ventilated cap having a membrane filter as a sterility barrier. Cultures in these tubes are maintained in an incubator shaker with 5% CO2 and 85% humidity in racks attached to the shaker platform (Fig. 1). It is important that the tubes fit tightly in the rack to prevent their rotation during agitation. The tubes double as centrifuge tubes to facilitate cell handling. Alternatively, it is possible to perform small-scale transfections in multi-well plates, but this cultivation system is limited by high evaporation rates [72], [73].",

Importantly, efficient mixing can be achieved with a low power input, resulting in less shear stress on cells, by an order of magnitude, than observed in STRs [25], [70], [75], [76], [77].",

We have found that the minimal expression vector can be constructed with the hCMV mIE promoter/enhancer, a polyadenlyation site, and either a splice site in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) or the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) in the 3\u2032 UTR [14]. Currently, we use an expression vector (pXLGHEK) that has the bovine growth hormone polyadenlyation site and a chimeric \u00df-globin-IgG splice site [14], [79].",

Among the scalable methods, the least expensive reagents are calcium phosphate (CaPi) and cationic polymers [11]. The former, however, requires the presence of serum in the transfection medium [84]. Since serum-free conditions are often preferred for the production phase, it is necessary to perform a medium exchange following gene delivery with CaPi [85]. Moreover, the formation of the CaPi-DNA complex is time-dependent, increasing the technical difficulty of its use at large scale. PEI-mediated gene delivery, on the other hand, does not require serum in the medium [86], and time-dependent pre-complex formation between PEI and DNA is not required [29], [87]. Cationic liposomes are arguably the most efficient DNA delivery vehicles [2], but their high cost is a limitation for their use at large scale [10], [11].",

Dissolving PEI requires acidification of the solution to pH 3 by addition of 1 N HCl. When all the PEI is in solution, the pH is increased to 7.0 by addition of 1 N NaOH. The solution is filter sterilized and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Linear 25 kDa PEI in this form usually has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 6\u20137 kg/mol with the range being 2\u201326 kg/mol [88]. Its polydispersity index (PDI) is about 1.9, an important property for efficient DNA delivery in HEK-293E cells [88]. In the synthesis of PEI from 2-ethyloxazoline, there is an acidification step to remove N-propionyl groups from the amine. However, this reaction may not be complete, resulting in batch-to-batch variation in the percentage of protonatable amine groups [88]. The presence of N-propionyl groups reduces both the charge density of PEI and the strength of its interaction with DNA. Nevertheless, we observed that the transfection efficiency of various batches of PEI with 4\u201315% N-propionyl groups did not vary [88].",

This culture is started at a density of 1.5\u20132.5 \u00d7 106\n cells/mL. The next day the appropriate volume of culture is centrifuged, and the cell pellet is resuspended at a density of 5 \u00d7 106\n cells/mL in ProCHO5\u2122 medium pre-warmed to 31 \u00b0C. DNA and PEI are added sequentially at 0.6 \u03bcg/million cells and 3.0 \u03bcg/million cells, respectively. After each addition the culture is mixed by swirling. For a 1-L (final volume) transfection, 5 \u00d7 109\n cells are resuspended in 1 L of medium in a 5-L cylindrical glass bottle (Fig. 3). Immediately, 3 mg of DNA and 15 mg of PEI (1 mg/mL stock solution) are added sequentially with brief mixing after each addition [89]. The culture is then transferred to an incubator shaker at 31 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and agitated at 120 rpm with the bottle cap slightly open [79], [89], [95]. Under these conditions, the cells go through one doubling by day 1 post-transfection and then stop dividing [79], [89]. The cells can be maintained at 31 \u00b0C for up to 10 days before the cell viability falls below 50% [79], [89], [95]. We have not experienced problems with the affinity purification of secreted proteins in ProCHO5\u2122 medium, and so this medium can be used for all steps of the TGE process. With CHO-DG44 cells the transfection efficiency, as determined by co-transfection with an eGFP expression vector as described for HEK-293E cells, is usually 50\u201360%. The maximum accumulation of transmembrane and intracellular proteins is usually observed at 2\u20134 days post-transfection, while for secreted proteins the maximum level can be observed at 4\u201310 days post-transfection.",

We did not observe a limitation to plasmid DNA uptake in either host. Instead, the steady-state level of transgene mRNA, as measured by quantitative PCR, did reach a plateau as the amount of plasmid DNA uptake increased [93]. A transcriptional limitation for transiently transfected HEK-293E has been independently reported [97]. For both CHO-DG44 and HEK-293E cells, most of the intracellular plasmid DNA remains intact, at least up to day 3 post-transfection [93]. However, the majority of this DNA is present as linear or nicked circular DNA rather than supercoiled DNA, as judged by southern blot analysis of total cellular DNA [93]. Unfortunately, it is not known if all three forms of plasmid DNA are competent for transcription in mammalian cells. From these results, it appears that further improvements in TGE yields will need to overcome the limitation in transgene transcription.",
