This case definition will be updated periodically as new information becomes available. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing. As of April 2, 2003, a total of 2,223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases have been reported to the WHO from 16 countries, including the United States.3, 4 The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 3.5%).
