            "text": "Calnexin (IP90/P88) is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that binds to monoglycosylated oligosaccharides. It was first identified as a protein that associates with partly folded MHC class I molecules, T-cell receptors and membrane immunoglobulins (Degen and Williams, 1991, Ahluwalia et al., 1992, Hochstenbach et al., 1992). Together with calreticulin, its soluble homologue, it participates in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle responsible for folding and quality control of newly-synthesized glycoproteins before their export from the ER (Ou et al., 1993, Hammond et al., 1994, Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003). Calnexin has also been shown to play a role in ER calcium regulation (Wada et al., 1991, Roderick et al., 2000), phagocytosis (M\u00fcller-Taubenberger et al., 2001) and cell sensitivity to apoptosis (Gu\u00e9rin et al., 2008, Takizawa et al., 2004, Zuppini et al., 2002, Delom et al., 2007). Two distinct luminal domains of calnexin were revealed by crystallization (Schrag et al., 2001): the globular domain that contains the lectin binding site and an extended arm domain, containing two tandem proline rich motifs, which binds to ERp57 (Leach et al., 2002). The C-terminal domain is highly acidic with a protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation site that plays a possible role regulating the chaperone function (Ou et al., 1992, Chevet et al., 1999). One well investigated function of calnexin is stabilizing both major histocompatibility MHC class I and class II molecules (Anderson and Cresswell, 1994, Carreno et al., 1995). In humans, newly translated MHC class I heavy chain associates with calnexin rapidly, but it is released and replaced by calreticulin upon assembly of heavy chain with beta2 microglobulin. However, in murine cells either calnexin or calreticulin may associate with beta2 microglobulin-heavy chain dimers. Interestingly, experiments assessing the function of calnexin in the biogenesis of class I molecules showed contradicting results. Co-expression of calnexin or calreticulin with MHC class I heavy chain in Drosophila melanogaster cells demonstrated fivefold enhanced assembly with the beta2 microglobulin, while treatment with ER glucosidase I and II, inhibitors of monoglycosylated oligosaccharide formation, reduced the assembly and surface expression of MHC class I (Vassilakos et al., 1996). However, other experiments using calnexin human deficient cell lines showed no effect at all on class I assembly, transport or peptide loading (Sadasivan et al., 1995, Scott and Dawson, 1995). These experimental discrepancies may be either explained by the different model systems used or by the redundancy of molecular chaperones that can functionally replace calnexin in the ER such as calreticulin (Zhang and Williams, 2006).",

            "text": "Co-immunoprecipitation studies have also demonstrated that calnexin can function as chaperone for some viral glycoproteins such as the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and more recently the S glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus by assisting in their folding and full maturation (Hammond and Helenius, 1994, Fukushi et al., 2012). Calnexin homologues have been identified in many eukaryotes such as plants, yeast, Xenopus (Huang et al., 1993, Parlati et al., 1995, Yamamoto and Nakamura, 1996) several fish species [Fuller et al., 2004, Danio rerio\nNM_213448.1, Takifugu rubripes\nXM_003978229 and XM_003978694] and remarkably in Dictyostelium (M\u00fcller-Taubenberger et al., 2001), which implies possible conserved functions for this molecule. To date, calnexin\u2019s role in teleost fish has only been investigated in channel catfish where it was shown to associate both with the non-glycosylated MHC class II alpha chain and the glycosylated beta chain (Fuller et al., 2004). However, no studies have been carried out to assess its role during MHC class I folding, MHC class I receptor assembly in the ER or its possible association with viral glycoproteins mainly due to the lack of available antibodies. In rainbow trout, besides calnexin, most of the genes encoding molecular chaperones involved in this pathway have been fully characterised such as tapasin (Landis et al., 2006), calreticulin (Kales et al., 2004) and recently ERp57 (Sever et al., 2013). In this work two unique cDNA clones for calnexin from trout peripheral blood leukocytes are reported and their regulation under ER stress induced conditions is described.",

The main characteristic of the rainbow trout calnexin proteins are illustrated in Fig. 1\n. The N terminal domain includes a 24 aa signal peptide, followed by a luminal domain which contains a globular domain and an extended arm domain with a central segment, the P domain. This segment contains two proline motifs: M1 and M2 repeated in tandem 4 times each with the consensus sequences of M1: I-DP(D/E)A-KPEDWD(D/E) and M2: G-W-P-IN-P-Y. Moreover, there are 3 regions that have high sequence identity with human calnexin that are named box a, b and c. The box a segment is located upstream to calreticulin domain 1 whereas box b and c flank the repeated motifs. There is also a transmembrane domain of 21 aa that was predicted by TMHMM Server. Interestingly, there are two pairs of cysteines predicted to be palmitoylated by CSS-Palm 3.0 immediately after the transmembrane domain. These cysteines are found to be conserved across many species and when palmitoylated were shown to be critical for the association of calnexin with the ribosome translocon complex, allowing calnexin to bind to the N-linked glycans as they exit from the translocon (Lakkaraju et al., 2012). Another shared feature with mammalian calnexin is the presence of an acidic cytoplasmic tail enriched with glutamic acid and ER retention signal KQEDDL, which appears only in one of the clones and interestingly does not appear in the channel catfish sequence (Fuller et al., 2004). There are 5 phosphorylation sites predicted by NetPhos 2.0 Server for both trout clones, however a unique serine phosphorylation site downstream of the ER retention signal known to regulate calnexin activation (Chevet et al., 2010) appears only in calnexin cDNA sequence containing the ER retention motif.",

As expected, strong distinct clusters can be seen for the tetrapod, teleost fish and plant sequences. Both trout sequences clustered together with a short genetic distance suggesting a recent gene duplication event, which is common in salmonids (Schmidtke and Kandt, 1981). Interestingly a more ancient duplication event also seems to have occurred in teleost fish, as both pufferfish, and rice fish showed a second sequence which grouped with zebrafish calmegin outside the main cluster of fish, frog and mammalian calnexin sequences, but still within a vertebrate cluster. This suggests a very early duplication event to produce this testis-specific ER chaperone homologous to calnexin.",

This lower band is strongly expressed in RTS11 (Fig 4B). The highest expression of that transcript was observed in spleen, head kidney PBLs (Fig 4A) and in the cell line RTS11 (Fig 4B). In order to determine if both bands were similarly regulated, RTS11 cells were treated with A23187, which is known to induce ER stress and upregulate other molecular chaperones in vitro such as ERp57 (Sever et al., 2013). Importantly, the lower calnexin transcript was upregulated up to 2.6-fold in 24 h followed by a decreased expression at 36 h. Interestingly, the upper band expression remained relatively constant (Fig. 4B and C). This result points out to the possibility that trout may have two unique transcripts responding differentially to ER induced stress due to unique modes of regulation.",

This antibody was generated against the recombinant P domain of human calnexin, which shares 81% identity with the trout calnexin sequence. As opposed to its 70 KDa predicted molecular weight, trout calnexin protein was detected as a 120 kDa band in RTS11, RTgill, RTgut, RTovarian fluid and RTliver (Fig. 5\nA and B). Interestingly, a lower fainter band around 100 KDa was also detected in all cell lines tested. A doublet band around 55 kDa was observed in RT liver, probably due to antibody binding to calreticulin, known to migrate as a doublet band in trout (Kales et al., 2007). In channel catfish calnexin is detected as a single band around 100 kDa compared to its 69 kDa molecular weight (Fuller et al., 2004). This discrepancy is common in many species and might be explained by the abundance of acidic amino acids which interferes with SDS binding and reduce the mobility on SDS\u2013PAGE, and post-translational modifications. Importantly, induction of RTS11 with A23187 in a set of three repeats showed detection of the lower band in the treated cells but not in the control (Fig. 6\n). RTS11 treated with poly IC did not show any induction of the lower band (data not shown) which suggests that the expression of the smaller version of calnexin is modified specifically under ER stress conditions.",

Two unique cDNA clones encoding trout calnexin which share 99% sequence identity in their coding region were identified. Intriguingly, only one cDNA version contains a unique c-terminal with putative ER retention signal and conserved serine phosphorylation site which activates calnexin when protein misfolding occurs and is important for the recruitment of calnexin to ribosome translocons (Cameron et al., 2009, Chevet et al., 1999, Lakkaraju et al., 2012). Sequence alignment with the human calnexin protein reveals 72% identity and implies structural and functional conservation of calnexin as an ER lectin chaperone, calcium binding protein and as a protein indirectly assisting in oxidative folding. The luminal domain of calnexin contains the two conserved domains: the globular and the arm domain. The lectin binding site was found in a pocket on the surface of the globular domain (Schrag et al., 2001) whereas the tip of the arm domain contains the docking site that recruits ERp57 (Leach et al., 2002) and therefore helps to support oxidative folding in the ER. The P domain in the central arm segment contains two conserved motifs repeated four times each which contain low capacity and high affinity calcium binding sites, while the c-terminal domain is highly enriched with acidic amino acids shown to be as high capacity low affinity calcium binding sites (Michalak et al., 1992). All of these features are evident in the trout calnexin sequences, suggesting that many of its roles are conserved in trout, however the differences in the C terminal domains between the calnexin cDNA sequences might suggest of unique mode of regulation and perhaps differential subcellular localisation.",

Interestingly, in trout two possible transcript bands for calnexin were observed that are expressed only in immune system organs. Surprisingly, ER stress induction in RTS11 using A23187 showed that the smaller, less abundant transcript band was induced in contrast to the main transcript which remained unchanged. Similar results under the same stimulating conditions were obtained at the protein level showing the induction of a less abundant 100 kDa band with no change in expression of the higher molecular weight protein band. These results support the presence of two trout genes for calnexin that are regulated differently under ER stress conditions and perhaps performing unique biological functions. Importantly, according to their predicted cDNA sequences their difference in size might be more due to post translational modification rather than simply amino acid differences.",

This suggests that fish calnexin may perform functions during ER stress that calreticulin cannot. Under normal conditions, trout calreticulin expression was found to be highest in the liver (Kales et al., 2007) while trout calnexin seems to be more abundant in immune system organs. Interestingly, while calnexin deficient mice display impaired motor function they are not embryonic lethal (Denzel et al., 2002) while calreticulin deficient mice exhibit an embryonic lethal phenotype due to a defect in heart development (Michalak et al., 2002). In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that both genes are important for generation of neuromasts during lateral line development in zebrafish using calnexin and calreticulin knockout morpholinos, however the calnexin knockout had a more profound effect on this development (Hung et al., 2013). These results suggest that both in mammals and in fish calreticulin and calnexin play a role during embryonic development, which suggest these two proteins may have distinctive roles outside of their chaperone function. Monitoring the expression of these two calnexin genes during stages of embryogenesis in rainbow trout could shed a light on their possible unique functions during development.",

            "text": "The immunocytochemistry of calnexin in RTS11 suggests that calnexin is localised to the ER and possibly resides close to the nucleus, as in some cells it showed staining near the nucleus. Interestingly, calnexin has been found as the major calcium binding protein in rat hepatic nuclear membranes although appeared as a minor member of the total nuclear protein (Gilchrist and Pierce, 1993). In addition, immunostaining of calnexin in rat epithelial cells has demonstrated a reticular network structure and nuclear envelope staining (Wada et al., 1991) supporting our findings. It may be that the trout calnexin without the ER retention signal can escape the ER and perhaps be localised in the nuclear periphery where it can regulate calcium levels in this region. However, further experimentation with monoclonal antibodies to each specific form is required to see which form(s) is localised to the nuclear region.",

The first report linking calnexin to apoptosis was conducted in an S. pombe yeast two hybrid system demonstrating that calnexin is required for cell death mediated by the interaction of its cytosolic tail with the a pro-apoptotic protein BAK (Torgler et al., 1997). Later studies in mammals using calnexin-deficient cells further demonstrated its possible role in mediating apoptosis as these cells showed resistance to ER stress induced apoptosis (Zuppini et al., 2002, Groenendyk et al., 2006). Another surprising function for calnexin came from a study with Dictyostelium, the only microorganism containing both calnexin and calreticulin proteins. This study showed that co-disruption of calnexin and calreticulin results in severely impaired phagocytosis and compromised growth of the phagocytic cups (M\u00fcller-Taubenberger et al., 2001), pointing to a possible primary function for calnexin in this organism. This highlights the significance of studying the evolution of this molecule.",
