When people contact these contaminated surfaces and then contact their eyes, mouths, or noses, there could be a potential infection of respiratory diseases. This is referred to as the indirect contact transmission (or fomite transmission). Conjunctiva and nasal mucous membrane can also be a portal of entry for many respiratory pathogens.2 Table I shows some examples. In buildings, infectious particles can be deposited on indoor surface materials and clothing of occupants.",

            "text": "Although understanding has been established on the indirect contact transmission process of respiratory infection, little research has been done to evaluate the relative significance of these factors. Quantitative infection risk assessment provides a scientific way for such evaluation. The classical Wells\u2010Riley equation used for infection risk assessment of respiratory disease only considers airborne transmission mode; dose\u2010response model, on the other hand, is a more general exposure and risk assessment approach that can assess infection risk from multiple transmission modes.12 To assess the risk of indirect contact transmission of respiratory diseases, the processes starting from the deposition of aerosolized pathogens onto surfaces and the transfer of pathogens from contaminated surfaces to hands and from hands to mucous membranes have to be considered. After each expiration action, more pathogens would be deposited on the contaminated surfaces. More pathogens would accumulate on the hand after each contact. The viability of the pathogen decays exponentially with time. Therefore, a nonlinear process should be considered. Nicas and Sun13 have developed a Markov chain risk assessment model in which the indirect contact transmission is one of the exposure pathways. Their work has provided a foundation for this kind of research. Their model assumes a steady\u2010state pathogen load on the contaminated surfaces for simplicity. Nicas and Best14 have developed a model assessing the indirect contact transmission risk by considering an average pathogen load on hand. Atkinson and Wein2 have developed an indirect contact transmission model with a simplification of assuming all the viruses on the susceptible hand to die off before each new hand contact of the contaminated surface. Wan et al.5 used mathematical sequences to describe the indirect contact transmission process and to assess the exposure level. Wan et al.15 used some integrals to replace some components in the mathematical sequences for simplification.",

Three pathogens capable to be transmitted via indirect contact were considered: influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus. Influenza can spread rapidly to susceptible people by both direct and indirect routes. Although droplet transmission is thought to be the primary mode of influenza transmission, there is also evidence to support indirect contact transmission of influenza.16 RSV is the most important cause of respiratory infection in young children worldwide.17 Although almost all children are vulnerable toward RSV, it can also infect adults. Rhinovirus is the most frequent cause of the common cold in both adults and children, which may cause serious respiratory tract disease and exacerbations of asthma.18, 19 In this work, the indirect contact risks of these three diseases were assessed in two indoor environments, a hospital ward and an aircraft cabin. Nosocomial infections among patients and health\u2010care workers frequently occur in hospital environments. Due to high occupant density, the aircraft cabin is another typical environment where infection of respiratory diseases easily spread. Given the focus on the relative magnitude of risk, the model of Wan et al.5 was simplified. The results revealed and quantified the relative importance of different factors in indirect contact transmission and provided additional information for consideration on infection control and building environmental design.",

It was expected that the infection risks to the diseases should generally increase with the reduction of the ACH in the ward because a higher ventilation rate should more efficiently dilute the infectious particles and remove them from the indoor environment before they can deposit on the surfaces. However, this was not always observed. In the upward cough case, when the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, the infection risks of patient M1 and the health\u2010care worker to the three diseases were reduced by 9.5%, but the infection risks of patient M3 to the three diseases were increased by 7.9%. In the lateral cough case, when the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, the infection risks of patient M1 and the health\u2010care worker to the three diseases were also increased by 31.1%. Changing the air exchange rate changes advection and turbulence, thus changing the deposition patterns of infectious particles. Under the higher ventilation rate, more infectious particles were dispersed to some positions by the stronger air flow. Therefore, more pathogens were deposited on the surfaces around these positions in the higher ACH case, resulting in higher exposure to some patients and the health\u2010care worker. When the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, the average infection risk among the patients and health\u2010care worker to the three diseases in the upward cough case was reduced by 3.7%, but was increased by 16.2% in the lateral cough case.",

In contrast, the other eight passengers, seated at A6, B6, C7, A3, B3, C3, B1, and C1, had increased infection risks to the three diseases when the ventilation rate in the cabin was nearly doubled. This was also due to the air flow under the higher ACH bringing more infectious particles to some regions in the cabin. Therefore, the particle deposition on some surfaces in these regions increased, resulting in higher pathogen loads on these contaminated surfaces.

It has been conclusively recognized that higher ventilation rate has an advantage in reducing the infection risk of respiratory diseases by airborne transmission. However, from the results of the current study, the indirect contact transmission risks were not always reduced when ventilation rate is increased in some cases. Doubling the ventilation rate only decreases the average risk by less than 20%. In a previous study, the infection risk through airborne transmission was decreased by 41% on average when the ventilation rate was nearly doubled,5 indicating that ventilation rate has a lower significance on indirect contact transmission than it does on airborne transmission. In both environments, there were some susceptibles who had higher infection risks under a higher ventilation rate. As the air flow pattern under different ventilation rates are different, increase in ventilation rate may disperse more infectious particles to some regions in the premises and outweigh the dilution effect in these regions. One experimental study also found that higher ventilation rate might increase the exposure level of respiratory pathogens for some susceptibles located further away from the sources due to the same reason.36\n",

Some participants kept repeating eye\u2010rubbing and nose\u2010picking activities; others rarely touched their eyes, mouths, or noses. For those participants who tend to touch their mucous frequently, their infection risk would obviously be higher. For comparison purpose, every susceptible person was considered to have the same contact frequency. The three pathogens showed different sensitivities of indirect contact transmission risk to contact frequency. As the contact frequencies are nonlinearly related to the exposure, the variation of risk among the three diseases was larger when the contact frequencies were nearly doubled than when the ventilation rates were nearly doubled. The contact frequencies were found to have more significant effect on the risk of indirect contact transmission than the ventilation rate. Therefore, it is more effective to lower the infection risk via indirect contact transmission by reducing the hand contacts than controlling the ventilation rate.",

Another study by Thatcher et al.38 showed that the particle deposition rate in a carpeted room was about double of the rate in a room with bare surfaces. If a doubled pathogen load on a fabric surface was considered to cater for the particle deposition rate difference, the infection risk for contacting fabric material would be approximately doubled. Contacting fabric materials would result in a higher indirect contact transmission risk toward influenza A virus than contacting nonfabric materials. However, due to the much higher pathogen transfer efficiencies and better survival rates of RSV and rhinovirus on nonfabric materials, infection risks of these two diseases of contacting nonfabric materials were still a few orders of magnitude higher than the infection risk of contacting fabric materials. Therefore, contacting nonfabric materials still resulted in a much higher indirect contact transmission risk in the cases of RSV and rhinovirus.",

The choice of surfaces contacted by occupants, however, may affect the percentage difference of the risks when varying the air change rate, since increase in air exchange rate does not uniformly decrease the pathogen load on all surfaces.

Generally, the indoor surface material was found to be the most significant influencing factor in the indirect contact transmission risk for at least two pathogens out of the three; human behavior\u2014the frequencies of hand contacts\u2014could also affect the indirect contact transmission risks of the three pathogens significantly; ventilation rate was found to be least significant in indirect contact transmission among these three factors, whereas in some situations increase in ventilation rate was also found to increase the risks of some susceptible persons. Although the air pollutant concentration in a building will decrease when ventilation rate is increased, the air pollutant is not perfectly mixed and the change in ventilation rate in a room will change the airflow pattern as well. Thus, airflow under an increased ventilation rate may transport more pollutant to some regions in a room. If there are occupants in these regions, their exposure and risk to the air pollutant will be higher than that in the lower ventilation rate case. In case of particulate matter, more particles may be transported to some regions and deposited onto surfaces around these regions under a different ventilation rate. This was observed in the experimental and numerical results from the previous studies.5, 26 Therefore, increase in ventilation rate does not necessarily reduce the risks of all routes of transmission. Reducing the hand contact rates on contaminant surfaces and mucous membranes could reduce the infection risk significantly. Therefore, reducing unnecessary hand contacts on surface and on eyes and nose are important personal hygiene practices. Fabric material contributes much lower risk than nonfabric material for RSV and rhinovirus. The risk of indirect contact transmission could be up to three orders of magnitude higher when contacting contaminated nonfabric surface than contacting contaminated fabric surface. However, choice of indoor surface material also affects the indoor concentrations of other pollutants. Therefore, the current results alone do not lead to the conclusion that fabric material should always be used as indoor surfaces. Also, it should be noted that the findings on the ventilation effect are for indirect contact transmission risk only in the current study. For the overall disease transmission risk, where airborne transmission and other transmission routes shall also be considered, ventilation is definitely playing a more important role as indicated from many studies. Further studies can be focused on evaluating the effect of ventilation rate on the combined infection risk of indirect contact transmissions, airborne transmission, and droplet spray transmission; and the effectiveness of disinfection of inner surfaces(39,40) and the use of antimicrobial coating(41) on the indirect contact transmission of respiratory infection.",
