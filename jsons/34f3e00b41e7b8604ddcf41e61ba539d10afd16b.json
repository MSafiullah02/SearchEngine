Even though viral URI are a major global economic and social problem, surprisingly little research has been conducted to attempt to prevent them or reduce their transmission, probably because URI (with the exception of epidemic influenza) are generally considered to be mild and self-limited. Based on the research to date, public health nurses can use several promising strategies for prevention: (a) provide more tailored educational messages regarding preventive strategies such as vaccination, hand hygiene, spatial separation of infected household members, avoidance of antibiotics to treat viral URI, and environmental cleaning (e.g., for toys or other shared items), which are delivered personally rather than passively (e.g., pamphlets placed in a waiting room); (b) use each patient encounter in any setting to encourage influenza vaccination for relevant risk groups; (c) encourage use of alcohol hand sanitizers by household members during the cold and flu season; and (d) provide opportunities for skill development for adult and child household members (e.g., cover your cough, when to seek care or an antibiotic).",

The common cold is the most frequent and universal infection; most people have as many as 200 colds in a lifetime. Colds cause more illness in children than all other diseases combined and are responsible for up to 50% of school absenteeism. Colds, for example, account for approximately 25 million primary care visits, 1.6 million visits to the emergency department, and 42 million missed work or school days annually in the U.S. (Gonzales et al., 2006; Heikkinen & Jarvinen, 2003) . The economic burden of non-influenza URI alone is about $40 billion annually (Fendrick, Monto, Nightengale, & Sarnes, 2003) . Even in non-epidemic years, 4500,000 persons in the United States are hospitalized annually with influenza-associated disease and 20,000-40,000 die (Thompson et al., 2003) . The 2003-2004 end-of-season hospitalization rate for influenza was 8.9 per 10,000 children aged 0-4 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005a) .",

In general, virus is deposited into the front of the nasal passages by contaminated fingers or by droplets from coughs and sneezes (Hendley & Gwaltney, 1988) . The virus is then transported by mucociliary action to the back of the nose and onto the adenoid area where it attaches to a receptor that is located on the surface of nasal epithelial cells. The receptor fits into a docking port on the surface of the virus (Winther et al., 1997) . After attachment, virus particles are produced and the infected cell ruptures, releasing newly made cold virus to infect other cells in the nose and start the process over again. The incubation period is 8-12 hr, and the time to peak symptoms is 36-72 hr. Small doses of virus (1-30 particles) are sufficient to produce infection (Douglas, 1970) . Cold symptoms result from host inflammatory mediators that cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, manifested as rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, and coughing.",

One of the predominant features of influenza viruses is their ability to mutate rapidly (''antigenic drift'') or undergo genomic reassortment (''antigenic shift''), resulting in the need for frequent modifications of vaccines to keep pace with the rapidly changing antigenic characteristics of the virus. These two features of the influenza virus-the fast and unpredictable antigenic changes of immune targets and the ability to reassort and circulate among non-human reservoirs (birds and pigs, for example)-are responsible for much of the global spread and persistence of the infection (Lavenu et al., 2006) .",

Generally, there is a single receptor-binding site, although certain avian influenza viruses like H5N1 are able to bind to different target cells, making possible the direct transfer of avian flu between birds and humans. The virus-receptor complex is then endocytosed and replication occurs rapidly, with viral shedding occurring within 6 hr of infection. Infectious particles are released from the plasma membrane of epithelial cells by budding, which facilitates the rapid spread to other cells within the lung. Unlike viruses causing the common cold, however, influenza virus replicates in cells of the lower as well as the upper respiratory tract (Kamps, Hoffmann, & Preiser, 2006) .",

In one study of workingage adults, the average work time missed due to influenza-like illness was 1.3 days and work loss valued at $137/person/year (Akazawa, Sindelar, & Paltiel, 2003) . In a U.K. survey of 411 workers, the average missed work per episode of flu-like illness was 2.8 days (Keech, Scott, & Ryan, 1998) . French researchers in a prospective study reported that 38.3% of household contacts of an influenza-positive index case became secondary cases, 57% of whom sought medical care at least once. The mean duration of illness was 8 days in index cases and 7 days in secondary cases seeking medical care (Carrat et al., 2002) . Epidemics of influenza typically occur during the winter months and are associated with 4500,000 hospitalizations and about 36,000 deaths/year . Among healthy children aged 6-23 months in the Boston area, the rate of outpatient visits during influenza periods was 8 times higher than in noninfluenza periods, and the rate of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease was 2.7 times (O'Brien et al., 2004) .",

Unfortunately, the rates of inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics are similar for nurse practitioners and physicians (Ladd, 2005) . Further, the prescription rate is an underestimate of this problem because high rates of unprescribed antibiotic use for viral URI and the availability of antibiotics without prescription have been reported in the community (Larson & Grullon-Figueroa, 2004; Larson, Dilone, Garcia, & Smolowitz, 2006) .",

Vaccination significantly reduces influenza-related costs in healthy children as well as their unvaccinated family members. For example, the unvaccinated household members of children who were vaccinated against influenza had 42% fewer febrile illnesses (p 5 .04), 70% fewer missed school days (p 5 .02), and significantly fewer physician visits (p 5 .007) compared with unvaccinated household members of control children (Hurwitz et al., 2000) . Despite its effectiveness, there continues to be inadequate vaccine coverage for all recommended groups, Table 1 . Even in the absence of full adherence to vaccination, however, herd immunity confers protection. For example, vaccination of 25% of 1.5-18-year-old children conferred protection to 8%-18% of adults 35 years in several communities (Piedra et al., 2005) . ",

Parental knowledge has been shown to be a more important predictor of seeking care and antibiotics for URI than child care center policies (Friedman, Lee, Kleinman, & Finkelstein, 2003) . However, although parental knowledge regarding URI and antibiotic use seems to be one important predictor of behavior, interventions that have only included parental education have had limited impact on practices regarding viral URI (Taylor et al., 2005) . In one recent educational intervention, teleconferencing between center staff (sometimes also including parents) with a clinician was provided to child care centers regarding acute health problems that might require exclusion from child care. It was estimated that 93.8% of 940 teleconferences prevented an office or emergency room visit (McConnochie et al., 2005) . While this intervention prevented loss of work time to parents and reduced unnecessary health care visits, it was costly and not practical in a home setting. In several studies in child care centers, instructional programs directed at the children and their providers have resulted in significant reductions in URI Niffenegger, 1997) .",

Since the threat of avian influenza, parental attitudes toward immunizing their children have been shown to improve considerably.

Rabie and Curtis (2006) conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effect of hand hygiene on risk of URI in the community. From a pool of 410 studies, 7 clinical trials published in English met their inclusion criteria. These studies reported risk reductions of 5%-44% and the authors concluded that hand hygiene could potentially reduce the risk of URI by 16% (95% CI: 11-21%).

Several recent randomized, blinded clinical trials (RCT), however, have reported reductions in the incidence and duration of URI, including influenzalike illnesses, with the use of ginseng (McElhaney, Goel, Toane, Hooten, & Shan, 2006; Predy et al., 2005) . Even more intriguing was a placebo-controlled, double-blinded RCT, which demonstrated in 227 volunteers that ginseng administered for a period of 12 weeks during which they received influenza vaccine had significantly fewer colds and significantly higher antibody titers and natural killer cell activity levels, i.e., the ginseng appeared to potentiate the effects of the vaccine (Scaglione, Cattaneo, Alessandria, & Cogo, 1996) . Ginseng appears to be safe and nontoxic; in several clinical trials including 4500 adults, reported side effects were comparable to the placebo arm (McElhaney et al., 2004; Predy et al., 2005) .

Further, studies that have been conducted are generally of poor quality, almost all have been funded by manufacturers of products, and the results are inconsistent for most interventions that have been tested. Most herbal remedies commonly used by the public (echinacea, vitamins C and E, zinc products) have been shown to have little, if any, preventive effect for URI. There have been, however, several recent clinical trials of ginseng in which there was a protective effect demonstrated when compared with placebo. This potential therapy warrants further study.",
