Cardiovascular care has experienced challenges to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) from a safety (personal protective equipment-PPE), staffing (healthcare worker infection rates) and patient welfare perspective. Recently an ~40% reduction in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presentations for PPCI has been reported during the COVID-19 crisis. 1 Reduced STEMI admissions could relate to altered patient behaviour, disrupted care pathways, or altered cardiovascular risk factors pertaining to partial or complete lockdown conditions during the pandemic ( Figure 1 ).",

Moreover, a proportion of STEMIs including elderly, female and diabetic patients present silently or atypically delaying acute diagnosis. COVID-19 public health warnings may have inadvertently contributed to reduced STEMI patient contact with emergency medical services (EMS) or primary care physicians. Cocooned elderly patients through reduced family contact may also have impaired ability to raise the alarm. Thus altered patient behaviour is one likely contributing factor to reduced STEMI presentations.",

Additional factors include disruption to acute triage and inhospital care as EMS, emergency room and in-hospital services became overwhelmed by the number and severity of COVID-19 cases to the relative exclusion of other acute medical admissions.",

In the short-term, STEMI under-detection is likely to presage more acute deaths from under-revascularization, including by lethal arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock and cardiac rupture at rates unheralded in recent PPCI history. Medium and long-term complications such as heart failure, sudden cardiac death and post-infarct angina are also likely to increase. Dealing with the legacy of this unrevascularized cohort will present challenges to multiple cardiology services from structural heart disease, to arrhythmia management to cardiac surgery. ",
