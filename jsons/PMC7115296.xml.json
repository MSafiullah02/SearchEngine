These cases were systematically reported and were reviewed including line listing.10 Statistical analysis was done using Minitab version 17 software (Minitab, State College, PA). A significant P value was considered for P <.05. Boxplots of time to specified events were generated as follows: lapsed time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, onset of symptoms to confirmation of diagnosis, hospitalization to confirmation of diagnosis, and from onset of symptoms to death. These times (in days) were calculated based on the differences between the date of symptoms onset, date of hospitalization, date of diagnosis confirmation, and date of death (if this was the case).",

During the study period 2017-2018, there was a large outbreak in Saudi Arabia in June 2017 involving 3 health care settings.15, 16, 17 The most common route of transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs is health care\u2013acquired infections from patients to HCWs.5,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 There are multiple factors contributing to the transmission within health care facilities and these factors were recently reviewed12 and are clearly reported,5, 18, 19, 21 as summarized in a previous study.12 Therefore, all health care facilities should adopt strategies for early detection and isolation of patients suspected to have MERS-CoV infection.13, 20, 26 HCWs with MERS-CoV infection were either asymptomatic or had mild disease, and fatal cases were described.27 Transmission of MERS-CoV among HCWs was reported to result from asymptomatic HCWs.27\n",
