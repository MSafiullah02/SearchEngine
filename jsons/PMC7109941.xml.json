The fundamental theorem of IT states that it is possible to transmit information through a noisy channel (at any rate less than channel capacity) with an arbitrary small probability of error. This was a surprising and counter-intuitive result. The key idea to achieve such transmission is to wait for several blocks of information and use code words, adding redundancy to the transmitted information [3, 4].",

There is a clear association between these concepts: a sequence with low entropy (high redundancy) will, in principle, be more compressible and the length of the compressed sequence gives an estimate of its complexity, and consequently, of its entropy [20]. The drawback of this method is its dependency on the compression procedures, which might fail to recognize complex organization levels in the sequences. Although data compression is closely related with IT applications, a complete review of this topic is out of the scope of this work; see other surveys on average mutual information (AMI) applications [21], Kolmogorov complexity-based features [22] and a comprehensive review by Giancarlo et al.

This is reflected in the final structure of the review, which attempts to take an application-driven goal-dependent approach. Therefore, the sections are organized in global analysis and comparison (block-entropy estimation and resolution-free metrics based on iterative maps), local analysis (classification of motifs, prediction of transcription factor binding sites and sequence characterization based on linguistic complexity and entropic profiles), high-level associations merging DNA, RNA or proteins with sequence-independent properties.

Zipf and redundancy analysis using rank distributions had already discriminated between coding and noncoding regions [83]. Zipf\u2019s approach is based on calculating the histograms of word occurrences in linguistic texts and ranking them from most to less frequent. One remarkable feature in natural languages is the Zipf\u2019s law, where a linear relation of this function in double logarithmic scale is found. The results obtained by Mantegna and colleagues [83] show that, by applying Zipf\u2019s regression, noncoding regions are closer to natural languages in terms of regression parameters and exhibit more redundancy than coding regions, as measured by block entropies.

He argues that, despite the tremendous progress of communication engineering in the past decades, communication theory remains completely neglected by biosemiotics and biology. One of the possible reasons might be the focus on semantic aspects and meaning of the former, while IT scope is on literal communication, leading to the irony that both areas \u2018have not been able to communicate with each other\u2019. It is expected that the role of IT in molecular biology and sequence analysis, will indeed increase. DNA assembly problems [147] and metagenomic analysis [148] are just recent examples of this trend.",
