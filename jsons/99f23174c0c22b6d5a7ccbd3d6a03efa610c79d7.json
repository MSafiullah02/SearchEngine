In parallel with echocardiography and other imaging modalities, CMR and CT should only be performed if the expected information is critical for clinical management and can be justified in the face of the following considerations: (i) risk of transportation of critically ill or high-risk patients; (ii) time duration of CMR; (iii) possible/significant risk of infection for professionals (technicians, physicians, nurses, and other personnel); (iv) possible/significant risk of contamination of equipment and facilities, leading to the need for full disinfection; and (v) whether the test is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, or whether this can be achieved based simply upon the clinical probability.

Whilst this might conceivably provide some possible synergies and opportunities to gain information about the cardiovascular system, this requires bespoke protocols that are not widely employed. Dedicated coronary CT angiography is therefore usually required. One emerging clinical issue is that numerous patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 experience elevated troponins with and without signs of obstructive coronary artery disease. In this situation, coronary CT angiography can be of great help in excluding or confirming an acute coronary syndrome if the clinical picture is uncertain, substituting for an invasive coronary angiogram and the associated exposure of all the members of the cardiac catheterization laboratory team. 6 Coronary CT angiography is also increasingly used to assess patients with chronic coronary syndromes, and can be considered in the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with severe symptoms. Another important and emerging role for CT in the pandemic is as a replacement for transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) to rule out the presence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage before direct current (DC) cardioversion, thereby limiting operator exposure (Key point 3). Echocardiography should not routinely be performed in patients with typical signs of COVID-19 disease. Indeed, it should be restricted to those patients in whom it is likely to result in a change in management. Nevertheless, many COVID-19 patients will develop a range of different cardiovascular manifestations which will require a bedside echocardiographic study. 7 Moreover, there are reasons to believe that the need for echocardiography might expand further as we understand more about COVID-19, with early reports indicating that patients with established cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors have worse prognosis than others, and are more likely to be admitted to hospital and need respiratory support. 1 Dyspnoea is a typical finding in patients with cardiac disease, and echocardiography may be indicated in the diagnostic work-up, particularly in patients with subacute onset of dyspnoea, oedema, or cardiac murmurs and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Conversely, a normal pro-BNP test can frequently be used to exclude the need for an echocardiogram in patients with dyspnoea or oedema.",

It is, however, important not to cover the screen in a way that reduces the view for the echocardiographer. This may reduce the quality of the study and increase scan duration. Similarly, the keyboard should be fully operative during the investigation. To facilitate the cleaning of the scanner, all additional 3-D and single-Doppler probes should be removed before the scanning starts, if they are not needed for proper diagnosis. ECG leads should also be removed, although this may make the recordings of loops more difficult and potentially more time consuming. In high-volume centres, one can consider dedicating separate scanners to be used exclusively for COVID-19-positive patients, that remain within designated COVID-19 areas. No additional disinfection procedure is necessary for a TOE probe as every location should have proper routines for cleaning and disinfection of these probes. A protective coat on the TOE probe might also be considered.",

Patients placed in the left lateral position with the scanner positioned on the right side of the bench will result in the longest possible distance between the faces of the patient and the echocardiographer. The contamination of the scanner by airborne droplets from the patient will also probably be minimized. However, the preferred patient position is different among echocardiographers, and these recommendations should not be a hindrance to performing high-quality fast echocardiograms. A surgical mask on the patient will also reduce contamination by air droplets.",

Less critical patients are usually examined in their ward rooms. Dedicated room(s) may be prepared in the echocardiographic lab, where unnecessary equipment can be removed to make the cleaning of the room as easy as possible. However, there is less risk of virus spread if the COVID-19 pandemic and cardiac imaging echocardiographer brings the echocardiographic machine to the patient, and the patient can remain in their isolation. Local factors must be considered with dedicated COVID-19 areas respected, ensuring COVID-19 'clean' and 'dirty' areas are not mixed. Reading and conference rooms where echocardiograms are presented on small PC screens may prevent the recommended 2 m distance between the experts. Thus, larger rooms, with projectors that can present the images on large screens are recommended. Virtual communication technology that allows several colleagues to simultaneously visualise images on geographically remote screens is the preferred solution for multidisciplinary team meetings.",
