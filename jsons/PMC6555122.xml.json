Analyses of geographic information system data have been used to map risk of exposure to disease [13].

Kilkari is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age\u2013appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one year old. Accredited social health activists (ASHA) mobilize women in the community to attend outreach and primary health center activities where auxiliary nurse midwives collect and register details of mothers and their pregnancies and, after delivery, children born in their catchment areas. Mobile Academy is an interactive voice response (IVR) audio training course for ASHAs in India. The training material delivered over the phone is designed to refresh their knowledge of life-saving preventative health behaviors and improve their interpersonal communications skills.",

The MOTECH system uses the last menstrual period or the delivery date to determine the schedule of messages to be delivered.

Merging data files will be complex given the nature of identifiers across databases. An MCTS record does not have a beneficiary ID. Instead, it has a \u201cMother\u201d (pregnancy) ID or a \u201cChild\u201d ID. In other words, MCTS tracks pregnancies and births, rather than women. When Kilkari first went live in October 2015, it mirrored the MCTS approach and generated subscription IDs for each pregnancy and then birth. However, the new RCH database does have a unique beneficiary ID, which enables the system to track an individual woman through her multiple pregnancies and the births of children. The architecture of the MOTECH database and Kilkari was changed in December 2016 to introduce a unique beneficiary ID and MOTECH was then integrated with RCH in mid-2017. There is an additional complexity, namely that MOTECH used to allow multiple Kilkari subscriptions on one mobile number, assuming a single phone could be shared by a number of women in a joint family. However, a decision was made to remove this feature in 2017 (July 28 for RCH and October 6 for MCTS) due to the complexity it created in analyzing system-generated data. Hence the analytic time horizon assumed in the analysis may span from 2017-2018 after the MCTS-RCH integration occurred and the aforementioned changes were made. The merging of datasets will occur in India, and only de-identified data will be stored on the hard drives and used in this analysis. As part of Study Aim 1, we will examine the quality of the data for completeness, including patterns and any geographic clustering in missingness.",

Once identified as part of baseline survey activities and randomized to receive Kilkari content (or no content at all), phone numbers will be fed directly into the MOTECH database for provision of program services. For pregnant women, additional data collected as part of baseline household surveys include demographic factors (age, education, parity, literacy), socioeconomic characteristics (household assets, conditions), health care seeking and practices, as well as data on digital literacy and phone access. These data can be linked to MOTECH, IVR, and call center records to provide additional data elements. Overall, these data as well as data on technology performance (receipt of messages) and user engagement (behavioral performance) with content will help estimate exposure to Kilkari used in the assessment of causality as part of the RCT. For ASHAs, baseline survey data will include similar data elements on demographic, socioeconomic, and mobile literacy and phone access as well as knowledge and work-related variables linked to reported motivation and satisfaction. Overall, these added data elements can be linked to IVR and call record data for this subpopulation of Mobile Academy and Kilkari users in four districts of MP where the RCT is underway.",

The transformation of variables may be achieved by a variety of techniques including the creation of composite indicators and box-cox transformations. Unsupervised machine learning techniques, including dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal components analysis or K-means clustering, will be carried out as appropriate. Principal component analysis uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The first principal component has the largest possible variance and accounts for the highest proportion of the variance in the data, with each succeeding component accounting for the highest variance possible after accounting for the previous components. K-means clustering is a way to use data to uncover natural groupings within a heterogeneous population (Table 1). To uncover patterns, the algorithm starts by first assigning data points into random groups. The group centers are then calculated, and the group memberships are re-assigned based on the distances between each data point and the group centers. This process is repeated until there are no changes in the group memberships from the previous iteration [16]. In its application to Mobile Academy, K-means clustering will be used to detect patterns in ASHA engagement with training content, including training initiation and completion. Among Kilkari users, K-means clustering will be used to assess patterns in exposure to content by user characteristics based on data elements available in the RCH, including parity, age, and geographic area.",

Na\u00efve Bayes and decision trees have good tolerance to missing values, while NNs and SVM do not. NNs and Na\u00efve Bayes have difficulty handling irrelevant and redundant attributes (ie, extra variables with no useful information or variables with too many categories and too few numbers), while SVM and decision trees are insensitive towards them. Variables with high correlation negatively affect the performance of both Na\u00efve Bayes and NNs, whereas SVM are relatively robust to correlated variables. While Na\u00efve Bayes is robust to noise, NNs are sensitive to poor measurement of variables and susceptible to overfitting. NNs and SVM perform well with multidimensional data and when there is a nonlinear relationship between predictor and outcome. Na\u00efve Bayes requires less memory for both training and validation phase, whereas NN requires large memory allocation across all phases. SVM and NNs usually outperform other methods while Na\u00efve Bayes may yield less accurate results. Table 3 compares the strengths and weakness of different supervised machine learning methods.",

While 20% delivery rates of successful outbound dialing calls are standard in the mobile industry, limitations in the timeliness of problem identification represent a missed opportunity for improving program exposure using, for example, call retry logics and systems. In South Africa, over 80% of short messaging service (SMS) messages were successfully delivered as part of MomConnect. SMS as a delivery channel has a much higher success rate than outbound dialing calls but suffers from other weaknesses in countries where illiteracy rates are high and local language fonts are not widely available on devices.

Confounding will be an issue due to the many unmeasured variables associated with exposure such as mobile phone ownership, and registration into the pregnancy tracking database, and outcomes such as active listening to messages and adoption of healthy behaviors. Call answering does not automatically mean listening to the message by the intended client (eg, ASHAs or pregnant women) and as such, our analyses will be limited in its ability to identify the listener (information bias). However, the potential benefits of having other family members listen to information content could be immense.
