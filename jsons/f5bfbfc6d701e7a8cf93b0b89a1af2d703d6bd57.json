Improvements in detection technologies in instrumentation and chemistries to label these probes have made it possible to use up to six spectrally distinguishable probes per reaction well. With the remarkable advances made in the characterization of human genome diversity, it has been possible to describe empirical patterns of SNPs and haplotype variation in the genome of diverse human populations. These patterns have revealed that the human genome is structured in blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). Because SNPs tend to be in LD with each other, common haplotypes share common SNPs and thus the majority of the diversity in a region can be characterized by typing a very small number of SNPs; so-called tag SNPs. Herein lies the advantage of the multiplexing ability of molecular beacons, since it becomes possible to use as few as 30 probes to interrogate several haplotypes in a highthroughput approach. Thus, through the combined use of tag SNPs and molecular beacons it becomes possible to type individuals for clinically relevant haplotypes in a high-throughput manner at a cost that is orders of magnitude less than that for high throughput sequencing methods.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Sanjay Tyagi the inventor of molecular beacons (1) once wrote:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Imagine that you have a magic reagent to which you add a droplet of a body fluid from a patient; you wait for a moment and a glow appears in the tube holding the mixture; the glow not only tells you which pathogen is responsible for the patient's illness, but also indicates which drugs to use to treat the disease.

To date, more than 11 million SNPs have been recorded in dbSNP, the public repository for DNA variation data (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/SNP/index.html) (see Chapter 3 for details). Decorating the human genome at a frequency of one in every 500-1,000 bp, they are the most common form of human variation and can serve as high-resolution genetic markers. This variation, which represents a legacy of our evolutionary past and in the future may be a treasure trove of information paving the way to personalized medicine, may at least partially explain the wide range of phenotypic differences observed among individuals and populations (7) (8) (9) .

Eleven million SNPs discovered to date appear to be not entirely random. When a new mutation arises, it is associated with neighboring variants present on the same chromosome or haploid DNA molecule, forming what is commonly known as a ''haplotype.'' When two alleles lying on the same chromosome are always observed together, or at least more often than expected by chance, these two variants are said to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The HapMap project, a natural extension of the Human Genome Project, was a pioneer in describing empirically the patterns of SNP and haplotype variation in the human genome and in obtaining a general LD map in populations of different ethnic origins (10) . HapMap data clearly demonstrate that the human genome is organized in a LD blocklike structure and that these LD blocks are often disrupted by recombination hotspots (11, 12) . When SNPs are in LD with each other, redundant information is contained within the haplotype (i.e., by knowing the marker at one locus, we can predict the marker that will occur at the linked loci nearby). Thus, when one infers haplotypes within a region of reasonable LD, the diversity of haplotypes is accounted for by a few common haplotypes and lots of rare ones. The common haplotypes will share a number of SNPs in common with each other, whereas the rarer haplotypes will be characterized by carrying the rarer alleles at certain loci. Thus, one can capture the majority of the diversity within a region by typing those SNPs which allow one to cover the most diversity; so-called tag SNPs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1007, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1011, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Currently, HapMap phase II provides the most complete available resource for selecting tag SNPs genomewide (12) .

The first is the small amounts of nucleic acid present in clinical specimens. This can be overcome by use of differing nucleic acid amplification strategies, most notably polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This and other methods such as nucleic acid sequence based amplification allow the selective amplification and enrichment of a locus of interest by severalthousand-fold over other nucleic acid sequences present (25) . The second obstacle is unambiguous detection of the SNP. Herein lies an intrinsic property of nucleic acid chemistry that can be exploited. A unique property of nucleic acid hybridization is its extremely high fidelity. Such molecular interactions are the most specific and stable known in nature. It becomes possible to monitor and detect hybridization of nucleic acids if it is accompanied by an assayable change in conformation. Two principal methods have emerged in detecting such assayable changes in conformation. The first, TaqMan (26) , depends upon the monitoring of enzymatic nucleic acid probe cleavage, resulting in fluorescence (see Chapters 18 and 19 for details). The second, molecular beacons (1), detects a conformational change in the probe, which fluoresces upon hybridization. We will focus principally on the use of molecular beacons. Molecular beacons are single-stranded oligonucleotide probes with a stem-and-loop structure (see Fig. 17 .2). The loop is complementary to a known sequence in a target nucleic acid sequence, whereas the stem forms by the hybridization of the arm sequences on either side of the loop sequence. A fluorescent moiety is covalently linked to the extremity of one arm sequence and a quencher is covalently linked to the extremity of another arm. Thus, the fluorophore and quencher are directly juxtaposed when the stem is formed and are in extremely close proximity to each other. This association prevents fluorescence from being emitted from the fluorophore. When the loop portion of the molecule encounters a perfectly complementary target, the entire molecule undergoes a conformational change that results in the separation of the arms of the stem. This causes a restoration of fluorescence to the fluorophore as it is moved away from the quencher. Alterations to the length of the probe region strongly influence the stability and Thermal denaturation profiles of molecular beacons when they are with wild-type or mutant targets. The wild-type target is represented by solid lines and the mutant target is represented by dashed lines. The absence of target is indicated by a dotted line. The conformational state of the molecular beacon is shown directly above the line. By careful design of molecular beacons, mismatched targets can be easily discriminated from perfectly matched targets with ''windows of discrimination'' as high as 10\u00b0C. The optimal temperature for the annealing step from this thermal denaturation profile is found to be 50\u00b0C and therefore is used in real-time PCR. (c) An example of how each molecular beacon, the ''red''-labeled or the ''green''-labeled, competes to hybridize to the same region depending on whether it is perfectly complementary to the region. specificity of the probe-target hybrid, contributing to the extreme specificity of molecular beacons. A wide variety of differently colored fluorophores are possible with molecular beacons (27) , thus enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in the same solution by using molecular beacons designed to detect differing targets each labeled with a spectrally distinguishable fluorophore.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 495, "end": 499, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3433, "end": 3437, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1455, "end": 1462, "text": "Fig. 17", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The above-mentioned properties of molecular beacons enable their use in monitoring the progress of nucleic acid amplification reactions (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) , self-reporting oligonucleotide arrays, and the detection of messenger RNA in living cells (33) (34) (35) (36) . Molecular beacons are especially adept at the detection of SNPs since they recognize their targets with exquisite specificity unlike conventional linear probes, owing to their hairpin structure (37) . Thermodynamic studies where linear and stem-loop probes were compared have revealed that this enhanced specificity is a general feature of conformationally constrained probes such as molecular beacons. Thus, specificity can be ''tuned'' by altering the degree to which the probes are conformationally constrained. Practically this involves altering the length of the stem structure in relation to the length of the loop. In applications such as SNP detection, molecular beacons can be designed to bind over a wide range of temperatures such that only perfectly complementary probe-target hybrids are formed. This keeps mismatched probes which vary by even as much as one base unbound and dark, whereas only perfectly complementary probe-target hybrids elicit fluorescence. Owing to these unique properties, the use of molecular beacons for SNP detection has proliferated broadly as has its expansion into a cost-effective high-throughput SNP diagnostic tool.

This is done by using oligonucleotides which contain either amino or sulfahydryl functional groups at either their 5 0 -ends or their 3 0 -ends.

The region where the SNP of interest occurs must be targeted and molecular beacons with as little as one base variant from this region must not bind under amplification conditions. To satisfy these constraints, the loop portion of the probe is made to be not more than 25 nucleotides in length. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the length of the loop, the more highly discriminating the probe will be. Care must be taken to ensure that the melting temperature of the probe-target hybrid is compatible with the annealing temperature of primers during PCR. With this part of the design complete, stem/arm sequences can be designed that allow the stem to dissociate at about 7-10\u00b0C above the annealing temperature of the primers during PCR. This design process is made more complex in certain examples where multiple primers are used in a single tube (as in the example given later in this chapter). The challenge when doing multiplex PCR is to optimize all the primers for all the PCRs first. This ensures that all primers make good amplicons at the same temperature. Molecular beacons can then be designed to be SNP-discriminating at the annealing temperature of the primers by alterations in loop size. It is always useful to verify the secondary structure of the designed molecular beacon to ensure that it does not contain secondary structures that restrict the loop from binding to a PCR target. The preferred program for nucleic acid secondary structure prediction is Zuker/mfold fold (http://www.bioinfo. rpi.edu/applications/mfold/). For extremely difficult situations where design for AT-or GC-rich regions makes the stability of annealing variable, this can be circumvented by a number of strategies such as sliding the loop region so the SNP is no longer at its center. A second strategy is to include the stem/arm sequences in the binding sequence so as to create an even more stable hybrid (this could be useful in AT-rich regions). Lastly, if these strategies prove unsuccessful, an additional annealing step for the purposes of detection can be programmed into the thermal cycling profile.

Indeed, DC-SIGN captures bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Helicobacter pylori, and certain Klebsiela pneumonia strains; viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and SARS coronavirus; and parasites such as Leishmania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni (47, (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 225, "end": 229, "text": "(44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 385, "end": 389, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 505, "end": 509, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 667, "end": 671, "text": "(47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 926, "end": 930, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "(47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1269, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1274, "text": "(50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1279, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1289, "text": "(53)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1294, "text": "(54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1299, "text": "(55)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1304, "text": "(56)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1309, "text": "(57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1314, "text": "(58)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1319, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Real-Time PCR"}, {"text": "In light of the ability of DC-SIGN to interact with a large plethora of pathogens, it is plausible that variation in its gene may influence the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases.

Specifically, it has been shown that two promoter variants, -871G and -336A, confer protection against tuberculosis. Similarly, the -336A variant has been reported to protect against parental HIV infection and to influence the severity of dengue pathogenesis (60, 61) .

Nevertheless, full resequencing approaches are unacceptably expensive and time consuming and, therefore, the most powerful and cost-effective way to perform association studies is by defining tag SNPs for a region of interest (see Section 17.1 for details). To do so, you have two alternatives: (a) Begin by fully resequencing the region under study in a subset of your cohort. Typically 20-30 individuals should be enough to capture the most common haplotypes in the population.

Then, upload the data in Haploview (a free software program provided by the HapMap consortium) and run Tagger to identify tag SNPs for your region (see Note 7).

A second modification is to use 2 0 -O-methyl molecular beacons, which intrinsically have a higher melting temperature than DNA-based molecular beacons.

Indeed, the use of admixed populations in association-mapping studies can be very useful for identification of disease-causing genetic variants that differ in frequency across parental populations. However, when the admixture event is too recent, allelic frequencies can differ coincidentally among cases and controls, reflecting a nonuniform genetic contribution from the parental populations to each subpopulation (i.e., cases and controls), rather than a genuine association between a given genetic variant and the phenotype under study.
