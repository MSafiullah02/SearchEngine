Visits are conducted with attention to local recommendations for patient care, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE). 1 Given that uveitis is often chronic, a patient-ophthalmologist partnership approach is common. If the uveitis is predictable, and the patient is familiar with their treatment plan, even an acute flare of posterior segment inflammation may be managed remotely. For patients whose uveitis is controlled on a stable drug schedule, history by conference plus standard blood tests may provide adequate review. However, intraocular pressure measurements in patients with a history of secondary ocular hypertension or glaucoma, or who have received depot corticosteroid, are essential to avoid glaucomatous damage.",

Aerosol-generating procedures that pose high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection are scrutinized carefully. 4 For example, bronchoscopy is likely unnecessary if the presentation is otherwise consistent with ocular sarcoidosis. Even lower risk procedures, such as neuroimaging and lumbar puncture when multiple sclerosis is suspected, are planned in collaboration with internist colleagues. Vitrectomy is deferred if possible, but may be essential for diagnosing certain conditions, such as vitreoretinal lymphoma or infectious retinitis. The operation can be performed under local anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care, rather than general anesthesia. If available for use in asymptomatic individuals, SARS-CoV-2 testing helps decisions around timing.",

The World Health Organization issued a warning that individuals with tuberculosis and COVID-19 may have worse outcomes, particularly if the anti-tubercular therapy is interrupted. 5 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the blood during acute infection, 6 and intraocular tissues express angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, which is a receptor for the virus, 7 raising the possibility of intraocular infection. However, to date there have been no published reports of COVID-19-associated uveitis, although subtle retinal microvascular pathology, and small lesions in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers are described. 8 There has been considerable discussion around the possibility that COVID-19 might be more common and/or more severe in persons who are pharmacologically immunosuppressed, including patients who are taking immunomodulatory drugs for non-infectious uveitis. Based on experience across multiple fields including rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology, immunomodulatory treatment does not appear to be a major risk factor for severe COVID-19, and the general recommendation is that such treatment should not be ceased in the absence of SARS-Cov-2 exposure or suspected or confirmed infection. [9] [10] [11] While immunomodulatory drugs are continued in patients with non-infectious uveitis, standard measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 -hand hygiene, distancing and selfisolation-and influenza vaccination are recommended. Patients have blood monitored for drug toxicity. Inflammatory cystoid macular edema and choroidal neovascularization are reviewed regularly, although a decision for retreatment may be based on clinical findings alone.",

The uveitis specialist works closely with the other treating physicians, and immunomodulatory treatment is held or tapered temporarily. In-person assessments are undertaken with PPE. Locally delivered corticosteroid is an option to avoid systemic drug activity: corticosteroid eye drops are highly effective for anterior uveitis, and periocular and intraocular corticosteroids as well as corticosteroid implants are considered for patients with posterior segment uveitis. An electronically actioned effort led by Singapore NHG Institute, Chandigarh PGIMER and Moorfields Eye Hospital has already produced an expert opinion statement to guide immunomodulatory therapy in patients with non-infectious uveitis (manuscript under review). To inform on the issue of immunomodulatory treatment in patients with inflammatory diseases as a group, new registries have been launched (e.g., COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance). 12 Long-term impact: Experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of immunomodulatory drugs in non-infectious uveitis will inform future treatment approaches. Patients taking these drugs have become more aware of the principles of infection control and the importance of vaccination, which will reduce their risk of infection overall.",
