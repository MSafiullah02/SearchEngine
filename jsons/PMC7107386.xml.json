Research on each pathogen of concern requires a tailored, comprehensive assessment by experts across multiple disciplines, who consider the broad implications of conducting or curbing such research. Thus, current and future moratoria on such research should only be implemented with input and consensus from a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including the community of clinicians and other healthcare providers who are the end beneficiaries and users of such research but who have historically been underrepresented in the policy discussions on this topic.",

Although some experiments were ultimately allowed to proceed, to date, no clear criteria have been defined for when moratoria should be placed [1, 2]. We, therefore, set out to provide an overview of the varied definitions of GOF research\u2014updated since the publication of our review [3] (Table 1)\u2014and an outline of its risks and benefits for the biomedical research and clinical medicine communities, as well as for society at large.",

Given the high likelihood that dangerous pathogens will continue to emerge, the biomedical research community requires the creation of a permanent review body that has broad representation and a transparent process of governance on the use of agents of concern to global health. Such a path forward will ensure public safety in preventing the accidental or intentional release of dangerous pathogens but also in avoiding unnecessary holds on research that could lead to important countermeasures to emerging public health threats.",
