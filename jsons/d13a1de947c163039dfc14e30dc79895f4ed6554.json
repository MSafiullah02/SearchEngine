Few reports compare virus infection between different donor types in pediatric patients. We retrospectively analyzed viral infections and the outcome of one hundred and seventy-one pediatric patients (median 7.38 years) who underwent allogeneic HSCT from matched related donor (MRD, n = 71), 10 of 10 HLA allelematched unrelated donors (MUD1; n = 29), 9 of 10 HLA allele-matched unrelated donors (MUD2; n = 40), and haploidentical donors (n = 31). PCR screening for BK virus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6, and CMV were performed routinely weekly. Infections between 0-30, 31-100, and 101 days-2 years were identified separately. BK virus and CMV reactivations were significantly low in MRD transplant patients (P = .046 and P < .0001, respectively), but incidences of all virus infections between MUD1, MUD2, and haplo-HSCT were found statistically not different. The OS was found to be affected by having one or multiple virus infection (P = .04 and P = .0008). Despite antiviral prophylaxis and treatments, post-transplant viral infections are associated with reduced overall survival. Haplo-HSCT is comparable with MUD transplantation in the setting of viral infections. A larger study group and prospective studies are needed to confirm this observation.

They reported CMV (16%), ADV (15%), and EBV (11%) frequently during period of CD4 T-cell lymphopenia and found that ADV and EBV reactivations had additional associations with the use of HLA-mismatched grafts. Rustia et al's 9 study was the third largest study of 140 pediatric patients with 40.7% MRD and 49.3% MUD. They found similar incidence results for CMV (21.4%), ADV (11.4%), and EBV (10%) like Hiwarkar et al.

Based on these observations, the haploidentical donor option could become the second choice when there are no suitable MRD in terms of viral infection. The main limitations of this study are its retrospective design and absence of routine surveillance in outpatients. Except CMV, surveillance for viruses was performed only in clinical suspicion, so the frequency of these infections might have been underestimated. In conclusion, CMV and BK virus infections were found to be significantly low in MRD-HSCT in this study. MUD and haplo-HSCT are comparable with each other in the setting of all viral infections, which is not stated in previous studies. Despite antiviral prophylaxis and treatments, post-transplant viral infections are associated with reduced overall survival and increased hospitalization, but these complications are significantly preventable with good follow-up and preemptive treatment without any clinical disease. For this reason, especially in countries where it takes a long time to find suitable donors, viral diseases should not interfere with the decision of haplo-HSCT considering the time spent on the patient. A larger study group and prospective studies are needed to confirm this observation. In these patients with post-transplant viral disease, the potential widespread application of virus-specific T lymphocyte therapy may likely reduce long-term morbidity and mortality.

Of the children with severe acute GVHD, 88.4% developed at least one viral infection and 60.5% developed multiple viral infections. Mild-moderate chronic GVHD was observed in seven patients, six of them had one viral infection, and two of them had multiple viral infections.

Most of the viral reactivations/clinical infections (80.6%) occurred during the first 3 months post-HSCT (Table 3). Recipients of MUD1, MUD2 grafts, and recipients of haploidentical donor grafts seemed to have a higher incidence of multiple viral infections than those of MRD grafts (16/40 [42.5%]-11/29 [37.9%] and 10/31 [32.3%] vs 6/71 [8.45%], P < .0001). We found an increased risk of having multiple viral infection among those patients who have a total lymphocyte count<1000/mm 3 at day +100 (32% vs 18%, P = .035).
