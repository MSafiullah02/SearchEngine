            "text": "Gaseous disinfection is a procedure commonly used to inactivate microbes in biotechnological manufacturing facilities and laboratories. The disinfectants should be effective against all relevant microbial agents; however, information supplied by disinfectant manufacturers does not necessarily cover targeted microbes. This lack of information about relevant targets has prompted a variety of past investigations on disinfectant effectiveness, which were typically performed directly in the laboratory environment [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The resulting data was rather limited, as the experimental setup did not allow to obtain sequential samples at different times during the inactivation run (kinetic samples) for an assessment of virus inactivation, as requested by regulatory guidance [6], [7]. Additionally, a complete laboratory shutdown was required, which is costly and time consuming. These constraints were circumvented by performing small-scale evaluations using biosafety class III cabinets that were connected to vapor generators [8], [9]. Biosafety class III cabinets however, are only rarely available. As an alternative and more practical approach we established a robust, simple and cost-effective down-scaled investigation procedure, which simulates the practical conditions around biotechnology applications, i.e. in manufacturing facilities as well as laboratory units that allows for kinetic investigation of gaseous disinfectant procedures. Using a custom made Dry Fog box and currently available carrier tests [10], the virus inactivation capacity of the Minncare\n\u00ae Dry Fog decontamination system that uses a mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (PAA/HP) was investigated with a panel of viruses, including the lipid-enveloped viruses bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and influenza A and B viruses, as well as the non-lipid-enveloped respiratory enteric orphan virus type III (Reo III) and the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM).",

A Minntech\u00ae Dry Fog unit (Cantel Medical Corp./Mar Cor, Little Falls, NJ), was connected to the diffusion head via a magnetic valve for regulation of 10% aqueous Minncare\n\u00ae Cold Sterilant, containing peroxyacetic acid (PAA, 4.5%) and hydrogen peroxide (HP, 22.0%), that was released into the box. PAA/HP solution was applied in four different run designs (I\u2013IV), at increasing concentrations ranging from 0.4 mL/m3 (run design I) to 2.9 mL/m3 (run design IV). PAA/HP solution concentrations were calculated according to the Excel spreadsheet \u201cMinncare DRY FOG Calculations\u201d provided by Minncare\u00ae. During the first 59 min of run design II (0.8 mL PAA/HP solution/m3) re-fogging was performed as soon as the rH decreased by 5%. Kinetic samples were drawn after 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 59 min by pulling the sample holder out of the Dry Fog box, vortexing the metal carriers at 600 rpm for 30 s in plastic tubes containing sterile glass beads (\u00d8 0.5 mm) and 1 mL of appropriate cell culture medium, similar to Doerrbecker et al. [11]. For the non-lipid enveloped viruses additional samples were drawn after 114 min and 174 min. The supernatant was immediately used for TCID50 titration.",

In contrast, BVDV was inactivated at the same disinfectant concentration after 59 min treatment by merely 1.6 log10 (Table 1A, Fig. 2\nA). Doubling the amount of PAA/HP solution (0.8 mL/m3, run design II) resulted in inactivation of BVDV by 2.6 log10 after the total inactivation time of 59 min (Table 1A, Fig. 2A). Similar inactivation kinetics were found for Reo III, of which 1.9 log10 virus infectivity were inactivated after 59 min treatment with run design I and 1.6 log10 at the higher disinfectant concentration (run design II; Table 1B, Fig. 2B). After the complete inactivation period of 174 min Reo III was inactivated by 2.3 log10 in run design I and 2.1 log10 in run design II, respectively (Table 1B, Fig. 2B). MVM was only inactivated by 1.1 log10 at the low PAA/HP solution amount in run design I after 174 min (Table 1B, Fig. 2C). Application of a PAA/HP solution amount of 0.8 mL/m3 including repeated re-fogging to maintain a nearly constant PAA/HP concentration during the first 59 min treatment showed inactivation of 1.6 log10 MVM (Fig. 2C).

Data on virus inactivation provided by the manufacturer show effective inactivation of poliovirus, human coronavirus and human immunodeficiency virus by use of suspension tests only [17], which are however not meaningful regarding the application of dry fog, underlining the requirement for the conduct of relevant disinfectant efficacy studies. We found that already lower PAA/HP concentrations (run design I) were sufficient for inactivation of influenza viruses, but MVM could be only partially inactivated during run design III; inactivation to below the detection limit (i.e. > 4.6 log10) required a 174 min treatment and elevated PAA/HP solution concentration (run design IV: 2.9 mL/m3). If MVM was the target virus, i.e. after contamination of a biotechnology facility with specifically this virus [12], an extended disinfection period would have to be considered. An earlier investigation had shown inactivation of Reo III and MVM to below the detection limit after 60 min exposure time, applying only 2 mL/m3 PAA/HP solution of roughly a 25% higher concentration [1]. These data are generally comparable to our findings, however a clear comparison is not possible as drawing of kinetic samples was not feasible within the limitations of the whole laboratory fogging set-up chosen, and consequently safety margins of the inactivation approach could not be assessed.",
