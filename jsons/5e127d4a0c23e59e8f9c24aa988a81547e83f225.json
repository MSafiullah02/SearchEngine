These include applications in treating antibiotic-resistant organisms, viruses, cancers and to prevent burn scarring. The major theoretical justification for reusing approved drugs is that they have known modes of action and controllable side effects. Coadministering antibiotics with inhibitors of bacterial toxins or enzymes that mediate multidrug resistance can greatly enhance their activity.

This should lead to enhanced activity and lower the chances for development of resistance. 60 Reverting to older antibiotics can, in some cases, overcome antibiotic resistance. For example, TB strains resistant to currently used drug combinations are found in all parts of the world. One of the most useful TB drugs, isoniazid, inhibits the enzyme InhA, blocking the synthesis of the mycolic acids that make up the cell wall of the mycobacterium. Much of the resistance to isoniazid, a prodrug, comes from mutations in the bacterial enzymes required to activate it. It has recently been found that an older natural product antibiotic, pyridomycin, discovered in the 1950s, inhibits InhA directly. Thus it can be used to treat infections with resistant TB strains that survive by their lack of ability to activate isoniazid. 61 Understanding this mechanism of action may also advance the use of pyridomycin in conjunction with other drugs. 62", "cite_spans": [{"start": 618, "end": 620, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1353, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "|"}, {"text": "The era of antibiotic resistance has also brought a new interest in combining older antibiotics with compounds that can enhance their activity. 63 Many compounds have been developed to specifically block bacterial enzymes that mediate resistance. 64 Combining penicillin derivatives with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors can overcome bacterial resistance in many cases. 19 For example, one can pair piperacillin with tazobactam, a competitive inhibitor of \u03b2lactamases that protects the paired antibiotic from degradation. The mechanisms of \u03b2-lactamases and their respective inhibitors that have been successfully combined with antibiotics are discussed in several comprehensive reviews. 65, 66 While combination therapy has advantages, the rapid rise of resistance mutations in bacteria 67 can complicate the choice of combinations to yield the best synergy among treatments. 68 Determining the most effective adjuvants to complement antibiotics to better treat resistant bacteria should be aided by a new \"antibiotic resistance platform\" (ARP). The ARP is an array of transformed Escherichia coli that expresses one of greater than 40 different known antibiotic resistance genes.
