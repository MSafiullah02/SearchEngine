            "text": "Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe, contagious haemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate ranging from 3 to 30 %. It is caused by an RNA virus, belonging to the Nairovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. The principal mode of transmission of Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) to humans is through an infected Hyalomma tick bite or through contact with blood, tissues or bodily fluids of another infected animal. Agricultural workers, shepherds, veterinarians, picnickers and the people involved in outdoor sports are at greater risk in endemic regions, such as Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries. Human-to-human transmission may occur through percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood, tissues or other bodily fluids from infected persons [1, 2]. Nosocomial transmission is also possible in a similar way and poses a threat for healthcare workers (HCWs). Although the number of cases diagnosed as CCHF has been decreasing over the years, Turkey has encountered one of the largest epidemics in the world since the detection of the first case in 2002 [3]. Only a few cases of nosocomial transmission of CCHF to healthcare workers have been reported till date [4]. Most of these nosocomial cases bear histories of percutaneous injuries or contact with contaminated blood without adequate barrier precautions. Here, we report nosocomial cases of CCHF from visitors and healthcare workers even in the absence of a percutaneous injury or contact with contaminated body fluid. The cases were diagnosed at two different hospitals located in different cities. Nosocomial clustering of the CCHF cases was perceived during personal communications between the doctors.",

Visitors are restricted, but this is not always possible with the patients having a bad prognosis. If visitors are allowed, they are informed about the transmission risks of CCHF, and they have to use personal protective equipment. In addition to these, each case has to be notified immediately to the local health authority by a web-based system.

She was enquired regarding her appropriate and consistent use of personal protective equipment while entering the patient room, any events of splashing of patient\u2019s bodily fluids, and was checked for the presence of punctures on her hands, etc. A similar detailed history was also obtained from the doctor. The doctor and the nurse had been in the patient room without mask for a very short time. The visitors were also enquired regarding their place of living, possibility of contact with ticks, animal holdings, their profession and events of close contact with the index case or any known CCHF case outside the hospital. Case 1 was living in a different city. Both of the visitors had no contact with the index case out of the hospital. We did not get any data about transmission of CCHF out of the hospital. The second case had been in the patient\u2019s room for ~10 min twice. Both of the visitors declared that they had used masks, gowns and gloves. Our clinic nurses confirmed their declaration. We could not investigate the environmental samples, since the symptoms in the secondary cases appeared 4\u20135 days after the death of the index case.

Our index patient was intubated and on mechanical ventilation when the cases were encountered. All these cases suggest the droplet or airborne transmission of CCHF virus in some cases. We could not measure the viral load in the index patient, but during the terminal stages, severe patients might become more infectious [9].
