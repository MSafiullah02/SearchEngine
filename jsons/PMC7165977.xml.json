            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is mainly characterized by reproductive disturbances in sows and respiratory distress in young pigs. In Japan, PRRS virus (PRRSV) was first isolated from fattening pigs and stillborn pigs in 1993 (Shimizu et al., 1994). The antigenicity of the Japanese isolates was more closely related to that of the American\u2010type virus than to that of the European\u2010type virus (Murakami et al., 1994). PRRSV is thought to be a major primary pathogen and increase severity of secondary infections related to porcine respiratory disease complex. Concurrent infection with PRRSV and porcine respiratory coronavirus or swine influenza virus (Van Reeth et al., 1996), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 1999) or Streptococcus suis (Galina et al., 1994) causes more severe disease than PRRSV alone. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection caused nervous disorders, mortality and respiratory disease in pigs. Dual infection with PRV plus bacteria induced severe pneumonia in pigs (Fuentes and Pijoan, 1987; Iglesias et al., 1992a; Sakano et al., 1993; Shibata et al., 1998). In swine farms, pigs are confronted with several infectious agents, especially after weaning, and infections of Japanese pigs with PRRSV and PRV are common shortly after the grouping of pigs in intensive fattening units. Combined infections with both viruses likely take place at that stage, but the clinical effects of dual infection with PRRSV and PRV have not been demonstrated. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and pathological effects of dual infection with these viruses in young pigs, with that of a single infection with PRRSV or PRV.",

            "text": "Under experimental condition, respiratory clinical signs in pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV alone were not observed and pulmonary gross lesions have usually been very mild (Carvalho et al., 1997; Solano et al., 1997). Infection with the E4 strain or other Japanese isolates alone did not cause pigs to develop respiratory clinical signs and visible pneumonia as reported in previous studies (Hirose et al., 1995). Generally, in field conditions, pigs coinfected with PRRSV and other organisms show clinical symptoms. Infection by the American PRRSV strain, ATCC VR\u20102385, induced gross lesions characterized by lungs that were mottled tan or diffusely tan, were firmer and heavier than normal lungs, and failed to collapse (Thacker et al., 1999). The VR\u20102385 strain was classified as a high virulence strain (Halbur et al., 1996), and should be more virulent than the strain used in the present study. The lung lesions observed in the PRRSV\u2013PRV group were similar to that introduced by the VR\u20102385 strain. On the other hand, some PRV strains induce pulmonary lesions in addition to lesions in the central nervous system, and cause mild respiratory disease to develop in pigs. However, the Yamagata S\u201081 strain used in the present study introduced no pneumonic lesions in pigs inoculated intranasally (Shibata et al., 1998). In the present study, gross lung lesions were also not observed in the PRV group. Generally, characteristic lung lesions induced by PRRSV infections is proliferative interstitial pneumonia, and that by PRV infection consist of necrotic bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis (Kluge et al., 1999). The prominent lung lesion in the PRRSV\u2013PRV group was proliferative interstitial pneumonia. Furthermore, PRRSV was isolated from the lungs of the inoculated pigs; however, PRV was not isolated from the lungs in any group on day 21. These findings support the hypothesis that the lung lesions observed in the PRRSV\u2013PRV group may be induced by PRRSV infection. Further studies using a larger number of pigs would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",

Furthermore, PRV causes immunosuppression by altering the function and survival of lymphocytes (Chinsakchai et al., 1990). Respiratory defence mechanisms may be temporarily impaired as a result of PRV infection, and development of pneumonia induced by PRRSV may be promoted because of impaired and/or delayed viral clearance.",
