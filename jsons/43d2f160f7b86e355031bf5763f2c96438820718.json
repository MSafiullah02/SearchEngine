The results revealed that the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon positon have widely usage in the codon of UL16 gene of DPV.

The phylogenetic analysis suggested that DPV was evolutionarily closer to herpesviruses which further clustered into Alphaherpesvirinae. Furthermore the ORF of DPV UL16 gene has sequential rare codons. There were 21 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with Escherichia coli, 19 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with yeast, and 20 between DPV and Human.

Previous research have been showed that codon usage bias may be very complicated and associated with various biological factors, such as gene expression level [3] , gene length [4] , gene translation initiation signal [5] , protein amino acid composition [6] , protein structure [7] , tRNA abundance [8, 9] , mutation frequency and patterns [6, 10] , GC composition [11, 12] , and environmental factors [13] . For a number of different organisms, it was suggested that codon usage is best explained by selection for tRNA abundance, gene expression levels, and translational optimization [14] . Recently, it was also suggested that codon usage is related to gene function [15, 16] and the the evolutionary history of an organism in metazoan genomes [17] . Codon usage bias can reveal information about the molecular evolution of individual genes and provide data to train genome-specific gene recognition algorithms which recognize protein coding regions in uncharacterized genomic DNA.

The frequencies with which different codons are used vary significantly between organisms and between proteins within the same organism [31] . In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of codon usage including ENC, CAI value, GC content and the RSCU values of the DPV UL16 gene was performed by using EMBOSS programs and CodonW, and these values were subsequently compared with those of the 22 reference herpesvirus species. These datas of synonymous codon usage bias showed certain disparity of each herpesvirus from the different organisms with the result revealing that: (1) the DPV UL16 gene and its 22 reference herpesviruses adopt relatively similar codon usage patterns, although the DPV UL16 gene shows a few differences of codon usage bias with its reference herpesvirus species; and (2) the DPV UL16 gene prefers to use the codons with A and T at the 3rd codon position. From the table 1, twenty-six synonymous codons strong bias toward A-and T-ended at the third codon position were used. The DPV UL16 gene is an AT-rich gene. At the same time, random mutations increase the population of AT rather than CG as a result, undergo spontaneous deaminations [32] . So it is reasonable that codons ending in A and/or T are predominant in the gene. The ENC value and GC 3S content, two important codon usage indices, have been widely used to explore the codon usage variation among different genes [33] [34] [35] . Values of ENC range From 20(when only one codon is used per amino acid) to 61(when all synonyms are used with equal frequency). The ENC values of herpesvirus UL16 genes are dramatically different (from 28.504 to 60.115 shown in table 2) but mostly the codon usage bias is lower stronger. The ENC value of DPV UL16 gene is high (ENC>50), so that the codon usage bias is low stronger. If G+C compositional constraint influences the codon usage, then the GC 3S and ENC correlated spots would lie on the expected curve [30] . If a gene is subject to selection for translationally optimal codons, it will lie considerably below the expected curve [36] . In Fig.1 , a large number of points do not follow the theoretical curve suggesting that other factors other than gene composition contribute to the codon usage pattern in the reference herpesviruses, which maybe mutational bias and natural selection, such as translational selection, the tRNA abundance, leading to the codon usage variation among genes in different organisms. Comparative analysis of UL16 genes in DPV and the reference herpesviruses indicated that synonymous codon usage in these genes is phylogenetically conserved. Datas in table 2 show that the UL16 genes in DPV, MeHV-1, GaHV-2 and GaHV-3, whose natural host is avian, have a stronger correlation than the UL16 genes of herpesviruses with other hosts. In the table 3, the CAI value of DPV UL16 gene is 0.600, which is a little slight higher. The CAI value is much closer to 1, the codon usage is a little stronger and the gene expressing level is much higher. We can infer UL16 gene is highly expressed gene in DPV genome. Simultaneously, the phylogenetic tree analysis based on the UL16 gene products revealed that UL16 protein of the DPV CHv strain and some avian herpesviruses such as MeHV-1, GaHV-2 and GaHV-3, were clustered within a monophyletic clade and grouped within Alphaherpesvirinae. We speculate that the codon usage bias of DPV UL16 gene has a very close relation with its gene function and gene type. DPV UL16 gene is similar to the UL16 gene function of the herpesviruses. Studies on the HHV-1 have well documented that the tegument UL16 protein is not required for viral replication in cell culture and its function may be in viral DNA packaging, virion assembly, budding, and egress by providing an interaction with the membrane-bound UL11 protein and the UL21 protein [26, [37] [38] [39] . In the absence of murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 (MuHV-4) ORF33 (UL16 homologue), immature virions were restrained in a state interacting with actin and glycoproteins gB and failed release of infectious virions [40] . Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis indicated that the DPV UL16 protein has higher similarity with these homologues, and may also play a similar role to that of HHV-1 in the viral DNA packaging, virion assembly, budding, and egress.
