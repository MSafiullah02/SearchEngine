The detection of both antigens and antibodies in SARS-CoV from human specimens with suspected SARS plays an important role in preventing infection. We developed a novel rapid immunochromatographic test (RICT) based on the sandwich format enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with an all-in-one device for detecting the native nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) of SARS-CoV using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which we produced by immunizing recombinant N-Ag to mice. RICT is a qualitative assay for respiratory aspirates and serum specimens. With this assay, a positive result can be judged subjectively by the appearance of a blue line on the device 15 min after the sample is applied. RICT with several pairs of MoAbs showed a high sensitivity for the detection of recombinant N-Ag as well as viral N-Ag of SARS-CoV. rSN122 and rSN21-2 were the best MoAbs for immobilized antibody and enzyme labeling, respectively. With regard to analytical sensitivity, RICT detected N-Ag at 31 pg/mL for recombinant N-Ag, and at 1.99 \u00c2 10 2 TCID 50 /mL for SARS-CoV. The specificity of RICT was 100% when 150 human sera and 50 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NSPs) were used.
