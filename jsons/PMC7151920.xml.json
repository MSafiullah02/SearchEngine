Both stroke volume and cardiac output are lower than in similar-sized mammals. Blood volume is unusually low, and compliance of the vascular system is also low. The peculiar vascular anatomy\u2014with narrow, rigid veins with low compliance in the legs and large, compliant veins in the neck region\u2014gives rise to an interesting and nonintuitive physiologic phenomenon.6 When the head of the anesthetized giraffe is lowered, blood pressure at head-level briefly spikes, before returning to much lower values. The lowering of the blood pressure coincides with pooling of blood in the compliant jugular veins, giving rise to a decreased cardiac preload and consequently lower systemic blood pressure (Frank-Starling mechanism). As a consequence of this mechanism, the arterial pressure at head level is maintained at or near 100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), and the central blood pressure is directly proportional to the position of the head relative to the heart. Because of the high arterial pressures and the hydrostatic pressure, the arterial pressure in the lower leg may exceed 450 mm Hg. Edema in this region is prevented through a gravity-suit-like fascia and skin, prominent lymphatics, and well-developed valves in veins and lymphatics, as well as an abrupt narrowing of the arterial lumen at the level of the elbow or stifle.",

The opioids, however, may induce excitation and hyperthermia if underdosed and result in hypoventilation when used in high dosages. A compromise, which involves incorporating opioids, ketamine, and \u03b12-agonists in one protocol, appears to be the best solution so far.11, 24 Refer to Table 61-1 for suggested protocols.",

The key to success is careful planning and the availability of trained personnel and necessary equipment. The ideal induction occurs in a well-designed restraint device, which may be opened fully once the animal is recumbent. The second-best solution is a chute-system, where a halter may be placed on the sedated giraffe prior to induction, which will allow control of the head via a rope and pulley. The third-best option is to place a loop of thick rope around the base of the neck of the sedated animal and \u201cwalk\u201d the animal to an open area with no obstacles, where it is made to walk in circles, with one to three handlers holding the rope. The animal is then tripped with another rope while still awake enough to maintain some control of the head during the fall. If neither of these options are available, the animal may be allowed to become recumbent in a padded stall or at least in an area without major obstacles. In either case, it is crucial to gain control of the animal's head as soon as it becomes recumbent, as most injuries occur when the heavily sedated giraffe attempts to stand and falls again.",

The frequent early reports of regurgitation in okapis sedated with Immobilon (etorphine and acepromazine) was attributed to etorphine but likely largely was a reaction to acepromazine, which this author considers contraindicated in okapis. In animals fed mainly hay and pelleted feed, withholding food and water for 12 hours prior to a planned procedure is sufficient, but in animals eating large amounts of fresh browse, a 24-hour period is advisable. To minimize pulmonary compromise and ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, a sternal position is preferable, when feasible, but giraffes generally do well in lateral recumbency for shorter periods. To reduce the risk of regurgitation and to stabilize blood pressure (see Unique Physiology section), the head should be elevated 80 to 150 cm above heart level. The neck should be kept as straight as possible, and placement of a padded board or ladder under the shoulder and onto bales of straw or similar material works well for this purpose.",

The approach currently employed by most successful capture crews relies on massive dosing with potent opioids (etorphine, carfentanil, thiafentanil, or a combination) to reduce the time from darting to recumbency and subsequent skilled handling of the awake, but physically restrained, animal.63 The giraffe is darted from the ground or, more commonly, from a helicopter, and typically the animal goes down within minutes, although some animals need to be cast with ropes. Soon after the giraffe becomes recumbent, it is blindfolded, ears plugged, and haltered and reversal agents are administered. Once the animal stands again after a few minutes, it is led with ropes into an open trailer used to be transported to a larger contained trailer that accommodates several animals. Refer to Table 61-1 for doses. Other methods incorporating ketamine, with or without medetomidine, to reduce the opioid dosage result in longer induction times but more controlled immobilization.8, 11 Recently, mass capture using a funnel system has been employed successfully for translocations.",

Many animals died without any history of illness, others after a mild or short-term illness or stressful incident. Emaciation with serous atrophy of fat is the key pathologic finding, often accompanied by pulmonary edema, petechial hemorrhages, intestinal ulceration, and myocardial degeneration.13 Essentially, this \u201csyndrome\u201d appears to be simply caused by a negative energy balance, either from insufficient nutrition13 or poor dental health,18 and the \u201clast straw\u201d or event triggering death may be hypothermia or stress.34, 54 Similar pathologic findings are observed in winter in free-ranging giraffes at the southern margin of their distribution and are interpreted as starvation. A similar phenomenon appears to exist in the okapi, and emaciation with serous atrophy of fat was noted in 17 of 134 okapi postmortem reports reviewed.17\n",
