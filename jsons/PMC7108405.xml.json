            "text": "Picornaviruses are the most common cause of viral illness worldwide (Rotbart and Hayden, 2000). Rhinoviruses (HRVs; previously called coryzaviruses, ECHO 28-rhinovirus-coryzaviruses (ERCs), muriviruses, enterovirus-like viruses, nasal secretion agents and Salisbury strains (Ketler et al., 1962, Jackson and Dowling, 1959, Andrewes, 1966, Hamre, 1967, Tyrrell and Parsons, 1960)) are the most common cause of acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) and upper respiratory tract (URT) infections, traditionally defined as \u2018common colds\u2019. ARTI is the leading cause of morbidity in children under 5 years (Bryce et al., 2005). No symptoms are pathognomonic for HRV infection (Phillips et al., 1968, Baer et al., 2007, van den Hoogen et al., 2003) so it devolves to the diagnostic laboratory to confirm the presence of HRVs (Barrett et al., 2006). Disappointingly, routine screening for HRV strains occurs infrequently because (i) testing is not always available (ii), HRV infection is often considered innocuous and (iii) because there are no treatments available. At the end of the 20th century, many aspects of HRV epidemiology, immunobiology, strain characterization and clinical impact remained poorly addressed (Couch, 1984, Monto et al., 1987). Nonetheless, HRVs are the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics to treat respiratory illness; even more so than bacterial infections (Rotbart and Hayden, 2000) and related costs exceed USD10 billion annually (Bertino, 2002). HRVs are also the most commonly identified pathogens associated with expiratory wheezing exacerbations, another burden on healthcare resources at many levels (Nyquist et al., 1998, Papadopoulos et al., 2002a, Jacques et al., 2006, Rotbart and Hayden, 2000, Monto, 2002, Jartti et al., 2004b).",

The legion of antigenically distinct HRV strains has stymied the search for answers to epidemiology-related questions for decades (Andrewes, 1964) and as a result, HRVs are frequently dismissed as a single group of subtle variants.",

With the application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to HRV screening, it seemed possible to make great advances in our understanding of HRV infection; prior to this, detection of HRVs depended on subjective and insensitive methods ranging from deliberate human infection to cell or organ culture and serology. PCR is the best tool we currently have for better characterizing HRVs, but only when it is applied carefully and with a full understanding of its limitations (2007). Careful epidemiology plays a pivotal role in our understanding of the HRVs. Clinical follow-up of all HRV PCR positives, including in asymptomatic individuals or in control groups without the relevant respiratory symptoms, must occur hand-in-hand with regular and frequent sampling; an expensive undertaking.",

The family Picornaviridae (\u2018pico\u2019 = Spanish for small, \u2018rna\u2019 = ribonucleic acid genome) currently comprises nine genera including Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. Within each of the two current species (Human rhinovirus A, 75 strains and Human rhinovirus B, 25 strains), HRV strains exhibit >70% amino acid identity and similar antiviral susceptibility patterns although recent studies indicate that some strains may not be distinct enough to deserve a unique name (Ledford et al., 2004). In 2004 a proposal was set before the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to merge the genera Rhinovirus and Enterovirus into a single genus, Enterovirus, with species remaining intact and under the banner of a new virus order, Picornavirales (Le Gall et al., 2008). The issue of merging the genera has been one of contention for decades (Rosen, 1965, Skern et al., 1985, Stanway et al., 1984).",

In fact, HRV strains were suggested to be under \u2018purifying\u2019 pressure driving minimal change over time, apart from variation at sites of immune activity. Recently, an HRV has been described which may have resulted from a recombination event between the P3 region of two HRV A strains (Tapparel et al., 2008). Nonetheless, the 5\u2019UTR from HRV strains identified decades earlier, retains the same conserved sections (Andeweg et al., 1999), making it a good region for molecular typing of HRV strains (Lee et al., 2007). In our hands, it has proven less useful for clearly assigning HEV strains to their current species (Fig. 3\n). In Brisbane, we have identified contemporary variants of HRV strains first classified in 1967, that retained 100% amino acid and >90% nucleotide identity with their elder namesakes (1B region; data derived from Arden et al. (2006)).",

Many studies have detected some strains more or less frequently (Table 2\n) but they do not seek all likely microbial causes or even span sufficient time to encompass all possible HRV strains. Andries et al. suggested that antiviral group B strains (HRV A) were over-represented among symptomatic respiratory infections (SRIs) ascribing a more frequent role in disease to these strains but this could also be attributed to the greater number of strains in this group. A more practical finding was that less HRV-39 (HRV A) than HRV-14 (HRV B) was required to infect antibody-free adult volunteers, the latter also producing colds of milder severity (Hendley et al., 1972). In 2006, a birth cohort study noted that infants who wheezed with infection by one HRV strain did not always wheeze with a second or third HRV infection (Kusel et al., 2006) suggesting some strains may be more \u2018asthmagenic\u2019 (Yoo et al., 2007).",

Early in vitro isolation methods employed an interference test to determine successful isolation; cultures suspected of infection with an HRV prevented infection by another, readily titratable virus (Andrewes, 1966). Later, Price (1956; the JH strain) and then Pelon et al. (1957; 2060 strain) developed improved culture systems that permitted viral replication to be more easily identified (Pelon et al., 1957, Price, 1956). These strains were initially classified as echoviruses (ECHO 28; later HRV-1) (Pelon, 1961). At the same time, propagation of the HGP (HRV-2) strain resulted from using increased acidity, lowered cultivation temperatures and constant motion (rotation) (Tyrrell et al., 1960, Parsons and Tyrrell, 1961). Despite the challenges (Mogabgab and Pelon, 1957), virus isolation is a more sensitive indicator of infection than an antibody rise in paired sera (Hendley et al., 1972).",

It is becoming commonplace to find HRVs as the predominant virus in ARTI cases (Aberle et al., 2005, Versteegh et al., 2005, Hutchinson et al., 2007). No PCR assays have been completely validated against all picornavirus strains using clinical material, a pedantic but nonetheless necessary process, yet many successfully detect the currently circulating HRV strains at levels as low as 102\n TCID50/sample. This amount is commonly shed during experimental inoculation studies (Arruda and Hayden, 1993, Lu et al., 2008). Because HRV strains are being detected beyond their commonly understood symptomatic context (Johnston et al., 1993b, Suvilehto et al., 2006) it is important to define a qualitative or quantitative correlation between viral nucleic acid detection and the presence of infectious virus at the sampling site, a problem when using PCR to study respiratory viruses (Mackay et al., 2007). Today, the most commonly employed oligonucleotides comprising the \u2018Gama assay\u2019 (OL26 and OL27, (Gama et al., 1988)), remain at the forefront of detecting respiratory picornaviruses (Torgersen et al., 1989, Gern et al., 2000, Spence et al., 2007, Winther et al., 2007, Arruda and Hayden, 1993, Xatzipsalti et al., 2005, Papadopoulos et al., 1999a, Papadopoulos et al., 1999b, Khetsuriani et al., 2007, Arruda et al., 1997, Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1997, Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1998, Johnston et al., 1993b, Blomqvist et al., 1999, Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2002, Kusel et al., 2006, Seemungal et al., 2001). However, subtle repositioning of these primers or changes to the method of employing them (Ireland et al., 1993, Collinson et al., 1996, Deffernez et al., 2004, Jartti et al., 2004b) may be detrimental to assay performance, suggested by predicted hybridisation mismatches and unusually reduced detection frequencies. Other oligonucleotides used in HRV studies include (Hayden et al., 2003, Wright et al., 2007, Steininger et al., 2001, Billaud et al., 2003, Hyypi\u00e4 et al., 1989, Freymuth et al., 2000, Halonen et al., 1995, Blomqvist et al., 1999, Blomqvist et al., 2002, Vesa et al., 2001, Coiras et al., 2004). In common with the Gama assay, some diagnostic oligonucleotides used for HRV PCR-based studies share identity with HEV sequences and vice versa (Leparc et al., 1994, Lina et al., 1996). In our hands, the Lu assay (Lu et al., 2008) functions as a suitable real-time PCR alternative and is useful for epidemiology studies seeking to better represent respiratory picornavirus prevalence. The use of oligoprobes increases amplicon detection sensitivity and specificity, identifying 100-fold fewer TCID50/mL or 10-fold fewer genome copies, than agarose gel detection of amplicon (Johnston et al., 1993b, Andr\u00e9oletti et al., 2000, Lu et al., 2008).",

            "text": "When they are included in the testing menu, HRV detections can raise the frequency of pathogen detection above one per sample (Brunstein et al., 2008). Early HRV studies found that HRV strains were frequent contributors to co-infections and concluded this was evidence for a minor role in serious respiratory illness (Stott et al., 1969). More likely this reflected the insensitivity of the culture methods used which simply failed to propagate many HRV strains. Today, half of all HRV detections can be found concurrently with another virus, on the surface, a significant fraction, and yet 80% or more of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), HEV and influenzavirus (IFV) detections and 71% of human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 detections can be found in the company of another virus (Richard et al., 2008). Considering their ubiquity, it is interesting that relatively low numbers of concurrent detections of other respiratory viruses occur with HRV strains (Mackay, 2007, Lambert et al., 2007), supporting the concept that HRVs have a direct role in the clinical outcome of their infection (Miller et al., 2007). In fact, HRV strains are co-detected with other pathogens in reproducible, but clinically undefined, patterns (Brunstein et al., 2008). The HRV partnership with host immunity may be a mutualistic one, inadvertently imparting an advantage to the host by protecting against more cytopathic respiratory viral pathogens while the host provides a vessel for HRV replication and transmission.",

Similar technology also provides a sensitive, 20-target, 2-step RT-PCR-based assay (Mahony et al., 2007). A novel approach to amplicon detection entitled \u2018MassTag\u2019 (USD10-15 per sample) can discriminate 20 viral PCR products (Briese et al., 2005) using oligonucleotides tagged with a unique compound that is released via a photolabile link (QIAGEN). The MassTag approach has successfully identified novel HRV sequences (Renwick et al., 2007, Lamson et al., 2006). Microarrays can detect thousands of viral targets (USD30-300 per sample) but are not sensitive enough to avoid a pre-hybridisation PCR amplification when using clinical specimens. At their most robust, microarrays, like PCR, rely on the existence of conserved regions of sequence to detect unknown viruses and they have succeeded in detecting previously unknown HRV strains (Wang et al., 2002). Rapid protein- or virion-based assays are not (yet) adequately sensitive (Ostroff et al., 2001, Shanmukh et al., 2006).",

Among healthy adults, this length of excretion is significant, however cultivation failure from intermediate samples with lower viral loads and heterotypic cross-reactivity which influences the strain typing system cannot be excluded. Viral RNA detection, usually conducted in the absence of any strain typing, has been suggested to occur days before to five or more weeks after symptoms commence or cease, respectively (Winther et al., 2006, Jartti et al., 2004a, Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 2005). The implication is that samples taken only during an SRI could be HRV-negative while sampling outside this period may detect the virus in the absence of symptoms (Winther et al., 2006). Unfortunately, few data are available to address this since clinical follow-up is rare (Suvilehto et al., 2006). When parents maintained a daily symptom diary, 81% of respiratory picornvirus RT-PCR positives were associated with illness while 19% were not, however \u2018asymptomatic\u2019 periods may also have been associated with underreporting of true SRIs (Winther et al., 2006).

One must therefore be cautious when describing persistent HRV infections (Kling et al., 2005) in the absence of strain typing investigations if the implication is that persistence is a feature of individual HRV strains. Virus shedding normally ceases within days (Gern et al., 2000). It is likely that any plan to link HRV positivity with asymptomatic carriage in otherwise healthy individuals will require carefully constructed aims, regular and frequent sampling and a clinical scoring system capable of determining a real asymptomatic state. The current data indicate that truly chronic shedding (>8 months) of a single HRV strain is limited to those individuals with underlying immunosuppression or immune dysfunction (Kaiser et al., 2006).",

Point inoculation of the conjunctival sac, in the absence of neutralizing antibody (\u22641:2), results in active infection of the nasal mucosa after virus is carried through the nasolacrimal duct (Winther et al., 1986). In these and other experimental inoculation studies virus is commonly delivered by aerosol or intranasal instillation of 0.25\u20135 mL of virus suspension (Douglas et al., 1966b, Winther et al., 1986, Hendley et al., 1972, Turner et al., 1998, D\u2019Alessio et al., 1984, Cate et al., 1965, Mallia et al., 2006). Nasopharyngeal washes yield better viral isolation rates than either nasal or pharyngeal swabs, but the convenience of swabs has meant their use is more widespread (Cate et al., 1964, Gwaltney et al., 1966, Peltola et al., 2008) especially now that the presence of viable HRV is not necessary for virus identification.",

This feature of early HRV epidemiology has been largely demystified today with our current knowledge of 100+ strains, a grasp of the immunology involved, the identification of asymptomatic infections and a vastly improved diagnostic sensitivity. In the past, household cross-infection, determined by SRI, was low; about five exposures to infected members required for infection (Lidwell and Sommerville, 1951) despite viral loads in nasal washings peaking at 1.6 \u00d7 105\n TCID50/mL (Douglas et al., 1966b). Experimental transmission was also reportedly inefficient (D\u2019Alessio et al., 1984). In contrast, \u2018naturally\u2019 close-quartered military populations, interacting over 1\u20134 weeks experienced rapid spread of HRV strains to >50% of the group (Rosenbaum et al., 1971). The use of PCR recently clarified this discrepancy confirming that frequent transmission in families is more common than culture-based studies identified, often resulting in asymptomatic infection among older siblings and parents (Peltola et al., 2008).",

Colds are the principal outcome attributed to HRV infection but there is no obvious pattern to the symptoms reported (Lidwell and Sommerville, 1951, Bloom et al., 1963, Gern et al., 2000). More than 80% of common colds have been temporally associated with the detection of respiratory picornaviruses, of which the majority are HRVs (Andrewes, 1964, Arruda et al., 1997). However, other respiratory viruses are also associated with an URT syndrome of illness (Johnson et al., 1964) including the HCoVs (around 8% of detections), IFVs (5\u201315%), HRSV and the human adenoviruses (Andrewes, 1964, Andrewes, 1966, Pizzichini et al., 1998, Eccles, 2007). HRV strains, detected using PCR of specimens from children followed over the first year of life, increase the risk of URT illness more than the presence of HRSV (Kusel et al., 2006). Symptoms, which develop within days (Holmes et al., 1976), can include sneezing, nasal discharge (rhinorrhoea), nasal congestion/blockage, sore or irritated throat, headache, cough, a feeling of fever or \u2018chilliness\u2019, headache, and malaise (Winther et al., 2006, Rosenbaum et al., 1971). Hoarseness, loss of taste and smell, body aches and pains, mild burning of the eyes and a feeling of pressure in the ears or sinuses due to obstruction and/or mucosal swelling may also occur. Anorexia, loose bowels and neutrophilia have been noted among experimentally infected adult volunteers (Cate et al., 1964, Cate et al., 1965, Douglas et al., 1966b). Early and elevated viral shedding in adults is associated with a reduced incubation period and more severe SRI (Douglas et al., 1966b). A measurable increase in temperature is more likely to occur in children than in adults but fever can be found among either group (Dick et al., 1967, Andrewes, 1966, Miller et al., 2007). Additional clinical sensitivity may be achieved for children by sampling from episodes of atypical symptoms including uncharacteristic irritability, disturbed sleep patterns and feeding difficulties due to snuffles.",

However, URT infections involving bacteria more commonly accompany viral detection (Lehtinen et al., 2006). The isolation and PCR detection of viruses from middle ear fluids (Evans et al., 1975), failure to grow bacteria from HRV-positive fluids even in the absence of antibiotic treatment (Sung et al., 1993) and the refractory nature of some AOM cases to antibiotic therapies indicated viruses played some role in illness. Picornaviruses have been detected in 30% of nasopharyngeal swabs taken from symptomatic and asymptomatic AOM-prone infants and young children and large quantities of HRV RNA have been detected by in situ hybridisation of adenoid tissues from children with recurrent AOM (Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 2005, Rihkanen et al., 2004).

            "text": "The clinical consequences of a first infection by most respiratory viruses are more severe than those following repeat infection (Ketler et al., 1962). Acute LRT infections contribute to more morbidity and mortality than HIV infection, malaria, cancer or heart attack (Mizgerd, 2006). In particular, the importance of HRV infection in LRT morbidity during the first year of life is underappreciated (Kusel et al., 2006). Because of their small-calibre immature airways, neonates and infants are more susceptible to poor outcomes from SRIs as a result of airway swelling, excessive secretions and smooth muscle contraction during ARTI (Table 5\n) (Bardin et al., 1992). If HRVs naturally replicate in the LRT (Papadopoulos et al., 1999b), then a local inflammatory effect is a feasible pathogenic mechanism and evidence exists for HRV replication in non-nasal tissues including smooth muscle (Hakonarson et al., 1998) and bronchial epithelial cells (Gern et al., 2008, Jakiela et al., 2007). If not local, then the effect must be remotely triggered by URT HRV infection with concomitant systemic transmission of the immunopathologic effects (Bardin et al., 1992) or translocation of the mediators into the LRT. While HRVs have been associated with 3-fold more LRT and wheezy LRT illnesses than HRSV (Kusel et al., 2006), the risk of some LRT illnesses is similar whether an HRV, HRSV or both, are detected (Aberle et al., 2005); co-detection has been associated with more severe LRT illness than detection of HRV alone (Aberle et al., 2005). A sixth of HRV isolate-positive young children exhibit symptoms of LRT illness (mostly wheezing) and the frequency of isolation rises when underlying diseases involving the immune or cardiorespiratory systems exist (Krilov et al., 1986). In adults \u226540 years of age, the duration of symptoms and frequency of LRT illness associated with HRV isolation increase with age, peaking at nearly two-thirds of their total respiratory illness burden (Monto et al., 1987).",

The mechanisms underlying the induction or exacerbation of asthma are not yet fully understood (Bardin et al., 1992, Martinez, 2007) but wheezing is blamed for excessive use of antibiotics, for being the primary cause of hospitalization among children and rarely, for death (Jartti et al., 2004b, Mallia and Johnston, 2006, Pattemore et al., 1992). Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are often preceded by a symptomatic rather than asymptomatic HRV episode (Heymann et al., 2005, Pattemore et al., 1992, Lidwell and Sommerville, 1951, Green et al., 2007, Johnston et al., 1995, Minor et al., 1974b) although in some instances, an exacerbation is the only evidence of infection (Roldaan and Masural, 1982).

Asthma in children also appears to be a risk factor for more frequent symptomatic viral infections. However, the presence of atopy or allergy does not appear to be a common feature (Pattemore et al., 1992, Rakes et al., 1999) since only a small proportion of allergic children have asthma (Yoo et al., 2007). It is unclear if the risk of atopic asthma during infancy is increased by SRIs which affect the development of the immune system, or whether SRIs trigger asthma development in children with a genetic predisposition to more severe outcomes following HRV infection (Hershenson and Johnston, 2006, Gern and Busse, 2002, Martin et al., 2006).",

A similar situation has been reported for HMPV infection (Rawlinson et al., 2003). The Childhood Origins of Asthma Study (COAST) used sampling criteria that were designed to intentionally investigate the role of HRSV in illness, but the data indicated HRVs, not HRSV, were the most important predictor of subsequent wheezing in early childhood (van der Zalm et al., 2006, Lemanske et al., 2005). Although total SRIs did not differ significantly, asthmatics had more HRV infections, while their siblings had more bacterial infections. Since asthmatics are more often treated with antibiotics, bacterial detection rates may be falsely lowered in some reports (Minor et al., 1974a).",

The TH-2 response manages humoral immunity and stimulates B cells via interleukin(IL)-4 (initiating production of IgE), IL-5 (influencing eosinophils) and IL-13 (a crucial component of allergen-induced asthma). The TH-1 response manages cellular immunity and produces IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3. These two T cell responses act in concert with epithelial-derived chemokines (e.g. eotaxin) to promote the recruitment and activation of eosinophils and mast cells, contributing to chronic airway inflammation and the hyper-responsiveness of airways to a variety of non-specific stimuli (Gern and Busse, 2002). Although it is upregulated by HRV infection, the TH-1 response in asthmatics is comparatively deficient (Papadopoulos et al., 2002b, McFadden, 2003, Wark et al., 2005). An increased TH-1-like cytokine response, deduced from higher sputum mRNA IFN-\u03b3/IL-5 values, clears HRV and more rapidly resolves symptoms (Gern et al., 2000). Induction of the type III IFNs, IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2/3, is also impaired in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic but not normal subjects in whom levels are inversely associated with HRV load and symptom severity (Contoli et al., 2006). IFN-\u03b3-induced protein 10 and RANTES are induced by HRV replication in bronchial cells; the former protein is a useful biomarker of virus-induced acute asthma associated with more severe airflow obstruction and reduced response to bronchodilators (Wark et al., 2007). Rising G-CSF and IL-8 (chemo-attractant for neutrophils) levels in the URT (protein detection in nasal wash) and LRT (mRNA in sputum) accompany rises in blood and nasal neutrophil numbers and in symptom severity in normal and atopic individuals (Gern et al., 2000, Cate et al., 1964, Levandowski et al., 1988, Turner et al., 1998). HRV binding to ICAM-1 may modify neutrophil migration and T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxic or TH interactions with HRV-infected cells by upregulating receptor expression (Hakonarson et al., 1998). Apart from proasthmatic changes to the responsiveness of the tissue, ICAM-I induction may also encourage eosinophil and T cell infiltration into the lower airways of asthmatic individuals and disrupt normal neutrophil trafficking potentiating the bacterial infections seen in AOM (Staunton et al., 1989, Martin et al., 2006, Sung et al., 1993).",

One possible cause of the TH-1 deficiency in asthmatics is inadequate maturation of type I and III IFN responses due to reduced exposure to infections early in life (Johnston, 2007). The \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 (Strachan, 1989) posited a pathway for the development of allergic diseases such as hay fever and asthma, conditions rising in prevalence in the post-industrial world. The suggestion is that paediatric infections play some role in preventing allergic disease so it is noteworthy that children cared for in day and group care settings have more infections than those cared for at home (Wald et al., 1988). A mechanism addressing the hygiene hypothesis is eloquently described by Gern and Busse (2002) in terms of the young, unchallenged immune system, initially set towards a TH2-like response being dependent on infections to stimulate the development of its TH1-like functions. One intriguing theory is that HRV infections play a central role in developing an efficacious antiviral immunity, particularly in infancy, via their ubiquitous, frequent and usually mild, self-limiting infections (Yoo et al., 2007).",

Consequently, quantifying levels of strain-specific serum antibody became routine practice prior to study commencement. Adult volunteer infection studies determined that no infections resulted in volunteers with pre-existing neutralizing antibody titres \u22651:16 and as levels grew from 0, so did levels of resistance to infection (Dick et al., 1967, Hendley et al., 1972). Nonetheless, adults could be protected by serum titres of 1:3\u20131:8 (Hendley et al., 1969, Dick et al., 1967) with a general trend toward decreasing numbers of SRIs with increasing age. The trend is broken by a spike in isolates from adults in the 20\u201339 years age group, presumably those having the children who acquire and then bring currently circulating strains into the household (Monto et al., 1987).",

The IgA response does not appear to modify illness or virus shedding but protects against infection and re-infection if in sufficient titre. Other studies have identified that adults, without pre-existing nasal antibody to an experimental challenge virus, may succumb to more severe SRI and shed more virus for longer (Holmes et al., 1976, Buscho et al., 1972). Antibody levels in nasal washes fall comparatively faster than serum levels (Buscho et al., 1972), especially in isolated populations, which might explain why volunteers with pre-study serum antibody (but presumably no IgA) can still become infected (Dick et al., 1967, Cate et al., 1965, Holmes et al., 1976).

However data are limited on the effectiveness of over-the-counter common-cold medications for children (Smith and Feldman, 1993). The interruption of pro-inflammatory immune responses or specific signalling pathways using steroids may prove to be a more robust approach for treating HRV infections, but has not been successful for other respiratory viruses associated with expiratory wheezing (Gern and Busse, 2002). When initiated early in the illness, a combination of antiviral and anti-inflammatory components shows promise for interrupting nasal viral replication and symptoms (Gwaltney et al., 2002).",

Two of the amino acid positions within VP1 known to interact with pleconaril, 152 and 191, have been implicated in this natural resistance; Phe152 and Leu191 which replace Tyr152 and Val191 (Ledford et al., 2004), respectively. Position 191 alone confers the most significant impact and different permutations of substitutions create a gradient of resistance; change in both positions confers complete resistance, demonstrated by the resistant HRV B strains (Ledford et al., 2005).",

We initiated a retrospective PCR-based investigation of respiratory specimens and identified a dichotomous cluster of around a dozen potential UPVs (Arden et al., 2006, McErlean et al., 2007), sharing limited identity with any subgenomic coding sequence residing on GenBank. We proposed that these belonged to HRV strains comprising a novel clade of the HRV A species, which we called HRV A2 (Arden et al., 2006). Similar subgenomic sequences were subsequently found in the United States (Lamson et al., 2006, Renwick et al., 2007) indicating a global distribution to these putative new HRVs since there are significant similarities with the first UPV sequences described. Our investigations resulted in the complete polyprotein coding sequence (Fig. 6a) of an HRV A2 strain, HRV-QPM. It proved to be the first such identification and characterization performed solely by molecular means and the first novel HRV described, although not yet isolated, in two decades. The complete coding sequences of similar, unculturable strains were subsequently reported; two \u2018HRV-Xs\u2019 from an adult asthma study in the United States (Kistler et al., 2007a) and three \u2018HRV-Cs\u2019 detected from a paediatric population studied for HBoV, by Lau et al.

Both the P1 and P3 regions share greater amino acid identity with members of HRV A, while the 2CPRO region is more similar to that from HRV B strains (Fig. 6b). No signs of recombination have been identified to date but the HRV-QPM sequence is so far the only divergent HRV to have been investigated in detail (McErlean et al., 2007). Across the subgenomic regions currently employed to assign species to the genus Rhinovirus (P1, 2C and 3CD), HRV C-like strains are genetically distinct, sharing only 53\u201357% average amino acid identity with the nearest species while retaining 62\u201398% identity with each other. Ascribing these strains to a species is strictly the purvey of the ICTV however these and other features strongly suggest that strains in the previously defined HRV A2 clade should be redefined as a novel species of HRV, which could be entitled Human rhinovirus C (HRV C); as previously initiated (Lau et al., 2007), further expanded upon (McErlean et al., 2008) and under independent consideration by the picornavirus study group (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/). Nonetheless, there are several traditional phenotypic traits including acid stability, neutralization pattern, receptor usage and antiviral susceptibility that cannot currently be qualified, delaying reliable taxonomic placement. We sought to address these by creating computer-based models of HRV-QPM.",

The largest peaks in HRV-QPM prevalence in 2003 followed the return from school break after both second (mid-year) and fourth (end of year) term holidays (McErlean et al., 2007). Variants were identified in infants enduring mild to severe SRIs that commonly manifested as acute expiratory wheezing (only HRV-QPM detected) or persistent cough (commonly HRV-QPM accompanied by another virus) usually requiring hospitalization and often receiving supplemental oxygen. HRV-QPM was the only virus found in 65% of its detections (McErlean et al., 2007, McErlean et al., 2008). Investigations to date have yielded HRV-QPM variants in Europe, the United States (Lee et al., 2007) and elsewhere in Australia during 2003, indicating their global and probably endemic circulation.",

This is impressive considering that up until 2007, only eight complete genomes resided in the public domain, mostly appearing between 1984 and 1988. In 2007 the number of genome sequences increased to nearly 50 (Kistler et al., 2007b, Tapparel et al., 2007, McErlean et al., 2007, Lau et al., 2007, Kistler et al., 2007a). The sequences of all traditional HRV strains should be available soon (Rathe, 2008). Our interpretations derived from the literature and our ongoing studies suggest there could be as many more HRV strains circulating, ascribed to new and existing species, as there are currently known HRV strains. Furthermore, the divergent viruses may have novel or fastidious requirements for cultivation, utilize different molecules as receptors, circulate during a specific season, be unexpectedly resistant to some antivirals and perhaps be associated with specific clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "Interest in the field of rhinovirology is on the rise, and the attention is long overdue. Early studies of adults and older children perhaps defined the mild clinical impact still associated with infection by the \u2018common cold\u2019 viruses and possibly detracted from further characterization of the populous viral super-group. The emergence of HIV also undermined HRV characterization in the 1980s; the common cold could hardly compete with AIDS for research dollars (Tyrrell and Fielder, 2002). However, the emergent SARS-CoV, may have returned respiratory virus hunting to the research radar. Once working in the field, it is impossible to ignore the dominance of HRV infections in many aspects of respiratory tract illnesses. Thankfully, some researchers held their ground when HRV research was less popular, continuously producing important immunobiological and virological data, investigating a role for the HRVs in our immune development and identifying their greater impact among hosts with certain immune deficiencies. Previous studies were weakened by unreliable cultivation techniques, laborious and possibly cross-reactive serological methods and the confounding and seemingly random contribution of UPVs to HRV epidemiology. These problems confused the definition of HRV infection frequency and the extent of their clinical impact on early childhood illness. We now know that HRVs play a central role in expiratory wheezing, contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance and are associated with hospitalization of children negative for other viruses. Such findings are driven by an improved diagnostic capacity and aided by the increasing popularity of virus hunting. Clearly, for clinical infectious disease studies to have significant power, all pathogens must first be identified and then comprehensively characterized. It is already apparent that modern tools and greater attention to the HRVs has meant that earlier associations between respiratory illness and infection by single, \u201ctraditional\u201d viruses do not retain their significance today. Limited data comprehensively address HRV strain-specific circulation patterns, antiviral resistance, sequence variability or the possibility of robust associations between HRV strains or species and specific clinical outcomes. We also do not know the extent of their involvement in fine-tuning, or perhaps developing, aspects of our immunological defences and yet the HRVs seem to play some role (Johnston and Openshaw, 2001). Today, renewed interest in HRVs is fuelled by the molecular characterization of traditional HRV genomes and the discovery of divergent strains. Now is the time to address the unanswered questions which litter a particularly neglected battlefield in one of the many wars between viruses and their human hosts.",

(a) The genome structure (exemplified by HRV-QPM, GenBank accession number EF186077 including the nucleotide positions separating coding regions) is illustrated to identify the polyprotein and the subsequent precursory (P1-3) and matured proteins (named in filled boxes below the genome). The structural and non-structural regions encompass 11 proteins. Co-translational cleavage of the approximately 250 kDa polyprotein is mediated by the virus-encoded protease, 2APRO which catalyses its own release, freeing P1 from the P2 and P3 regions. All subsequent post-translational cleavages are performed by the 3C protease (3CPRO), which is also likely to free itself from the polyprotein (Racaniello, 2001). The three regions commonly contributing to taxonomic placement are underlined by dashed bars. (b) A single asymmetric unit included to simplify the visualization of capsid features and symmetry. The approximate placement of the canyon (bold line; canyon faces also indicated) and the subsurface binding pocket (dashed grey oval) are indicated as are the axes of symmetry including a small filled pentagon indicating the 5-fold axis and a small oval and triangles indicating 2- and 3-fold axes of symmetry. (c) A depiction of an HRV icosahedral capsid comprising 60 of the smallest capsid units or protomers. A viral pentamer is highlighted (grey shaded panels) composed of five protomers. The HRVs assemble their capsid into an icosahedron. HRV virions are approximately 30 nm in diameter (Rotbart, 2002). (d) A pair of facing protomers (indicated on (c) by darker grey panels) depicted in cross-section using a space-filling format. Each protomer consists of a single copy of the three exposed structural proteins VP1-VP3 and the internalized structural protein, VP4 (7kDa) (Stirk and Thornton, 1994, Rossmann et al., 1985, Rotbart, 2002). The binding pocket (asterisk, \u2018*\u2019; usually filled by a \u2018pocket factor\u2019) is located beneath the \u2018canyon\u2019, a distinctive deep (2.5 nm) cleft; site of major receptor interactions. The canyon, comprised mostly of VP1 and VP3 residues, encircles the point at which five protomers come together to create the 5-fold axis (Rossmann, 1994, Rossmann et al., 1985). The canyon rim restricts entry of the 3.5 nm Fab portion of antibody molecules, evident in the conservation of the canyon floor which is sequestered away from immune pressures and provides a safe harbour for receptor contact among the majority of known HRV strains (Rossmann et al., 1985, Pevear et al., 1989).

(A) The examples provided here represent different, hypothetical studies for a single individual. If sampling occurred at each time point (i\u2013vii) and if each positive was characterized, three different HRV strains could be identified from a single subject (period of replication by each strain indicated by a grey box; strain identity is provided on the left). If typing was not performed and sampling only occurred intermittently (indicated by the shapes in Example 1 (triangles), 2 (circles) and 3 (squares)), then the laboratory data could suggest only one or two infections. If testing was only performed during a symptomatic period (usually when the study starts) and again at the conclusion of the study period (Example 1), accurate determination of HRV infection frequency or strain diversity would not be possible. Example 2 identifies a case when sampling at the cessation of a study would not identify the HRV-BB strain however symptoms could be apparent due to its soon-to-be-detectable (detection indicated by the filled circle) replication. Strain BB may be prohibited from significant replication (indicated by the brevity of the infection period) due to pre-existing immunity which results in an asymptomatic state that still yields a relevant positive detection. In Example 3, sampling is only conducted for an SRI and so HRV BB is not detected. (B) HRV-KS is a truly chronic infection by a single strain whereas HRV-TC exemplifies some culture-based studies where the same strain appeared to recur after a period of absence, in the same individual. Some of these study designs could conclude persistent shedding was occurring, confounding attempts to correlate symptomatic periods with individual HRV strains and perpetuating the belief that HRVs do not exist independently of their group.",
