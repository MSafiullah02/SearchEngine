In early 2004, a novel human coronavirus associated with upper respiratory tract infections, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), was also discovered (11, 47) . Phenotypically, the envelopes of all coronaviruses are studded with long, petal-shaped spikes, resulting in the appearance of a crown under the electron microscope. Genotypically, coronaviruses possess the largest genomes of all RNA viruses of about 30 kb. As a result of a unique mechanism of viral replication, coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination (24, 25, 29, 31) . The order of the genes in the genomes of all coronaviruses that encode the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (pol) and the four structural proteins present in all coronaviruses is 5'-pol, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)-3'. Based on serological and genotypic characterization, coronaviruses were divided into three distinct groups, with HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 being group 1 coronaviruses and HCoV-OC43 a group 2 coronavirus respectively (11, 26, 47) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "(24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 533, "end": 536, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 537, "end": 540, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 541, "end": 544, "text": "31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1007, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1011, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1015, "text": "47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Recently, we have described the discovery of a group 2 novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1), and its complete genome sequence (48) (49) (50) .

The 3CL pro of coronaviruses are named as such because their structures and substrate specificities resemble those of the 3C proteases in picornaviruses. In all known coronaviruses, the P1 positions at the cleavage sites of the 3CL pro are occupied by glutamine, whereas the P1' positions are occupied by aliphatic amino acids, including alanine, glycine, cysteine, asparagine and serine (3, 9, 16, 23) . In most cases, the P1' positions are occupied by alanine, glycine or serine. Occasionally, in group 2 coronaviruses, the P1' positions are occupied by cysteine (30) ; and in rhinoviruses, by asparagines (3). In CoV-HKU1, multiple alignment with the genome sequences of other coronaviruses revealed that all, except one, P1 positions of putative cleavage sites of 3CL pro are occupied by glutamine. The exception lies at the junction between nsp10 (helicase) and nsp11 (member of exonuclease family), where the P1 position is occupied by histidine. This probably represents a novel cleavage site due to the following reasons. First, the sequence is genuine instead of a result of RT-PCR or sequencing errors because the same position has been amplified and sequenced four times in different clinical specimens of the index patient (48) . Second, the same mutation was consistently found in the genome sequence of the CoV-HKU1 in the second patient with pneumonia (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that it is due to an occasionally occurring mutation in just one patient. Third, in all other group 2 coronaviruses with genome sequences available (MHV, BCoV and HCoV-OC43), the P2, P1', P2', P3', P4', P5', P6', P7', P8', P9', P10', P11' and P12' positions of this cleavage site are all occupied by leucine/valine [shown to be important for 3CL pro cleavage (35) ], cysteine, serine/threonine, threonine, asparagines, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, aspartic acid, cysteine, serine, lysine/arginine and serine respectively, which are also present at the corresponding positions in CoV-HKU1 ( Fig. 2) . Fourth, this amino acid substitution is probably due to a single nucleotide mutation in the CoV-HKU1 genome, CAG (as in MHV) or CAA (as in BCoV and HCoV-OC43) (which encodes glutamine) to CAT (which encodes histidine). Finally, as the helicase is one of the most conserved proteins in coronaviruses, cleavage between nsp10 and nsp11 should be an essential step for the generation of the mature functional helicase. The present novel putative cleavage site, as well as some other atypical cleavage sites by 3CL pro , were not predicted by a program for prediction of 3CL pro cleavage sites (21) . Experiments, including purification of the CoV-HKU1 helicase in its native form and C-terminal amino acid sequencing and trans-cleavage assays of the CoV-HKU1 3CL pro will confirm the presence of this novel cleavage site.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 604, "end": 610, "text": "(3, 9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 781, "end": 785, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1455, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1990, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2823, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2220, "end": 2227, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Proteolytic Cleavage of Replicase Polyprotein"}, {"text": "The replicase polyprotein of CoV-HKU1 is putatively cleaved by its PL pro and 3CL pro into 16 polypeptides (Table 1) .

However, unlike other coronaviruses, there are 16 tandem copies of a 10-amino acid repeat near the C terminal of the acidic domain. The first 14 tandem copies are perfect repeats of NDDENVVTGD, with four of the 10 amino acids being either glutamic acid or aspartic acid. The last two copies are imperfect repeats of NNDEEIVTGD and NDDQIVVTGD respectively. In picornaviruses, it has been found that there were three tandem copies of 24 imperfect amino acid repeats, named VPg1, VPg2 and VPg3 (10) . However, no specific functions have been found for these tandem repeats. Downstream to the acidic domain is the PL1 pro (amino acids 334-549 of nsp1), with the characteristic catalytic dyad of cysteine and a downstream histidine. Moreover, similar to the PL1 pro of other coronaviruses, four conserved cysteine residues (Cys 429 , Cys 432 , Cys 455 and Cys 457 ) that may contain a Zn 2\u03e9 binding motif are present. Downstream to PL1 pro is the X domain (amino acids 550-709 of nsp1) that contains putative ADP-ribose 1\"-phosphatase (ADRP) activity [amino acids 575-685 of nsp1 belonging to Appr-1-p processing enzyme family (Pfam accession no. PF01661)]. The putative ADRP activity was first described for this domain by Snijder et al. (43) . In other microorganisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other eukaryotes, ADRP and its functionally related enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPDase), were important for tRNA processing (33). ADP-ribose 1\",2\"-cyclic phosphate (Appr\u03fep) is produced as a result of tRNA splicing. Appr\u03fep is converted to ADP-ribose 1\"-phosphate (Appr-1\"p) by CPDase. Appr-1\"p is then further processed by ADRP. In other group 2 coronaviruses, both putative ADRP and CPDase (in NS2a) homologues are present (43) . Interestingly, in CoV-HKU1 and also SARS-CoV, only ADRP, but not CPDase [NS2a is not present in CoV-HKU1 (48)], is present. Downstream to the X domain, there is a segment of 134 amino acids, also present in other coronaviruses, with no matches of known functions found by BLAST search. Downstream to this segment of unknown function is the putative PL2 pro (amino acids 844-1140 of nsp1), with the characteristic catalytic dyad of cysteine and a downstream histidine. Similar to the PL2 pro of other coronaviruses, four conserved cysteine residues (Cys 1026 , Cys 1028 , Cys 1060 and Cys 1062 ) that may contain a Zn 2\u03e9 binding motif are also present. At the C terminal of nsp1, similar to other coronaviruses, there is a Y domain with two hydrophobic stretches and 11 conserved Cys/His residues present in the N terminal 889 amino acids (30) . Ziebuhr et al. speculated that this Y domain may be responsible for anchoring nsp1 into membranes and binding cations (55) .
