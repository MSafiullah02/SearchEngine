It is worth noting that they have been presenting different performance metrics and using a diverse number of images and datasets. These practices make their comparison very challenging. Some of the metrics include Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Area Under Curve (AUC), Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. A quick elucidation on their definition can be useful. The accuracy of a method determines how correct the values are predicted. The precision determines the reproducibility of the measurement or how many of the predictions are correct. Recall shows how many of the correct results are discovered. F1-score uses a combination of precision and recall to calculate a balanced average result.",

The work used deep learning models for segmentation only so that it could identify the infected area in CT images between healthy and infected patients. It was based on UNet++ semantic segmentation model [86] , used to extract valid areas in the images. It used 289 randomly selected CT images and tested it on other 600 randomly selected CT images. The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV (positive prediction value) of 84.62%, and NPV(negative prediction value) of 100%. In the retrospective dataset, it resulted in a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61%. The trained model from this study was deployed at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) to accelerate the diagnosis of new COVID-19 cases. It was also open-sourced on the Internet as to enable rapid review of new cases in other locations. A cloud-based open-access artificial intelligence platform was constructed to provide support for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide.

Chuansheng Zheng [85] proposed 3D deep convolutional neural Network (DeCoVNet) to Detect COVID-19 from CT volumes. The weakly supervised deep learning model could accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The CT images were segmented using a pre-trained UNet. It used 499 CT volumes for training, collected from 13 December 2019 to 23 January 2020, and 131 CT volumes for testing, collected from 24 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The authors chose a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative cases. The algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840, and a high negative predictive value of 0.982. The developed deep learning model is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection. ",

            "text": "The drawback of using CT imaging is the need for high patient dose and enhanced cost [38] . It makes digital chest x-ray radiography (CXR) as the imaging modality with the lower cost and wider availability for detecting chest pathology. Therefore, automated diagnosis of COVID-19 features in CXR will make it a highly useful diagnostic tool against the disease. Digital X-ray imagery computer-aided diagnosis is used for different diseases, including osteoporosis [55] , cancer [4] and cardiac disease [66] . However, as it is really hard to distinguish soft tissue with a poor contrast in X-ray imagery, contrast enhancement is used as pre-processing step [36] [21] . Lung segmentation of chest X-rays is a crucial and important step in order to identify lung nodules and various segmentation approaches are proposed in the literature [54] [9] [19] [24] . CXR examinations have shown consolidation in COVID-19 infected patients. In one study at Hong Kong [48] , three different patients had daily CXR, two of them showed progression in the lung consolidation over 3-4 days. Further CXR examinations show improvement over the subsequent two days. The third patient showed no significant changes over an 8-day period. However, a similar study showed that the ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe periphery on the CT are not visible on the chest radiograph, which was taken 1 hour apart from the first study. However, CXR is still recommended alongside CT for better radiological analysis. Various CXR-related automated approaches have been proposed. The following section discusses the most salient work while Table 2 presents a more systematic presentation of such methods.",

A comprehensive review of medical applications of infrared thermography is provided by B.B. Lahiri [74] [39] , including fever screening. Somboonkaew et al. [63] proposed a mobile-platform for an automatic fever screening system based on infrared forehead temperature. Best practices for standardized performance and testing of infrared thermographs intended for fever screening are discussed by Ghassemi et al. [26] . Negishi T [47] proposed an Infection Screening System Using Thermography and CCD Camera with Good Stability and Swiftness for Non-contact Vital-Signs Measurement by Feature Matching and MUSIC Algorithm. Earlier for SARD spread control, Chiu et al. [15] proposed a computer vision systems help in fever screening, which was used in earlier outbreaks of SARS. From 13 April to 12 May 2003, 72,327 patients and visitors passed through the only entrance allowed at TMU-WFH where a thermography station was in operation. Additional miscellaneous approaches for prevention and control are also worth noting. An example is pandemic drones using remote sensing and digital imagery, which were recommended for identifying infected people. Al-Naji et al. [5] have used such a system for remote life sign monitoring in disaster management in the past. A similar application is to use vision-guided robot control for 3D object recognition and manipulation. Moreover, 3D modelling and printers are helping to maintain the supply of healthcare equipment in this troubled time. Joshua M. Pearce [52] discusses RepRap-class 3-D printers and open-source microcontrollers. The applications are relevant since mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. Lastly, germ scanning is an important step against combating COVID-19. Edouard A. Hay [30] have proposed a convolutional neural network for germ scanning such as the identification of bacteria Light-sheet microscopy image data with more than 90% accuracy. Over a period of one month, hundred and five patients or visitors were detected to have a thermographic fever detection Edouard A.

A disease progression score is recommended to classify different types of infected patients in [29] . It is called corona score\" and is calculated by measurements of infected areas and the severity of disease from CT images. The corona score measures the progression of patients over time, and it is computed by a volumetric summation of the network-activation maps. Graeme MacLaren [45] supports that radiological evidence can also be an important tool to distinguish critical ill patients. Yunlu Wang [73] used depth camera and deep learning as abnormal respiratory patterns classifier that may contribute to large-scale screening of people infected with the virus accurately and unobtrusively. Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. They proposed GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify six clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea) to identify critically ill patients. The proposed model can classify the respiratory patterns with accuracy, precision, recall and F1 of 94.5%, 94.4%, 95.1% and 94.8%, respectively. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be accessed online (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11493666.v1).",

In the current release, there are 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia images. The authors said that they would continue to update this database as soon as new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The project can be found at GitHub with MATLAB codes and trained models: https://github.com/tawsifur/COVID-19-Chest-X-ray-Detection. The research team managed to classify COVID-19, Viral pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.3%.
