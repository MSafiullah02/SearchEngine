            "text": "In 1998, a review of NHAP included an evaluation of 18 studies published between 1978 and 1994 that provided information on etiology.3 Almost all of these studies utilized sputum cultures to identify etiology. However, the results of sputum cultures differed substantially depending on whether or not strict criteria (>25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and <10 epithelial cells per 100 power field of undiluted sputum sample) were used to exclude oropharyngeal contamination of the sample. Studies that did not evaluate sputum samples for oropharyngeal contamination identified gram-negative bacilli in 3% to 55% of sputum cultures, whereas in the studies that used strict criteria 0% to 12% of cultures contained gram-negative bacilli. In the studies that utilized strict criteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 4% to 25% of sputum cultures, nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae in 0% to 22%, and Staphylococcus aureus in 1% to 6; atypical organisms were rare, and only 1 study evaluated for viruses. The role of atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and viruses could not be determined due to lack of information about these pathogens in the studies available. Thus, the pattern of sputum isolates from residents with pneumonia resembled that found in hospitalized patients with CAP. The results of this review informed, in part, recommendations for treatment of NHAP in the nursing home in CAP treatment guidelines in 2000 and 2003.4\n,\n5\n",

The basis for the HCAP category was the finding that resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were being identified more often in patients from the community with infection and this pattern of isolates was more consistent with those isolated in hospital-acquired pneumonia than CAP.7, 8, 9, 10 The HCAP category consisted of a heterogenous group of community-dwelling patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia (Table 1\n). These patients had a common risk factor: frequent or recent contact with the healthcare system and/or recent antibiotic therapy. Inclusion of nursing home residence in the HCAP category was based on 2 studies of residents with severe pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation in whom invasive methods to identify the etiology of pneumonia were utilized.11\n,\n12 In these residents with presumed severe bacterial pneumonia, there was a high rate of isolation of gram-negative aerobic bacilli and MRSA. For patients with 1 or more HCAP criteria, the guideline recommended empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy consisting of 3 antibiotics (2 antipseudomonal agents and 1 for MRSA) that would also be effective for other potentially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli such as K pneumoniae and Acinetobacter species.6 The rationale for recommending this regimen was to make sure a patient received appropriate therapy initially, which was identified as an important predictor of morbidity and mortality.13\n,\n14\n",

            "text": "Following publication of the ATS/IDSA guideline,6 a controversy developed regarding the validity of the concept that patients with pneumonia admitted to the hospital and meeting 1 or more of the HCAP criteria had a high probability of infection because of a resistant organism and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Recent publications have reviewed this controversy in detail.15\n,\n16 The major concern was that such an approach would expose patients unnecessarily to multiple antibiotics and promote further development of resistance as well as other adverse effects such as C difficile infection. These reviews found evidence that the patient groups included in the HCAP category did not accurately identify the presence of resistant organisms, and hospital mortality was not increased in patients in this category after adjustment for age and comorbid disease.15 In addition, the majority of studies comparing guideline-concordant and -discordant treatment of HCAP did not demonstrate an advantage to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in terms of hospital mortality.15\n,\n16 As a result of these findings, the approach shifted from the HCAP categorization that focuses on particular clinical groups to identifying specific risk factors for the presence of resistant organisms that can be applied generally.17 Several algorithms that incorporate risk factors for resistant organisms were developed and found to perform better than HCAP criteria for identifying these organisms.17 Many of these models included residence in a nursing home as a risk factor for a resistant organism. Given all this pushback regarding the HCAP category, the updated ATS/IDSA guideline published in 2016 did not include this group and indicated that it would be part of an updated CAP guideline.18\n",

The role of atypical organisms as a cause of NHAP is difficult to determine because there was a distinct difference in the rate of identification of these pathogens among 4 studies, as noted above. Finally, viruses, primarily influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, have been identified in residents hospitalized with pneumonia; however, in some studies a virus was identified in conjunction with bacteria.",

The 2007 guideline recommended that nursing home residents admitted to the hospital with pneumonia be treated according to the 2005 ATS/IDSA guideline as a HCAP, but made no recommendations for treatment in the nursing home.6 However, the 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline recommended abandoning the HCAP classification and assessing patients for risk factors to determine need for MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage, but made no recommendations for treatment of NHAP in the nursing home.50 In the nursing home, there are several risk factors to consider that put a resident at risk for pneumonia due to a resistant organism (Table 3\n).51 The most important factors in the nursing home resident are a prior culture positive for a resistant organism, especially in the respiratory tract, and recent antibiotic therapy.",

First, there has been concern about using a macrolide alone because of increasing resistance of pneumococci, but there is little evidence to support the clinical relevance of this resistance.52 Nevertheless, the authors of the latest CAP guideline did not make a strong recommendation for the routine use of monotherapy with a macrolide for the outpatient treatment of CAP.50 Second, an oral fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, is no longer considered a first-line agent for treatment of NHAP because of multiple potential adverse effects.53 Third, it is not necessary to cover for atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydia, although doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone provide that coverage.",

Future research may be able to utilize molecular testing to define the etiology of NHAP, but the practicality of this approach in the \u201creal world\u201d setting is unclear given the cost of this testing and the need to have testing done at an off-site laboratory. Given the rarity of identifying the etiology of NHAP in the nursing home setting, treatment is almost always empiric. However, the optimum regimen(s) for the treatment of NHAP (including duration of therapy) in the nursing home has not been defined. For example, is there any additional improvement in outcome with the addition of a macrolide to a beta-lactam or cephalosporin in treatment of NHAP? A concern is the role of resistant organisms such as MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the etiology of NHAP. Clinicians practicing nursing need to be aware of the risk factors for colonization with a resistant organism (Table 3) and adjust empiric therapy accordingly. The most important risk factor for colonization with a resistant organism is respiratory colonization with MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa or recent antibiotic therapy. As discussed in a previous section, studies of the duration of treatment of CAP have documented that 3 to 5 days is equivalent to 7 to 10 days of therapy in terms of efficacy. However, these studies have excluded nursing home residents. Therefore, studies of the duration of NHAP in the nursing home setting should be considered, as this might impact on antibiotic resistance levels as well as other adverse events such as C difficile infection.",
