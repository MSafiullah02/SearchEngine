Therefore, in the absence of a vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment, it is important to understand long-term consequences of various SD strategies (i.e., type, duration, intensity, magnitude) on COVID-19 transmission dynamics.",

For example, the SD scenario modeled by Kissler et al. (2020) used a 60% SD on \u2013 60% SD off approach. Note, that recently released location data to index SD compliance indicates mean levels closer to 40% [3].

This protection rate was introduced to account for possible decreases in the number of susceptible people to the virus caused by factors other than social distancing such as the use of facemasks, hand washing, maintaining at least 5 feet to other people and avoiding agglomerations. Exposed people become infectious after an incubation time of 1/\u03b3 (Equation 4). Infected people stay infected for a period of 1/\u03b4 and can recover with no medical attention (m) or can be hospitalized (1-m). Hospitalized people (Equation 5) stay hospitalized for 1/\u03b6 days and can either recover (1-c) or become critical (c) needing to go to an Intensive care unit (ICU). A person stays on average 1/ \u03b5 in the ICU (Equation 6) and can either go back to the hospital (1-f) or die (f; Equation 7).

Alpha was optimized considering the window of time from the beginning of the pandemic until present day, and it was manipulated afterwards in different windows of time to project possible future scenarios. Changes in \u03b1 causes changes in the number of people that are unsusceptible to the disease at a given time; we exhibit alpha manipulations as the percentage ratio of the unsusceptible or protected people over the country\u2019s population (i.e. Protection (%)). Note, that insusceptibility in our model accounts for a time-dependent state of an individual that because of his/her behavior can change from susceptibility to insusceptibility or the other way around.",

Times windows were either 40 or 80 days. Every scenario was simulated with protection percentage decreasing with time and eventually plateauing at either 50% or 30%.

This finding is consistent with research indicating that wearing facemasks regardless of symptoms is crucial for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 [15] and recommendations by the CDC [18]. In fact, the Manhattan Project for COVID- 19 recommend that the US require all citizens to use facemasks in public [19]. Public use of facemasks are common in China and other nations in Asia. However, many US citizens report that facemasks are uncomfortable and inconvenient with some refusing to comply with the recommendations [20]. As such, policy mandates may be needed to increase public adherence to using personal protection equipment.",

            "text": "With the economic burden of SD increasing and people growing weary of restrictions there is major concern with how a decline in SD will affect COVID-19 infections and associated deaths. At the peak of the pandemic in the US, our analysis of location data [3] indicated that the magnitude of SD was at 60%, just a few weeks later, current levels are at 40% SD. According to our projections, some level of SD needs to continue over the next two years. If the US stops practicing social distancing (SD = 0) or maintains levels lower than 10% our simulations indicate the pandemic will quickly worsen and deplete available health resources. This result is consistent with models indicating that SD may be in place for an extended period [2]. Interestingly, however, our models indicate the more critical factor in the best-case scenarios was the level of personal caution (engaging in PPM). If personal caution levels were maintained at 50%, SD could be reduced to 15% average across time without crossing the threshold for available ICU beds. Increasing SD to an average of 20% was not more beneficial. Although 20% average SD was effective at maintaining control of the first peak, the second peak was in fact much larger. This result is consistent with the notion that a one-time SD may result in a catastrophic second peak, if the virus reoccurred and not enough people have immunity [2,21]. Alternatively, intermittent strategies may allow for periods of transmission resulting in herd immunity without overwhelming hospital resources [2,22]. Indeed, the Kissler model [2] indicated that intermittent SD was the best-case scenario to maintain control over the pandemic. Note, however, that previous COVID-19 projection models have not explored scenarios associated with stepping-down strategies.",

The approach we modeled was multiplying SD values of 40%, 30% and 20% by 1, then 1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8 and then back to 1 and repeat. Similar, to the argument made for intermittent SD a stepping-down strategy may allow for periods of transmission without burdening hospital resources. Our modal indicated that the stepping-down was more effective at maintaining control over the pandemic than intermittent SD. In addition, the modeled stepping-down strategy resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5% compared to the best intermittent and constant strategies. A 6.5% reduction in the time required to SD may have significant economic and psychological benefits. The best-case scenario indicated by our model was a stepping-down strategy with an 80-day window. That is, an 80-day period in between each SD level. According to our model, this scenario prevented a second peak while the number of ICUs needed per day was within the threshold of those currently available.",
