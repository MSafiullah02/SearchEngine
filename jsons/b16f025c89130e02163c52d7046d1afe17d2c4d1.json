DPP4-mediated enzymatic cleavage alternatively inactivates peptides or generates new bioactive moieties that may exert competing or novel activities. The widespread use of selective DPP4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has heightened interest in the molecular mechanisms through which DPP4 inhibitors exert their pleiotropic actions. Here we review the biology of DPP4 with a focus on: 1) identification of pharmacological vs physiological DPP4 substrates; and 2) elucidation of mechanisms of actions of DPP4 in studies employing genetic elimination or chemical reduction of DPP4 activity. We review data identifying the roles of key DPP4 substrates in transducing the glucoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, and cardiometabolic actions of DPP4 inhibitors in both preclinical and clinical studies.

The complexity of DPP4 action is amplified by the panoply of bioactive DPP4 substrates, which in turn act as elegant biochemical messengers in multiple tissues, including the immune and neuroendocrine systems. Biological interest in the DPP4 enzyme has heightened after the approval of highly selective DPP4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Several excellent reviews have highlighted results of clinical trials using DPP4 inhibitors to treat type 2 diabetes (6); others have compared the structures, pharmacokinetic differences, and comparative efficacy of unique DPP4 inhibitors (7) or summarized cardiovascular (8 -10) , renal (11) , or safety data (12) surrounding the use of DPP4 inhibitors. In this review, we approach the literature from a different perspective, highlighting the biology of the DPP4 enzyme and critically assessing experiments reporting the identification and role(s) of DPP4 substrates. We emphasize studies identifying DPP4 substrates and in turn assess our knowledge of how DPP4 inhibitors, acting through these substrates, transduce their pleiotropic actions in both preclinical and clinical studies.

In the mouse, Dpp4 is found on chromosome 2 (2C2-2D), and interestingly, exon 21 and exon 22 are present as a single 156-bp exon (19, 20) . DPP4 is widely expressed in numerous tissues including endothelial cells in multiple vascular beds (21) , rendering the enzyme highly accessible to peptide substrates circulating through the gut, liver, lung, and kidney (22) . The human gene encodes two predominant mRNA transcripts, a larger 4.2-kb mRNA whose distribution is widespread, and a 2.8-kb transcript restricted to the placenta, kidney, lung, and liver. Furthermore, multiple minor splice variants of the DPP4 gene have been described; however, the functional significance, if any, of the various mRNA transcripts, which may contain different 3\u0408-untranslated sequences or poly A tails, for translation of the classical bioactive DPP4 protein remains unclear (19, 20) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 165, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 361, "end": 369, "text": "(14 -16)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 412, "end": 416, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 417, "end": 421, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 767, "end": 771, "text": "(19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 877, "end": 881, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1002, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1502, "text": "(19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1506, "text": "20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "II.

SDF-1 is widely expressed in numerous cell types, and SDF-1 expression and secretion are often induced concomitant with cellular injury. Both SDF-1 isoforms are cleaved by soluble or cellular DPP4, which inactivates their antiviral and chemotactic properties in cell-based assays in vitro (127) . Because SDF-1 activity enhances migration of hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells to sites of ischemic injury, DPP4 inhibitors have been employed to enhance tissue healing, most commonly in the setting of myocardial or vascular ischemia. Importantly, DPP4 inhibition reduces N-terminal degradation of SDF-1 and potentiates SDF-1 action in vivo by enabling enhanced activation of its receptor, CXCR4, with greater stem cell mobilization to sites of injury (128) .
