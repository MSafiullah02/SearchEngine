The key events are the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the first IPCC report to discuss the economic impacts (Pearce et al., 1996) Table C .3 shows the contributions of estimates of the social cost of carbon published in a particular period to the overall kernel density and its quintiles. The quintile shares are statistically indistinguishable from the overall shares; \u03c7 2 16 = 4.14; p = 0.999. Figure 4 shows the kernel density of the growth rate of the social cost of carbon, decomposed for the pure rate of time preference. The density is symmetric for a 3.0% utility discount rate. However, for discount rates of 1.5% and 2.0%, little probability mass is added to the left tail, and a lot to the right tail. Table C .4 shows the shares by quintile of the kernel density. The same pattern is seen as in the graph, but Pearson's test for the equality of proportions does not reject the null hypothesis that the component densities are equal to the composite one; \u03c7 2 24 = 10.6; p = 0.992.",

Earlier estimates of the social cost of carbon are not different from later estimates. There appears to be no learning over time. The null hypothesis that different authors publish similar estimates cannot be rejected. Published estimates are not marked by subjectivity.",
