Integration of pharmacovigilance with clinical practice is a key area of interest to many ISoP members, often discussed within our chapters and special interest groups (SIGs) and at our meetings around the world. Timely review of incoming data and real-time signal detection can provide important safety information for healthcare providers. Therefore, ensuring and supporting the collection of high-quality data from adverse drug reaction reports in all countries will be essential responsibilities of our daily work.",

Some ISoP initiatives under development are summarised near the end of this article. Attention will also be required to detect false information, and we will endeavour to provide explanations and corrections in an effort to prevent harm.",

During the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ISoP executive committee (EC) has been directly in touch with individual ISoP members around the world. We know that many colleagues are working at the front line of clinical care or are in close support of others in key roles, and we want to offer the assistance of ISoP to any of you who need it, in whatever way we can help. A great strength of ISoP is the professional and personal support we provide to each other in the work we are performing around the world. Support of our pharmacovigilance colleagues in lower-income countries may be necessary as they will need to manage the same challenges with far more limited resources. Sharing of knowledge and insight into regulatory decisions as well as communication materials/social media campaigns can help to unload the burden of the few people often employed in many smaller national pharmacovigilance centres. Collaboration with other scientific organisations can demonstrate of the value of spontaneous reports as a form of real-world data. Queries of spontaneous databases combined with real-time observational studies using data from big data networks of insurance claims and electronic healthcare records can allow for more efficient evidence generation to explore any medicines safety issues that arise.",
