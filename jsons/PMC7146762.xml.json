At present it is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in the spanish paediatric population.1, 2 Its incidence in Europe is of approximately 8 per 100 000 children under 5 years.3, 4 Although the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and epidemiological characteristics of the disease suggest an infectious trigger, the causative agent has yet to be identified.5, 6 A few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on KD have been published that identified several plausible candidate loci involved in inflammation, the immune response and cardiovascular abnormalities.2, 7, 8 Thus, a reasonably broad hypothesis is that KD is caused by an infectious agent yet to be identified that only causes disease in individuals with a genetic predisposition. Its rarity in the first months of life and in adults suggests that this is a pathogen that these collectives are immune to, with very young infants being protected by passive immunity through maternal antibodies.",

Thus, our findings evince that the diagnosis of KD continues to pose a significant challenge. Considering the risk of cardiac complications associated with not treating a true case of KD, we believe that utmost caution and rigour should be exercised when advising against treatment, especially in the groups at highest risk, which include infants and severely ill patients.",

They found viruses in 50.4% of the ill children compared to 16.4% of healthy children (P\n < .001) and concluded that viral infections are associated with KD.4\n",

One such example is infection by adenovirus, whose symptoms overlap with those of KD and which happens to cause significant elevation of acute phase reactants in laboratory tests, as we observed in patients in our series. Jaggi et al.16 reported detection of adenovirus in the throat of patients with complete and incomplete KD and in healthy individuals, and found that in patients with complete KD, the viral load was significantly lower compared to patients with incomplete KD, which led them to conclude that a positive test result for adenovirus should be interpreted with caution, as it could indicate a current infection by adenovirus in a patient that meets the criteria for KD or that a patient with KD is also an asymptomatic carrier of adenovirus.",

The retrospective nature of our study and the absence of a shared protocol for microbiological diagnosis constitute the main limitations of this study. To establish the actual incidence of infection in patients with KD, the same microbiological tests would need to be performed in all patients, but there is not a standard protocol for testing and even the most recent guidelines of the AHA, from 2017, recommend individualised testing based on the judgement of the clinician and the symptoms of the patient.2\n",

In our case series, recent previous infections were associated with a lower incidence of coronary abnormalities in patients with a KD diagnosis, although the incidence of coronary aneurysms was not lower in this group. It appears that high-quality prospective studies will be required to establish the role of infection in KD. We hope that the prospective recruitment already underway though the KAWA-RACE network, which we encourage every hospital in Spain to join, will contribute to elucidating this matter.",
