We must find solutions to these combined challenges by taking into account the need for proper human nutrition and health, wildlife conservation, and environmental resilience. An example of a holistic conservation medicine program is well demonstrated by our work focused on camel health in the shifting landscape of Northern Kenya. In fact, the changing demographics of people and their livestock in this region may have immediate and long-standing negative implications for sympatric wildlife species. These changes demand a conservation medicine approach.",

First, with just one camel milk pasteurization plant in the country, Kenyans have little access to pasteurized milk. It has been estimated that 10% of Kenya's 40 million people drink unpasteurized camel milk.11 Because raw camel milk is a possible transmission route for many microorganisms, the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk in Kenya may pose a high public health cost in the country.11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Secondly, camels are browsers and have great ability to cover large areas across the landscape, which may lead to competition for food with sympatric wildlife.16 Lastly, there remains a shortage of veterinary education for camel health and a lack of veterinary support for camel production in the country. As a relatively new large-scale production livestock species in Kenya, and as a species often viewed as most closely linked with marginalized people, veterinary care and biosecurity for camels in Kenya significantly lags behind that for more traditional livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats). This lack of care has potentially devastating implications for productivity losses related to disease-associated morbidity and mortality, as well as an increase in disease transmission between camels, other livestock, wildlife, and humans. All these factors and challenges demand a conservation medicine approach.",

The invitation was from colleagues working at MRC and Novus International, an animal nutrition company with headquarters near St. Louis, MO. After researchers embarked on camel nutrition studies, they soon realized that little data existed on the health status of, and disease risks for, camels in Kenya. (This was just before Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS-CoV] was on the international stage with the first detection of MERS-CoV in a 25-year-old student in Jordan.21 See also chapter in this volume: An Overview of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East.) We at the Saint Louis Zoo immediately accepted this opportunity because the ICM had just launched as a new Zoo department, and one of the Zoo's WildCare Institute conservation centers had been focusing efforts on wildlife conservation in the Horn of Africa for many years prior to this time.",

First was the task of gathering literature on dromedary camel health and diseases, and to consider these in a conservation medicine framework. We focused on the diseases that were of most concern for camel productivity and human health, as well as diseases transmissible across the camel-livestock-human-wildlife interface. Dromedary camels may harbor agents with zoonotic potential (e.g., Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Rift Valley fever, anthrax) and/or those that may be transmitted only among camels, other livestock and wildlife (e.g., blue tongue, bovine diarrhea virus, Trypanosoma evansi).23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 It was also clear that some of these diseases (e.g., Brucella spp.) are difficult to diagnose in camels.Box 16.1How to Start a Conservation Medicine Program at the Livestock-Wildlife-Human Interface\n1.Do your homework and research all aspects of the study; including human, animal, and environmental truths.2.Reach out to others across disciplines to develop collaborations and partnerships.3.Find funding streams that will allow you to execute the program.4.Get the people-power to staff the various parts of the program.5.Use the program to educate the next generation of conservation medicine practitioners globally.6.Share the data in the scientific and policy arenas so your science is not just a hobby.7.Use the program to help others capitalize on your work and/or expand into other directions.8.Be flexible to modify the program as necessary based on political and biological realities.\nAlt-text: Box 16.1",

A proactive approach to camel health, at a time that camel numbers are growing across the Kenyan landscape, with potential negative impacts for wildlife conservation, is one example of how zoos may lead in the conservation medicine initiative to help address these 21st century challenges. We took an opportunity that at first glance might not have seemed a \u201cgood fit\u201d for a zoo conservation department but was shown very early in our work to be an excellent fit.",

Food security, and simple human security, will worsen in the short term, if not also the long term. We will have to be ready for these changes. As we strive for improvements in human livelihoods (e.g., poverty alleviation, conflict resolution, food security), it is imperative that the conservation of wildlife species be included in the equation if we are to properly address human, animal, and environmental health, resilience, and ultimately survival.",
