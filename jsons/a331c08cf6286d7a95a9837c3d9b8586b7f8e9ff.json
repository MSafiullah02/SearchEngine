            "text": "Most of the existing recognition algorithms are proposed for closed set scenarios, where all categories are known beforehand. However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called \"knowns\", and there are more we do not know called \"unknowns\". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to \"open\" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.",

We call the categories we know as priori the \"knowns\" and those we do not know beforehand the \"unknowns\". Enumerating all categories is never possible for the incomplete knowledge of categories. And preparing sufficient training samples for all categories beforehand is time and resource consuming, which is also infeasible for unknowns.

However, most of these approaches do not consider about unknowns or dynamically adding new categories to the system. In [9] , a discriminative metric is learned for Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classification on the knowns, and new categories are added according to the mean features. This approach, however, assumes that the number of known categories is relatively large. An alternative multi-class incremental approach based on least-squares SVM has been proposed by Kuzborskij et al. [10] where for each category arXiv:1905.01851v1 [cs.CV] 6 May 2019 a decision hyperplane is learned. However, in this way, every time a category is added, the whole set of the hyperplanes will be updated again, which is too expensive as the number of categories growing.",

And in the real world, solutions which further classify the unknowns are more challenging and have a wider range of applications. Abhijit et al. [14] proposed a SVM-based recognition system that could continuously recognize new categories in an open world model by extending the NCM-like algorithms [15] to a Nearest Non-Outlier (NNO) algorithm. But it is not applicable in deep neural networks, and the performance is much worse than deep neural network based algorithms. Recently, in the work [16] , Yang et al. have tried to handle the open set recognition problem by training prototypes to represent the unknowns. But the solution works on the assumption that all unknowns have sufficient labeled samples to train discriminative prototypes, which is not realistic. And the system needs to be retrained when new categories comes, which is time and computational resource consuming.",

Basically, prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to derive more precise features to better represent categories. In prototype module, prototypes are taught to learn the centers of knowns. And in prototype radius module, values of prototypes are further restricted to a curtain range by learning a radius for each category as a regularization item of prototypes. Both of the modules help to improve the intra-class compactness and inter-class distance of the feature representation. Then the correctly classified features of training set are projected into a different feature space by calculating the distance distribution between the features and prototypes. The triplet thresholds are learned based on the correctly classified distance distribution. Instead of detecting unknowns directly on the features, based on the statistic information of training samples, detecting unknowns based on the distance of prototypes keeps knowledge of the model, which has less potential to be effected by the outliers of training set. After manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process, new predictors are initialized based on the distance distribution of new samples and prototypes. Each weight column of the knowns is integrated to initialize the new weight according to the distance distribution. And the distance distribution contains more robust relation knowledge of the new category and knowns. Finally, fine-tuning the model with the manual labeled samples to incorporate new categories.",

The system needs to handle the unknowns during test phase. Recent works on open set learning [11] [12] [13] formalized processes of rejecting unknowns and classifying knowns in test phase. Among them, Abhijit et al. [13] adapted the concept of Meta-Recognition [23] , [24] to deep neural networks, and proposed an OpenMax method based on NCM by rejecting unknown categories in the activation levels. However, these solutions focus on detecting unknowns only and have not tried to further classify the unknowns. In [14] , Abhijit et al. proposed a recognition system that can continuously learn new categories in an open world model by extending Nearest Class Mean type algorithms [9] , [15] to a Nearest Non-Outlier(NNO) algorithm, but it is not applicable in deep neural networks. Therefore, the open set recognition with deep neural networks is still a challenging problem and needs more efforts to be devoted.",
