Clinical trials such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [ 5 ] and the Stockholm Diabetes Study in type 1 diabetes [ 6 ] , and the UK Prospective Diabetes study [ 7 , 8 ] and Kumamoto study [ 8 ] in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated that tight glycemic control achieved with intensive insulin regimes can reduce the risk of developing or progressing retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy in patients with all types of diabetes. However, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that only 50% of diabetics have been able to achieve a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level, as an index of chronic glycemia, less than 7%; therefore, the only way to ensure the long-term health of diabetic patients is to maintain constant normoglycemia [ 2 ] .",

Improved glycemic control is associated with signifi cant reductions in microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy [ 7 , 8 ] . In a meta-analysis, tight glycemic control has also been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease [ 9 ] . As a result, a clinical trial is currently investigating whether reducing HbA1C to less than 6.0% decreases the rate of cardiovascular disease and death [ 10 , 11 ] , which would be clinically benefi cial as macrovascular disease accounts for approximately 50% of deaths in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",

Proper glycemic control and attainment of other nonglycemic management targets (e.g., blood pressure, lipids, body weight) are essential to the prevention of long-term complications of diabetes and to the reduction of overall disease management costs. Two prime examples of such therapy are treatment of hypertension and early stages of diabetic renal dysfunction with antihypertensive agents, and specifi cally with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and laser photocoagulation of proliferative retinopathy and clinically signifi cant macular edema. The latest American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend a range of interventions to better improve type 2 diabetes outcomes. The ADA algorithm advocates a stepwise therapeutic approach that is based upon reduction in the plasma glucose concentration to achieve an HbA1C <7.0% [ 12 ] . Several therapeutic goals are recommended as summarized in Table 1 [ 13 ] .",

The goal of pancreas transplantation is to safely restore normoglycemia by the provision of suffi cient \u03b2 cell mass [ 18 ] . Transplantation of a pancreas is not a life-saving operation but it improves quality of life because patients do not need to inject insulin on a daily basis or regularly monitor glucose concentrations with fi nger sticks, and hypoglycemic unawareness is no longer a problem. The majority of pancreas transplants are simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, the preferred treatment option for diabetics with approaching or coexisting end-stage renal disease [ 19 ] . The benefi ts of pancreas transplantation are clear: improved quality of life, prevention of recurrent diabetic nephropathy, freedom from exogenous insulin with euglycemia and normalization of HbA1C, less stringent dietary restrictions, less frequent blood glucose monitoring and stabilization of or improvement in secondary complications. The major disadvantages to the patient are the operative risk, the need for chronic immunosuppression, and the inherent side effects of chronic immunosuppression [ 18 , 20 ] . The long-term advantages of this surgical procedure have to be balanced against the potential morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes, and the side effects from the long-term immunosuppression that is needed to prevent alloimmunity and autoimmune recurrence [ 18 ] .",

Notably, both host-versus-graft and autoimmune reactions were avoided. However, despite short term success, long term insulin independence is usually unsustainable. Several follow-up studies indicate that even with the rigorous application of steroidfree immunosuppressive regimens, only a small percentage of the patients maintained insulin independence. Noteworthy, 80% of patients evaluated had fewer hypoglycemic events and decreased their insulin requirements 2 years after transplant [ 24 , 25 ] .",

            "text": "The Edmonton protocol is limited by several major factors: the lack of a sufficiently large source of islets due to the scarcity of cadaveric pancreas donors, and the presence of persistent immune rejection as well as the potential for recurrence of autoimmunity. There is still a slow and progressive loss of insulin production from transplanted islets in diabetic recipients over time, as evidenced by reports that 30-40% of islet recipients may experience recurrence of autoimmune diabetes with re-acquisition of insulin dependence 1-2 years post transplantation [ 23 , 25 ] . A third limiting factor is islet revascularization, which appears to play an important role in determining the long-term survival and optimal performance of functional islet mass post transplantation. Rapid re-establishment of an appropriate microvascular system in newly transplanted islets is crucial for survival and function of islet grafts. Unfortunately, islets implanted at ectopic sites, such as under the renal capsule or in the liver and spleen, are invariably associated with markedly reduced vascularization, in comparison with native islets in the pancreas [ 26 , 27 ] . This impairment in islet revascularization accounts at least in part for the demand of suffi ciently large quantities of islet mass for restoration of normoglycemia in type 1 diabetic subjects. In addition, delayed and inadequate islet graft vascularization can deprive islets of oxygen and nutrients, causing islet cells to undergo cellular apoptosis and subsequent cell death, particularly in the core of large islets or in the center of aggregated islet clusters post transplantation. Moreover, a lack of suffi cient islet revascularization may also compromise the optimal performance of transplanted islets. Indeed, there are clinical data indicating that even after postabsorptive blood glucose Fig. 1 The process of islet transplantation (Illustration by Giovanni Maki) [ 22 ] Diabetes Mellitus: New Challenges and Innovative Therapies homeostasis is restored to normal post islet transplantation, implanted islets do not seem to function at optimal levels, as refl ected in their signifi cantly impaired glucose tolerance in diabetic recipients in response to intravenous glucose challenge [ 25 , 28 ] . Thus, it is of great signifi cance to defi ne the molecular mechanism of islet revascularization and develop therapeutic angiogenesis approaches to enhance the process of islet revascularization. Such approaches are expected to ensure adequate microvascular perfusion to islet cells and protect implanted islet cells from hypoxiainduced infl ammation and necrosis, which will ultimately improve the outcome of islet transplantation by reducing the donor/recipient ratio thus increasing the success rate of islet transplantation [ 29 ] . Antioxidant supplementation [ 30 , 31 ] , elevation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delivery [ 32 ] to islet grafts and co-transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells [ 33 ] The limitations and long term failure of the early transplantation therapies indicate that the procedure in its current format is not suitable for all patients with type 1 diabetes [ 45 ]. Intensive research is being conducted to look for alternative sources of \u03b2-cells.",

Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. A cure for the disease may lie in the development of techniques to replenish islet mass. Some researchers have already directed the differentiation of ES cells toward an endocrine ( Ins +) cell.

Recent evidence has suggested that adult \u03b2 cells are mitotically active and can replicate in response to increasing insulin demands. A complete understanding of the factors and signals that regulate this process could allow this innate ability to be controlled in patients with diabetes.

TDZs alter adipose metabolism and distribution and redistribution of tissue triglyceride from visceral stores, reducing levels of circulating FFAs apparently by sequestration in a less lipolytic subcutaneous compartment [ 105 ] . TDZs also reduce circulating concentrations of pro-infl ammatory cytokines that promote insulin resistance (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin 6) and at the same time increase concentrations of adiponectin, which has insulin-sensitizing and antiinfl ammatory properties. TZDs have also been shown to improve \u03b2-cell function, probably as a result of PPAR-\u03b3-mediated decreases in insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell fatty acid concentrations [ 104 ] . TZDs have demonstrated the ability to conserve \u03b2-cell function, delaying or preventing the development of type 2 diabetes in a highrisk population of women with gestational diabetes in the TRIPOD (TRoglitazone In the Prevention Of Diabetes) and PIPOD (Pioglitazone In the Prevention Of Diabetes) studies [ 106 , 107 ] .

However, the TZDs are more effective when used in combination with metformin, sulphonylureas, or insulin [ 110 -112 ] .

There are two types of cotransporters: SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. SGLT2 is the primary transporter in the kidneys, and selective inhibition of SGLT2 has helped elucidate the functions of these glucose transport proteins. Inhibitors of SGLT-2 block the reabsorption of glucose (in the proximal tubule) from the renal fi ltrate, whereas the SGLT-1 inhibitors suppress absorption of glucose from the gut; these inhibitors help limit the amount of glucose that is reabsorbed and retained in the body [ 189 -191 ] . The SGLT inhibitors do not interfere with glucose metabolism, and thus, they are being used complementarily to mainstream approaches to glucose regulation, such as with the PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, DPP-4 antagonists, and GLP-1 analogues. The majority of inhibitors being developed as antidiabetic agents are selective for SGLT-2 (Table 5 ), but there are some inhibitors of SGLT-1 and a mixed type of inhibitors. Most of the SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapaglifl ozin (BMS-512148), remoglifl ozin, serglifl ozin, AVE2268, 189075, 869682, and T-1095, are derived from the prototype phlorizin and structurally are glycosides ( Table 5 ). The potential ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce plasma glucose levels without inducing increased insulin secretion or sensitivity, hypoglycemia or weight gain could constitute a new approach in diabetes therapy [ 191 ] . They are also promising for other therapeutic uses such as in obesity because they cause net loss of calories from the body.",

Chronic administration of the SGLT inhibitor T-1095 prevented the progression of diabetic nephropathy and suppressed the development of albuminuria and the expansion of the glomerular mesangial area [ 193 ] . Whether this occurs through a modulation of the TGF pathway is yet to be determined. It is also possible that such selective inhibition provides renoprotection through benefi cial effects on glomerular haemodynamics, glycosuria, euglycemia and glucose toxicity of tubular cells [ 193 ] . The clinical importance of these fi ndings is currently unclear. A recent study showed a reduction in infarct size and edema during induced ischemia in the middle cerebral artery in mice treated with an SGLT inhibitor [ 194 ] , which suggests that SGLT inhibition can improve stroke outcome. SGLT receptors have also been found in human cardiac tissue [ 195 ] , but the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on CVD are yet to be determined.",

FGF-21 is produced predominantly by the liver and, to a lesser extent, also by the adipose tissue [ 146 -150 ] .

Another benefi cial effect of FGF-21 is its ability to reduce the secretion of glucagon from the pancreas, and to lower blood glucose and triglyceride levels when administrated to diabetic rodents and monkeys. Its administration in diabetic primates led to a sustainable improvement in glucose control without occurrence of hypoglycemia, a signifi cant improvement of diabetic dyslipidemia and a mild weight loss without any signifi cant side effects [ 148 ] . FGF-21 preserves pancreatic insulin content and \u03b2-cell mass when administered to diabetic mice. Moreover, FGF21 protects animals from diet-induced obesity when overexpressed in transgenic mice The function of FGF-21 in lipid metabolism and energy balance was recently emphasized by Potthoff and coworkers.

The inhibitory effect of AMPK activation on hepatic gluconeogenesis and its stimulatory effect on peripheral glucose uptake make it a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. This is further bolstered by its ability to bypass the defects in insulin signaling that are observed in these diseases. Most of the current AMPK activators act via an indirect mechanism, inhibiting mitochondrial function and altering cellular AMP levels. Several antihyperglycemic agents including the biguanide metformin, and thiazolidenediones such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, exert benefi cial effects on glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes via a mechanism that involves activation of AMPK [ 212 ] .",

In cultured cells, A-769662 activates AMPK in the absence of the upstream kinase LKB1 [ 222 , 223 ] , which may indicate that it is acting primarily via the allosteric mechanism. This is supported by observations that increased phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate, ACC, is not always associated with a substantial increase in Thr172 phosphorylation [ 222 ] . Importantly, treatment of ob/ob mice with A-769662 decreased plasma glucose and triglyceride levels, and reduced hepatic gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression [ 221 ] .

Treatment of cultured cells with PT1 activates AMPK via increased phosphorylation of Thr172 without altering the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio, and can occur in LKB1-defi cient cells, when it requires CaMKK\u03b2. In liver cell lines, the PT1 dependent activation of AMPK is associated with decreased lipid content.

Since then, a plethora of non-insulin producing cells that are not targeted by the immune system for autoimmune destruction ( e . g . gut K cells, hepatocytes, myocytes, muscle cells, fi broblasts, keratinocytes, pituitary and exocrine cells) have been used to transform into artifi cial insulin-producing substitute cells. As true \u03b2-cell surrogates, they should be able to synthesize, package and store insulin, according to the metabolic needs, as well as to precisely respond to the blood glucose levels and avoid lag time in the secretory response. To achieve this, the pro-insulin gene should be engineered in order to incorporate a specifi c mutated amino acid sequence recognized by the furin protease to produce mature insulin, since the \u03b2-specifi c endoprotease involved in the cleavage and maturation of insulin in \u03b2-cells is absent in non-\u03b2-cells [ 257 -259 ] . A construct encoding this engineered cDNA can be expressed after gene-delivery using cell-specifi c promoters, viral vectors or nanoparticles [ 258 , 259 ] . The use of synthetic promoters to regulate glucose-responsive insulin production may confer advantages to these therapies since they can partially override the unresponsiveness of these cells to glucose with physiological secretion of insulin. Indeed, a synthetic promoter library containing hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), a CAAT/enhancerbinding protein (C/EBP) response element and a glucose-response element was screened and it was found that the promoter SP23137 is highly effective on the production and secretion of insulin in response to glucose [ 260 ] . Still, this therapeutic approach faces other limitations. For instance, the fold-induction of insulin release achieved by these constructs is smaller than that of the islets and insuffi cient to normalize glucose after tolerance tests. Thus, one can question the capability of genetherapy-constructed nonpancreatic tissues to keep a stringent control over blood glucose concentration similar to the one provided by functional \u03b2-cells.",

            "text": "In opposition to ectopic gene expression of insulin, transplantation of pancreatic endocrine lineages reprogrammed from other cell types for \u03b2-cell replacement is also a possible and promising option. For example, it was shown that ectopic expression of human neurogenin 3 (NGN3) and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells triggers pancreatic endocrine gene expression, notably insulin, glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2) and somatostatin, as well as other \u03b2-cell lineage-associated genes [ 261 ] . The systemic delivery of a PDX1 construct to the livers of streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice, using a fi rst generation adenovirus therapy vector, was also shown to induce the activation of the endogenous pro-insulin 2 gene in the liver. This resulted in increased levels of serum insulin, glucagon and somatostatin and decreased levels of blood glucose that, despite the transience of the adenoviral constructs, lasted for a period of 4-6 months [ 72 ] . The ex vivo transduction of adult human hepatocytes with PDX1 also resulted in the induction of several \u03b2-cell gene products, and, upon transplantation under the renal capsule of diabetic mice, these cells did ameliorate hyperglycemia for prolonged periods of time [ 262 ] . Of noteworthy is the fact that transplantation of STZtreated mice pancreas with PDX1-transduced adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) signifi cantly decreases blood glucose levels and increases cell survival. Moreover, PDX1-ASCs were shown to be stably engrafted in the pancreas, to acquire a functional \u03b2-cell phenotype and partially restore pancreatic function in vivo [ 263 ] . More recently, the transcription factor NKX6 was also found to activate immature pancreatic markers, such as NGN3 and insulin gene enhancer protein 1 (ISL1), in human liver cells, and NKX6 in complementation with PDX1 was found to promote insulin expression and glucose-regulated processed hormone secretion in hepatic cells [ 264 ] . Another relevant study showed that NGN3/ Betacellulin (BTC) gene delivery and overexpression in the pancreas of STZdiabetic mice is also able to restore glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reverse hyperglycemia in these animals, rendering the neo-islets with a transcription profi le similar to that of pancreatic islets [ 265 ] . The treatment further normalized the hepatic glucose secretion, reversed ketonemia and restored the hepatic glycogen content similar to levels observed in nondiabetics.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes is characterized by infi ltration of autoreactive T-cells that mediate the destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells and, as such, several therapeutic approaches aim at controlling autoimmunity in this disease. One of these strategies consists of inducing and/or expanding regulatory T cells (Treg), more specifi cally of the Foxp3-CD4 + -expressing Treg (Foxp3 + Treg) population, which are potent immunoregulatory effectors that modulate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) responses [ 266 ] . Deregulation of Foxp3 + Treg has indeed been reported in diabetic patients [ 267 ] and described to result in systemic T cell-mediated autoimmunity in mice [ 268 ] . Administration of cytokines, such as IL-2 and TGF-\u03b21 has been used to manipulate T cell-mediated autoimmunity since they play critical roles in the maintenance of and/or differentiation of Foxp3 + Treg. This approach offers several limitations, including the half-life of these proteins in the serum and, as such, the need for repeated administrations. Thus, an alternative approach to this cytokine-based immunotherapy is an inducible gene therapy strategy, which allows for the expression of the transgene in vivo and obviates the need for production, purifi cation, and storage of recombinant proteins. Indeed, it has been shown that the intramuscular injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding murine IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2, followed by a short pulse of IL-2, is suffi cient to prevent \u03b2-cell autoimmunity and diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice by increasing the frequency of Foxp3 + Treg without nonspecifi cally activating and/or expanding T cells and other effectors cells [ 269 ] . Another study demonstrated that the transfer of the gene encoding the antiinfl ammatory cytokine IL-4, using AAV vectors, directly to the pancreatic islets of non-obese diabetic mice prevents islet destruction by blocking autoimmunity, mainly through the maintenance of Foxp3 + Treg [ 270 ] . Despite the benefi ts of the systemic expression of cytokines and other molecules by gene transfer to different tissues, the concern on the possible adverse effects resulting from this systemic expression on normal immune function remains unclear. These fi ndings, however, suggest that gene therapy employing vectors that encode cytokines and other immunomodulatory proteins may also prove to be an effective and safe strategy to manipulate type 1 diabetes.",

GLP1, an incretin hormone that regulates postprandial blood glucose levels, has been suggested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes given its insulinotropic action. However, this protein exhibits an extremely short half-life due to its rapid degradation by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV protease. Gene delivery of GLP1 is a way to overcome this problem and effective experimental therapeutics were indeed achieved. For instance, delivery of GLP1 cDNA, using chitosan nanocomplexes, driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, in Zucker diabetic fatty animals resulted in increased levels of plasma insulin and effi cient clearance of the blood glucose in glucose tolerance tests, when compared to untreated animals [ 271 ] . Moreover, in vivo expression of GLP1 mediated by dsAAV vectors induces significant pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation, enhances \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion, and signifi cantly delays the onset of hyperglycemia in db/db mice [ 272 ] .",

            "text": "Gene therapy using ACE2, which is thought to act as a negative regulator for the renin-angiotensin system that also exists in pancreatic islets, was also shown to be effective on glycemic control in diabetic mice. In 8-week-old db/db mice, overexpression of ACE2 in pancreas, through the direct injection of adenoviral vectors encoding ACE2 gene, showed improved fasting glycemia, enhanced intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, increased islet insulin content and \u03b2-cell proliferation, and reduced \u03b2-cell apoptosis, as compared to the control. These evidences point to ACE2 as a novel target for the prevention of \u03b2-cell dysfunction and apoptosis occurring in type 2 diabetes [ 273 ] . Improvement of health condition and quality life of diabetic patients may also pass by the direct treatment of diabetic complications, such as neuropathy, renal damage, retinopathy, impaired wound healing and cardiovascular disease. One of the best examples for a possible gene therapy approach is proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR). This pathology is the leading cause of blindness worldwide and is characterized by increased vascular permeability and retinal neovascularization [ 274 -276 ] . The eye constitutes a privileged organ to assess the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies, since it is non-invasively available for imaging techniques that allow the study of progression of neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered a central player in the regulation of angiogenis, and, therefore, has been proposed as the therapeutic target for treatment of late stages of DR characterized by neovascularization. However, currently used therapeutic approaches targeting VEGF in DR carry several drawbacks. Some of the approaches, developed and clinically tested to reduce neovascularization in DR, include intravitreal injections of antibodies that bind to and block VEGF action and its receptors, such as Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) and Bevacizumab ( Avastin ). However, intravitreal administration is associated with increased intraocular hypertension and infl ammation, whereas intravenous injection was observed to have signifi cant risks of thromboembolic events. Another disadvantage of these therapeutic approaches is the requirement of frequent and costly injections. Therefore, alternative therapies that silence VEGF, for example by the use of vectors carrying specifi c interference RNAs against VEGF, are considered as a new generation of more effective strategies [ 256 , 277 ] .",

Leptin gene therapy is one of the most exciting and promising approaches in this fi eld. This has been achieved by two different systems based on the transfer of the leptin gene to muscles using viral vectors or enhanced electroporation [ 288 ] . Intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant AAV encoding leptin in rats consuming a high-fat diet (HFD) have shown that leptin treatment reduces food intake and blocks the HFD-induced increase in weight, adiposity and metabolic variables. Blood glucose was shown to be slightly reduced but within the normal range. Treatment with leptin signifi cantly augmented uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue, indicating increased thermogenic energy expenditure [ 289 ] . Recently, it was also found that intracerebro ventricular and hypothalamic injection of recombinant AAV vectors encoding the leptin gene abolishes chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in animal models of diabetes [ 290 ] . Gene therapy approaches to enhance leptin supply locally in the hypothalamus, although unconventional, may offer an effi cient anti-diabetic treatment able to prevent and mitigate both type 1 and 2 diabetes [ 291 ] . Another example of a molecular therapy for obesity-induced diabetes relies on the hepatic gene transfer of CPT1A, the key enzyme in fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation, or its constitutive active mutant form CPT1AM, to high-fat diet-treated and genetically obese mice using AAV vectors. CPT1A and, to a greater extent, CPT1AM, enhance hepatic fatty-acid oxidation, reducing the liver triacylglyceride content in these animals. Obesity-induced weight gain, increase in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and augmented expression of gluconeogenic genes were also restored to normal only 3 months after AAV treatment, suggesting a protective action of both CPT1 forms against diabetes and obesity-induced insulin resistance [ 292 ] .",

However, glucose management remains a diffi cult problem. Thus, the interest on gene therapy approaches that might replace the ongoing therapies and avoid the development of diabetic complications is increasing. The preclinical gene therapy studies mainly aim at developing strategies for insulin replacement and suppression of molecular pathways underlying the loss of \u03b2-cell mass and hyperglycemic complications. Given the effi cacy of these approaches in animal models of diabetes, the possibility of bringing them into the clinic is becoming more real. Despite this, there are still several obstacles to overcome. One of them lays on the identifi cation of gene delivery systems that combine a high efficiency in cell targeting and gene expression with the least immunogenicity. To date, both viral and nonviral vectors failed to meet all these requirements. Viral vectors do not completely satisfy biosafety concerns due to their immunogenecity and to the random integration of their genetic material into the host genome, whereas nonviral vectors present a low transduction effi ciency and lack of cell specifi city. However, many efforts are being made towards the development of a good gene transfer technology, which, in parallel with the increasing knowledge on the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, makes gene therapy move closer to the clinic.",

The accompanying increase in the prevalence of diabetes-related complications and the occurrence of diabetes among younger adults, children, and adolescents is likely to have a substantial impact on healthcare costs, with cardiovascular disease and other chronic complications of diabetes accounting for more than one quarter of all direct expenses [ 3 ] . Patients with diabetes should be followed closely to ensure that they achieve and maintain both glycemic and nonglycemic treatment objectives. Given the loss of 80% of \u03b2-cell function at diagnosis of diabetes, as well as the 50% prevalence of preexisting coronary heart disease at diagnosis, a more aggressive approach from the earliest stages of disease is clearly indicated [ 294 ] . A number of new therapeutic strategies have been introduced [ 85 ] , and a large number of new compounds are in various stages of development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [ 295 ] and this refl ects the enormous impact of diabetes on public health.",
