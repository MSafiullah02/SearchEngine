The significance of good communications is highlighted in many accounts, and the media is seen to occupy a central role in the dissemination of information and formation of opinions and images (Berno and King, 2001 ). Nevertheless, not every public or private sector tourism organisation is in possession of a plan (Cassedy, 1991; Prideaux, 2003) and those that do exist are often informal and undocumented, addressing only one particular type of hazard (Drabek, 1995) .

Faulkner's (2001) exploration of the dynamics of a tourism disaster is commonly cited by researchers and he traces the disaster process through a series of stages noted in Table 1 . Although derived from evaluation of a natural disaster, the theory is agreed to have a broader relevance that permits its applicability to other emergencies (Ritchie, 2004) .

The epidemic centred on East Asia and locations such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan were amongst the worst hit. Fears of infection by the potentially deadly disease were widespread, aggravated by intense media publicity and speculation about its means of transmission, which is now assumed to be through vapour droplets. There is no vaccine or cure as yet, control depending on the identification and isolation of suspects.
