A good animal model of viral infection should allow many parameters of infection to be assayed, including clinical signs, growth of virus, clinicopathological parameters, cellular and humoral immune responses, and virus\u2013host interactions. Furthermore, viral replication should be accompanied by measurable clinical manifestations, and pathology should resemble that of human cases such that a better understanding of the disease process in humans is attained. There is often more than one animal model that closely represents human disease for a given pathogen. Small animal models are typically used for first-line screening, and for initially testing the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics. In contrast, nonhuman primate (NHP) models are often used for the pivotal preclinical studies. This approach is also used for basic pathogenesis studies, with most experiments performed in small animal models when possible, and NHPs only used to fill in remaining gaps in knowledge.",

Additionally, SPF and transgenic animals are not available, and molecular biological reagents are lacking.

Humans typically acquire and transmit the virus by the oral\u2013fecal route, although transmission by aerosol droplets may also be possible.2 The virus replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa, made possible by the resistance of PV to stomach acids.3 CD155 expression in Peyer's patches and M cells suggest that these cell types may be important during initiation of infection.4 Replication at extraneural sites precedes invasion into the central nervous systems (CNSs), when it occurs.",

Consistent paralytic disease can be induced in Bonnet monkeys (Macaca radiata) through exposure to PV by infection into the right ulnar nerve (at the elbow), resulting in limb paralysis that resembles human paralytic poliomyelitis both clinically and pathologically.12 As such, Bonnet monkeys can be used to study PV distribution and pathology and the induction of paralytic poliomyelitis or provocation paralysis.13\n",

Chimpanzees were exposed to a clinical isolate of Norwalk virus by the IV route. Although none of the animals developed disease symptoms, viral shedding within the feces was observed within 2\u20135 days postinfection and lasted anywhere from 17 days to 6 weeks. Viremia never occurred, and no histopathological changes were detected. The amount and duration of viral shedding were in line with what is observed upon human infection.34 A recently identified Calicivirus of rhesus origin, named Tulane virus, was used as a surrogate model of infection. Rhesus macaques exposed to Tulane virus intragastrically developed diarrhea and fever 2 days postinfection. Viral shedding was achieved for 8 days. The immune system produced antibodies that dropped in concentration within 38 days postinfection, mirroring the short-lived immunity documented in humans. The intestine developed moderate blunting of the villi as seen in human disease.35\n",

The virus targets dendritic cells and macrophages after a mosquito bite.95 Typical infection results in classic dengue fever (DF), which is self-limiting and has flu-like symptoms in conjunction with retroorbital pain, headache, skin rash, and bone and muscle pain. DHF can follow, with vascular leak syndrome and low platelet count, resulting in hemorrhage. In the most extreme cases, Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) develops, characterized by hypotension, shock, and circulatory failure.94 Thrombocytopenia is a hallmark clinical sign of infection, and aids in differential diagnosis.96\n",

WNV is recognized as the most widespread of the flaviviruses, with a geographical distribution that includes Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, Europe, and Australia.131 The virus first reached the western hemisphere in the summer of 1999, during an outbreak involving humans, horses, and birds in the New York City metropolitan area.132., 133. Since 1999, the range of areas affected by WNV quickly extended. Older people and children are most susceptible to WNV disease. WNV generally causes asymptomatic disease or a mild undifferentiated fever (West Nile fever), which can last from 3 to 6 days.134 The mortality rate after neuroinvasive disease ranges from 4% to 11%.131., 135., 136., 137. The most severe complications are commonly seen in the elderly, with reported case fatality rates from 4% to 11%. Hepatitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis are unusual, severe, nonneurologic manifestations of WNV infection.",

Another approach uses immunodeficient mouse strains such as SCID, STAT1 KO, IFN receptor KO, or perforin KO with a wild-type EBOV inoculum by intraperitoneal or aerosol routes.206 Mice are typically monitored for clinical disease \u201cscores\u201d based on activity and appearance, weight loss, and moribund condition (survival). Coagulopathy, a hallmark of filovirus infection in humans, has been observed, with bleeding in a subset of animals and failure of blood samples to coagulate late in infection. Liver, kidney, spleen, and lung tissue taken from moribund mice have pathology characteristic of filovirus disease in NHPs.

Clinical disease parameters may have a slightly delayed onset in aerosol models. Petichial rash is a common sign of filovirus disease and may be more frequently observed in cynomolgus macaques than in other NHP species. Dyspnea late in infection is a prominent feature of disease after aerosol exposure. A number of pronounced pathology findings include multifocal necrosis and fibrin lesions, particularly within the liver and the spleen. Lymphocytolysis and lymphoid depletion are also observed. Multilead, surgically implanted telemetry devices are useful in the continuous collection of temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and activity levels. As such, blood pressure drops as animals become moribund and heart rate variability (standard deviation of the heart rate) is altered late in infection. The most recently developed telemetry devices can aid in plethysomography to measure respiratory minute volume for accurate delivery of presented doses for aerosol exposure.",

Hamsters inoculated intramuscularly with a passaged Andes viral strain died within 11 days postinfection. Clinical signs did not appear until 24 h before death at which point the hamsters were moribund and in respiratory distress. Mortality was dose dependent, with high inoculums leading to a shorter incubation before death. During the same study, hamsters were inoculated with a passaged Sin Nombre isolate. No hamsters developed any symptoms during the course of observation. Although an antibody response to the virus that was not dose dependent was determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hamsters infected with Andes virus were found to have significant histopathological changes to their lung, liver, and spleen. All had an interstitial pneumonia with intraalveolar edema. Infectious virus could be recovered from these organs. Viremia began on day 8 and lasted up to 12 days postinfection. Infection of hamsters with Andes virus yielded a similar clinical disease progression as is seen in human HPS including rapid progression to death, fluid in the pleural cavity, and significant histopathological changes to the lungs and spleen. A major deviation in the hamster model is the detection of infectious virus within the liver.369\n",

One preferred variation on the models for testing the long-term clinical consequences of antiviral treatment is to use newborn macaques and treat from birth onward, in some cases more than a decade.454 Unfortunately, however, successes in NHP studies do not always translate to success in humans, as seen with the recent STEP study that used an adenovirus-based vaccine approach.455 Vaccinated humans were not protected and may have even been more susceptible to HIV, viremia was not reduced, and the infections were not attenuated as hoped.

Studies using intranasal, intraperitoneal, and intradermal routes of exposure showed that MPXV was highly infectious to prairie dogs. By using the west African MPXV strain, the intraperitoneal route caused a more severe disease and 100% mortality than challenge by the intranasal route. Anorexia and lethargy were common signs of the disease for both exposure routes. In contrast to the intraperitoneal route, the intranasal route of exposure caused severe pulmonary edema and necrosis of lungs in prairie dogs, while splenic necrosis and hepatic lesions were observed in intraperitoneally infected animals.481 Recent studies by Hutson et al. used intranasal and intradermal infections with west African and Congo basin strains and showed that both strains and routes caused smallpox-like disease with longer incubation periods and generalized pox lesions.475 Therefore, this model can be used for testing therapeutics and vaccines against pox viruses.",

There is a self-limiting acute phase resulting in a transient viremia that has the potential of chronic carriage.514 Challenge with virus in neonates leads to a chronic infection, while adults only develop the acute phase of disease.515 A closely related species to the woodchuck is the Marmota Himalayan. This animal is also susceptible to the woodchuck hepadna virus upon IV injection. It was found to develop an acute hepatitis with a productive infection.516\n",

Ideally, the experimental route of infection would mirror that which occurs in natural disease. To understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection, an immunocompetent animal should be used. The above characteristics cannot always be satisfied, however, and often virus must be adapted, knockout mice must be used, and/or the disease is not perfectly mimicked in the animal model.",

Many fields in virology are moving toward standardized models that can be used across institutions to test vaccines and therapeutics. A current example of such an effort is within the filovirus community, where animal models, euthanasia criteria, assays, and virus strains are in the process of being standardized. The hope is that these efforts will enable results of efficacy tests on medical countermeasures to be compared across institutions. This chapter has summarized the best models available for each of the viruses described.\n",
