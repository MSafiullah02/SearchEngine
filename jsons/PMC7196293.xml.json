The virus quickly spread throughout China and to many other countries/regions, with globally 1,353,361 confirmed cases and 79,235 deaths reported by WHO as of April 8, 2020 2. Most patients of COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but a few could develop severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or even die. In one epidemical report of COVID-19 by China Center for Disease Control (CDC), among 44,672 confirmed cases, severe patients accounted for 13.8%, and critically ill patients accounted for 4.7% 1. The crude case fatality ratio for critically ill patients was 49.0%, and the average risk of death within a 10-day follow-up was 0.325 for these patients 1. Another recent study revealed that the 28-day case fatality ratio among critically ill patients was as high as 61.5% 3. It is important to unravel the risk factors associated with severe illness and identify patients at an early stage who are most likely to have poor outcomes to focus on prevention and treatment efforts 4.",

These clinical biomarkers have been employed to predict prognosis in patients with ARDS 7, 9, 10 or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 11. However, they are not accurate enough to assess the infection and mostly involve invasive examinations, which may elevate the risk of virus exposure and healthcare-associated infection. Furthermore, the scoring systems like APACHE-II are subjective and time-consuming, which could delay the clinical management against the COVID-19 outbreak. A high level of d-dimer was recently reported as a risk factor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients 12, 13. However, the predicting performance of d-dimer has not been studied.",

CT assessment has been added as an important criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis and subtyping to the 6th version of national diagnosis and treatment protocols of COVID-19 in China 17. However, currently, CT of COVID-19 is often manually evaluated by radiologists, which is very subjective with large inter- and intra-observer variability thus unable to accurately and quantitatively evaluate the disease severity and is also time-consuming and inefficient. It is now recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for deriving quantitative CT features and precisely predicting the risk of lung cancer and poor outcomes of ARDS 10, 18-20. However, to the best of our knowledge, associations between AI-derived CT features quantifying pneumonia lesions and the risk of severe illness in patients with the emerging COVID-19 have not yet been reported. If AI-derived features from CT at an early stage of COVID-19 can be used to predict progression to severe illness, they can be particularly beneficial because CT is noninvasive and easily accessible and AI is time-efficient.",

The system combined a fully convolutional network with adaptive thresholding and morphological operations for segmentation of lungs and pneumonia lesions 21, 22. External validation with 383 axial CT images from 206 patients showed a Dice coefficient of 82.08% for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation (unpublished data from our other study with a focus on the development and validation of the AI system). By thresholding on CT values in the pneumonia lesions, three quantitative features were computed, including the percentages of lesion volume with ranges of -700~-500 Hounsfield units (HU), -500~-200 HU, and -200~60 HU.

Three CT features representing the lesion volume ratios of GGO, semi-consolidation, and consolidation were automatically quantified with AI. Our results showed that CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, could predict risk of COVID-19 patients progressing to severe illness. In particular, the changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed best in the prediction. Furthermore, CT features outperformed the traditional clinical biomarkers including APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer levels on day 4 and with the changes from day 0 to day 4 regardless of adjustment of age and gender.",

Such research design was not applied previously where only static measures of one time point were explored 12. In this study, we found that CT features on day 4 performed much better than that on day 0, which is consistent with our previous report that some COVID patients present dramatic changes on CT imaging on day 4 compared to day 0 15. Interestingly, the changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 showed the best performance in predicting severe illness. This observation suggested that the dynamic trends in CT manifestation changes are extremely valuable in predicting poor outcomes of COVID-19, an implication that might also apply to other diseases.",

For the patients at our Center, several treatments were adopted including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, antiviral treatment, antibiotic treatment, glucocorticoids, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Since all patients were treated in the same hospital, it is reasonable to assume that treatment variations might be negligible between the severe and non-severe groups.
