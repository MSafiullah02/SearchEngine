Most of cases are caused by viral infections and are self-limiting by only symptomatic treatments. Approximately 5\u201315% of cases in adults are caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and prescribed antimicrobial agents [3], [5], [6], [10], [19], [20], [21]. In contrast to the rationale of managements for pharyngo-tonsillitis, antibiotics are actually prescribed to a majority of adult patients at approximately 75% [1], [16]. The best way to manage adult patients with pharyngo-tonsillitis has still been controversial among countries [8], [12], [23], [24], [25], [34]. Optimal management depends on both the clinical likelihood of infections with S. pyogenes and the relative importance assigned to the criteria to avoid over-use and/or under-use of antibiotics with preventing complications. It is important to develop a clinical scoring system easy to use and to assess accurate clinical features of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis with special emphasis on infections with S. pyogenes in adults [7], [9].",

Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were determined by growth in chocolate but not in blood agar plates, catalase test, and requirement of X and V factor. Haemophilus haemolyticus (H. haemolyticus) were differentiated from H. influenzae by haemolysis on blood agar plates.

S. pyogenes were confirmed by latex agglutination with commercially available latex reagen (BioMerieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France) and bacitracin susceptibility.

In the current study, we defined causative pathogens and the severity of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis by a clinical scoring system in adult patients. Most of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were reported to be caused by viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, corona virus, parainfluenza virus, coxackie virus, influenza virus, herpes virus, and cytomegalovirus and were considered to be self-limiting [4], [19]. In this study, the frequencies of viruses in adult acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were lower rather than those reported in children, when we applied PCR/RT-PCR to identify four important viruses such as RS virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and hMPV from pharyngeal swab. The implication of viral infections might be low in adult acute pharyngo-tonsillitis [29], [31]. Bacteria were identified in 73.3% of patients studied herein. S. pyogenes that had been reported as an important causative pathogen responsible for acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were identified at 13.6% [15], [28], [32]. Other hemolytic streptococci were also frequently identified from the patients with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis. However, the pathogenic roles of group C or G streptococci in the upper respiratory tract infections have not been completely studied. The Haemophilus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. are more controversial. Isolation of S. pyogenes was closely related with the high value of inflammatory parameters such as white blood cells and C-reactive protein compared to isolation of other pathogens.",

Several clinical findings have the discriminative value in distinguishing S. pyogenes from other causes of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis. The ability of experienced physicians to predict positive throat cultures of S. pyogenes is moderate with estimated sensitivity and specificity ranging from 55 to 74% and 58 to 76%, respectively. In an attempt to improve clinical sensitivity and specificity, investigators have developed clinical decision rules based on constellation of physical signs and symptoms [13], [30], [33]. The Centor score has been the most reliable predictors for estimating the likelihood of infections of S. pyogenes in a patients presenting with a sore throat [9]. The score is calculated by determining how many of the following four clinical features are present: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, anterior cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough. At the usual clinical setting, the majority of primary care physicians prescribe antimicrobial agents and pain-killers based on the severity of illness [18]. Although the Center score is useful to infer S. pyogenes, the score is not valuable for diagnosis of the severity of the illness. A rapid antigen detection kit for S. pyogenes using a latex agglutination method also applied to determine infections with S. pyogenes. The test showed negative predicting value at 95% and relatively lower positive predicting value at 62% [37]. There has been a general consensus that negative rapid antigen tests for S. pyogenes should be confirmed by the culture test [17]. However, recent guidelines have suggested that confirmation of negative rapid antigen test results for S. pyogenes in adults is either not necessary at all or only if the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test is <80% [11], [28]. The rapid antigen tests has the lower sensitivity compared to a well-performed culture. Therefore, the importance of rapid identification of S. pyogenes is still controversial.",

Regarding to antibiotic treatment, it is important to discriminate causative agents such as bacterial and/or virus infection in acute pharyngo-tonsillitis. However, it is sometimes difficult to discriminate them in the usual clinical setting. The current study was also designed to evaluate correlation among clinical parameters such as clinical scores, WBC, and CRP. Viruses were identified in only 21 (9.8%) patients and there were no correlation between identification of viruses and numbers of WBC or levels of CRP.
