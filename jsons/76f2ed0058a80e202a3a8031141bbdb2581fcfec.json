This phase stems from the intrinsic structural heterogeneity of brain networks, i.e., the hierarchical modular structure. In this work, the Griffiths phase is studied in modified hierarchical networks with small-world connections based on the 3-regular Hanoi network. Through extensive simulations, the hierarchical level-dependent inter-module wiring probabilities are identified to determine the emergence of the Griffiths phase. Numerical results and the complementary spectral analysis of the relevant networks can be helpful for a deeper understanding of the essential structural characteristics of finite-dimensional networks to support the Griffiths phase.",

This has been observed in various processes such as gene expression [1] , cell growth [2] , and neuronal avalanches [3] . In different contexts, the critical point enables optimal transmission and storage of information [4, 5] , maximal sensitivity to stimuli [6] , and optimal computational capabilities [7] . Empirical studies on brain networks [8] [9] [10] , however, exhibit a stretched critical region. The Griffiths phase, characterized by generic power laws over a broad region in the parameter space, provides an alternative mechanism for critical behavior in brain networks without fine tuning [11, 12] . It is confirmed numerically and analytically that the structural heterogeneity induces the Griffiths phase, which eventually enhances the self-organization mechanism of brain networks.",

Modules in each hierarchy are grouped into larger modules, forming a fractallike structure. Previous work models brain networks with finite-dimensional hierarchical modular networks (HMNs) [11, 12] and successfully confirms the existence of the Griffiths phase using dynamical models, such as the susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) model and the contact process. The essential characteristic of previous network models is the hierarchical level-dependent intermodule wiring probabilities. It is conjectured that plain modular networks are not able to support the Griffiths phase, and disorder in different scales significantly influences the properties of critical behaviors [11] . In this work, the idea of a Griffiths phase is extended to other hierarchical structures encountered in previous studies of dynamical processes on complex networks.",

            "text": "As a complement to the computational approach, the spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian matrix of networks is conducted. A localized principal eigenvector of the network adjacency matrix indicates the network heterogeneity, which has been used to quantify the localization of activity on networks above the critical propagation rate in the dynamical model [24] . This concept has been applied to analytically explain the emergence of rare regions and the Griffiths phase [11, 12, 25] . However, the observation that a localized principal eigenvector is not necessarily the fingerprint of the Griffiths phase has been reported in highly connected networks with intrinsic weight disorder or finite-size random networks with power-law degree distributions [12, 26] . As an extension to finite-dimensional models, a class of networks is found here where the Griffiths phase is absent although their principal eigenvectors are localized. As the second approach of the spectral analysis of the network connectivity matrix, the Lifschitz tails in the spectral density of the Laplacian matrix is proposed to predict the Griffiths phase analytically. Lifshitz tails have been related to the Griffiths singularity in equilibrium systems [27] . For synchronization and spreading dynamics on networks, simulation and quenched mean-field (QMF) approximation indicate a connection between the Lifshitz tail and the slow dynamics [11, 28, 29] . In this study, the tail distribution of the Laplacian eigenvalues is presented to test how well it predicts the Griffiths phase in the SIS model. This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the structural properties of hierarchical modular networks, in which the SIS model and its critical behavior are studied; Sec. III reviews the SIS model and the spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian matrix, and the analytical tools are applied to all the networks considered in this work; Sec. IV presents the numerical results for the SIS model evolving in the networks; Sec. V concludes by highlighting The network features a regular geometric structure, in the form of a onedimensional backbone, and a distinct set of recursive small-world links. The node degree is uniformly 3. the significance of hierarchical level-dependent intermodule wiring probabilities for the emergence of the Griffiths phase and discussing the essential structural characteristics of the Griffiths phase.",

Eventually, this procedure constructs a finite-dimensional hierarchical network with a uniform finite node degree 3 and a diameter of \u223c \u221a n, which is denoted HN3 [16, 18, 22] . To construct a hierarchical structure that models the modular property of real-world brain networks, each single node x in HN3 is replaced by a fully connected clique that contains a finite number m of nodes, thus forming a network of size n \u00d7 m. Maintaining the structural properties of HN3, the self-similar structure, and the small-world connections, I propose two connectivity patterns between modules in the same hierarchy. In the first paradigm, the single edge in the original HN3 is now formed by two randomly chosen nodes in different cliques, which I denote HMN1. The second paradigm is inspired by previous hierarchical modular models [11, 12] . To distinguish it from HMN1, I denote it HMN2. Previous models share common features, hierarchical construction of modules and level-dependent wiring probabilities. Modules are grouped to form larger modules on the next level. They are connected in either a stochastic way with a level-dependent probability p i or a deterministic way with a level-dependent number of edges.",

In this work, I use the stochastic scheme to construct HMN2. As the size of modules in the hierarchical level i increases exponentially with i, the intermodule wiring probability decreases exponentially. In HMN2, for the first hierarchy, modules on this level are cliques themselves. Starting from the second hierarchy, the clique labeled 2(2j \u2212 1) is grouped with the neighbor clique 2(2j \u2212 1) \u2212 1 and 2(2j \u2212 1) + 1, forming a module. For the third hierarchy, the clique labeled 2 2 (2j \u2212 1) is grouped with three left neighbor cliques up to the clique 2 2 (2j \u2212 1) \u2212 3 and three right neighbor cliques up to the clique 2 2 (2j \u2212 1) + 3. Repeating this procedure g generations, the size of the module at the ith generation is m(2 i \u2212 1). The number of all possible stochastic connections between two modules is m 2 (4 i \u2212 2 i+1 + 1).

I apply the concept of the IPR to all the relevant networks to examine whether a localized principal eigenvector exists, which may suggest the emergence of rare regions and the Griffiths phase in the QMF approximation [11, 12] . As shown in Fig. 2(a) , the IPR of the principal eigenvector increases with the clique size m towards a finite value for different maximum generation g of HMN1. This suggests that the principal eigenvectors for HMN1 configurations are localized. Additionally, localized eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are also found, shown in Fig. 2(b) . For HMN2, I focus on level-dependent intermodule wiring probabilities, p i = 4 \u2212(i+1) and p i = 4 \u2212i , in this work. The backbone as well as the first-level intermodule wiring probability is fixed at 1/4, where the modules are the basic cliques described in Sec. II. Values of IPR are shown in Fig. 3(a) . The largest value comes from the network configuration where the single clique contains two nodes, and the probability is p i = 4 \u2212(i+1) . In this case, the network is statistically almost fragmented. Numerical results in Sec. IV indeed show the emergence of the Griffiths phase as a trivial consequence of the network disconnectedness. To examine the Griffiths phase in a connected network with a finite fractal dimension, the network configuration m = 3 and p i = 4 \u2212(i+1) is also chosen for the numerical simulation. For the stochastically constructed HMN2, as the clique size m or level-dependent probability increases while the other factor is kept fixed, modules become more and more connected with other modules in the same level, and the value of IPR decreases, shown in Fig. 3(a) . The regime over the parameter m and the level-dependent p i that possibly supports the Griffiths phase is narrow. It is not surprising to see that the localized principal eigenvector exists for HMN2 network configurations with a finite value of IPR. In Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), I illustrate the localized eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues in two network configurations.",

Simulations for each propagation rate \u03bb are repeated on 1000-5000 independent network realizations. The order parameter \u03c1(t) for each \u03bb is the average of all the runs. I also derive the effective decay exponent by fitting critical power laws \u03c1(t) \u223c t \u2212\u03b1 eff with the efficient exponent defined as [12, 25] Fig. 7 . However, the Griffiths phase is a trivial consequence of the disconnectedness of HMN2 as discussed in Sec. III B. For network configurations of HMN2 that are connected, I choose the case of m = 3, p i = 4 \u2212(i+1) , at which the corresponding value of IPR is sufficiently large. Since intermodule connections are established stochastically, there is a chance that all the possible intermodule edges fail to be connected. To avoid this case, at least one intermodule connection is enforced to exist by repeating the construction of graphs in the simulation. Numerical results for a connected HMN2 are presented in Fig. 8 . We see a nearly sizeindependent power law in a stretched regime of \u03bb. Comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 8 , as m increases while p i is kept fixed, and vice versa, the regime in the parameter space of \u03bb for the Griffiths phase is expected to become narrow until it disappears when HMN2 becomes highly connected.",

To solve the the conundrum between small-world topology and large-world architecture of brain networks, incorporating progressively weaker intermodule connections while maintaining well-defined modules is proposed as a solution [38] . In this work, I construct two classes of synthetic hierarchical modular networks that incorporate weak intermodule connections in distinguished ways. The first model, HMN1, builds the hierarchical smallworld connections into planar modular networks. The second model, HMN2, organizes the modules into hierarchies, and the intermodule wiring probability is level dependent.

As a further exploration into the Griffiths phase caused by the structural heterogeneity of networks, I present numerical results for two classes of networks. The results suggest the essential role of the leveldependent intermodule wiring probability in the emergence of the Griffiths phase. The first class of hierarchical networks, HMN1, is not able to support the Griffiths phase, although they satisfy the structural criteria, such as the finite fractal dimension, the modular structure, and the hierarchical heterogeneity. The second class of hierarchical networks, HMN2, is constructed to possess a hierarchical pattern in the intermodule wiring probabilities, which therefore require a delicate tuning to maintain a connected, finite-dimensional network. The hierarchical pattern of intermodule connections results in more heterogeneous HMN2 networks, while HMN1 network configurations are more homogeneous. This can be shown by considering the Lifshitz tails for HMN1 and HMN2 in Fig. 4 . The Lifshitz tail of HMN1 deviates from that of HMN2, and compared to HMn2, the spectrum of HMN1 is closer to the original network HN3 [39] . Although HN3 possesses a hierarchical structure, it is not sufficiently disordered to induce the Griffiths phase. The difference in the hierarchical patterns of HMN1 versus HMN2 significantly affects the phase transition and existence of the Griffiths phase.",

            "text": "As a complement to the computational efforts, the spectral analysis proposed in the quenched mean-field approximation suggests that a finite IPR of the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix can be considered to indicate the localization of activity that may result in the emergence of rare regions and the Griffiths phase under certain circumstances. Although all the network configurations of HMN1 prove to have a finite IPR and localized eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, only when the structural disorder of intermodule connections is sufficient as in HMN2 does the Griffiths phase appear. As a counter example to previous finite-dimensional models with localized principal eigenvectors that support the Griffiths phase [11, 12] , a class of finite-dimensional networks with a localized principal eigenvector is found where the Griffiths phase is absent. This raises questions about a more generalized theoretical analysis of the network adjacency matrix that applies to all networks considered previously and currently. Besides the spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix, the Lifshitz tail of the Laplacian spectrum presents a power-law probability distribution at the lower edge of the spectrum of HMN2 networks, while the tail distribution in HMN1 deviates from a power law. Numerical results confirm that the property of the phase transition may be related to this difference in the Lifshitz tails of HMN1 versus HMN2.",
