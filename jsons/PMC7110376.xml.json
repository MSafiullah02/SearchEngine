            "text": "Asthma is a syndrome characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction, which produces recurrent respiratory symptoms in the form of shortness of breath, cough and wheeze. Several factors such as genetic, environmental, dietary change and occupational exposure are known to predispose to asthma (Kino & Oshima, 1989; Beckett, 1994; Homnick & Marks, 1998; Cengizlier et al., 2006). Numerous viral infections trigger acute asthma exacerbations. Viral infections such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus have been found to be observed more often during severe exacerbations of asthma than during mild exacerbations (Johnston et al., 1995; Reed et al., 1997; Marin et al., 2000). In addition to these, the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in the pathogenesis of asthma was speculated around 30 years ago (Berkovich et al., 1970). Recently, the role of infectious agents, in particularly the atypical bacteria, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, in asthma pathogenesis has become an active area of investigation. Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are the pathogens that primarily infect ciliated epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages (Grayston et al., 1990; Dallo & Baseman, 2000). Considerable data exist implicating these organisms in the exacerbation of asthma (Huhti et al., 1974; Leaver & Weinberg, 1985; Seggev et al., 1986; Kondo et al., 1994). Experimental infection of mice with M. pneumoniae induced inflammation and increased air resistance (Hardy et al., 2001). These effects appear most clearly in mice previously sensitized to an allergen and subsequently infected with M. pneumoniae (Martin et al., 2001). Even though the progression of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been correlated with persistent infection with M. pneumoniae based on seroprevalence studies in children with asthma (Freymuth et al., 1999; Lieberman et al., 2001), the exact role and incidence of M. pneumoniae in acute asthma exacerbation in pediatric cases is still poorly understood. The clinical diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection is frequently hindered by a lack of specific signs and symptoms, although in the majority of cases increasing cough, malaise, low-grade fever and headache have been reported. The lack of a gold standard for the diagnosis of this pathogen still hinders the current understanding of their true prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory infections. While molecular diagnostic techniques, such as PCR, offer improvements in sensitivity, specificity and rapidity over culture and serology, the need remains for a consistent and reproducible diagnostic technique, available to all microbiology laboratories.",

This study confirms that infection with M. pneumoniae is frequently associated with acute exacerbations of childhood asthma as described earlier (Biscardi et al., 2000; Daian et al., 2000). Nonspecific parameters such as white blood cells, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (commonly used to measure the severity of the acute-phase response) were not correlated in this study as suggested by some studies (Isaacs, 1989; Korppi et al., 1993), and they were not significantly useful for therapeutic decision making.",

Previous studies have shown a 20\u201350% prevalence of acute infection of M. pneumoniae in asthmatic children. According to a report by Kraft and colleagues, M. pneumoniae was detected by PCR in the airways of >55% of patients with chronic and stable asthma. There were no previous systematic evaluations of the presence of M. pneumoniae in the lower airways of individuals with chronic and stable asthma (Kraft et al., 1998). Park (2005) studied adults and found 11.1% M. pneumoniae positive using the indirect agglutination method (Serodia Myco II) as compared with 4.4% in the control group. We found a relevant observation regarding the presence of Mycoplasma IgM in 22% of 150 children having asthma and only 4% of 50 controls, which is a statistically significant difference (P=0.002). These data were supported by the identification of Mycoplasma in 15 of the asthmatic children and none of the controls by PCR, also a significant difference (P=0.024). In a study of 119 children having exacerbations of known asthma, acute M. pneumoniae infection was found in 24 (20%) using IgM ELISA specific for M. pneumoniae. This study highlighted that M. pneumoniae may play a role in the onset of asthma in predisposed children and could be a trigger for recurrent wheezing (Biscardi et al., 2000). Chang (2006) studied 126 patients with asthma exacerbation and detected a 36.5% rate of M. pneumoniae infection using the rapid cold agglutination test and IgM ELISA (Savyon, Ashdod, Israel). In our study, out of 50 children having acute exacerbation, 19 cases (38%) were found to be positive for M. pneumoniae infection compared with 14 (14%) positive cases having no exacerbation on the basis of IgM ELISA. Of these 19 cases, eight were also found to be positive by PCR, which confirms the presence of M. pneumoniae in these patients. We also compared IgM ELISA in the moderate and the severe group of patients; however, no such statistical significance was found in M. pneumoniae serology (P=0.985).",

            "text": "Although the experimental evidence has shown an association between lower airway infection with M. pneumoniae and chronic asthma, clinical data in this regard are still scarce. This is because of the poor diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. Culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. However, it is a very fastidious and a slow-growing organism, and takes 2\u20134 weeks to isolate. In this study, we did not find any culture positivity. This may be due to many reasons. First, the culture depends on the prognosis of the disease. This may lead to differences in disease diagnosis, as we collected samples from patients who were previously diagnosed as having moderate or severe persistent asthma and were on a regular follow-up at the pediatric chest clinic. Second, the patients are also likely to have received antibiotic treatment due to clinical manifestations. Third, M. pneumoniae DNA usually remains detectable by PCR in throat swabs even after 1\u20132 weeks of infection, although the culture cannot be detected due to a decline in the bacterial load. PCR is the most sensitive test available for identifying microorganisms. Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be detected by PCR in airways even when cultures and serological results are negative. It may also indicate the presence of an organism in the respiratory tract in lieu of negative serology (Kraft et al., 2002). Taking PCR as the gold standard, the sensitivity of ELISA was 60% (32.9, 82.5), the specificity was 82.2% (74.5, 88.1), the positive predictive value was 27.3% (13.9, 45.8) and the negative predictive value was 94.0% (88.7, 97.9). Therefore, both molecular and serologic diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection with a clinical correlation can be used as a rapid marker to study its association with asthma. This study shows the importance of acute Mycoplasma infections during exacerbations of asthma. The use of macrolide antibiotics should be reserved for children in whom there is a high suspicion of atypical pneumonia as well as to ameliorate acute exacerbation of asthma associated with atypical pathogens.",
