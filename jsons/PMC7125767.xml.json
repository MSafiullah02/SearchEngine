Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype coronavirus, causes central nervous system diseases in rodents. Astrocytes are the predominant cells that harbor persistent viruses in the central nervous system (CNS) [16]. A previous in vitro study also indicated that the astrocytoma cell line DBT has a potential to establish persistent infection after MHV infection [10]. However, the mechanism of establishment of coronavirus persistence has not been yet well understood. Recently, the down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BNip-3 was found in MHV-infected DBT cells by DNA microarray methodologies [2]. In MHV-infected cells, BNip3 levels were significantly decreased at the transcriptional level, and this down-regulation was mediated by the fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane. This observation suggested that the anti-apoptotic effect by the down-regulation of BNip3 in MHV-infected DBT cells allows persistent infection.",

However, the mechanism of persistence in LoVo cell is still unclear. The monkey kidney cell line, Vero E6, is widely used in the SARS-CoV research because of a high sensitivity to the virus infection. Vero E6 cells express a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 [9], at high levels, and SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 causes cytopathic effects after 24 h [13]. We showed that SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells induced apoptosis via caspase-3 [13]. Several signaling pathways are activated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. One of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38, was shown to be phosphorylated and to have pro-apoptotic roles, including tyrosine dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 [13], [15]. Although Akt, which is known to act as an anti-apoptosis factor, was also phosphorylated in virus-infected cells, the activity of Akt is not enough to prevent apoptosis in the SARS-CoV-infected cells [14].",

            "text": "Persistent infection of many RNA viruses in cell culture has been studied. In these studies, it has been demonstrated that the establishment of RNA virus persistent infection in a cell culture is often involved in the generation of defective interfering (DI) particles and reduction of interferons. In the case of measles virus, persistent viral infected Vero cells produced DI particles [3]. Non-cytopathic (ncp) bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) does not induce type I interferon (IFN), whereas cytopathic (cp) BVDV is able to induce type I IFN [1], [6], suggesting that the different capabilities of cp and ncpBVDV to establish persistent infections relates to the difference in their ability to induce IFN [1]. Because Vero E6 cells are known to lack type I interferon genes [5], the involvement of interferon was unlikely in the establishment of SARS-CoV persistence in Vero E6 cells. To investigate whether DI RNAs exist in the persistent cells, Northern blot analysis was performed using a probe complementary to mRNA9 for detecting virus standard genome and all (m)RNAs of SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 2\n, we could not detect any signals of additional viral mRNA in the viral persistent cells at 11 days p.i. This result suggested that the DI virus was not involved in the establishment of persistence in the case of SARS-CoV. However, we cannot rule out a possibility that a small amount of DI RNAs appeared in the persistent cells. We measured the densities of mRNA8, 9 and 4, 5 using the LAS-3000 mini system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The amount of mRNA8 and 9 of the persistent cells are 81.4% of the acute infected cells. On the other hand, mRNA4 and 5 of the persistent cells were 12.29% of acute infected cells. In addition, a new round of infection did not induce cell death into persistent infected cells (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated whether persistent cells express a functional SARS-CoV receptor, ACE-2. On Western blotting analysis, ACE-2 was not detected in the persistent cell line (Fig. 3\n). Interestingly, ACE-2 was also decreased in the acute infection of SARS-CoV. This result suggested that virus particles produced by persistently infected cells could not infect other cells due to a lack of the receptor.",

As shown above, small numbers of Vero E6 cells survived and then continued to grow after SARS-CoV infection. These cells were infected and produced cytopathic viruses (data not shown). The majority of the virus in a seed could induce the apoptotic cell death of Vero E6 cells [13]. If some species of the seed SARS-CoV are involved in an establishment of persistence, seed virus with a limited dilution should not permit persistent infection. The seed SARS-CoV in the present study contained 2 \u00d7 108 plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml on Vero E6 cells. The seed virus was diluted from 2 \u00d7 102 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22121 PFU, and these virus suspensions were used to inoculate aliquots of 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in T-25 flasks. As shown in Fig. 4\n, no cell death was observed in cells infected with virus at a dilution of 2 \u00d7 10\u22121 PFU, indicating that viral dilution had been performed correctly. We found that 2 \u00d7 100 (=2) PFU-infected cells had fewer plaques than did the 2 \u00d7 102 (=200) PFU-infected cells at 36 h.p.i. However, all flasks other than those infected at 2 \u00d7 10\u22121 PFU showed death of almost all cells at 4 d.p.i. and surviving colonies at 7 d.p.i. These colonies became larger at 13 d.p.i.

Although a total of 115 clones was obtained, 24 clones showed morphological changes or grew very slowly.

Thus, growth rate was different among the persistently infected clones. This may be due to a difference in a number of survived cells among these 16 cell clones. Interestingly, 75 of the 91 clones failed to establish persistent infection. These results suggested that parental Vero E6 cells always produce a minor population of cells with a potential to allow persistence.",

            "text": "Recently, we reported that extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and Akt are phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and that viral replication was not affected by the activation of signaling pathways [13], [14], [15]. To clarify the signaling pathway important for establishing persistent infection, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with several concentrations of inhibitors of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt, and then infected with 2 m.o.i. of SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 6\n, SB203580 as an inhibitor of p38 MAPK and PD98059 as an inhibitor of MEK1/2 did not affect the establishment of persistent infection, whereas no surviving cells were observed following treatment with SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, or LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt. This result suggested that JNK and PI3K/Akt are necessary to establish persistence. Our previous study and Fig. 7A indicated that virus-induced Akt phosphorylation was not strong, and it was significantly down-regulated at 24 h.p.i.[14] Therefore, we concluded that the weak Akt activation was not sufficient to protect the viral infected Vero E6 cells from apoptosis. To confirm that the phosphorylation of Akt is necessary to establish persistence, SARS-CoV was infected to clone cell lines of Vero E6, which were showed in Fig. 5. At 20 h.p.i, phosphorylated Akt was not detected in viral infected clone cell lines 43, 48, and 80, which could not establish persistence in Fig. 5, while phosphorylated Akt was detected in viral infected parental Vero E6, clone cell lines 55, 58, and 65 (Fig. 7B). This result suggested that, at least, the phosphorylation of Akt in viral infected cells were necessary to establish persistence. However, Akt was not phosphorylated in persistent cell lines (Fig. 7A). The phosphorylation of Akt may not be necessary to maintain persistence after establishment.",

            "text": "In the majority of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), acute infection results in persistent viral replication and the establishment of chronic infection. One viral protein, NS5A, which interacts with receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2), inhibits the activation of ERK1/2 by epidermal growth factor (EGF) [19]. Moreover, NS5A interacts with PI3K (p85), resulting in the promotion of the PI3K/Akt anti-apoptotic signaling pathway [8]. This mechanism may lead to persistent HCV infection in vivo. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 expression, as well as the activities of JNK and activator protein-1 (AP-1), were increased in transgenic mice constitutively expressing HCV core protein [20]. The alternation of cytokine expression and the activation of signaling pathways by core protein may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in persistent HCV infection. Thus, viral proteins involve in the activation or inactivation of signaling pathways. Recently, the expression of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV was shown to induce the up-regulation of AP-1 [7], p38, and JNK, and the down-regulation of ERK and Akt [18]. Although these reports included results obtained in unnatural hosts in vitro, the N protein of SARS-CoV is a candidate for interaction with anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins of host cells. Thus, N protein may also play an important role in the establishment of persistent infection, even though a further experiment is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",
