In May 2003, Hilgenfeld and co-workers showed that the substrate-binding site in SARS-CoV Mpro is well conserved compared to those in two other coronavirus main proteinases (HCoV 229E and TGEV Mpro).4 In addition, they reported similarities between substrate/inhibitor-binding modes of SARS-CoV Mpro and the distantly related human rhinovirus 3C proteinase (HRV 3Cpro). Based on these findings, it was suggested that the HRV 3Cpro inhibitor, AG7088, could serve as a good starting point for modifications leading to an efficient and bio-available inhibitor for the SARS-CoV Mpro and other coronavirus main proteinases. AG7088 is currently under clinical trial for treatment of the \u2018common cold\u2019 caused by HRV Scheme 1\n.",

The synthesis of 1 in our group has proceeded via the highly stereoselective indium-mediated allylation reaction of N-protected valinal as illustrated in Scheme 2\n. Although syntheses of fragments similar to 1 have previously been reported, the synthetic strategy presented herein has two major advantages.5 Firstly, the incorporation of the 5-methylisoxazole-3-carbonyl group in the first step of the synthesis increases the efficiency by doing away with the protection and de-protection of the amino group. In addition, our synthetic strategy easily allows us to make modifications to AG7088. Hilgenfeld and co-workers suggested that most parts of AG7088 could be accommodated by the active site of SARS-CoV Mpro.4 Based on molecular modeling, only the p-fluorobenzyl group might be too long to fit into the pocket. In our synthesis of 1, the p-fluorobenzyl group is introduced in the final step, allowing us to generate analogues of AG7088 by simply changing the organocuprate reagent employed.",

Subsequently, NaBH4 reduction of 4 in THF methanol afforded \u03b2-aminoalcohol 5 in 99% yield. Alcohol 5 was then oxidized to \u03b1-aminoaldehyde 6 under Swern conditions. As \u03b1-aminoaldehydes are particularly prone to epimerization, no purification was performed on 6.6 Instead, the crude product from the Swern oxidation was used directly in the subsequent indium-mediated allylation reaction. Thus, crude aldehyde 6 was reacted with methyl 2-(bromomethyl)acrylate in the presence of indium metal to furnish homoallylic alcohol 7 in overall 66% yield (from 5) with almost complete syn diastereoselectivity (syn/anti\n = 98:2).",

Clearly, chelation of the \u03b1-nitrogen atom and the steric bulkiness of the i-propyl group cannot totally account for the observed selectivity in our reaction.

The interaction of the isoxazole ring with indium metal causes the transition state to be more rigid (compare Scheme 3, Scheme 5). Less puckering of the transition state (R\u2032 = isoxazole) is now possible (compared to R\u2032 = Cbz or Boc) to minimize the steric repulsion between the i-propyl group and the COOMe group. The transition state leading to the anti product is therefore further destabilized, resulting in the increase in the syn/anti selectivity from 82:18 and 87:13 to 98:2, respectively. In our synthesis of the L-leucine analogue of lactone 1, an improvement in the syn/anti selectivity was also clearly demonstrated (Scheme 4). The excellent diastereoselectivity in the allylation step makes our synthetic strategy of 1 very efficient and paves the way for controlling the second stereogenic centre in the molecule.",
