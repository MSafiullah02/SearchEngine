The side effects of a medication could be well known, but there might be uncertainty about the serious reactions that warrant reporting. Serious reactions requiring reporting are those that are fatal, life-threatening, disabling, or require hospitalization. It is always important to keep an open channel of communication between patients, physicians and pharmacists in order to ensure that patients are clear about the reporting process. Delayed reactions must also be monitored, as these reactions may not occur immediately after the administration of a medication. Delayed reactions may take several days to weeks to appear. ADRs in children and the elderly are especially important to report since they are more susceptible to the adverse effects of drugs. Elderly populations tend to take multiple medications for a wide range of comorbidities, and they may also have altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to medications. Patients are most affected by medications: therefore it is important to collect their experiences and analyze them. At each communication with a patient, whether in the hospital or community setting, we need to incorporate medication safety questions into our discussions [11]. ADRs are a major concern for patients when they start new medications.\n",

For this reason, patients might feel that they are a burden and may hesitate when it comes to reporting any side effects to medications. Patients must be made aware of the \u201c5 Questions to Ask about Your Medications\u201d [11]. Having these questions on a poster board in the pharmacy or hospital might help to remind and encourage patients to actively seek answers to any questions they may have about their medications. If patients are not comfortable speaking to their own health care provider about their medication concerns, there should be a staff member available in the hospital that could readily document their medication concerns and relay that information to a qualified health care professional. Improving the safety of medications is one of the most significant ways in which we can enhance the quality of healthcare. ISMP Canada is an organization put in place to advance medication safety and to ensure reliable medication practices in all points of healthcare. To further improve ADR reporting, ISMP Canada has made an anonymous reporting tool available to health professionals and patients, where they could report any medication incidents [9].",
