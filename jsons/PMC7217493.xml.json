Many of these investigations have focused on phenomena occurring at the top of complex networks [8], which constitute basic substrates for describing interacting patterns of complex systems [9\u201311]. While in a continuous transition the order parameter varies continuously from zero, in the discontinuous case it suddenly jumps to a finite value at the transition point, involving a macroscopic portion of the system, and this transition is commonly referred to as catastrophic or abrupt [12].",

Nevertheless, cooperative or synergistic interactions result in richer phase diagrams, which may include discontinuous phase transitions, and they have been a topic of intense research [5,6,14\u201318]. Cooperation and competition have been investigated in multispecies interacting models in distinct ecological contexts [19\u201324]. In particular, symbiotic interactions were recently investigated in a two-species contact process (2SCP) [24]. In the standard, single-species contact process (CP) [25], individuals lay on the vertices of a graph, which was originally a lattice, but the process was later extended to networks [26,27]. In the standard CP model, each individual can reproduce asexually at a rate \u03bb, with its offspring occupying one empty nearest neighbor randomly chosen, or it can die at a rate \u03bc (which can be taken as \u03bc=1 without loss of generality). In the 2SCP [24], two species, A and B, inhabit the same graph. The symbiotic interaction is modeled via a reduced death rate, \u03bc<1, at sites doubly occupied (by one individual of each species). With the exception of this interaction, the two populations evolve independently according to the standard CP.",

            "text": "Apart from its interest as an elementary model of symbiosis, the 2SCP is fundamentally interesting for the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Extinction represents an absorbing state, i.e., a frozen state without fluctuations of populations [28]. On regular lattices, it was found that the 2SCP exhibits a continuous phase transition in one and two dimensions [24]. However, the transition becomes discontinuous in the regime of strong symbiosis if diffusion is introduced [29]. The 2SCP was recently investigated in complete graphs and random regular networks [30], and it was conjectured that the nature of its transition changes at the upper critical dimension, from continuous to discontinuous. The phase diagram determining the regions of the 2SCP space parameter \u03bc versus \u03bb was determined in the ordinary, one-site mean-field level [24,29,30], which neglects all dynamical correlations with the assumption of statistical independence among the states of individuals even if they are nearest neighbors. This assumption is a strong approximation that can make the theory inaccurate even for high-dimensional systems11For a regular lattice of dimension d, the typical distance scales as \u2113\u223cN1/d. For these random graphs we have \u2113\u223clnN corresponding to d=\u221e [31]. such as complex networks [32], where the small-world property [8] resembles a mean-field (fully connected) regime. Dynamical correlations can be introduced using pairwise approximations [28,33] where the mean-field equations for pairs of connected vertices are considered. Despite being inaccurate in low dimensions [28], pairwise correlations greatly improve the theoretical results in the case of dynamical processes on complex networks [32,34\u201337].",

Each vertex of the network can hold at most one individual of each species A and B. So, the state S of a vertex i can be empty, represented by Si=\u00d7, occupied by only one individual of type A (Si=\u2218) or B (Si=\u2022), or occupied by one individual of each species, represented by Si=\u2218\u2022. The reproduction of new individuals of a given species happens independently of each other according to the standard CP rules [25,28]. A vertex i with one individual of type A, Si=\u2218 or Si=\u2218\u2022, creates an offspring of type A at a randomly selected nearest neighbor j at a rate \u03bb if j does not have an individual of type A (i.e., if Sj=\u00d7 or Sj=\u2022). Same rules and rates are used for the replication of a type B. Any individual in a vertex i spontaneously dies with rate 1 if they are alone (Si=\u2218 or \u2022) or with rate \u03bc otherwise (Si=\u2218\u2022). If \u03bc=1, the two processes evolve independently, but for \u03bc<1 they interact symbiotically since the annihilation rates are reduced at vertices where both species are present. The stationary 2SCP can evolve asymptotically to a fully active state, where both species coexist, or to an inactive (absorbing) phase in which both species are extinct. There are also two partly active states, where only one of species A or B is extinct, that can be reached for specific initial conditions (the dynamics in these partly active states is beyond our interest since it is that of a standard single-species CP).",

We consider both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. In random regular (RR) networks [39], all vertices have the same degree, ki=k, and connections are performed at random following the configuration model [40] avoiding both multiple and self-connections. In the Erd\u00f6s-Renyi (ER) model [8], each pair of vertices is connected with probability p. When the size of the graph N\u2192\u221e, its degree distribution is a Poissonian with a finite mean \u2329k\u232a=pN. Both RR and ER models belong to the class of homogeneous degree networks, where large deviations from the average value do not occur [31], whereas only RR has a strictly homogeneous degree distribution. The third substrate is the Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) model [38], in which the networks are generated through a preferential attachment mechanism [38] starting from a fully connected set with m0+1 vertices and vertices with m edges being added one at a time. We used m=m0 such that the average degree \u2329k\u232a=m can be fixed accordingly for comparison with the homogeneous case.

This dynamics can exhibit bistability with both active and absorbing stable stationary states [24]. So, we first analyze an initial condition having all vertices in a doubly occupied state \u03c12=1 such that this threshold represents the loss of global stability of the absorbing state, marking the lower spinodal point. We observe that the ordinary mean-field theory, although qualitatively predicting the discontinuous or continuous nature of the transition, is not quantitatively accurate as indicated by the dashed curves in Fig. 1. However, a far better result is obtained with the PMF theory, represented by the solid curves, presenting an excellent agreement between theory and simulations, for both near and above the transition point regimes irrespective of the \u03bc values. Increasing the connectivity k reduces the transition value of \u03bb as can be seen in Table I. Actually, the threshold will converge to the one-site mean-field value for k\u226b1 since this limit corresponds to the fully connected graph for which the one-site theory is exact in the thermodynamical limit.\n\n",

We observe that the PMF theory exhibits a higher accuracy for large average connectivity, as expected, since in the limit \u2329k\u232a\u226b1 it corresponds to the fully connected graph where mean-field theories become exact. Another important observation is that the PMF performs worst for BA networks when \u03bc is small while the accuracy tends to be reduced for larger \u03bc in RR networks. In BA networks, where hubs are present, small \u03bc will enhance activity localized in the neighborhood of hubs, which, in turn, are not sufficiently mixed for the regime of scale-free networks with \u03b3=3 [49]. More precisely, the star subgraph containing a hub and its nearest neighbors can stay active in isolation for long periods through a feedback mechanism where the hub activates its neighbors, which in turn reactivate the hub recurrently [45,50,51]. Since localization is opposed to the homogeneous mixing hypothesis of the mean-field methods, larger deviations from the theory are indeed expected in this regime. Another intriguing feature of the data of Table I is that the PMF thresholds are nearer to the simulations for the slightly heterogeneous ER than from the homogeneous RR networks, which becomes more evident for lower \u2329k\u232a and higher \u03bc. A similar phenomenon was also observed for the one-species CP on networks [37] and associated with the approximation k\u2248\u2329k\u232a, which would not be observed in a degree-based mean-field theory [9].",

We now also consider the loss of global stability of the active phase, i.e., the transition from bistable to active phases. For this aim, we consider an initial condition very close to the absorbing state with a very low density of doubly occupied vertices (\u03c11=0 and \u03c1\u2218\u2022\u226a1) in conjunction with the fully occupied state \u03c1\u2218\u2022=1 used previously.

The diagrams exhibit three connected regions corresponding to globally inactive (dotted region), globally active (empty region), and bistable (hashed region). An interesting difference with respect to the ordinary mean-field is a transition from a globally stable active phase to a bistable dynamics obtained either by fixing the infection rate \u03bb and varying the symbiotic parameter \u03bc or using fixed \u03bc and changing \u03bb, whereas in an ordinary mean-field theory such a transition occurs only for fixed \u03bc; see, for example, Fig. 3 of Ref. [30], which resembles very much the limit of large degree shown in Fig. 5(c). Indeed, the region with double transitions (inactive to bistable and bistable to active) at fixed \u03bb, occurring in the small \u03bc region, shrinks as the connectivity increases toward a fully connected graph limit as shown in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c). Triple points shown in the phase diagrams depend on connectivity, departing from (\u03bbt,\u03bct)=(1,1/2) for the complete graph (one-site mean-field) [24] to \u03bbt=\u2329k\u232a\u2329k\u232a\u22121 and \u03bct=0.501(1), 0.545(5), and 0.595(5) for \u2329k\u232a=103, 20, and 6, respectively. It is worthwhile to comment that phase diagrams with qualitatively similar spinoidals found in 2SCP with our PMF theory have been reported for other models with abrupt transitions on networks [52\u201354], with the difference that they were obtained by a first-order mean-field theory, whereas in the 2SCP model we needed to go up to a second-order pairwise theory.\n",

Moreover, understanding the behavior of these transitions taking place at the top of complex networks has become very relevant since most of these dynamical processes indeed involve interactions mediated by networked systems. In the present work, we investigate a simple model in which two species lying on networks interact symbiotically, i.e., the symbiotic contact process [24].

These PMF results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. Our findings provide an important example of the role played by dynamical correlations in cooperative processes on networked substrates, which is commonly not considered in other theoretical approaches. Pair approximations such as the one developed in this work can be used to improve the accuracy of phase diagrams observed in other related works [52,55] where first-order mean-field theory captures the qualitative behavior but analytical spinoidals deviate from simulations when the average connectivity is reduced.
