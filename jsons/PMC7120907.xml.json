            "text": "Air travel is a key mechanism facilitating the international spread of infectious disease. The increasing volume and ease of air travel promotes the dispersal of pathogens and importation of infectious diseases worldwide. This poses a significant threat to environmental conservation and public health (Golnar et al. 2016; Hatcher et al. 2012; Kilpatrick et al. 2006; Tatem et al. 2006). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus and Zika virus are well-known examples of this phenomenon (Bird and McElroy 2016; Bogoch et al. 2016a, b; Fauci and Morens 2016; Golnar et al. 2016; Lounibos 2002; Powers 2015; The SARS Commission 2006). The majority of processes that aim to address infectious disease threats are reactive in nature (Kilpatrick et al. 2006). In response to events such as the outbreaks of SARS, West Nile and Zika, researchers have increasingly studied the global movement of humans to predict and possibly prevent the emergence of infectious disease. However, this has proven to be notoriously difficult, and many approaches involve numerous assumptions and analyses based on incomplete data (Kilpatrick et al. 2006). Despite these inherent challenges, researchers continue to find new ways to provide necessary support to decision-makers (Golnar et al. 2016).",

Data on passenger and flight volumes have been used to model international connections and anticipate where infectious diseases might be imported. For example, Bogoch et al. (2016a) analyzed air travel volumes for travelers departing Brazil, to anticipate the international spread of Zika virus during the 2016 outbreak. Such analyses aim to help health care workers anticipate whether they may see travel-related infectious disease cases, and support public health officials in guiding resource distribution (e.g. for screening or communication campaigns) to locations at risk for local transmission if a case was imported. In fact, Zika virus was presumably imported to Miami from Brazil via air travel, and local transmission was initiated due to the presence of Aedes mosquitos and suitable environmental conditions (Bogoch et al. 2016a, b; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017).",

            "text": "The processes of infectious disease importation and spread are complex, but simplified modelling efforts can be effective (Golnar et al. 2016). While analysis using global air travel data indicates volume of travel between airports, identifying which airport an infected individual might use, or where a disease might spread after an infected passenger deplanes, remains a largely unexplored area of research. This gap can be addressed by estimating the area from which an airport attracts its passengers, referred to as its catchment area (Lin et al. 2016). In the absence of observed data, airport catchment areas can be estimated through a variety of models. While many catchment area techniques were developed for trade area analysis in retail geography (Boots 1980; Huff 2003; Huff and Black 1997; Reilly 1931), they have also been applied to model service areas for transportation (Debrezion et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2016; Wittman 2014). Existing methods can be classified into three main categories: deterministic, probabilistic, and customer profiling (Hernandez et al. 2004). Only deterministic and probabilistic methods are relevant to this study, since data representing spatial concentrations of airport users, which would be necessary for customer profiling, are lacking.",

Trade areas are polygons that have definite boundaries, and assume that all customers come from the defined catchment (Hernandez et al. 2004). Proximity-only models are included in the deterministic category and include circular buffers or drive-time buffers along a road network (Hernandez et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2016). Another deterministic technique calculates Thiessen polygons (also known as Voronoi polygons) around sites (Boots and South 1997; Hernandez et al. 2004). Here, every customer is assigned to the closest site based on Euclidean distance. Customers are assigned to only one site, and the mid-points between sites form the trade area boundaries. The Thiessen polygon method has been adapted to incorporate weights based on store/site attractiveness (Boots 1980; Hernandez et al. 2004). While deterministic methods such as circular buffers have been used to estimate airport catchment areas for the purpose of anticipating spread of infectious disease (Brent et al. 2018), they may over-simplify the problem (Cervero et al. 1995; Debrezion et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2016; Sanko and Shoji 2009).",

The two basic parameters of the model are attraction and distance, both of which have explicit behavioural bases (Huff and Black 1997). The attraction parameter represents the \u201cimpact of store size on consumer patronage for a given product when distance is held constant\u201d (Huff and Black 1997). For certain products or services, size (or other associated attractiveness measure) is more important to consumers, and therefore would more greatly impact their choice alternative. The distance decay parameter represents the consumer\u2019s willingness to travel for different types of products (Huff 1963). The choice set is another critical element of the Huff model. In a choice situation, there exists a universal set of alternative sites from which a consumer selects a subset based on their individual preferences. For example, some choice alternatives may be beyond a maximum distance the consumer is willing to travel (Huff and Black 1997). Specifying an accurate choice set is essential to minimizing prediction errors (Huff and Black 1997).",

            "text": "When selecting a method to estimate airport catchment areas, it is important to consider existing knowledge of how airports are used. For example, Debrezion et al. (2009) found that less than half of passengers at a Dutch railway survey chose their nearest train station (Lin et al. 2016). Leon (2011) found that airline travellers in North Dakota will not use the local airport but instead use the competing major hub airport located 250 miles away. There is general consensus that consumers are willing to travel further to reach a more desirable location, but it is difficult to determine the maximum distance they would be willing to travel especially considering this distance likely changes between regions (Leon 2011; Lin et al. 2016). These examples suggest that for the application of delineating catchment areas for transportation, deterministic proximity-only models may be too coarse (Debrezion et al. 2009; Leon 2011; Lin et al. 2016; Wittman 2014), although circular buffers have been used frequently to define airport catchment areas (Bilotkach et al. 2012; McLay and Reynolds-Feighan 2006; Wang 2000; Wittman 2014). Lin et al. (2016) suggest that gravity models (such as the Huff model) may be a more appropriate approach than proximity-only approaches, since they incorporate not only distance but also attraction. The main considerations of the Huff model align with what studies have shown to be the greatest determinants of airport choice (Ba\u015far and Bhat 2004; Hess and Polak 2005; Ishii et al. 2009; Leon 2011; Suzuki 2007).",

Ontario\u2019s 77 airports are also concentrated in the south. Figure 1 shows the eight major airports that had 2016 passenger volumes reported by Statistics Canada.\n",

This high proportion is indicative of a high volume of transnational migrants, and increased frequency of cross-border travel for personal, education, and business purposes (Levitt and Jaworsky 2007). This phenomenon adds to the magnitude of international air travel to and from Ontario. The concern of importation of infectious disease via air travel is especially relevant to Toronto, in which immigrants make up close to one half of the city\u2019s population. In 2003, Toronto experienced the largest outbreak of SARS outside of Asia (Bell 2004; Muller et al. 2006; Summers 2013). Bell (2004) noted \u201climiting the spread of infection by domestic and international travel\u201d as one of the interventions that aided in containing this outbreak in some parts of the world. The importation of SARS to Toronto via international travel is an example of where interventions failed and had a devastating impact on both human health and the economy (The SARS Commission 2006).",

It would be expected that people travel from much further to reach YYZ due to its high volume of flights, and because they might not be able to travel to their intended destination from smaller airports in Ontario. However, the Huff model estimated that subdivisions even at the northern border of Ontario were most likely to use YYZ. This is unrealistic and could be addressed by defining a distance cut-off in the model to restrict the choice set to airports within a reasonable distance. Additionally, the Huff model, as it was implemented in this study, does not account for the potential of flight connections.

This may be needed if the spread of a local outbreak through outbound passengers was to be forecast. Only the Thiessen polygon and Huff model techniques meet this requirement, while the buffering methods do not cover the entire study area.

The catchment area for YYZ, in this case, could be considered at risk for SARS spread.

Resources might be focused on the defined risk area; therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate method, and apply appropriate data inputs, to best guide this distribution of resources. Considering YYZ\u2019s high flight and passenger volume compared to the other airports, it may be possible that its true catchment area covers a large portion of the province, as estimated by the Huff model.

In the airport locations and associated passenger dataset obtained from Statistics Canada, some data were suppressed and at least one important airport location was not included for unknown reasons. In future research, Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) in Toronto, which serves approximately 2.8 million travelers annually (PortsToronto 2018), should be included to better understand its impact on the catchment area of Pearson International Airport (YYZ). Second, the comparison between results based on domestic and international passengers did not include travel to the U.S., since that is included in the \u201ctransborder\u201d variable. Additional analysis could be conducted to analyze results based on travel to the U.S. specifically, or the variable could be merged with international passengers. Third, the open-source Huff model tool did not have an option to apply a distance cut-off to represent a maximum distance that an individual would be willing to travel. Without the use of a distance cut-off, Toronto\u2019s YYZ received high probability for individuals living in northern Ontario\u2014in some cases over 1500 km away. The option to apply a distance cut-off would ensure a more realistic representation of travel to airports. Instead of travelling an unreasonably far distance, someone might choose to take a connecting flight from a local airport to a larger, more attractive airport from which to fly to their final destination. There was no obvious solution to including connecting flights in the modeling approaches, yet this would likely result in larger at-risk areas. Essentially, the catchment areas of larger airports would need to be extended to include the local catchments of smaller, connected airports, resulting in a network of airport catchment areas. Fourth, the methods did not consider airports outside of Ontario, such as US airports in Buffalo and Detroit just outside the Canadian border, which would likely reduce the estimated catchment sizes of some southern Ontario airports. Addressing this limitation would require expanding the study area to include parts of the United States. Fifth, we could not validate results with empirical data due to lack of access to such data. Validation is an essential next step. Primary data could be collected through surveys at airport locations or by collecting license plate information, or secondary data such as mobile phone data could be leveraged.",

Thus, it is difficult to pre-define the study area that predictive analyses would need to be conducted for. With an understanding of the different characteristics of each market area delineation technique, it is important to focus on the requirements of each particular use case. The airport catchment estimate should not only be as accurate as possible, but the technique must be manageable in situations where time and/or data are limited. This is often the case when there is an infectious disease outbreak, and analysis must be conducted rapidly to guide decision-making to respond and prevent further spread. In contrast to our case study, open-access airport and travel data would be more difficult to obtain globally, though options exist to purchase such datasets (e.g. from the International Air Transport Association). If a distance cut-off were incorporated to refine the results, the Huff model provides a balance between ease-of-execution and validity of results, so that catchment areas could be estimated rapidly and produce valid results to properly guide decision-makers when responding to infectious disease threats.",
