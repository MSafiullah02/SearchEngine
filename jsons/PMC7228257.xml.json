Understanding these movements is a key component of disease prevention and control. Social network analysis (SNA) has been utilized to investigate the potential for disease transmission through animal movements; determine the magnitude and control of potential epidemics (Dube, Ribble, Kelton, & McNab, 2009; Gates & Woolhouse, 2015); predict the infection risk for premises (Bigras\u2010Poulin et al., 2006); and guide risk\u2010based surveillance approaches and decisions (e.g. early detection) (Kiss, Green, & Kao, 2006; Martin et al., 2011). Besides movement of live animals, attention has also focused on the network of indirect contacts between farms (Brennan, Kemp, & Christley, 2008; Dent, Kao, Kiss, Hyder, & Arnold, 2008; Rossi et al., 2017), because many animal diseases, including swine influenza (SI) and African swine fever (ASF), can spread indirectly via contaminated fomites (e.g. vehicles, equipment and clothing) and people (Grontvedt et al., 2013; Lauterbach et al., 2018). A previous study in southern China highlighted the use of poor biosecurity practices by local pig farmers when selling pigs as less than half of the farms implemented an \u2018all\u2010in\u2010all\u2010out\u2019 practice for pigs in a pen; thirty per cent of buyers entered a piggery to select and collect pigs; and only about half of the surveyed farms always required all external vehicles to be disinfected (Li et al., 2019). These behaviours in pig trade have the potential to facilitate the spread of contagious diseases via live pig trade networks.",

            "text": "Although pigs are usually transported directly from farms to slaughterhouses in most provinces of China, there is trade of live pigs through wholesale markets in Guangdong Province, in south China. Estimations have suggested that around 10% of the pigs slaughtered in the province, were traded through wholesale live pig markets (P. Chen, personal communication, July 10, 2018). Home slaughter of pigs is illegal in Guangdong Province and is rarely considered to occur in the field (People's Government of Guangdong Province, 2011). Small abattoirs in townships offer a slaughter service at a cost of 30 RMB (4.5 USD) per head. Abattoirs with larger slaughter capacity are usually located in suburban areas of a city. All wholesale live pig markets in this province are located in the cities of Guangzhou and Foshan, and it is estimated that approximately 5.7 million pigs are supplied annually to these two cities via live pig markets (P. Chen, personal communication, July 10, 2018). Approximately 90% of the pigs traded at these markets originate from piggeries located within Guangdong Province (P. Chen, personal communication, July 10, 2018). In 2015, small piggeries, that sell <50 pigs in a year, contributed 87.5% of the total number of pig farms in Guangdong Province (Statistic Beurau of Guangdong Province, 2016). The live pig traders or their employees usually visit pig farms in several counties every day to collect pigs for subsequent resale in the markets. These pigs are transported to the markets in trucks either owned or hired by the traders, and which usually carry pigs sourced from multiple piggeries. However, some pig farmers transport their pigs directly to the live pig markets. At the markets, the traders rent pens which are used to contain pigs purchased from multiple pig farms. The pens are separated from each other by either an open metal fence or a low brick wall (approximately 1 m high). Pigs are then purchased by butchers/meat sellers. Some pig traders will offer a \u2018slaughter and delivery service\u2019 where the pigs selected by the butchers are identified and sent to a slaughterhouse, with the carcass subsequently delivered directly to the meat seller's stall. The meat sellers' stalls are not in the live pig trade markets and are often in a vegetable and meat market near residential areas. No pork is sold in these live pig trade markets. Pigs may stay in the markets for hours to days until being sent to slaughterhouses.",

For example, the first case of FMD subtype A infection in a pig was found in the province in 2013 (OIE, 2018) and in 2018, a novel coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus, was identified as the pathogen causing high mortality in four commercial pig farms in the province (Zhou et al., 2018). There are also a variety of influenza strains circulating in pigs in the province and surveillance data indicates that the gene reassortment among local isolates is far more complicated than that among isolates from other Chinese provinces (Cao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2011; Ninomiya, Takada, Okazaki, Shortridge, & Kida, 2002; Xie et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2014).",

However, live pig trade patterns in the markets have rarely been described and the characteristics of these networks and their impact on disease spread and control strategies to adopt have never been studied in China. This study was designed to investigate the indirect contact network between source counties through the movement of live pigs via these wholesale markets. This study aims to provide evidence for improved decision making and resource allocation to areas for prevention and control of disease. Trade patterns in live pig markets were described, and properties of the networks in January (winter, busy trade season) and in June (summer, quiet trade season) were compared to study the stability of the live pig market trade network in different months/seasons. Different strategies were compared to illustrate the benefit of taking a risk\u2010based intervention to constrain potential disease spread through this network. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted interventions to control disease spread through the live pig market trade network.",

In China, each batch of pigs requires a pig health certificate provided by the local official veterinarians. The pig health certificates are paper\u2010based. The farmers give the pig health certificates to traders, so the traders can transport pigs to markets or slaughterhouses. If traders did not offer pig health certificates, the markets or slaughterhouses will not accept their pigs (People's Government of Guangdong Province, 2011). Market managers are required by local authorities to collect these health certificates and to keep them for at least one year. Three of these markets (Jiahe market\u2014market 1; Furong market\u2014market 2; and Baiyun market\u2014market 3) are located in Guangzhou city, and Wufeng market (market 4) is situated in Foshan city. In total, 14,118 trade records from January (8,001) to June (6,117) 2016 were collected. The data cover trade events from all traders in all four wholesale live pig markets. These markets are open every day of the year, except for a short closure (1\u20132 weeks) during the spring festival. Sheep, goat and cattle were also traded in Furong market, while all other markets only traded pigs. Data for each batch (a truckload of pigs that had been collected from one or more farms from the same county) were collected, including the source counties of the pigs (91.3% of the data had source counties recorded), the loading date, number of pigs, destination markets and the destination pig pen(s) at the market (76.1% of the data recorded the destination pen, which is usually owned by one trader).",

The total number of pigs traded in each month, the average size of a batch, the number of pig pens and the source counties of the pigs were also calculated for each market. A batch was a group of pigs from one or more farms transported to the live markets on one truck, irrespective of the number. A county that contributed at least 20 batches in one month was classified as a major supply county. The total number of batches to the markets from these major source counties was compared to check the stability of supply for January and June.",

The study unit in the network was source county and trader. Firstly, the network was established as an undirected bipartite network, and the number of batches was set as the link weight. The source and destination nodes were set as the source counties and the pens (each pen owned by a trader) in the markets, respectively. The 2\u2010mode network was then transformed into a 1\u2010mode network by removing the pens, to focus on the network between source counties.",

R0 was investigated across the networks. R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a case during its infectious period in a susceptible population (Lin & Vandendriessche, 1992). R0 is affected by the characteristics of the pathogen (e.g. pathogenicity and environmental resistance of the pathogen). It is also determined by the method and frequency of contact between units of interest. In this study, we focused on the impact of the trader network on a disease transmitted among supply counties. To illustrate the impact of the network structure on the spread of diseases, we compared the R0s of existed networks in different seasons to simulate random networks with the same number of nodes. \u2018R0(network)/R0(random)\u2019 was calculated for the two static networks in January and June 2016 (Marquetoux, Stevenson, Wilson, Ridler, & Heuer, 2016).",

The degree, betweenness and closeness of each node were calculated. The correlations between the nodes' scores in degrees and betweenness and closeness were checked using Pearson's correlation test. A map was developed to show the degrees of source counties in this network. The distributions of degrees, betweenness and closeness of the nodes in the combined network were illustrated with figures. To illustrate the impact of the key players on the potential magnitude of epidemics spreading through this network, the methodology of Marquetoux et al. (2016) was used to compare the decrease of the GWCC in the network with different strategies. One involved randomly removing a node in the network, while the others involved deleting the nodes in sequence according to their scores of three indicators of centrality: degree, betweenness and closeness.",

This indicates that they are potentially key players in a network, which should be targeted for disease control strategies. The connectivity was measured with different parameters in this study: degree, betweenness and closeness. Most of the counties with the highest degree were located in central, northern and western Guangdong. It is worth noting that the counties with high degree scores also had high betweenness and closeness values. These counties had larger pig populations than counties with lower connectivity. Thus, they are more likely to supply pigs to many markets at the same time. This result indicates that it will be very challenging to stop pig movement in counties with higher connectivity, during an emergency response to an epidemic. We suggest that besides movement suspension, other control measures such as emergency vaccination, enhanced quarantine, promotion of better biosecurity practices in the trading sector and education programs should also be implemented during emergency disease responses.",

For example, the transmission of ASF in China (Ge et al., 2018; Normile, 2018; Wang, Sun, & Qiu, 2018) has been the result of long\u2010distance movement of live pigs allowing the epidemic to propagate (Wang et al., 2018). Our findings show that the supply counties of the live pig markets in Guangdong Province included, not only counties inside this province but also counties from Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu and Henan provinces. Animal health authorities in Guangdong Province should pay more attention to outbreaks in these provinces, especially Hunan and Guangxi. These provinces contributed more pigs to the live pig markets in Guangdong Province than did other provinces (excluding Guangdong Province) and some counties in the middle of Hunan and east Guangxi had relatively high connectivity in the live pig market trading network. For early detection of ASF in Guangdong Province, counties inside/adjacent to Guangzhou and to the north and south\u2010west of the province should also be targeted for active surveillance. Control measures against ASF adopted in China have included mass field screening of pigs, widespread sampling and testing, movement restrictions, thorough cleaning and disinfection of trucks transporting pigs, and registration of live pig traders (Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs, 2018). However, these measures can be a big burden for local governments. Social network analysis on animal movement can contribute to improving the efficiency of control measures when resources are limited by targeting priority areas. The current results indicate that, in an emergency response where often there are limited diagnostic and human resources, targeted surveillance and intervention would be a better strategy to control the potential magnitude of an outbreak among the source counties included in the market trading network. In this study, we found that if we isolated the 45 counties with higher connectivity (e.g. by movement restriction or enhanced quarantine), the magnitude of a potential epidemic could decrease substantially, in contrast to conducting control measures across the same number of randomly selected counties (10 vs. 70).",

Influenza is one of the most significant zoonotic diseases (Bowman et al., 2014; Lauterbach et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2015; Myers et al., 2006). Pigs can be infected by swine influenza strains, as well as some human strains, and genetic reassortment between swine and human influenza strains may facilitate the evolution of new strains circulating in pigs or even pandemic strains in humans (Kuntz\u2010Simon & Madec, 2009; Rajao et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 1999). A recent study indicated a poor level of biosecurity being adopted by pig farmers in Guangdong when selling pigs (Li et al., 2019). There is evidence to indicate that workers on pig farms and markets in China have a higher risk of acquiring SI influenza than the general population (Ma et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2014). To improve the efficiency of surveillance of SI in Guangdong, those traders in the markets with more contacts to different counties and those pig farms within the counties with higher connectivity in the network should be targeted for human influenza and SI surveillance, respectively.",

The average path length in the combined static network was <2, which means that any two counties in the network can be connected via just another county. Interestingly, the average path length was shorter in the trade network of January than that in June, which illustrates that it would be easier for a pathogen to spread among nodes in this trade network in January than in June. Furthermore, the lower temperature in January could preferentially influence the survival of pathogens in the environment (Botner & Belsham, 2012).

We evaluated the consistency of the live pig market trading network by comparing the source counties in January and June 2016. The links among the dominant source counties and the live pig pens were stable in the different months, although there were 55 more counties from neighbouring provinces involved in pig supply in June. However, these newly added counties contributed <2% of the pigs, and the trade frequency of these counties was low. When we transformed the 2\u2010mode network into the 1\u2010mode network, many of these counties became isolated nodes. We decided to simplify the network by deleting these nodes, because these counties which only occasionally supply pigs should have a low impact on the spread of disease between counties. It was not surprising that more pigs were traded in these markets in January than in June (504,570 vs. 442,315) because January is close to the Chinese Spring Festival and demand for meat increases before this festival (Pan et al., 2016). The increase in the number of source counties in June may be due to the change in the pig density in Guangdong Province arising from a policy to restrict the number of pig farms in the province implemented in 2014, resulting in some farms being forced to close or to relocate to other counties (China State Council, 2013). As displayed in Figure 2, Baiyun (suburban area of Guangzhou city) and Sanshui (suburban area of Zhongshan city) supplied many pigs in January 2016, but the numbers supplied in June 2016 decreased dramatically. During our field investigation, we were told that many pig farms in these areas were closed in 2016 because of concerns arising from their environmental impact. Another reason could be price changes in neighbouring provinces, which may have provided incentives for traders to collect pigs from more distant counties. A study on live poultry movement in China reported that when the price of poultry changed in neighbouring provinces, the direction of movement of live poultry also changed accordingly (Li et al., 2018). It is worth noting that the increased supply counties in this network resulted in a change in the structure of the local market trade network. Newly produced communities can result in new disease circulating directions between counties. We suggest that local veterinary authorities should pay attention to the impact of policy or price changes on livestock movement. Monitoring the changes in the structure of this market trade network is needed.",

Firstly, the \u2018removal of the counties from this network\u2019 cannot be totally achieved because illegal trade could be present. However, animal movement suspension has been implemented on several occasions in China (e.g. emergency responses for PPR and ASF) (Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs, 2019) and is required by the animal health law in China (China State Council, 2015). Although it is impossible to prevent all illegal trade, suspending legal trade would dramatically reduce the trade volume from selected counties. Besides movement restriction, other control measures, such as emergency vaccination, intensive screening for cases, enhancing biosecurity within the trading sector and implementing education programs, could also reduce disease risk in targeted counties. These control measures could also result in the targeted areas being \u2018removed\u2019 from the network in terms of spreading disease. Secondly, in reality authorities would not randomly select places to implement an emergency response. The places are usually selected according to their current infection status or potential for infection. However, early detection of an epidemic in a county can be challenging, especially for an exotic disease (Liu et al., 2019), and choosing counties based on convenience is unlikely to be effective. We used randomness to model these non\u2010targeted scenarios, and we believe that our model, even with its limitations, has offered new insights for decision\u2010makers to understand the disease risk in places before an epidemic occurs. The same methodology has been used in another similar study (Marquetoux et al., 2016). It is worth noting that this study only focused on the pig movement network through local wholesale markets. Pigs are also traded through other systems in this province. For example, breeding pigs are often traded directly between pig farms, and weaners are often moved from breeding farms to fattening farms. Further studies on the movement of live pigs among local farms are needed.",

These data would be critical in tracing livestock movement during emergency responses and would favour SNA being used to inform the establishment of a proper disease control contingency plan. However, livestock trade (source and destination) is poorly recorded in many livestock markets in China. The most common source of live pig movement records in China is the official health certification of the traded pigs, which has limitations. Firstly, the certification record often lacks the name and location of the source farm, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to effectively trace back to farms/animals in outbreak investigations. Secondly, data from the health certification system are not shared between provincial animal health authorities, even though live pig movements often cross provincial boundaries. A more comprehensive national database should be established in China. Detailed information on the location, species, farm size, type of source piggery (breeding, fattening, etc.) and livestock movements should be recorded and updated in a timely manner.",
