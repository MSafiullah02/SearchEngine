As other pandemics observed during the time, COVID-19 has been caused a lot of fatal victims. The emergence of diverse epidemics led the scientific community to developed diverse methods to study and analyze the evolution of diseases. The classical compartmentals mathematical models are usually the starting point for the study of epidemics [2, 3] .",

To avoid the rapid growth of the number of cases, the Rio de Janeiro state government implemented some policies of social isolation. Such policies were started at March 17, 2020, and of course they lead some days to produce effective results. The government did not imposed a lockdown, they suggested people to stay in home, schools and universities were closed, public events were banning, and only the essential activities are in progress, for example delivery of food, drugstories, supermarkets, and so on. The mentioned policies continue to be implemented in May, 2020: no lockdown was imposed to the population, the government continues asking population to stay home, and the police is monitoring agglomerations to avoid the rapid dissemination of the virus.",

In this case, we consider a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model. Based on the data collected from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health [23], one observed that the social distancing policies led about 7 days to effectively decrease the rate of growth of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro. In this case, we observe a sub-exponential growth of cases, and this nonexponential behavior is reproduced by our model. Finally, we used the model to discuss about the relaxation of such isolation policies, since this is in discussion by the Rio de Janeiro state government.",

For comparison, we also plot Eq. (8) (dashed line) together with data of the initial epidemic phase. As one can see, the behavior is not purely exponential, as was the case for the early growth of cases discussed in the previous subsection. This is consequence of the policies of social isolation implemented by the Rio de Janeiro state governement. Indeed, the number of confirmed cases is still growing, but this growth is slower than the initial exponencial behavior. We observed a linear behavior when we plot the data in the log-log scale, as observed in the data from several provinces of China [15] , as well for some other countries [26] .

Some local governments in Brazil are discussing about the relaxation of isolation of people including the Rio de Janeiro state government. A question of practical interest arises: when is it really safe to relax the isolation policies? To address this issue, we considered the following slight modification of the model presented in this section. In this case, the dynamics is implemented normally considering Eqs. (1) -(4) from the initial time t = 0 until a given time step t \u2032 . After t \u2032 , we take k 0 = 0 in order to simulate the relaxation of isolation policies, and the model is reduced to the SIQR model presented in section II.A. The equations are integrated numerically, and the results for distinct times t \u2032 are exhibited in Fig. 5 . One can see that if the relaxation of isolation policies is started at t \u2032 = 61 (May 4, 2020), the result is disastrous: the peak of Quarantined individuals increases fast. However, one can also see in Fig. 5 that after June 1, 2020, there is no considerably change in the peak, suggesting a security date to relax the isolation policies. Even after May 20 the peak does not increase considerably, which lead us to conclude that if the end of isolation procedures occurs about June 1 the damage will not be considerable.",

After the initial exponential growth of cases (from March 5 to March 24), the cases continue to growth, but it exhibits a distinct, subexponential behavior. The SIQR model with containment is capable of reproduce the mentioned sub-exponential behavior. Considering the data, we have observed that the initial exponential behavior changed to the sub-exponential one about 7 days after the implementation of social distancing policies.",

For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined individuals grows, stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number of such isolated individuals grows until Day 99 from the beginning (March 5, 2020) of the disesase spreading. Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number of quarantined individuals will occur about June 11, 2020. This is in line with a recent estimate [9] . That peak is associated with the quarantine of about 0.041% of the Rio de Janeiro state population (about 6, 700 individuals). This number is about 600 times lower than the one predicted by the SIQR model without isolation policies (taking k 0 = 0), suggesting the effectiveness of the social isolation. In fact, combining quarantine of individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) with social distance, i.e., multiple interventions, appears to be effective to contain the rapid evolution of confirmed cases seen in the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state. This is in line with a recent work [9] , where the authors analyzed the potential role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA. They conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.",

It can be interesting to split the population in two groups: one related to the informal economy, and another group that has the option of self-isolation. This analysis will enrich the model, and it can help the polciy makers to improve both the social isolation policies and the support to the fraction of the population that cannot afford for the self-isolation. The explicity analysis of deaths also need to be studied. Those proposals certainly will be considerd in future works.",
