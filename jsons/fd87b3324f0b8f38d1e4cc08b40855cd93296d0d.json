The MPS-selected Landrace line showed significantly lower degrees of pulmonary MPS lesions compared with the non-selected Landrace line. When changes in immunity before and after vaccination were compared, the percentage of B cells in the peripheral blood of the MPS-selected Landrace line was significantly lower than that of the non-selected line. Furthermore, the concentration of growth hormone and the mitogen activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the MPS-selected Landrace line showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower increases after vaccination than the non-selected line. Conversely, the concentration of peripheral blood interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) after Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccination was significantly higher in the MPS-selected Landrace line than in the non-selected line. Gene expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 was significantly higher in the MPS-selected Landrace line in immune tissues, with the exception of the hilar lymph nodes. The present results suggest that peripheral blood IFN-\u03b3, salivary IgA TLR2, and TLR4 are important immunological factors influencing the development of MPS lesions.",

This disease, which is induced mainly by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection, causes sizeable economic losses due to increased veterinary costs and product loss (Thacker et al. 1999; Maes et al. 2008) . M. hyopneumoniae is located in the lumina of the respiratory tract, as well as the mucosal surface of the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles (Blanchard et al. 1992) ; it can propagate on tracheal and bronchial surfaces after infection. In MPS, the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia show a loss of cilia from the epithelial cells and sloughing of epithelial cells into the airway lumina (Redondo et al. 2009 ). The primary clinical sign is a sporadic, dry, nonproductive cough (Thacker et al. 1999) . Destruction of the cilia by M. hyopneumoniae increases the morbidity to other pathogens such as Pasteurella multocida, porcine respiratory virus, reproductive syndrome virus, porcine circovirus type 2, and porcine respiratory coronavirus (Ciprian et al. 1988; Thacker et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2003; Maes et al. 2008) .",

Pigs were raised in a crude, vinyl-roofed, open-air barn with a bedding of rice husks. The bedding was neither changed or cleaned, nor was the excrement removed during the experiment, in order to provide stressful conditions with a bad environment. During the experimental period, M. hypneumoniae vaccine (HYORESP \u00ae ; Merial Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which consisted of an inactivated, adjuvant whole-cell preparation, was injected intramuscularly twice, once on day \u00c07 and again, on day 0, after blood collection. Thus, day 0 was defined as the day when the second dose of vaccine was administered. Immune functional analyses of the samples were conducted on days \u00c07, 0, 2, 7 and 14. Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture into vacuum tubes containing heparin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA: Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). At each sampling time, salivary samples were collected from the oral cavity with a cotton swab. In order to confirm the presence of pathogenic M. hyopneumoniae, we sampled the nasal mucus of each animal at each blood sampling time. On day 14, all pigs were killed by stunning at the anatomy facilities of Tohoku University, and immune tissues were collected. At this time, pulmonary MPS lesions were confirmed and measured by the veterinarian. In experiment 1, half of the pigs (six MPSselected and six non-selected) were killed on day 14, and the remaining pigs remained until they reached a body weight of approximately 110 kg (average age, 23 weeks), when they were transported to the slaughterhouse (day 30 in this experimental period) to be slaughtered at the Miyagi Prefecture meat market center. After slaughter, pulmonary MPS lesions were examined. Blood samples were not collected from these animals on day 14.",

These non-selected Landrace lines used in two experiments were genetically different lines. First, we observed a significant difference in MPS lung lesion scores between the MPS-selected Landrace line and two non-selected Landrace lines. As expected, lung lesion scores were significantly lower in the MPS- selected Landrace line than in the two non-selected Landrace lines. This result confirms the resistance to MPS of this selected line. In experiments 1 and 2, various immune traits were measured. Therefore, we calculated the correlations between the MPS lung lesion and the each immune trait to clarify which immune traits were related to the MPS lung lesion. However, we could not get any significant correlations. Nevertheless, many significant differences in immune traits between the MPS-selected line and non-selected line were observed in both experiments.",

Compared with the non-selected Landrace line, the percentage of B cells in peripheral blood (experiments 1 and 2) and their IgG secretions (experiment 2) and the proliferative abilities of PBMCs (experiment 1) were significantly decreased in the MPSselected Landrace line. Furthermore, the same result was confirmed in our previous study that the SRBCspecific IgG production was decreased in the MPSselected line (Katayama et al. 2011 ). In addition, previous studies have indicated that increased IgG production in serum is not directly involved in the clinical resistance to mycoplasma pneumonia (Thacker et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2006) . These results also indicate that increased antibody-specific IgG production most likely contributes to MPS lung lesion severity during natural infection.",

GH promotes lymphocyte survival and proliferation (Jeay et al. 2002; Borghetti et al. 2006) . Therefore, the decrease in B cell percentage, GH secretion and proliferative ability of PBMCs in the MPS-selected line suggests that these traits correlate with each other. Donahue et al. (2006) had reported that the secretion of GH was increased in male rats and female rats during diestrus exposed to a stressor. From this, the MPS-selected Landrace line may be less susceptible to stress than the non-selected Landrace line.

Peripheral blood IgG and saliva IgA are produced by different tissues or organs. The IgG and monomeric type of IgA are known to be produced in lymph node, spleen and bone marrow, and then secreted in blood. The dimeric type of IgA secreted in saliva is mainly produced in submucouslymph tissues, and then secreted in tears, saliva, sweat, colostrum (Parham 2009 ). The mucosal immune system is a first defense line of inner body surfaces and IgA is essential in this surface defense system. Secretion of IgA is critical for protection against infectious pathogens (Phalipon et al. 2002; Brandtzaeg 2003; Tlaskalov\u00e1-Hogenov\u00e1 et al. 2004 ). Increased IgA secretion may also play a protective role against M. hyopneumoniae infections in the upper respiratory tract (Woolard et al. 2004) . The activation of IgA-dependent mucosal immunity may be one of the reasons the lung lesions were reduced in the MPS-selected line.",

These differences in immune response suggest a genetically correlated response according to MPS selection. By recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns, the TLR family plays a critical role in host defense and in the development of inflammation. TLR2 recognizes ligands from Gram-positive bacteria, whereas TLR4 responds to endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria. TLRs are also involved in the responses to lung injury (Jiang et al. 2005) and to M. hyopneumoniae infection (Chu et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2008; Love et al. 2010) . IL-6 is a primary cytokine responsible for acute inflammation (Thacker 2006) and M. hyopneumoniae clearance in lungs (Pietsch et al. 1994; Wu et al. 2008) . IL-10 is an endogenous regulator that is critical for chemokine expression in acute lung inflammation (Shanley et al. 2000) . These results indicate that interactions between these cytokines and TLRs may contribute to the balance of the inflammatory and immune responses in the lungs of the MPS-selected line.",

Furthermore, our research indicates that immune system components such as IFN-\u03b3, TLR2, TLR4 and salivary IgA may be working synergistically against MPS. In present studies, cytokine and TLR levels in mucosal tissues, PAMs and salivary IgA were measured only in experiment 2. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the repeatability of these results. In addition, although the MPS-selected Landrace line showed a strong resistance against MPS, further studies to confirm whether this MPS-selected line has resistance to other respiratory chronic diseases are warranted.",
