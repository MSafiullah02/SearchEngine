Both forms of violence have used disruption or poisoning of water supplies as a weapon, and both may cause collateral damage to water supplies. The distinction between war and terrorism can be arguable. Special Operations forces may use some tactics similar to terrorists, with similar repercussions for water systems, but the main practical distinction is between formal military actions and more informal, smaller scale guerrilla-style activities that may be directed more at civilian personnel and designed to engender fear and panic as much as specific damage.",

Examples might be depleted uranium from shells or PCBs from electricity stations, e.g. in Bosnia. Mining or bombing of dams, distribution pipelines and treatment plants, the disablement of management systems, whether human organisational or computer control systems, and general environmental pollution are the main risks.",

Provision of any water is the first priority -quantity is more important than quality especially for use in sanitation rather than for drinking, as the most immediate danger is from disease caused by inadequate sanitation facilities. 2. Continuity of supplies of both water and power is the second most essential element. Restoring and securing electricity supplies is essential for pumps and control systems. 3. Provisions should be extended to the whole of the population that has been affected, whether by restoring public water supply networks or by mobile supplies. 4. Attend to water quality if the emergency supply was unsafe. This may involve importing freshwater in bottles or containers and provision of portable water treatment systems. But part of the community plan should be: (a) Education of the people in what to do in an emergency. Advise should be provided prior to or as early as possible in a conflict. This should comprise advise on (i) storage of water, including refrigeration where possible, (ii) purifying and disinfecting their own water by boiling (10 min at 100 o C kills most biological vectors; pasteurisation at 60 o C for 10 min removes living bacteria but not spores), other measures like exposure to ultraviolet light in sunlight or use of chlorine or dilute bleach to kill pathogens, filtering for helminths and other parasites, and also for sediments as bacteria and viruses tend to adhere to surfaces in multiple layers that make some inaccessible to UV irradiation, and (iii) the dangers of specific diseases. The EU standard for safe water is 100 bacteria/ml, but safe levels for viruses vary: one virus may be enough if it spreads or invades bacteria which then spread their transformed cells. Water temperatures of 10-30 o C are typical optimum temperatures for proliferation. The worst sources for emergency water supplies, especially in warm climates, are surface and shallow groundwater because of the danger of faecal pollution. Typical shallow groundwater in Africa, from a metre or two in depth is likely to be warm enough for bacterial proliferation, whereas in central Europe it is likely to be cooler than 10 o C, especially in winter, so that E. coli (a good indicator species) cannot multiply. Somewhat deeper groundwater will be cooler and will have been filtered more effectively during a longer period of percolation. (b) The availability of cheap, basic equipment with which to do this.",
