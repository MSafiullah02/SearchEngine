Further, human studies provided evidence pointing to the increased development of emotional problems and EDR-related disorders in patients with various types of AIDs, such as SLE and multiple sclerosis (MS), in a disease state/severity-dependent manner [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . For example, among patients with childhood-onset SLE, 95% manifest neuropsychiatric SLE (NSLE). Mood and anxiety disorders were the most common psychiatric conditions with the prevalence rate of 60% and 20% [13] . Even about 40% of patients with SLE without CNS manifestations suffer from psychological distress compared with 6% in controls. It is, thus, not surprising that both emotional coping and depressive symptoms were correlated with non-NSLE [14, 15] . Interestingly, there was an increased activation of the brain regions related to emotion regulation/processing (e.g., the amygdala and superior temporal) in SLE patients. However further analyses led to identifying this increased activity of emotional circuit as a consequence of CNS involvement by SLE [18] . Among patients with MS, emotional troubles were more than twofold more likely to occur in patients who had an exacerbation or progressive nonremitting MS compared to stable patients. This was reflected by an increased rate of using emotion-focused coping styles in patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) compared to stable patients [16, 17] . Mood disturbance was correlated negatively with sIL-2r levels and positively with joint pain in patients with RA [19] . Consistent with data from human studies, animal experiments have also supported the link between emotionality-related behaviors and AIDs. Clearly, AIDs result from IMMDR. Interestingly, the AIDs-related IMMDR has been observed in the specific brain regions associated with emotional behaviors, particularly anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors [20] . In this manner, the link between AIDs and IMMERS is strengthened.",

Studies emphasize the pivotal role of cytokines and neuroendocrine factors in the pathogenesis of AABS [21] . B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) transgenic mice model, which is used as an experimental model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, exhibited an anxious phenotype along with the following changes in immune brain signaling, such as increased IgG titers in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex and increased CD68 (as a maker of activated microglia/macrophages) and GFAP (as a maker of activated astrocytes) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus in mice at 4.5-5 months of age, but not in young (2 months of age) mice [22] . EAE models of MS showed an increase in levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the hypothalamus. This indicates an inflammatory central basis behind anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors [20] . These emotional deficits were shown to display before the onset of MS [20, 23] . Consistently, behavioral problems usually manifest before symptoms of impaired cognitive and motor performance in dementia. Moreover, this model showed an early (at day 4) and a meaningful increase in circulating cytokine levels and CD3 + T cell counts. Of note, these inflammatory markers began to decrease in the periphery (at day 8) almost when their infiltration in the CNS (at day 10) started [23] . In the MRL-lpr model of AID, which is a well-documented model of emotional deficits [24, 25] , a reduced preference to glucose, and as an index of emotionality, was detected in 5-to 6-week-old mice [26] . This deficit could be diminished by immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide and was pronounced by means of chronic administration of IL-6 [26] .",

For example, emotional stress is ranked as the second most common neuropsychological cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) owing to its record in approximately 40-50% of these patients [30, 31] . At the molecular levels, these patients have shown increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-18) and decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10). Thus, it is not surprising that the inflammatory response and respective cytokines are supposed as one of the possible mechanisms linking the experience of negative emotions or ER-related disorders and the progression of cardiovascular diseases, of course along with the neuroendocrine system and apoptosis signaling pathways [27, 30, [32] [33] [34] [35] . It is to be noted that when patients with cardiovascular diseases are stratified according to their emotional background, some cytokines are more highlighted than others, for example, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10, but not IL-6, considering depressive symptoms in CHF patients [35] . Cognitive reappraisal is found to correlate positively with the engagement of the lateral and prefrontal regions and inversely with the engagement of the amygdala and medial orbitofrontal cortex [36] . The role of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the progression of cardiovascular diseases is widely appreciated [37] . Studies show that IL-6 is significantly involved in efforts to arbitrate between the sides of the relationship between the reappraisal-related activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and preclinical atherosclerosis (evaluated by carotid artery intima-media thickness and inter-adventitial diameter) in healthy individuals [38] . The Normative Aging Study carried out a 3-year follow-up study in older men (mean 60.3 \u00b1 7.9 years). There was a dose-response relationship between negative emotions, evaluated by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) within the duration of the study (p = 0.005) [39] . Meanwhile, the circulating levels of IL-6 were positively associated with the reappraisal-related activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in healthy subjects [38] . However, higher reappraisals and suppressions were positively and inversely associated with the serum levels of CRP, respectively [40] . On the other hand, the reflection of watching the ice hockey match, as a real-life emotional excitement, on serum levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and IL-6 was more pronounced in spectators with coronary artery disease compared with healthy spectators [41] .",

Also, individual studies, either cross-sectional or follow-up, have providence evidence of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and its receptors, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 [45] [46] [47] [48] , an enhanced IL-6/IL-10 ratio, and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in CHF patients with type D personality compared to those without type D personality [45] . Interestingly, in CHF patients, the inflammatory effect of type D personality appears to resemble closely the effect of aging. There was a similar increased pattern of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in younger CHF patients with type D personality and older patients without this personality trait [46] .",

In parallel with this emotional stress, the immune system prepares itself before the procedure and seeks for ways to prolong this preparation even 4 months after the procedure. This is a reflection of the joint regulation of our body by both the immune system and the emotional brain [51] . The immune system responds to this challenge by decreasing NK cell activity, decreasing production of IFN-\u03b3, and increasing production of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 [51] . Further, there was a significantly positive relationship between mothers with breast cancer and their adult daughters on distress levels. This persuaded scientists to investigate the immune profile and its association with distress in daughters' group. Daughters' distress levels were inversely associated with IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3 production and also with IL-2-induced natural cytotoxic activity (NCA) [52, 53] . Further, NCA activity and the production of Th1 cytokines were both negatively related to the emotional distress degree [53] . Antoni and his colleagues accomplished a genome-wide transcriptional analysis on leukocyte samples taken from women subject to the treatment of stage 0-III breast cancer and demonstrated that the negative affect, evaluated by the affects balance scale (ABS), was significantly associated with greater than 50% increased expression of leukocyte transcripts such as proinflammatory marker-related genes [54] . Another multiplex analysis on circulating concentration of 27 cytokines identified the IL-6 profile as the predictor of physical and cognitive functioning and also the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) profile as the predictor of emotional functioning [55] . Further, the experience of childhood emotional neglect/abuse was associated with lower levels of NCA at the first evaluation after breast cancer surgery [56] .",

Patients with IBD confront various ER-related problems in their social life in a disease severity-dependent manner, such as higher sensitivity to negative emotions, fewer dropping into bar/disco and delayed falling in love, and experiencing more depressive and anxious symptoms, not only compared to controls, but also compared to patients with other chronic conditions [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . Neuroimaging studies have indicated a reduction in both the volume and the activation of brain regions related to emotional processing [71, 72] . The gray matter (GM) volume of both the frontal cortex and the anterior midcingulate cortex was reduced in patients with Crohn's disease (a type of IBD) compared to controls. More interestingly, disease duration was found to correlate with the GM volumes of some brain regions, importantly, limbic areas [71] . Also, patients with ulcerative colitis (another type of IBD) showed reduced activity, evaluated by BOLD signal, within the amygdala, thalamic regions, and cerebellar areas during the emotional visual task, compared to the control group [72] .",

Various regression analyses showed that this correlation is independent of prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, education, race, body mass, season, and NES, optimism, extraversion, mastery, self-esteem, purpose, and selfreported health [74, 75] . By contrast, childhood socioeconomic status, as assessed by \"the number of childhood years during which their parents owned their home,\" was found to correspond negatively with both the risk of illness and infection and, in a word, with vulnerability to common colds [76] . This finding along with approximately the similar increased risk of common colds in \"those whose parents did not own their home during their early life but did during adolescence\" in \"those whose parents never owned their home\" [76] indicate that (a) the childhood period takes more impression of socioeconomic status of their family than other lifetime periods (e.g., adolescence) such that (b) it would influence the mind-body background of future life. Meanwhile, PES and NES were negatively and positively related to the subjective report of unfounded symptoms of common cold, respectively [74, 75] .",

For example, patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represent a poor recognition of several basic emotions, e.g., anger, sadness, disgust, fear, and contempt. Also, patients with the probable AD are more likely to fail to recognize fear and contempt compared with controls [79] . In patients with mild AD, the recognition of more basic emotions are missed, and they are less able to differentiate between some emotions, e.g., happiness and sadness [80] . Apathy in patients with AD was found to correlate positively with dysfunction in the prefrontal and anterior temporal regions [81] . Regarding memory recall, individuals with AD presented no preference to recall better emotional memories other than nonemotional ones, standing in stark contrast to healthy subjects, either young or older [82] . Experimental models provided evidence that there are deficits in the emotional memory performance in AD, which can be diminished by treatment with cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) [83] . This pleasant effect of CNF1 was accompanied by a reduced IL-1\u03b2 expression in the hippocampus, along with other encouraging events, especially enhancing the energy amount evaluated by the ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) levels [83] . There is a spectrum of behavioral problems in patients with AD [84] . Agitation is the second most common behavior in AD, after apathy. It has been associated with cognitive impairment [84] . Inflammatory changes appear to pave the way for agitation. There were higher IL-1\u03b2 levels and decreased NK cell activity in both the morning and evening periods corresponding with preagitation and agitation phases of AD [85] .",

In addition, the steps toward normalizing the stress-induced CORT levels were made with the lower speed in long-term HFD-exposed offspring than standard chow diet (SD)-exposed offspring at the end of stress challenge [88] . Regarding inflammation-related markers, the increased expression of IL-6 and IL-1Ra in long-term HFD-exposed offspring than chow-exposed ones in the amygdala was found in both females and males [88] , while changes in the expression of NF-kB and I-kappa-B-alpha (IkBa) were observed only in female, but not in male, offspring [88] . Mice subjected to short-term (1-3 weeks) HFD also exhibited anxiety-like behaviors in addition to learning and memory impairments and had significantly higher levels of homovanillic acid-a metabolite of dopamine-in their hippocampus and cortex but without any alteration in the gene expression of inflammatory markers [89] . Further, chronic western diet (WD) intake led to the increased responsiveness to LPS, which was represented in higher and more prolonged protein/mRNA measures of IL-6 in both plasma and hypothalamus, while there was no significant difference in the plasma levels of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 between WD and SD groups [90] . In parallel with the increased expression of IL-6, there was significantly increased mRNA expression of SOCS-3, which belonged to the suppressors-of-cytokinesignaling (SOCS) family of proteins, in the hypothalamus in WD than SD mice [90] . However, the LPS-induced mRNA expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in the hippocampus were significantly higher in WD than SD mice. Also, LPS augmented the levels of adipokines, e.g., CST, leptin, and resistin, more significantly in WD mice when compared with mice exposed to SD [90] . Altogether, both short-term and long-term obesity in either young adult or maternally can lead to display disturbed anxiety-like behaviors and impaired learning/memory, and brain inflammation might be one of the reasons behind these HFD-related events [88] [89] [90] [91] . Chronologically, at first, learning/memory and then anxiety-like behaviors are impaired, and disturbance in depressive-like behaviors is subject to exposure to an immune challenge, such as LPS [90] .",

This chapter provided evidence linking physiological states/physical diseases to the impairment of both the immune system and emotion regulation. Altogether, the immunoemotional regulatory system (IMMERS) covers both psychological states/psychiatric diseases and physiological states/physical diseases. Inevitably, such a system must comprise both the immune mediators and the neuroendocrine messengers, which will be discussed in the next chapter.",
