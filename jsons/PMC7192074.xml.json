This result suggests the ability to induce a rapid type I interferon response [7]. The production of type I IFNs (primarily alpha IFN [IFN-\u03b1] and IFN-\u03b2) plays a central role in the induction of antiviral responses. Type I IFNs influence protein synthesis, growth regulation, and apoptosis and enhance the maturation of DCs, the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, and the differentiation of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes [19]. However, innate immune hyperactivation could be involved in the dysregulation of a series of proinflammatory cytokines during viral infection [20].",

TLR7-specific agonists generally induce IFN-regulated cytokines, but TLR8-specific agonists lead primarily to the production of proinflammatory cytokines [23].
