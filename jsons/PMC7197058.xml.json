There is an urgent need for developing biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The combination of multiple cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers has emerged as an accurate diagnostic and prognostic model, while blood-based markers have also been explored [10, 22]. Recently, also gene expression and methylation signatures from blood samples have been examined for this purpose [30].",

We achieve this by constructing a filtered simplicial complex, a mathematical object consisting of vertices, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, and their higher dimensional analogues, called simplices, with information on when these are added to the complex. First we add a vertex for each point in the point cloud at time 0, then whenever two disks intersect, we add an edge. Every time three disks intersect, we add a triangle, and similarly we add higher dimensional simplices for higher order intersections. Therefore, we get a sequence of simplices. In this sequence, the topological persistence computation is a set of birth-death pairs of homology cycle classes that indicate when a class is born and when it dies. In the previous example, it indicates when the loops are formed and when they are filled up.
