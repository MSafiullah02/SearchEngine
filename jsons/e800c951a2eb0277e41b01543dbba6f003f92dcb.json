The humoral reaction containing cytokines and antibodies is expected to activate when the pathogens come back. Exploiting this nature of body protection, neutralizing antibodies have been investigated. Learning from past, in parallel to SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV who caused previous pandemics, are recalled in this review. We here propose insights of origin and characteristics and perspective for the future of antibodies development. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f In the progress of B-cell development, immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain gene recombination typically occurs before immunoglobulin light (IgL) chain gene recombination [4]. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) can inhibit the viral infection via following the viral replication cycle. Attachment is the first critical step blocked by Abs by interfering with the virion-receptor binding. Moreover, Abs may induce the aggregation of viral particles which cause a reduction of individual penetration. In post-attachment step, Abs on the virion possibly dampen virus endocytosis internalization leading to the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 lysosomal degradation. The Abs also block fusion of virion when they intercalate between viruses and cell membrane. The next stage of interference is to uncoat or appropriate intracellular localization of core or capsid. Lastly, Abs might bind virion surface then inhibit the metabolic events that blocks the replication of viruses even after internalization [3] [5] [6].",

            "text": "The approach to nAbs design relies on the identification of antigens ; in other words, the epitopes are the central of quests. However, the variable regions of the antigen induce the largest fraction of the antibodies whereas broadly nAbs represent only a minor proportion of the response. The major challenges related to both sides were previously described: viral antigen and the generation of antibodies to these sites. In the detail, the antigen concerns are (1) epitope masking or shielding by glycans or protein loops; (2) transient exposure during the entry process or via other mechanisms such as viral \"breathing;\" (3) the size of conserved epitopes is small resulting in the limitation of interaction, (4) epitopes are constrainedly accessible, (5) the mutability of epitopes. Regarding antibody production, (1) the need for extensive somatic mutations and focused evolution; (2) the use of specific germline allelic variants and HCDR3s of particular length and structure; and (3) the molecular mimicry of host molecules are mentioned [6]. Coronaviruses Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses in the family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae, order Nidovirales. In the subfamily Coronavirinae, coronaviruses include 4 genres: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus (Figure 1). Coronaviruses infect a wide variety of hosts including many species of birds, mammals and humans [7]. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses circulate among mammals, gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds and mammals. Within betacoronaviruses, there are 4 lineages: lineage A contains human coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43, lineage B to which SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) belongs, lineage C belongs to MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome) and the lineage D has the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 who are close to MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "S protein of SARS-CoV is composed of two functionally distinct subunits: the globular S1 subunit (~aa 12-680) allows receptor recognition, whereas the S2 subunit (~aa 681-1255) facilitates membrane fusion and anchors S into the viral membrane. S1 is organized in four distinct domains A-D. Domains S1A and S1B may be used as a receptor-binding domain (RBD, aa 318-510) containing the highly conserved receptor-binding motif (RBM, aa 424-494) [21]. Moreover, RBD contains 3 functional glycosylation sites located at amino acids 318, 330 and 357, which are necessary for S expression but do not affect ACE2 binding [22]. S1B forms an extended loop on Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 the viral membrane-distal side and is an hypervariable region [20]. S2 contains the fusion peptides (FP1 and FP2) [23], two heptad repeat regions (HR1, aa ~889-972 and HR2, aa ~1142-1193) and the well conserved transmembrane domain [24]. The mechanism of interactions with peptidases (aminopeptidase APN, ACE2, DPP4) as a cellular receptor for most coronaviruses is not known. Indeed, the binding of coronaviruses to their receptor is not enough and S protein on the surface of the virus must undergo proteolytic maturation. Coronaviruses do not use the catalytic activity of peptidases serving as receptors for this maturation but enter after the action of proteases located close to the receptors. The binding of SARS-CoV to its ACE2 receptor is followed by internalization and decrease in ACE2 enzyme activity on the cell surface, which may partly explain the severity of SARS-CoV infections [25]. Anti-S1 & RBD antibodies Neutralizing Abs can fight against viral infections by blocking binding to cellular receptors or by interfering with viral fusion. Besides, in the case of enveloped viruses, the Abs can recruit effector cells or the complement, thus allowing the destruction of the infected cells or the lysis of the viral particles [6]. The S1 domain contains most of the epitopes recognized by nAbs during infection. The RBD located in this S1 domain would be the most important target for nAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [26] [27] [28] [29]. More specifically, certain secondary structures such as extended loops seem to be particularly immunogenic. RBD of SARS-CoV is composed of 193 amino acids (N318-V510) within S protein. Five regions on the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (residues 274-306, 510-586, 587-628, 784-803 and 870-893), in which three first regions belong to S1 subunit in the CTD2 and CTD3 (C-terminal domain) and two later belong to HR1 domain of the S2 subunit, were predicted to be associated with a robust immune response to SARS-CoV [30]. Several specific-nAbs for SARS-CoV were discovered; unfortunately none of them are under clinical trial [31]. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 Figure 2. S protein of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 with its subdomains are the target of antibodies. The antibodies cited in this review have different origins or techniques, and some of them have specific targets such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) containing the receptor binding motif (RBM), the heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2). Some antibodies could bind SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.",

S protein has a long N-terminal domain, a short Cterminal domain and assembles into homotrimers on the surface of the viral particle [19] . S protein has a decisive role in cellular tropism and for pathogenicity [20] .",

The S2 protein is highly conserved. No mutation in HR1 was reported in an analysis of the amino acid sequences of the S protein from 94 SARS-CoV clinical isolates.

Some patients (5.7%) had neutralizing Abs titers under the detectable level (ID50: <40) [83] . The level of IgG antibodies was different between gender, age and clinical classification. The average IgG antibody level in female patients was higher than in male patients [84] . Patient over 40 years old developed higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific nAbs than the younger persons. Patients with a worse clinical classification had a higher antibody titer [83] . This remark is useful to select a research candidate and to save research time. The passive antibody therapy, such as plasma fusion containing polyclonal antibodies from COVID-19 neutralized patients has been tested. This method was tested as an option to treat other viruses such as influenza, Ebola or SARS-CoV [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] . The lack of human sera, and the possibility of contamination with other infectious agents limit this strategy. However, several groups have reported some positive results demonstrating the potential of this approach. After one dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640, the patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive revealed an improvement. Among ten patients, seven patients were virus-negative post transfusion [90] . Whereas in another study, among 5 patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a neutralization titer greater than 40, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion [91] . More studies might brighter this approach but evaluation in clinical trials are also still far from a bold conclusion.",

            "text": ": from 2012 to present MERS-CoV, a zoonotic virus, belonging to lineage C in the genre betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome, in 2012. As of August 11, 2016, the virus had infected 1,791 patients, with a mortality rate of 35.6% [53]. The natural reservoir of MERS-CoV is assumedly bats whereas intermediate host is possibly dromedary camels [54][55][56][57]. BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 bat viruses have been shown to be the closest phylogenetically even if these viruses are not direct ancestors[15]. The first transmission of a bat virus to camels for an adaptation before its emergence into human was suggested. nAbs anti-MERS-CoV could accordingly be found in camels. Moreover, the viruses circulating in dromedaries and in humans are very close suggesting that the dromedary is a reservoir of the virus [58][59]. The genomic structures of bat, human and camel MERS-CoVs are similar but their genomic sequences are different[16]. fragment containing residues 358-588 of S protein, the neutralization against MERS-CoV of induced Abs were observed[63]. Other studies, also approaching RBD, reported the generated Abs with the epitopes aa 377-662 or aa 377-588 of MERS-CoV RBD. The latter elicited the strongest effect which effectively neutralized MERS-CoV infection[64] [65]. The epitope aa 736-761 also induced nAbs[66].Using a novel panning strategy, seven anti-S1 scFvs Abs, named 1E9, 1F8, 3A1, 3B12, 3C12, 3B11, and M14D3, which bind one or several of these three different epitopes (aa 21-358, 349-751 and 349-590) were identified. They neutralized MERS-CoV infection at nanomolar of concentration[67].Other Abs, such as MERS-4 and its variant MERS-4V2, were intriguingly discovered to bind RBD and compete with DPP4 but from outside. MERS-4 Fab and MERS-4V2 scFv interact with \u03b25-\u03b26, \u03b26-\u03b27, and \u03b27-\u03b28 loops of RBD resulting in the inhibition of MERS-CoV infection[68] [69].Three human monoclonal Abs, m336, m337, and m338 bind RBD of MERS-CoV at extremely low concentration, 4.2, 9.3, and 15 nM, respectively. m336, that neutralized 50% of both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV at 0.005 and 0.07 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, suggested the prophylaxis and therapy of MERS-CoV infection[70].In another study, using MERS-RBD to immunize mice, two monoclonal nAbs 4C2 and 2E6 recognizing an epitope that partially overlaps the receptor-binding footprint in MERS-CoV RBD were identified . The 4C2 could further reduce the number of viral particles in MERS-CoV infected mice[71]. efforts of scientists to find anti-MERS-CoV antibodies, no vaccine has been found yet and the virus continues to circulate in human beings and other species.SARS-CoV-2: from 2019 to present The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, is creating a pandemic over the world with the number of confirmed cases reached 3 529 408, of which 248 025 were dead up to the 4th May, 2020 [1].Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated similarity with SARS-CoV and bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) with 79.6% and 88% sequence identity, respectively. They belong to lineage B of the beta coronavirus genus[73]",

Some coronaviruses can infect birds, bats and other species, some are phylogenetically similar to known pathogenic human coronaviruses. The search for the reservoir has resulted in the vast expansion of the library of known coronaviruses which suggests that additional emergence events are possible.Pandemics will create the urgent need for vaccines around the world simultaneously.But it is not because of this urgency that we can license a vaccine when its benefitsand side effects are not clear. Researching a vaccine for influenza viruses, HIV or SARS-CoV-2 is always challenging. Firstly, although the immunogen for protection of a virus, glycoproteins gp120 or gp41 of HIV or S protein of SARS-CoV-2 for example, can be quickly detected, but the immune response needs to be optimized with a good antigen design. Secondly, any drug has side effects immediately or in long-term, directly by the composition of the medication or indirectly by the response of the body to the medication. Pre-clinical experiences with vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are typical examples in aggravating lung disease, either directly or by antibody-dependent enhancement [116] [117] [118]. Thirdly, in natural acquired infection, the time point of the detection of nAbs can be easily observed, from 10-14days post-infection in SARS-CoV-2 case for example[119]",

One of these two viral isolates in this study, WIV1, was able to recognize the human ACE2 receptor and to replicate in certain human cell lines, suggesting that this virus can directly infect humans without adaptation[13].",
