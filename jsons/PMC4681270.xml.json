From past experience working in hospital settings, the team knew that the frequency and nature of caregiving performed varied by time of day. Therefore, observation hours were split between daytime hours (9:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.), when there was more activity; evening hours (3:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.), when there was reduced activity; and at night (10:00 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.), when there was even less activity. There was a median of 30.5 beds (interquartile range, 30-33) in the patient ward, but each observer was responsible for observing a maximum of 10 patients and their respective caregivers. The observers sat either on a stool or on an empty patient bed and recorded interactions between family caregivers and patients and caregivers' behavior and practices as detailed handwritten notes.",

Three respondents reported that they did not have knowledge about contagious diseases prior to this hospital visit, and they heard about them from the nurses and doctors during their stay in the hospital wards. However, family caregivers did not fully understand the biomedical explanation of contagion. They provided multiple examples of transmission of infectious diseases in hospital settings that were related to touching surfaces and objects contaminated with patients' secretions and excretions (Table 3\n). For example, many family caregivers knew that diarrhea could be a water-borne disease, but examples they gave suggested that many did not fully understand the oral-fecal route of diarrheal infection. One respondent described that, when the bathroom floor is dirty, the tap water in the bathroom is more likely to be unsafe to drink: \u201cDiarrhea spreads from lack of cleanliness\u2026 in this ward; the caregivers often clean the diarrhea patients' feces in the bathroom and sometimes the feces sticks on the floor. The family members of other patients collect water from the bathroom and wash their utensils. The patients also use the tap water from the bathroom.

The day-to-day exposure to a crowded ward containing patients with infectious diseases is highly conducive to transmission of diseases to a large number of family caregivers.15\n",

For example, they perceived that washing hands with soap could reduce disease transmission; however, we rarely observed caregivers washing their hands with soap after cleaning patients' anuses, vomit, or mucus. Family caregivers' lack of handwashing with soap after cleaning patients' excretions and secretions increased the possibilities of transferring viruses and bacteria to other objects and surfaces that may have the potential to infect themselves or nearby patients and attendants.16 The traditional practice of rinsing fingers with just a little water on a dinner plate before putting food on it was unlikely to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. Indeed, through this practice, both the plate and the food might be contaminated by the viruses and bacteria on the caregivers' hands.2, 3\n",

Public tertiary care hospitals play a crucial role in the health care of lower income groups in Bangladesh and are consistently overcrowded; on average, 11 patients are hospitalized for every 10 beds.11 Because the study sites were large government tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh, we would expect similar conditions in other public tertiary care hospitals, although not necessarily in private and specialized health facilities. Another limitation is that, because each researcher was responsible for observing multiple patients and caregivers, he/she might have missed activities that occurred simultaneously. Therefore, the observational methods used in this study may underestimate the actual frequency of caregiving activities performed by family caregivers.",

Immediate strategies are needed to reduce family caregivers' exposures to infectious agents. One strategy would be to simply restrict family members' access to the wards. However, this would be difficult because of health care workers' unwillingness or inability to provide patient care and because of the psychologic support needed and expected by patients from family caregivers.8, 9 A possible short-term strategy would be to engage family caregivers in interventions to prevent hospital-acquired infections.17 In a community-based intervention in Bangladesh, improved understanding of germ theory contributed to high acceptability of hygiene practices including hand hygiene.18 Considering family caregivers' perspectives on contagious disease transmission and prevention, a health education intervention that uses culturally appropriate messages based on awareness of infections and the importance of hand hygiene could be developed. Such interventions would need to be simple enough for health care workers to implement them daily in the setting of high turnover rates of patients and family caregivers. Pilot interventions in some public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh could explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of such an approach. However, even when family caregivers are highly motivated, poor hospital infrastructure, including lack of water and handwashing stations, may be barriers to handwashing practices. In settings where handwashing stations with running water and soap are unavailable, use of hand sanitizer could be one alternative for cleaning hands. Hand sanitizer has been found to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria and has the added advantage that it does not require water.19 However, family caregivers in Bangladesh may be unfamiliar with this cleansing agent and would require training on its use. In a low-income country like Bangladesh where the annual total per capita spending on health is $12 per person per year,20 an additional training expense and cost of the hand sanitizer (US $2.5 per 200 mL; Square Toiletries Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh) could be cost prohibitive. Research to explore strategies to improve family caregivers' hand hygiene could reduce their exposure to infectious agents.",
