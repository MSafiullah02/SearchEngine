            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) is a causative agent of severe and atypical pneumonia 1, 2 that caused a global outbreak in 2003, resulting in over 8000 probable cases with a mortality of some 10%. Clinical pathology indicates bronchial epithelial denudation, multinucleated syncytial cells, loss of cilia, squamous metaplasia, inflammation infiltration of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils into lung tissue 2, 3. Clinical laboratory examination reveals SARS\u2010CoV triggering lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia 4, 5 while rapidly elevating serum of inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201018, TGF\u2010\u03b21, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, MIG, and IL\u20108 6, 7. SARS\u2010CoV\u2010induced proinflammatory cytokine storms are linked with recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and immune responder cells such as natural killer, T, and B cells into the lungs, resulting in acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, even lung fibrosis in the late phase 7.",

            "text": "SARS\u2010CoV genome is an approximately 30 kbp positive\u2010stranded RNA with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly(A) tract, containing 14 ORFs 8, 9. Polyprotein replicases 1a and 1ab (\u223c450 and \u223c750 kDa, respectively) encoded by 5\u2032 proximal, producing nonstructural (NS) proteins primarily involved in RNA replication. Specifically, papain\u2010like protease (PLpro) and 3C\u2010like protease, two embedded proteases, mediate the processing of 1a and 1ab precursors into 16 NS proteins (termed NS 1 through NS16). PLpro recognizes a consensus motif LXGG as consensus cleavage sequence of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes, and cleaves polyprotein replicase 1a at NS1/2, NS2/3, and NS3/4 boundaries 10, 11. Modeling with crystal structures of herpes virus associated ubiquitin\u2010specific protease and in vitro cleavage assays reveal SARS\u2010CoV PLpro as a deubiquitinating enzyme 12, 13. These in vitro de\u2010ubiquination assays illustrate cleavage of interferon (IFN)\u2010induced 15\u2010kDa protein (ISG15)\u2010conjugated proteins by PLpro 12, 13. Deubiquitinating/de\u2010ISGylating activity of PLpro is believed to link with a mechanism that SARS\u2010CoV infection induces on type I IFNs in cell culture 14. PLpro is further identified by blocking type I IFN synthesis through inhibiting phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 15. PLpro antagonizes type I IFN signaling pathway by polyubiquitination and degradation of extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), resulting in the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and decrease of IFN\u2010stimulated gene expression such as PKR, 2\u2032\u20105\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), IL\u20106, and IL\u20108 16. A deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis that inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB signaling via deubiquitination and inactivation of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)\u2010associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6 17 has been reported to promote inflammatory responses via mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK)\u2010mediated but NF\u2010\u03baB independent pathways 18. Deubiquitinating protease A20 inhibits TLR4\u2010mediated NF\u2010\u03baB activation, directly removing K63\u2010linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF6 while reducing production of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines by inactivation of RIG\u2010I dependent antiviral signaling 19. Yet the role of deubiquitinating enzyme PLpro in anti\u2010inflammation and proinflammatory response remains unclear. This study assesses possible effect of SARS\u2010CoV PLpro on cytokine induction: TGF\u2010\u03b21, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IL\u20101\u03b1, regulated and normal T cell expressed and secreted protein (RANTES). Comparative proteomic analysis of PLpro expressing versus vector control cells yielded data on the relation between TGF\u2010\u03b21 production and protein expression change induced by PLpro, affording insights into molecular mechanism(s) of SARS pathogenesis.",

Identified proteins matched with Mascot score above 75; MW and pI of indicated proteins in 2DE gel (Fig. 4, Tables 1, 2). Amino acid sequence coverage of identified proteins varied (4\u201371%). MS analysis of HSP27 (Spot ID 1) showed a Mascot score of 161, five matched peptides, and sequence coverage of 37%; vimentin (Spot ID 7) showed a Mascot score of 1420, sequence coverage of 71%, and 14 matched peptides. Peptide peaks from Q\u2010TOF MS analysis from three representative spots of interest, vimentin (Spot ID 7), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Spot ID 17), and HSP27 (Spot ID 1) appear in Supporting Information Fig. S1A\u2013C. Analyzing cell lysates by Western blot confirms protein profiling induced by PLpro (Fig. 5), i.e. significant rise of vimentin and HSP27 coupled with substantial decline of ERK1 in PLpro\u2010expressing cells compared to vector controls, consistent with 2DE/Q\u2010TOF MS/MS analysis in Fig. 4, Tables 1, 2. Moreover, quantitative real\u2010time PCR indicated mRNA expression of ubiquitin\u2010conjugating enzyme E2\u201325 kDa (Spot ID 3) and protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (Spot ID 11) upregulated twofold in PLpro\u2010expressing cells, but no change in controls (Supporting Information Fig. S2), supporting 2D/MS data (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Thus, 21 up\u2010 and 13 downregulated proteins were identified in PLpro\u2010expressing cells.",

Proteomic analysis indicated PLpro upregulating expression of many TGF\u2010\u03b21\u2010associated genes, e.g. HSP27 (Spot ID 1), vimentin (Spot ID 7), protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (Spot ID 11), retinal dehydrogenase 2 (Spot ID 13), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Spot ID 17), glutathione transferase omega\u20101 (Spot ID 21) (Fig. 8, Table 1). Functional analysis using PANTHER classification system demonstrated PLpro upregulating cytoskeleton proteins such as vimentin (Spot ID 7), T\u2010complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (Spot ID 9), desmoplakin (Spot ID 12), junction plakoglobin (Spot ID 16), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Spot ID 17), and tropomyosin alpha\u20103 chain (TPM3, Spot ID 18).
