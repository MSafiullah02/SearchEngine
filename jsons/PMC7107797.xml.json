            "text": "A major goal of genetics today is the characterization of genetic diversity in a population. In microbes, such diversity is generated in particular by high mutation rates, which may generate both nucleotide substitutions as well as point insertions or deletions (indels) (1). Longer indels may also occur (2), as may events of genetic recombination. Disease pathogenesis, progression, management and epidemiology are all affected by the genetic diversity created in microbial populations (3\u20139). Thus, characterizing this diversity is of utmost importance in clinical as well as research settings, which makes the development and improvement of suitable sequencing technologies crucial (10\u201312). The availability of second-generation DNA sequencing technologies (13), with the Illumina platform currently at the forefront, has made the sequencing of genomes conventional. In particular, this technology has dramatically furthered the study of viruses, whose relatively small genomes allow in depth characterization of a population of viruses (14,15).",

            "text": "Illumina-based sequencing allows the detection of minor variants that the standard Sanger-based method often missed. However, Illumina short-read sequencing technologies all share one major limitation, the short length of each read, which typically ranges between 75 and 600 bp (for a paired end read). This means that a complete viral genome sequence cannot be obtained in a single read, impairing the ability to link distant mutations in an individual viral genome. Another Illumina limitation is that RNA cannot be sequenced directly. During library preparation, RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA and amplified by PCR. This creates multiple problems that have been extensively discussed but not resolved (10): first, reverse transcription and PCR may introduce errors during early stages of amplification that will be carried on to later stages (16\u201318). Second, some molecules may be preferentially amplified over others, a term known as PCR bias. Third, PCR and reverse transcription reactions can often result in chimeric DNA sequences that originate from different molecules (19\u201321). Together, these problems make the inference of haplotypes from PCR-based libraries that are sequenced with Illumina extremely limited.",

The long reads provided by these methods have the potential to allow for the inference of up to an entire genome of a typical RNA virus, whose genome is generally shorter than 10,000 bp (23\u201327). However, one of the major shortcomings of the third generation technologies are their relatively high error rates, with the proportion of errors on a read often exceeding 10% (28,29). This high error rate makes the detection of true single-nucleotide variants very difficult (7,30,31).",

We focused our analysis on the MS2 bacteriophage, an extremely small (3569 bases) and fast evolving +ssRNA virus (32,33) that is highly amenable to direct sequencing with Oxford Nanopore MinION. We sequenced virus populations in parallel using both MinION and Illumina, allowing us to corroborate the inferences of AssociVar. This then allowed us to directly infer relationships between mutations and to deduce the entire genome sequences of viral strains in the population. We were also able to use AssociVar to analyze a yeast mRNA sample and data of mixed strains of Zika Virus.

The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65\u00b0C followed by incubation on ice for 7 min. After brief centrifugation, 4 \u03bcl of 5X First-Strand Buffer were added along with 1 \u03bcl DTT (0.1 M), 1 \u03bcl of RNase OUT (Thermo Scientific) and 1 \u03bcl of SuperScript\u2122 III RT (200 units/\u03bcl). The mixture was incubated for 60 mins at 55\u00b0C followed by inactivation for 15 mins at 70\u00b0C. The last step was adding 1 \u03bcl of RNase H to the reaction according to manufacturer instructions. cDNA from the reverse transcription reaction was directly used as a template for the PCR amplification of the full MS2 genome in three overlapping fragments. PCR reactions were performed using \u2018Phusion High-Fidelity DNA-polymerase\u2019 (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions with the primers: 1F (GGGTGGGACCCCTTTCGG), 1R (TTTTTCTAGAGAGCCGTTGCCT), 2F (GGCCCAAATCTCAGCCATGC), 2R (CGTGTCTGATCCACGGC), 3F (GGCACAAGTTGCAGGATGCA), 3R (TGGGTGGTAACTAGCCAAGCAG), see Supplementary Figure S6. After PCR, the three amplicons were purified with a PCR clean up kit (Promega). Purified amplicons were quantified with Qubit assays (Q33216, Life Technologies), diluted and pooled in equimolar concentrations. The Illumina Nextera XT library preparation protocol and kit were used to produce DNA libraries, according to manufacturer instructions with some modifications. Briefly, the tagmentation reaction was performed with 0.8 ng/\u03bcl of DNA, 10 \u03bcl TD Buffer, 5 \u03bcl ATM enzyme and up to 5 \u03bcl DDW. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 55\u00b0C and then directly used as a template for 50 \u03bcl PCR reaction using \u2018Phusion High-Fidelity DNA- polymerase\u2019 (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions with the index primers from the Nextera XT kit. After PCR, a double sized selection was performed using Ampure beads to remove short and long library fragments, since 350 bp fragments were required. We collected the supernatant and read 2 \u03bcl from each sample in the TapeStation (Agilent high sensitives D1000) to verify fragment size. The yeast enolase sample was prepared as described for the phage RNA. RT and PCR amplification were performed using primers: E1 (ATGGCTGTCTCTAAAGTTTACGCTA) and E2 (TTACAACTTGTCACCGTGGTGG).

We altered the supplied reverse transcriptase adapter (RTA) (22), which has a T10 overhang, to specifically target the MS2 genome with 22 nucleotides complementary to the MS2 conserved 3\u2032 end (Supplementary Figure S6). The ligation reaction was performed with 500 ng RNA in 9 \u03bcl, 100 nM costume adapter in 1 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcl of NEBNext Quick Ligation Buffer and 1.5 \u03bcl of T4 DNA Ligase enzyme (NEB).

The cDNA synthesis step was performed in order to maintain the RNA fragments integrity during MinION library prep and sequencing. The library was cleaned up each time using 2 \u03bcl of AMPure XP DNA beads per 1 \u03bcl of sample and we added 3 \u03bcl of RNase OUT (Thermo Scientific) to protect the RNA. The RNA was directly sequenced on the MinION nanopore sequencing device using a FLO-MIN107 flow cell equipped with the R9.5 chemistry. The MinKNOW control software version 1.14.1 was used and was allowed to proceed for 48 h. The basecalling was performed locally by the Miniknow software as well, and the data was written out in the FASTQ format. Reads were filtered with the MiniKNOW default cutoff of a minimum average q-score of 7. The AccuNGS pipeline (34) described above was next applied to the data in order to determine variant frequencies. BLAST parameters were modified to minimal % identity = 60, e-value threshold = 1E\u221207 and no q-score cutoff, to allow the highly variable minion reads to map. As with the Illumina results, 30 positions from each end of the genome were excluded from downstream analysis. This also solved the problem of very low coverage areas in the MinION sequencing.",

The method is based on five stages:Detecting non-random associations. For each pair of positions, a read is classified into four categories based on whether the read bears the WT nucleotide (i.e., identical to the reference genome) or non-WT nucleotide (i.e., different from the reference genome) at each of the two given positions. We use this to create a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency matrix of observed counts, which is then used as the input for a chi-square test and a resulting chi-square statistic (see supplementary text). We focus only on contiguous reads that spanned the entire genome. Notably at this stage we focus only on WT versus non-WT assignments (rather than the exact identity of the non-WT allele) for computational tractability.

First, for every single nucleotide variant, we group together all of the haplotypes that include this base variant (a haplotype can appear in more than one group). Second, in each group, we compute the relative frequency of each haplotype as its proportion of all haplotypes in the group. We iterate through the haplotypes from highest frequency to lowest, classifying each haplotype as reliable or not. The first haplotype is automatically classified as reliable. For every haplotype, we compare its relative frequency with the probability that it is created by technical errors from the closest haplotype classified as reliable, called its parent haplotype, using the inferred error threshold. For example, if a haplotype has an additional deletion and substitution when compared to its parent haplotype, we require that its relative frequency be higher than the product of 0.214 \u00d7 0.237 = 0.051 to be classified as reliable (using the 95th percentile error frequencies in Table 1). We iterate through the haplotypes until classifying all the haplotypes in each group.

Second, we are interested in inferring haplotypes, i.e. which mutations reside together regularly on the same genomes and which do not. Once again, the high error rate makes this extremely tricky since we observe reads bearing almost all possible combinations of mutations. In fact, most reads bore so many variants, that \u223c15\u201320% of the bases called per read were different than the reference (Supplementary Figure S5). In this case, we used a two-pronged approach: we first focused only on variants inferred as true mutations using our method, AssociVar, as described above. Second, we used the inferred error threshold to infer the probability of two or more variants residing erroneously on the same genome, utilizing an iterative approach in which we compare a given haplotype to haplotypes already classified as reliable (Materials and Methods). In our case, because the MS2 populations bore many mutations at low frequencies, we also limited the analysis to variants that appeared at a frequency of at least 5% in the MinION sequencing results.",

We note that this requires more caution, since our analysis of MS2 showed that spurious associations between mutations may be created artifactually by the sequencing process itself. Use of AssociVar without a control sequence requires the user to specify the threshold of the normalized chi square statistic.

We note that we cannot distinguish haplotypes/strains that differ from each other at one position only, because our method relies on the association between two positions containing real mutations. Similarly, if two strains differ at very proximal loci, AssociVar will also fail, since we filter out associations between mutations that are <15 base pairs apart. We postulate that the presumably artifactual associations we observed between proximal loci are induced by the RNA (or DNA) passing through the pore of the sequencer. Finally, we also noted specific patterns of mutations that were reproduced between our control sequence and the two evolved populations of MS2. This suggests two possibilities: first, perhaps sequence context and/or RNA secondary structure induce specific errors in MinION, and second, it is possible that MS2 genomes undergo RNA modifications and these are the cause of these specific errors. MinION direct RNA sequencing records the raw electric signal produced by the RNA going through the pores, and this potentially offers the opportunity to identify RNA modifications using a newly developed tool called Tombo (version 1.5) by Oxford Nanopore (https://nanoporetech.github.io/tombo/). Unfortunately, we could not conclusively determine the presence or effect of RNA modifications and its relationship to associated mutations. Our results suggest that Tombo still suffers from a high false positive rate, while the true positive rate of the method has not yet been determined (38). The former was demonstrated herein by a high number of presumably modified sites found in the enolase yeast gene, despite the fact this gene was created synthetically in vitro, where modifications would not likely occur. We nevertheless analyzed our MS2 samples and found a similar pattern of presumable modifications among the three MS2 samples, yet there was no correlation between sites with a high rate of modification and sites with high normalized chi scores by AssociVar (see supplementary text, Supplementary Figures S7\u2013S10). While we cannot rule out that RNA modifications are responsible for the pattern of errors in MinION, we conclude that further research is required to determine which factors induce these errors.",

Each dot represents the normalized chi-square statistic between a given variant and another variant at a position more than 15 bp apart. Associations marked in blue are classified as non-significant. Associations marked as green are true positives, where the position in the genome they identify is a real mutation as verified by Illumina sequencing. Associations marked as red identify positions that are false positives and do not have real mutations according to the Illumina results (one position for p15A and two positions for p15B). The red line illustrates the cutoff defined by the control sequence. Notably, the blue dots above the line are positions near real mutations, removed by AssociVar via the requirement for a local maximum (Materials and Methods).",

Two positions stand out as having a high association with each other, 363 and 606, evident by the two high peaks in the figure (green). Notably, other high associations were ruled out as induced by proximity with the local maximum analysis (Materials and Methods). Since we do not have a control sample for this gene, we cannot use it to infer a cutoff. However, the association between these two positions is so prominent when compared to the rest of the data that we were able to conclude they are between positions with \u2018true\u2019 variation (as later verified by Illumina).",

Performance of prediction of mutations is assessed using ROC curves, where each curve is plotted as a function of the normalized chi-square statistic threshold for AssociVar (solid lines), or frequency threshold for the na\u00efve method (dashed lines). The Illumina results are used as the gold standard test to define a mutation as true or false, and the three different colors represent different thresholds for this definition. For example, for the blue line labeled as 10%, only mutations at a frequency higher than 10% according to Illumina are defined as true.",
