It should not be forgotten, however, that sampling inadequacies are the prime reason for failure to identify aetiology. It is well recognised that, for most respiratory viruses, the delay in transport of the specimen to the laboratory is usually the major factor in both slowness of the process and a failure to make a diagnosis. There has been some success in applying near-patient testing. This has, in general, made the diagnosis of respiratory tract virus infection more reliable and speedier. It has had particular use in differentiating respiratory syncytial virus cases who might need admission from other causes of viral respiratory tract infection.",

For lower respiratory tract bacterial infections, sputum is the gold standard specimen, but the quality of the specimen is key because oral and gastrointestinal secretions may contaminate it. Ideally, there should be fewer than 10 squamous cells and greater than 25 leukocytes in a low power (\u00d7100 magnification) field. A report on the Gram stain provides the initial \u2018diagnosis\u2019 for empirical therapy. In practice, patients with COPD are able to provide satisfactory samples, but this is less often the case with patients who have pneumonia. In one study, only a third of 250 patients with clinically-diagnosed acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to hospital had Gram-stained smears which were useful for diagnostic purposes3. With Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in which unproductive cough is common, induction of sputum with nebulised 3% salt solution in 10% N-acetylcysteine has been tried with moderate success. In difficult cases, transtracheal aspiration, transthoracic needle biopsy and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) have also been used. Of these more invasive techniques, there has been the best validation of BAL, but even this sample has the potential to be contaminated from the upper respiratory tract and strict diagnostic criteria should be used with the same organism being found either in another bodily fluid and/or by another specimen.",

PCR can effect a diagnosis in less than 24 h. The extreme sensitivity of PCR is useful if the clinical features are suggestive, but if these are ambiguous may cause confusion. Positive results may occur because of latent virus, which is common in adults. The likeliest benefit will come from examining material from neonates and clinical specimens that would not normally harbour the virus.

It is helpful to be cognisant of this variation for a number of reasons: (i) to identify the spread of outbreaks; (ii) to understand the natural epidemiology of viruses including animal reservoirs; and (iii) to develop more effective vaccines. As genetic variation is a precursor of antigenic variation, subtler differences can best be detected by genome analysis. Multisegmented viruses exhibit gross changes by variation in size of those segments: these can be visualised by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The genomes of large DNA viruses can be analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping (see below) if sufficient virus is available. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting is a useful method for typing RNA genomes. Digestion of the genome with an enzyme, such as ribonuclease T1, for defined periods results in fragments which can be separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis.

RT then acts as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase to extend from one probe binding site to the other. One probe primer has a T7 promoter site incorporated so that this enzyme can then produce a further RNA copy to allow the process to start again. Typically, a 109 amplification can be achieved.

The principle of subtraction involves the removal of common sequences in infected and non-infected material with complex sequences. When two samples of broadly similar sequences are compared, the control source is termed the \u2018driver\u2019 and the experimental (infected) source termed the \u2018tester\u2019. In general, a large excess of driver dsDNA is allowed to hybridise to single-stranded tester nucleic acid. Any non-hybridised single-stranded tester nucleic acid can be separated as presumed unique sequences. Subsequent gene amplification can be achieved by adding unique linkers to all nucleic acids. One of these methods, representational differential analysis (RDA) has been used to identify a novel herpes virus from a vascular tumour common in AIDS patients, Kaposi's sarcoma9. RDA simultaneously combines amplification and subtraction. After restriction enzyme digestion to reduce genome complexity, linkers are added to the products to enable subsequent PCR amplification. Smaller fragments are amplified most efficiently. Thus the resulting amplicons may represent only a proportion (typically 10%) of the DNA restriction fragments. By the judicious use of single restriction enzymes for digestion of the genome, it is possible to produce amplicons that represent the entire genome. This is done for both tester and driver DNA. Subsequent steps in the RDA process are shown in Figure 2. RDA is being applied to a number of diseases of potential viral aetiology.\n",

As with other probe methods, in situ PCR is becoming the advancement of choice. In situ PCR can be direct or indirect. Indirect methods involve adding standard PCR reagents to the fixed cells and then post-amplification the products are detected by standard in situ hybridisation.

The plasmids usually characterised are those that confer antimicrobial resistance, termed R (for resistance)-factors. These have been shown to be useful epidemiological markers of the spread of nosocomial infection within hospital settings23.

Gene probes can be used to determine the presence of genetic sequences coding for resistance or chromosome; if the latter, it may be possible to combine detection of the organism and determination of antibiotic resistance simultaneously. A number of genes responsible for antibiotic resistance have now been identified (Table 3). One of the best characterised is the mecA gene of Staph. aureus. This gene encodes a penicillin-binding protein and is present in the majority of methicillin-resistant isolates of Staph. aureus (MRSA), but absent in those that are susceptible. Detection of the mecA gene correlates strongly with phenotypic determination of resistance. In one study, in which the mecA gene was detected using PCR, 42 of 46 isolates of Staph. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis that were mecA-positive were also methicillin resistant26. Bacterial cells were lysed then genetic material directly probed and amplified within one single day. This enables appropriate infection control measures and antibiotic therapy, if required, to be instituted more rapidly than by conventional methods. The cost of the methodology is more than outweighed by the potential savings in health resource.\n",

The shedding patterns correlated consistently with clinical outcome even though the organisms were not reliably detected by cytology29.
