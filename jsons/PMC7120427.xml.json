Without follow-up afterwards, 12% of ICU-associated infections were not recorded [27].In Belgium, there were 6500 ICU patients examined in 2010 [28]. Nosocomial pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) starting in the ICU were 13/1000 and 12/1000 patient days, respectively, and ICU-associated blood infections were 3.2/1000 patient days. During the period 1997\u20132010, ICU-associated infections increased, while infections related to equipment (respirator, catheter) were reduced [28]. In 2010, at least 31% of adult ICU patients had nosocomial infections [29].Later studies showed that more than 10% of ICU patients had infections like VAP and catheter-associated infections [30]. Among 78, 200 patients with more than 2 days of stay in 525 ICUs in 6 European countries from 2005 to 2008, it was estimated that 52% of the VAP cases and 69% of bloodstream infections could be prevented [30].Intensive studies in the United States show that 65\u201370% of catheter-associated blood and urinary tract infections can be prevented and 55% of cases of VAP and postoperative wound infections [31].The American network study (2013) of catheter-associated intravascular and urinary tract infections, VAP and postoperative wound infections showed that these four infection categories caused 70,000 hospital infections per year, and it was found at least 81,000 pathogenic microbes in these patients [32]. Nearly 20% of the microbes were multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) like MRSA, VRE, ESBL and CRE isolates [32].",

            "text": "\nIn 2010, ca. 300 general intensive beds were registered at 44 hospital ICUs in Norway (five million inhabitants) [33]. In 2013 it was about 15, 200 ICU treatments and approximately 60,300 days of intensive care in Norway are distributed between local hospitals 28.6%; central hospitals, 34.5%; and regional hospitals, 36.9% [34].More than half of the patients were on respiratory treatment, average stay in the ICU was 4 days, and 82.8% were discharged from hospital, while 11% died on the ICU and 6.2% on other wards [34].There is a calculated need for about 11 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants [35]. Calculated from today\u2019s approximately 350 intensive beds, this amounts to 5.8/100,000.In 2015, the prevalence of hospital infections in the Norwegian ICUs was 23% in surgical ICU/postoperative ward (218 beds) and 11.5% in medical ICU/ward of monitoring (192 beds) [36]. About the same results were recorded in 2013 [36].Hospital infections and mortality are high in Norwegian ICUs, especially in surgical ICUs. Since postoperative beds are included in the number registered for intensive, the real number of hospital infections is probably much higher. The costs are uncertain but probably amounts to at least 36,000 NKr per day for regular intensive care. The presence of resistant microbes in Norwegian ICUs is unknown but probably an increasing problem.There are still too few ICU beds in Norway\u2014maybe only half of what is needed\u2014and this can lead to unnecessary disease and death [35]. Every 6th (17%) ICU patient died on intensive or afterwards on ward in 2013 [34]. The risk of death in ICU is therefore very high.\n",

            "text": "Among 400 hospitalized patients in Germany, 18.5% were colonized with fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (FQREC), and this was linked to poor clinical outcomes and high mortality [56]. Stay in hospital, cancer diagnosis and the use of first-generation cephalosporin or cefepime treatment increased the incidence of new colonization with FQREC [56]. Isolation, good hygienic measures and a better antibiotic policy reduce the spread of infection. Fluoroquinolone resistance is an increasing problem since these drugs are used extensively both inside and outside hospitals [55].",
