An estimated 25 percent of calves experience respiratory illness in the first year of life [1], [2]. BRD is a multi-factorial disease caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens [3]. Several viruses, including bovine herpes virus-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and bovine coronavirus have been implicated in the initiation of BRD. These in turn predispose cattle to severe secondary infection by bacterial pathogens such as Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, and Arcanobacterium pyogenes\n[3].",

H. somni is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide variety of clinical syndromes such as pneumonia, reproductive disease, polyarthritis, septicemia, myocarditis and an acute neurological disease known as thrombotic meningoencephalitis [4], [5]. Despite being a normal resident of the microflora, H. somni has a variety of virulence factors including phosphocholine modification, phase variation of its lipooligosacchride (LOS), exopolysacchride production and secreted immunoglobulin Fc binding proteins such as IbpA [6]. H. somni also inhibits oxygen radical formation by bovine leukocytes [5]. Co-incubation of H. somni with bovine alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes and neutrophils reduces the ability of these cells to phagocytose, produce oxygen radicals and kill the bacteria. Those H. somni cells that are phagocytosed appear to survive within the leukocytes despite the production of nitric oxide [5]. Viable H. somni cells, but not killed cells nor culture supernatant, impair leukocyte function [5].",

Upon formation, NETs can trap and kill a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, protozoa [18] and viruses [19]. NET formation results in little or no lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, indicating that necrosis is not the chief cause of DNA release [7]. Similarly, NET formation occurs in the presence of inhibitors of apoptosis [20], [21].",

Mast cells also produce ETs containing nuclear DNA, histones, tryptase, and cathelicidin LL-37 in response to Streptococcus pyogenes\n[25]. Interestingly, eosinophils produce ET composed of mitochondrial DNA rather than nuclear [24]; although, some have demonstrated mitochondrial DNA is also found in NETs produced by neutrophils that do not die in the process of NET formation [27], [28]. Despite some differences between leukocyte traps, several authors have confirmed the ability of these ETs to trap and kill pathogens [20], [23], [24], [25], [26].",

We observed a dose- and time-dependent increase in NET formation in response to purified H. somni vesicles (Fig. 3\n). Various molecules are found in OMVs including LOS, immunoglobulin-binding protein (IbpA) and others [6]. The ability of lipopolysacchride (LPS) to cause NET formation has been controversial, with some authors demonstrating a need for a second stimulus [28], [34]. Recently, purified LOS from nontypable Haemophilus influenzae was reported to cause NET formation by human neutrophils [35]. We did not observe NET formation when bPMNs were incubated with various concentrations of LOS (kind gift from Dr. Inzana) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (data not shown). Nontypable H. influenzae LOS required 5 h of incubation to trigger NET formation [35]. We tried various concentrations (10 pg\u201370 \u03bcg) of H. somni LOS for up to 8 h and did not observe NET formation at any concentration or time point (data not shown). These data indicate that OMVs cause NET formation, but LOS alone is not the causative agent.",

In particular, M. haemolytica, a primary bacterial pathogen that causes BRD, has been shown to cause NET and MET formation [20], [21]. NET formation is believed to be an active form of cell death that is independent of necrosis and apoptosis. Extracellular DNA release by bPMNs in response to H. somni cells occurred without significant release of LDH, implicating NET formation rather than necrosis as the cause for extracellular DNA (Fig. 1). Similarly, cytochalasin D did not significantly diminish NET formation in response to H. somni cells (Fig. 1), which others have argued is a hallmark for NETosis [7], [9]. Nor was NET formation significantly diminished when the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-FAD-FMK, was added to inhibit apoptosis (data not shown) [9]. The amount of extracellular DNA was reduced when bovine DNase I was incubated with NETs produced in response to H. somni cells (Fig. 1). Repeated exposure to H. somni cells (hourly for up to 6 h) further increased NET formation without a significant increase in LDH release (Fig. 2). M. haemolytica, another BRD pathogen, elicits a similar response when bPMNs are repeatedly exposed to M. haemolytica cells [21].",

            "text": "An important virulence factor for H. somni is its truncated lipopolysacchride, LOS, which has been shown to activate caspase-3 and -8 and induce apoptosis in bovine endothelial cells [36], [37], [38]. LOS has also been demonstrated to induce platelet aggregation and activation leading to endothelial cell death and a proinflammatory response [39], [40], [41], [42]. Interestingly, NET formation was not observed in response to purified H. somni LOS at various concentrations (10 pg\u201370 \u03bcg) nor for various lengths of time (10 min\u20138 h) (data not shown). Our findings differ from a report that found LOS purified from H. influenzae causes NET formation in a model of otitis media [35], and alters the ability of NETs to kill H. influenzae cells. Mutants of H. influenzae, with LOS core and lipid A assembly defects, were more susceptible to NET killing than H. influenzae with native LOS. These date indicate that LOS may cause NET formation, but the NETs formed are limited in their ability to kill H. influenzae cells [43]. H. influenzae\n[44], [45], [46] and H. somni\n[47], [48], [49] both undergo random phase and antigenic variation of the LOS in vitro or in response to the specific host immune response leading to changes in the composition or structure of the LOS [50], [51], [52]. H. somni LOS can also be modified by the addition of phosphorylcholine, which has been demonstrated to be important for colonization of the bacteria to bovine upper respiratory tract [32] and platelet aggregation [39]. Here, we did not observe NET formation in response to LOS purified from H. somni 649, which produces LOS with phosphorylcholine modifications.",

We examined whether H. somni OMVs, containing outer membrane proteins and cytosolic components, could cause NET formation. We found that H. somni OMVs stimulated NET formation in a dose- and time-dependent response, although the response varied among experiments (Fig. 3). Corbeil and colleagues [60], [61], [62] have demonstrated that recombinant immunoglobulin-binding protein (IbpA) subunits protect calves and mice from severe H. somni disease. Vaccination of calves with three subunits of IbpA (A3, A5, and DR2) led to a lower percentage of gross lesions and histological abnormalities than control calves and H. somni was not recovered from these pneumonic lesions [62]. Because IbpA is secreted in OMVs, future investigations could address the role of IbpA and other OMV proteins in NET formation.",

Incubation of NET with DNase I reduced DNA-mediated trapping and killing, indicating that most bacterial cells (>40%) were killed in NETs rather than by phagocytosis. Pre-incubation of bPMNs with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, did not significantly reduce the trapping and killing of H. somni cells. Cytochalasin D inhibits phagocytosis, but not NET formation, providing further evidence that most bacterial cells are trapped and killed via NET formation (Fig. 4). H. somni has been known to be rather resistant to killing via phagocytosis [5]. Perhaps NET formation is a more prominent form of controlling H. somni in vivo.",

            "text": "It has been long noted that BRD pathogens cause clusters of \u201cstreaming leukocytes\u201d within the alveoli of infected cattle [63], [64]. These elongated leukocytes with streaming nuclei are also referred to as \u201coat cells\u201d [63], [64] in which the origins of the streaming leukocytes were mostly produced from neutrophils, with some arising from macrophages [65]. Histological section of a BRD lung also showed extensive neutrophil infiltration and vast amounts of extracellular DNA that have been theorized to be produced by \u201cstreaming leukocytes\u201d [21]. Here, we provide photomicrographs that demonstrate elongated bPMNs having a similar morphological structure in vitro as previously reported as \u2018streaming leukocytes\u2019 [63], [64], [65], [66]. Extracellular DNA (i.e. \u201cstreaming nuclei\u201d) are seen that have trapped H. somni cells (Figs. 5 and 6 (see arrows)). Using confocal microscopy, we confirm that approximately 25\u201330 percent of bPMNs form NETs when incubated with H. somni cells, H. somni OMVs, or PMA, but not when incubated with H. somni LOS (Fig. 6). These data are similar to previous reports in which 10 to 33 percent of neutrophils underwent NET formation [8], [9], [21]. We infer that \u2018streaming leukocytes\u2019 and free DNA found in the alveolar spaces of BRD afflicted cattle [21] reflect in part NET formation elicited by BRD pathogens such as H. somni or M. haemolytica.",

            "text": "The benefits of NETs have been demonstrated primarily by their ability trap and kill various pathogens in vitro\n[18], [19]. However, it has been suggested that NETs may play a role in vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), systemic lupus erythematosous, pre-eclampsia, gout and arthritis [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75]. These observations may be relevant to the pathogenesis of H. somni infection, which produces a wide array of clinical syndromes including arthritis, vascular inflammation, multiple thrombotic lesions and an acute form of vasculitis called thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME). The latter is characterized by fibrinopurulent meningitis with abscess formation, hemorrhaging, and thrombotic vasculitis throughout the central nervous system that can result in death within 12\u201324 h after the onset of symptoms [4]. It has been demonstrated that deposition of NETs in inflamed kidneys, and circulating myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, can trigger vasculitis and promote an autoimmune response against neutrophil components [69]. Similarly, others have demonstrated that histones and chromatin, which are present in NETs, cause up regulation of thrombin leading to venous thrombi formation in mice that is similar to DVT seen in humans [76]. Interestingly, intravenous administration of histones exacerbated DVT formation, but administration of DNase I, which degrades NETs, protected mice from venous thrombosis [76]. Neutrophils from human cancer patients treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are sensitized to form NETs upon exposure to a second stimulus, leading to a prothrombotic state in these patients [71]. Platelet-induced NET formation has also been implicated in thrombus formation in a mouse model of transfusion-related acute lung injury, where the administration of an anti-histone antibody and DNase I protected mice for acute lung injury [77]. The connection between H. somni-induced vasculitis or TME and NET formation has not been addressed; however, further research should focus on how NETs may play a role in the vascular syndromes seen in H. somni infected animals. Perhaps, DNase I should be examined to determine if DNase I could alleviate vascular symptoms.",

            "text": "The results of this study provide a new perspective to older observations regarding the interactions of bovine neutrophils and macrophages with H. somni. Several reports indicated that bovine neutrophil function was inhibited by various components of H. somni (then called H. somnus) [78], [79], [80], [81], [82]. Despite being a somewhat fastidious organism in the laboratory, H. somni was resistant to killing by bovine neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes. This resistance was attributed to a weak oxidative burst by neutrophils in the presence of metabolically active H. somni, or high and low molecular weight fractions released from the organism [83]. Bovine macrophages also were ineffective at killing H. somni and could support limited intracellular multiplication of the organism [84]. Despite these in vitro observations, it is clear that host innate defense mechanisms are able to restrict growth of H. somni in the respiratory tract and at other sites, as the infections tend to be subacute rather than acute in onset (except for TME) [4], [5], [50]. The observations in the present study may illustrate one way in which neutrophils and macrophages can battle effectively with H. somni. If the organism triggers extracellular trap formation in vivo, similar to what was observed in vitro, this could provide one means by which the host restrains multiplication and slows the progression of H. somni infection.",
