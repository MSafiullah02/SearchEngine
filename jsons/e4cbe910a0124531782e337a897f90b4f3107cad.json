Two categories of mRNA constructs are being actively evaluated: non-replicating mRNA (NRM) and self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) constructs (Fig. 1 ). Both have in common a cap structure, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), an open-reading frame (ORF), and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. 3 SAM differs with the inclusion of genetic replication machinery derived from positive-stranded mRNA viruses, most commonly from alphaviruses such as Sindbis and Semliki-Forest viruses. 4, 5 Generally, the ORF encoding viral structural proteins is replaced by the selected transcript of interest, and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is retained to direct cytoplasmic amplification of the replicon construct. The potential merits of NRM versus SAM will be addressed later.",

Second, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR regions are important for maximizing gene expression. The length of the 3\u2032 UTR, 14 5\u2032 UTR structures, and regulatory elements in both UTRs 15 all impact efficiency. Third, the 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap of the mRNA molecule, linked via a triphosphate bridge to the first transcribed nucleotide, is essential for efficient translation, and blocks 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonucleasemediated degradation. The specific cap structure plays a critical role in both protein production and immunogenicity, with incomplete capping (5\u2032 triphosphate) and Cap 0 structures shown to stimulate RIG-1. [16] [17] [18] In addition, 2-O\u2032-unmethylated capped RNA can be sequestered by cellular IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT1) that prevent the initiation of translation, 19 or detected by the cytoplasmic RNA sensor MDA5. 20 Manufacturers of mRNA vaccines pay careful attention to the choice of enzyme and reaction conditions, in order to catalyze the highest percentage of cap formation. Fourth, the poly (A) tail and its properties such as length, are crucial for translation and protection of the mRNA molecule. 21, 22 Last, codon optimization and modification of nucleotides have contributed to translation efficiency. For example, optimization of guanine and cytosine (GC) content can have a significant impact, 23 and has been well established with DNA vaccines. The innate immune activation to mRNA can also influence its utility as a delivery system. The use of modified nucleosides, such as pseudouridine or N-1-methylpseudouridine to remove intracellular signaling triggers for protein kinase R (PKR) activation, resulted in enhanced antigen expression and adaptive immune responses. [24] [25] [26] It has been demonstrated that successful protein production, minimal undesired inflammatory responses, and systemic adaptive immune responses could be achieved preclinically by using unmodified mRNA 27 through a combination of optimizing the coding sequence and removal of any unwanted inflammatory impurities. 28, 29 Ultimately, comparative immunogenicity between these approaches require studies that control all potential factors, including the delivery system. Human studies \"head-to-head\" comparing modified and unmodified nucleoside mRNA constructs would confirm clinically relevant differences, if any. Similarly, controlled comparisons of the aforementioned NRM and SAM are needed to determine any distinctions. Until then, all the approaches-modified, unmodified, NRM, SAM, and combinations thereof-appear feasible, and are supported by preclinical data, although unmodified nucleoside constructs may be desirable for manufacturing efficiency and transcriptional fidelity. 30, 31 In addition to optimizing an mRNA construct, and of quintessential importance, is the delivery of the mRNA vaccine from the bolus at the injection site into the cytoplasm of cells for the initiation of translation. As mRNA is a transient molecule by nature that is susceptible to degradation primarily through nuclease activity, efficient protection is required. 32, 33 This has been an intense area of research in the field, for which lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are currently emerging as a leading category.",

At the time of writing, 12 clinical trials for mRNA-based infectious disease vaccines have been completed, or are at various stages of progression, building experience (see Table 1 ). All studies assess viral targets, many have been reviewed elsewhere recently. 64 The current focus from a clinical perspective is to optimize the benefit (immunogenicity and efficacy) while reducing the risk (safety) profile of a candidate mRNA vaccine by optimizing the quality attributes that dictate expression and/or augmenting delivery. It is clear that immune activation can be both advantageous and potentially detrimental, and has to be titrated accordingly. Thus, early-phase clinical trials need to be designed in a way to appropriately capture the inflammatory component intrinsic to all mRNA vaccines, given that several intracellular innate immune response sensors are activated by RNA. 65 Elements include measuring administration site reactions such as pain, tenderness-associated systemic reactions such as fever and malaise, and routine biochemical laboratory parameters (e.g., serum electrolytes, liver function test, and CBC). These parameters, when followed closely, can be designed to develop enrollment pause rules in the event that severe tolerability issues are observed in a clinical trial. 66 Detailed characterization of the immune response fully leveraging modern techniques such as transcriptomics and systems biology, in addition to traditional methods of immune monitoring, needs to be implemented. Several agency guidelines developed for the study of novel adjuvants in human subjects provide sufficient guidance that can be applied to mRNA candidate vaccines on how to monitor safety in early-phase clinical studies. 67 The data from early-phase clinical studies, particularly around local and self-limiting systemic reactogenicity, have been mixed. 68, 69 In fact, reporting of human trials has generally concluded that new formulations are required to optimize the profile. However, these early claims need further confirmation, and in many cases, complete datasets are still awaited. As mentioned above, multi-antigen approaches will only complicate the issue of establishing acceptable tolerability.",

As with novel adjuvants, an adequate safety database to assure safety for candidate mRNA vaccines is likely to be in the tens of thousands range.

Currently, the field is pursuing two approaches: non-replicating and self-replicating constructs. A number of quality attributes, that dictate stability and efficiency of expression, continue to be an intense area of development. It is widely recognized that the delivery of the mRNA into the cytoplasm is equally important to successfully elicit a robust and durable immunity. As a result, much progress has been achieved with considerable focus on novel ionizable lipid formulations and the next generation of delivery systems. The nature of mRNA technology allows rapid refinement with almost limitless combinations of derivatives in the pursuit of optimization. This necessitates the application of translational sciences to accelerate selection of the optimal construct and formulation for subsequent development. Clinical experience in the last 2 years is building upon the plethora of preclinical data generated. These trials have informed our understanding of the need to find the optimal balance between immune and inflammatory activation to establish an acceptable risk/benefit profile for a given vaccine. Whether clinical results from different sponsors will be generalizable for mRNA technologies and formulations remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Two categories of mRNA constructs are being actively evaluated. Non-replicating mRNA (NRM) constructs encode the coding sequence (CDS), and are flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), a 5\u2032-cap structure and a 3\u2032-poly-(A) tail. The self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) construct encodes additional replicase components able to direct intracellular mRNA amplification. (1) NRM and SAM are formulated in this illustration in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that encapsulate the mRNA constructs to protect them from degradation and promote cellular uptake. (2) Cellular uptake of the mRNA with its delivery system typically exploits membrane-derived endocytic pathways. (3) Endosomal escape allows release of the mRNA into the cytosol. (4) Cytosol-located NRM constructs are immediately translated by ribosomes to produce the protein of interest, which undergoes subsequent post-translational modification. (5) SAM constructs can also be immediately translated by ribosomes to produce the replicase machinery necessary for self-amplification of the mRNA. (6) Self-amplified mRNA constructs are translated by ribosomes to produce the protein of interest, which undergoes subsequent post-translational modification.(7)The expressed proteins of interest are generated as secreted, trans-membrane, or intracellular protein.(8) The innate and adaptive immune responses detect the protein of interest. Purity: removal of impuri\u019fes reduces innate sensing promo\u019fng expression. UTR's: transla\u019fonal efficiency is regulated by their length, Poly-A-tail: proper\u019fes such as length, are important for transla\u019fon and protec\u019fon of the mRNA molecule",
