One of the earliest recorded epidemics, the plague of Athens (also called the Thucydides syndrome), took place between 430 and 425 B.C.E. and is believed to have been an outbreak of Ebola virus (Olson et al. 1996) or typhoid fever (Papagrigorakis et al. 2006). Measles emerged in human populations after evolving from rinderpest, a disease of cattle, sometime around the eleventh or twelfth century, and perhaps the most famous disease outbreak in recorded history, the Black Death, was caused by plague (Yersinia pestis), a vector-borne zoonosis. In this sense, the emergence of diseases is a natural process, the by-product of pathogen \u201cchatter\u201d between susceptible host populations of different species, with the emergence of diseases into human populations only a small subset of the broader cross talk among mammals, and animals writ large.",

The majority of mammalian viruses lack the capacity to even infect humans, and the majority of spillover events that do occur fail to establish circulating infection in the new host. But despite the long and complex history of peoples and plagues, scientific consensus indicates that the rate of infectious disease emergence has been accelerating in more recent history. Differentiating the next pandemic from background noise is a nearly insurmountable challenge and one that is ongoing as new pathogens evolve or are discovered. As participants in clinically relevant research settings, the task of ecologists studying spillover revolves around three key issues:Describing the process of spillover and interactions and state changes between hosts, pathogens, and the environment that lead to disease emergenceDeveloping predictive conceptual and quantitative models that can explain spillover patterns and forecast disease emergence, epidemic behavior, and/or intervention impactApplying ecological and clinical knowledge to develop interventions that mitigate, control, and potentially prevent epidemics and pandemics\n",

We use this framework to evaluate a number of pathogens that illustrate key features important to the spillover process.

We define a zoonotic reservoir as one or more epidemiologically connected animal populations and/or environments where a pathogen can be maintained and transmitted to humans (Haydon et al. 2002) and, more broadly, domestic animals as well. Regardless of transmission mode, the process by which a pathogen moves from one host population (or environmental reservoir) to another host population is referred to as spillover and arises from complex bidirectional interactions among people, animals, pathogen communities, and environments. This is a key step in zoonotic disease emergence but remains poorly understood and often not explicitly quantified in transmission models (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009; Iacono et al. 2016), which tend to focus on dynamics within a single population.",

            "text": "Some of the most significant quantitative work at the spillover interface has focused not on predicting rates of zoonotic spillover but on identifying and predicting the common features of spillover diseases and the pathways they tend to exploit. Viruses have been best studied in this context; basic rules of thumb are well established, such that single-stranded RNA viruses are predisposed to become zoonoses, likely due to a predisposition toward evolvability and host switching. Other rules have emerged from studying the networks of viral transmission between different host groups and humans. For example, a study by Johnson et al. (2015) demonstrated a number of key rules, perhaps most importantly that viruses with greater host plasticity in animal reservoirs are more likely to demonstrate human-to-human transmissibility. Some virus families, such as arenaviruses and filoviruses, are predisposed to human-to-human transmission. Correspondingly, some groups of mammals were especially common reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, including rodents (especially for arena- and bunyaviruses), primates (retroviruses), and bats (paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses). Pathways of spillover were also noted to differ, with bush meat hunting being a notable source of exposure to nonhuman primate viruses, while proximity of homes to fields was a significant driver for exposure to rodent-borne viruses (Dearing and Dizney 2010). Although sometimes not considered a \u201cpathway of spillover,\u201d vectors can also act as a critical component in spillover dynamics with, for example, Johnson et al. showing that virus spillover from bird reservoirs was disproportionately vector borne.",

(2017) refined and elaborated these findings, confirming that RNA viruses are more commonly zoonotic and that the phylogenetic breadth of viral hosts is the strongest predictor of zoonotic potential (analogous to Johnson\u2019s findings about viral plasticity). Olival et al. also confirmed that bat viruses were disproportionately zoonotic, an unsurprising finding given that many well-known viruses have originated from bat reservoirs [e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses, and even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, likely, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)]. Olival et al. confirmed that viruses with arthropod vectors have a greater plasticity in their mammalian hosts and showed that viral replication in the cytoplasm also predicts zoonotic potential. Finally, their study shows that human population density in host ranges and the phylogenetic relatedness of wildlife reservoirs to humans were important predictors of zoonotic emergence. These aspects are likely related to the evolutionary processes that occur at the spillover interface, where viruses coevolve with new hosts and incrementally develop greater emergence potential over time (which we discuss below).",

Given the recent preponderance of devastating viral outbreaks, such as Ebola and Zika, it is unsurprising that so much attention has been paid to the factors that drive viral emergence. Comparatively less work has been done to consolidate these types of results for other major pathogen groups, like bacteria, protozoans, and fungi.

Whereas Stage III is characterized by short chains of transmission (\u201cstuttering chains\u201d), Stage IV features human-to-human sustained epidemic transmission. The line between the two is obviously not only subjective but may create difficulties when characterizing expected pathogen behavior. For example, outbreaks of Ebola virus beginning in 1976 were typically small and situated in rural areas where outbreaks could have been classified as Stage III. However, since 2014, Ebola has been considered a Stage IV zoonosis, and modeling work undertaken during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa showed that \u201cthe same epidemiological conditions that were present in 1976 could have generated a large outbreak purely by chance\u201d (Camacho et al. 2014).

Each of these compartments in the model is influenced by various factors and interactions (e.g., factors which influence the state of the host, pathogen, and environment and the resultant interactions; see Table 8.1 for examples), as well as the processes of source-host contact, intensity and duration of exposure, pathogen invasion potential for individual hosts (i.e., interactions between pathogens and the immune system), and onward transmission and adaptation within host populations. We find it insightful to consider pathogen spillover as typically involving four conceptually distinct, transmission processes: spillover from the reservoir component (RC) directly to the focal host component (FHC) (i.e., spillover boundary 1, SB1), spillover from the RC to the intermediary host/vector component (IHC) (i.e., spillover boundary 2, SB2), spillover from the IHC to the FHC (i.e., spillover boundary 3, SB3), and host-to-host transmission within the FHC itself.\n",

Transmission across SB2 often presents an important bottleneck to pathogens ultimately entering FHC. Transmission across SB3 is generally the focal spillover process, particularly those vectored by mosquitoes and parasites. Transmission across these spillover boundaries may either result in a dead-end infection of a focal host, a stuttering transmission chain in the focal host (R\n0 < 1 in FHC), or an epidemic outbreak (R\n0 necessarily > 1 in FHS). One or more such outbreaks may lead to adaptation and FHC endemicity.",

Emergence within the FHC (i.e., a zoonotic outbreak) requires that novel host(s) then transmit the pathogen to other members of the same species, with the degree of onward transmission determining the nature of the epidemic in the FHC. In some cases, pathogens may routinely spillover without resulting in any onward transmission in the FHC. In this case, the novel host is a dead end, and the epidemic is purely driven by spillover events. In humans, we see examples of this with anthrax and rabies. Once a spillover proceeds to include direct focal host-to-host transmission, if R\n0 < 1, the process ends in a transmission chain that has a geometric distribution with an expected length of (1 \u2212 1/R\n0) (distribution of chains that arise from several such transmission events is referred to as stuttering chains, Antia et al. 2003). On the other hand, if R\n0 > 1, then the probability of an epidemic outbreak in FHC rises steeply with the value of R\n0 (Antia et al. 2003).",

This is the case for West Nile virus (WNV) where RC is maintained by a passerine bird and Culex mosquitoes host-vector system but where Aedes mosquitoes are an intermediary host/vector component (Kilpatrick 2011; Petersen et al. 2013). Thus, when humans get bitten by WNV-infected Culex individuals, transmission can be regarded as direct (i.e., occurring across SB1); but when humans get bitten by WNV-infected Aedes individuals, transmission can be regarded as indirect with the pathogen needing to cross both SB2 and SB3 to be transferred from RC to FHC. The reason for this discussion relates to how we ultimately use our model to assess probabilities of outbreaks of zoonotic disease in humans and other focal species of interest.",

Deciding on the appropriate level of detail to include in a model depends on the questions to be addressed and an understanding of the processes needed in the model to adequately address these questions. In our framework, we assume that little is known about the structure and dynamics of the reservoir. Thus, we simply represent the reservoir in terms of a spatiotemporal risk-of-infection function R (x, t), where x is a point in space (typically 2D) and t is a point in time. More ambitiously, we endeavor to represent the intermediary host in terms of both its population density Y (x, t) and the prevalence of infection IY (x, t) over space and time. Calculation of PY (x, t) in terms of R (x, t) and Y (x, t) represents the real challenge, particularly if the impacts of various critical factors, as elaborated in the sections below, are to be incorporated. The primary focus is on the IHC where most of the interesting dynamics take place prior to an outbreak within the FHC. Once an outbreak begins in the focal host population, then the emphasis switches to the dynamics of infection within the FHC.

Without going into detail regarding age, sex, or spatial structure, the dynamics of this population should minimally be described by a model that includes a demographic recruitment process (e.g., births and immigration), a natural mortality process, a pathogen exposure process, a disease class structure (e.g., susceptible S, infected but not yet infectious E, infectious I, recovered with some level of immunity R that may wane over time), a disease-induced mortality process, and a disease progression transfer matrix.

Contact itself requires an understanding of host behavioral and movement ecology, while dose-exposure computations require explicit characterization of the pathogen encounter risk distribution function R (x, t) introduced above. Note that the movement of susceptible individuals in IHC may alter their movement behavior in response to the distribution of R (x, t), as is the case for anthrax. Finally the probability of succumbing to infection given a contact (C) of intensity w and duration \u03c4 will depend on the immunological state of the susceptible in IHC. If a susceptible is immunologically naive, then we would expect the probability of succumbing to be given by a function C (w, \u03c4) that has the following properties: C (0, \u03c4) = 0 for all \u03c4 \u2265 0 and C (w, 0) = 0 for all w \u2265 0 imply no dose and no transfer; C (w, \u03c4) \u2265 0 is an increasing function of w for fixed \u03c4 and of \u03c4 for fixed w but is constrained to satisfy C (w, \u03c4) \u2264 1 for all w \u2265 0 and \u03c4 \u2265 0; and, most importantly, C (w, k) is an increasing function of w when w\u03c4 = k.

With recent advances in RNA and DNA sequencing technology, we now have the ability to trace the lineage of pathogens that have high mutational rates, in particular single-stranded RNA viruses (Duffy et al. 2008) within families such as the Coronaviridae (including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), Flaviviridae (e.g., yellow fever, West Nile, dengue, Zika, and hepatitis C viruses), and Filoviridae (Ebola virus and Marburg virus). Monitoring molecular data over time allows an opportunity to assess the spillover rates of viruses across SB1 and SB3. Genetic sequences from pathogens originating in RC and IHC are necessary here but not always available. Contact tracing can also be used in human populations to infer whether transmission is primary (i.e., across SB1 or SB3) or secondary (i.e., human-to-human within FHC). Finally, once secondary transmission has been identified in the FHC, then contact tracing can also be used to construct next-generation distributions where estimates of R\n0 can be developed. Only if R\n0 > 1 can an outbreak occur, and even then if R\n0 > 1 is close to 1, epidemic fade-out may be more likely than an epidemic outbreak (Parrish et al. 2008; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005).",

The value of R\n0 can be reduced by shortening the period of infectiousness, decreasing the rate of new infections, or by increasing pathogen mortality (Hudson et al. 2008). In a full FHC epidemic with eventual fade-out, host factors themselves may drive the process through changes in contact behavior, treatment, and/or other interventions that reduce R\n0, leading to fade-out and cessation of the epidemic. For example, interventions such as quarantining infected individuals limited the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 to fewer than 10,000 cases, even though the international travel of infected individuals puts hundreds of millions of individuals at risk (Smith 2006). Alternatively, the pathogen may establish itself in the new host population, sustained by secondary transmission, leading ultimately to endemic infection (e.g., HIV/AIDS; see below) or eventual epidemic fade-out. In the latter case, the pathogen cannot persist in the population as might happen, for example, when the proportion of susceptible individuals has been greatly reduced by the action of the epidemic itself [e.g., 1918 influenza pandemic, \u201cthe Spanish flu\u201d (Taubenberger and Morens 2006)]. Ultimately, it is the convergence and interplay of specific factors from the involved compartments and host-pathogen interactions that will determine if pathogen transmission will successfully occur and the nature of the resultant epidemic(s).",

Here, various factors can influence the outcome of exposure. External forcings such as climate or extreme weather events are able to drive host and pathogen distributions and disease occurrence (Alexander et al. 2012b). For example, El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation events have been linked to increases in the number of Yersinia pestis flea vectors and rodent host populations, leading to increased pathogen invasion and mortality in prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and colony extinction events (Stapp et al. 2004). Likewise, human behavior can influence domestic animal pathogen exposure to wildlife. For example, cattle herding behavior of dog owners influenced contact between African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and domestic dogs, exposing the wild dogs to canine pathogens and causing catastrophic declines in wild dog populations (Alexander and McNutt 2010).",

This is the case for all human diseases that have clear origins in wildlife populations. For example, non-synonymous changes in the Spike gene were found only in SARS viruses where sustained human-to-human transmission occurred. These genetic changes were not found in viruses circulating in the reservoir host (palm civets; Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) or in those spillover viruses that did not successfully move to the FHC where sustained human-to-human transmission occurred (Pepin et al. 2010). A more dramatic case is HIV-AIDS that has two different simian sources, resulting in two distinct groups of HIV pathogens: one from gorillas (Gorilla gorilla; HIV-1) and the other from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys; HIV-2) (Lemey et al. 2003; Keele et al. 2006).",

For example, in diseases such as rabies (Zinsstag et al. 2009) and brucellosis (Zinsstag et al. 2005), where R\n0 in humans is zero, we often find calculations of R\n0 developed for reservoir populations, without any explicit quantitative consideration of the magnitude of spillover into the FHC. This is also seen in a recent paper that explicitly models dog-to-human transmission for rabies (Zinsstag et al. 2009), including the development of clinical disease in both human and dog populations. R\n0 is calculated for dog-to-dog transmission in IHC, but no specification of spillover rates across SB3 is made. This tells us that there is sustained transmission in the dog population, prior to any introduction of interventions; but the estimated dog-to-human contact rate is never used to provide an explicit corresponding estimation of the size of the spillover event. In the context of vector-borne diseases, a similarly approached assessment can be found with Plasmodium knowlesi transmission from monkeys to humans through Anopheles leucosphyrus mosquitoes, an interesting example of spillover (Cox-Singh and Singh 2008). A recent model of this system (Yakob et al. 2010) could be usefully extended to include the elaboration of spillover values: monkeys to humans and humans back to monkeys, in both cases through mosquitoes. Incorporation of such measures would be useful in understanding and characterizing the dynamic process of disease emergence.",

This threshold may disappear when frequency-dependent transmission predominates (Getz and Pickering 1983), as is the case for sexually transmitted diseases. Establishment of the pathogen will only occur if the necessary threshold density of susceptible individuals is identified and is required to ensure that R\n0 \u2265 1; otherwise, failing to have the necessary density of susceptibles, the pathogen will fade out with R\n0 < 1. Disease control or eradication efforts are then focused on using this threshold principle to manipulate pathogen fade-out in the new host population through the reduction of susceptibles as, for example, with H1N1 and the use of vaccination and school closures to control the outbreak. However, R\n0 and H\nT do not apply to transmission across spillover boundaries SB1 and SB3 where primary transmission of zoonotic disease occurs. These concepts are, by definition, only applicable to the transmission within the reservoir or spillover host populations themselves. Further, spillover and onward transmission differ in an important respect: spillover is a series of onetime events, while onward transmission can either lead to stuttering chains, involving small groups of individuals from the animal and human populations interacting in the FHC, or full-blown outbreaks. Consequently, relative to time, the accumulation of spillover events is a linear process coupled to the nonlinear exponential processes of transmission in the reservoir and spillover host populations (Fig. 8.2). To assess the potential for outbreaks in the FHC, we need estimates of both spillover rates across SB1 and SB3, as well as estimates of the R\n0 that will ensue once host-to-host transmission is established in the FHC.\n",

Human health objectives are focused on minimizing and preventing human morbidity and mortality associated with zoonotic disease transmission, and control efforts are directed at reducing or even eliminating initial spillover events. This public health perspective highlights the importance of characterizing spillover both qualitatively and quantitatively. Many emerging zoonotic pathogens present as a spillover epidemic only in the human population with R\n0 = 0 (e.g., anthrax) or a mixed epidemic type where there is spillover with highly inefficient human-to-human transmission (R\n0 < 1 in the human host, e.g., monkeypox virus). The immediate focus of control for many emerging zoonoses is not the reduction of infectious animals in the reservoir populations (the reservoir species may not even be known) but minimizing human behaviors and other factors that are thought to contribute to pathogen exposure and invasion risk in humans (e.g., Ebola; see below). In these instances, R\n0 in the human or in the reservoir population is not the central factor of interest. Rather, we need to focus on the complex processes of zoonotic pathogen spillover that must occur in the first place. Quantifying spillover rates provides information on the number of cases that can be expected in the FHC over time, a process that is not captured by the traditional R\n0 in either the IHC or FHC.",

Infection may be from either direct ingestion of spores from soil or contaminated vegetation (primarily in grazing herbivores), ingestion of leaves contaminated with blowfly emesis (primarily for browsers) (Blackburn et al. 2010; Braack and De Vos 1990), or direct inoculation from biting flies (Blackburn 2010; Krishna et al. 1958; Blackburn et al. 2014b). Though poorly studied, animal inhalation of spores is not implausible (Turnbull et al. 1998). It has been suggested that during large epizootics, high case numbers of a primary species (e.g., American bison; Bison bison) may cause enough environmental contamination that secondary host species (e.g., moose, Alces alces, or elk, Cervus canadensis) may succumb later in the outbreak (Fig. 8.3a) (Hugh-Jones and Blackburn 2009; Dragon et al. 1999). Specific mechanisms for transmission remain poorly understood and require further research. Human infection is considered secondary and often linked with handling contaminated carcasses or slaughtering infected animals (Woods et al. 2004) and therefore constrained to the spillover. The spatial boundaries of the spillover are limited by the distribution of environmental conditions that support the pathogen; though when livestock control is limited, contaminated meat movement can increase spillover into urban areas (Kracalik et al. 2013, 2015). Limited mechanical transmission may occur within or between herbivorous hosts if tabanid flies do in fact play a role in the transmission cycle (Blackburn et al. 2014a). However, this is likely limited by the seasonality of fly life cycles and conditions that promote pathogen survival. Onward transmission in humans is unlikely. Fade-out results as a consequence of outbreak control interventions [e.g., carcass burning or burial, livestock vaccination campaigns (Kracalik et al. 2014)] or seasonal limits on the pathogen or mechanical vectors, though these conditions are not fully understood.\n",

In contrast, once a pathogen has evolved and adapted to the human host niche (FHC), the pathogen is freed from this spatial restriction. This moves the outbreak from being described principally by ecological variables such as host range or environment (e.g., Ebola, anthrax) to an outbreak described principally by socioculturally shaped transmission dynamics (e.g., HIV). A caveat here is the movement of infected animal products in the form of bush meat, which can expand the spatial restrictions in spillover also driven by sociocultural influences (Alexander et al. 2012a).

The real problem, however, of characterizing transmission spillover boundaries is that sample sizes are rather small and observations are only partial: we may have some observations of successful spillovers (e.g., Ebola outbreaks over the past 40 years), but we have no idea how many infected animal-susceptible human contact events actually occurred. Further, during the early stages of a zoonotic outbreak, we do not have data that provides what proportion of transmission events took place across SB1 and SB3 versus that occurring within the FHC. For example, a hunter may be infected with Ebola virus from eating infected gorilla meat (Fig. 8.4). This infected individual may then go on to infect four other people in his family that care for him. Alternatively, five people in this family may handle and eat the meat of an infected gorilla directly and become infected, with no human-to-human transmission occurring. In both cases, five individuals are infected, but in the first case, two separate parameters must be estimated to predict the pathogen emergence process (transmission rates in both the spillover and the FHC), while in the second case, only the transmission rate in the FHC is needed, given that a spillover event has occurred. It is possible that genetic data may allow us to differentiate between these two cases, though we will need to know something about the rates of Ebola virus strain evolution within animal and humans hosts, respectively. In the second case, however, estimating the probability that isolated spillover events occur over time requires long-term samples of outbreak rates and the assumption of stationary conditions (i.e., the environmental and human population factors involved remain unchanged over time). While the temporal dynamics of these two cases would be different, in a mixed ongoing epidemic, characterization and application of how the two stochastic processes, one at the spillover boundary and one in the FHC, are intertwined are essential to gaining the necessary insight into the outbreak etiology and efficacy of different management actions.\n",

Increasing our research focus on this integration from both the mathematical and conceptual perspective will be important to our ability to model the dynamics of coupled spillover and FHC transmission processes. Emphasis is given to the possibility that some spillovers will stutter to extinction even though we may have R\n0 >> 1 in the human population. Conversely, some spillovers with R\n0 < 1 in the human population will, nevertheless, lead to outbreaks sustained by continuous transmission from animal to human spillover. When the public health focus is on the pathogen, not the strain (as in influenza), we can then consider the case of multiple spillovers of different strains with a distribution of R\n0 in the human population. The public health question is then not so much will an HkN\u2113 (k = 1, ..., 18; \u2113 = 1, ..., 11) variant of influenza spillover and seed an epidemic as it is how often will a reassorted influenza virus spillover and seed an epidemic.

Most spatial patterns in zoonotic disease emergence are currently studied with more correlative methods like ecological niche models, which are tremendously powerful but subject to a number of user-end decisions, only relate patterns of occurrence to environmental variables (transmission risk rather than transmission rates), and suffer from problems relating to lack of consensus among conflicting models. Both modeling frameworks offer the possibility of extending models for predictions under global change; but models that explicitly and mechanistically account for human case burdens arising from spillover (rates, not risks) have a clear advantage when the data exists to parameterize them.",

Using this approach it becomes clearer why influenza is so different from many other zoonotic pathogens because the spillover-FHC concatenation can be bidirectional between humans and animals as well as animals and the environment. While R\n0 is often ubiquitously applied to analysis of all infectious disease, this framework helps us understand why this concept is only part of the story for zoonotic diseases where key stochastic events and interdependent processes influence spillover probability at any or all interfaces. This emphasis on the spillover component of zoonotic disease emergence points to a need for greater computational and mechanistic focus on spillover itself.",
