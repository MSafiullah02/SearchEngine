Urine specimens are also easy to obtain, and the pneumococcal and L. pneumophila antigen assays are generally considered specific. However, these tests provided a diagnosis for only an additional 11% of patients (ie, nonbacteremic cases). A pneumococcal antigen assay was performed for 65 patients with a pneumococcal infection; 51% of the specimens were positive, 65% from bacteremic patients and 40% from nonbacteremic patients, and no more than one-third (13 of 37 patients) tested positive when the sputum samples positive for S. pneumoniae were studied alone. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of the pneumococcal urine antigen assay may be lower than recently reported [32]. Sputum samples for both culture and RQ-PCR were obtained from \u223c70% of all patients. Sputum samples for culture provided a probable etiology for one-fourth of the patients, and sputum samples for RQ-PCR provided a probable etiology for one-third of the patients. Furthermore, for patients with negative test results by culture from blood, sputum, or urine antigen assays, RQ-PCR provided a probable microbial diagnosis in 12% of the cases, confirming that this method is a valuable complement to conventional methods. The ply gene used for the RQ-PCR has recently been identified in Streptococcus mitis as well [33], and thus the specificity of our analysis may be questioned. However, our analysis was quantitative, and any amount of DNA from S. mitis would probably be low. Moreover, our previous data support the good specificity of the negative results from throat samples [20] and the positive findings determined by use of other diagnostic methods [21]. However, in future studies, it will be important to take into account the choice of primers.",

The role that viruses play in causing CAP has not been fully elucidated. In particular, the possibility that the rhinovirus may cause CAP is still considered controversial. However, recent studies have established that rhinovirus replication can occur in the lower airways and that it can infect human respiratory epithelial cell lines in vitro, inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [10, 38]. In some clinical reports, rhinovirus has also been associated with lower respiratory tract disease (including pneumonia) among adults [8, 38].",

In our study, S. pneumoniae was the most common bacterial agent in mixed infections, and a copathogen was found in one-half of the cases, with the majority of pathogens (ie, 83%\u201385%) being viral agents. Thus, viral agents in adults with CAP most often seem to be part of a mixed infection, usually with S. pneumoniae as the copathogen. Also, for patients with severe pneumonia, S. pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen, and the copathogen was frequently found to be a viral agent.",

We have no reason to believe that the group of patients who were not included would have been substantially different from the group of patients that we studied. Also, samples to be obtained at the emergency department were decided by the physician on call, and the patients on the ward were later included in the study by the investigators.
