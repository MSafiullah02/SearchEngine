Even accepting their statement that coughing mostly produces particles greater than 8 \u03bcm, this does not preclude coughed particles of sizes 8\u201310 \u03bcm being able to remain suspended and transmit infection over long distances. They themselves admit that \u201cthere is no exact particle size cut-off at which pathogen transmission changes from exclusively droplet to airborne, or vice versa\u201d. The exact proportion of different sized droplets produced in a cough will differ between individuals in different situations. After the droplets have left the mouth, their size will also be affected by the ambient temperature and relative humidity. For these reasons at least, Brankston and colleagues' generalisation that coughed particles are too large to sustain airborne influenza transmission is unacceptable.",
