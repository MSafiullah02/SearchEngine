In situ hybridization (ISH) was also performed using an oligonucleotide probe targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PEDV (5\u02b9-TGTTGCCATTACCACGACTCCTGC-3\u02b9) obtained from a commercial vendor (Invitrogen Custom Oligos, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with a 5\u02b9 fluorescein label. The probe was reconstituted in a commercial hybridization buffer (BondTM Hybridization Solution, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom) at 5 ng/\u00b5L and the procedure was performed using a commercially available system (Leica Bond-III, Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia). Tissue sections were dewaxed using a commercial dewaxing solution and then treated with a commercially available enzymatic pretreatment (BondTM Enzyme Pretreatment Kit, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom) for 5 min followed by five rinses with a commercial wash solution (BondTM Wash Solution, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom). The diluted probe was applied and allowed to hybridize at 45 \u00b0C for 12 h and then rinsed prior to incubation with an antifluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody for 30 min followed by application of a commercial chromagen system (Bond DAB Refine Kit, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom).

The activity of PEPCK was calculated by subtracting endogenous ATP concentration in homogenates from ATP produced in the presence of oxaloacetate and thus a result of PEPCK. Luminometric determination of ATP was performed in a 96-well plate and fluorescence was measured at 538 nm. Assay mixture after the formation of ATP was diluted 10-fold and 100-fold for liver and jejunum mucosal scrapings, respectively, prior to luminometric determination of ATP. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F1,6BP) activity was measured in duplicate using protocol EC 3.1.3.11 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with modifications. In brief, test buffer contained 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.5), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM NADP, 0.1 mM fructose-1,6-phosphate, 0.83 U phosphoglucose isomerase, and 0.1 U glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Blank buffer contained test buffer without fructose-1,6-phosphate. Glucose-6 phosphatase (G6P) activity was measured in duplicate using protocol EC 3.1.3.9 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with modifications. After addition of 20% TCA, 96 well plates were centrifuged at 750 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 25 \u00b0C. The resulting assay mixture was used for inorganic phosphorous determination using the molybdovanadate method (Ueda and Wada, 1970). These enzymes were chosen to be evaluated as they are enzymes necessary to overcome the irreversible steps of glycolysis and thus key enzymes of gluconeogenesis.",

A reduction in ADFI and ADG was expected based on results from previous work (Kim and Lee, 2014; Schweer et al., 2015b; Curry et al., 2017a) and because appetite and feed intake are generally reduced during an immune response (Johnson, 1998). In swine production, there is wide variation of PEDV infection from subclinical, mild, to severe, and severe with co-infections; however, there are no data on the estimated prevalence of each severity class. Surprisingly, there was no significant overall, or initial (dpi 0 to 5) reductions in ADG or ADFI due to PEDV infection in this study. In fact, ADFI was increased overall due to PEDV challenge compared with Control pigs, and this was most evident at dpi 6 to 20. These data are contrary to what has been previously reported, which PEDV reduced ADG and ADFI from dpi 0 to 7 by 46 to 78 and 23% to 28%, respectively, compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Schweer et al., 2015b; Curry et al., 2017a). One possible explanation could be differences in PEDV infection severity. To evaluate why there was no statistical difference between the two treatments in regard to feed intake and to confirm that the feed intake of Control pigs was as expected, the Swine National Research Council modeling module (NRC, 2012) was utilized to predict feed intake based on dpi 0 BW of each treatment group and dietary energy. Given these parameters, the Control pigs where consuming feed close to their level of predicted during dpi 0 to 5 and PEDV pigs consumed approximately 27% less than their predicted. Although ADG and ADFI were not statistically different between treatments from dpi 0 to 5, these slight reductions in PEDV pigs ADG and ADFI compared with Control pigs resulted in reduced G:F. In this study, there was a 36% reduction in PEDV pigs feed efficiency from dpi 0 to 5 compared with Controls, which is similar to the 28% reduction in feed efficiency reported in 5 wk post-weaned pigs inoculated with PEDV compared with their na\u00efve counterparts from dpi 0 to 7 (Schweer et al., 2015b).",

            "text": "It was hypothesized that feed efficiency was reduced in PEDV pigs due to available nutrients in the lumen being utilized by the intestine during infection and recovery. Upon PEDV infection, enterocytes undergo apoptosis (Jung and Saif, 2015) to rid the host of virus, which can result in reduced absorptive capacity of the small intestine (Curry et al., 2017b). Previous work reported that PEDV detected by IHC is most abundant at dpi 5 and this coincides with increased crypt stem cell proliferation, DNA fragmentation, and active glutamine transport in the jejunum (Curry et al., 2017b). In agreement with this study, it has been well characterized that during peak infection PEDV reduces VH (Stevenson et al., 2013; Madson et al., 2014) and that PEDV increases villus fusion as well as immune cell infiltrates (Schweer et al., 2015a). Crypt stem cell proliferation has been assessed using Ki67 IHC, and PEDV-inoculated pigs have been shown to have increased Ki67-positive cells in small intestinal crypts (Jung et al., 2015; Curry et al., 2017b). Results from this study agree with these two earlier findings. The increased crypt stem cell proliferation was most likely due to rapid re-epithelialization of denuded villi observed in PEDV pigs at dpi 5, which would require increased glutamine transport as the main energy substrate for enterocytes (Burrin and Stoll, 2009), or as a precursor for synthesis of purines, glutathione, or acute phase proteins (Reeds et al., 1994). The supply of energy and nutrients to the intestine is needed to regain absorptive capacity, but also needed by resident immune cells for proliferation and synthesis of effector molecules to rid the host of the pathogen (Humphrey and Klasing, 2004). If energy and nutrients ingested and absorbed by the animal are not enough for immune cell proliferation and activation, then body tissue reserves such as amino acids and fatty acids may be required to provide those substrates. This in turn would likely exacerbate decreases in feed efficiency of livestock during pathogen challenge, which is reported herein.",

To further understand what was contributing to the reduction in G:F, it was tested to see if there was an increase in intestinal epithelial protein synthesis translation efficiency by assessing the protein-to-RNA ratio in PEDV and Control pig jejunal scrapings at dpi 5 and 20. Although there was no difference in this ratio between treatments within dpi, PEDV pigs tended to have greater protein-to-RNA ratio at dpi 20 compared with dpi 5. This may indicate that efficiency and machinery for protein synthesis were increased in PEDV pigs, but that increase may be after dpi 5. Active (phosphorylated) p70S6K protein abundance was increased in jejunum of pigs inoculated with rotavirus compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Rhoads et al., 2007). p70S6K is protein involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is understood to be involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. In malnourished and rotavirus-infected pigs, (phosphorylated) p70S6K protein abundance was also increased in the jejunum, but reduced in the muscle compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Rhoads et al., 2007). Rotavirus, similar to PEDV, infects enterocytes and causes similar clinical signs of diarrhea and dehydration (Hagbom et al., 2011; Holloway and Coulson, 2013). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the intestine has to rebuild an epithelial layer after PEDV infection in order to regain absorptive capacity. The rebuilding intestinal epithelial layer requires energy and nutrients for recovery and those may be coming from muscle, jejunum, liver, or combination of the three.",

The metabolic and nutritional cost of activating the immune system has been difficult to define due to the complex nature of the immune system, differences in pathogenesis (i.e., viral and bacterial) and responses by the host (i.e., enteric, respiratory or systemic). It is generally accepted that during an infection, there is a net loss of nitrogen due to changes in nitrogen retention by the host (Coleman and Dubois, 1915). Acute phase proteins are those proteins released by the liver early in infection that help orchestrate the immune response. Reeds et al. (1994) estimated that 2.33 mg of muscle protein would need to be catabolized in order to supply the AA needed to produce 1 mg of acute phase proteins. In this study, haptoglobin, an acute phase protein, was increased in PEDV pigs at dpi 5 compared with Controls, but there was a no statistical difference at dpi 5 in serum BUN concentration. However, there was a numerical decrease in BUN at dpi 5 in PEDV pigs suggesting a more efficient use of AA.",

Sepsis increased m-calpain protein abundance and release of myofilaments from the myofibrillar fraction of the rat extensor digitorum longus muscle compared with na\u00efve controls (Williams et al., 1999). These authors hypothesized that the disruption of actin and myosin from the Z-disk was calcium-dependent and mediated by calpains, calcium-dependent proteinases. In addition, infusing rats with TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2, two pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulted in increased total muscle protein breakdown and increased myofibrillar protein breakdown (Zamir et al., 1992). Growing pigs that were inoculated PRRSV had no difference in total calpastatin activity, but had increased \u00b5-calpain activity in muscle compared with muscle in healthy counterparts at dpi 21 (Lonergan et al., 2015). In 3-d-old pigs that were infused with 10 \u00b5g/(kg \u00d7 h) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 14 h, then 13.3 \u00b5g/(kg \u00d7 h) of LPS for an additional 6 h, protein synthesis in LD was reduced by approximately 13% as determined by incorporation of l-[4-3H]phenylalanine and fractional rate of protein synthesis calculated (Orellana et al., 2004). Collectively, these studies suggest that during a disease state, there is either a dysregulation of protein synthesis or an increase in muscle proteolysis. However, in this study, there were no differences in unautolyzed \u00b5-calpain (80 kilodalton) and autolysis products (78 and 76 kilodalton) or calpastatin abundance in LD of PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs.",

This suggests that the timing of our sampling may not have been early enough in infection period to capture increases in ERM production or that the 20S proteasome is utilizing cytosolic proteins.

            "text": "Pigs inoculated with PEDV had increased insulin-to-glucose ratios compared with Control pigs regardless of dpi, indicating that PEDV reduced insulin sensitivity. It has been demonstrated in neonatal rats that infusing insulin, while maintaining fasting levels of amino acids and glucose, resulted in increased protein synthesis in muscle, but this response decreased with developmental stage (Davis et al., 2000). In septic rats infused with increasing levels of insulin, protein synthesis increased in extensor digitorum longus muscle compared with healthy counterparts; however, protein breakdown was not inhibited as insulin increased (Hasselgren et al., 1987), indicating that response to insulin in muscle only influenced protein synthesis and not degradation. It has been suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 inhibits the anabolic effect of insulin in muscle (Klasing and Johnstone, 1991). Although insulin sensitivity was reduced, there appeared to be no difference in efficiency of translation in LD of PEDV and Control pigs as measured by protein-to-RNA ratios. However, as discussed previously, Rhoads et al. (2007) demonstrated a (~50%) decrease in the active state of protein translation initiation machinery in the semitendinosus muscle of pigs inoculated with rotavirus at dpi 1 and 3 compared with na\u00efve counterparts.",

            "text": "During an immune response, the utilization of dietary AA shifts from lean growth to production of glucose for energy (Klasing and Johnstone, 1991) and this is speculated to be contributing to the reductions in feed efficiency in PEDV challenged pigs. As gluconeogenesis is important for maintenance of blood glucose when hepatic glycogen stores begin to deplete (Watford, 2005), activities of enzymes that bypass the irreversible steps of glycolysis for gluconeogenesis were determined in liver and jejunum during PEDV infection. It was hypothesized that gluconeogenesis would provide glucose for ATP needed to combat infection and regeneration of the intestine and keto acids for metabolism. The liver is the main generator of endogenous glucose production (Mittelman and Bergman, 1998); however, the intestine is also gluconeogenic and may contribute to glucose production during various disease states. Glutamine is the main precursor for glucose production from the small intestine, which can provide approximately 20% of systemic endogenous glucose production (Croset et al., 2001). Schweer et al. (2015a) and Curry et al. (2017b) demonstrated that during PEDV infection, the jejunum increases active transport of glutamine. In addition, glutamine has been shown to increase ornithine decarboxylase activity, an important enzyme for pyrimidine synthesis, and incorporation of [3H]thymidine, an indicator of increased protein synthesis (Kandil et al., 1995). We speculate that the increased feed intake observed in PEDV pigs was sufficient in supplying energy and nutrients to the intestinal epithelium for restitution, thus explaining why we did not observe any difference between treatments within dpi in jejunum or liver gluconeogenic enzyme activities.",

Thus, we propose that luminal nutrients are being diverged from lean growth to intestinal epithelium recovery during PEDV infection, resulting in altered feed efficiency.",
