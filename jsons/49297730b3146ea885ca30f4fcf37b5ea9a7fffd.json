Out of all the possible poses suggested by AutoDock Vina, the pose showing maximum hydrogen bonds and minimum binding free energy change (kcal/mol), as represented in the ViewDock window, were chosen. They were further analysed in Biovia Discovery Studio (DS) visualizer for the formation of hydrogen bonds, in addition to other supporting hydrophobic interactions, by the functional groups of ligands with the amino acids of 3CL pro . The metabolite (ligand) making maximum number of Hbonds, showing capability to form covalent interaction with 3CL pro and showed highest binding affinity was chosen for further study using molecular dynamics simulation. The structure analysis of SARS-CoV2 3CL pro shows that, the substrate binding site is located in the Cys-His catalytic dyad. Domain I extend from residues 8 to 101 and Domain II ranges from residues 102 to 184 comprise of antiparallel \u03b2-barrel structure. Domain residues is formed from residue 201 to 303 and possess five \u03b1-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular cluster, which is connected to domain II means of a long loop region extending from residue 185 to 200. For COVID-19, the substrate binding site is located in the cleft between Domain I and II. Binding of N3 with 3CL pro shows that it binds in the substrate binding pocket in (Figure 1 ). N3 is relatively a large molecule where its backbone forms an antiparallel sheet with residues 164 to168 (His164, Glu166, Met165, Leu167, Pro168) of 3CL pro while also interacting with residues 189 to191 (Gln189, Thr190, Ala191) of the loop that links Domain II and III. The group of scientists who co-crystalized this protein with N3 also suggest strong covalent bond formed by Cys145 of 3CL pro with N3 of the 1.8 \u00c5 length, in turn, making the interaction with of this inhibitor bind irreversibly with the protein. Briefly, the inhibitor N3 makes six hydrogen bonds (with Gly143, Phe140, His163, His164, Glu166 and Thr190), one amide pi-stacked interaction (with Leu141), five pi-alkyl interactions (with His41, Met49, Leu167, Pro168 and Ala191) two carbon hydrogen bonds (Met165 and His172) and one van der Walls interactions (with Asn142) with 3CL pro .",

On performing the docking of all the metabolites one by one with 3CL pro , it was observed that, only five molecules were able to make three hydrogen bonds or more with 3CL pro at the binding cleft of N3. These were Asperic acid, Aspernigrin A, Aurosperone B, Carbomymethyl-3-hexylmaleic acid and the best one, flaviolin. Flaviolin showed to make eight hydrogen bonds in total (with Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, Glu166 and Gln189) and made one carbon hydrogen bond (with Asn142) and the docking energy as predicted by AutoDock Vina was -7.3 kcal/mol for the best pose ( Figure 2 ). As shown previously, N3 showed interaction with residues 164 to168 (His164, Glu166, Met165, Leu167, Pro168) of 3CL pro along with interacting with residues 189 to191 (Gln189, Thr190, Ala191) of the loop that links Domain II and III, flaviolin also showed similar interaction with 3CL pro . All these properties make flaviolin as the best choice as the most suitable inhibitor for 3CL pro . When the docked best pose of flaviolin was made to superimpose with that of N3 on 3CLpro, it was observed that it was able to bind exactly at the same N3 binding cleft (Figure 1) . Moreover, the docking analysis suggested that flaviolin interacted with almost all similar amino acids akin to N3-3CL pro binding.",

Once the NVT run was completed the system was proceeded with NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) simulation and MD run was performed for 1000 ps. Trajectories were analysed for rootmean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg) and the number of H-bonds formed between the ligand and proteins using 'gmx rms','gmx rmsf', 'gmx gyrate' and 'gmx hbond' of GROMACS utilities (Bekker et al., 1993; Pronk et al., 2013) .

The RMSD values for the backbone of proteins in presence of both the ligands, 3CL pro was found to be more stable in presence of flaviolin as compared to N3. Though, on stabilization of the system after 500 ps of MD run, the RMSD values were almost equal (Figure 4a). Radius of gyration (Rg) was determined to understand the level of compaction in the structure of 3CL pro in the presence of N3 and Flaviolin. The Rg is defined as the mass weighted root mean square distance of a collection of atoms from their common center of mass. Hence this analysis gives us the overall dimensions of the protein. The calculated Rg values over the simulation time scale for (i) N3-3CL pro and (ii) Flaviolin-3CL pro are shown in Figure 4b. The Rg value of N3-3CL pro and Flaviolin-3CL pro varies between 2.192 nm and 2.190 nm. From the Rg plot, it shows that Flaviolin-3CL pro has marginally lower Rg values, however the difference cannot be considered significant. This suggest the protein behave identical in presence of N3 and Flaviolin. The RMSF with respect to the average MD simulation conformation reflects as a mean portraying flexibility differences among residues. The RMSF of the backbone atoms of each residue in the (i) N3-3CL pro and (ii) Flaviolin-3CL pro individually is calculated to reveal the flexibility of the backbone structure in presence of both ligands. This shows how the protein behaves in presence of different ligands. The high RMSF value indicates more flexibility whereas the low RMSF value indicates limited movements during simulation in relation to its average position. The RMSF of the protein backbone 3CL pro in presence of both the ligands N3 and Flaviolin were almost identical suggesting similar affinity of binding with the protein. If the binding is poor than the protein is freer to hive higher RMSF values, which is not the case here (Figure 5c, d). While the RMSF of the ligands N3",
