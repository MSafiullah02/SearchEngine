            "text": "To the Editor-On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to constitute a pandemic of COVID-19 infectious disease. 1 On February 20, 2020, the first national cluster in Italy was identified in the Lombardy region after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in a 38-year-old man with a severe pneumonia and no relevant exposure history. 2 To date, 74,386 SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in Italy, with 32,346 cases in Lombardy alone, by far the most affected region. 3 Given the extent of the phenomenon, we must urgently consider how the rapid spread of the infection can overload the National Health Service (SSN) and affect the mortality rate. The SSN is regarded as a high-level healthcare service, and it is regionally based. 4 Specifically, Lombardy's healthcare service is considered a benchmark in terms of quality and efficiency. 5 In Lombardy, region of~10 million people, the pre-crisis total intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity was of~720 beds, with a mean occupancy rate in the winter months of 85%-90%. 2 To deal with SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the number of ICU beds has significantly increased, and several departments have been reorganized and dedicated exclusively to COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, hospitals in Lombardy are dramatically overcrowded with lack of medications, mechanical ventilators, oxygen, and personal protective equipment (PPE). 6 Clearly, the increased number of cases is posing a serious threat to the entire SSN. 7 We believe that the following numbers regarding the Lombardy region help to fully measure and elucidate the medical and social impact of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.",
