Their odd appearances, nocturnal life styles, and the fact they harbor a variety of zoonotic diseases, particularly rabies, have lead them to be feared rather than respected. However, beneath the surface of the legend, they are members of a diverse group of animals, many of which are essential for the maintenance of ecosystems. In fact, because of disease and habitat destruction, humans are a greater threat to bats than they are to humans.68 Recent events such as the emergence of white nose syndrome (WNS) and the continued recognition of metabolic diseases in captive bats have shown that much more research is needed into the medical and environmental needs of these animals. Improving veterinary care, conservation efforts, and captive husbandry relies on a deeper understanding of bat biology and how these unique animals fit into larger ecosystems.",

Most species of bat are found in tropical or subtropical regions, where they may remain year round. Those inhabiting less temperate areas must adapt to survive inhospitable climates. Some species migrate, whereas others hibernate. Both survival strategies require specializations. Migratory bats have narrow, more pointed wings that provide more efficient wing strokes for sustained flight. Both hibernating and migratory bats have developed life histories, which allow them to increase fat store prior to hibernation, and thus rely on abundant steady food supplies during certain times of the year.38 Hibernating bats undergo profound physiologic alterations during hibernation, which result in decreased metabolism, body temperature, and modulation of the immune system. Having an abundant food supply available after hibernation is essential for the survival of these bats.38\n",

The highly specialized vampire bats, including the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata), white-winged vampire bat (Diamus youngi), and the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), are hematophagous and are the only known mammals that are obligate parasites.38 Fruit-eating bats may limit their diets to a small number of fruits, whereas others are more generalized feeders.38 When designing plans for conservation or for sustaining bats in captivity, it is essential that the normal wild feeding habits of each species be understood so as to provide the proper diet and feeding opportunities.",

            "text": "Several studies have examined captive diets and have focused on determining if what the bats consume provides the recommended amount of nutrients. Importantly, predicted dietary values and actual dietary values may differ. Specifically, vitamins A and E and cascium (Ca) concentrations have been found to be lower in the actual diet than would be predicted on the basis of the ingredients. Similarly, trace mineral concentrations of phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and zinc (Zn) tend to be higher in left-over food than in the original diet and tend to be high in feces. This discrepancy suggests some dietary selection by the animals or that the animals are obtaining these elements from alternative sources such as from the galvanized materials in enclosures.23 Maintaining an overall healthy balance of the levels of vitamins in the diet is important, as complex interaction between compounds may affect the absorption and excretion of other nutrients. Deficiencies or excesses have been associated with the development of disease. Vitamin E deficiency has been associated with cardiomyopathy and excess flouride with a syndrome of hyperostosis.23, 25\n",

            "text": "As with many frugivores, excess iron in the diet of fruit-eating bats may result in hepatic disease. When tissues levels of iron become high enough, hepatocytes are damaged, leading to hepatic necrosis and scarring of the liver in more chronic situations.23 This propensity to develop both hepatic hemosiderosis and hemochromatosis likely relates to the relative paucity of available iron in the diets of free-ranging animals. Frugivorous bats may particularly absorb iron efficiently, which leads to excessive absorption when iron levels are high. The regulation of iron levels is complex and is mediated not only by dietary levels but by interactions with other nutrients. High concentrations of vitamin C enhance the absorption of iron and may potentiate free radical damage to tissues.25 Furthermore, other dietary constituents found in the wild and not in captivity may serve to mediate iron availability. Tannins, calcium phosphate, egg yolk, and bran may inhibit iron absorption. Ferrous iron itself is transported across enterocyte membranes to the cytoplasm by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). DMT1 may also transport other metal ions such as cobalt, lead, zinc, cadmium, and copper. The presence of these ions in some cases may upregulate DMT1 and thus secondarily lead to increased iron transport. Alternatively, the presence of these metals may competitively inhibit ferrous ion transport.23, 25, 40\n",

Although histopathology is the gold standard for the diagnosis of hemochromatosis, less invasive methods such as use of blood parameters may also be used to monitor the development of iron storage disease. Surprisingly, despite the hepatic damage caused by iron accumulation, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are not useful in detecting iron-induced liver damage. Farina (2005) studied the correlation of various blood parameters to histologic grade of iron deposition and damage in two species of fruit bat, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), and the island flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus).25 Serum iron, transferrin saturation, and plasma ferritin showed positive correlation with morphologic hepatic iron concentration.25 If the product of the serum iron level and the transferrin saturation exceeded 51, the bats had a high probability of iron overload. Products greater than 90 indicated a high probability of hemochromatosis. It has yet to be fully determined if these techniques may be used to monitor efficacy of treatment for iron overload.25\n",

Thus, areas rough enough for them to grasp must be provided, but care must be taken that the caging material is not so rough that it causes injury to the animals. In some research settings, bats are provided with strips of cloth, and cloth bags are hung along the edges of the habitat to provide rest areas.

Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)\u2013positive cells, presumed to be Langerhans cells, are frequently present in the lesions, and epithelial cell proliferation occurs into the tick mouthparts.

This nematode is a frequent intestinal parasite of flying foxes (genus Pteropus) inhabiting Oceania and southeastern Asia.54 Nematodes mature in the intestines of suckling bats, but the animals clear the infection by the time of weaning. Adult bats ingest the eggs and third-stage larvae hatch and migrate to the liver and, in females, to the mammary gland where they are passed to the neonates. Infection is common with approximately 50% of juvenile gray-headed flying foxes (P. poliocephalus) in eastern Australia having patent infections. Infected bats do not usually appear ill. Both the reported fatal cases occurred in spectacled flying foxes (P. conspicillatus) that had recently been brought into captivity.54 Both died acutely between 3 and 8 days of capture. In the first, an adult male parasite was found in the gallbladder; in the second, a parasite was found extending from the laryngopharynx into the esophagus.54\n",

Y. pseudotuberculosis was cultured from 7 of these animals. Of these bats, 2 had acute disease, with sepsis, multi-organ failure, rapid progression, and death. The other 8 exhibited a more chronic disease course, with necrotizing abscesses in multiple organs, especially the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Subsequently, 12 animals were euthanized to survey the colony. At postmortem, 41.7% of the animals had abscesses in multiple organs. These data, indicating widespread asymptomatic disease, led to the depopulation of the colony.16 Necropsies revealed that 70% of the bats had gross lesions of lymphadenopathy, hepatic abscesses, and splenomegaly consistent with Y. pseudotuberculosis. Histologic lesions ranged from mild, suggestive of sepsis, to severe necrotizing inflammation associated with gram-negative bacteria. The cause of this outbreak was not clear; however, necropsies did reveal some previously undetected diseases in the colony, including an unspecified species of Demodex Mycobacterium avium and Microsporidium hellum.40 The disease outbreak began when the population density approached 0.1 bats per cubic foot, and thus population density may have been a factor in the outbreak.16\n",

In these animals, the G. destructans infection was cleared.46 Although captive treatment of endangered bats may be possible, removal of large numbers of bats from the environment is not feasible.

One bat had a proliferative glomerulonephritis and tubular proteinosis, as well hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Another had suppurative bronchopneumonia.

This ability for them to act as asymptomatic carriers is one of the most important aspects of bat-associated zoonoses.14 How bats remain healthy while harboring pathogens that would kill other mammals is unknown. Some evidence suggests that hibernation may alter the immune system of bats.13 Other evidence suggests that bats co-evolved with these pathogens. Lyssaviruses and rabies viruses seem to have evolved with bats, and Hendra and Nipah viruses are old viruses that may have circulated in flying fox populations throughout evolution.26 Even if this phenomenon is the result of highly evolved host\u2013pathogen interactions, it is unclear what causes these diseases to emerge and enter human populations. Given the precarious conservation situation of many bat species, further study is needed to determine how pathogens interact with the Chiropteran immune system and what environmental pressure may lead to the spillage of disease from bats to other animals.",

Although much is known about what pathogens are harbored by bats, little is known about the diseases that they succumb to or why they seem to be resistant to numerous pathogens. A more nuanced appreciation of these animals has led to a better understanding of captive bat management, dietary requirements, and habitat needs, but much needs to be learned.
