            "text": "Chemically synthesized short interfering RNA (siRNA) has ushered a new era in the application of RNA interference (RNAi) against viral genes. We have paid particular attention to respiratory viruses that wreak heavy morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinically signifi cant ones include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfl uenza virus (PIV) (two Paramyxoviruses), and infl uenza virus (an Orthomyxovirus). As the infection by these viruses is clinically restricted to the respiratory tissues, mainly the lungs, the logical route for the application of the siRNA was also the same, i.e., via the nasal route. Following the initial success of single intranasal siRNA against RSV, we now offer two new strategies: (1) second-generation siRNAs, used against the paramyxoviral RNA polymerase large subunit (L), (2) siRNA cocktail with a novel transfection reagent, used against infl uenza virus. Based on these results, we propose the following consensus for designing intranasal antiviral siRNAs: (a) modifi ed 19-27 nt-long double-stranded siRNAs are functional in the lung, (b) excessive 2\u2032-OMe and 2\u2032-F modifi cations in either or both strands of these siRNAs reduce effi cacy, (c) limited modifi cations in the sense strand are benefi cial, although their precise effi cacy may be position-dependent, (d) cocktail of multiple siRNAs can be highly effective against multiple viral strains and subtypes.",

            "text": "Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) trigger posttranscriptional gene silencing in a variety of metazoan cells and tissues [ 1 ] . Successful use of synthetic double-stranded siRNA in 2001 [ 1 , 2 ] targeting cellular and viral genes in cell culture, opened the door to siRNA as prospective antivirals and drugs for gene therapy. The \"fi rstgeneration\" siRNAs were designed to mimic the products of the Dicer endonuclease cleavage; they were 19 nt-long duplexes with 3\u2032-terminal 2 nt overhangs and contained natural, unmodifi ed ribose and bases. As reported by us [ 3 , 4 ] and several other laboratories [ 5 -7 ] , these siRNAs proved effective both in cell culture and in animals. effective in treating these infections, are both relatively nonspecifi c and toxic [ 14 ] . Regarding the molecular features, RSV and PIV are nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, belonging to different genera of the Paramyxoviridae family [ 6 ] . In contrast, fl u is an Orthomyxovirus and contains segmented negative-strand RNA genome [ 9 , 10 ] . Coronoviruses such as SARS-CoV contain positive-strand RNA genomes [ 11 ] . A commonality among these RNA viruses is that they encode genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to transcribe and replicate their own genomes, because the host animal cells are devoid of such activity. Many of the potent antiviral siRNAs have, therefore, targeted viral genes coding for RdRP subunits or proteins that are related to RdRP function [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 -11 ] . These early studies targeted: P (Phosphoprotein), L (Large) ( see Table 1 ), and N (Nucleocapsid) genes of RSV; P and L genes of PIV; PA and NP genes of Flu; and the replicase gene of SARS-CoV. In all cases, siRNAs were designed against essential viral gene(s), optimized in cell culture and then used intranasally in the appropriate animal model. Antiviral activity was shown against RSV and parainfl uenza virus (PIV) using the BALB/c mouse model as well [ 4 ] . In those studies, optimal results were obtained with siRNAs delivered in complex with either Subheading 2 ) , although uncomplexed intranasal siRNA also showed some effi cacy [ 4 ] . Intranasal siRNA, complexed with oligofectamine or polyethyleneimine (PEI), was also protective against highly pathogenic infl uenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes in mice [ 9 , 10 ] . Notwithstanding their success, the activity of these siRNAs was transient, lasting only a few days. Therefore, enhancement of the intracellular and extracellular stability of synthetic siRNAs while increasing (or without compromising) their RNAi activity is a continuing goal for therapeutic translation of RNAi. A variety of chemical modifi cations, including terminal and internal ones, have been added to the fi rst-generation siRNA sequences to improve stability and delivery, leading to what we call \"second-generation\" siRNAs. Advantage has been taken of the free 2\u2032-OH group of the ribose moiety of RNA (in contrast to DNA that lacks this OH group), to which various substituents were added. We have pursued two promising ones, namely 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-O-Me) and 2\u2032-fl uoride (2\u2032-F). The latter modification is placed on pyrimidine nucleosides (C, U), leading to 2\u2032-FC and 2\u2032-FU residues. In a number of previous studies [ 16 -19 ] , these substitutions were introduced to various extents in the antisense strand (\"guide\" strand) or both strands of the siRNA and were shown to enhance stability and potency, although intranasal application was not tested. Additionally, they tend to reduce siRNA-driven innate immune response [ 20 , 21 ] . In systematic studies in cell culture, the biochemical and functional activity of the siRNA was vindicated but found to be affected by the position of the modifi cations in the sequence [ 16 -19 ] . Generally speaking, those with the modifi ed ribonucleotides at the 5\u2032-end of the antisense strand were less active relative to the 3\u2032-modifi ed ones. Internally, while 2\u2032-F was generally well-tolerated on the antisense strand, 2\u2032-O-Me showed signifi cant shift in activity depending on the position. In contrast, incorporation of 2\u2032-O-Me in the sense strand of siRNA did not show a strong positional preference. In a comprehensive study, however, internal 2\u2032-O-Me modifi cations in either or both strands actually made the siRNA less active [ 22 ] . In an animal experiment [ 23 ] , all the 2\u2032-OH residues in siRNAs against hepatitis B virus were substituted with 2\u2032-F and 2\u2032-O-Me. When administered intravenously (i.v.) as lipid complexes, the 2\u2032-O-Me, 2\u2032-F siRNAs showed improved effi cacy and longer halflife in plasma and liver. When these siRNAs were additionally Cy3labeled, it revealed their accumulation in the liver and spleen, but not in the lung, explaining the success of the i.v. administration against hepatitis while suggesting that it is an ineffective route against lung infections.",

Place the anesthetized mouse on a lab towel facing up; with its head immobilized, insert microcapillary tip containing siRNA/ transfection reagent complexes ( see Note 4 ) into the nostril. Use a range of 2-20 nmol siRNA per mouse (e.g., 2, 6, 10 nmol). Instill solution slowly over a 2-3 min period, allowing the animal to breathe the liquid in ( see Note 5 ).5.Return the mouse to the cage and monitor for at least 45 min to avoid depression of cardiac and/or respiratory functions.6. Test for the desired RNAi effect at appropriate intervals. For antiviral studies, instill virus through the nostril as well. For human RSV, which does not infect mice well, use 10 7 -10 8 virus particles per animal, and measure standard lung titer assay and/or clinical symptoms (such as body weight, respiration rate, etc.) ( see Note 6 ).",
