These risk groups include immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL patients experience immune suppression both from their disease and secondary to chemotherapy, which they receive for up to 3.5 years [2, 3] . Children with cancer also have a higher frequency of influenza infections and longer duration of symptoms compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, they are more likely to be hospitalized due to influenza illness.",

A phase III study found a statistically significant higher antibody response to both influenza A antigens in elderly patients who received the HD vaccine compared to those who received the SD Background. Although children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mount immune responses after vaccination with the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), these responses are lower compared to controls. Recently, a high dose (HD) TIV was found to increase the level of antibody response in elderly patients compared to the standard dose (SD) TIV. We hypothesized that the HD TIV would be well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the SD TIV in pediatric subjects with ALL. Procedure. This was a randomized, double-blind, phase I safety trial comparing the HD to the SD TIV in children with ALL. Our secondary objective was immunogenicity. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either the HD (60 mg) or the SD (15 mg) TIV. Local and systemic reactions were solicited, hemagglutinin inhibition titers to influenza virus antigens were measured, and monitoring labs were collected prior to and/or after each vaccination. Results. Fifty subjects were enrolled (34 HD, 16 SD). Mean age was 8.5 years; 63% were male, and 80% were in maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences reported in local or systemic symptoms. No severe adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No significant differences between the HD and SD TIV groups were noted for immune responses. Conclusions. No differences were noted between the HD and SD TIV groups for solicited systemic and local reactions. Since this study was not powered for immunogenicity, a phase II trial is needed to determine the immunogenicity of HD versus SD TIV in the pediatric ALL population.

These discrepancies may be explained by the use of different influenza vaccines: monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent; whole cell versus split cell; and varying doses (from 50 to 400 chicken cell-agglutinating); different immunization schedules; different chemotherapeutic regimens; and most importantly inadequate samples sizes in those that did not find a statistically significant difference between children with and without cancer [23] . The majority of these earlier studies; however, reported that lower antibody titers were achieved in individuals with cancer, including children with ALL, when compared to healthy controls [23] . In addition, individuals receiving chemotherapy had significantly lower titers compared to those off chemotherapy [23] . Lower immune responses in children with ALL receiving chemotherapy compared to healthy controls and children with ALL off-chemotherapy were also reported in more current studies with TIV [14, 15, 19] . Two studies compared TIV to a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children with cancer; the first study proved it was safe to administer LAIV in these children [22] . However, the second study revealed that the LAIV produced lower HAI titers compared to the TIV [21] , suggesting that the LAIV was not as effective in this population compared to the TIV. Thus, these studies indicated that the optimal influenza vaccine does not exist at this time, and therefore this population could benefit from further research into improved influenza vaccines.",

This was a phase I study with a small number of patients enrolled and although we did not see any increased local or systemic reactions associated with the HD TIV, further studies with a larger population are needed. Recruitment occurred over two influenza seasons which is not ideal, but the vaccine formulations remained identical. Even though we limited our patients to children with ALL in remission and at least 4 weeks into the initiation of chemotherapy, this was still a heterogeneous population, which could have affected our immunogenicity results. Finally, we changed our inclusion criteria in study year 2, which allowed patients to enroll after 4 weeks into chemotherapy rather than once in the maintenance phase. Patients enrolled prior to the maintenance phase of chemotherapy are receiving more intense therapy and this might have affected their immune response to the vaccine in study year 2. Since more than 80% of patients were in maintenance during the study, the population was quite similar.",

More importantly, since influenza viruses continue to cause high morbidity and mortality, and children with ALL do not respond adequately to SD TIV, finding a better influenza vaccine for this population could be of great benefit.",
