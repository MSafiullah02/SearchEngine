            "text": "Group A rotaviruses are a major cause of neonatal diarrhea in humans and animals. Rotaviruses are non-enveloped and possess a triple-layered capsid, enclosing 11 fragments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The outer viral capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, elicit neutralizing antibody responses and form the basis of the current dual classification system by G and P types. The VP7 expresses the major neutralizing antigen and is distinguishable by means of both serological and genomic techniques in 14 G types, with good correlation between the serological and genomic classifications. Also, since the VP4 expresses the minor neutralizing antigen, the serological classification of the P types is much more difficult than the genomic classification. To date, 13 P serotypes (including subtypes) and 20 P genotypes have been defined, but no precise correlation has been made between the serological and the genomic classifications. Thus a different designation has been adopted for the P serotype (open numbers) and the P genotype (numbers in square brackets) (Estes and Cohen, 1989, Estes, 1996). As regards canine rotavirus, all the strains isolated display the G3 and P5A[3] specificities (Hoshino et al., 1984, Nakagomi et al., 1989, Gouvea et al., 1994a, Gouvea et al., 1994b, Taniguchi et al., 1994).",

The differences observed demonstrate that variability exist among the canine rotaviruses. Similarly, nucleotide and amino acidic variation in the VP7 of human G3 rotaviruses has been recently described and serotype 3 viruses are currently considered to be intraserotypically more heterologous than serotype 1, 2 and 4 viruses (Wen et al., 1997, Suzuki et al., 1998). Furthermore, by cross-neutralization tests, monoclonal antibody analysis and RNA hybridization, two G3 subtypes of equine rotavirus have been established (Browning et al., 1992). Therefore, we hypothesize that the differences observed in strain RV52/96 could account for the existence of a G3-subtype of canine rotavirus. However, the analysis of additional canine isolates and serological evaluations are required to confirm this hypothesis.",

The porcine, murine, lapine, equine and canine strains, moreover, are clearly distinguishable from each other. In agreement with previous observations (Ciarlet et al., 1995), the porcine isolates seem to be more related to human than to animal rotaviruses. The human strain HCR3 shows a high homology with the canine strains, whereas the feline strain CAT2 is grouped into the human cluster. This is not surprising since strain HCR3A has been shown to be genetically highly related to the canine strains (Gouvea et al., 1990, Li et al., 1993, Li et al., 1994, Taniguchi et al., 1994, Santos et al., 1998). On the other hand, strain CAT2 shares the VP4 specificity, P3A[9], with human strains such as Au1 and K8 (Gouvea et al., 1994a, Taniguchi et al., 1994). As regard strain RV52/96, the homology with strain RRV is consistent with previous findings (Taniguchi et al., 1994) describing the close genetic relationship between the VP4 of canine rotaviruses and RRV. These results point out the usefulness of phylogenetic analysis for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the complex ecology of rotaviruses.",
