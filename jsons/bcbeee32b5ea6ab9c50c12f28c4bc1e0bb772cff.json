Here, we discuss issues related to the establishment of this technology and areas that are highly promising for its application. We also provide an example to illustrate that the carbohydrate microarray is a discovery tool; it is particularly useful for identifying immunological sugar moieties, including differentially expressed complex carbohydrates of cancer cells and stem cells as well as sugar signatures of previously unrecognized microbial pathogens.",

As a result, carbohydrate moieties are suitable for storing biological signals in the forms that are identifiable by other biological systems. In this chapter, we discuss 1) our theoretical consideration for developing high-throughput carbohydrate microarrays, 2) a unique approach we took to establish carbohydrate microarrays, 3) a practical carbohydrate microarray platform that is currently in use by our laboratory, and 4) an example that illustrates a highly promising area for carbohydrate microarray technology to explore.",

This discovery raised an important question about the roles of protein processing and structural modification in modulating the biological activities of proteins and cellular functions. In higher eukaryotic species, most secretory and membrane-bound proteins are decorated with sugar moieties, which is achieved by a critically important posttranslational protein modification, called glycosylation. In many physiological and pathophysiological conditions, expression of cellular glycans, in the form of either glycoproteins or glycolipids, is differentially regulated. There are documented examples that show that cell display of precise complex carbohydrates is characteristically associated with the stages or steps of embryonic development, cell differentiation, and transformation of normal cell to abnormally differentiated tumor or cancer cells (7-10). Sugar moieties are also abundantly expressed on the outer surfaces of the mass majority of viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens. Many sugar structures are pathogen specific, which makes them important molecular targets for pathogen recognition, diagnosis of infectious diseases, and vaccine development (4, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Thus, the fundamental principles that are at the basis of establishment of a carbohydrate-based assay differ from the basic principles of the nucleic acid-based assays, such as the cDNA microarray and oligonucleotide biochips. For the nucleic acid-based biochips, the detection specificity is determined by the A::T and C::G base pairing, and there is no need to preserve the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the nucleic acid molecules. By contrast, carbohydrate microarrays require preservation of the 3D conformations and topological configurations of sugar moieties on a chip to permit a targeted molecular recognition by the corresponding cellular receptors to take place (4,5).",

By contrast, when the cavitytype mAb 16.4.12E was applied, it bound to the immobilized dextran preparations with branches (N279 and B1299S) but not to those with only internal linear chain structure (LD7). These patterns of antigen-antibody reactivities are typically identical to those recognized by an ELISA binding assay for either the groove type or cavity type of antidextran mAbs. Therefore, the immunological properties of dextran molecules are well preserved when immobilized on a nitrocellulose-coated glass slide. Their nonreducing end structure, recognized by the cavity-type anti-(1,6)dextrans as well as the internal linear chain epitopes bound by the groove-type anti-(1,6)dextrans are displayed on the surface after immobilization and are accessible to antibodies in an aqueous solution. This approach was then extended to test a large panel of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules to assess their immobilization on chip and to evaluate expression of antigenic structures for antibody detection.

In combination with the use of semisynthetic glycoconjugates, which display unique oligosaccharide chains, a biochip-based characterization of the epitope-binding specificity of a single antibody or lectin and determination of the dominant antigenic responses elicited by a natural infection or a vaccination would be practically achievable.

For example, a sugar chip can be applied in screening for the carbohydrate-based cellular receptors of a microorganism. Experimentally, a candidate protein or the whole cell of a microbe can be placed on a sugar chip to probe the carbohydrate structures that a microbial pathogen may bind and selectively colonize in certain type of host cells or tissue environments. Such investigation is noteworthy, because it may lead to a better understanding of the host-microbe biological relationship as well as the pathogenesis mechanism of human pathogens. A reverse type of application is to print a large panel of structurally uncharacterized polysaccharides or glycoconjugates, such as those isolated from mixtures of natural herbs of traditional eastern medicines, to react with antibodies or lectins of known carbohydrate-binding specificities. In this way, the sugar chain epitope profile of these printed preparations can be rapidly recognized, providing important clues for drug discovery. In addition, such sugar chain epitope mapping strategy is technically straightforward and is suitable to serve as a scanning method to verify and control the quality of a complex formula of herbal medicine or nutrition additives, which contain significant quantities of glycan components or lectins with carbohydrate-binding reactivities.",

We proposed to take advantage of the highly evolved immune systems of mammals to recognize the immunogenic sugar moieties of microbes. Specifically, we use carbohydrate microarrays to capture specific antibodies elicited by a microorganism (see Fig. 3 for a schematic illustration of this approach). To critically evaluate this strategy, we have chosen a previous unrecognized viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (32-34), as a model for our investigation. This task was difficult and challenging, because information regarding the sugar moieties of this virus was entirely unavailable. This information is, however, very important for our consideration of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV as well as investigation of pathogenic mechanisms of SARS. Therefore, we constructed glycan arrays to display carbohydrate antigens of defined structures and subsequently applied these tools to detect carbohydrate-specific antibody \"fingerprints\" that were elicited by a SARS vaccine. Our rational was that if SARS-CoV expressed antigenic carbohydrate structures, then immunizing animals by using the whole virus-based vaccines would have the possibility to elicit antibodies specific for these structures. In addition, if SARS-CoV displayed a carbohydrate structure that mimics host cellular glycans, then vaccinated animals may develop antibodies with autoimmune reactivity to their corresponding cellular glycans.",

We found that lectin PHA-L (for Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is specific for a defined complex carbohydrate of ASOR (Fig. 3C,D) . Using this reagent as a probe, we confirmed that only the SARS-CoV-infected cells express a PHA-L-reactive antigenic structure (see ref. 3 for the details).

ASOR is an abundant human serum glycoprotein and the ASOR-type complex carbohydrates are also expressed by other host glycoproteins (35,36) . Thus, the human immune system is generally nonresponsive to these selfcarbohydrate structures. However, when similar sugar moieties were expressed by a viral glycoprotein, their cluster configuration could differ significantly from those displayed by a cellular glycan, and in this manner, generate a novel nonself antigenic structure. A documented example of such antigenic structure is a broad-range HIV-1 neutralization epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody 2G12. This antibody is specific for a unique cluster of sugar chains displayed by the gp120 glycoprotein of HIV-1 (37). It is, hence, important to examine whether naturally occurring SARS-CoV expresses the ASOR-type autoimmune reactive sugar moieties. During a SARS epidemic spread, the viruses replicate in human cells. Their sugar chain expression may differ from the monkey cell-produced viral particles. Scanning of the serum antibodies of SARS patients by using glycan arrays or other specific immunological tools may endow with information to shed light on this question.",

Our laboratory has established a simple, precise, and highly efficient experimental approach for the construction of carbohydrate microarrays (1-3) . This approach makes use of existing cDNA microarray system, including spotter and scanner, for carbohydrate array production. A key technical element of this array platform is the introduction of nitrocellulose-coated microglass slides to immobilize unmodified carbohydrate antigens on the chip surface noncovalently. This technology has achieved the sensitivity to recognize the profiles of human anti-carbohydrate antibodies with as little as a few microliters of serum specimen and reached the chip capacity to include the antigenic preparations of most common pathogens (~20,000 microspots per biochip). We described also an eight-chamber subarray system to produce carbohydrate microarrays of relative smaller scale, which is more frequently applied in our laboratory's routine research activities. Of late, we applied this system to assemble glycan arrays to probe the immunogenic sugar moieties of a recently discovered viral pathogen, SARS-CoV. This research approach is probably applicable for the identification of immunological targets of other microorganisms and for the exploration of complex carbohydrates that are differentially expressed by host cells, including stem cells at various stages of differentiation and human cancers.",
