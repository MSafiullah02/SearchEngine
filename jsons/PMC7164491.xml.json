However, inherent to ECMO are several risks\u2014including hemorrhage, thrombosis, and cannula malfunction\u2014which negate its potential benefits for several patient populations, including those at risk for bleeding or who have sustained traumatic brain injury. In addition, ECMO requires bulky equipment, extensive technical training, and is expensive\u2014all of which limit its use outside of the intensive care unit setting. These limitations and risks eliminate ECMO as a viable treatment alternative for many, leaving clinicians with little to offer patients and their families.",

We are now exploring PMO therapy for disease models that have greater clinical relevance, such as ARDS. Murine models of ARDS have been well established in the literature and are typically created by intratracheal delivery of the endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [3]. In this study, we induce ARDS in rats, deliver OMB or control solutions to the peritoneal cavity with an ambulatory infusion device, and evaluate PMO therapy as a treatment compared to control solutions.",

Animals were acclimated for 4 days after arriving to the facility. Arterial blood was collected from a catheter placed in the femoral artery. The infusion circuit was created by inserting a 16-gauge catheter and a peritoneal lavage catheter (JP7, MILA International, Inc., Erlanger, KY) into the intraperitoneal (IP) cavity. All the catheters are tunneled subcutaneously to the back where they are fixed to a custom pedestal at least 3 days prior to the beginning of the study. ARDS was induced by directly administering LPS to the lungs through the trachea. Baseline measurements of weight, chest radiographs (Corix Pro 70, Corix Medical Systems, Mexico, NM), pulse oximetry (PhysioSuite MouseSTAT\u00ae, Kent Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT), and arterial blood are taken. Blood gas analysis was performed with a handheld blood analyzer (VetScan iSTAT 1, Abaxis, Union City, CA). Rats are then sedated with 5% isoflurane to deliver 0.5 mL aqueous solution of LPS (7 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) mixed with pure saline with a MicroSprayer\u00aeAerosolizer (Model IA-1B-R, PennCentury, Wyndmoor, PA).",

Even with this limited and reduced system, there appears to be short-term improvement in survival and reduction of hypoxia. Of note, this treatment effect has not reached statistical significance due to the small sample size of this pilot study. In future trials, rats will be infused with either no solution, sterile oxygenated saline, and inert gas microbubbles (IMBs) as controls or OMBs for PMO therapy. Four rats will be tested from each group resulting in 16 experiments. OMB and IMB infusate at 70% volume fraction will be provided by the Borden Laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO. Upon completion with the complete PDS and desired IP infusion rate, the effect of PMO therapy on survival, lung health, and oxygen saturation will be evaluated thoroughly.",
