The most common trigger of erythroderma is an exacerbation of an underlying dermatitis, most commonly psoriasis (Fig. 19.3) (23%), atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis [4\u20137]. Drug reaction is another important cause of erythroderma, implicated in 20% of cases, with at least 135 drugs suspected as potential causative agents [5\u20138, 10]. A common malignancy associated with erythroderma is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL) [3, 7, 9]. Idiopathic erythroderma, where no cause can be elucidated despite thorough serial investigations, occurs in approximately 30% of cases. \u201c Red man\u2019s syndrome\u201d associated with rapid vancomycin infusion is considered to be an example of idiopathic erythroderma [3\u20135, 8, 10, 11].",
