Classic studies by Sigurs et al. showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, severe enough to require hospitalization, is a risk factor for asthma at the age of 7, 13 and 18 [1,2,3]. ng asthma at 6 years being more than four-fold higher compared with HRV- negative cases [4,5]. Other studies have reported that early human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection during infancy is also an independent risk factor for the development of preschool asthma [6]]. However, most studies have focused on RSV or HRV infections and only one of thm has evaluated the long-term evolution of viral coinfections, although focused exclusively on human bocavirus (HBoV) and HRV coinfections in 3 to 35 month-old children with their first or second wheezing episode [7].",

Our current results confirm that the most frequently identified viral coinfections are dual RSV-HRV and RSV-HBoV infections. Results from cohort studies evaluating the severity of acute respiratory viral coinfections are conflicting. Our group previously found that clinical severity was associated mainly with RSV infections, either alone or in combination with other viruses [15]. However, Asner et al.

The induction of a prevalent Th2-type response, with the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, results in a less robust and less efficient reaction to the infection, clinically presenting as increased disease severity and risk for future recurrent wheezing [17,18]. Several reports showed that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a key initiator of allergic airway responses [19] and significant negative correlation has been described between TSLP levels in induced sputum and FEV-1 in asthmatic children [20]. TSLP is secreted by RSV-infected airway epithelial cells (AECs) to promote the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) [21,22]. The activated DCs can then induce a Th2 cell polarization response in the lung, which could contribute the development of asthma in RSV-infected individuals, as well as induction of exacerbations in asthmatic RSV-infected patients. It has been suggested that the ability of RSV to induce TSLP expression by AECs is responsible for the subsequent Th2 aspects of the immune response [23]. Other recent studies performed in young children with HRV infection, have also found higher levels of nasal TSLP [24,25].",

IL-33 is responsible for the immunopathophysiological response observed following neonatal RSV infection in mice. Its presence in nasal aspirates of human infants with severe RSV, together with the finding that by blocking the receptor of interleukin 33 in vivo [28], Th2 responses are greatly reduced, suggest it has a role in disease severity and asthma [29]. Our findings, in a recent study conducted in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis and in healthy controls, showed that nasal TSLP and IL-33 are detected more frequently in viral coinfections than in single infections. In addition, infants with dual RSV+HRV infection were 9 times more likely to have detectable nasal TSLP and this association was independent of other factors such as age or illness severity [30]. It is worth noting that no patient with bronchiolitis but with negative viral detection had detectable levels of nasal TSLP or IL-33, suggesting that the release of these proteins may be mediated by respiratory viruses.",

As far as we know, only Lukkarinen et al [7] have compared the systemic Th1-type, Th2-type and proinflammatory cytokine profiles in young children with simple versus viral coinfection, being HRV and HBoV1 the viruses involved. They included hospitalized children less than 35 months of age with their first or second wheezing episode. They observed that wheezing children with HRV had higher proinflammatory responses than did those with HBoV1 or those with coinfection HRV+HBoV1, suggesting that HBoV1 may interfere with HRV-induced immune responses. Furthermore, this immunological response was accompanied by the clinical finding that children with HRV+HBoV1 wheeze tended to develop recurrent wheezing later and less often than did those with HRV wheeze. Our previous and current results suggest that an interaction may also occur in RSV and HRV coinfections, but in an opposite way, towards a predominant Th2 response that could increase the development of recurrent wheezing/asthma.",

Moreover, viral coinfection, allergic rhinitis and older age at admission seem also to be strong independent risk factors for asthma development in children previously hospitalised because of bronchiolitis. However, given the complexity of the immunological mechanisms involved, more studies are needed to confirm this association and better understand its physiopathological mechanism.",
