            "text": "Phosphinic dipeptides are generally acknowledged as transition-state analog inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases [1,2,3], a large and homogenous class of exopeptidases that specifically cleave the N-terminal amino acid residues of polypeptides and proteins and contain metal ion(s) in their active sites. Being ubiquitously distributed in subcellular organelles, cytoplasm, and cellular membranes throughout all of the biological kingdoms, these enzymes perform critical roles in physiological processes and diseases. In humans, they are responsible for processing peptides and proteins involved in, for example, angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cancer and metastasis, blood pressure regulation, and bacterial and protozoal infections [3,4,5]. The inhibitory potential of phosphinic dipeptides originates from two fundamental structural features that determine the competitive mechanism of binding, and govern the potency and specificity of the ligands. First, the presence of the central phosphinic functional group ensures steric and electronic resemblance to the scissile amide bond of hydrolyzed substrates in the tetrahedral transition state. This also involves the ability to coordinate with catalytic metal ion(s). Second, the optimized structures of the P1 and P1\u2032 side chains guarantee complementarity to the corresponding S1 and S1\u2032 binding pockets (encryptions according to the nomenclature proposed by Schechter and Berger to define the N-terminal, non-primed and C-terminal, primed residues of the scissile amide bond in peptide substrates, and the corresponding binding pockets [6]).",

Alanine aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase N, APN, M01.001, EC 3.4.11.2) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP, M17.001, EC 3.4.11.1) can be considered as the prototypical representatives. Importantly, the greatest results of inhibition were achieved for compounds comprising side chains originating from nonproteinogenic amino acids. Such fragments of optimal ligands are not trivial and can hardly be predicted by directly translating the results of studies on peptidyl substrates. These residues can be conveniently designed with the aid of molecular modeling methods; however, this process may demand a few iterations of design, synthesis, and evaluation. For example, it took us ten years to inhibit (Ki) mammalian APN and LAP by phosphinic dipeptides at a low nanomolar/subnanomolar level [7,8].",

A total of 900 commercially available aldehydes were selected as potential precursors of these P1\u2032 residues, while the P1 fragment (mimicking homophenylalanine) remained conserved. Docking analysis was performed with 52 crystal structures of 27 enzymes. In addition, P1\u2032-dehydrodipeptide analogs were included in the study, as the aldehydes may also be the substrates of the P1\u2032-unsaturated counterparts. One of the methods for their preparation involves substitution of P1-specific N-protected aminoalkyl-H-phosphinic acids with Morita\u2013Baylis\u2013Hillman acetates (Scheme 1) [9]. The latter are obtained by acetylation of allyl alcohols, which, in turn, are synthesized from aldehydes and alkyl acrylates. Similar to the saturated compounds, phosphinic dehydrodipeptides were reported as inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases, although to a lesser extent [10].",

The family contains enzymes widely occurring in living organisms, including alanyl, cystinyl, and lysyl aminopeptidases; leukotriene A4 hydrolase; and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases I and II [70]. These enzymes play different physiological roles and are also targets for treating various pathological states. Nine M1 aminopeptidases have been identified in humans, six of which have been associated with disorders [69]. For example, their altered activity has been connected with regulation of blood pressure controlling systems, resulting in hypertension and strokes [71]. M1 aminopeptidases are also involved in cancer development [69]. In particular, APN has been shown to be overexpressed in leukemia blasts in acute myeloid leukemia. APN is active in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis [72]. LTA4H has been associated with acute lung damage, while dysregulation of ERAP1, ERAP2, and IRAP can reflect the risk of autoimmune diseases. M1 aminopeptidases are receptors for viruses, for example, coronaviruses [73]. They are also connected with several infections caused by bacteria, for example, meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitides [74], or protozoans, for example, malaria transmitted by Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite aminopeptidase of this species is involved in the digestion of short hemoglobin-derived peptides and has been rated as a highly prospective therapeutic target [75,76].",

Phosphinic inhibitors with P1\u2032 aromatic rings functionalized with hydroxyl groups have been recognized as good inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases [7], as OH in the para position is well positioned to form hydrogen contacts with the carboxylate of Glu418. Flexibility of the side chain directs the aromatic ring towards Val385 and His388. Stacking of the ring with imidazole is facilitated by oxygen-containing groups, which change its character by the electron-withdrawal effect. The distance of 4.04 \u00c5 to the aromatic ring of Tyr477 causes additional stabilization through hydrophobic interactions. The C-terminal carboxyl group is pointed to Gly352. The compound has a nonnatural configuration on the \u03b1 carbon of the P1 fragment. This is not significant, as both arrangements gave rise to very similar inhibition potential. It is also typical to observe the 2-phenylethyl fragment of hPhe-based inhibitors; because of its high flexibility, the absolute configuration does not determine the activity [84]. The most specific compound, whose structure is based on the 5-amino-thiophen-2-yl residue, reproduces an interaction with Glu418 (involving NH2), but the heteroaromatic ring is less conveniently positioned compared with His388 (Figure S1). The P1\u2032 fragment is brought closer to the surface of the cavity, strengthening the influence of Thr384 and Val385. To our satisfaction, the binding energy calculated for a phosphinic dipeptide that was rationally designed, synthesized, and described in our previous studies (Ki = 0.69 nM) outscored the current structures [8]. However, starting materials with the specific P1 fragment (4-aminomethylphenyl) are not commercially available, and compound development demands a complex and multistep preparation. This can be considered an exception. In general, the structure proposed here surpasses known inhibitors.",

The two aromatic rings of 2-benzyloxyphenyl surround Tyr455 owing to the flexibility of the methoxy connection. This limits the opportunity for typical complexation. Similarly, the most specific phosphinic dipeptide bearing a diphenylmethyl residue does not employ the central phosphinate to coordinate with the zinc atom (Figure S5). Strong stacking interactions between aromatic systems shift the overall ligand\u2013protein architecture.

It is indispensable to produce vast amounts of enzymes that can cope with this task under different conditions. The M1 metallopeptidase family is 1 of 29 formally classified families and one of only three families in which the crystal structures of human enzymes were determined (Table 1). The other two families are M18 and M24. The functions of human M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase are still poorly understood. It participates in blood pressure regulation and maintenance of proper hydroelectrolytic balance, and it has also been associated with angiogenesis in breast cancer [85]. The active center of M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase contains two metal ions and is open to the central tunnel formed of 12 subunits. This gives the protein the opportunity to bind long peptides in a number of consecutive pockets. The S1 pocket is arranged to bind asparagine or glutamine, while the S1\u2032 pocket prefers small alkyl chain-type amino acid residues (Table 4). Human M24 aminopeptidases can be divided into two subgroups, namely methionine metallo-aminopeptidases and Xaa-Pro aminopeptidases. The two subgroups are differentiated based on the presence or absence of a common fold called the \u201cpitta bread\u201d. Similar to other aminopeptidases, their substrate specificity is broad [86]. The catalytic centers contain two cobalt or manganese ions. The enzymes differ in amino acid preferences and active site architecture (Table 4). For example, Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase 1 has a very small pocket specific for proline, while Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase 3, despite playing a similar function, has evolved to accept larger substrates.",

The S1 cleft of aspartyl aminopeptidase was able to adopt unexpectedly bulky polyaromatic residues, which were surrounded by the alkyl residues of Lys358, Leu405, Val407, Pro412, Cys413, and His359 (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking) (Figure S8). Tyr381 formed a hydrogen bond with an ether oxygen atom. For aminopeptidase P3, 3-phenylaziridin interacted with the catalytic residues Pro301 and Asp331 (NH of aziridine) and His413 and Arg438 (Figure S9). For methionyl aminopeptidase 2, the ligand did not typically point towards Met384, but docked in the shallow part of the S1 cleft, close to catalytic amino acids (Figure S10). The phenyl ring and fluorine atoms interacted with His231 and His382, while the boronyl group formed numerous hydrogen bonds with Ser224, Lys249, and Gln457. In all three discussed cases, the P1 phenylethyl fragment was nonspecifically arranged.",

The approach involved virtual screening of the inhibitors with commonly available molecular modeling tools. The optimized residues were not generated computationally, but were taken from the structures of commercially available synthetic precursors. This supposition should ensure the feasibility of the subsequent synthesis. The obtained dataset was analyzed considering stereochemical implications and selectivity of interactions in the enzyme active sites. The most potent, the most potent metal-interacting, and the most selective diastereomeric inhibitors that were calculated (by the lowest free binding energy) were thus identified. The structures of the optimized substituents appeared not evident and, quite surprisingly, not similar to those of proteinogenic residues. Two types of these structures were predominantly present. The first type included spatially extended P1\u2032 fragments of aromatic character, principally hydrophobic, such as aryl, heteroaryl, and arylakil. These residues were characterized by extremely tight insertion into the large S1\u2032 pockets. Substituents of a moderate size, but modified with two oxygen atom-containing group(s), for example, boronyl and dihydroxyl, represented the second most abundant group. Oxygen-comprising groups tended to form a favorable net of hydrogen bonds with the S1\u2032 residues of certain metallo-aminopeptidases. However, the presence of alternatives to phosphinate metal binding groups, such as boronyl and C-terminal carboxyl groups, gave rise to alterations in the typical substrate-like binding mode. Such changes were the most frequent for aminopeptidases with small substrate-oriented S1\u2032 subsites. Reorientation of the overall direction of binding was also observed in some cases. Enriched by such binding mode details, the method can be recommended as general to design specified residues of inhibitors of peptidomimetic structures.",

Nevertheless, regressions that involved limited datasets showed clearer tendencies. For the first relationship, we selected the universal inhibitor (bestatin), which was assayed with several aminopeptidases, and prepared the plot of \u0394G versus pKi (Table 9). Although the correlation coefficient for the linear regression is not remarkable (R2 = 0.65), the trend is visible. Much more pronounced correlation (R2 = 0.91) was envisaged for the specified type of inhibitors (phosphinic (dehydro)dipeptide analogs) and a single aminopeptidase (human aminopeptidase N, M01.001, Figure 11).
