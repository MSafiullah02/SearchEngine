Flashmobs ravage innocent bystanders, online raves spring up and just as quickly die out, protesters flair-up on Wall Street and then disappear. Why? These bursts occur because of the increasingly connected super hive we call the Internet. More importantly, they rise and fall because of how society is wired together. Ever-tightening self-organization and the resulting hub-like structure of society magnifies the impact and spreads these events like a wildfire. If you want to control the Internet animali, seek out and control the center.",

Like gathering storm clouds that eventually turn into a torrent of rain, these animali unleash a torrent of abuse and destruction on the people and buildings around them. In some countries, like the USA, the assembly of youth looking for a thrill has become a major problem for law enforcement. These flashes of humanity are called Flashmobs. And, they can kill. On September 29, 2002, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 16 young people suddenly appeared and beat a man to death after throwing an egg at him. On November 23, 2007 one hundred people ransacked a convenience store for no apparent reason. Seven people brutally attacked a man in a parking garage in Columbia, Missouri on June 6, 2009. One hundred and twenty juveniles tore up a Wal-Mart store in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Teens accosted and assaulted innocent pedestrians in Silver Springs, Maryland, and 950 people went on a rampage in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, in 2010. During a short decade from 2002 to 2012, over 150 incidents were reported at http://violentflashmobs.com.",

From Fig. 2 .1 you can see that most flashmobs are small, but a few rare ones are large. There is no such thing as an average uprising, rave, or flashmob incident. Instead, there are many insignificant uprisings, raves, and flashmobs happening all the time, but once in a while really significant flashes happen. Some flashmobs unleash such a torrent that they topple entire governments. These are the so-called black swans [Lewis 2011 ]. Flashmob distributions are also fractals because of their self-similarity. Big events mimic small events, and vice versa. A magnified slice of the curve in Fig. 2 .1 is shaped just like the entire curve, signifying that large mobs are magnified small mobs. [We also say self-similarity is a form of scalability, because changing the scale of the plot does not change its shape]. The slope of the exceedence curve plotted on log-log paper equals the fractal dimension of the phenomenon. In fact the length of the curve's tail is quantified in terms of the slope or fractal dimension of the curve. A long-tailed exceedence curve says big events are rare, but still more likely to happen than expected. The tail is longer and fatter for low fractal dimensions, and shorter for high fractal dimensions.",

[The average number of friends on Facebook is typically 130-150]. Now suppose the social network is dense, meaning that many neighbors influence a typical actor. In this scenario, the average number of links per node is 20. How do mobs form in a dense network? As it turns out, flashes disappear once again. The sizes of both RED and BLUE mobs obey Normal distributions centered on 50 % of the actors. Flashmob size is purely random and no pattern emerges.

Lasn and White were hubs in the Adbuster network, because they were ''connected'' to 70,000 subscribers. Their influence far outweighed all other actors. What impact does a hub actor have on the rest? Assuming no conviction and the number of neighbors of the pinned RED actor is twice that of the pinned BLUE actor, the size distribution of mobs is still longtailed as before. But the tail of RED is much longer than BLUE. In fact, the size of the largest BLUE mob rarely exceeds 10 % of the population. The initial position of the pinned hub dominates the positions of nearly all actors. The effect on RED is to elongate its long-tailed distribution. The effect on BLUE is to radically shorten its tail. In other words, network structure introduces extreme groupings. Pinning a hub introduces polarization of the network.

Therefore, power over the entire network rises with an increase in spectral radius.

            "text": "What do these simulations tell us about Internet animali? I summarize the results shown in Fig. 2 .7 through 2.9: 1. Flashmob formation is a Levy Flight in size and elapsed time between switches in majority opinion when the social network is sparse and conviction is low. Low conviction accelerates the rate of self-organization. Large flashmobs quickly form when actors lacking conviction listen to a small number of strong influencers. On the contrary, large flashmobs are inhibited from forming when conviction is high or actors listen to more than a dozen neighbors. Too many influences attenuate flashmob intensity and retard the rate of self-organization. 2. A pinned RED actor dominates BLUE actors if its number of neighbors exceeds the number of neighbors of BLUE, and vice versa. If you want to steer mobs in one direction, start with the most connected actor. Revolutions are started and successfully completed by highly connected and strong actors simply because number of links equals influence. A small advantage in terms of connectivity accelerates the rate of self-organization. 3. Structured networks with a large pinned hub are dominated by the initial position of the hub. This structure introduces additional extremes-the tail of the hub distribution is longer, and the tail of the subordinate actor distribution is shorter. The larger the hub, the easier it is to control the network and the larger is the flashmob. A hub amplifies influence-a scale-free network amplifies influence of the hub even more. 4 Self-organization-as measured by spectral radius-is enhanced by hub size. 4. Structured networks with large hubs change majorities more often when the pinned initial RED and BLUE actors have more links than when they have fewer links. Hub size introduces volatility. Conversely, fewer links means longer elapsed times between majority switching. Pinning highly connected actors introduces more volatility, and pinning slightly connected actors introduces stronger majorities. When conviction is low, flashmobs can be whiplashed back and forth by highly connected actors. Self-organization goes handin-hand with hub size, setting up competition between RED and BLUE when both networks contain large hubs. Clearly these simulation results have important applications. Whether in advertising, marketing of web sites, promotion of political campaigns, or simply understanding the dynamics of socio-political movements around the globe, flashmob behavior modification is a matter of pulling the right levers. Mob formation has little to do with human nature and psychology, and much to do with conviction and the inclination of your neighbors. Power and influence is a mechanical property of boulevardiers, activists, and trendsetters. Persuasion can be had simply by shaping the topology of the network. Function follows form.",
