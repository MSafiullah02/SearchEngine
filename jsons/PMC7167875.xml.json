Infections by coronaviruses are usually limited to the upper airways and are clinically indistinguishable from other upper respiratory infections caused by numerous other viruses. The clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections are essentially those of the so\u2010called \u2018common colds\u2019, that need little or at most symptomatic treatment (5). In some cases, however, lower respiratory infections can occur, causing bronchitis, bronchiolitis and even pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by coronaviruses has never been described (6). On the contrary, coronaviruses can also induce non\u2010respiratory symptoms such as abdominal pain and acute diarrhea.",

In a study on hospitalized patients with acute respiratory infections, it was demonstrated that rhinovirus and coronavirus were both associated with lower respiratory tract illnesses in all age groups. In children <5 years, the predominant clinical syndromes were pneumonia and bronchiolitis; while in older children and young adults, exacerbations of asthma were the predominant manifestation (7). In a recent study on infants hospitalized for acute wheezing, rhinoviruses were found to be the most important triggers (33%) and were associated with the development of asthma. In that study on wheezy infants, coronaviruses could not be identified (8). These results are in concordance with those of a study from Hungary, showing that antibody levels to coronavirus OC43 reached a peak between 15 and 19 years of age, while rates of positive sera were lowest before 1 year of age (9).",

The fact that children developed a milder form of illness is not unique to infection with the SARS coronavirus, as a number of other respiratory infections behave in the same way, such as influenza, infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae, and even varicella. One possible explanation is that children may enjoy cross\u2010immunity persisting after recent exposures to other coronaviruses. Cross\u2010protection from childhood vaccination [e.g. measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine] has also been postulated in the popular press (14), but no scientific data on the subject are available. However, if children were protected by MMR vaccination, it would be expected that younger non\u2010vaccinated children would develop severe SARS but this has not been the case. Furthermore, there is no reason why adults should not also be protected by MMR vaccination.",

In those patients suffering from severe SARS (20%), a biphasic clinical pattern was noted (15). After an initial phase of fever and respiratory symptoms, these patients experience spontaneous improvement. However, after 8 days a second phase starts, which is characterized by more severe respiratory symptoms (i.e. ARDS) and diarrhea (see Fig. 2). It has been shown that the second phase is unrelated to viral replication, but may be related to immunopathological damage (15). In children, it seems that the second phase does not occur, which can be the result of low immune response to the virus. Children can develop the mild first phase, but seem to be protected against the severe second phase of ARDS.",

            "text": "An explanation for this is unknown at the moment, but it could be the result of differences in macrophages features between adults and children. From an anatomopathological study on postmortem lung samples of SARS patients, a giant\u2010cell infiltrate was seen with a pronounced increase in macrophages (CD68\u2010positive cells) in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lungs (16). This infiltrate is different from the infiltrate seen in non\u2010SARS ARDS, which comprises activated neutrophils (and has increased levels of interleukin 8), and which can occur in both adults and children (17). Therefore, it seems that activated macrophages play an important role in severe SARS. The lack of activation of macrophages by SARS\u2010CoV could be the reason why children do not develop severe SARS (i.e. ARDS during the second phase). A possibility could be that children lack expression of the receptors for SARS\u2010CoV on their macrophages. Although, children are vulnerable to non\u2010SARS coronaviruses, it could be that the SARS\u2010CoV uses different receptors. It has been shown that the first step in HCoV\u2010229E infection is binding of the trimeric 200\u2010KDa viral spike glycoprotein (S) to its receptor on human cells, identified as human aminopeptidase N (hAPN, CD13) (18). SARS\u2010CoV likely uses other receptors to penetrate into macrophages. It would be of worth to focus research on the differences in macrophage features between adults and children during infection with SARS\u2010CoV.",

We saw little of the usual influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections. We attribute the decrease in acute respiratory infections and acute asthma attacks to the changes Singaporeans have had to make to their lifestyle. These changes included the closure of schools for a period of time, stepped\u2010up public hygiene measures and the wearing of facemasks.",

Procedures capable of stimulating cough and promoting the generation of aerosols include administration of aerosolized medication treatment, diagnostic sputum induction, bronchoscopy, airway suctioning and endotracheal intubation.
