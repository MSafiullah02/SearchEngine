We propose leveraging this history to identify opportunities for actual progress. We contrast current plans with historical outbreak control measures and isolate how the complexities of a modern era yield additional challenges in how best to anticipate and mitigate outbreaks. We analyze a diversity of publicly available modern preparedness plans against the context of a historically-based fictional outbreak control strategy described in Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year (published 1720). We identify themes in preparedness planning that remain unchanged from historical settings even though they continue to be actively evaluated in planning efforts. More importantly, we isolate critical modern challenges in preparedness planning that remain predominantly unsolved. These modern, unsolved issues offer best avenues for meaningful improvement. Shifting our planning efforts to focus on identified novel issues may greatly strengthen our local-to global-capacity to deal with infectious threats.",

A great deal of effort has been expended advancing state-of-the-art preparedness, developing sophisticated computational models, developing and improving response plans, and streamlining the development and deployment of pharmaceutical interventions, among others. Many of these preparedness responses, while beneficial, begin building a pandemic response infrastructure from the ground up as the epidemic unfolds. Public health planners can draw on strategies with a long history of success in controlling (though not necessarily eliminating) infectious diseases.",

Nor are today's official governmental plans to help mitigate these diseases necessarily new. For example, the word \"quarantine\" originates from a Venetian policy confining sailors to their ships for a period of time before being allowed into a city (1) , and the calls for travel restrictions echo a Florentine attempt to control the plague by banning the importation of certain types of fruit (2) and by prohibition of entry into the city of those who were visibly ill (3) . A reflection on the techniques used in the past to attempt to contain outbreaks may yield new insights. It may expose those paths that have yielded the greatest benefits and highlight other weapons in the public heath arsenal that, despite vast leaps in technology, remain fundamentally unchanged. This reflection is especially important during the present COVID-19 pandemic, when a combination of constrained supply chains and no readily available pharmaceutical treatments or vaccines mean, for the moment, that some of the most technologically sophisticated tools used by public health are unavailable.",

The book is a fictional recounting of a year of life in London during the Great Plague of London in 1665, the last major epidemic of bubonic plague to strike Europe. While not a contemporary account of the plague, though there is some suspicion that it is based on the journal of Defoe's uncle, it is a detailed account of the actual public health practices of the time and the methods used to attempt to slow the spread of the disease (5, 6) . By examining the policies recounted in the text, we can consider whether or not current preparedness plans are, in fact, novel, or if there are certain common modes of intervention with roots that pre-date not only modern epidemiology as a field, but also an understanding of Germ Theory. This understanding, beyond its historical interest, may be beneficial to modern pandemic planning. Planners can identify areas that have not substantially changed in centuries and are not likely to be a source of major innovation as well as identifying \"basic\" tools that require neither disease specific nor modern administrative support. These tools, in turn, are ones that can be thought of as forming the foundation of a response plan during periods of high uncertainty about the biological and epidemiological properties of the pathogen itself, and where more technologically-driven and pathogen-specific responses may not yet be in place.",

They may also be positive changes which can be exploited, such as vastly improved nutrition and access to medical care, or the development of pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines or antivirals. Finally, some of the differences between historical and modern preparedness plans may represent a new context that must be addressed, such as changes in governmental scope and scale, and the increasing specialization of healthcare.

Scientific and technological advancement are certainly the most immediate changes in our efforts to prepare for epidemiological threats. Our understand of how to prepare for and/or affect the course of infectious disease outbreaks is enhanced by a number of advances. The emergence of medicine as a scientific field, including the isolation of disease-causing agents is perhaps the foremost, accompanied by improvements in our understanding of immunology, microbiology, epidemiology and physiology, as well as the now-available pharmacopoeia of preventative and therapeutic treatments. Science, however, has not provided a panacean set of solutions such that biosafety and preparedness are solved problems, or ones with inherently technological solutions, especially early in an emerging epidemic. As our scientific understanding has increased, so has our realization of the scope of diversity and complexity of the threats. While some medical advances provide across-the-board increases in health and resilience to disease challenges, such as improved nutrition or hand hygiene, few provide such broad protection as to be effective against the host of potential pandemic threats we face such that no further effort would be required. Similarly, technological advances in medicine have improved the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic testing, analysis of data for detection/surveillance, the scope and sophistication of contact tracing and delivery mechanisms for a variety of therapies. In examining how the modern era has changed relative to the past in these regards, nothing is fundamentally changed -preparedness planning must consider the capabilities and limitations of the understanding and methods available for each type of anticipated threat and decide how best to exploit the tools available. The tools have changed, but not their impact.",

More than any period in the past, a true quarantine that allows nothing in or out of any large-enough area is likely to lead very quickly to a practical crisis more akin to historical sieges than historical public health efforts (7). This has become readily apparent as various state and national-level shutdowns have disrupted international shipping and supply chains during COVID-19, confusion and conflict over the import and export of medical supplies, and competition at the national and even sub-national level for equipment and tools necessary to address the outbreak.

Critically, this implies that for a plan to be successful, it must survive oversight from and participation by many different individual and organizational parties. These overlapping plans require an understanding of relationships and dependencies between plans, how they are coordinated, and how two or more plans that call for mutually contradictory actions are resolved. This understanding, in turn, requires both research and deliberate planning into how multiscale preparedness systems work when taken as a cascading network of related plans, rather than a collection of distinct entities.",

Similarly, the decisions for some preparedness plans may appropriately lie entirely within the hands of clinicians, while others may require considerable input from policy makers, politicians, or other interest groups.

There are, with near certainty, individuals and organizations who expect to be in a decision making role who will not be, and similarly those anticipating the needed decisions and information will flow from somewhere else when they are, in fact, at the appropriate position and scale to make the decisions themselves. Both are potentially catastrophic misunderstandings of their position within a multi-scale preparedness system.

In asking various agencies and actors to generate their own preparedness plans over the past decade, without providing a unified framework by which to do so, we have effectively asked many smart and dedicated people to reinvent the wheel without ever asking if we might instead improve the axle. While it is definitely the case that involvement of crowd-sourced brainstorming from the modern diversity of entities engaged in trying to protect the health of the public and/or continue to function during a public health crisis may have uncovered previously unconsidered elements for inclusion, to the best of our knowledge, no publicly available proposed plan has discovered a fundamentally new category of endeavor. We strongly recommend that, going forward, we refine, adopt, and provide a single, general framework (based on, if not actually the one here presented) as a starting point from which any entity may create their own response plan by effectively filling in the blanks, but that the efforts required not stop there. Rather than considering the independent response plans from each player to be the endpoint of our preparations, we believe that the completion of these plans should be where the investment in active planning begins. We need to foster, even require by federal, state, and local regulation, the creation of integration/collaboration plans among agencies and actors-both government and industry. We need to dedicate time, energy and thought to research and devise a rubric of best practices for how to integrate action plans among entities who have not explicitly discussed integration of their plans prior to identification of the threat. And resources must be devoted to keeping these plans and their integrations current -in many agencies critical roles may be filled by a single person who may switch jobs or retire, and in the urgency of an ongoing crisis it may be unclear what resources and expertise might be available (e.g. if a local university has experts-or graduate students-available to assist). Too often this sort of response rests on the institutional knowledge of a few key individuals, rather than in a maintainable and transparent system. The current model of presuming that the most critical collaborations will be practiced in advance and all others will be able to act in efficient concert together on the fly is clearly optimistic, at best. We need to define rules of play, consider the modularity of actions, and the transitivity of command. These critical aspects have been predominantly under-studied in favor of parallel efforts to brainstorm individual plans. We believe that, rather than being the afterthought once the plan is finalized, they hold the greatest potential for advancement of the science and social practice of public health preparedness in our modern era.

In 2008, the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) conducted an exercise in Montgomery County, Maryland to test a proposed response scenario of quarantine due to an avian flu outbreak. Evaluations of the exercise identified several problems that could affect emergency response, but highlighted how officials relied too heavily on independent information technologies and confusion between state and county roles compromised public health efforts (8). Similarly, during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, emergency officials identified the need for better communication and coordination between emergency personnel as a critical gap in their ability to respond effectively to the situation (9). These are merely two examples among many, but the point remains the same: any endeavor that involves multiple agencies, acting on varieties of scales, and with sometimes conflicting missions will require substantial planning, relationship building between stakeholders, and practice in coordination before all can work effectively and efficiently. There are successful examples of this -the San Diego County Division of Public Health Services conducted a review of its first experience as a designated lead agency during the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza outbreak (40, and a series of training exercises in Minnesota following an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza helped clarify how industry stakeholders integrated into preparedness efforts (41. Incident command training should and canbe done in response to potential threats, not only reviews of emergencies or how to perform for the next time the emergency hits. The United States Department of Agriculture had a four-day tabletop exercise with 14 states, public health labs, and industry to help learn incident command for everyone and potential issues for African Swine Fever(42).",
