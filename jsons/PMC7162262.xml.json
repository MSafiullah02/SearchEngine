            "text": "Initial work suggested that DC\u2010SIGN was required for efficient MDDC\u2010mediated HIV trans\u2010infection (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000). Albeit this finding is controversial (Gummuluru et al., 2003; Boggiano et al., 2007), a number of reports indicate that blockade of DC\u2010SIGN by either antibodies, carbohydrates (Baribaud et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007a) or RNAi (2004a, 2004b) indeed diminishes HIV trans\u2010infection (Gurney et al., 2005). In addition, DC\u2010SIGN promotes HIV dissemination by migratory cells from cervical explants (Hu et al., 2004). However, the indicated role of DC\u2010SIGN in HIV trans\u2010infection by dendritic cells is not universal. Thus, different types of dendritic cells employ different C\u2010type lectins, DC\u2010SIGN, mannose receptor (MR) and langerin, as well as CD4 for binding to HIV Env, and dendritic cell maturation shifts Env capture from lectins to CD4 (Turville et al., 2002). Accordingly, DC\u2010SIGN is believed to contribute to HIV trans\u2010infection mediated by immature but not by mature dendritic cells (Izquierdo\u2010Useros et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007a), although one study reached a different conclusion (Baribaud et al., 2002), and coexpression of CD4 was found to diminish DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated trans\u2010infection, possibly by facilitating uptake and transport of HIV into late endosomal compartments (Wang et al., 2007b). The list of lectins involved in HIV attachment to dendritic cells was recently expanded to include the C\u2010type lectin DCIR (dendritic cell immunoreceptor), but the relative contributions of DC\u2010SIGN and DCIR to HIV trans\u2010infection remain to be established (Lambert et al., 2008). Finally, HIV attachment to dendritic cells can also proceed in a lectin\u2010 and CD4\u2010independent fashion (de Witte et al., 2007a; Hatch et al., 2009; Izquierdo\u2010Useros et al., 2009). Thus, dendritic cells have multiple means to capture HIV, and the prevalent mode of viral binding depends on the origin and the maturation status of the cells.",

An LL motif in the cytoplasmic tail of DC\u2010SIGN facilitates ligand endocytosis by DC\u2010SIGN (Engering et al., 2002). However, a contribution of the LL motif to HIV transmission by DC\u2010SIGN expressing cell lines was not observed by a subsequent study (Burleigh et al., 2006), and the role of a low pH compartment in HIV trans\u2010infection has been questioned (Nobile et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007a). The former observation is in agreement with work demonstrating that DC\u2010SIGN contributes to HIV uptake into dendritic cells, but targets the majority of internalized virions for degradation and MHC presentation (2004, 2006) (Fig. 1). The identification of LSP1 as a cellular binding partner of the cytoplasmic tail of DC\u2010SIGN further supports such a scenario (Smith et al., 2007). Thus, normal expression of LSP1 diverts HIV into the proteasome of dendritic cells, while LSP1 knock\u2010down increases trans\u2010infection (Smith et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Regardless of the role of DC\u2010SIGN, it is undisputed that HIV is efficiently taken up into dendritic cells and important differences between immature and mature dendritic cells have been noted (Frank et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007a). Thus, virions taken up into mature dendritic cells accumulate in large endocytic compartments, which resemble structures seen in macrophages upon HIV uptake by macropinocytosis (Wang et al., 2007a). In comparison, virions associated with immature dendritic cells are mostly found close to the cell surface, with only a few virions being present in intracellular vesicles, which exhibit a clathrin\u2010coat (Wang et al., 2007a). Notably, the ability to traffic HIV into deep intracellular compartments was found to correlate with protection of virus from proteases, and inhibitors of intracellular trafficking and cytoskeleton integrity were shown to inhibit trans\u2010infection (2007a, 2008b), in agreement with the proposal that HIV traffics intracellularly, via a tetraspanin\u2010sorting pathway, to infectious synapses (Garcia et al., 2005). In contrast, a separate study postulated that virions reach infectious synapses exclusively by transport on the cell surface instead of travelling along intracellular routes (Cavrois et al., 2007). In agreement with this scenario, it was reported that HIV is routed towards the infectious synapse in a surface accessible, intracellular compartment (Yu et al., 2008). Irrespective of the route of HIV trafficking, there is ample evidence that HIV capture does not preserve viral infectivity (Turville et al., 2004; Nobile et al., 2005; Burleigh et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007a), with the initially postulated conservation of viral infectivity likely being due to productive infection of the transmitting cells (Nobile et al., 2005; Burleigh et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Recent studies revealed a novel facet of HIV interactions with DC\u2010SIGN on dendritic cells, the modulation of the immune response. It was demonstrated that binding of HIV to MDDCs induces ERK\u2010dependent signal transduction, which correlates with production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL\u201010 and compromised maturation of dendritic cells (Shan et al., 2007). These effects were dependent on appropriate Env glycosylation and on C\u2010type lectin expression, and a role of DC\u2010SIGN was postulated (Shan et al., 2007). Removal of mannose\u2010rich glycans from Env improved immunogenicity of the protein (Banerjee et al., 2009), further pointing towards a role of mannose\u2010specific lectins in immune responses shaped by dendritic cells. In agreement with these findings, HIV binding to DC\u2010SIGN on dendritic cells was demonstrated to induce signalling via the Rho guanine nucleotide\u2013exchange factor LARG and the small GTPase RhoA, which results in aberrant dendritic cell maturation (Hodges et al., 2007). Thus, the cells fail to upregulate CD86 and MHC II but readily form infectious synapses with T cells (Hodges et al., 2007), indicating that HIV signalling via DC\u2010SIGN compromises the immune function of dendritic cells and simultaneously primes the cells for trans\u2010infection. A separate study showed that binding of HIV to DC\u2010SIGN induces signals via a multi\u2010protein complex, including the kinase Raf\u20101, which modulates TLR\u2010induced cytokine production by regulating acetylation of the NF\u03baB subunit p65 (Gringhuis et al., 2007). Interestingly, activation of Raf\u20101 was dependent on LARG and RhoA and on the carbohydrate profile of the pathogen bound to DC\u2010SIGN. Thus, HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which bound to DC\u2010SIGN via high\u2010mannose residues, activated Raf\u20101 signalling and induced production of a cytokine profile different from that triggered by Helicobacter pylori, which was due to recognition of fucose containing structures and did not involve Raf\u20101 activation (Gringhuis et al., 2009) (1, 2). Finally, signalling via TLR8 and DC\u2010SIGN was required for NF\u03baB\u2010dependent recruitment of the transcription factor pTEF\u2010b to the viral promoter, and thus for the generation of full\u2010length HIV transcripts in dendritic cells \u2013 a prerequisite for productive infection (Gringhuis et al., 2010) (Fig. 2). However, HIV infection of dendritic cells is inefficient compared with T cells and macrophages (reviewed by Wu and KewalRamani, 2006), and a contribution of this mechanism to viral spread in vivo remains to be established. In sum, DC\u2010SIGN has signalling capacity, which can be exploited by pathogens to modulate immune responses and to establish productive infection of dendritic cells and adjacent target cells.",

            "text": "Langerhans cells are located in the top layer of the mucosa and are most likely the first cell type to come in contact with sexually transmitted HIV. Langerhans cells are DC\u2010SIGN\u2010negative but express CD4 and the C\u2010type lectin langerin (Soilleux and Coleman, 2001). Pioneer work by de Witte and colleagues provided evidence that langerin constitutes a defence mechanism against HIV invasion (de Witte et al., 2007b). Thus, langerin binds to Env and targets bound virions into Birbeck granules, an intracellular compartment specific to Langerhans cells, where the virus is degraded (de Witte et al., 2007b). Counter\u2010intuitively, however, C\u2010type lectins were reported to play a minor role in HIV entry into vaginal Langerhans cells (Hladik et al., 2007), and examination of skin explants inoculated with HIV indicated HIV infection of Langerhans cells, but not other types of dendritic cells, and transfer of virus from Langerhans cells to T cells (Kawamura et al., 2008). The latter observations suggest that infection of Langerhans cells might be an important early event in HIV transmission. Such a scenario can be reconciled with the findings of de Witte and colleagues, when taking into account that the barrier imposed by langerin can be overcome by high doses of virus (de Witte et al., 2007b) and that TNF\u2010\u03b1, produced upon genital coinfections, like candida albicans, might increase permissiveness of Langerhans cells to HIV infection (de Jong et al., 2008b) \u2013 hypotheses that should be tested in animal models.",

            "text": "DC\u2010SIGN is targeted by different viruses which all contain envelope proteins with an appropriate glycan signature. Three major consequences of viral engagement of DC\u2010SIGN have been described: first, DC\u2010SIGN can function as a bona fide entry receptor. In this case, expression of DC\u2010SIGN is sufficient to render cells susceptible to infection. Such a scenario has been suggested, e.g. for dendritic cell infection by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV\u20108) (Rappocciolo et al., 2008), the causative agent of Karposi sarcoma and for Ebolavirus infection of T cells (Alvarez et al., 2002). However, it is technically challenging to discriminate between entry mediated solely by DC\u2010SIGN (receptor function) and entry augmented by DC\u2010SIGN but facilitated by a coexpressed receptor, a process termed cis\u2010infection (Lee et al., 2001). In fact, DC\u2010SIGN most likely functions as an attachment factor in the context of Ebolavirus entry into lymphoid cells (Marzi et al., 2007). Second, DC\u2010SIGN might augment cis\u2010infection, as described above. DC\u2010SIGN\u2010driven cis\u2010infection has been established for dengue virus infection of dendritic cells, which are important early targets of this pathogen (Lozach et al., 2005). Polymorphisms in the DC\u2010SIGN gene were shown to impact disease development, suggesting that cis\u2010infection might facilitate viral spread in patients (Sakuntabhai et al., 2005). Third, DC\u2010SIGN can promote trans\u2010infection of target cells. While this route has first been established for HIV, trans\u2010infection of several viruses by DC\u2010SIGN has been demonstrated, including Measles virus (de Witte et al., 2008) and Ebolavirus (Alvarez et al., 2002), and might promote transmission of these pathogens. Whether DC\u2010SIGN engagement by viruses other than HIV also modulates cytokine release and thus impacts the establishment of an immune response remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Detailed information on the processes ensuing exposure of anogenital mucosa to sexually transmitted HIV is indispensable to understand viral dissemination and pathogenesis and to develop effective antiviral strategies. There is continued and well founded belief that dendritic cells play an important role in the establishment of HIV infection. However, the idea of the role of DC\u2010SIGN in HIV interactions with dendritic cells has changed considerably (Fig. 1). It has become clear that dendritic cells have several means to bind and transfer HIV to cells, with C\u2010type lectins being one of them. In addition, an appreciable protection of HIV from antiviral agents upon attachment to dendritic cells is under discussion, and the concept of long\u2010term storage and subsequent regurgitation of infectious HIV by dendritic cells had to be abandoned. On the other hand, DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated HIV trans\u2010infection, although found to be a short\u2010lived process, and cis\u2010infection might promote viral amplification in the genital mucosal, which could be critical for the establishment of the primary infection. Conversely, langerin on Langerhans cells was discovered to target HIV for degradation, suggesting a barrier function of this lectin. Finally, intriguing new findings revealed a signalling capacity of DC\u2010SIGN (and other lectins), which is exploited by HIV to compromise immune defences and to promote its spread. Vaccine development should therefore encompass the optimization of the glycan profiles of candidate substances, and new strategies for immunotherapy can be envisioned. Ultimately, key concepts need to be evaluated in improved cell culture systems and animal models for sexual transmission of HIV. An important but often overlooked parameter determining outcome and significance of such experiments is the source of the virus. Glycosylation of HIV depends on the producer cell type, and viruses generated in macrophages are unlikely to be detected efficiently by C\u2010type lectins on mucosal dendritic cells (Lin et al., 2003). Consequently, these viruses might overcome the mucosal barrier with different efficiency and potentially by employing different strategies compared with viruses generated in T cells \u2013 and similar considerations apply to most if not all other DC\u2010SIGN ligands.",

Second, dendritic cells can transfer captured virus (input virus) to adjacent target cells without becoming productively infected, a pathway termed trans\u2010infection. Trans\u2010infection occurs at infectious synapses, contact points between dendritic cells and T cells, and HIV might traffic to infectious synapses via intracellular and extracellular routes. The latter trafficking pathway might involve transport of HIV in intracellular but surface connected compartments.
