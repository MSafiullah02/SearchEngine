This research did not only observe the factors for FDI but also the effect of FDI in terms of capital to the economic quantity and cost of production.

Yet AFTA actually benefits market efficiency, positive competitiveness in the private sector, and provides more choices for consumers. Regionalism is in fact government action at regional level for the benefit of private sectors and consumers. 2 In Southeast Asia, local economic liberalization implemented by influential founding members (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) is very important as a key-success factor for building a solid regional economic commitment in ASEAN (Ravenhill 1995).",

Therefore, trade creation's negative effect would strike domestic firms. Trade diversion emerges when member states of a particular regional organization import commodities from other member states because after the implementation of preferential tariff arrangement with countries in the same region, tariff within members are lower than tariff between member and non-member states of the region. Tariff discrimination arising from a regional agreement causes member states' less-competitive products to be cheaper than those produced by more-competitive non-member states. Therefore, if a particular region generates a trade creation effect greater than its trade diversion effect, less-competitive member states will suffer more than non-member states, yet if trade diversion effect is higher than its trade creation effect then non-member states will suffer more than member states. Scholars argue that when trade diversion is higher than trade creation, the incentives to invest increase more than the incentive to do trade as non-member states attempt to avoid the cost of being excluded from the region. 4 This references review will discuss trade creation (intra-regional trade), trade diversion and its investment creation (FDI inflows).

They combined a macroeconomic approach and firm survey (microeconomic) approach to assess FDI flows from the USA to Europe and Asia. They separated FDI values into two groups: FDI stock and FDI flows. For dynamic analysis purposes their research adopted FDI flows as a dependent variable. This model uses multiple OLS regression models and takes regional trade agreement as dummy variable. They adopted factors which affected FDI flows such as product differentiation, technological intensive, capital intensity, and firm size. They argue that most of the previous studies focused on static market entry instead of the FDI's dynamic trends. They argue that the novelty of their research is on more details data on a country's infrastructure, geographic proximity, sociocultural similarities, region basis offering non-tariff barriers of intra-regional trade and networking opportunities.",

In fact, differing from most of the previous studies that show that GNP or GDP, or GDP per capita have positive relations with FDI inflows, their research found the opposite especially in the case of Asia. Using region as a dummy variable (Europe and Asia), they found that the USA's FDI flows have been relocated from Europe to Asia because the investment pressures in Europe were tighter than those in Asia. This increased FDI and employment creation in Asia, reduced the cost of production in the USA, but at the same time reduced labor absorption in the USA (hollowing-out). They also found that population is not significant in attracting FDI inflows. In general, this research explains the macroeconomic factors that determine FDI flows from multinational enterprises (MNEs). Sethi et al. found that there are always both push and pull factors affecting FDI. Push factors include low-cost and efficiency seeking, competition from other firms to enter the emerging market (bandwagon effect), reduction transportation cost, while pull factors would be low wages, local government regulation of investment, liberalization, and domestic reform. Their study found that since the 1980s, and intensively increasing in the 1990s, local governments in Asia have attempted to attract FDI by promoting \"investor-friendly\" policies. Further, these local governments are expected to guarantee certain aspects such as a stable political environment, stable exchange rates, regulation consistency, and sound infrastructure. At the firm level, these factors focus on project incentives, process of regional economic integration. The FDI flowed from developed to developing countries as an economic expansion of the developed countries. Developed countries considered their decision on FDI based on a regional appraisal rather than a single-country basis. They implemented cluster analysis at regional level given that the economic gravity in the region is the country with the largest share of intra-regional trade or regional FDI. It adopted relative number in percentage rather than volume to avoid bias assessment. Their research adopted cross-section analysis and took two different years, 1985 and 1995. They found that intra-regional trade shows more convergence than FDI patterns. The pattern of trade is more regionalized while that of investment is more internationalized.",

They used binomial logit models and found that investment behavior depends on the rivalry action of a competitor. This is similar to the theory of oligopolistic reaction that strategic behavior of one actor depends on the presence of its competitor. In previous studies, classical economics argues that profit in an oligopolistic market would increase if the firms choose to have cooperative policies. Oligopolistic reaction is also known as followthe-leader behavior or bandwagon effect in trade. A similar argument to oligopolistic reaction applies to investment decisions. A firm would less likely invest in a country where its rivals are already trading because they would avoid going head-to-head since competition always reduces profit. For that reason, oligopolistic reaction is not a risk-taker strategy. Other arguments suggest that a firm would still invest in markets already controlled by their rivals but only to show that it exists. Remembering that the international market consists of several markets, also known as multimarket competition, then in some markets it most likely that one rival controls the market while in other markets another rival is in control. The first-mover would control the market and the following firm would need to adjust its investments in order to keep common profits high. There are five major players in the tire industry: Japan (Bridgestone which acquired Firestone), USA (Goodyear), Italy (Pirelli), France (Michelin which acquired Uniroyal and Goodrich), and Germany (Continental). Ito and Rose's research assumes that competition in the market depends on the number of firms involved in the market itself.",

This result requires a perfect-information assumption and found that the current multimarket competition theory challenges classical economic oligopolistic theory because the lack of trust between firms would in the end trap them into a prisoner's dilemma to compete with each other.",

Foster adopted a primary data method by sending postal questionnaires to respondents followed by eight detailed interviews. The response rate of the postal questionnaires was 40 percent which is sufficient for a postal method. The fully completed and correct responses were then followed by interviews with managers or senior planners. This research found that in terms of financial indicators, the most essential ones are NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) of the FDI.",

They covered three regional economic organizations: NAFTA, ASEAN, and the EU, and found that incentives for FDI inflows are not only affected by the elimination of trade barriers (tariff and non-tariff) in the region but also by country size. An increase in FDI in the region by external firms would increase production competitiveness in the region. At the country level, an increasing FDI is seen as a good sign from the government's point of view but it does not necessarily mean that local firms share the same view. In the long run, high levels of FDI make the host country dependent on foreign countries. FDI inflows would benefit local consumers (and workers) at the cost of the host country's local producers while imposing costs on the home country's consumers (and workers or hollowing-out) though benefiting home-country investors. They also found that local producers who are not able to compete with foreign investors would have the incentive to switch their investments either by becoming traders or investing in other countries. They found that intra-regional trade significantly determines intra industry trade. P. J. Buckley (1993) explains the factors that determine FDI inflows in a particular location.

He argues that both macroeconomic and microeconomic approaches are needed when analyzing FDI flows. In sum, his research discusses general factors from domestic factors, oligopoly strategies between multinational firms, and the role of local government in attracting FDI inflows. P. Lin and K. Saggi (1999) show that the independent variables that significantly affect FDI are illegal imitating action against Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). FDI flows have become more flexible and mobile since the 1980s, when foreign investment had been a global trend for national policy liberalization. Since that period, the issue of local imitation versus FDI investors who own original products has increased and has currently turned into a global issue concerning the importance of IPRs especially for FDI investors.",

First on negative externality from \"local imitation,\" in particular massive production by newly liberalizing countries such as China and Russia and the second on the positive externality of long-term learning from \"local imitation\" cases that generated the rule of IPRs. This study took local imitation as a negative externality and adopted a dynamic model of non-cooperative action between the leader of FDI (the first firm to invest with FDI) and the follower of FDI (the second firm to invest with FDI) to show its positive externality (from the leader to the follower). If negative externality is greater than positive externality the follower of FDI will shift its type of investment from direct investment to licensing. Yet these followers would not choose to remain as exporters because the investment payoff benefit is always higher than staying as a trader. This would extend the \"grace period\" for the follower to switch its investments to FDI. This lag time depends on how fast local imitation occurs.",

Even though local imitation increases competition between the local firm and leader of FDI as a negative externality it also could decrease competition among FDI investors. If competition between FDI investors is tighter, then local imitation is preferred by the FDI leader since it extends the delay time of the FDI follower. This is known as the \"indirect benefit\" from local imitation. This provides incentives to be the FDI leader instead of the follower (first mover advantage). For the follower, the delay time is not only affected by the local imitation adjusting time but also by the level of competition. In this case even if local firms could immediately imitate the FDI leader, if the quality of product does not meet consumers' demand and taste then the follower would have a high incentive to switch to FDI. This will make competition tighter since it involves both multinational competitor (FDI follower) and local firm (local imitator). In regards to the \"first mover advantage\" of the FDI leader, they found that the local imitation cost was higher for the follower than the leader. In general, if a local customer is less likely to switch their taste to alternative sellers then being the FDI leader is more beneficial than being an FDI follower. R. Rob and N. Vettas (2003) found that the independent variable that significantly affects FDI is trade competitiveness. They took geographic aspects on production networks as an essential factor before a firm decides to invest in direct investment. Similar to Ping and Saggi's study, Rob and Vettas also argue that FDI generates low marginal cost compared to exporting. They argue that the FDI host firm has exported to the home country before the firm switched to become an FDI investor. The firm needs to switch from being an exporter to an investor particularly because the demand for its products from home or importing country has increased over time. This explains the trade-led investment phenomenon, also known as \"from trade relation to investment creation.\" The motivation for FDI depends on savings on variable costs such as lower transportation cost, insurance cost, tariff, tax and labor cost, and entry cost. The entry cost is a sunk cost because FDI generates irreversible cost once the firm decides to invest. If the saving from variable costs is higher than entry costs then a firm is better off investing in FDI and it would be better to export when the opposite occurs. FDI inflows continuously increase as long as demand (domestic and global) increases. If exports increase as well as FDI inflows then both have complementary relations, and if the opposite occurs then both have a substitution relation.",

If saving cost is higher than entry cost then investors will decide to invest in FDI or switch from seller to investor. Another basic difference between Ping and Saggi and Rob and Vettas is in the methodology. Ping and Saggi took dynamic and complete information while Rob and Vettas adopted dynamic and incomplete information as the basic assumption for their FDI flows model on pre-entry of investment inflows (before an investor invests in FDI or a seller switches from exporter to investor). R. Barrell and N.

In this article Barrell and Pain focus on US companies' FDI.

Kobrin took a sample of 59 developing countries with multiple cross-section regression analyses on industrialization, social change, and FDI.

These observed countries were limited to those having a minimum of one million population and US$ 500 Million GNP. This finding was consistent with the \"theory of underdevelopment,\" which explains that developing countries depend on developed countries in regards to economic, technological, and cultural factors.

His research found that multinational corporations (MNCs) with their monopoly power in terms of non-pricing strategy such as promotion, competition, and technology entered the foreign market and increased competition in the FDI host's local market as well as the global market as it made overseas countries alternative production bases. Yet at the beginning, MNCs faced asymmetric information about the host country such as consumer tastes, local customs, and discriminative conduct by the host government, laws and business practices, and so on. This made start-up costs very high at the launch but these decreased over time. This research found that FDI has always consisted of principal firms in the home country and branch firm(s) in the host country: this format is commonly known as the \"subsidiary form.\" The form consists of two types: licensing from a headquarter in the home country of FDI for local producers in the FDI host country to produce the products (known as \"arm's-length licensing\"); and establishment of a foreign subsidiary. The balance between start-up costs from asymmetric information about the local host country and transaction costs from adjustment-time, decides whether an MNC prefers to license or enter a joint venture with local producers.",

This means FDI generated positive spillover effect in enhancing the host country's level of development. This research found positive and significant relationships between concentration as oligopoly indicator and the extension of production as an FDI approach and between technological and management skills and FDI incentives.

Walz developed two functions: real and financial sector functions. He formulated two real sector models: production and consumption. In the production function he defined skilled labor as mobile labor and unskilled labor as immobile. In the consumption function Walz formulated a utility function and consumption from quality and consumption level function. All of these functions were disaggregated by different industry and country. For the financial model, he defined financial as a mobile factor.

His research found that tax reduction and liberalization of FDI would increase growth of FDI inflows and then they would increase R&D and technology transfer in the host country. Decreasing barriers to entry for FDI would decrease start-up costs and lead to a lower sunk cost of FDI. This would make the country more attractive for FDI investors. Walz argued that the easing of migration barriers generated similar impacts on FDI liberalization, that is, decreasing costs. He argued that relaxing immigration would decrease the cost of labor, which made him appear pro-immigrant workers. On the production side, he argued that subsidies for R&D, selected subsidies for producers, and tighter IPRs would increase FDI motives.

In general, this research focuses on the relationship between FDI and economic growth yet it explains detailed factors between them. This research database was taken from Canada's industry-level data. This research found that the role of FDI inflows and outflows had increased in developed countries for 10 years from 1990 to 1999. In 1990, the share of FDI inflows and the outflows of GDP of developed countries were 4.7 percent and 6.4 percent respectively while in 1999, they increased up to 14.5 percent and 19 percent respectively. Hejazi and Pauly in this research described three essential factors that affect FDI flows in host countries: market access, factor endowment differences, and access to natural resources. They found that FDI inflows also generated positive impacts for the host country's domestic economy. From a market-access aspect, inflows stimulated local intra-firm linkages as foreign investors require local intermediate inputs. This, in turn, stimulated export opportunities for local firms. As from factor endowment, motives to invest were influenced by low-cost production and employment creation in the host country. From a natural resources access standpoint, FDI inflows stimulate utilization of natural resources and can make local firms start caring about their own natural resources. From its general models, this research took several variables that hypothetically affect FDI and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). The variables are corporate profits, corporate taxes, price indices for intermediate inputs, and price indices for labor input (wages), interest rates, capital stocks, and R&D spending.",

The majority of home country of FDI (inflows) among the member states are Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Plummer and Cheong explained that the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is the phase of regional economic integration in ASEAN to enhance trade liberalization and investment creation (FDI inflows), and this is important for a further phase of free flows of capital and people. Therefore, an important goal of the AEC is to attract FDI. Complete tariff reduction (CEPT 0 percent) in 2015 is designed to achieve this important goal. ASEAN implemented several kinds of regional level agreement such as the ASEAN Industrial Project (AIP), ASEAN Industrial Complementary (AIC), ASEAN Industrial Joint Ventures (AIJV), ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO), and, the most important one, ASEAN Investment Area in 1998 which come into force in 1999.",

The ASEAN Secretariat simulation with Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) found that ACFTA will increase both intra-regional trade and regional FDI inflows. From intra-regional trade, ASEAN exports to China will increase around 48 percent while China's export to ASEAN will increase about 55.1 percent. Following the increase in intra-regional trade, China's FDI in Southeast Asia will also increase to expand her market in ASEAN and to make ASEAN a production base for China's industrial networks. This reminds us of Japan's Regional Production Network in Southeast Asia established around 40 years ago.",

RPN was originally designed by Japanese investors to meet minimum cost of production at its regional level in Southeast Asia. Japan adopts a production network to achieve an increasing return to scale condition while producing input of a single output. Regarding the principle of the international economies of scale, Japanese investors find that each member state of ASEAN has its own comparative advantage in producing components. Japanese investors allocate their FDI in different countries depending on the countries' different increasing return to scale in producing each component. Japan played as the home country of FDI and Southeast Asian countries played as host countries of FDI. Both home and host country have benefited from this production network. The home country reduced its production cost and increased its productivity while the host country increased its employment and received wages. The RPN increased the bargaining position of investors in the world while the host country could learn from the home country and join with its international production and trade network. The RPN was the original source of the regionalism that increased trade and investment relationships in Southeast Asia. The success story of RPN is the basic proposition for this study to argue that the ASEAN-PLUS framework is the most suitable way for ASEAN to enhance its trade and investment relationship. This will be the best alternative to fill the absence of a custom union in Southeast Asia, which, in other words, is ASEAN-PLUS as the means for ASEAN to enter the ASEAN Economic Community or Custom Union in 2016.",

Each country represents a single firm with n domestic market and n-1 export market.

They found that the effects of GDP and Population to Bilateral FDI inflows to host countries are positive while distance is negative (i.e., >3,300 km), which means the classical hypotheses are proven. They found CPI effect to Bilateral FDI inflows to host countries to be positive, which means the more accountable the host country's government the more attractive the host country is for the external FDI investors.

This meeting recommended ASEAN to first introduce two most important factors of economic regional integration: PTA (Preferential Trade Agreement) which become the basis of her AFTA and ASEAN Industrial Projects (AIPs) with two schemes: ASEAN Industrial Complementation Scheme and ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture Scheme.

(2) Shifting interest of private business sector to enlarge their market into regional level. (3) Increasing concern about ASEAN's identity after the end of the Cold War in 1989. Identity is a factor that economists rarely use but in this field this factor needs to be observed in order to understand the complete process of regional economic integration. The Philippines proposed CU for ASEAN economic integration instead of AFTA during the 1986 Manila Summit, but this proposal was rejected by Singapore because it did not want to increase its external tariff due to its unilateral trade liberalization. As is known, CU imposes common external tariffs from member states to non-member states. Indonesia had a greater preference for AFTA rather than CU because of (1) ASEAN's intra-regional trade was insufficient to become a CU, and (2) the difficulties of arranging harmonization of customs administration. They showed that the most successful example of a CU was the European Common Market of 1957. Another was Zollverein, which was established in 1834 by a large number of sovereign German states (Salvatore 2004). A Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) is a discriminatory trade policy for non-members that can be divided into RTA (Regional Trade Agreements) based on geographic proximity and BTA (Bilateral Trade Agreement) or BFTA (Bilateral Free Trade Agreement) based on common interests regardless of geographic proximity. RTA can be divided into two forms: FTA which regulates internal tariff among members but does not regulate external tariff between members and nonmembers and CU which regulates external tariff between members and non-members.",

AFTA represents a progressive institutional development of ASEAN economic integration with its \"inter-governmental\" mechanism. There are several progressive CEPT mechanisms such as: Rules of Origin to prevent re-export that is in line with tariff deflection and details on Operational Procedures. AFTA became legal-binding for signatories. She argues ASEAN with its ASEAN Way also adopts \"soft-regionalism\" for its AFTA by implementing flexibility for exceptions without penalty and executing CEPT based on the lowest common denominator on its internal tariff harmonization. AFTA is considered as non-binding and non-punitive in mitigating potential conflict within members. ASEAN provides room for flexibility for excluding particular products as temporary lists by concerned members. For instance, Malaysia with her national automotive industry. Thailand with her petrochemical industry, Philippines which signed CEPT at a lower tariff level over textiles, and the iron and steel industry, and Indonesia over its strategic national industries.",

Economic motives come from a \"market sharing\" function that is partly demand driven (consumer surplus) and partly supply driven (regional winning producer surplus versus local firms-losing trade creation and non-member firms-losing trade diversion). This economic motive emerged as AFTA. Another economic motive in Southeast Asia regional cooperation is a \"resources-pooling strategy\" (RPS). It is similar to the EU's experience on common resource management of coal and steel (ECSC). RPS is driven by the producer's interest in controlling the production side of a particular commodity. It is an oligopoly-type market. RPS in Southeast Asia was implemented by some limited members of ASEAN, and is called a sub-regional cooperation. Regional stability is driven by threat factors. These threat factors can be classified into two: inter-country and domestic problems. 11 Interstate threats have two types: (1) Traditional threats such as (a) the spread of communism, which affects the old conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia in 1960s, Indonesia and East Timor during the Cold War in the 1970s, (b) territorial disputes between neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Philippines on East Sabah, Malaysia, and Singapore on Batu Puteh, Malaysia, and Indonesia on Amabalat Block; (2) Non-traditional threats such as (a) regional terrorism network, (b) transnational crimes, (c) pandemic problem such as SARS, H5N1-Influenza virus, H1N1-Swine virus, (d) regional environment disaster such as haze pollution, (e) arts and culture over claimed,(f ) illegal immigrant workers, (g) smuggling products such as oil, illegal trading due to world oil-price hikes, re-selling exploitation due to trade deflection, etc.",

These costs consist of both administrative costs (COO certificate) and opportunity costs (substitution incentive to export and import from host countries). It is very common for the host country in ASEAN to provide trade incentives such as low import tariff to stimulate FDI. Foreign investors will enjoy such tariff incentives if they invest in the host country or if they import inputs for manufacturing purposes for both objectives: to export or to fulfill domestic market demand. The benefit of using FTA is simply the difference between its MFN and CEPT tariffs. This research by Hayakawa et al. assumes that the more diversified the origin of a firm's procurement, the higher their output volumes and exports are the larger the difference in the operating profit between FTA rates and general rates (p. 10). In other words, this indicates that firms with many connections in ASEAN are more willing to utilize AFTA tariff facilities since its potential benefit is high. If cost and opportunity cost of using FTA are higher than its benefit, then the utilization of FTA will decrease. In particular, for AFTA, the utilization rate of export to total export (intra trade) is only around 15-20 percent (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) while the ratio of import to total import (intra trade) is only 11-16 percent (Hiratsuka et al., p. 2) .",

He added that CM opens the important role of TFP to economic integration. This is because CM provides a bigger market than just trade of goods to investment movement from local to regional space. The bigger the market, the freer the flows of goods, capital, and people, then the higher productivity and incentives to compete. He defined CM as a dynamic form of regional integration. At this point Balassa discussed that economies of scale is equal to the size of the market. Joining regional economic integration will increase economies of scale of any country. Regional economic integration opens the opportunities for investment, specialization, technology, and know-how transfer, which in turn will increase the competitiveness of a country. On economic union, Balassa explained that harmonization of national policies into a united regional policy is important. This covers various policies such as monetary, fiscal, social, and counter-cyclical. Harmonization will generate economic efficiency and capacity to adjust any economic gaps among the member states. Balassa argues that a free flow of capital regime must be completed with a fixed exchange rate policy.

This will also be a battle training ground for the members before they compete in more liberalized markets at global level. Governments have to harmonize regional interests into domestic benefit for both local firms and consumers.",

In contrast, economists believe that economic liberalization is better if it has been achieved through a non-discriminatory base at which welfare optimization will occur. Lawrence implements two main reasons for regional economic integration: (1) lobbying from various interest groups for their own benefit, not for the whole economic welfare; and (2) no other alternative because non-discriminatory economic liberalization faces huge barriers of asymmetric information, global uncertainty, oligopolist markets, and imperfect labor and capital mobility. He found that the multilateral economic liberalization of the WTO is the best way to maximize total economic welfare, but the multilateral organization does not satisfy enough, in particular failing to accommodate what he calls \"deeper integration.\" Therefore, under these unfortunate circumstances discriminative economic liberalization at regional level is the most suitable way. This makes the current motivation of regionalism to be different from that in the early years after the end of World War II. Recently, regionalism is part of a cautious economic liberalization towards world asymmetric information and global uncertainty.",

Therefore, regionalism becomes a deeper economic integration than multilateralism because the multilateral organization of the WTO does not handle production networks issues.

Yet he argues that a country's decision to join or not to join depends on domestic factors such as local private sector lobbying, the domestic trade regime, and national policy makers rather than international pressures.

The AFAS was signed at the fifth ASEAN Summit in Bangkok by the ASEAN Economic Ministers. As a regional economic organization with discriminative interests, the AFAS focuses on market access and national treatment instead of MFN and transparency. ASEAN has officially stated that AFAS is consistent with GATS and is designed to complement it, ASEAN even titled it GATS Plus. On September 2, 2003, the AFAS applied the \"ASEAN Minus X\" principle by which service liberalization does not require all members to be ready. This means those members who are ready to liberalize trade in their service sector will not need to wait for other members that are not yet ready. This makes AFAS different from the ASEAN-PLUS model because the latter requires a complete commitment from all members before applying liberalization to trade in goods. Each member offers different service sub-sectors to be liberalized depending on its readiness. In February 2009 Indonesia, for instance, offered 68 service sub-sectors. The ASEAN Economic Community in 2016 is a sign of this achievement. This will increase direct investment flows in Southeast Asia, a free flow of capital that needs to be followed by service-sector liberalization. This is why the AFAS prioritized trade in service liberalization on financial services, transportation and logistics services, and presence of natural persons. These priorities can be seen in the official progress report by the ASEAN Finance Ministers and ASEAN Transport Ministers on the AFAS commitment packages. In addition to that, ASEAN has also achieved Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) to facilitate easier movement for professionals such as Engineering services (signed on The EU completed its economic community within 20 years from 1967 to 1987 and took only ten years to complete the FTA. If ASEAN needed around 23 years to complete the ASEAN FTA from 1992 to 2015, then roughly estimated it needs at least 45 years to complete its economic community before it achieves a common market. Moving to financial integration such as single monetary union and single currency is an option but changing the economic community into a common market is a natural process. This needs trade-related service liberalization, service-sector liberalization, commercial presence of open market access, and natural person presence of non-discriminatory national treatment. Given this, the economic community according to the EU's experience is the longest process in the regional economic integration. ASEAN needs to be consistent and persistent.",

For example, consider the commitment to a preferential trade arrangement (PTA) in 1977 when its implementation (AFTA) was only signed in 1992. An even longer duration has taken place for the AIPs that was also committed to in 1977 yet its implementation (AICO) is still yet to take place.

There will no longer be central banks at country level but instead a regional central bank with branches in each member. There will be two arguments about the independence of the central bank. The independent central bank means autonomy from politicians such as house of representatives, parliaments, or government yet central banks are still related with each other through the establishment of a single central bank with different branches in each member state. Once a PU can achieve a common agreement on both monetary and fiscal issues then the single central bank can be established and followed by the ultimate step of an economic regional integration: the single currency (SC). Based on the experience of the EU, once a single currency is achieved the region still needs to manage monetary policy as well as its harmonization with disciplined fiscal policy.

The selected year birth of the EU is 1957 because this was the year its first PTA (FTA) was established. Yet the Treaty of Paris is considered as a forerunner institution for the EU. Ten years after EU established its first regional economic commitment, it reached a new agreement called the European Economic Community (EEC). If the Treaty of Rome in 1957 covered commitments on FTA, the EEC covered commitments on CU. At this level the EU achieved regional economic integration in trade and investment relations. It took around 20 years for the EU to achieve the next level known as the European Single Market (ESM). This covers the regional commitment on CM. Since the Bretton Woods agreement on international fixed exchange rate of international currency (US$) collapsed in 1971-1973, the EU had started its commitment to financial integration, but in reality it needed 20 years after achieving CM to establish the SMU and SC. However, monetary regional integration has made the EU formulate a new treaty called the Treaty of Maastricht, in 1993, because not all of the members were willing to join to establish the SMU and SC.

There are several factors that contribute to this: (1) there is always a production network in producing export products. Naturally each country has distinct advantages in raw materials, economies of scale, and specialization in production. All countries need to work together; (2) developed countries have an incentive to remove some of their component production to developing countries. This will reduce the production cost in developed countries and create jobs in developing countries. This type of win-win solution connects developed and developing countries under trade and investment relations; (3) real sector activities such as export and import have strong relationships with the financial sector because one of the functions of money is as a medium of exchange. In international transactions, the currency used for payments is the developed country's currency. This makes developing countries take money as a store of value function in their international reserves in the developed country's currency such as US$, Euro, and Yen. This is why every time developed countries such as the USA and Europe face economic trouble that affects their currency, the local currency of developing countries will also be affected. At the same time, normally in the short run, there are disturbances on derivatives markets such as stocks, obligation, and gold prices, and in the medium run there are pressures on inflation rates as well as domestic interest rates in both developed and developing countries.",

MFSO is responsible for implementing surveillance and monitoring the consistency of the commitment for regional integration in ASEAN particularly as related to financial integration. The roadmap for monetary and financial integration consists of four areas of financial integration which had been selected in 2003 during the AFMM in Manila: (1) Capital Market Development, including bond market development; (2) Financial Services Liberalization. This is related to ASEAN's financial service liberalization commitment in 2015; (3) Capital Account Liberalization, which attempts to achieve free-flows of capital, particularly FDI flows; and (4) Currency Cooperation, through an enhancement of intra-trade and investment relations with closer currency cooperation under macroeconomic convergence.",

The multilateral cooperation is supported by all the member states of APT at which small countries can borrow up to five times of their contribution while big countries such as PRC and Japan were limited up to 50 percent of their contributions. This stimulates big support from small countries. Another interesting point is that the reserve of CMIM still very small compared to the sum of its members' international reserve (2.5 percent).

Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows. 6. Percentage of Economic Growth (GR). This variable represents \"economic performance.\" According to theory, economic growth is a positive indicator for investors to invest in long-run investment or FDI inflows (Salvatore 2004). GDP has two types, nominal GDP and real GDP. Nominal GDP includes inflation rate (current price) while real GDP covers only constant prices that exclude the inflation rate. In measuring the economic growth, economists adopt real GDP as it represents growth of output and requires constant price. Economists use rate of economic growth as a proxy to review economic condition whether a country is in expansion, crises, recession, or in depression.

This represents the availability of productive production input of labor (L). Labor is an important input factor beside capital and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). In a macroeconomics perspective, population is divided into work force and non-work force (Blanchard 2009). Work forces are population who are in their productive age (around 15-65 years old) and non-work forces are those who are out of this age range. Work forces are divided into labor forces and non-labor forces. Labor forces are work forces who are employed or seeking jobs. Non-labor forces are labor forces who are considered not as working such as housewives and students. This study uses number of employed workers as a proxy for employed labor force. This number represents productive production input. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows. 9. Government Expenditure on Education (EDU). This variable is a proxy for human resource quality. This variable is to substitute unavailable data in R&D expenditure by country. Data of total spending on R&D in the observed countries cannot fulfill the timeseries need.

Exchange Rate (ER). This variable is taken from the average exchange rate (domestic currency per US$). This variable represents economic stability. During Southeast Asia's economic crises, exchange rates incurred an unanticipated depreciation leading to devaluation. Hayakawa and Kimura's (2008) study found that exchange rates were the most important variable to describe economic uncertainty and competitiveness within production blocs in regional production networks. Exchange rate also represents a cost-of-service link. This means that a country with high volatility exchange rate will be difficult to incorporate with other countries in a production network as its exchange rate volatility endangers the entire network. Jones and Kierzkowski's (1990) study introduced the basic concept of the fragmentation between \"before\" (large integrated factory) and \"after\" fragmentation (several production blocs (PB) being connected to each other with service links (SL)). Fragmentation of PB and SL makes the costs of transportation (logistic cost, insurance cost, trade cost, quality of infrastructure); administrative costs (custom clearance, loading-unloading, COO Certificate) important to evaluate the effectiveness of regional integration process. Kiyota and Urata's (2004) study shows that exchange rate volatility has significant negative impact on Japanese FDI inflows in East Asian countries. According to the relative-value-of-wealth approach, the more depreciated a local currency of a host (developing) country, the more is the incentive for the investor in the home (developed) country to invest. Given that this study uses nominal exchange rates as local home currency per local host currency; therefore, the increasing ER generates disincentive for the investors to invest FDI inflows in host country. The data is collected from the Global Development Finance. The World Bank defines this as \"payments of direct investment income (debit side) which consist of income on equity (dividends, branch profits, and reinvested earnings) and income on the intercompany debt (interest).\" The data are part of Resource Flows at which the set form is on a yearly basis. This study adopts this data as a proxy for the profit advantage of the observed countries. This means that the higher profit remittance from FDI the higher value added of physical investment, then the more attractive that country is for investors. Hypotheses are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows. 14. Real Wage (RW). This is an approach to productivity of labor. It is based on the basic formula: P = W/MPL; P is price level; W is nominal wage; MPL is marginal productivity of labor. Therefore, productivity is MPL = W/P; In order to get general representative number of productivity, this study calculates MPL through the calculation of W/P. This is represented by the ratio of GDP per employment. This figure is obtained by dividing the value of GDP to the number of employment. Thus this number is divided by CPI (Consumer Price Index) in order to get the productivity value. Hypothesis are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows. 15. Intra-Regional Trade (INTRA). This variable is treated as the dependent variable when testing the impact of AFTA to trade creation (intra-regional trade) of ASEAN. This study also uses INTRA as an independent variable when testing the relationship between trade creation and investment creation (FDI inflows). A previous study by Verico (2007) found that Intra ASEAN Trade affects FDI inflows in Southeast Asia. This study showed that the indicator of I is the most relevant indicator to calculate intra-trade in Southeast Asia. The formula is adopted from Frankel (1997) and is explained as follows: is one of the largest destination markets, and (b) Mexico is one of the largest competitors for ASEAN products. AFTA represents progressive institutional development of ASEAN economic integration with its \"inter-governmental\" mechanism to increase intra-regional trading in Southeast Asia. For this purposes AFTA became legally binding for signatories (Nesadurai 2003) . AFTA was discussed officially in 1992 and signed the year after. AFTA Dummy represents regional trade cooperation among ASEAN members. 17 Malaysia adopted AFTA CEPT by reducing its tariff in 1992 but Philippines did it in 1997, while the initiator of AFTA (Thailand) and CEPT designer (Indonesia) did it in 1998. This dummy uses 1999 as an anchor, therefore years after 1999 is 1 and years before 1999 is 0. AFTA was officially signed in 1992 but implementation took several years and the data sent signals that the most appropriate break point for Other variables such as corruption index, political stability, distance, English speaking capacity are not observed due to limited data availability or irrelevancy to the study's hypothesis. Selected variables, their expected signs of hypothesis, and sources of data for systems equation to prove the relationship between AFTA, intra-regional trade, and FDI inflows are described in Table 2 .1 (Appendix). This following table consists of total variables that will be utilized in order to find the most significant variables which affect FDI inflows.",

It runs equation one and equation two under one system that has unrelated errors (SURE). The impact of AFTA on FDI inflows as explained above are seen from two ways: first is the \"direct impact\" of AFTA to FDI inflows and second is the \"indirect impact\" in which AFTA first affects intra-regional trade then second its intra-regional trade affects FDI inflows.

From the trade creation side, variables that significantly influence intra-regional trade in the SURE model are economic size (Log GDP), number of employment (Log Employ), purchasing power (Log GNP/Cap), electricity capacity (Log Electricity), degree of openness (DOO), and AFTA. Both signs of these variables and their significance level to the intra-regional trade are similar between SURE and SEME. Economic size of Log GDP and electricity capacity as the representative of sound infrastructure significantly and positively stimulate intra-regional trade within member states. On the other hand, number of employment, purchasing power (GNP per Capita), and degree of openness show the opposite result, which negatively affects intra-regional trade. As for employment, the reason behind this is similar to the finding in the non-system equation that intra-regional trade capacity does not increase because of employment increases but competitiveness and productivity of labor. As for the purchasing power and degree of openness, it is indicated that the more they increase, the higher incentive for ASEAN members to have trade relations of export and import with non-member states rather than with member states. AFTA gives positive impact to intra-regional trade but is still insignificant. This indicates that ASEAN needs to enhance the impact of its regional trade arrangement on its intra-regional trade. In SEME model, this study finds that FDI inflows positively influence intra-regional trade but still insignificantly. Similar to its AFTA impact, ASEAN also needs to enhance the impact of its FDI inflows to its intra-regional trade.",

One independent variable of number of employment (Log Employ) is significant and positive in affecting FDI inflows but only in the simultaneous model. Consumption capacity is significant and positive in stimulating investment creation (FDI inflows) in the observed members. This indicates that investors consider an increase in consumption as an incentive for them to increase investment. Number of population is inconclusive as it has different impacts-positive to FDI inflows in SEME and negative in SURE. Similar to the sign of the variable in intraregional trade, an increase in purchasing power of GNP/Cap create disincentives for the investor to invest. This indicates that increasing GNP/ Cap increases trade incentive of export and import and decreases the incentive to invest. Lastly, intra-regional trade is negative to FDI inflows. Even its power is still insignificant but it is important to pay attention to the potential negative relationship between trade creation and investment creation in ASEAN, since it can come to be a barrier for ASEAN in its attempt to move from intra-regional trade to intra-regional investment in the ASEAN Economic Community. This indicates that ASEAN needs other regional economic integration frameworks to complete the AFTA to positively connect ASEAN intra-trade and ASEAN intra-investment.",

This study found that ASEAN has a discriminative investment policy towards investors from non-member states. AFTA adopted regional affirmative action towards investors from member states and non-member states. This has been proven in the history of ASEAN particularly in relation to the regional economic policy of investment policies such as the ASEAN Industrial Project (AIP), ASEAN Industrial Complementary (AIC), ASEAN Industrial Joint Ventures (AIJV), ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) and the most recent was the implementation of ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) in 1998, which came into force in 1999. These policies give more privileges to investors from member states than those from non-member states. Yet these discriminative investment policies could lead to a decline in FDI inflows. According to Kindleberger (1966) this phenomenon is called \"trade substitute FDI inflows.\" Inter-regional economic cooperation between ASEAN and East Asian countries will generate more \"trade creation\" than \"trade diversion.\" 19 This enlargement is a natural process that will generate economic impacts on \"investment creation.\" If trade diversion effect is higher than the trade creation effect, domestic supports from local firms are easier to be achieved, but in the opposite circumstances, domestic opposition will increase. This is a kind of short-run challenge in establishing ASEAN economic cooperation with domestic support from central government, local government, and local firms. The enlargement of ASEAN throughout the ASEAN-Plus framework will generate two other major benefits: to enhance trade and investment integration in Southeast Asia and to improve the bargaining position over the external threats of global economic imbalances. This chapter confirmed the impact of intra-regional trade (trade creation and trade diversion) and FDI inflows (vertical and horizontal) in Southeast Asian countries particularly among the observed countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Philippines. All estimators confirm that the trade-investment relationship does not exist between AFTA and investment creation. Most studies on investment perception show that investors are seeking internal factors related to doing business such as procedures required to start a business, profit tax, number of documents to export and import, and ease of doing business, rather than the existence of the region's FTAs.",

Several variables show significant and negative impact on intra-regional trade. They are economic size (Log GDP), purchasing power (Log GNP per capita), and degree of openness (DOO). These indicate that the higher the economic size, the stronger the purchasing power, and the more open economic relation of ASEAN, the more incentive for the member states to enhance economic relations with non-members. This will increase inter-economic relations rather than intra-regional trade in ASEAN. Both the non-system and system equations show that AFTA positively affects intra-regional trade yet it is still insignificant; therefore, ASEAN needs to enhance its AFTA regional economic cooperation. In system equation, number of employment (Log Employ) is significant and negative to intra-regional trade. In relation to significant and positive impact of labor productivity (Log RW) to intra-regional trade in non-system equation, ASEAN needs labor productivity rather than increasing numbers in employment.

At the global level, there was the multilateral trade agreement GATT prior to WTO while at the same time many trade discrimination agreements have been concluded on the basis of the geographic proximity of members, such as the EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and AFTA. These regional agreements create a set of mixed and complicated trade agreements globally. This term was adopted from the description of a complicated system of interchange rapid in Los Angeles. This term was first adapted to describe complicated conditions in various levels of trade when a scholar, Michael Stutchbury assessed NAFTA as a discriminating regional trade agreement vis-a-vis the principle of \"open regionalism\" (Stutchbury 1994, 'Taste Test for APEC as Miami Serves Spaghetti', Australian Financial Review, p. 27). 21.

They are:X r,r is value of export (country based) from region to region M r,r is value of import (country based) from region to region X r,w is value of export from region to world M r,w is value of import of region from the world X r,r is value of export (country based) from region to region M r,r is value of import (country based) from region to regionUsing the Granger-Causality Test, the most significant formula is I rr . the basic theory for intra-regional trade and its effect on investment inflows is the \"Custom Union (CU) Effect.\" This is adopted from the EU's empirical experience as CU generates \"tariff factories\" that make trade diversion of the regional economic integration to be higher than its trade creation effect. This condition will stimulate \"investment creation\" from non-members. This study also assumes that AFTA stimulates FDI inflows from non-member states but less than the CU's impact. The intra-regional trade variable in this study is intra-ASEAN trade of final products with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand as representative of ASEAN. This formula represents total value of X and M from ASEAN to ASEAN divided by total ASEAN to the rest of the world. In order to avoid a double counting effect, Indonesia has been selected as an anchor. Therefore, her exports and imports to ASEAN are maintained while Malaysia's exports and imports have to be deducted when calculating that of Indonesia and Thailand; and Thailand's exports and imports are excluded when calculating that of Indonesia and Malaysia. Otherwise, for instance, Indonesia's export to Malaysia will double-count Malaysia's import from Indonesia. The same method is also applied in calculating X and M values for the rest of the world. Source of Data: Direction of Trade by Destination Country in US$, ADB. This calculation is confirmed with Intra-Regional Trade Index of ARIC Data Base. The intra-trade is intra-ASEAN trade in these three observed countries in ASEAN. It has been formulated as follows:, , X r,r is value of export (country based) from region to region M r,r is value of import (country based) from region to region X r,w is value of export from region to world M r,w is value of import of region from the world Intra-regional trade data have been adopted from the author's previous study (Verico 2007) . 16 In order to get a comparative description, this study adopts the intra-regional trade (percent) of ASEAN from ARIC-ADB data of 2010 to compare with the author's calculation on Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Hypotheses for the intra-regional trade of ASEAN are (H0): Negative effect to FDI flows; (H1): Positive effect to FDI flows. 16. Dummy AFTA. In theory FTA is designed to generate trade creation within the region. Some scholars argue that AFTA establishment was because of: (a) the end of Cold War in 1989, (b) settlement of Cambodian conflict, (c) augmenting economic integration in the EU from common market to financial integration after signing the Maastricht Treaty, (d) opening free market access for Mexico in USA after NAFTA assignation. This harmed ASEAN in two ways: (a) the USA",
