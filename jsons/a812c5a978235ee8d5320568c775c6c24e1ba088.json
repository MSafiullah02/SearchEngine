After 25 years, its pathogenesis and, more important, its prevention remain unclear. In the literature on NEC, anecdotal reports unfortunately outnumber the rigorous epidemiologic studies by a ratio of at least 100 to 1. In the present publication, I discuss the epidemiology of NEC and overview its two main theories of pathogenesis: that of Santulli of New York (1) and that of Lawrence of Brisbane (2) , with mention of my own (imperfect) attempts at a unifying hypothesis to explain outlying clinical phenomena (3, 4) .",

It is a syndrome characterized by crepitant necrosis of the gut. Ninety percent of its victims are premature infants in the NICU, many of whom would have died in earlier times of respiratory complications. In the United States the incidence ranges from 1 to 3 cases per 1000 live births and 1-7.7% of NICU admissions. The mortality has been calculated at 13.1 deaths per 100000 live births, or 20-40% of cases (6) . Clinically, NEC is characterized by the triad of abdominal distension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumatosis intestinalis, i.e. air within the intestinal wall. In addition, infants with severe NEC may have air within the portal vein or pneumoperitoneum following intestinal perforation. In one study at the University of New Mexico, we correlated the roentgenographic findings with outcome of NEC, employing a grading system for the pneumatosis intestinalis as mild, moderate, or severe. The mortality was 18%, 21% and 62% respectively. The presence of portal venous gas at diagnosis of NEC was associated with a 65% mortality. Infants with a combination of severe pneumatosis and portal venous gas had the worst prognosis: a mortality of 86% (7) . The outcome of NEC was thus predicted by the initial findings on X-ray ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "Intestinal ischemic injury is the result of decreased perfusion. A variety of events, e.g., vasoconstriction, hypotension, low flow, or thrombosis, may initiate the process. Mucosal injury is widely attributed to \"the diving reflex\", a mechanism of selective circulatory ischemia which occurs in response to asphyxia. Classical studies were performed by Scholander, a Scandinavian physiologist, who measured the cardiovascular reflexes of diving mammals and birds (1 8) . His favorite experimental model was the laboratory seal, immersed in cool water. During a simulated dive, the seal's heart rate slowed from a normal of 80-90 beats/ min to 5-6 beats/min, with redistribution of blood flow to two organs: the heart and the brain. Peripheral arterial pressure decreased, and peripheral flow virtually ceased. When the seal surfaced, flow was restored to all the organs which had been ischemic, including the gut and the kidneys. Reactive hyperemia occurred. It is postulated that this reflex occurs in the premature infant whose gut is vulnerable to the ischemic insult, which initiates NEC. In 1969, Lloyd was the first to link the diving reflex to gastrointestinal perforations in the newborn, documenting a prior episode of asphyxia or shock in 80% of infants with perforations of the gastrointestinal tract (19) .",

Blanching or cyanosis of an infant's lower extremities is a frequent occurrence after advancement of the catheter tip into the abdominal aorta. Such blanching or cyanosis promptly resolves when the catheter is removed. Similar vasospastic phenomena may be inferred for the intestine, but may escape clinical detection unless NEC occurs. In a statistical study by Bunton and associates, catheterization of the umbilical artery was implicated as a predisposing factor for NEC (21), particularly with prolonged or complicated catheterization. Tyson and associates found severe catheter-related thromboatheromatous lesions at autopsy in 33 of 56 infants who had umbilical arterial catheters during life (22) . Although major thrombosis of mesenteric arteries is rarely documented in NEC (23), small emboli from indwelling aortic catheters remain a risk, especially when the catheter tip is positioned above the orifices of the mesenteric arteries (24) . Importance of catheter position remains controversial, however; an epidemiologic study by Kempley et al. of 308 infants whose umbilical arterial catheter had been randomly allocated to the \"high\" or \"low\" position showed no significant difference in risk of NEC between the two positions (1 1 cases of NEC in the \"high\" group; 9 in the \"low\" group) (25) . Venous thromboemboli in the portal system have been implicated in cases of neonatal colonic perforation after exchange transfusion via an umbilical venous catheter (12, 13, 26) . In some instances, hyperviscosity might initiate thrombosis Congenital heart disease is associated with NEC. Three logical mechanisms are invoked: (1) lowered perfusion pressure in lesions with left ventricular outflow obstruction, e.g., coarctation of the aorta, (2) \"diastolic steal\" from retrograde blood flow into the aorta, which has been documented during diastole in infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (28), or (3) intestinal injury from injection of hyperosmolar contrast media during cardiac catheterization (29) .

NEC is most likely to appear following quantitative extremes of these three elements, i.e. severe ischemia, highly pathogenic flora or a marked excess of substrate. NEC develops only if a threshold of injury sufficient to initiate intestinal necrosis is exceeded (3). The hypothesis was subsequently modified to consider the immunological immaturity of the premature gut (4). An experimental model was developed in germ-free and gnotobiotic rats for evaluation of the comparative effects of ischemia, bacteria, and substrate. In the pathogenesis of intestinal necrosis by this model, the most important of the three factors was bacteria (69) . A mathematical model for NEC was subsequently proposed in an attempt to describe the contribution of various pathogenetic factors to ischemic bowel mass and mortality (70) . years in the Journal of Pediatrics, published in St Louis, Missouri, USA. In Shimura's survey of 52 neontatal centers in Japan, only 89 cases of NEC were identified from 1985 to 1989 among 32 790 admissions of infants under 2500 g (0.3%) (71) . The Japanese incidence was thus 0.27%, i.e., 4 to 28 times lower than that reported for the United States (6) . In general, nations with low premature birth rates see very little NEC. Because epidemics of NEC occur, any epidemiologic investigations of NEC should employ simultaneous controls. Historical controls may yield deceptive data, i.e., an intervention which was introduced as an epidemic subsided could be credited with preventive powers, which, in fact, were false. And, sometimes, paradoxically, NEC seems to go away just as we are ready to begin the perfect prospective study in our nursery.",
