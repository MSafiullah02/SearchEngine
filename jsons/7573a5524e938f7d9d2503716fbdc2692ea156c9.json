            "text": "The fast spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has resulted in the emergence of several hot-spots around the world. Several of these are located in areas associated with high levels of air pollution. This study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. The results show that atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. The estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100 percent when pollution concentrations increase by 20 percent. The association between air pollution and case incidence is robust in the presence of data on health-related preconditions, proxies for symptom severity, and demographic control variables. The results are obtained with ground-measurements and satellite-derived measures of atmospheric particulate matter as well as COVID-19 data from alternative dates. The findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in COVID-19 incidence, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading.

A recent paper by van Doremalen et al. (2020) analyzed the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 and compared it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus (Wu et al., 2020a) . The study found that SARS-CoV-2 can survive up to three days on some surfaces, like plastic and steel, and that aerosol transmission is plausible since the virus can remain viable and infectious in the air for hours. These findings echo those of Chen et al. (2004) on environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-1, and are consistent with evidence for aerosol distribution of SARS-CoV-2 found by Guo et al. (2020) , but are inconsistent with the current WHO stance that SARS-CoV-2 is not transported by air. However, the possibility of airborne transmission would call for different mitigation efforts to prevent spreading and is thus an important area of study.",

First, there is a strong spatial correlation visible in all four countries, which is to be expected for a virus that spreads by human contact. It is intriguing, however, that the highest case density in the Netherlands is in Brabant, the southeastern part of the country, while major cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam are in the west part of the country where the case density is lower. While Brabant is not the most populous province, it accounts for the highest contribution to nation-wide industrial GDP. Within the province, the sub-region Zuidoost-Noord-Brabant produces the highest contribution to industrial GDP. 7 This area approximately spans the COVID-19 case cluster that can be seen on the map.

The fact that the infection started at different times in different areas together with the exponential and geographical nature of case spread, may lead to spurious associations between the spatial distribution of case hot-spots and pollution levels, particularly if the initial cases occurred in polluted regions by mere chance and then spread to nearby regions. 14 To account for the issue, spatial models include neighboring values of the dependent variable and/or residuals as additional variables. These spatial averages control for the clustering that results from geographical spillovers. 15 These models can be understood as spatial equivalents to the models that are commonly used to analyze time series in which observed values are in part explained by recent observations. While the household composition and population density terms capture more dense social links, the spatial regression components capture the likelihood of contact with infective subjects. In particular, within a hot-spot, neighboring areas have high numbers of cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and the spatial regression terms capture the increased likelihood of having contact with infective subjects within the region. The important empirical question that these models thus seek to answer is whether pollution and case incidence are associated after controlling for the geographical relationships in disease spread.",

This is a plausible result. To simplify the multidimensional relationship between case densities and social interaction, regressing single household shares on unmarried population shares shows that on average, a 1% increase in the first is associated with a 0.74 % increase in the latter, suggesting that on average the case densities increase when there are more households in an area.",

Combined, the regressions thus provide strong evidence that PM 2.5 plays a role in COVID-19 case incidence that cannot be attributed to demographics or health pre-conditions. In particular, the estimate of 10.84 in Model (2) suggests that, on average, cases per 100,000 inhabitants grow by approximately 21.68 \u223c 22 when concentrations increase from 10mcg/m3 to 12mcg/m3. This corresponds to slightly less than a 100% increase given that the average municipal case density in the data is 24.79 \u223c 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Note that the direct elasticity is lower in the spatial models (3-5), but the net impacts need to be multiplied by spatial spillover effects. Spatial spillovers \u03c1 and spatial correlation in the residuals \u03bb are both significant and have a positive sign highlighting that spatial spillovers further add to local effects. For example, evaluating the prediction difference of the spatial autoregressive model (4) at PM 2.5 levels of 10mcg/m3 and 12mcg/m3, suggests a very similar increase in case incidence of 22.08 \u223c 22 per equal number of inhabitants.",

Only the share of population with a long-term illness was kept in the model with the lowest AIC, but its effect is not significant in any of the regression specifications. Going from Model 1 to Model 2, it can be seen that the parameter estimate for PM 2.5 varies little after dropping the majority of health data controls, suggesting that the association between case incidence and pollution is not heavily impacted by adding or removing available data on possible pre-conditions. It is however important to ensure that the association between case incidence and pollution concentrations is not in fact driven by worse respiratory health in polluted areas. If worse respiratory health and aggravated symptoms in polluted areas are the main channels of action, higher COVID-19 case hospitalization rates should also be expected in these locations. For this reason, the percentage of the confirmed cases that resulted in hospital admission one week later (March 22 cases / March 31 hospital admissions times 100) was calculated as proxy for case severity. In 29 areas with no confirmed cases where hospitalizations occurred within a week, a value of 100 is assigned. In 9 areas where none of the confirmed cases resulted in hospitalization, a value of 0 is assigned. 16 Model 5b adds this additional proxy 16. The proxy is not perfect due to the low data density. Using instead the percentage of March 30 cases that resulted in March 31 hospitalization leads to only 4 replacements of both types (100/0).

The overall model fit improves as indicated by the AICc and R2. The estimate for PM 2.5 remains relatively unchanged and significant. While one would expect that case severity contributes to higher cases, as increased symptom severity may lead to higher case detection, the result suggests otherwise. One explanation is that high hospital admission occurred in areas with a weak case detection policy. In particular, if the disease goes unnoticed for long, the number of terminally ill patients can grow because they do not receive appropriate treatment in time. In this case, low case numbers can coincide with high hospital admission numbers. To investigate further whether the proxy captures a valuable signal related to symptom severity, appendix section 6.2.5 provides additional results that try to explain the case severity proxy using the other available predictors. These additional results find that age, male gender, and the share of population with overweight are positively associated with increased case hospitalization rates. This is in line with earlier identified risk groups (Ruan, 2020) , suggesting that the proxy does capture a relevant case severity signal.",

However, there are still some limitations to the basic regression results presented here. The standard linear regression model may not be perfectly suitable for modeling the number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants due to the non-negative nature of the data and a right skew in the case density distribution. Strong violations of the correct-specification assumption can result in biased estimates, for instance because the models assess linearity on an additive scale while the phenomenon is multiplicative. Instead of assessing the data on the original scale as a multiplicative error model with a changing variance function, this issue is often addressed by rewriting the model as an additive error model on the log-scale with constant variance. This is appropriate as long as the log transformation is appropriate to normalize the data. To assess whether the simple estimations presented here are prone to a strong bias, section 6.2.2 investigates the residual distribution and re-analyzes the data using a log-type power transformation from a family of functions that allows for zeros. The results highlight that when the data is appropriately scaled and multiple diagnostics confirm that the Normality assumption is in fact valid, PM 2.5 is still a highly significant positive predictor of case densities. Earlier studies on the role of ambient fine particles in the transmission risk of airborne disease have instead relied on Poisson-type regressions using count data. While these regressions are not entirely appropriate as they do not account for the highly significant geographical relationships in the data, section 6.2.1 presents Poisson-type results that allow for over-dispersion to show that the main conclusions are also robust to this specification choice.",

However, this time it also allows the model's parameters to vary across spatial gradients in unobserved components, such as related to weather. The model nests a linear model, specifically, higher levels of regularization result in linearized relationships. Evidence that the relationship with air pollution is nonlinear is strengthened by using Model (2) and re-estimating it after applying a third-order Taylor approximation to the PM 2.5 measurements.

The ranges in the quantiles highlight that there is substantial parameter heterogeneity. The nonlinear estimates suggest that at low levels of PM 2.5 , changes in particulate matter concentrations are not associated with significant changes in case incidence. However, after the mean annual concentrations cross the WHO guidelines of 10mcg/m3, the standard errors tighten and the number of expected cases increases sharply. At 12mcg/m3, the expected cases per 100,000 inhabitants are approximately double the numbers expected at 10mcg/m3. More indication of impacts is approximated by calculating the prediction difference when PM 2.5 moves from 10mcg/m3 to 12mcg/m3, leaving all other covariates at observed values. This is performed for all areas that have at least already 9mcg/m3 and case numbers within the 25% to 75% quantile range (between 8.3 and 31.7 cases per 100,000). The prediction difference is standardized based on the current actual case numbers and multiplied by 100, thus expressed as a percentage increase with respect to current case numbers. The results in figure 4 highlight the effect heterogeneity, suggesting that the modeled pollution association varies strongly depending on other covariates. Numerical integration under the kernel density suggests 80% of events result in positive increases in case incidence, and of these events the estimated average increase in cases per 100,000 inhabitants is 95% when particulate matter concentrations increase from 10mcg/m3 to 12mcg/m3. 12 .

However, it is difficult to perceive why sampling should structurally be related to pollution concentrations. Moreover, in light of the rich body of literature on the association between pollution exposure and respiratory tract infection risk, and the plausible parameter estimates with respect to many of the other variables, convenience sampling does not seem to be a more plausible explanation for the results than the findings of the study itself.

Even though this study was not able to find strong evidence for an impact of PM 2.5 on case severity, at the high levels of PM 2.5 in developing countries, more severe impacts on respiratory health may interact with case fatality of SARS-CoV-2. The possible association between pollution and symptom severity will thus be important to revisit, particularly because regional variation in case fatality of closely related SARS-CoV-1 has been associated with air pollution exposure (Cui et al., 2003) .",

One way to diagnose this is to inspect a Q-Q plot, which compares the standardized residuals to theoretical quantities from the Normal distribution. Figure 7 highlights that the Normality assumption is not entirely satisfied. Both Model 2 and Model 5 residuals contain outliers, particularly in the right tail of the distribution. In both models, the residuals follow a very similar pattern and the three major outliers that are prevalent on both specifications are Boekel, Uden and Bernheze which are all in the COVID-19 cluster in the province of Brabant. Outliers can be influential in a regression, though they do not necessarily have to be, while other points that lie within a normal range of the model can be influential without being an outlier per se. The impact of outlier observations depends also on the data density in the region around the data point. The Q-Q plots do not inform about whether the identified outlier observations are actually influential in the regression. Figure 8 calculates Cook's distance, a multivariate measure of influence, and identifies influential data points by evaluating the impact of individual observations on the regression results with respect to the covariates of interest through a leave-one-out procedure.

This is reassuring, nevertheless it is important due to the small sample nature of the applications to evaluate whether the identified mild violations have a drastic impact on the estimation results. Two regressions are performed to analyze this. First, Model 5c replaces the dependent values of the 8 observations that have visibly the largest residuals in the Q-Q plot with predicted values from Model 5 and re-estimates the specification. This allows comparing directly how the parameter estimates change when these outlier observations are replaced with values that lie closer to the normal range of the data. It is important to note that if these observations are not outliers in an additive sense, but simply reflect the nature of the data-generating process, then these new estimates have in fact an increased bias resulting from further mis-specification. To evaluate whether outliers can be addressed through model-specification, Model 5d first normalizes the data using a power transformation (Johnson) by finding the transformation that minimizes the p-value of a Shapiro test for Normality, and then re-estimates Model 5's specification on the more Gaussian data. These parameter values cannot be directly compared to the parameter values of Model 5 because the new relationship is nonlinear (logarithmic-type). Nevertheless, Model 5d informs whether the significance of relationships remains intact when the Normality violations are neutralized.",

This also suggests that the outliers whose values are now replaced with values closer to the normal range of the data are not necessarily outliers in an additive sense, but simply reflect the exponential nature of the data. From that regard, Model 5d is preferred, as it applies a suitable exponential transformation that clearly neutralizes any outlier or non-Gaussian behavior. In both models, the relationship with PM 2.5 remains significant and positive hence the conclusion is that the main findings of the analysis are not sensitive to outliers.",

However, it is possible that the estimated association between PM 2.5 concentrations and COVID-19 incidence can be attributed to worse respiratory health in polluted areas, which then leads to more severe symptoms and higher case detection. The analysis tried to control for this using health data and the percentage of confirmed cases that resulted in hospitalization as controls. This did not impact the results. A second way to further test this theory is by analyzing the association between PM 2.5 and the case hospitalization rate because worse respiratory health would lead to more severe COVID-19 disease (Ruan, 2020) . The suspect correlation is investigated below using step-wise AIC variable selection keeping PM 2.5 in the variable set, followed by the full spatial specification. Model 6 uses March 31 confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions as a percentage of March 22 confirmed COVID-19 cases, model 7 uses March 30 confirmed cases. The analysis finds that age, male gender, and the share of population with overweight are positively associated with increased case hospitalization rates which follows earlier identified risk groups (Ruan, 2020) .

This is to evaluate whether the relationship with PM 2.5 is robust to possible measurement error in the confirmed cases. The correlation between confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants on March 22 and March 31 hospital admissions is approximately .80, the correlation using March 30 confirmed cases is .88. It is clear from the estimation results that using confirmed admissions instead of cases does not alter the main conclusions.
