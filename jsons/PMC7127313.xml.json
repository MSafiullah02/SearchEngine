The autoAb were directed to a 40-kDa protein present in mouse liver and kidney. The autoAg was isolated and identified as fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), a soluble cytosolic enzyme that mediates the hydrolytic formation of fumarate and acetoacetate [10]. Furthermore, during FAH purification we found that the autoAb detected more weakly another liver protein, which turned to be the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). There was no correlation between the IgG titers and the presence of autoAb to liver FAH in CBA/Ht mice, suggesting that the autoAb production was not related to the non-specific polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes produced after viral infection. Additionally, mice immunized with extracts of mouse liver did not develop autoAb, thus discarding the release of a self-antigen as the mechanism involved in the autoimmune response elicited by MHV-infection [10].",

Thus, whereas western-blot assays indicated that autoAb were directed to cryptic FAH epitopes in all sera tested, ELISA results indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoAg (Fig. 1). These results could be explained taking into consideration that insolubilized proteins expose cryptic epitopes while still retaining some conformational features [17], [18]. Since proteins submitted to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose should be more denatured than those insolubilized on plastic surface, it is possible that the autoAb detected both conformational and cryptic epitopes in ELISA and only cryptic determinants in western-blot assays. So, sera showing lack of competition by the soluble autoAg in both protocols should have autoAb directed mostly to cryptic epitopes of the FAH, whereas those displaying dissimilar reactivity may have a mixture of autoAb directed to both hidden and conformational antigenic determinants of the enzyme.",
