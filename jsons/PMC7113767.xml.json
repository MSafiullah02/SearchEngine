Infection is rarely fatal, but in many cases it evolves into a chronic stage of persistent disabling polyarthritis that can severely incapacitate the patient for weeks and even up to several years (Simon et al., 2011).",

Current therapy consists of the use of analgesics, antipyretics and anti-inflammatory agents, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Thiberville et al., 2013). Aspirin should be avoided because of the risk for bleeding or the potential risk of the development of Reye\u2019s syndrome (Kucharz and Cebula-Byrska, 2012). In addition, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and sulphasalazine could be used in severe cases when NSAIDs are not effective (Ali Ou Alla and Combe, 2011, Kucharz and Cebula-Byrska, 2012). Because of the worldwide re-emergence of CHIKV (Weaver and Forrester, 2015), the development of potent antiviral drugs is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Similar to other alphaviruses, the entry of CHIKV into the host cell is facilitated by the interaction of the E2 envelope glycoprotein with receptors on the surface of the target cells (Fig. 1\n). Upon receptor binding, the virus is rapidly internalized through endocytosis. Within the endosome, conformational changes take place in the viral envelope glycoproteins due to the low pH environment, allowing the fusion between the E1 envelope glycoprotein and the endosomal membrane (Gould et al., 2010). This results in the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm where it is disassembled to release the viral RNA genome. Consequently, the viral genome is translated by the host cell machinery to generate the non-structural polyprotein which is cleaved to yield the nsP123 precursor and free nsP4 protein. The nsP123 precursor interacts with nsP4 and host proteins to form an initial replication complex (viral replicase) which synthesizes the negative-strand RNA (Solignat et al., 2009). The negative-strand RNA is then used as a template to synthesize positive-strand genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA (26S RNA). The 26S RNA serves as the mRNA for the synthesis of the polypeptide containing the structural viral proteins C-pE2-6K-E1 (Gould et al., 2010).",

The pE2 and E1 glycoproteins form heterodimer complexes that migrate towards the cell membrane through the Golgi complex. During this migration towards the cell surface, pE2 is cleaved by a cellular furin or furin-like proteinases to form mature E2 and E3. Finally, the nucleocapsid complexes assemble in the cytoplasm and bud through the cell membrane acquiring a lipid bilayer envelope that contains the virus-encoded glycoprotein E1-E2 (Gould et al., 2010). Several steps of the viral life cycle can be targeted to inhibit CHIKV replication.",

CHIKV pseudoparticles carrying the envelope proteins and tagged with a luciferase reporter (Selvarajah et al., 2013, Weber et al., 2015) and a heat-sensitive SFV strain (SFVts9-Rluc), characterized by severe defects in RNA replication at an elevated temperature (Pohjala et al., 2011), could be used to evaluate the effect of antiviral agents on CHIKV entry.",

However, clinical trials of chloroquine in CHIKV-infected patients could not prove its efficacy for treatment of CHIKV infection. Experiments in a macaque model also failed to demonstrate an antiviral effect of chloroquine (Roques et al., 2007). Furthermore, in a more recent study performed in India no benefit of chloroquine treatment over meloxicam (an NSAID) was observed in the treatment of early musculoskeletal pain and arthritis following acute CHIKV infection (Chopra et al., 2014). This divergence between the in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy of chloroquine was also reported for other viruses such as influenza (Paton et al., 2011) and Ebola virus (Falzarano et al., 2015). Similarly, clinical trials of chloroquine against influenza virus and Ebola virus failed to prove its effectiveness, despite significant in vitro activity against these viruses.",

Two analogues of arbidol were recently identified that had a somewhat higher selectivity index for inhibition of in vitro replication of CHIKV (Di Mola et al., 2014). An arbidol-resistant mutant strain was identified with a mutation of a glycine to an arginine (G407R) in the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein (Delogu et al., 2011). This amino acid position may be involved in binding to host receptors. The compound has been shown to inhibit CHIKV hemagglutination, suggesting that arbidol interferes with the replication cycle at the cell adsorption step (Delogu et al., 2011). Arbidol could also be incorporated into cellular membranes leading to alterations of the membrane structure and thereby interfering with stages of the virus life cycle that are membrane-dependent such as fusion with the endosomal membrane (Blaising et al., 2014) (Table 1\n).",

Moreover, CHIKV nsP2 was found to suppress type I/II interferon-stimulated JAK/STAT signaling leading to inhibition of the host antiviral response (Fros et al., 2013). Because of these diverse functions, nsP2 could be a target for CHIKV inhibitors.

In addition, treatment of infected AG129 mice with T-705 (oral dose, 300 mg/kg/day) protected these mice from severe neurological disease and reduced the mortality rate with more than 50%. No effect was observed on the specific infectivity of CHIKV (calculated as the ratio of infectious virus yield \u00d7 10\u22123 to the genome copy number), suggesting that error catastrophe is not underlying the inhibitory effect. Low-level T-705-resistant CHIKV variants were selected that carry a K291R mutation in the F1 motif of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This mutation was shown to be responsible for the phenotypic resistance against T-705. Interestingly, this lysine residue is highly conserved in the polymerase of other +ssRNA viruses, which may provide an explanation for the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of T-705 (Delang et al., 2014) (Table 1).",

The epitope of MAb C9 was identified in the acid-sensitive region of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein (Selvarajah et al., 2013).

            "text": "Fig. 1: Schematic representation of the replication cycle of chikungunya virus. CHIKV enters the cell by endocytosis following the binding of the E2 protein to specific receptor(s) on the cell surface. Within the endosome, the low pH triggers the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, leading to the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The nucleocapsid disassembles to liberate the viral genome, which is translated to produce the viral nonstructural proteins (nsP1\u20134). After processing, the nonstructural proteins complex to form the viral replicase, which catalyzes the synthesis of a negative-sense RNA strand to serve as a template for synthesis of both the full-length positive-sense genome and the subgenomic (26S) RNA. The subgenomic (26S) RNA is translated to produce the structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1), which is then cleaved to produce the individual structural proteins, followed by assembly of the viral components. The assembled virus particle is released by budding through the plasma membrane, where it acquires the envelope with embedded viral glycoproteins.",
