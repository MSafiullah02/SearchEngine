This research is driven by the demand for fast, low-cost, automated chemical analysis using minimal sample and reagent volumes, in a multiplicity of applications (deMello 2006), including interrogation of individual molecules (Craighead 2006). The scale of integration, low cost and robustness of microfabrication approaches enabled the ubiquitous presence of the mobile phone, hand-held computer and CCD camera, to name a few, in the last century. It is often suggested that products incorporating LoC technology will find similarly widespread use early in this century, for example in personal medicine, food safety, water management and security. Cost and reliability for use by non-specialist personnel will be key issues in achieving this goal, which could advance personalised preventative medicine and public safety, and improve efficiency in food and water use.",

These may include means for sample and reagent presentation such as channels, pumps and valves, chambers for mixing and reaction, heaters for reaction control, devices for trapping, separation and selection, devices for cell lysis, and for chemical analysis (El-Ali et al. 2006). The last decade has seen rapid growth in demonstrations of these functions in chips fabricated using either \u201chard lithography\u201d in semiconductors or glass or \u201csoft lithography\u201d (Xia and Whitesides 1998) in polymers such as PDMS. The former builds upon the functionality of silicon MEMS and the enormous infrastructure of the microelectronics industry and points to its example of cost reduction in complex electronic systems. The latter exploits the benefits of improved compatibility with biological systems and the simplicity of rapid prototyping in polymers. The emergence of preferred materials for the LoC will depend upon the degree to which components can be standardised and selected for integration to satisfy large-volume applications.",

More recently there has been increasing interest in using optical forces as a non-contact means for trapping and separation in microsystems, and for driving pumps. The use of light for \u201coptoporation\u201d of cells in microsystems has also been demonstrated (Soughayer et al. 2000). Users of microfluidic systems for (bio)chemical analysis are familiar with conventional optical systems for chemical analysis and increasingly with the optical manipulation approaches first demonstrated by Ashkin (1970). However, the majority of optical functions demonstrated in microfluidic systems use external micro-optical systems, or hybrid embedding of optical fibres, which, while providing much flexibility, do not offer the robustness, stability, operator-independence, and potential for mass manufacture of fully integrated approaches.",

The original motivation for this innovation was in optical telecommunications, but its application to chemical sensing was soon demonstrated in 1974 (Mitchell 1977), where bilirubin in neonatal whole blood was measured in a waveguide evanescent field. Integrated optics is widely used in biosensing and chemical sensing research, but there have been rather few demonstrations in true microfluidic systems. Until recently, most integrated optical circuits consisted of only one or two devices, but the field appears to be maturing with a drive for standardisation of materials, devices and interfaces, allowing much denser integration (Smit et al. 2007), and proposals for photonic circuit foundries which will allow \u201cfab-less\u201d researchers with design and measurement tools to access high-quality device fabrication. The confluence of integrated optics with integrated fluidics in the future LoC shows great potential.",

The use of longitudinal optical propulsion for Chinese hamster ovary cell sorting using radiation pressure was demonstrated by Buican et al (1987) as the \u201cbasis of a miniaturized and automated cell biology laboratory\u201d. Terray et al. (2005) exploited optical propulsion in a weakly focussed beam combined with opposing fluid flow in a microfluidic system to achieve optical separation or chromatography (Imasaka 1998) of Bacillus anthracis spores and mulberry pollen, dependent upon particle size and refractive index. This was followed, using the configuration shown in Fig. 1, by separation of B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis (Hart et al. 2006) and sample concentration in which every cell of the selected type flowing in the channel was sorted (Hart et al. 2007). Another approach to microfluidic optophoresis was demonstrated by Zhang et al. (2004), in which reduction of cell flow velocity due to a single-beam trap crossing the channel was used to identify cancerous and non-cancerous cells by time-of-flight, with detection through scattering from a probe laser beam.\n\n",

An array of single beam traps generated using a VCSEL array was used to optically capture and manipulate in three dimensions a 2 \u00d7 2 array of red blood cells, and independently release them (Flynn et al. 2002). Further biological applications of this system are described by Ozkan et al.

Wang et al. (2005) then built upon the latter and demonstrated optical switching in a microfluidic fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) citing improved buffer medium compatibility when compared with electrokinetic and dielectrophoretic methods. Throughput of GFP-expressing HeLa cells was up to 100 cells/s and recovery rates were >85%. No evidence of cell stress was observed in the recovered populations.",

            "text": "Stable trapping is particularly important when acquiring weak signals such as Raman spectra, as it allows improved noise reduction. Ramser et al. (2005) employed a single beam trap in an electro-osmotically controlled microfluidic system to observe Raman spectra of individual erythrocytes during the oxygenation cycle. The trapping beam entered from one side of the flow channel, while the Raman excitation and collection was configured on the opposite side of the channel, as shown in Fig. 2, allowing independent optimisation. The oxygenation cycle was clearly observed, but the high-intensity trapping illumination at a wavelength of 1,064 nm was observed to accelerate transfer of Hb to metHb, and lack of this deleterious effect at a trapping wavelength of 830 nm was noted. Neuman et al. (1999) conducted detailed multiwavelength measurements and showed that wavelengths of 830 and 970 nm are preferred for minimising cell damage. Buican et al. (1987) noted that a counterpropagating dual-beam trap may be preferred over the single-beam trap in practical cell manipulation, and this was emphasised by Jess et al. (2006) who realised a dual beam fibre trap [first demonstrated by Constable et al. (1993)] for Raman spectroscopy of cells in a simple microfluidic system, yielding localised Raman spectra from within primary trapped human keratinocites. The divergent fields result in a large area trap and allow large objects such as cells to be held and manipulated with greater positional control and reduced risk of photodamage when compared with conventional optical tweezers. An elegant application of a dual beam fibre trap to study the deformability of cells as a new biological marker for disease was demonstrated by Guck et al. (2005), and is illustrated in Fig. 3. The trap captures a cell in a microflow channel, centres it in the channel, and stretches the cell towards the opposing fibres to an extent dependent upon the incident power. The power dependent deformation, observed on a CCD camera, depends upon the cell rigidity, and may be used to distinguish between normal and cancerous human breast epithelial cells, for example.\n\n\n",

            "text": "A 100-\u03bcm long line-trap, rather than a point trap, has been generated by focussing a diode laser bar in a microflow channel (Applegate et al. 2004). Bovine red blood cells were captured by the line trap, which was placed at an angle to the flow direction, and the cells were conveyed along it before being released at its end, thereby deflecting cells of a certain size; time-dependent interruption of the beam may be used to sort cells into different fluidic output channels. Subsequently, optical waveguides written into a block of fused silica placed under the microfluidic system were used to excite fluorescence in line-trapped dye-doped polystyrene microspheres, allowing fluorescent-based activation of sorting (Applegate et al. 2006). The use of a potential landscape or optical lattice (Korda et al. 2002; MacDonald et al. 2003), where interference produces an array of traps has been employed to selectively deflect monodisperse 2 \u03bcm protein microcapsules from a externally pumped stream of polydisperse particles, and to sort erythrocytes from lymphocytes, in a simple microflow system (MacDonald et al. 2004). This approach has the advantage of flexibility in tailoring the potential barriers and thus the interconnection of traps for particle sorting. Paterson et al. (2005) observed that the requirement for external pumping of the fluid could be removed by breaking the symmetry of the lattice, for example by tilting the potential, and Milne et al. (2007) demonstrated simultaneous separation of four sizes of silica sphere between 2 and 7 \u03bcm into parallel output flows using an acousto-optically generated potential landscape, demonstrating simple programmable reconfigurability of the landscape. Further approaches to deflecting particles dependent upon their optical properties include the use of a composite microlens array to form a linear array of \u201coptical rods\u201d across a 2-D flow plane (Sun et al. 2006b).",

Cran-McGreehin et al. (2006a, b) demonstrated integration of semiconductor lasers emitting directly into a microfluidic channel, as shown in Fig. 4, to realise two dual-beam traps and demonstrate trapping of polymer spheres and shunting of these spheres between traps. The device was realised in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with InAs quantum dots emitting at 1290 nm, with microflow channel realised using chemically assisted ion-beam etching. This approach provides the potential for monolithic integration of all the optics and fluidics in highly functional devices, and potentially removes the need for any optical connection to the chip, which is often the most difficult aspect particularly for users not specialised in optics.\n\n",

The evanescent approach allows convenient manipulation at a surface, improved stability as the radiation does not propagate through the liquid medium and, with the use of appropriate apertures, greater spatial localisation through the near-field, but the fields are normally restricted to within a few hundred nanometres of the surface. Forces in an evanescent field were exploited by Garc\u00e9s-Ch\u00e1vez et al. (2005) to guide and trap red blood cells over an area of order 1 mm2. A grating of period 12 \u03bcm was imaged on the base of a prism and the cells assembled along the lines of high intensity and moved along them under radiation pressure. A counter-propagating beam with the same grating pattern was used to produce the same gradient force pattern but equal and opposite radiation pressure forces parallel to the surface, thereby producing stationary traps. Control of the relative beam powers was used to control the velocity of cells from stationary to about 1 \u03bcm/s. Mellor and Bain (2006) used a similar two-beam geometry without the grating image, and both with and without resulting interference fringes, to study the interplay of trapping and optical binding forces on collections of spheres of order 500 nm diameter to produce ordered arrays with controlled sphere spacings.",

            "text": "In addition to directly manipulating particles in microfluidic systems, there is a need for pumps and mixers to manipulate fluids themselves. While there are many demonstrations of pumps in microsystems, optically actuated pumps and mixers may have the advantages of simple reconfigurability, integration and small size, compared with external and piezo-electric pumps, and fewer constraints on the properties of the liquid medium compared to electrokinetic pumps. Colloidal particles, appropriately assembled into a microflow channel or chamber and manipulated using optical traps to provide pump action, are the most widely reported, with the two-lobe \u201cgear pump\u201d shown in Fig. 5 formed from four 3 \u03bcm particles, and a peristaltic pump formed from six such particles, being demonstrated by Terray et al. (2002). The particles comprising the pump were individually assembled and manipulated using scanning laser optical trapping, using a piezo-electric mirror under computer control to realise a time-averaged trapping pattern, with flow rates of 3 \u03bcm/s being achieved. Ladavac and Grier (2004) employed an array of ring traps, or optical vortices, formed by using a hologram to split laser light into two rows of three circular traps of few micron diameter; 800 nm silica spheres in the fluid were drawn into the rings and propelled around them by transfer of angular momentum. The helical phase functions for the optical modes driving the rings in the upper and lower rows were chosen such that their rotations were in opposite senses, so that the circulating rings of colloidal spheres caused the liquid between the rows to flow with velocities up to 5 \u03bcm/s. Leach et al. (2006) constructed a micropump by optically trapping two birefringent vaterite spheres of 6 \u03bcm diameter in a microflow channel and causing them to rotate in opposite directions, achieving a pump speed of up to 8 \u03bcm/s (200 fl/s). A single input beam was split using a Wollaston prism and waveplates to provide two traps with circular polarisation in opposite sense, imparting angular momentum to the spheres and causing them to rotate in opposite senses.\n\n",

(2005). The microgears, a few microns in diameter, were fabricated in SU-8 by e-beam lithography, released from their substrate, placed in the microflow system and positioned and rotated by the optical trap. Micropumps in which the rotors are fabricated around fixed shafts and rotated using optical forces have been demonstrated by Kelemen et al. (2006) and Maruo and Inoue (2006). Kelemen et al. incorporated an eccentrically positioned optical waveguide illuminating one side of the propeller to rotate it using scattering forces. All components were realised on a glass substrate by direct two-photon writing in photopolymers, and a rotation rate of 2 Hz was achieved with waveguide power of about 25 mW. Although reconfigurability is limited in this approach, as the propeller is \u201ctrapped\u201d by an axle rather than by an optical trap, no complex external optics is required, the pump does not have to be assembled optically, and rotation is simply driven by waveguide power. Maruo and Inoue demonstrated a micropump shown in Fig. 6, with two counter-rotating meshing rotors in a protrusion in a 5 \u03bcm \u00d7 7 \u03bcm channel, rotating around fixed shafts, which achieved a pump rate up to 0.7 \u03bcm/s. All the structures were written by direct two-photon writing in photopolymer, and the rotors were driven by \u201ctime-divided laser scanning\u201d, dividing the beam and scanning the two resultant beams in opposite circular trajectories using galvano scanners.\n\n",

Scattering is probably the simplest method for cell counting in a microchannel, but can be extended to yield information on cell size, shape and internal and external structure according to the angular scattering spectrum, and is commonly combined with fluorescence measurements to yield chemically specific information. This is a natural extension of traditional bulk flow cytometry systems where scattering may be employed to increase detection reliability and the resolvability of fluorescent signals. Laser light is focussed on a detection volume and the scattering caused by a refractive index contrast between the particle entering that volume and the surrounding fluid allows detection of particles. Large angle scattering can give information a particle\u2019s surface roughness and internal structures; whilst small angle or forward scattering can yield information of a particle\u2019s size. Given the information which can be gained, scattering is surprisingly underutilised in microfluidic devices, perhaps due to the fact that most implementations are dependant on alignment of bulk external optics at the necessary angles.",

The design allowed for optical extinction and large-angle scattering to be measured, but this was not discussed in detail.

Its simplicity, and the lack of need for chemical derivitisations for fluorescent tagging, has led to it being the most widely used detection technique in conventional microseparations. However, the short optical path length inherent in miniaturization of fluidic channels leads to weak optical absorption competing with a high background transmission, and consequent difficulty in achieving low detection limits. This has been addressed in conventional capillary systems using Z-shaped and U-shaped channels (e.g. Moring et al. 1993) with longitudinal transmission. The problem becomes more severe in on-chip systems, and several approaches to increasing the absorption have been demonstrated, such as liquid-core waveguiding, multipass configurations, hollow prism cells, integrated waveguides and \u201cslow light\u201d. Detection limit depends upon good stability and reduced noise as much as increased sensitivity, rendering waveguiding approaches attractive.",

They further increased this to an effective optical path length of 1.2 mm using novel pure silica integrated waveguides shown in Fig. 8 (Mogensen et al. 2004); using absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm a detection limit of 3 \u03bcg ml\u22121 was achieved for paracetamol, and electrophoretic separation allowed caffeine, paracetamol, and ketoprofone to be distinguished.

Mortensen and Xiao (2007) have recently modeled the use of \u201cslow light\u201d structures for optical path-length enhancement. Periodic structures such as liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals could be incorporated within a flow channel and potentially yield large enhancements particularly near the band edges. Duggan et al. (2003) achieved an optical path length of 5 mm by using a Teflon fluoropolymer capillary as both the flow channel and a liquid-core waveguide, and Teflon AF coated waveguiding microflow channels in silicon have also been realised (Datta et al. 2003). However, extending the physical path-length along the direction of flow also degrades the spatial resolution of species in capillary separation systems, resulting in a trade-off between enhancement and resolution. Performance of absorbance based measurements can also be improved by incorporating additional on-chip optical components, such as microlenses and micro-apertures, to reduce stray light and hence increase the effective optical path length (Ro et al. 2005). Zhu et al. (2006) improved collection efficiency by incorporating bare silicon detectors within the PDMS fluidic chip and reported a LoD for bovine serum albumin of 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 with channels of 60\u2013400 \u03bcm depth. Llobera and co-workers developed monolithically integrated hollow prism microchannels combined with optical components in a single-step PDMS microfabrication process (Llobera et al. 2004, 2005). The device, shown schematically in Fig. 9, consisted of channels to embed input and output fibres and cylindrical biconvex microlenses to collimate the light, pass it through the hollow prism filled with analyte, reflecting from a prism wall to enhance path-length, and refocus it on the output fibre.

Tagging has the disadvantage that additional sample preparation must be carried out, but usually yields lower fluorescent background and improved confidence in the measurement. Due to the vast literature on this topic, in this section only work published within the last 2 years will be discussed to highlight the most recent advances in applications of fluorescence in microfluidic systems.",

Lasers and \u201claser-induced fluorescence\u201d (LIF) are most commonly employed in microfluidics, due to diffraction-limited focussing and the potential for 2-photon excitation. The increasing range of wavelengths, continually reducing cost due to use in consumer electronics, good stability, ease of switching, and low power requirements when using semiconductor lasers reinforce this trend. Longer wavelength fluorophores (600 nm < \u03bbabs < 800 nm) tend to be gaining ground due to the reduced background fluorescence and wider availability of high-quality compact optical components at these wavelengths.",

            "text": "Recent research has emphasised electrokinetic methods for concentrating species to be detected, thereby improving LoD, with most using conventional external optical apparatus such as confocal microscopes. It has been shown that field-amplified stacking injection (FASI) in microfluidic capillary electrophoresis devices can increase sensitivity of detection of fluorescent dyes (Gong et al. 2006). Using a microfluidic chip with several channel networks, detection of immunoassays of insulin secretions from multiple independent pancreatic islets can be continuously monitored with an LoD of 10 nM (Dishinger and Kennedy 2007). Sun and Yin (2006a) reported a multi-depth microfluidic device for single cell analysis. Human carcinoma cells which tend to aggregate and settle were separated using this device and the cell constituents separated by CE and analysed using LIF. Flow cytometry is an important function to benefit from microfluidics technology, with many continuous-flow microfluidic devices demonstrating fluorescent-activated cell sorting (\u03bcFACS). Morgan and co-workers (Morgan et al. 2006; Holmes et al. 2006) reported devices that used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to focus particles in a microchannel stream. Figure 10 shows a micro flow cytometer chip, which focused particles in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions and detected 6 \u03bcm diameter fluorescent latex particles. Using careful optimisation of the excitation intensity to limit fluorophore saturation, Jung et al. (2007a) obtained an extremely low LoD of 100 attoM, and single molecule detection, of Alexa Fluor 488 by LIF in a CE chip flow with isotachophoretic separation. Hydrodynamic focussing has also been applied in microfluidic systems with fluorescence detection. Yang et al. (2006) realised a portable system incorporating a microfluidic device with hydrodynamic focussing and on-chip pumping and applied it to detection and sorting of fluorescent dye-labelled human lung cancer cells, with a count rate of 120 min\u22121 and an error rate better than 2%. Simonnet and Groisman (2006) created high-throughput flow cytometers (17,000 s\u22121) in molded PDMS with \u201c3D\u201d hydrodynamic focussing, and applied them to tagged yeast cells. Kamei and Wada (2006) built upon earlier work (Kamei et al 2005) demonstrating microfluidic separation of biomolecules, and realised a detection platform shown in Fig. 11, which included a 2 mm diameter half-ball lens for fluorescence collection, a microstructured interference filter deposited directly on a pin photodiode, and an aperture through the centre of the detector and filter via which excitation light from a 488 nm frequency-doubled VCSEL was introduced. A planar microfluidic CE device was placed in contact with the half-ball lens, exciting fluorescein in the microchannel and allowing fluorescence to be collimated, filtered and collected. The device achieved an LoD of 7 nM fluorescein and was used to demonstrate the separation and detection of HaeIII-digested \u00f8X174 bacteriophage DNA. Breakthrough of scattered excitation light is often the limiting factor in performance of fluorescence-based systems. Fu et al. (2006) performed a detailed study of the directionality of scattered excitation light and fluorescence, which enabled maximization of the fluorescent to scattered power ratio by selecting the fluorescence collection angle. Excitation light was incident orthogonally to the microfluidic substrate and collected in the plane of the substrate from the chip sidewall, as shown in Fig. 12, with angles of 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 to the flow-channel exhibiting the best performance. An LoD of 1.1 pM fluorescein was achieved, and the device demonstrated CE of tagged arginine and phenylalanine.\n\n\n\n",

(2006) realised ion-exchanged waveguides in soda-lime glass integrated with etched microfluidic channels and used fibre-coupled laser light at 532 nm for excitation of the Cy3 dye. Collection was carried out orthogonally from the top of the chip using a lens or bonded fibre, achieving an LoD as low as 0.5 nM Cy3, and collinearly in a waveguide on the opposite side of the channel, achieving an LoD of 1 \u03bcM Cy3. The orthogonal configuration was then used to demonstrate CE of Cy3 and Cy3-tagged streptavidin. Bernini et al. (2006) used antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) structures to realise microfluidic channels that guided excitation light in the liquid, an alternative approach to the Teflon-clad waveguides described above. Although the liquid core has a lower refractive index than the surrounding media, the dual-layer cladding forms a high reflectivity mirror, which traps the light without invoking total internal reflection. Laser light was coupled into the flow channel via a fibre inserted into the hydrodynamically focused sample stream and two detector fibres were inserted in microchannels perpendicular to the main channel to capture fluorescent light from passing particles. The system was tested with human T leukaemia cells with diameters of about 20 \u03bcm.",

            "text": "Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful technique for the determination of the physical properties of small numbers of fluorescent or dye-tagged molecules. To ensure that only small numbers of molecules are studied at one time, the excitation volume is minimised by focussing to a small volume and using confocal detection. A correlation analysis of the temporal fluorescence fluctuations of particles entering the optical detection volume yields information on the diffusion characteristics and other physical properties of the molecules under study. Yeh et al. (2006) assembled an FCS system with a complex PDMS microfluidic network, consisting of on-chip serpentine channels for mixing, interrogation chambers, reservoirs and valves, as shown in Fig. 13. In a single flow-chip, the drug doxorubicin was mixed to produce eight parallel streams of different concentration; each stream was then mixed with a complex of DNA with transcription factor Sp1, and incubated in eight parallel interrogation chambers. Sp1-DNA dissociation was then determined by FCS, exploiting the different diffusion kinetics of differently sized entities to determine the fractions of bound and unbound DNA. The resultant dose-response titration curve yielded the Sp1-DNA binding inhibition versus drug concentration. Rapid detection of low numbers of viruses for medical diagnostics is an important field of application of microfluidics. Zhang et al. (2006) detected dengue virus with fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), using dengue-specific antibody in a PDMS microfluidic array structure. The virus and antibody were fluorescently labelled with two different fluorophores, excited at 488 and 633 nm, and the emission separated by a dichroic filter onto two APDs. Viruses bound to antibodies entering the detection volume exhibited positively cross-correlated fluorescence signals due to their motion being coupled. This study suggests that detection of a single virus is achievable with this system. Hollars et al. (2006) also performed a cross-correlation of two fluorescence labelled probes excited and emitting at different wavelengths, in a flowing system. In this case total internal reflection was used to excite the dye-tagged analyte in an evanescent field in the microchannel. Short non-amplified DNA sequences were measured to sub 100 pM levels in less than 1 min.\n\n",

G\u00f6tz and Karst (2007b) used a xenon arc lamp as an excitation source combined with a spectrograph and CCD, providing more detailed information through the complete emission spectrum in the visible wavelength range (350\u2013800 nm). Three rhodamine dyes were used to characterise the system, applied to a standard microfluidic chip performing CE for separation of analytes. Peaks in the elution spectra could be assigned to different pure analytes and unexpected impurities were detected both by CE separation and within an elution peak using spectral information. Using similar apparatus the group were then able to detect thiols found in cosmetics with an LoD of 2 \u03bcM (Revermann et al. 2007) and taurine found in drinks with concentrations as low as 60 aM (G\u00f6tz et al. 2007c).

Destandau et al. (2007) have reported a simple Y-shaped microfluidic channel and a simple LED and PMT detecting potassium with a LoD of 0.5 mM using calyx-bodipy dye, which has fluorescence intensity sensitive to potassium concentration. Kim et al. (2006) realised a highly integrated fluorescent microfluidic detection chip comprising the microfluidic channels, silicon detector with interference filter, and an integrated organic LED (OLED) deposited directly on to glass as a thin-film structure. The microchannels were etched in glass with dimensions 70 \u03bcm width and 20 \u03bcm depth, and the OLED, emitting at 530 nm, was deposited on the reverse of the substrate. A p-i-n photodiode with a deposited interference filter was buried in PDMS, which was then bonded to the glass microchannel. The device was characterised using tetramethylrhodamine dye (TAMRA) and achieved an LoD of 10 \u03bcM. Hofmann et al. (2006) realised microchannels in a PDMS slab, which had been doped with lysochrome dye and acted as a high-quality filter itself. 1 mm thick samples doped with 1,200 \u03bcg ml\u22121 Sudan II, for example, showed <0.01% transmission at 500 nm and >80% transmission above 570 nm. Irawan et al. (2006) realised microchannels for use as fluorescence detection cells in PMMA optical fibre and plastic clad silica optical fibre by laser ablation. Microchannels of dimension 100 \u03bcm width by 210 \u03bcm depth were etched into the fibre cores and fluorescein, excited by a blue LED (centre wavelength at 470 nm), measured with an LoD of 5 ng l\u22121.",

            "text": "Protein and DNA detection and manipulation are major fields of application in microfluidic systems due to the benefits of rapidity, flow control and small sample and reagent volumes at these scales. Shen et al. (2006) developed an array of CE microchannels connected to reservoirs in soda-lime glass to perform parallel detection of fluorescent-tagged biomolecules. Light from a diode-pumped solid-state laser at 473 nm was line-focussed across the parallel measurement and reference channels and a CCD camera with filter was used to detect fluorescence simultaneously from all channels. Parallel CE separation allowed simultaneous detection of many fluorescently labelled molecules such as amino acids, proteins and nucleic acids. A similar system was realised in PMMA by Liu et al. (2006), working in the same group, and successfully applied to rapid detection of multiplex PCR products for SARS and hepatitis B. Huang et al. (2007) fabricated a sophisticated microfluidic network in PDMS to analyse low-copy number proteins in a single cell by single molecule detection. Individual cells were trapped, lysed, and the proteins in the lysate bound with fluorescently labelled antibodies and then separated using CE. A line-focused laser beam ensured that all molecules across the width and depth of the detection microchannel (40 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.8 \u03bcm) were detected, while in the direction of flow it was still tightly focussed to reduce background fluorescence. Edgar et al. (2006) performed detection of fluorescein-labelled amino acids contained in 10 fl droplets. The device consisted of a T-channel 3 \u03bcm wide by 3 \u03bcm deep that separates a CE channel (50 \u03bcm wide by 50 \u03bcm deep) from the droplet generation input by using an immiscible liquid. LIF is then performed in the CE channel. Oh et al. (2006) genetically engineered E. coli cells to cause them to express capture proteins and present them at the membrane surface. DEP cell traps were used to immobilise the cells in 200 \u03bcm wide microchannels, which then captured fluorescently labelled target molecules. Dual wavelength fluorescence measurements were performed on the cells to detect the bound molecules and reference to the number of capture ligands. This technique provides a convenient method to produce surfaces with immobilised capture molecules. Direct UV-excited fluorescence offers the potential for label-free protein analysis in individual cells. Hellmich et al. (2006) performed direct UV fluorescence measurements on amino acids and proteins, using a frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser and photomultiplier. Individual cells were optically trapped and electrically lysed on an PDMS/quartz chip, and the lysate separated by CE. Optimisation of the confocal optics and addition of carbon black into the PDMS led to a reduction in background florescence and an LoD of 25 nM for tryptophan.",

            "text": "DNA hybridisation to a free DNA probe sequence in solution is much faster than to immobilised DNA sequences, due to the diffusion-limited kinetics of the latter. Thus detection of hybridisation of target and probe in a microflow system, with suitable mixing, presents considerable advantages in terms of speed. Lee and co-workers (Yea et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2007) implemented a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system in a PDMS microfluidic device with an \u201calligator teeth\u201d structure for efficient mixing in otherwise laminar flow, shown in Fig. 14b. As the probe and hybridised target is not immobilised, washing cannot be used to remove the unbound target, so an alternative labelling scheme is required. Yea et al. (2006) employed a system where both the target DNA and probe strands were labelled, and relative intensities yielded the fraction of hybridised DNA. To avoid the need to label the target DNA, Kim et al (2007) then employed a molecular beacon, shown in Fig. 14a, where one end of a single-stranded oligonucleotide has a fluorophore attached and the other end has a quencher attached. In the absence of the target sequence, emission is quenched as the probe sequence forms a loop and the fluorophore and quencher are in close proximity. Hybridisation of the complementary target causes the loop to open, the fluorophore and quencher to separate and fluorescence to be observed. Liu et al. (2007) report a portable genetic analysis system for forensic applications and have validated it using samples extracted from oral swabs and human bone extracts. The glass microfluidic chip performed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis followed by parallel four-wavelength fluorescence detection using a 488 nm frequency-doubled diode laser and confocal optics, with optical fibre as confocal aperture.\n\n",

(2007) created single and multi probe particles encoded with a spatial fluorescent pattern for multiplexed detection of DNA oligomers at 500 attomoles. The encoded particles were created in a continuous microflow system, shown in Fig. 15a, where laminar fluorescently labelled monomer and probe-labelled monomer flows are introduced adjacently. Elongated polymer particles (\u223c90 \u03bcm wide by 30 \u03bcm deep by up to 270 \u03bcm long) were formed in the channel by exposing the monomers to 30 ms bursts of UV to photopolymerise them. The shape of the particles was defined by a mask in the UV projection system, which included the 20-dot pattern at one end, yielding more than one million possible codes. The resultant particles, which have a fluorescent graphically encoded region and covalently coupled probe-carrying regions, as shown in Fig. 15b, are collected in a reservoir. After incubation with the fluorescent-labelled target the particles are read by passing them through a microfluidic channel a little wider than the particle width. The particles are hydrodynamically focused and aligned along the channel and when they pass through the detection region the fluorescent intensities are detected using a CCD camera and analysed in five \u201clanes\u201d along the particles, corresponding to the rows of dots in the code, so that the particle\u2019s code is read and the presence of the target is detected. The external optics employed in microfluidic LIF systems is often complex. Huang et al. (2006a) performed on-chip PCR and CE in PDMS/PMMA/glass multilayer device with an embedded optical fibre for fluorescence collection to reduce the complexity of collection. They detected S. pneumoniae bacteria and the dengue-2 virus by separating and detecting amplified DNA products.\n\n",

Riegger et al. (2006) performed sandwich immunoassays for hepatitis A and tetanus in a centrifugally propelled disk-based microfluidic system with an LED light source. CdSe QDs were used to identify the beads and fluorescent polystyrene microspheres were used to identify presence of the bound antigen. Haes et al.

Two detection points, one just as the streams merge and one downstream, were used to monitor the extent of diffusion over the length of the channel, and the relative deflections yielded information on analyte diffusion coefficient and molecular weight. Leung et al. (2004) analysed bubbles in microchannels 40 \u03bcm wide and 30 \u03bcm deep, for application in on-line reaction monitoring and safety applications. As a bubble passes through the microchannel the deflection of laser light due to the refractive index perturbation is recorded using a position-sensitive detector. Performing statistical analysis on the data the system is able to determine bubble size and formation frequency. Using a hollow Abbe prism as a microfluidic chamber, as described above for absorption monitoring (Fig. 9), Llobera et al.

(2006) fabricated a Fabry\u2013Perot (FP) microfluidic cavity in which microchannels of up to 30 \u03bcm deep and 200 \u03bcm wide were etched in Pyrex and the top and bottom coated with 35 nm thick gold layers to serve as reflectors. Using an LED as a broadband source and measuring the transmission spectrum of the device, they performed intracavity measurements on single particles such as yeast cells; human red and white blood cells could be distinguished, although improved quantification is needed. Song et al. (2006) realised a microfluidic network incorporating a dual-fibre Fabry\u2013Perot, with channels for insertion of cells and two buffer solutions, two single mode fibres with high reflectivity gold-coated ends crossing the fluid channel to act as the FP cavity and as optical input and output, and a pressure-based cell-holder to trap the cell between the two fibres, as shown in Fig. 17. The cavity was 35.5 \u03bcm long and two buffer solutions having different refractive indices were alternated while the cell was trapped in position by the cell holder. The differences in the spectra with the two buffer media were reported to yield the effective refractive index of the cell with a standard deviation of \u00b10.2%, and cell size with an SD of \u00b14% for repeated measurements of the same cell, being released and retrapped.\n\n",

Integration of these sensors with microfluidic circuits is essential for repeatable performance, integration of reference sensors, enhanced interaction of analyte and surface, and low-cost manufacture, and the LoC may benefit greatly from these well-developed techniques. Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are one of the most sensitive waveguide devices for evanescent refractive index measurement (Quigley et al. 1999), particularly if active electro-optic control is employed (Heideman and Lambeck 1999). Lechuga and co-workers have reported the development of an MZI using CMOS compatible technology integrated with an SU-8 microfluidic channel (Blanco et al. 2006; Sep\u00falveda et al. 2006), achieving an LoD for bulk refractive index of 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22126.",

            "text": "Gratings are attractive components for interrogation of refractive index in microfluidic systems, as they allow relaxed optical alignment compared with direct end-coupling into waveguides (Duveneck et al. 2002). Yuen et al. (2005) realised a polymer H-shaped microfluidic device integrated with a grating for sensing, in which a reference fluid and analyte fluid could be passed over the grating under the same conditions and measured simultaneously. Laser light is incident through a polariser and focused via a lens to provide many angles to couple into the grating. Light is coupled into the waveguide at the angle where the grating provides phase matching, and this angle changes depending on the refractive index of the material at the grating surface; the light then couples out of the waveguide and is recorded by a CCD camera. Tests with biotin/streptavidin assays were conducted to demonstrate detection of small molecule binding. Sarov et al. (2006) employed a grating realised with a PMMA microprism on a glass microchannel lid, requiring multi-step fabrication. Laser light enters the prism under total internal reflection, so that the grating is irradiated and an evanescent field penetrates the microchannel. Reflected and diffracted light exits the prism and the energy redistribution into the diffracted orders allows the determination of the refractive index and the absorption coefficient of the fluid. The device had an index sensitivity of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 and an absorption coefficient sensitivity of 3.5 \u00d7 106 m\u22121. Choi and Cunningham (2006) fabricated grating structures with a period of 550 nm as the sensors on the floor of a microchannel, by molding followed by deposition of a thin titania film. Using a white light source the grating is irradiated perpendicular to the grating with polarised light, and the reflected light, whose wavelength depends strongly on the refractive index of the medium in contact with the grating, is directed back to an imaging spectrometer. The key advantage of this approach is that an array of small sensor patches (\u223c10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm) can be imaged as independent sensors, allowing the potential for dense integration. The device detects changes of refractive index in the microchannel as a shift in the peak wavelength of reflection. Discrimination between chicken IgG and pig IgG was demonstrated using Protein A as the immobilised protein ligand.",

Detection depends upon angle- or wavelength-dependent coupling to a lossy surface plasma wave at a metal surface, whose velocity changes with refractive index resulting in a change in reflected power. The potential for low reagent and sample volumes and fast reactions is driving further miniaturization and integration of SPR devices in microfluidic systems. Furuki et al. (2001) realised photopatterned microchannels with floors coated with a gold film. The device was excited using a prism in the Kretschmann configuration where light is reflected from the 60 nm thick gold layer, tunneling through it to excite a surface plasmon on the liquid side of the film in each channel. A sequence of cysteamine, photobiotin, and avidin was bound to the surface and measured by SPR. The results were consistent with those measured by atomic force microscopy, and the channel sample volume was reduced to about 8 nl. Wheeler et al. (2004) fabricated micro-flow cells designed to be attached to the commercial SpreetaTM SPR sensor by soft lithography in PDMS using conventional photoresist processing. Refractive index changes due to biotinylated bovine serum albumin, streptavidin, biotinylated protein A, and human immunoglobulin each bound to the preceding layer were monitored. Using volumes as low as 73 nl, the data were consistent those obtained with conventional flow cells of volume 8 \u03bcl. Recently more sophisticated microfluidic SPR devices have been reported. Huang et al. (2006b) realised a complex integrated flow circuit with many microfluidic components, and detection regions for three analytes in one channel. The optical excitation and detection was again achieved using an external prism in the Kretschmann configuration. Temperature control was incorporated into the device, as all refractive index based sensors are sensitive to temperature variations. Molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) films were used as the recognition element for specific biomolecules. MIPs specific to testosterone, cholesterol, and progesterone were pattered on the gold and detection of these three analytes successfully demonstrated at physiologically normal concentrations. This microfluidic SPR system demonstrated direct detection of low molecular weight analytes, higher association rates between analyte and MIP compared with a conventional SPR system due to more efficient interaction between biomolecules and MIP films, and reduced sample consumption.",

Metals with a large and negative real part and a small imaginary part of dielectric permittivity, usually gold and silver, are required for efficient enhancement, and suitable surfaces for plasmon excitation include colloids, roughened and patterned films, and self-assembled structures. SERS is emerging as a competitor to fluorescence with the benefit that no tagging is required (although surface-enhanced resonance Raman (SERRS) may employ a tag) and Raman spectra show narrow lines characteristic of the material, allowing greater multiplexing. However, its application to microfluidic devices is complicated as, unlike fluorescence, the species under detection must be in close proximity to the metal surface for enhancement to take place. Reliable quantitative measurements are difficult to achieve as SERS enhancement is strongly dependent on the shape, size, and proximity of metallic features. For example, colloids are attractive enhancers in microfluidic systems as they may be analysed while flowing through the system and do not use a fixed surface within the flow channel which may become fouled. The highest enhancements using colloids occur in \u201chot-spots\u201d where two particles are within a few nanometres of each other. Adequate control of measurement conditions such as the degree of colloid aggregation, particle sizes of the colloids, and the inhomogeneous distribution of molecules on a metal surface is challenging. Using a fixed patterned surface within the microflow channel has the advantage of providing a constant surface, with the disadvantage of its potential fouling and degradation.",

Crystal violet detections within the 60\u2013180 nl droplets were performed in a concentration range of 10\u22125\u201310\u22126 M, and quantification achieved by recording the amplitude of the 1177 cm\u22121 Raman peak.",

One device was used to detect cyanide anions for pollution monitoring using a Raman peak at 2100 cm\u22121, achieving an LoD of 1.0 ppb or below (Yea et al. 2005). Using similar devices this group also reported (1) detection of two different dye-labelled DNA nucleotides without the need for PCR or microspotting; TAMRA and Cy3 dyes were used for labelling with an LoD estimated at 10\u221211 M (Park et al. 2005), and (2) the detection of methyl parathion insecticide with an LoD of 0.1 ppm (Lee et al. 2006). Recently, again using a similar device, molecular beacons were used to hybridise with the target DNA and detected using fluorescence and SERS. In the case of the SERS measurements, silver colloids were mixed with the beacon solution and the DNA to be hybridised was added through another inlet. The Raman signal was strongly reduced if the analyte was complementary to the beacon as the change in conformation of the beacon caused the SERS-active labels to be separated from the colloid (Jung et al. 2007b).",

Laser tweezer Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) exploits a single-beam optical gradient trap to hold and isolate a particle while performing Raman spectroscopy upon it. Such trapping applies to larger objects such as cells, where detection of Raman scattering is less problematic, and has the advantages that the object can be held away from surroundings, to limit background interferences, can be held stationary for extended periods and then released, to allow temporal integration of spectra and improved signal to noise ratio, and can be moved in and out of the Raman probe volume, to allow background subtraction and noise reduction. The optical gradient trap has been employed for some time to study Raman spectra of levitated objects (Thurn and Kiefer 1984). However, it is only recently that LTRS has been used in conjunction with microfluidics. Xie et al. (2005) fabricated a simple microfluidic system with two microfluidic chambers joined by a microchannel. Individual yeast cells and bacteria were trapped and identified from their Raman spectra in one chamber and then moved to separate regions in the collection chamber for subsequent processing using the tweezer.",

The use of separate wavelengths for trapping and Raman scattering adds an extra dimension to LTRS systems. Creely et al. (2005) realised a macrofluidic dual-wavelength LTRS system with excitation of the Raman spectra at 785 nm, and trapping at 1,064 nm. Individual living yeast cells were trapped, a Raman spectrum obtained for between 0.2 and 180 s, moved out of the Raman excitation beam so that a background measurement could be acquired under the same experimental conditions, and then the spectrum had the background subtracted. The approach employed a single microscope system using an excitation power and trapping power both <10 mW, allowing live cells to be observed for over 2 h, and detailed information on temporal changes in the cells to be obtained. Recently Rusciano et al. (2006) have demonstrated a dual-beam microfluidic system, where the Raman probe beam is kept in a fixed position whilst the trapping beam position oscillates so that the trapped object is moved through the Raman probe volume twice in each period of oscillation, thereby modulating the Raman signal by a frequency 2f. This can then be demodulated with low noise using a lock-in amplifier, removing any stray light or unmodulated background fluorescence. The resultant signal includes a spurious component also modulated by 2f due to the photon scattering of the solvent volume. However, this second component is easily distinguished as it is shifted by \u03c0/2 radians with respect to the desired signal.",

This heat changes the refractive index of the medium, usually lowering it. If a laser excitation beam is focussed on a small volume, the refractive index change is increased and a thermal lens (TL) is created by the thermal gradient. A laser probe beam can then be used to detect these changes. A thermal lens microscope (TLM) exploits this phenomenon by focussing a coaxial excitation beam and probe beam on the fluid through an objective lens, and detecting the power in the probe beam passing through a pinhole after filtering out the excitation wavelength, as shown for nanoparticle detection in Fig. 20. A modulated excitation laser and synchronous detection is used to reduce noise and improve detection limit. Sensitivity to absorption is extremely high, as is required in microfluidic systems with small volumes, but TL is generally not able to distinguish between absorbing species, although thermal lens spectroscopy yields some compositional information. Kitamori et al. (2004), writing on the principles of TLM and its application to imaging and microfluidics, observe that the chemical specificity obtainable through separation of analyte species in microfluidics is complemented by the great sensitivity of thermal lens detection. Further miniaturisation of the TLM is required for practical use in microfluidic systems as the optics used tends to be quite bulky.\n\n",

A three-dimensional microchannel network on chip with pressure-driven flow that produced multi-phase laminar flows was able to perform 20 micro operations such as mixing and liquid\u2013liquid extraction. The device was used to extract and analyse Fe(II) and Co(II) ions using changes in absorption spectrum (Kikutani et al. 2004). A simpler device which also makes use of multi-phased flows demonstrated an LoD of 7 \u00d7 10\u22128 M for carbaryl pesticide, two orders of magnitude lower than conventional spectrophotometric methods for (Smirnova et al. 2006). These systems employed single wavelength excitation at 532 nm and detection at 633 nm. A tunable thermal lens spectrometer system using a Xe lamp and monochromator as excitation source (Tamaki et al. 2005) enabled determination of the thermal lens spectrum of non-scattering and turbid solutions, demonstrating a clear advantage over absorption detection by measuring the spectrum largely regardless of the strong light scattering background. The thermal gradient required for thermal lensing was obtained by exploiting rapid thermal conduction between the glass substrate and the liquid, rather than by tight focussing of the excitation beam. Application to cultured cells was demonstrated (Goto et al. 2005) by monitoring nitric oxide release from macrophage-like cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide using a colorimetric reaction in a microfluidic device with localized temperature control. A successful assay was achieved within 4 h using 3,000 cells compared to 24 h and 105\u2013106 cells for conventional batch methods. UV excitation TLM at 266 nm was employed for detection of adenine aqueous solutions without labelling in a fused-silica microchip. The sensitivity obtained was 350 times higher than a conventional spectrophotometric method with an LoD of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 M (Hiki et al. 2006). Detection of single and multiple 50 nm gold nanoparticles was demonstrated using TLM, as shown in Fig. 20 and their optically driven fixation to the wall of the glass microchannel using the same beam was also demonstrated, having the potential for sensitive nanoparticles detection and production of microchip SERS substrates (Mawatari et al. 2006). A glass microchip consisting of a microchamber for cell culture connected to a microchannel for TLM detection was used to monitor intercellular messengers (Sato et al. 2006). Rat hippocampus nerve cells were cultured in the microchamber to form a neural network, and the retrograde messenger was then detected in the microchannel. Chirality of low-volume liquid samples was measured in a microfluidic device by using TLM in which the handedness of circularly polarised excitation light was modulated (Yamauchi et al. 2006a). Left- and right-circularly polarized light may be absorbed differentially in a chiral medium, and this is detected as a modulation of the detected TLM signal. Miniaturised thermal lens systems have been realised utilizing, for example, optical fibres, fibre wavelength multiplexer for the two diode laser sources (658 nm excitation and 785 nm probe) and SELFOC microlenses. LoDs of 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 M for sunset yellow and 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 M for nickel (II) phthalocyanine-tetrasulfonic acid, tetrasodium salt (NiP) were achieved, showing a rather small reduction in performance compared with the conventional bulk-optical detection system (Tokeshi et al. 2005). Employing both TLM detection and fluorescence in a microfluidic device with similar miniaturised optics yielded an LoD 6.3 nM for (NiP) and 3 nM for Cy5 (Yamauchi et al. 2006b).",

(2006) realised a semi-automated heterogeneous immunoassay system for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), using TLM to detect BNP within a concentration range of 0.1\u2013100 pg ml\u22121 through reaction resulting in a blue-coloured product. Kitagawa et al. (2006) used CE separation in fused silica capillaries connected to a microchannel on a chip. The system achieved an LoD of 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 M for the azo dye, Sudan Red, more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional absorbance detection. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography with sample concentration by \u201csweeping\u201d (Quirino and Terabe 1998) reduced the LoD to 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221212 M. Mawatari et al. (2005) used the sensitivity of the TLM signal to focusing position to optimise precise focusing in a portable TL apparatus, in a manner similar to the optical disk drive, using a micro-optical pick-up unit rather than a microscope. Adjustments of the depth were made by determination of the astigmatism of the reflected excitation beam, and the width by monitoring transmitted scattered light of the probe beam. An LoD of 30 nM was achieved for xylene cyanol solution, with a sensitivity between 20 and 100 times higher than that obtained by spectrophotometry. This laboratory then presented a similar miniaturised TLM system, but with reflective rather than transmissive optics, shown in Fig. 21, reducing alignment complexity, and only requiring optical access from one side of the microfluidic chip. This was achieved by forming an aluminium mirror on the reverse of the microchip. The reflected probe beam was detected with 40 times higher sensitivity when compared to a spectrophotometer, with an LoD of 60 nM for xylene cyanol solution (Mawatari and Shimoide 2006).\n\n",

While optical telecommunications benefited from needing large numbers of devices providing a few very well defined functions, optical sensing must satisfy many very diverse applications so that the optical phenomenon to be probed and the required sensitivity, specificity, speed and cost may require a different technological solution for each application (Culshaw 2004). The challenge is greater in microfluidic systems where the sample volumes and optical path-lengths are small, though this also provides advantages for single molecule or single cell analysis. Most present systems rely upon bulk-optical systems external to the fluidic chip, such as confocal microscopes, which render portable miniaturised systems difficult to realise, although this approach does have the advantage of easy reconfigurability of the optical system.",

            "text": "Scattering has been used to yield size and shape information on cells in flow cytometry and it is expected that further advances in interrogation of scattering distributions, perhaps combined with fluorimetry, will generate powerful new automated cell recognition and sorting systems. Detection through optical absorption is common in macro-fluidic chemical analysis, often not requiring labelling; however, the short path length leads to poor detectability and a variety of approaches are being adopted to enhance absorption through using a variety of \u201cmultipass\u201d systems and sample concentration steps. Thermal lensing is advancing fast as an extremely sensitive method of performing absorption-dependent assays not requiring long path lengths. Fluorescent detection, while usually requiring labelling, is so sensitive and has achieved such wide acceptance that it is by far the most dominant technique. The trends here are in moving to more stable tags such as quantum dots, and longer wavelength semiconductor sources for compactness, low cost and reduced background fluorescence. Improvements are also being made in geometrical configuration by incorporating multiple parallel channels, optimising fluorescence collection angle and realising compact multiwavelength chip interrogation units. Refractive index measurement is being exploited in Fabry\u2013Perot etalon cavities for cell analysis and in evanescent approaches such as integrating dielectric waveguides or metal films supporting surface plasma waves within microchannels. These techniques do not require the use of labels and therefore need careful referencing or integration in separation systems to reduce the potential for non-specific interferences. Nonetheless the ease of mass-production of the evanescent devices using conventional microelectronics processing renders them particularly attractive for fully integrated systems. Raman spectroscopy is gaining ground in direct label-free detection and identification of species. Normally, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy must be used to obtain sufficient signal, and this either uses nanostructured metal films on the walls of the fluidic channels, which can degrade or become blocked, or metallic nanoparticles added to the fluid to be analysed, which then flow out of the detection region with the sample after analysis. Laser-tweezer Raman spectroscopy may be used to trap and analyse larger objects such as cells without enhancement, or for species attached to enhancing beads, with the advantages that signal integration times can be long and an object can be held away from any interfering surface.",

            "text": "Optical trapping, manipulation and sorting, which extend the well-known optical tweezer technique, are growing in appeal, often as complements to hydrodynamic or electrokinetic approaches. Optical sorting of particles such as cells has been carried out in several different implementations by using forces dependent on the optical characteristics of the particles to modify their velocity in a flowing liquid in a novel form of chromatography. Alternatively, arrays of optical traps have been used to capture particles and release them at will; concurrent optical detection may activate the release in miniaturised versions of fluorescence-activated cell-sorters, for example. In addition to long-term trapping of cells or beads for low-noise Raman detection, optical traps have been used for other measurements on individual cells, including cell rigidity. Rather than tightly focussed single-beam traps, opposing dual-beam traps show advantages for these applications as they are more suited to large objects and, using lower intensities, are less likely to cause cell damage. Not requiring lenses, these traps are particularly simple to implement monolithically with photolithographically positioned integrated lasers or waveguides. For two-dimensional sorting in a fluidic plane, the optical potential landscape produced by interference or other patterning of a two-dimensional array of optical traps provides a particularly elegant and flexible means of separation. Evanescent techniques, where a prism or waveguide is used to generate propulsion and trapping optical forces close to a surface, have been employed for sorting, guiding and separation at a surface. This approach has the advantage that the optical path does not pass through the bulk of the sample and that the intensity distribution at the surface may be very precisely controlled. However, the optical fields only reach a few hundred nanometres into the sample, so objects to be manipulated must be very close to the surface. A wide variety of optically driven micropumps have been realised, having fewer constraints on liquid medium than electrokinetic pumps, and flexible external control of the impellors without direct electrical connection to the microfluidic chip. In some cases the micropumps are completely optically configured within the channel by collecting and controlling the motion of beads, yielding great flexibility in configuration.",

The vast majority of optical functions are still carried out with bulky external optics, but it is envisaged that with closer collaboration between the optics, biosensor and microsystems communities, low-cost mass-produced integrated systems will emerge. In the sort term, further integration of optical functions will render the LoC more costly and less flexible, but the example of the microelectronics industry shows that mass-production will ultimately bring these costs down and allow widespread use of optically integrated microsystems, if further standardisation of protocols and commonality of technological platforms can be achieved.",
