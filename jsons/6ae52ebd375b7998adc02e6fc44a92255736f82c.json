The care to have the least in-person contact between people to prevent the spread of the virus (self-quarantine), defended by international authorities, has made electronic consultations gain even more visibility [3, 4] . Besides helping patients to control chronic diseases and to give an early diagnosis, the telemedicine can \"forward triage\" people with possible symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This approach allows patients to be efficiently screened as well as avoid the spreading of the virus among patients, health professionals, and exposed community.",

Since no telemedicine program can be created suddenly, an alternative adopted by different patients is to use the instant messaging applications from social media. Mobile applications based on text messaging and images can be useful with instant communication and quick decisions. Even with some limitations, this alternative also helps people to rule out oral lesions, have an early diagnosis and correct follow-up. Similarly, such an alternative helps to rule out SARS-CoV-2 symptoms quickly and avoid long lines in hospitals and emergency care, which is really great to reduce the virus spreading.",

The dentist sent images and a brief description by WhatsApp (Fig. 1) . She was advised to order a blood examination due to suspected Idiopathic Purpura. The exam result showed severe thrombocytopenia, and the patient was referred to the hospital unity in order to be treated by the use of systemic steroids. The procedure had an outstanding response.",
