These results support the fetal programming hypothesis, which suggests that maternal environment during gestation can influence progeny postnatal growth and health (Barker et al., 1993) . Most studies concerning primiparous heifer prepartum nutrition focus on how nutritional treatments impact reproductive performance (Bellows et al., 1982 (Bellows et al., , 2001 Wiley et al., 1991; Lammoglia et al., 1997; Patterson et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2005; Engel et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2009 ABSTRACT: A 3-yr study using primiparous crossbred beef heifers (n = 114) was conducted to determine the effects of protein supplement during late gestation on progeny performance and carcass characteristics. Pregnant heifers were stratified by heifer development system, initial BW, and AI service sire and placed in an individual feeding system. Heifers were offered meadow hay (8 to 11% CP) from early November to mid-February and provided no supplement (CON; n = 37), 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried distillers grains with solubles-based supplement (HI; n = 39), or 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried corn gluten feed-based supplement (LO; n = 38). Supplements were designed to be isonitrogenous (28% CP) and isocaloric but to differ in RUP with HI (59% RUP) having greater levels of RUP than LO (34% RUP). After the individual feeding period, heifers were placed in a drylot for calving. All heifers were bred using a fixed-timed AI protocol and pairs were moved to a commercial ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills for summer grazing. Calf weaning BW did not differ (P = 0.14) based on maternal diet. However, feedlot entry BW was greater (P = 0.03) for HI compared with CON calves. Average daily gain during the initial feedlot phase tended (P = 0.10) to be greatest for calves born to CON dams and lowest for calves born to LO dams. However, overall ADG was similar (P = 0.50) for the entire feedlot period. Residual feed intake during the reimplant and total feeding period was improved in calves born to supplemented dams in yr 2 and 3 compared with calves born to CON dams. There was no difference in final BW among treatments (P = 0.71). Hot carcass weight was similar (P = 0.72) among treatments; however, steers had greater (P < 0.01) HCW than heifers. Furthermore, percent empty body fat and 12th rib fat thickness were lowest (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04) for calves born to LO dams. Tenderness measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force was increased (P = 0.03) in longissimus samples from calves from CON dams compared to calves from LO dams. Similarly, crude fat levels tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for calves from CON dams compared with calves from LO dams. Based on these data, providing RUP supplements, similar to those used in this study, to primiparous heifers in late gestation consuming ad libitum grass hay resulted in increased initial feedlot BW for HI compared to CON calves, improved feed efficiency, and altered carcass characteristics in calves born to supplemented compared with CON dams.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 162, "text": "(Stalker et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 163, "end": 186, "text": "(Stalker et al., , 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 187, "end": 207, "text": "Martin et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 208, "end": 231, "text": "Mulliniks et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 232, "end": 252, "text": "Larson et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 419, "end": 440, "text": "(Barker et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 574, "end": 595, "text": "(Bellows et al., 1982", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 596, "end": 619, "text": "(Bellows et al., , 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 620, "end": 639, "text": "Wiley et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 640, "end": 663, "text": "Lammoglia et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 664, "end": 687, "text": "Patterson et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 688, "end": 708, "text": "Martin et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 709, "end": 728, "text": "Engel et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 729, "end": 750, "text": "Sullivan et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "on subsequent progeny performance through weaning (Corah et al., 1975; Martin et al., 2005; Engel et al., 2008 ) Corah et al.

Maternal feed costs were reduced (P < 0.01) $27 and $24/cow for CON dams compared with LO and HI dams due to late gestation supplement costs. However, net return based on weaned calf value was not different (P = 0.23) among maternal treatments. Steer calves were valued $105 greater (P < 0.01) than heifer calves at weaning, resulting in an increased net return for steer calves if sold at weaning. Lack of statistical difference between treatments can be attributed to the tendency (P = 0.14) for calves from HI dams to be heavier at weaning compared to calves from CON dams. Feedlot purchase price tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for HI calves compared with CON calves due to the 16-kg difference (P = 0.03) in feedlot entry BW (Table 3) . These data are similar to Larson et al. (2009) , who also report an increase in feedlot purchase cost for calves born to protein supplemented dams. Feedlot costs are $10 and $11/calf greater (P = 0.01) for CON-born calves compared with HI-and LO-born calves, respectively. Increased costs are attributed to increased feed costs, which result from numerical increases in DMI reported in calves from CON dams (Table 3) . Adjusted carcass value and net returns during the feedlot phase did not differ (P \u2265 0.82) based on maternal treatment. These data differ from both Stalker et al. (2006) and Larson et al. (2009) , who reported increased net returns for calves retained from protein-supplemented cows. Whereas Stalker et al. (2006) reported negligible increases in net difference per steer ($0.65/animal), the authors do report an increase in net returns, which can be attributed to increased numbers of calves weaned from protein- supplemented dams (Stalker et al., 2006) . Larson et al. (2009) reported a $47/steer increase in net returns for calves from protein-supplemented dams, attributed to an increased proportion of calves grading USDA Choice and increased HCW (Larson et al., 2009) . Findings in the current study differ from previously reported data for late gestation protein supplementation of multiparous cows. Studies conducted by Stalker et al. (2006 Stalker et al. ( , 2007 , Martin et al. (2007) , Larson et al. (2009), and Funston et al. (2010) used mature cows grazing winter range or corn residue, with maternal supplementation provided during late gestation. The stage of gestation in which supplementation occurred was similar to the time of supplementation in the current study. However, differences in calf performance and carcass characteristics could likely be related to control diet quality in those studies compared with the current study. The current study offered CON heifers ad libitum grass hay. As previously reported, this diet was not deficient in energy, MP, or RDP (Summers et al., 2015) . Grazing cattle on dormant winter range does not meet the MP requirement for late gestating cattle; therefore, the nonsupplemented dams in the previous studies would have been in a negative energy balance, unlike CON heifers in the current study. It is possible that reducing CON heifer intake to create a negative nutrient balance, similar to that previously observed by our group in multiparous cow studies (Stalker et al., 2006 (Stalker et al., , 2007 Larson et al., 2009; Funston et al., 2010) , would result in a greater fetal programming effect. Although calves from HI dams had greater initial feedlot BW compared to calves from CON dams and feedlot production and carcass characteristics were impacted by maternal nutrition, then additional research is warranted to determine the effects differing RUP supplements may have on primiparous heifers grazing low quality forages during late gestation.
