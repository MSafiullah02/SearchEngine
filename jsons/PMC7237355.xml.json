This information was obtained by use of social media and online educational materials, as well as by contacting 100% of their IBD population.",

These methods can result in rapid development of virtual telephone clinics, but they still ultimately require people to run them. The UK and other countries should therefore urgently seek to improve their IBD digital resources and staff resources to potentially reduce the burden of further waves of COVID-19.",

BSG guidance suggests that patients should continue on their current medications, including infliximab, as active disease remains the biggest risk to a patient with IBD.4 Furthermore, the use of thalidomide for patients with IBD in the UK is uncommon, with a systematic review highlighting that there is insufficient evidence for its use in IBD and that it is potentially associated with adverse effects.5 It would therefore be of interest to see the long-term implications of this practice to guide future health-care systems in their approach to their patients with IBD at risk from COVID-19.",
