The spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV ranges from odynophagia and dysphagia, to nausea and vomiting, to abdominal pain and fi nally diarrhea and tenesmus. As with normal hosts, gastrointestinal disorders are very common in HIV patients, whether it be from opportunistic infections secondary to the patient's immunosuppressed status, medication induced, or through other etiologies. Almost all HIV and AIDS patients have some gastrointestinal complaints throughout the course of their illness. With the dramatic changes in HIV care because of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the mid-1990s, the incidence of opportunistic infections are decreasing, and as a result, the clinical picture of gastrointestinal illnesses in HIV is changing. The evaluation of the HIV patient with gastrointestinal complaints requires a thorough history and physical exam, in addition to selected studies, in order to diagnose the correct disease and treat accordingly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Patients with HIV and AIDS typically can have upper gastrointestinal symptoms, which can range from dysphagia, or diffi culty swallowing, to odynophagia, or the feeling of pain upon swallowing. At least one-third of patients with HIV before the ART era had esophageal complaints, 1 and the incidence increased with the progression of the disease. Most of the symptoms in these patients are secondary to opportunistic infections caused by the patient's immunosuppressed state, and related to the degree of immunosuppression. The most common etiologies of esophageal pathology and esophagitis in AIDS patients (Table 23 .1) are Candida species, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). 2 In addition, there is also an entity of idiopathic esophageal ulcers (IEU) that is also seen in HIV patients, which may be immunologically mediated, 3 or caused by HIV itself. 4 Other etiologies of esophageal complaints include malignancy (especially lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma) and other noninfectious causes. However, with the introduction of protease inhibitors (PIs) in 1996 and ART, and the decreased incidence of AIDS, more esophageal complaints in HIV these days are related to common etiologies like gastroesophageal refl ux disease (GERD) than opportunistic infections. 5 In addition to the most common symptoms of dysphagia and odynophagia, other symptoms can also suggest esophageal disease in HIV patients, like chest pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. The symptoms can be acute or have a more chronic, progressive course. In addition, dysphagia is often associated with candidal esophagitis, whereas odynophagia is generally symptomatic of esophageal ulcerative disease. Patients can have both dysphagia and odynophagia, and because they also may have more than one illness concurrently, it is imperative to pursue a thorough investigation as to the etiology of esophageal complaints in HIV patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 698, "end": 699, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 849, "end": 850, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 876, "end": 877, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1283, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 608, "end": 617, "text": "(Table 23", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Esophageal Disorders"}, {"text": "The evaluation of HIV patients with esophageal symptoms does not defi nitively need to include endoscopy with biopsy, but this is the gold standard, as it allows the physician to visualize the esophageal lumen, and to biopsy affected sites ( Fig. 23.1) .

In addition, patients with disseminated CMV (e.g. CMV retinitis) with esophageal symptoms (especially odynophagia) may respond to CMV antiviral therapy in the absence of diagnostic endoscopy and biopsy. The most common sign on physical exam that relates to esophageal complaints is oral thrush, which can be suggestive of esophageal candidiasis in patients with esophageal complaints. In these patients, especially those with only dysphagia (or dysphagia and odynophagia, but not those with solely odynophagia) it may be benefi cial to document the response from an empiric trial of oral fl uconazole, as opposed to endoscopy. 6 If there is a symptomatic response to the fl uconazole, then it can be presumed the patient had candidal esophagitis and proceed accordingly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1004, "end": 1005, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 252, "text": "Fig. 23.1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Esophageal Disorders"}, {"text": "In addition to history and physical exam, there are other ways to evaluate esophageal complaints. Barium esophagography is relatively insensitive and non-specifi c and should not be used for diagnostic purposes, but the most characteristic fi nding in candidal esophagitis is diffuse mucosal irregularity resulting in a 'shaggy' appearance mimicking diffuse ulceration. 7 CMV and IEU may appear as well circumscribed ulcers that may be shallow or deep, and are indistinguishable on barium swallow. 8 Of course, radiography can determine a neoplastic origin to dysphagia in patients with malignancies. Another form of evaluation is brush cytology, where a cytology brush is passed through a nasogastric tube and obtains tissue for viral cultures and immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, this leads to large sampling error, because it is done blindly without visualization of the lumen, and misses diagnoses (as patients may have two infectious processes, and IEU cannot be diagnosed). Viral culture and cytologic brushings add little in the evaluation of AIDS patients with esophagitis over endoscopy with biopsy. 9 Endoscopy with biopsy generally yields a viral or fungal diagnosis based on culture and hematoxylin and eosin staining (which will exclude a viral etiology); only after several biopsy samples do not show any etiology of the ulcerations can a tentative, exclusionary diagnosis of IEU be made. Candidal esophagitis is the most common cause of esophagitis in HIV patients, especially in patients with complaints of dysphagia, or odynophagia and dysphagia. 10 The fungal isolate is generally Candida albicans, though other species of Candida can also affect the esophagus. It should be suspected in patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count of <100 cells/mm 3 (though can occur at any CD4+ count), and esophageal symptoms with or without thrush, which can be absent in 30% of patients. 11 In patients with HIV and new onset symptoms, an empiric trial of standard dosed fl uconazole is an effective strategy, as 82% of patients in a prospective study responded. If there is no response, endoscopy can be pursued. 6 In patients that fail empiric antifungal therapy, the most common etiology (in 77% of the patients) is ulcerative esophagitis as opposed to persistent candidiasis. 12 Fluconazole is the drug of choice for candidiasis, with a loading dose of 200 mg orally followed by 100 mg daily from 10-14 days. Clotrimazole troches are also successful, as topical treatment of esophageal candidiasis, 13 but nystatin is not. 14 Itraconazole and ketoconazole are effi cacious systemic therapies, but not as effective as fl uconazole. 15, 16 Amphotericin B is also a helpful therapy, but is generally used only in azole-resistant patients because of the toxicity of the medication. Low-dose amphotericin (0.3-0.5 mg/kg per day for 7-14 days) is usually adequate. Caspofungin can also be used in candidal esophagitis, and is felt to be as effi cacious as fl uconazole and well tolerated. 17 However, it is only available in intravenous form and is more expensive, but may be the drug of choice for azoleresistant mucosal candidiasis because of the relative lack of toxicity compared with amphotericin B. Primary prophylaxis of candidal disease is not recommended because of the non-life-threatening nature of the disease, the effectiveness of acute therapy, and the risk of antifungal resistance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 371, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 498, "end": 499, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1114, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1570, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1895, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2120, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2287, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2643, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2644, "end": 2646, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2992, "end": 2994, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Esophageal Disorders"}, {"text": "While Candida is the most common esophageal pathogen, it can also occur in addition to ulcerative esophagitis in HIV patients. CMV esophagitis is the most common etiology of odynophagia in HIV patients and therefore esophageal ulcerations, up to 45% of patients in one prospective study. 18 Fever and substernal chest pain can be reported in addition to odynophagia, and thrush can be concomitant, but dysphagia is very uncommon. The diagnosis of CMV is best made by endoscopy and biopsy, with the pathology showing viral cytopathic effect in the gastrointestinal mucosa via intranuclear inclusions. Immunohistochemistry is also helpful for confi rmation, as viral cultures are less sensitive and specifi c. 19 CMV is the most common viral pathogen in the esophagus in HIV patients, and esophagitis is the most common extraocular manifestation of CMV. 20 It can appear as a diffuse esophagitis, single or multiple ulcers, or giant ulcers involving the whole esophagus, and generally occurs when the CD4+ lymphocyte count is <50. It may be discovered only after treatment for Candida, as they may exist concurrently in 20% of patients. 21 The incidence of CMV esophagitis has declined dramatically in the ART era. Treatment for CMV esophagitis involves a wide array of antiviral medications, namely ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Ganciclovir was the fi rst agent used to combat CMV and has the most data behind it; the response rate is about 70-80%. It is given intravenously in a 2-4 week induction period, 5-10 mg/kg per day, but has dose limiting side-effects, mainly bone marrow suppression (and resultant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). Oral ganciclovir can also be used as maintenance therapy, but the data is limited. Intravenous foscarnet (90 mg/kg b.i.d., 2-3 weeks) is seen as equally effective to intravenous ganciclovir in the treatment of CMV esophagitis, but comes with a nephrotoxic side-effect profi le; however, randomized studies have shown equal effi cacy and safety. 22 Foscarnet is generally used in cases of clinical failure after ganciclovir induction. 23 Oral valganciclovir (900 mg/ day) has not been tested in CMV esophagitis, but does have 60% of the bioavailability of intravenous ganciclovir.

There is a form of HIV neuropathy that could lead to gastrointestinal complaints, like gastroparesis. These would be treated symptomatically, with prokinetic agents like metoclopramide.

As with esophageal disease, the incidence of opportunistic infections has decreased in the ART era, though the incidence of chronic diarrhea has remained steady even in the ART era. 29 The evaluation of diarrhea includes a thorough history and physical, as much can be determined from just eliciting the patient's history of symptoms. If the diarrhea occurs with upper abdominal cramps, or bloating, this suggests an upper intestinal source, or enteritis. Bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and lower abdominal cramping imply colonic involvement. In addition, patients with a history of receptive anal intercourse have a higher involvement of colitis and sexually transmitted pathogens (e.g. gonorrhea, HSV, etc.) in the anorectal area. Homosexual or bisexual men have a 3-fold higher incidence of diarrhea than patients in other risk groups.

In addition, a gram stain or methylene blue stain for fecal leukocytes can also be helpful, as evidence of fecal leukocytes may point towards a picture of colitis. Another form of non-invasive testing is blood cultures and serologies, which can be helpful for the diagnosis of systemic opportunistic infections like Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) or viral etiologies like CMV. Especially in the patients who have diarrhea and fever, MAI may be a possibility. However, with all of these etiologies, a diagnosis may be treated, and symptoms may still persist as secondary infections may also be present.

Abnormal tissue should be biopsied, but if the mucosa is normal then random tissue can be sent. The fl exible sigmoidoscopy is better than the alternatives as it does not require sedation. If small intestinal etiology is suspected, an EGD (going past the second portion of the duodenum) can help determine the cause of the diarrhea through biopsies of the small bowel, sent not only for pathology, but also electron microscopy and culture analysis. If the fl exible sigmoidoscopy is nondiagnostic, and there is still no diagnosis from other studies, a colonoscopy can be performed so more biopsies can be done to rule out opportunistic infections, especially in the ileum.

Parasites are typically diagnosed through stool analysis for ova and parasites, including direct fl uorescent antibody (DFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Light microscopy can be used, though PCR can be diagnostic at much lower levels of parasitic infection. Cryptosporidium parvum is the most commonly identifi able pathogen in AIDS related persistent diarrhea, especially in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts <200. It is typically treated with paromomycin 1500-3000 mg every 6-8 h orally, or Azithromycin 900-1200 mg four times a day, though albendazole 400 mg twice a day has also shown to be effective. Nitazoxanide (1 g twice daily for at least 2 weeks) can also be used in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, but a cure is generally not possible if the CD4+ lymphocyte count is <50. However, a study with children showed no benefi t to nitazoxanide at all in HIV+ children (just HIV seronegative ones). 30 Hyperimmune bovine colostrums can also be used, but typically not to cure the parasitic infection. 31 Microsporidiosis is the next most commonly identifi able refractory diarrhea in HIV patients. This can be treated with albendazole as well (400-1600 mg every 12 h orally) but most cases are poorly responsive to treatment and require indefi nite therapy. Isospora belli is rare in the USA, but is more common in developing countries. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one double strength tablet every 6 h for 10 days is the treatment of choice, but pyrimethamine 50-75 mg four times daily (with folinic acid 5 mg orally four times daily) is acceptable for patients with allergies to sulfa medications. 32 Lastly, Giardia lamblia and amoebic dysentery can also occur in HIV patients, at the same incidence as the general population, and can be treated with metronidazole 750 mg thrice daily for 5-10 days, or tinidazole 2 g orally once for giardiasis, 3 days for amebic dysentery. 30 For strongyloidosis, thiabendazole 25 mg/kg twice daily orally is the drug of choice.
