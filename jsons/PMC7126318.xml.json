Immunological memory forms the basis for prophylactic vaccination and is generally believed to be maintained by long living memory cells (Zinkernagel et al., 1996). Many aspects of immunological memory are still poorly understood. Recently, even the very existence of immunological memory has been questioned and the memory phenomenon is attributed to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and activated T cells (Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 2006). However, the mechanisms which keep the neutralizing antibodies and pre-activated T cells at a reasonable level in the body to be effective long after primary infection or vaccination are not yet well defined.",

Rinderpest virus, belonging to morbillivirus family of Paramyxoviridae, is antigenically closely related to Measles virus. H protein is a protective antigen of the virus and is one of the envelope glycoproteins. We have previously produced and characterized an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (Ab2) D9D8 (Vani et al., 2007a) generated using a monoclonal antibody A12A9 (Ab1) specific for H protein (Mitra-Kaushik et al., 2001). D9D8 behaves as an \u2018internal image\u2019 of H protein as shown by its ability to induce anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3) in mice and rats (Vani et al., 2007a). It has also been shown to mimic H protein in terms of both B and T cell responses (Vani et al., 2007a) suggesting that besides the functional homology, a structural homology may be underlying the Ab1 defined H-epitope mimicry by the Ab2 D9D8. In the variable regions of D9D8, regions with primary sequence similarity with the epitope on H were detected. The epitope is also a region on the H protein that is conserved among other morbilliviruses. In the present study, we have investigated the structural basis of mimicry of the hemagglutinin protein by its anti-idiotypic antibody by homology modeling of the structure of H as well as that of variable regions of Ab2.",

The angles varied from 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 between the templates. The role of flexibility in antigen binding has been well recognized (Huber and Bennett, 1987), hence the need to explicitly consider this aspect in model building of the antibody molecule. For modeling the Fv fragment of Ab2, relative orientation of the chains in other crystal structures of antibodies was analyzed among the list of templates identified through sequence similarities. Conservation of interactions at the surface was analyzed in particular.

The sequence similarity of D9D8 VH and VL with each chain and the angles between the heavy and light chains are shown. (B) Interface residues in 32C2 and the corresponding residues in D9D8: 32C2 was chosen as a template to construct the D9D8\u2013Fv fragment comprising VH and VL, since the VH\u2013VL interface residues were more conserved between D9D8 and 32C2. The conserved residues between both have been displayed. The number in subscript denotes the position of the amino acid residues.",
