The contact interval from person i to person j is the time between the onset of infectiousness in i and infectious contact from i to j, where we define infectious contact as a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. We show that the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the contact interval cumulative hazard function when who-infects-whom is observed. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we average the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all transmission networks consistent with the observed data using an EM algorithm. This converges to a nonparametric MLE of the contact interval cumulative hazard function that we call the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate. We study the behavior of these methods in simulations and use them to analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. In an appendix, we show that these methods extend chain-binomial models to continuous time.",

If person i infects person j with a given disease, the generation interval is the time between the infection of i and the infection of j. The serial interval, which is often used as a proxy for the generation interval, is the time between the onset of symptoms in i and the onset of symptoms in j. Data from several recent and historical epidemics have been analyzed using methods based on generation or serial interval distributions, including the 1918 influenza (Mills et al., 2004) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) , pandemic influenza A(H1N1) McBryde et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009) , and avian influenza (Ferguson et al., 2005 (Ferguson et al., , 2006 .",

            "text": "Statistical methods for infectious disease data that use generation or serial interval distributions are based on the Lotka-Euler equation (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007) or a branching-process approximation to the early spread of disease (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004; White and Pagano, 2008) . In both of these approaches, epidemic spread is modeled as a process that creates a population rather than a process of percolation through an existing population. Thus, these methods fail to account for the effects of exposure to multiple infectors and ignore information contributed by uninfected person-time. Since they assume generation intervals are independent and identically distributed, they implicitly assume a constant latent period (infection to onset of infectiousness) and a constant infectious period. When serial intervals are used as a proxy for generation intervals, they implicitly assume that the incubation period (infection to onset of symptoms) is also constant. Kenah (2010) outlined an alternative analysis of epidemic data based on contact intervals. Informally, the contact interval from an infectious person i to a susceptible person j is the time between the onset of infectiousness in i and the first infectious contact from i to j, where we define infectious contact to be a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. The contact interval is similar to the generation interval, but it is defined for all possible infector-infectee pairs, not just those in which infection is actually transmitted, and it begins with the onset of infectiousness, not infection. The contact interval from i to j will be right-censored if j is infected by k = i prior to infectious contact from i or if i recovers before making infectious contact with j. This censoring is accounted for using methods from survival analysis. Statistical methods based on contact intervals avoid many of the problems with methods based on generation and serial intervals. They can incorporate a greater variety of transmission models, they use information contributed by uninfected person-time, and they allow clearer expression of analytical assumptions.",

            "text": "In epidemic modeling, it is common to specify infectious contact within an underlying contact process between individuals in the population. While a person i is infectious, he or she has some probability of transmitting infection to a susceptible person j each time a contact from i to j is made (e.g., Rhodes et al., 1996) . Models based on contact intervals define an infectious contact as a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual, ignore all contacts made by person i outside his or her infectious period, and ignore all infectious contacts from i to j after the first. This relaxes the assumption that the contact process is unaffected by infection and limits our attention to those contacts relevant to disease transmission. Any model specified in terms of an underlying contact process can be specified equivalently in terms of contact intervals. This paper outlines the nonparametric survival analysis of epidemic data based on contact intervals. The rest of Section 1 defines the general stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, describes our observed data, and reviews the parametric survival analysis of epidemic data. Section 2 shows that the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the cumulative hazard function of the contact interval distribution when who-infected-whom is observed. When who-infected-whom is not observed, the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all transmission networks consistent with the observed data are averaged to get a marginal Nelson-Aalen estimator. Since the transmission network probabilities are unknown, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to iteratively reweight the possible transmission networks, producing a series of marginal Nelson-Aalen estimates that converges to a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the contact interval cumulative hazard function. Section 3 explores the performance of these estimators in simulations. Section 4 uses them to analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Section 5 discusses the limitations, advantages, and future development of these methods. Appendix A shows how our methods can be used when who-infected-whom is partially observed, and Appendix B shows how our methods generalize chain-binomial models to continuous time.",

After 1,000 simulations, we calculated the coverage probability for each estimator at each quantile. For each coverage probability, we calculated an exact 95% confidence interval. All models had a latent period of zero and an exponential infectious period with mean one. The smoothing step of the EM algorithm was done via an inverse-variance weighted cubic smoothing spline with a smoothing parameter chosen by generalized cross-validation (Wegman and Wright, 1983) . Convergence of the EM algorithm was monitored by calculating the mean of the absolute values of the differences between the current and previous marginal Nelson-Aalen estimates at the 5 th , 10 th , 15 th ,. . . , 85 th , 90 th , and 95 th percentiles of the possible contact intervals.

The marginal Nelson-Aalen curve has much larger jumps on days 1, 2, and 3 following infection than on days 5 and 6, which places the highest infectiousness on the day prior to, the day of, and the day after the onset of symptoms.

The implicit assumption of constant latent, incubation, and infectious periods in methods based on generation and serial intervals was one of our main criticisms in Section 1. Unfortunately, our analysis merely made these same assumptions explicit. (d) We assumed that the contact interval distribution is identically distributed for all ordered pairs ij such that C ij = 1, which is unrealistic. For instance, age was found to have an effect on pH1N1 transmission in most of the papers cited in Section 4 France et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2010; Carcione et al., 2011; . The effects of covariates on the transmission of disease is a central concern of infectious disease epidemiology.",

This would yield a semiparametric estimator of the effects of covariates on infectiousness and susceptibility that is similar in spirit to the Cox proportional hazards model. In infectious disease epidemiology, these covariate effects are usually a higher priority than the distribution of infectiousness over time, so the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimator may find its most important applications behind the scenes of this regression model. Limitation (c) could be addressed by adopting a semiparametric Bayesian framework (Sinha and Dey, 1997) or using a profile sampler (Lee et al., 2005) . A semiparametric Bayesian approach would use a prior process instead of a marginal Nelson-Aalen estimator. A profile sampler would take advantage of the fact that the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate is an efficient numerical method of obtaining a likelihood maximized over all possible contact interval distributions for a given set of infection times, infectiousness onset times, and recovery times.",

The marginal Nelson-Aalen estimator combines these in a novel and useful way, correcting approaches based on generation and serial intervals, generalizing the chain binomial model, and pointing the way to more flexible and practical statistical methods for infectious disease epidemiology.
