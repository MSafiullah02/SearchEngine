Furthermore, a group of structurally unrelated intracellular DNA sensors has recently been identified, most prominently cGAS of the oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family and IFI16 of the PYRIN superfamily (reviewed in [4]). Besides their different subcellular localization, PRRs also recognize distinct PAMPs. Within the RLR family, RIG-I recognizes viral RNA that harbors short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stretches and a 5\u2032-triphosphate or 5\u2032-diphosphate moiety, while melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) detects longer dsRNA or viral RNA aggregates 1, 5. In vitro studies and studies in mice demonstrated that recognition of viral RNA PAMPs by RIG-I and MDA5 confers resistance to a wide spectrum of RNA viruses, including flaviviruses, influenza viruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and picornaviruses. In addition, RLRs are involved in detecting DNA virus infections, a mechanism that, in the case of RIG-I, relies on the recognition of RNA polymerase III-generated viral transcripts, at least for some DNA viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus).",

Although they recognize different ligands, RIG-I and MDA5 interact with a common adaptor protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (also known as IPS-1, CARDIF, or VISA) which serves as a scaffold for protein complex assembly at the mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) to trigger an antiviral program [6]. It has been demonstrated that the interaction of RIG-I with the chaperone protein 14-3-3\u025b mediates RIG-I translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria and MAMs to initiate signaling [7]. MAVS then recruits the IKK-related serine/threonine kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK\u025b, which phosphorylate and activate IRF3 or IRF7. Furthermore, the tripartite IKK\u03b1\u2013IKK\u03b2\u2013IKK\u03b3 complex is activated by MAVS, ultimately resulting in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation. NF-\u03baB and IRFs then translocate into the nucleus and cooperatively induce the gene expression of type I IFNs (IFN\u03b1 subtypes and IFN\u03b2), proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor superfamily proteins and interleukins) and chemokines, for the initiation of the antiviral response.",

Following recognition of viral dsDNA \u2013derived from either a DNA virus (e.g., herpesviruses) or retroviral infection \u2013 cytoplasmic cGAS catalyzes the formation of the second messenger cGAMP, which binds to and activates STING. The binding of cGAMP to STING results in the translocation of the adaptor protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and perinuclear sites. Activated STING dimerizes and binds to TBK1, resulting in IRF3 activation and IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 gene expression. The sensor IFI16 is reportedly localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and detects viral dsDNA via its hematopoietic expression, IFN-inducible nature, and nuclear localization (HIN) domain followed by signaling to STING to initiate an IFN-mediated antiviral response. In addition to its ability to elicit type I IFN induction, IFI16 also leads to IL-1\u03b2 secretion via activation of caspase 1-dependent inflammasomes (reviewed in [4]).",

            "text": "PTMs are key regulatory events in which proteins are enzymatically modified to reversibly modulate the activity, subcellular localization, conformation, and/or protein\u2013protein interactions of the target protein. Thus, PTMs are crucial for the dynamic regulation of signal transduction pathways. Each step of the intracellular pathogen sensing pathways is regulated by a complex network of PTMs resulting in a controlled yet effective antiviral cytokine response. In particular, ubiquitination (described in Box 1\n) and phosphorylation events are critical for fine-tuning the RLR-, cGAS-, and IFI16-mediated antiviral response.Box 1Protein Ubiquitination Types and Their FunctionsIn its simplest form, ubiquitin can be attached to the target protein as a single moiety, resulting in monoubiquitination, or multiubiquitination occurs if several monoubiquitin units are attached. Furthermore, ubiquitin itself can be ubiquitinated, resulting in the formation of ubiquitin chains attached to the target protein, and these oligo- or polyubiquitin moieties can be further subdivided into homotypic (single linkage type) or heterotypic (mixed linkage type) chains. Three enzymes, ubiquitin activating (E1), ubiquitin conjugating (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3), act sequentially to covalently attach ubiquitin to a substrate. In particular, substrate specificity is in large part directed by E3 ligases, and mammals encode hundreds of such ligases allowing for specific targeting of ubiquitin modifications. Protein ubiquitination has widespread implications in the regulation of cellular processes including protein processing and trafficking and signal transduction (reviewed in 72, 73).For polyubiquitination, it is the specific linkage type that determines the fate of the target protein. Polyubiquitin chains are formed when the C-terminal glycine of one ubiquitin molecule forms a covalent bond with one of the seven internal lysine residues of another ubiquitin molecule. This gives rise to seven different polyubiquitination linkage types: K6-, K11-, K27-, K29-, K33-, K48-, and K63-linked ubiquitination. In addition, M1 (or linear) polyubiquitin chains can be formed when the C terminus of one ubiquitin molecule binds to the N-terminal methionine of the other ubiquitin molecule. The first-identified and most well-characterized linkage type is K48-linked polyubiquitination, which primarily functions in proteasomal degradation of proteins. Other linkage types, such as K11- and K29-linked ubiquitin chains, can reportedly also function as marks to discard unwanted proteins via proteasomal degradation. K63-linked polyubiquitination modulates numerous cellular processes including autophagy, innate immunity, DNA repair, and endocytosis. Much less is understood about the function of other, noncanonical polyubiquitination types; however, recent studies suggested that they play a role in regulating diverse cell signaling pathways including NF-\u03baB activation, autophagy, and immunity (reviewed in [72]). For example, K6-linked polyubiquitin has been implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy. In addition to promoting proteolysis, K11-linked polyubiquitin chains regulate cell division and in mixed-linkage chains together with K63-linked ubiquitin trigger MHC I (major histocompatibility complex I) internalization. The role of K27-linked polyubiquitination remains largely enigmatic, while K33-linked chains have been implicated in post-Golgi membrane protein trafficking. Finally, M1-linked ubiquitination events are critical for the positive regulation of NF-\u03baB signal activation and inflammation 74, 75.",

            "text": "Other, less well-studied PTMs that modulate innate immunity are acetylation, glutamylation, and deamidation. Acetylation, a process catalyzed by acetyltransferases, results in the introduction of an acetyl group, typically on lysine residues. This modification occurs commonly in the proteome and plays an important role in numerous biological processes including cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodeling, and immunity. Glutamylation, which was first implicated in tubulin modification, is the addition of a glutamate to the \u03b3-carboxyl group of a glutamic acid in the target protein. Similar to ubiquitination the sequential addition of glutamates to the target protein can lead to a polyglutamate chain. Protein deamidation, the process in which an amide functional group is removed from the target protein (typically at an asparagine or glutamine residue), has been associated with protein degradation. However, recent studies also unveiled a role for deamidation in innate immune signaling. Protein ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, and glutamylation are reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs), phosphatases, deacetylases, and deglutamylases, respectively, allowing for tight regulation of pathogen sensing and immune signaling.",

            "text": "Recent studies demonstrated that RLR\u2013MAVS-dependent signal transduction is precisely controlled by several PTMs. Among them, reversible Ser/Thr phosphorylation and K63- and K48-linked polyubiquitination are critical \u2018on/off switch\u2019 signals to control proinflammatory cytokine induction triggered by RLRs (Figure 1\n). A key regulator of the RIG-I-mediated IFN response is the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM25, which modifies RIG-I with K63-linked polyubiquitination [11]. TRIM25 [also termed estrogen-responsive finger protein (Efp)] is a member of the TRIM family of RING E3 ligases, which are important regulators of PRR signaling pathways (Box 2\n). RIG-I ubiquitination by TRIM25 induces RIG-I oligomerization and its interaction with MAVS to induce antiviral gene expression. Following viral RNA binding and exposure of the tandem CARDs, TRIM25 is recruited to the first CARD of RIG-I and then attaches covalent K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to K172 in the second CARD 11, 12. Crystallization of the two CARD domains of RIG-I, referred to as RIG-I 2CARD, bound to K63-diubiquitin showed that the CARDs are stabilized into a tetrameric \u2018lock-washer\u2019 conformation in which three chains of K63-diubiquitin are bound along the outer rim of the helical trajectory to assemble a stable 2CARD tetramer [13]. In vitro cell-free experiments further showed that unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin generated by TRIM25 can also activate RIG-I by stabilizing the signaling-active RIG-I tetramer 13, 14, but further investigation is warranted to determine the role and contribution of unanchored K63-polyubiquitin to RIG-I activation in an infected cell. Recent studies also provided important insight into the activation mechanism of TRIM25: TRIM25 dimerization mediated by its RING and coiled-coil domains (CCD) assembles the catalytically active form of TRIM25 essential for RIG-I activation 15, 16.Box 2Regulation of Innate Immunity by TRIM E3 LigasesTRIM (tripartite motif) family proteins are characterized by the RBCC motif, which comprises an N-terminal RING (really interesting new gene) domain that confers E3 ligase enzymatic activity, one or two B-box domains of largely unknown function, and a central CCD that mediates homo- or hetero-oligomerization. In addition, most TRIM proteins have a unique C-terminal domain (e.g., a SPRY, PHD-Bromo, or ARF domain) that mediates specific protein\u2013protein interactions or has enzymatic activity 76, 77. Recent studies demonstrated that many of the \u223c80 human TRIM proteins are important regulators of PRR-mediated signal transduction and cytokine responses [78], with TRIM25 being the first TRIM protein identified that directly targets an innate immune sensor; namely, the intracellular viral RNA sensor RIG-I [11]. TRIM25 and several other TRIM proteins promote PRR signaling through catalysis of non-degradative polyubiquitin linkage types (e.g., K63- or K33-linked ubiquitination), which facilitates the multimerization, stabilization, and/or protein\u2013protein interactions of the target protein, ultimately enhancing its signal-transducing activity (reviewed in [79]). Some TRIM proteins also negatively regulate PRR-mediated cytokine induction; in these cases by mediating classical degradative K48-linked ubiquitination of substrate proteins and targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Besides their regulatory roles in innate signaling pathways, TRIM proteins act as antiviral restriction factors by directly targeting viral components 76, 77. For example, TRIM5\u03b1 targets the capsid of many retroviruses, including HIV-1, and TRIM19 [also known as promyelocytic leukemia (PML)] inhibits the replication of many RNA viruses and DNA viruses as part of PML nuclear bodies/ND10 compartments. Recent studies indicated that some TRIM proteins play dual roles by acting both as \u2018effectors\u2019 that neutralize viral infection and as \u2018sensors\u2019 that induce innate signal transduction. For example, TRIM21 recognizes antibody-opsonized virus particles leading to proteasomal degradation of the virus [80]. In addition, following recognition of the viral pathogen, TRIM21 initiates a signaling cascade that leads to NF-\u03baB activation and gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines [81]. Finally, some TRIM proteins regulate fundamental cellular processes such as gene transcription, the cell cycle, or autophagy that are associated with diverse pathological conditions (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders and cancer), but can also influence innate signaling and antiviral defense (reviewed in 82, 83).",

            "text": "Besides TRIM25, several other E3 ligases have been identified that modify RIG-I with K63-polyubiquitin chains, including Riplet/RNF135, TRIM4, and MEX3C. Furthermore, several host-encoded DUBs remove K63-linked polyubiquitin from RIG-I to balance proinflammatory responses (described in Table 1\n). The importance of covalent K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I for its activation is further supported by the finding that several viruses have evolved ways to inhibit the K63-polyubiquitin-dependent activation of RIG-I. These strategies can be grouped into two major categories: (i) viral targeting of the E3 ligases TRIM25 and Riplet; and (ii) virus-encoded DUBs that actively cleave the RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitin chains (described in more detail in Box 3\n).Box 3Viral Manipulation of PTMs to Dysregulate Innate SignalingThe essential role of PTMs in regulating PRR-mediated immunity is underscored by findings that many viral pathogens manipulate the PTMs of PRRs or their downstream signaling molecules for efficient virus replication (reviewed in detail in [84]). Several viruses target the ubiquitin E3 ligases TRIM25 and Riplet to block the K63-polyubiquitin-dependent activation of RIG-I. Influenza virus utilizes its non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which directly interacts with TRIM25 and Riplet thereby blocking the K63-ubiquitination of RIG-I 85, 86. The protease NS3/4A of HCV cleaves Riplet, thereby inhibiting RIG-I activation [59]. Dengue virus (DenV) blocks the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination in a viral protein-independent manner: the subgenomic RNA of an epidemic strain of DenV, termed \u2018sfRNA\u2019, binds to TRIM25 and interferes with its stabilization by USP15 [87]. Other viruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), foot-and-mouth disease virus, nairoviruses, and arteriviruses, encode DUBs to actively remove K63-polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I (reviewed in [84]). Measles and Nipah viruses, which are members of the Paramyxoviridae family, prevent the PP1\u03b1/\u03b3-dependent dephosphorylation of RLRs through two different mechanisms. The non-structural V protein from these viruses interacts with and sequesters PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 thereby inhibiting MDA5 S88 dephosphorylation and hence the activation of this receptor [88]. In dendritic cells, binding of measles virus to DC-SIGN prevents the assembly of an active PP1 complex thereby blocking both RIG-I and MDA5 dephosphorylation [89]. Another escape strategy of viruses is to induce the K48-linked ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of RLRs or downstream molecules. For example, Sendai virus and VSV upregulate the lectin family protein Siglec-G thereby promoting the interaction of the E3 ligase c-Cbl with RIG-I, inducing its degradation [90], while SARS-CoV usurps AIP4 to degrade MAVS [91].Analogous to the blocking of RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitination, several viral pathogens manipulate the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING to avoid recognition through intracellular DNA sensing pathways. For example, the polymerase of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the papain-like proteases of several coronaviruses bind to STING and prevent its K63-linked ubiquitination to evade antiviral immunity (reviewed in [84]). IFI16 signaling is antagonized by the pUL97 kinase of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [92]. pUL97 interacts with and phosphorylates IFI16 thereby inducing translocation of IFI16 from the nucleus, the site of sensing of HCMV DNA, to multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "While K63-linked ubiquitination leads to RIG-I activation following virus infection, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the CARD and CTD keeps RIG-I and also MDA5 in the signaling-repressed state in uninfected cells 19, 20, 21. RIG-I CARD phosphorylation at S8 and T170 induced by PKC\u03b1/\u03b2, and at S788 in the CTD mediated by casein kinase II (CKII), impedes RIG-I activation in uninfected cells 22, 23. Similarly, MDA5 phosphorylation at S88 (in the first CARD) and S828 (in the CTD), the latter mediated by RIO kinase 3 (RIOK3), keeps MDA5 inactive in uninfected cells 21, 24. Following viral infection, RIG-I and MDA5 form a complex with the phosphatase PP1\u03b1 or PP1\u03b3, which induces dephosphorylation of the RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs [21]. Biochemical studies showed that the dephosphorylated CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 have a high binding affinity for MAVS and efficiently trigger IFN induction 21, 22. Dephosphorylation is likely to induce a conformational change within the tandem CARDs allowing binding of effector proteins. In support of this, mutants of RIG-I in which S8 and T170 are mutated to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues strongly bind to TRIM25 and exhibit robust CARD ubiquitination; by contrast, phosphomimetic RIG-I CARD mutants had a low binding affinity for TRIM25 and were not efficiently modified with K63-linked polyubiquitin 19, 20, 22.",

            "text": "Recently, two independent studies demonstrated that RIG-I undergoes reversible acetylation, which regulates RIG-I-mediated immunity to RNA virus infection 34, 35. Acetylation of RIG-I at its CTD (with K909 as the primary acetylation site) inhibits the ability of RIG-I to sense viral RNA and form signaling-active homo-oligomers. Inversely, deacetylation of RIG-I by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) promotes RIG-I signaling and antiviral restriction, unveiling HDAC6 as an important upstream regulator of RIG-I. It is possible that acetylation of K909 affects specific hydrogen bonds formed between RIG-I and the 5\u2032-triphosphate group of RNA ligands thereby preventing RNA recognition by RIG-I. Conversely, binding of a ligand may facilitate the open RIG-I conformation, allowing HDAC6 binding and, ultimately, initiation of innate signaling. These studies also examined the role of HDAC6 in the antiviral response to RNA virus infection. Cells depleted of endogenous HDAC6 exhibited enhanced permissiveness for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or influenza virus and reduced innate immune responses. HDAC6-deficient mice exhibited more rapid onset of disease during acute infection with West Nile virus and greater replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) compared with wild-type mice.",

In this study the authors identified RIG-I as an interaction partner of the herpesviral glutamine amidotransferase (vGAT) by mass spectrometry. vGAT, which lacks intrinsic amidotransferase activity, recruits the cellular phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase (PFAS) and together the two proteins induce the deamidation of RIG-I at Q10, N245, and N445. Deamidation of RIG-I by the vGAT\u2013PFAS complex leads to the activation of RIG-I, which is likely to occur through a conformational change caused by the conversion of these neutral glutamine and asparagine residues to negatively charged glutamate or aspartate. Intriguingly, deamidation-mediated RIG-I activation is hijacked by herpesviruses to evade innate immunity. Viral pathogens also manipulate other PTMs in RIG-I and also MDA5 to dampen cell-intrinsic immunity (Box 3).",

The negative charge induced by phosphorylation allows MAVS to bind to a positively charged surface in IRF3, facilitating IRF3 recruitment and its activation by TBK1. Intriguingly, the phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism is also conserved in the innate adaptor proteins STING and TRIF, promoting cGAS- and TLR-mediated signaling [40].

Similarly to RLR regulation by kinase-dependent serine/threonine phosphorylation, which renders RIG-I and MDA5 inactive, phosphorylation of cGAS at S291 (mouse) or S305 (human) by the kinase Akt [also known as protein kinase B (PKB)] negatively impacts the antiviral immune response by suppressing cGAS enzymatic activity [43]. This phosphorylation-dependent dampening mechanism is usurped by viruses to inhibit IFN\u03b2-dependent antiviral responses. Specifically, infection by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) activates Akt leading to cGAS phosphorylation and inhibition. A phosphorylation-resistant cGAS mutant protein effectively promoted IFN\u03b2 production and restricted HSV-1 replication [43]. Furthermore, poly- and monoglutamylation of cGAS by tubulin tyrosine ligase-like enzyme (TTLL) 6 and 4, respectively, negatively regulates the cGAS-triggered antiviral response through distinct mechanisms: polyglutamylation of cGAS at E272 inhibits its DNA-binding capacity, whereas monoglutamylation at E302 prevents efficient synthase activity [44]. Conversely, the carboxypeptidases CCP5 and CCP6 perform nonredundant functions to remove the monoglutamate or polyglutamate moieties synthesized by TTLL4 and TTLL6, respectively.",

Overexpression of both of these E3 ligases enhanced STING-dependent IFN\u03b2 production while knockout of either abrogated cytokine responses. Thus, the relative contribution of TRIM32 and TRIM56 to STING activation, and whether the two enzymes act in concert or in a temporally distinct fashion, remains to be elucidated. Another atypical polyubiquitination type that positively regulates STING activity is K27-linked polyubiquitination catalyzed by the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) [49]. AMFR in complex with insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) modifies STING such that TBK1 is recruited. Conversely, STING signaling is dampened by RNF5, which modifies STING at K150 with K48-linked polyubiquitin, promoting STING degradation at the mitochondria during the course of viral infection [50]. RNF26 catalyzes K11-linked polyubiquitination of STING at the same residue, competing with RNF5 to ubiquitinate STING [51]. Thus, ubiquitination of K150 by RNF26 prevented the attachment of K48-polyubiquitin chains by RNF5 and thereby STING degradation.",
