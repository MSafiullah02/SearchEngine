Molecular techniques are used increasingly for the diagnosis of adenovirus and generally have the highest yield of the various diagnostic methods.27, 28 Unfortunately many respiratory virus multiplex panels have low yields for adenovirus in patients with clinical infection; this is especially true if respiratory samples are collected and the respiratory tract is not the primary site of infection.29 Quantitative PCR assays can be used to predict progression to disseminated disease in pediatric and, to a lesser extent, adult stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and to assess response to antiviral therapy.28, 30, 31, 32, 33\n",

Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a more serious disease with a much longer time to recovery. Following an 8\u201310 day incubation, a follicular conjunctivitis with edema of the eyelids, pain, lacrimation, photophobia, preauricular lymph node hypertrophy and, rarely, self-limited painful corneal opacities develop.45, 46 Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, typically caused by adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37, was first seen in shipyard workers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips of rust or paint. Although patients may experience significant pain and blurry vision, EKC typically resolves without permanent corneal damage over 4 weeks.47, 48\n",

Human coronaviruses (e.g. hCoV 229E, OC43, NL63) commonly cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, although occasionally result in more severe disease in immunocompromised individuals.77 However, two novel human coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and a recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may cause serious viral pneumonitis, leading to hospitalizations and deaths.78, 79, 289 Viral genome analyses revealed that SARS-CoV belongs to Group B and MERS-CoV belongs to Group C betacoronavirus, respectively, and both are closely related to coronavirus strains found in bats.78, 79, 80 Intermediate mammalian hosts, such as civet cats, have been implicated for SARS-CoV before its adaptation for human transmission, and emerging evidence (through virus or antibody detection) suggest that the dromedary camels are likely the host for MERS-CoV.78, 79, 81, 290 The surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) of coronaviruses is a key virulence factor which attaches the virus to host cells, determining its host range and tissue tropism, and it is a target of the neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-II) as the primary cellular receptor; the human cellular C-type lectin (DC/L-SIGN) may be the alternative.82 MERS-CoV has been shown to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4, (DPP4; also called CD26), an interspecies-conserved protein found on the surface of several cell types, including the non-ciliated cells in human airways, which can explain its broadened host range and its ability to cause cross-species, zoonotic transmission.83\n",

Drying up of a \u2018U-shaped\u2019 bathroom floor drain and backflow of contaminated sewage (from a SARS patient with diarrhea), coupled with the toilet's exhaust fan, might have created infectious aerosols that rose with warm air along the building's air-shaft; these were then dispersed by wind flow, causing long-range transmission to nearby buildings.90 This and other evidence suggested that SARS could be \u2018opportunistically\u2019 airborne.78, 89\n",

As of May 2015, a total of 1180 confirmed infections and 483 (41%) deaths had been reported.78, 91 The Middle Eastern countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and United Arab Emirates were predominantly affected, but imported cases to UK, Netherlands, USA and Asia were reported.91, 291 The largest outbreak outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015, which involved multiple hospitals and 185 individuals, causing 36 (19.5%) deaths. Although zoonotic transmission is implicated, the majority of infected cases did not report a history of direct animal contact. Epidemiological investigations suggested sporadic transmission of disease with multiple introductions into the at-risk population. It was found that occupational exposure to camels (e.g. shepherds, slaughter-house works) was associated with 15\u201323 times higher risk of seroconversion (2.3\u20133.6%) than the general population (<0.2%). Also, a large number of younger (15\u201344 years) infected individuals, who develop no or mild symptoms might exist and serve as the source of infection for those without direct animal contact.78, 91, 92, 292 Secondary transmission in household is not uncommon, which occur in over 20% of case clusters. Transmission is typically highly efficient in the hospital settings via infectious droplets/aerosols, leading to frequent occurrence of nosocomial outbreaks, as in the case of SARS.78, 93, 94, 95, 96, 293, 294\n",

A combination of upper respiratory (nasal, pharyngeal, nasopharyngeal), lower respiratory (higher yield due to higher viral levels, e.g. sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) whenever available), blood and fecal samples, and repeated sampling should be considered to maximize the chance of virus detection.103, 104, 105 A single negative test from an upper respiratory sample may be insufficient to rule out the diagnosis. For SARS-CoV, plasma RT-PCR can detect viremia as early as day 2\u20133 after symptom onset, and its level may have prognostic value.88, 99 Virus culture (e.g. using Vero cells) is confirmatory, but the delay to a result prevents its use for clinical management; also biosafety level-3 facilities are required. Serological diagnosis is retrospective and largely used for epidemiological surveillance purposes.103 Clinicians should refer to their local reference laboratories for coronavirus testing (e.g. pan-coronavirus RT-PCR, specific SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RT-PCR).87, 91\n",

An HIV protease-inhibitor (lopinavir-ritonavir) with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV was reported to cause viral load reduction and fewer ARDS and deaths in 41 patients; however, the study was uncontrolled.112 Another study reported that 19 patients who received \u2018convalescent-plasma\u2019 from recovering individuals, which contained neutralizing antibodies, had better clinical outcomes (survival 100% vs 66%, discharge rates 78% vs 23%).113 Subsequent in vitro and animal (ferrets, hamsters, macaques) studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting the S-protein may provide neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV, resulting in viral load reduction and resolution of lung lesions.114, 115\nIn vitro and animal (mice, macaques) studies show that type I interferons, if given prophylactically or shortly after exposure, may protect against SARS.116 In a small clinical study (n=9), interferon-alpha given within 5 days was associated with lower rates of intubation (11% vs 23%) and death (0% vs 8%).117 Against MERS-CoV, available data have shown that type I and type III interferons are active in vitro; a combination of IFN-\u03b1 2b and ribavirin given hours after infection appears to reduce lung injury in a macaque model.118 Clinical data are limited; among the few patients who received such treatment, no consistent result was observed.

The RSV genome encodes two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and nine structural proteins, including the F (fusion) and G (attachment) glycoproteins on the viral envelope. Antibodies against the F and G proteins are neutralizing, and have been shown to confer protection against RSV infection in animal models. Immunity after primary infection (which generally occurs by 2 years of age) is partial and short-lived; thus, reinfections can occur throughout life.120 Low serum neutralizing antibody levels in adults predicts infection risk and disease severity.121 Immunologic mechanisms (e.g. cytokine responses) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe RSV diseases; however, emerging evidence suggests that uncontrolled viral replication, as indicated by high respiratory tract viral load, drives disease manifestations and is associated with severe clinical outcomes.120, 122, 123, 124, 125 Such findings provide an important rationale for the approach to antiviral drug development against RSV.122\n",

In healthy young adults, RSV may cause self-limiting upper respiratory illnesses; in the profoundly immunosuppressed, progressive pneumonitis can occur (17\u201384%), resulting in high mortality (7\u201383%).120, 132 Older adults hospitalized for RSV infection may present with fever, cough, sputum production, wheezing and dyspnea. Although wheezing and dyspnea may be more common with RSV, and the magnitude of fever sometimes lower, such findings could not reliably differentiate it from influenza.120, 131 Radiographically, about 50\u201360% of cases show active pneumonic changes such as consolidation and ground-glass opacities, which are typically small, patchy and unilateral.97, 120, 131 The majority (>70%) of adults hospitalized with RSV develop severe lower respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute bronchitis and exacerbations of COPD/asthma resulting in respiratory failure and hypoxemia, and 10\u201315% develop cardiovascular complications such as congestive heart failure or acute coronary syndrome.127, 128, 129, 131 Bacterial superinfection occurs in at least 12\u201317%.120, 127, 131 Published data suggest that around 10\u201318% of patients required ventilatory support because of respiratory failure and the overall mortality was approximately 8\u201310%; the outcomes are generally comparable to that of seasonal influenza.128, 131\n",

New antiviral agents (e.g. fusion protein and polymerase inhibitors, siRNA) and newer generation antibody therapies are under active research.120, 136, 137, 298 Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used to treat wheezing and exacerbations of COPD/asthma in adults, including those triggered by viral infections. Randomized controlled trials of corticosteroid therapy in young children with RSV infections have revealed a lack of clinical benefit and inconsistent control of inflammatory cytokine responses.138, 139 A recent study of corticosteroids in adults reported that virus control seemed to be unaffected but humoral immunity against RSV was diminished.140 It is suggested that the decision to treat RSV patients with corticosteroids should be weighed against the potential risks (e.g. bacterial superinfections) and be limited to a short course if used.131, 140 Because of the high rates of secondary infections, it is prudent to test and treat bacterial pathogens according to local resistance profiles. In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli may need to be considered in patients with underlying chronic lung diseases.127, 131\n",

Among children, the most common symptoms are rhinorrhea, cough or fever, although conjunctivitis, vomiting, diarrhea and rash have been reported infrequently.262 Encephalitis is a rare manifestation of hMPV infection.263, 264 Although hMPV and RSV are generally indistinguishable, fever is more frequent in children with hMPV, while rhino\u00adrrhea is more commonly observed in RSV-infected individuals.248, 265 Children appear to be at higher risk of developing bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and possibly asthma exacerbation, particularly when younger than 2 years of age. Most hospitalizations are the result of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children. Coinfection with hMPV and RSV results in more severe disease and an increased risk for admission to the ICU and a 10-fold increase in the need for mechanical ventilation.266 The typical duration of symptoms is around a week with viral shedding typically for 1\u20132 weeks.254, 255 Repeat infection has clearly been documented although subsequent infections are typically limited to the upper airway. Severe, sometimes fatal infections, often involving the lower airway, have been described in adults and children with malignancy, hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. The severity of illness is likely related to reduced cellular immune responses. Likewise, elderly adults, adults with severe cardiopulmonary disease, and residents of long-term care facilities have a higher incidence of hMPV infection with an increased risk of lower airway involvement, complications including bacterial superinfections, and death.248 Although asymptomatic infection is common for otherwise healthy adults, such individuals may present with cold- and influenza-like illnesses.267 Adults commonly present with cough, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, but rarely have fever.130 The role of hMPV in exacerbations of COPD is unclear as one large study demonstrated an association whereas another failed to identify hMPV in patients with COPD exacerbations.268, 269\n",

Although most HBoV1 is detected in the upper airway, clinical symptoms and positive BAL specimens suggest that HBoV1 is capable of infecting the lower airways down to at least the bronchioles.275 HBoV1 DNA is detectable in the serum suggesting dissemination beyond the airway. Likewise, HBoV1 can rarely be detected in stool with and without gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting passive spread from the respiratory to the gastrointestinal tract.275\n",

Presence of HBoV1 DNA in serum may provide enhanced specificity of active infection as it correlates with HBoV1-specific IgM 61% of the time.284, 285 Quantitative virology may also help improve the probability that HBoV detection is associated with the clinical presentation, as high viral loads (>2 \u00d7 108 genomes/mL) in nasopharyngeal aspirates appear to correlate with illness severity and fewer coinfections.275, 286 Serology, particularly IgG avidity EIA, may also increase the probability that detected HBoV is truly associated with clinical disease.275 Given the limitations of diagnostic strategies, most would recommend using two diagnostic modalities to diagnose HBoV infection.",
