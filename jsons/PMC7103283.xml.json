Despite the importance of tolerance to the regulation of auto-reactive immune responses, it is quite clear that tolerance can be overcome, and that T cell epitopes contribute to the induction of immune response to autologous proteins. There are many parallels between the development of autoimmune disease and immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins, including the reduction of regulatory T cell (Treg) immune responses and induction of T effector responses [9]. Deviation of the immune response away from tolerance towards immunogenicity probably involves B cells, effector T cells, and danger signals such as toll-like receptor ligands.",

The presence of low levels of circulating antibodies against autologous proteins is a well-known phenomenon in drug development, but these auto-antibodies rarely interfere with the drug. In contrast, the presence of cell responses to autologous proteins are a critical determinant of autoimmune disease; they also contribute to the development of higher levels of anti-self antibodies by providing cytokine \u201chelp\u201d to B cells [10].",

In theory, T and B cell receptors to \u201cself\u201d are eliminated in the course of immune maturation in the thymus (T cells) and the bone marrow (B cells). However, there is evidence that auto-reactive T cells are present in the peripheral circulation. Thymic deletion of self-reactive T cells is imperfect. 25\u201340% of auto-reactive T cells escape into the periphery because of low avidity [11], [12], absence of thymic expression, inefficient expression or inefficient processing of T cell epitopes [13]. This has been documented in diabetes [14], rheumatoid arthritis [15] and multiple sclerosis [16]. Tolerance to self can be overcome if a danger signal [17] is present, or if cross-reactivity between self epitopes and epitopes of pathogens triggers an effector immune response against self (e.g. human coronavirus [18] and lyme disease antigen [19]). The importance of danger signals to the development of T effector responses to autologous proteins is worth bearing in mind, since many protein therapeutics are produced using methods that may incorporate such signals at levels that are below the usual limits of detection. Another factor that may play a role in the induction of autoimmunity is known as \u201cheterologous immunity\u201d or T cell response to epitopes that cross-react with self [20]. Unfortunately, the role of heterologous immunity in the development of ADA to protein therapeutics remains unexplored at present, even though it is likely to be a contributing factor.",

More commonly, T cell dependent (Td) activation of B cells is triggered, leading to a robust antibody response, affinity maturation, isotype switching, and the development of B cell memory. The induction of IgG class ADA, whether to chimeric antibodies, human antibodies, recombinant proteins, or proteins of non-human origin, normally implies that some of the sequences in the protein triggered a T cell response that led to a Td B cell response, and thus, isotype switching [21].",

They prime na\u00efve CTL and B cell responses, generate secondary responses and contribute to the induction and sustainability of immune memory [24]. T helper (CD4+) T cells are critically important instigators of ADA response. The T cell receptor (TCR) assures immune response specificity through interaction with epitope-loaded MHC on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

TCR activation switches on downstream signaling pathways in T cells that lead to secretion of IL-2. This cytokine, in turn, stimulates further intracellular signaling by binding in an autocrine fashion to the IL-2 receptor, which leads to T cell proliferation [25].

            "text": "Regulatory or \u201csuppressor\u201d T cells are key players in the complex set of interactions that regulate immune responses to ensure tolerance to self. There are two types of tolerance: central and peripheral. Central T cell tolerance occurs during thymic development, when T cells that have high affinity TCR for autologous epitopes are deleted. B cells that can recognize self-proteins may similarly be deleted in the bone marrow. In addition, peripheral tolerance mechanisms exist to control autoimmunity and prevent auto-reactivity after lymphocytes have exited the thymus or bone marrow. According to current thinking, auto-reactive T cells with moderate affinity may escape deletion and be converted to function as \u2018natural\u2019 regulatory T cells (nTreg) to suppress autoimmunity [30]. Tolerance in the periphery is characterized by plasticity of T cell lineage commitment, where mature T cells are converted to a Treg phenotype upon activation through their T cell receptor in the presence of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. The role of these \u2018adaptive\u2019 Treg (aTreg) cells may be to dampen effector immune responses either to control a vigorous pro-inflammatory immune reaction to infection or possibly to facilitate co-existence with beneficial symbiotic bacteria and viruses [31], [32]. Tregs exhibit a CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ phenotype; these proteins are important to maintaining tolerance as attenuated CD25 and FoxP3 expression is associated with autoimmune disease [33], [34].",

This is extremely important to help prevent autoimmune diseases. Tregs are promoted by the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) by leading to the induction of FoxP3 expression, which in turn renders the T cell suppressive function [35]. Tregs secrete specific cytokines that have a suppressing effect on effector response. IL-2 is a cytokine that is important for T cell proliferation. It contributes to signal transduction in Tregs and the maintenance of homeostasis and competitive fitness of natural Treg cells [35]. Stimulating CD4+ cells with antigen in vitro in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 has led to the induction of FoxP3 expression. However, following re-stimulation with antigen in the absence of exogenous TGF-\u03b2, most cells seem to lose the FoxP3 expression [35].",

As described above, antigenic (and autologous) proteins are broken down by proteolytic enzymes in the APC. During this process very large numbers of peptide fragments are produced. Any one of these fragments could be a T cell epitope, but only about 2% of all the fragments generated have the right amino acid side chains that allow them to bind in the MHC binding groove and be presented on the surface of the APC. One of the critical determinants of immunogenicity is the strength of T cell epitope binding to MHC molecules [39]. Peptides binding with higher affinity to MHC are more likely to be displayed on the cell surface where they can be recognized by TCRs. Both T effectors and Treg have TCR that bind to MHC\u2013peptide complexes; as far as can be determined, it is the nature of the T cell (Treg or T effector) that determines the overall effect of the T cell responses; the T cell epitope sequence and its affinity for MHC does not appear to differ between T cell types.",

EpiMatrix predicted a strong signal for immunogenicity within the 14-amino acid carboxy-terminal region of the peptide portion of FPX. With administration of FPX in 76 healthy human subjects, 37% developed antibodies after a single injection. A memory T cell response against the carboxy-terminus of the peptide was observed in antibody positive subjects but not in antibody negative subjects. The predicted promiscuity of the predicted T cell epitope(s) was confirmed by representation of all common HLA alleles in antibody positive subjects. HLA-haplotype DRB1\u204e0701/1501 was predicted to be associated with the highest T cell and antibody response; this was confirmed in T cell and antibody assays.

The importance of T cell help is nowhere more obvious than for influenza vaccines. Conventional influenza vaccines are designed to stimulate a protective antibody response to hemagglutinin (HA). Even though T cell help is required for high specific IgG antibody titers against the HA antigen [63], antibody titers are usually relatively weak and do not last very long. Induction of CD4+ T cell response to influenza Th cell epitopes improves antibody response against B cell epitopes and generates long-term memory [64], [65]. The live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is much more immunogenic, suggesting that better-conserved T cell epitopes present in the internal flu proteins that are present in the LAIV [66] contribute to the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Therefore, the presence of T cell epitopes is critically important for the induction of B cell response, and particularly B cell memory, against foreign antigens.",

Presumably, this is due to the ability of these epitopes to be effectively processed by APCs and presented on a range of different MHC molecules (since more than one binding motif is present), thereby triggering a range of CD4+ T cell clones, leading to a synergistic effect. We have numerous examples from our vaccine research. For example, the EpiMatrix epitope-mapping algorithm was used to identify highly promiscuous T cell epitopes within the predicted secreted proteins from the F. tularensis tularensis genome as well as from known expressed proteins. Peptide epitopes were tested in ELISpot assays using blood from human subjects that had recovered from F. tularensis tularensis infection. ELISpot assays showed positive IFN-gamma responses to 21 of 25 individual Class II peptides and to peptide pools, in most human subjects [67]. Although differences in the HLA restriction of the molecules contributes to subject variability, these MHC binding motif-rich epitopes are generally highly immunogenic, leading to a 93% overall positive response rate in our vaccine programs.",

Modification or removal of the specific amino acids that contribute to HLA binding led to a reduction in the potential of epitope to stimulate T cell response.

We discovered seven epitope clusters conserved in human antibodies, each containing at least one EpiBar. These sequences are derived from the Fc region and from the framework regions of variable domains. Because EpiMatrix successfully identifies regions which code for T cell activation, conservation of these epitopes suggests that they play an important immunological role. Typically, we screen proteins for immunogenicity but we realized that these putative binders may in fact be tolerizing. In other words, these EpiMatrix results can be interpreted to mean that antibody sequences are presented to T cells to stimulate Tregs rather than effector T cells. These regulatory T cell epitopes (Tregitopes), when co-incubated with a target antigen, induce bystander tolerance, which could explain the relatively lower immunogenicity of humanized antibodies. Indeed, we found that the immunogenicity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is correlated to their Tregitope content (R-square 0.7, p\n = .002), a finding of direct relevance to the biologics industry [6]. Fig. 6\nillustrates the hypothesized mechanism of Tregitope-mediated immunosuppression. A major implication of this concept is that other autologous proteins may also contain regulatory T cell epitopes. As therapeutics, these proteins will interface with the immune system and their regulatory and effector epitopes will be presented to T cells. Therefore, regulatory T cell epitopes must also be accounted for when addressing protein immunogenicity.",

Therefore, diminishing the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins without hindering their function may improve clinical outcomes [72]. Epitope mapping and evaluation of the potential for immunogenicity on an \u201cimmunogenicity scale\u201d is one approach; the same tools can be used to identify clusters of epitopes for removal. As described previously, reduction in T cell epitope content has been associated with reduced immunogenicity. This can be accomplished by substitution of key amino acids in the T cell epitope sequences which abrogate binding to HLA and thereby attenuate epitope potential to trigger a T cell response. Altered T cell epitopes no longer bind to HLA. Therefore, uncovering the immunogenic regions and specific amino acid residues involved in binding to HLA can allow protein therapeutics developers to abrogate T-dependent antibody responses, reducing the immunogenicity of their candidate drug. Such epitope-modifications are easily evaluated in vitro and in vivo prior to release of the protein therapeutic for clinical development. This method of reducing immunogenicity, also known as de-immunization, is described in detail in [72].",

However, not all T cell epitope clusters can be considered to be potentially immuno-stimulatory. As discussed above, some T cells specific for autologous proteins escape thymic deletion and become natural regulatory T cells (Tregs); they appear to serve as regulators or suppressors of auto-reactive immune responses [30]. Therefore, epitopes that induce Treg responses might be useful to down-regulate immune responses in the context of protein therapeutics and autoimmune disease. Tregs have been shown to suppress auto-antibodies and thus they may also play a role in the suppression of ADA [9], [76]. We have developed a Treg epitope (Tregitope) adjusted EpiMatrix score for monoclonal antibodies to predict anti-therapeutic antibody response by deducting the scores of Tregitopes from the EpiMatrix raw score. In our experience adjusted scores are better correlated to the observed clinical immune response. This scoring protocol enables categorization of antibodies into four groups: 1) low Tregitope and high T effector (neo epitope) content; 2) low Tregitope and low neo epitope content; 3) high Tregitope and low neo epitope or 4) high Tregitope content and high neo epitope content (Table 2\n).",

Following FDA approval of the first therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb), many were found to elicit anti-drug antibodies in immune-competent patients [78], [79], [80], [81]. For example, OKT3, an immunosuppressive drug used to treat transplant rejection and the first monoclonal antibody approved for human use, elicited antibodies in 86% of patients [82]. Not surprisingly, in hindsight, the explanation for immunogenicity was patient response to foreign (mouse) sequences. To improve the next generation of mAbs, constant domain sequences of antibody light and heavy chains were replaced by human constant regions to produce chimeric antibodies. This approach met with mixed success because chimeric antibodies still raised human anti-mouse antibodies against the mouse variable regions. While an improvement over fully murine monoclonals, chimeric antibodies were shown to raise varying immune responses depending on their target and their indication. For example, Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, elicited no immune response from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients [83], [84] but was immunogenic in 27% of Sjogren's syndrome and 65% of systemic lupus erythomatosus patients [85], [86]. Later, monoclonal antibodies were further humanized by grafting mouse CDR regions onto a human scaffold so that the only mouse sequences to remain were those that encode antigen specificity. Remarkably, some of these antibodies are still immunogenic. For example, Campath-1H (Alemtuzumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets human CD52 expressed in many lymphoid neoplasms, has been shown to be immunogenic in > 60% of rheumatoid arthritis patients [87], [88], [89]. Indeed, a completely human antibody sequence also does not guarantee immune stealth. 17% of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease patients receiving Humira (Adalimumab), a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitor, developed anti-drug antibodies [90], [91]. The immunogenicity of this antibody has been linked to the presence of five to seven key T helper epitopes as defined by a number of different laboratories (Fiona Harding, Philip Stas, Matt Baker, personal communication).",

Stimulation of T helper (Th) cells by antigens involves first activation by interleukin 1 (IL-1) (T1) and then presentation of the antigen at the surface of antigen-presenting cells (usually macrophages, dendritic cells or B cells) (T2) in association with class II major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC II); for extrinsic (foreign) proteins this requires initial capture of the protein, followed by denaturation and/or degradation so as to associate the molecule or fragments with MHC II. T cells stimulated in this way express receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2), and secrete various molecules, including factors which stimulate B cells to divide and/or secrete Ig, interferon-gamma and IL-2. (B1) In turn, IL-2 causes proliferation of Th and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells. Encounter of the same antigen by a B cell results in processing and presentation of the epitope at the B cell surface in the context of MHC (B1). Co-stimulatory factors such as B7 interact with the memory B cell (B2), resulting in the secretion of cytokines by the T cell (B3). These cytokines allow the B cell to mature and become a dedicated IgG-producing (isotype switched) memory B cell (B4).",

Peptides that have predicted Z-scores above 1.64 (approximately the top 5% of all 9-mers derived from any given protein) have a significant chance of binding to MHC molecules and scores above 2.32 (approximately the top 1%) are highly likely to bind to MHC molecules. A cluster score is calculated by summing the EpiMatrix scores for each of the eight class II alleles. Cluster scores higher than 10 are considered to be significant.
