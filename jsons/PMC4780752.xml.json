The \u03b3-, \u03b2-, and \u03b1-phases exist at ambient pressure (p\n = 101.325 kPa) and low temperature (\u03b3 at T\n < 54.4 K; \u03b2 at T\n < 43.8 K; \u03b1 at T\n < 23.8 K) [1], [2]. At ambient temperature (T\n = 295 K) under pressure of 5.4 GPa, oxygen solidifies into the \u03b2-phase, then at 9.6 GPa into the orthorhombic \u2018orange\u2019 \u03b4-phase, and, successively, at 10 GPa into the monoclinic \u2018dark red\u2019 \u03b5-phase. Above 96 GPa \u03b5-oxygen is transformed into the metallic \u03b6-phase which exhibits superconductivity (T\nc\n = 0.6 K) [1], [2]. The \u2018red\u2019 \u03b5-phase revealed the structure of two combined tetroxetane (cyclo-O4) rings, giving rise to rhombohedral O8 clusters [2]. In 1990, a ninth allotropic modification of oxygen was theoretically predicted [3], the cyclooctaoxygen (cyclo-O8, octoxocane) (Fig. 1A) [1], [3], assumed to exist in analogy to the common modification of elemental sulfur, cyclooctasulfur (cyclo-S8, octathiocane) [3]. We now wish to report the (biomimetic) synthesis, isolation, chemical characterization, biochemical and epigenetic significance of cyclo-O8 in the form of its sodium crown complex, (octoxocane-\u03ba4\nO\n1,O\n3,O\n5,O\n7)sodium(1 +) or cyclo-O8-Na+ (Fig. 1B), which can be liganded to give aqua(chloro)(octoxocane-\u03ba4\nO\n1,O\n3,O\n5,O\n7)sodium (Fig. 1C).",

Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates for the in vitro assays and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 before testing so that cells were 80\u2013100% confluent upon infection. Each dilution of test or control compound was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate, and three wells of each dilution were then infected with the test virus. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was \u2264 0.007 cell culture infective dose 50% (CCID50)/cell for each virus. Two wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. Six wells per plate were set aside as uninfected, untreated cell controls, and six wells per plate were infected with no treatment as virus controls. A known active compound was assayed in parallel as a control. The test medium was MEM with 2% FBS for chikungunya virus and MERS coronavirus, and MEM with 1 IU/ml trypsin and 10 \u03bcg/ml of EDTA for influenza A viruses. Assay plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. After 3 days, when CPE was observed microscopically, each well was filled with 0.011% (m/v) neutral red, a vital stain, and the plate was incubated for \u2248 2 h at 20\u201325 \u00b0C. The unincorporated neutral red solution was removed from the wells and the incorporated dye was then eluted by adding S\u00f8rensen citrate-buffered ethanol. The plates were then read on a spectrophotometer at \u03bb\n = 540 nm wavelength to quantify the neutral red taken up by the healthy cells. The optical density of test wells was converted to percent of cell control and normalized to the virus controls. The concentration of test compound required to inhibit CPE by 50% (EC50) was calculated by regression analysis. The concentration of compound that would cause 50% CPE in the absence of virus (CC50) was also calculated by regression analysis using the uninfected wells treated with test compounds compared with untreated cell controls. The selectivity index 50% (SI50) is the CC50 divided by EC50. Assays were conducted in triplicate, and the arithmetic mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated.",

A 100 \u03bcl aliquot of each dilution was then plated onto 4 replicate wells of 96-well plates seeded with the applicable cells for each virus strain. Plates were incubated as noted above until viral CPE reached its endpoint, then each well was scored microscopically for the presence of viral CPE. The virus titer was determined based on the endpoint using the Reed\u2013Muench method [31]. Test wells were compared with virus control wells, and the concentration of compound required to reduce virus yield by 90% or 1 log10 (EC90) was calculated by regression analysis. Assays were conducted in (at least) triplicate, and the arithmetic mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated.",

            "text": "In an endeavor to gain new antiviral substances, the reported reaction [32] of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) nucleoside cytidine with ninhydrin on reflux was re-examined. Instead of cytidine, cytidine hydrochloride (cytidine \u00d7 HCl) was utilized (Fig. 2A). The reported reaction [32] did not proceed, instead a crystalline material NC could be isolated which gave not the elemental analysis of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. This striking difference of NC from cytidine \u00d7 HCl was examined further by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1), Fourier transform infrared (FT\u2013IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2), FT\u2013Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S3), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2013MS) (Fig. S4A and Fig. S5). It could be substantiated that NC contained an inert material not being salt (NaCl), since the FT\u2013IR spectrum of NC differed from that of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. According to elemental analysis this inert material could account for one O2 and a quarter of NaCl pro one cytidine \u00d7 HCl. In consequence, the formula was multiplied fourfold and this resulted in an oxygen 8-ring, cyclo-O8 (Fig. 1A), coordinated to one Na+ (Fig. 1B). The interpretation of the ESI\u2013MS spectrum of NC actually proved the inclusion of cyclo-O8-Na+ in NC, revealing was the detection of the aqua(octoxocane-\u03ba4\nO\n1,O\n3,O\n5,O\n7)sodium(1 +) cation (Fig. S5). Since in the 1H-NMR spectrum of NC, in comparison to the 1H-NMR reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl, the differentially affected resonances were the 4-NH2, the 3-NH+, and the H-5 protons of the protonated cytidine (Fig. S1), it is assumed that the points of coordination between cyclo-O8-Na+ and cytidine \u00d7 HCl are the two 4-NH2 hydrogens and one non-Na+-coordinated (free) oxygen of cyclo-O8-Na+. Consequently, a formula for NC can be elaborated: cytidine hydrochloride \u2212 aqua(chloro)(octoxocane-\u03ba4\nO\n1,O\n3,O\n5,O\n7)sodium (4:1) (Fig. 2A). The FT\u2013Raman spectrum of NC (Fig. S3B) was nearly identical to the reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl (Fig. S3A). This, contrary to expectation, pointed to Raman-inactivity of cyclo-O8-Na+.",

Our interest concentrated on oxygen formation by possible catalase effects under physiological conditions. The catalase effect is the disproportionation of dihydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen and water: 2 H2O2 \u2192 O2\n + 2 H2O. As a catalyst RNA was selected, since RNA can exhibit enzymatic (ribozyme) activities in vivo\n[33]. The selected RNA was Candida utilis anamorph yeast low-molecular weight RNA. This RNA consists of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the C. utilis 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [34], [35]. As a result, it was discovered that NC catalyzed oxygen formation from H2O2 (catalase effect) [11] weakly in presence of NaHCO3, and strongly in presence of both C. utilis RNA and NaHCO3 (Fig. S9). Interestingly, NC could be fully substituted by cytidine \u00d7 HCl. Multiple controls assured that oxygen neither was produced spontaneously, nor from any other relevant combination of the utilized reagents. Taken together, the nucleoside cytidine, not cyclo-O8-Na+, was responsible for the catalase activity expressed in presence of H2O2 and C. utilis RNA under biomimetic conditions.",

For this purpose, thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays [37] were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclo-O8-Na+ contained in NC. Firstly, the affinity of the cyclo-O8-Na+ toward C. utilis low-molecular weight RNA was investigated (Fig. S12). It was found that the cyclo-O8-Na+ contained in NC retained the chromatographic shift of C. utilis 5S rRNA, but not the chromatographic shift of C. utilis tRNAs. Interestingly, since work conditions were not human skin ribonuclease (RNase)-free, the RNase A digestion products of C. utilis 5S rRNA were separated chromatographically (Fig. S12). These dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates (products of RNase A digestion) [38] result from human skin RNase 7 [39]-mediated digestion of C. utilis 5S rRNA. The structures of these dinucleotides can be deduced [34], [35], since RNase 7 belongs to the RNase A superfamily [39]. The cyclo-O8-Na+ contained in NC bound strongly to these dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates, since their chromatographic shifts were significantly retarded. Controls were included to differentiate the sole binding of cytidine \u00d7 HCl to the RNA targets by Watson\u2013Crick base pairing [40] from the indicative cyclo-O8-Na+\nplus cytidine \u00d7 HCl binding to the RNA targets.",

NC and dNC were non-toxic to PBM cells, but stimulated the growth of CCRF\u2013CEM cells. This pointed to a catalase effect exerted by NC and dNC, since CCRF\u2013CEM cells are extremely sensitive to H2O2\n[43], and scavenging of H2O2 by \u2018catalase factors\u2019 is CCRF\u2013CEM cell growth rate-limiting [43], [44]. Since NC was more active as a growth stimulant for CCRF\u2013CEM cells than dNC, the responsible \u2018catalase factors\u2019 should be the nucleoside hydrochlorides, not the equimolar cyclo-O8-Na+-content in NC and dNC. NC and dNC exhibited no significant in vitro antiviral activities against the retro-transcribing human immunodeficiency type 1 and hepatitis B viruses (HIV-1 and HBV) (Table S1). NC showed no significant in vitro inhibiting activity versus the replication of influenza A, chikungunya, and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses (Table S2). In summary, cyclo-O8-Na+ is, contrary to expectation, essentially non-toxic to human cells, and cytidine in conjunction with RNA acts as a catalyst in producing cyclo-O8-Na+ from ubiquitous [45] H2O2 through a catalase reaction in cultured human cells.",

We suggest a model for a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4\n), based on the observed complexation of cyclo-O8-Na+ and spermine phosphate to ssDNA. One reason why this protecting shield of in vivo DNA was overlooked until now may be its destruction during DNA purification by the classical phenol extraction method of Schuster, Schramm, and Zillig\n[47]. In our model (Fig. 4A), the phosphate backbone of ssDNA binds one cyclo-O8-Na+\npro three nucleotides, and this binary complex binds one spermine monophosphate to form a ternary epigenetic core of DNA. The monohydrogen phosphate bridges the cyclo-O8-Na+ with the sperminium cation, and the cyclo-O8-Na+ has an inverted alternating orientation (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the sperminium tetracation cannot bind alone to DNA in this model, since the distances [d (N\n1,N\n4) = 490 pm; d (N\n1,N\n12) = 1600 pm] between the four ammonium nitrogens do not fit the average repeating distance (d\n\u00d8\n = 650 \u00b1 30 pm) of the phosphate anion charges of DNA. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that in our model for the first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A) a repeating unit is formed from cyclo-O8-Na+ and spermine phosphate that perfectly fits both the triplet nature of the genetic code [48] and the repeating distance of the phosphate anion backbone of DNA.",

The theoretical intracellular concentration of the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O8-Na+ complex required to cover all triplets of the dsDNA genome in a blood lymphocyte of Bos taurus was calculated as 13.8130 mM (see Section 2.9). The actual concentration of spermine was measured as 1.57 \u00b1 0.12 (mM \u00b1 s.d.) [15]. Therefore, the coverage of B. taurus genome can be calculated as 2.62 \u00b1 0.50 (% \u00b1 s.d.) (see Section 2.9). A correlation was obtained when this value was compared to the proportion of protein-coding exons in B. taurus genome which was calculated as 2.64% or 2.68% by two independent methods (see Section 2.9). This points to complete coverage of actively transcribed gene regions in B. taurus interphase genome by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O8-Na+ complex. Since spermine binds more strongly to GC-rich dsDNA (pBR322 plasmid) [15], it can be assumed that the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O8-Na+ complex binds preferentially to epigenetic, non-methylated CpG island hotspots [49] and is involved in epigenetic gene regulation [49].",

This is a reasonable result, since spermine synthesis is highest in the metaphase of mitosis in the cell cycle, coincident with an extraordinary high condensation grade of metaphase chromatin [50]. Control for this in vitro result is the published elemental phosphorus content (mmol/kg dry weight) in mitotic chromatin of primary cryptal enterocytes of murine duodenum [21]. The obtained in vivo value corresponds to a haploid genomic coverage of 12.4%, and a nuclear RNA coverage of 77.3%, by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O8-Na+ complex in mitotic chromatin (see Section 2.11).

Selenium has the ability to protect DNA from noxious influences (oxidative stress, radiation, cytotoxic agents) [51] and is essential to genomic stability [52], but the exact molecular biological basis for these phenomena is unknown. If in our model of a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A) the monohydrogen phosphate is replaced by hydrogen selenite (Fig. 4B), an epigenetic explanation for the interaction of selenium with eukaryotic in vivo DNA could be given. This model may account for, at least some of, the well-known bimodal, protective and toxic, in vivo effects exerted by selenium onto mammalian physiology [51], [52], [53].

One can speculate that at the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O8-Na+ complex resulted as a consequence from the combined accumulation of atmospheric oxygen and prokaryotic RNA, since the evolution of spermine synthases from prokaryotic spermidine synthase was proposed [56] as co-occurring with the onset of proto-eukaryotic life.",
