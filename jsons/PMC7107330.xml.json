To test our hypothesis, we inoculated PBMCs with MERS-CoV and evaluated the proportion of MERS-CoV\u2013infected T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes with flow cytometry. Notably, a substantial proportion of T cells were infected by MERS-CoV. In contrast, MERS-CoV only modestly infected monocytes and NK cells, whereas it marginally infected B cells (Figure 1A). Quantitatively, the average percentages (\u00b1standard deviation [SD]) of MERS-CoV NP\u2013positive T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes were 65.6% \u00b15.4%, 5.4% \u00b1 2.4%, 18.5% \u00b1 4.8%, and 13.5% \u00b1 6.6%, respectively (Figure 1A). As expected, the percentage of MERS-CoV infection was in direct accordance with the level of surface DPP4 expression on these PBMC subsets (Figure 1B). Overall, we showed that MERS-CoV was capable of infecting T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and, to a less extent, B cells. The efficiency of infection highly correlated with the level of surface DPP4 expression.\n",

Strikingly, whereas a substantial number of T cells were infected by MERS-CoV, they were largely refractory to SARS-CoV infection (Figure 2A). This differential susceptibility might be in part attributed to the discrepancy in the expression levels of DPP4 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in T cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we asked whether the 2 major populations of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, were equally susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. As shown in Figure 2B, substantial numbers of both populations were infected by MERS-CoV. However, a significantly higher proportion of CD4+ T cells (mean \u00b1 SD, 72.1% \u00b1 9.1%) were infected, compared with CD8+ cells (50.9% \u00b1 7.7%). The degree of infection again correlated with surface DPP4 expression (Figure 2C). Next, because DPP4 plays essential roles in a broad array of T-cell functions [24\u201326], we evaluated the expression level of surface and total DPP4 on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells after MERS-CoV infection. Remarkably, MERS-CoV significantly downregulated surface DPP4 in infected CD4+ T cells by 80% and CD8+ T cells by 70% (Figure 2D). Changes in the total DPP4 level were less dramatic, with values of 50% and 30% for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively (Figure 2D). In contrast to DPP4, surface or total levels of CD4 and CD8 were unaltered in infected T cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Together, our data demonstrated that MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV efficiently infected T cells and significantly downregulated surface DPP4 in the infected cells.\n",

The number of MERS-CoV genome copies in the cell lysates (Supplementary Figure 3A) and supernatants (Supplementary Figure 3B) of infected T cells remained largely steady over time. As expected, SARS-CoV similarly failed to replicate in T cells. Intriguingly, the number of intracellular MERS-CoV genome copies was 2\u20133 logs higher than that of SARS-CoV (Supplementary Figure 3A).

To examine whether MERS-CoV infection induced cell death in T cells, we assessed TUNEL activity in MERS-CoV\u2013infected T cells and compared the findings to those in SARS-CoV\u2013 or mock-infected T cells. TUNEL assays detect DNA fragmentation that results from apoptotic signaling cascades and identifies cells in the last phase of apoptosis [37]. We detected an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in MERS-CoV\u2013infected T cells at as early as 6 hours after infection, compared with SARS-CoV\u2013 or mock-infected T cells. At 24 and 48 hours after infection, significantly more TUNEL-positive cells were detected in MERS-CoV\u2013infected T cells comparing with findings for the 2 other groups (Figure 3A). Quantitatively, the mean percentages (\u00b1SD) of TUNEL-positive T cells upon MERS-CoV infection were 8.2% \u00b1 2.7%, 20.0% \u00b17.8%, and 27.8% \u00b1 9.7% at 6, 24, and 48 hours after infection, respectively (Figure 3B).

The 2 pathways end and converge at the execution phase, which involves the activation of execution caspases, including caspases 3, 6, and 7 [39]. Among them, caspase 3 is considered to be the most important executer caspase and is activated by any of the initiator caspases (caspases 2 and 8\u201310) [38]. Therefore, we evaluated the extent of caspase 3 activation in infected T cells. Remarkably, substantial active caspase 3 expression was evident in MERS-CoV\u2013infected T cells as early as 6 hours after infection, and expression remained high over time (Figure 3C). Specifically, active caspase 3 was detected at a mean frequency (\u00b1SD) of 74.9% \u00b16.8%, 75.3% \u00b1 10.2%, and 63.2% \u00b1 7.6% among MERS-CoV-NP\u2013positive T cells at 6, 24, and 48 hours after infection, respectively (Figure 3D). Caspase 3 activation was absent in mock-infected cells or in T cells that remained uninfected in the MERS-CoV\u2013treated samples (Figure 3C).

Our data suggested that caspase 3 was also activated in Vero E6 cells, although the dynamic of activation was drastically different from that in T cells. Remarkably, at 6 hours after infection, only a subtle population of Vero E6 cells was infected by MERS-CoV, with no caspase 3 activation (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, at 24 hours after infection, essentially all Vero E6 cells were infected, and the vast majority of the infected cells were expressing activated caspase 3 (Figure 5A). On the other hand, a substantial number of T cells were infected at 6 hours after infection, with accompanying excessive caspase 3 activation. The level of infection and caspase 3 activation in T cells remained largely constant between 6 and 24 hours after infection (Figure 5A). Since Vero E6 cells are known to support robust MERS-CoV replication, we speculated that caspase 3 activation in Vero E6 cells was a result of virus replication. To test this hypothesis, we inoculated Vero E6 cells and T cells with UV-inactivated MERS-CoV. The replication capacity of MERS-CoV was completely abolished with 10 minutes of UV inactivation (Supplementary Figure 4). Strikingly, UV inactivation completely obliterated MERS-CoV infection and caspase 3 activation in Vero E6 cells (Figure 5B). In stark contrast, MERS-CoV entry and MERS-CoV\u2013induced caspase 3 activation in T cells remained largely unaltered by UV inactivation (Figure 5B). NP staining with no cell permeabilization (Supplementary Figure 5A) or on ice before cell permeabilization (Supplementary Figure 5B) both picked up little to no signal, suggesting the detected MERS-CoV NP signal was indeed intracellular but not from surface-attached viruses. Together, these data illustrated intrinsic differences in the dynamics of MERS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV\u2013induced caspase 3 activation in Vero E6 cells and T cells.\n",

Remarkably, CD3+ T cells from the spleen and tonsil were infected to a similar extent as T cells in the peripheral blood (Figure 6A). We further assessed the level of MERS-CoV\u2013induced apoptosis in these cells. Our data suggested that the percentage of TUNEL-positive (Figure 6B) and active caspase 3\u2013positive (Figure 6C) cells among MERS-CoV\u2013infected CD3+ T cells from the spleen and tonsil highly resembled that among the peripheral blood T cells.

We next used the common marmoset animal model [30, 31] to evaluate the involvement of T cells in MERS-CoV infection in vivo. Two male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; CM1 and CM2) were inoculated with 5 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV intratracheally. Upon necropsy of these infected animals, tissue samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of viral RNA. Notably, viral RNA was detected from the spleen tissues of both animals, with a viral gene to GAPDH ratio of 7.3 \u00d7 104 and 7.6 \u00d7 105 in CM1 and CM2, respectively (Supplementary Figure 6). Next, immunostaining was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of spleen from the infected animals. Remarkably, MERS-CoV NP was readily detected in the spleen (Figure 7D and 7G). More importantly, MERS-CoV NP was detected in T cells, which was suggested by the colocalization between MERS-CoV NP and CD3 (Figure 7D\u2013I). As a control, no MERS-CoV NP signal was detected when preimmune serum was used in place of MERS-CoV NP antibody (Figure 7A\u2013C). Overall, we demonstrated the capacity of MERS-CoV to disseminate to the spleens of common marmosets and infect CD3+ T cells therein, despite respiratory transmission of the pathogen.\n",

            "text": "Viremia has been frequently reported in patients with SARS and those with MERS. Viral RNA was detected in the sera of SARS patients during the acute phase of infection [44, 45]. MERS-CoV RNA could be detected in the blood of infected patients for a prolonged period [46\u201348]. The viremia can be attributed to circulating free viral RNA that should be transient, free virion in blood or virus in infected cells. Remarkably, our current study demonstrated that MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV efficiently infected T cells and induced substantial apoptosis in the infected cells. This discovery indicates that the viremia in patients with SARS and those with MERS may have different clinical significance. In particular, given the capacity of MERS-CoV to invade T cells, patients with MERS who develop viremia may have a more severe outcome. Of note, viremia is not the only route for MERS-CoV to infect T cells. T cells could be attracted to the infected lung under the action of chemoattractants and therefore be infected at the primary organ of MERS-CoV infection. Alternatively, dendritic cells, which we have previously shown to support robust MERS-CoV replication [22], can be infected, migrate to the draining lymph nodes, and transmit the virus to naive T cells during antigen presentation. Importantly, lymphopenia is a common hematological abnormality that has been frequently reported in SARS and MERS cases [7, 49]. It has been speculated that lymphopenia detected in SARS cases might be due to direct infection, tissue sequestration of lymphocytes, cytokine-mediated cell death, as well as suppression of bone marrow or thymus for T-cell generation. In this study, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV could directly infect T cells and induce apoptosis in the infected cells. Therefore, the underlying mechanism for SARS-CoV\u2013 and MERS-CoV\u2013induced lymphopenia could be distinct. In particular, lymphopenia in MERS but not SARS cases could be a result of direct infection of T cells and infection-induced apoptosis. In addition to apoptosis, the dramatic depletion of surface DPP4 in T cells upon MERS-CoV infection may substantially disrupt the proliferation and cellular function of T cells. The mechanism and implication of MERS-CoV\u2013directed DPP4 depletion in T cells deserve further investigation.",

            "text": "Multiple genes of SARS-CoV have been implicated in caspase induction [4]. We showed in the current study that MERS-CoV\u2013induced apoptosis in T cells was accompanied by the activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9. The maturation of caspases 8 and 9 suggested that the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways were triggered by MERS-CoV infection. Currently, the exact mechanism of MERS-CoV\u2013induced caspase upregulation is unknown. However, since UV-inactivated MERS-CoV induced caspase 3 upregulation to an extent similar to that of untreated MERS-CoV, we postulate that the detected caspase upregulation is likely attributed to the structural components of MERS-CoV, including the E, M, S, and N proteins. Nevertheless, our data demonstrated that, while approximately 70% of MERS-CoV\u2013infected T cells were expressing active caspase 3, a considerably lower percentage of infected T cells showed signs of caspase 8 or caspase 9 activation. Although the relationship of the quantity of initiator caspases (caspases 8 and 9) and execution caspase (caspase 3) is not linear, because they are catalyzed in a cascade, it is possible that other, yet-to-be-identified pathways are also involved in caspase 3 activation and in contributing to MERS-CoV\u2013induced apoptosis in infected T cells. Remarkably, the dynamics of MERS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV\u2013induced apoptosis in T cells were drastically different from findings in cell lines. We demonstrated that, whereas caspase 3 induction in cell lines was gradual and replication dependent, it was abrupt and replication-independent in T cells. This discrepancy is likely due to the difference in the efficiency of MERS-CoV entry of cell lines versus primary T cells, which may in turn be a result of differential surface DPP4 expression. In this regard, if virus-induced T-cell apoptosis is a pathogenic determinant of MERS, a novel treatment regimen such as one involving anti-apoptotic agents in addition to antivirals inhibiting virus replication may be considered to improve the outcomes of patients with MERS, as in the case of VX-765 for human immunodeficiency virus infection [50].",

To this end, we inoculated disassociated human spleen and tonsil cells with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, CD3+ T cells in the spleen and tonsil were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV\u2013induced apoptosis. Intriguingly, T cells from these organs appeared to demonstrate a higher degree of infection and apoptosis upon MERS-CoV challenge. This suggested that T cells at different developmental stages might be differentially affected by MERS-CoV. Finally, we examined the spleen of MERS-CoV\u2013infected common marmosets. Importantly, our data demonstrated that MERS-CoV could disseminate to the spleens of infected animals and infect their CD3+ T cells. Collectively, our ex vivo and in vivo findings suggest that MERS-CoV can invade not only T cells in the peripheral blood, but also the large repertoire of T cells in lymphoid organs, which may result in a more severe immunopathology.",

Cells were fixed at 24 hours after infection and assessed for MERS-CoV nucleoprotein (NP; A), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling activity (B), and active caspase 3 (C) among CD3+ cells.
