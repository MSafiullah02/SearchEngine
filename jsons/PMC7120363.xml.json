            "text": "Research has suggested that autophagy plays a key role during the clearance of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The host cells identify and clear the pathogens through autophagic degradation. This is similar to other types of selective autophagy, such as aggregate autophagy (aggrephagy) or mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Autophagy receptors selectively recognize ubiquitinated pathogens in xenophagy. After an autophagy receptor interacts with LC3 or GABARAP, the pathogen is transported to autophagosomes. Therefore, the clearance of invading pathogens by xenophagy is ubiquitination dependent. The modification with ubiquitin provides \u201ceat-me\u201d signals during xenophagy. Salmonella can be modified inside the host cells by linear and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. K48-linked and K63-linked ubiquitination can modify Mycobacterium marinum in macrophages. In epithelial cells, the residual membranes of Shigella can be identified and modified with K48-linked ubiquitination. During bacterial and viral infection, the signals mediated by the host cell receptors further trigger xenophagy. These receptors include Sequestosome 1-like receptors, pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs (Toll-like receptors) and NOD-like receptors, RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors), pathogen receptor CD46, and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products, or AGEs). These receptors trigger xenophagy by recognizing a large number of MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) and DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns). The autophagy receptors SLRs play a key role in controlling pathogen infection. SLRs contain one or more LIR domains that are capable of linking autophagic adaptor proteins. SLRs mainly include p62 (sequestosome-1, SQSTM1), OPTN (Optineurin), NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene) and NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa). SLRs can recognize ubiquitin-, galectin-, and membrane phospholipid-modified proteins. These modified proteins bind to the surface of invading microorganisms and damaged host cell surfaces. Moreover, SLRs assist in the connection between the modified proteins and ATG8 homologous proteins such as LC3 and GABARAP (GABAA receptor-associated protein) and then promote the autophagy receptor loaded with foreign microorganisms to enter newly formed autophagosomes. SLRs have different affinities for diverse types of ubiquitin chain-modified proteins, non-ubiquitin-modified proteins, or other ATG8 homologous proteins. These different affinities might be the reasons for the different abilities of pathogenic microorganisms to be recognized. For example, both NDP52 and p62 inhibit the proliferation of Salmonella, but only p62 can eliminate Sindbis virus.",

It is also possible that these pathogens are directly phagocytosed into autophagosomes. These bacteria have evolved the ability to interfere with autophagic degradation, which becomes a crucial part of their pathogenesis. For example, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes is inhibited in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an intracellular pathogen. Macrophages cannot effectively induce mature autophagosomes to degrade and eliminate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Autophagy inhibition provides a pivotal mechanism to explain the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection. Gutierrez et al. have shown that activated autophagy can inhibit the intracellular survival efficiency of M. tuberculosis. Starvation- or rapamycin-induced autophagy promotes the fusion of phagosomes containing M. tuberculosis with lysosomes and delivers more M. tuberculosis into lysosomes for degradation. In an M. tuberculosis-infected mouse model, it was found that myeloid cells from ATG5-deficient mice can accumulate more M. tuberculosis and cause more severe necrosis in lung tissue.",

Silencing the previously mentioned autophagy receptors leads to the proliferation of Salmonella, indicating the essential roles of these autophagy receptors in the inhibition of Salmonella infection. It was recently found that NDP52 binds LC3 and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) to promote the phosphorylation of serine residues at OPTN 177, thereby enhancing the binding ability of LC3B.\n",

DAG can directly localize to SCVs, which provides the possibility for the induction of autophagy pathways to clear Salmonella. DAG can cause damage to the SCV membrane, recruit protein kinase PKC\u03b4, and then trigger autophagy via the JNK and NADPH oxidase pathways. It was found that bacterial autophagosomes independently colocalized with DAG or ubiquitin, suggesting two independent autophagy degradation pathways. Consistent with the ideas of Noda and colleagues, DAG can trigger autophagy on the membrane of an SCV surrounding Salmonella. Noda et al. suggested that the recruitment of LC3 does not depend on the formation of barrier membranes, but instead requires at least three levels of ATG recruitment that involve the ULK1 complex, ATG9L1, and the ATG16L complex. Therefore, ATG recruitment is most likely at the site of pathogen invasion in the host cells with the contribution of non-LC3/GABARAP autophagy receptor proteins. It was found that the Tecpr1 (tachylectin-II-like beta-propeller domain) receptor interacts with ATG5 and clears Shigella by xenophagy. ATG16L1 was then recruited to ubiquitin-modified Salmonella by interacting with ubiquitin chains to complete autophagy clearance.",

            "text": "Studying the clearance of Salmonella helps to understand the mechanism of xenophagy. However, there are still many unresolved questions. Ubiquitin can colocalize to invading bacteria. It is still not clear whether the ubiquitin-modified components are from bacteria or host cells. During infection with Salmonella or AIEC (adherent-invasive E. coli), LRR (leucine-rich repeat, E3 ligase-rich leucine-rich repeat) and LRSAM1 (sterile alpha motif-containing-1) are required for ubiquitination modification. The LRR of the LRSAM1 domain recognizes the bacterial protein, and the RING domain is involved in ubiquitination. However, the bacterial ligands recognized by LRSAM1 and their ubiquitinated substrates are still unknown. The E3 ligase Parkin was found to be involved in the clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the host cell through the ubiquitination autophagy pathway. Parkin-deficient mice are more susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and Parkin-deficient flies are more susceptible to Salmonella and mycobacterial infections. However, it is still not clear what the binding target for Parkin is. Different autophagy receptors may recognize different \u201ceat-me\u201d signals. NDP52 is the only autophagy receptor that recognizes Galectin-8 binding-exposed polysaccharides. Different autophagy receptors have different affinities for polyubiquitin chains. Salmonella in the cytoplasm can be modified by at least two types of ubiquitin chains, the linear chain and the K63-linked ubiquitin chain. Compared to the K48-linked ubiquitin chain, p62 and OPTN preferentially bind to K63-linked and linear ubiquitin chains. The posttranslational modifications close to the ubiquitin-binding region can affect the binding properties of autophagy receptors. The advantage of using multiple autophagy receptors in xenophagy is the recruitment of different effector proteins. For example, NDP52 recruits TBK1 to bind Salmonella in the host cell. TBK1 increases LC3 binding by phosphorylating OPTN and p62 and promotes autophagy by regulating autophagosome maturation.",

Neutrophils are stimulated by exogenous microorganisms or chemicals to release extracellular fibrous structures composed of chromatin and granule proteins. These fibrous structures capture and kill a variety of extracellular microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Evidence has shown that similar events are also present in eosinophils and mast cells. NETosis is a cell death program in which chromatin release leads to host cell death. NETosis differs from apoptosis and necrosis. It requires three processes: oxidative stress, citrullinated histones, and autophagy. The importance of autophagy for NET formation has been supported by evidence that pharmacological autophagy interventions can regulate NET formation and affect the delivery of NET functional proteins. It was found that PMA relies on autophagy to induce NETosis. The autophagy inhibitor Wortmannin can inhibit NET formation in neutrophils.",

Additionally, autophagosomes contain defensin-like antimicrobial peptides that antagonize the action of microorganisms. These antibacterial peptides are mostly derived from products of cytoplasmic protein degradation such as ubiquitin and ribosomal precursor proteins, which can fuse with and kill bacteria in phagosomes. In M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages, it was found that the autophagy receptor p62 transports cytoplasmic proteins into autophagosomes, where these proteins are processed to kill M. tuberculosis.

Salmonella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibit phagosome maturation to survive and multiply in phagosomes. Shigella flexneri, Legionella pneumophila, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can destroy autophagosomes or use the phagosome as a proliferation site. Studies have shown that Shigella flexneri quickly escapes to the cytoplasm and replicates after invading nonphagocytic cells. At the initial stage of infection, the autophagy core protein ATG16L1 is rapidly recruited by NOD1 and NOD2 to the invasion site of Shigella flexneri, activating autophagy by the RICK but not the NF-\u03baB pathway. After Shigella flexneri enters the cytoplasm, it utilizes the virulence protein IcsA to promote actin polymerization, thereby avoiding autophagy. The binding of the autophagy protein ATG5 to the IcsA protein isolates Shigella flexneri and promotes autophagy-mediated degradation. However, the T3SS (type III secretion system) of Shigella flexneri secretes another Shigella protein, IcsB. IcsB competes to inhibit protein binding of ATG5 to IcsA. After IcsB binds to the IcsA protein, the IcsA protein of Shigella flexneri is protected from ATG5 binding, which in turn causes Shigella flexneri to escape autophagic degradation. In addition to ATG5, other host factors also limit the effects of Shigella flexneri. For example, septin can capture Shigella flexneri and promote autophagic degradation. It was found that Shigella flexneri in the Septin cage colocalized with p62, NDP52, and LC3. Moreover, most Shigella flexneri and their vacuolar membrane residues that have escaped from autophagy can be recognized by Galectin-8, modified by ubiquitin and bound to autophagy receptor p62, and then isolated into autophagosomes. This isolation and degradation of Shigella flexneri residues help control the extent of downstream inflammatory reactions that would otherwise cause excessive damage to the host.",

After the cytoplasmic Listeria is modified by ubiquitin, the bacteria can be recognized by p62, which binds to LC3, and then Listeria undergoes autophagosome phagocytosis. Listeria monocytogenes, phospholipase C and ActA (actin assembly-inducing protein) are three Listeria-derived proteins that inhibit autophagy in host cells and prolong the survival of Listeria monocytogenes. Once in the cytoplasm, ActA on the surface of Listeria cells interacts with actin monomer and ARP2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) complex in the host cell to induce actin polymerization and drive motility. The above effects not only prevent Listeria from evading autophagic degradation but also inhibit the modification of the pathogen by ubiquitin. It was found that Listeria virulence factor K (Internalin K, InlK) can recruit host MVP (major vault protein). MVP is a major component of the cytoplasm that makes up the nucleus of ribonucleoprotein particles. The interaction between InlK and MVP helps Listeria to camouflage and evade host autophagy recognition. Listeria replication occurs primarily in the cytoplasm of host cells.

It is a common infectious disease with a high mortality rate in the tropics, especially in southeast Asia and northern Australia. B. pyogenes can adhere to nonphagocytic cells through bacterial surface type 4 pili. A small number of intracellular bacteria are recognized by the host cell through autophagy and are directly recruited into endosomes via LC3 rather than classical autophagosomes. However, most bacteria can evade autophagy and other defense mechanisms of the host cell, such as iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), and replicate in the cytoplasm. These bacteria invade adjacent cells by fusion with cell membranes, resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells. Invasion of host cells by Burkholderia pseudomallei involves one or several proteins encoded by the TTSS3 (type III secretion system cluster 3) gene, which is partially involved in the escape of the bacterium from the endosome to the cytoplasm. For example, the Pseudomonas serotype III secreted protein BopA plays a crucial role in the escape process. In studies of mouse macrophage infection by Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacterial bopA gene mutation enhances the colocalization of LC3, and the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1 reduced the number of intracellular viable bacteria. A large number of bacteria are killed in phagolysosomes. It was found that the Burkholderia VI-type cluster-related gene bpss0180 can induce autophagy in phagocytic and nonphagocytic host cells. In macrophage infection, the colocalization of bpss0180-mutated Burkholderia pseudomallei strains and LC3 is decreased, and the number of viable bacteria in the cell is reduced. Introducing the wide-type bpss0180 gene can reverse the above phenomenon. These results indicated that the bpss0180 gene product supports the intracellular survival of Burkholderia pseudomallei in host cells.",

Nef binds to the conserved domain of Beclin-1, which is the same binding region for the endogenous autophagy inhibitor GAPR1 (Golgi-associated plant pathogenesis-related protein 1).

Schmid et al. found that autophagosomes and MIICs have a high frequency of fusion in primary monocyte-derived DCs. More than 50% of MIICs receive proteins derived from autophagosomes. Inhibition of autophagosome formation by siRNAs significantly attenuates the antigen presentation ability of MHC class II molecules in eliciting acquired immune responses. This evidence indicates that autophagy is involved in the MHC class II molecular antigen presentation process. Studies in human B lymphoblastoid cells have revealed that some of the epitopes presented by MHC class II molecules are derived from host cells. Starvation-induced autophagy activation enhances the presentation of intracellularly derived antigens by MHC class II molecules. In macrophages or DCs that had phagocytosed BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin), autophagy induction by starvation or rapamycin increased the potency of MHC class II molecules to present M. tuberculosis antigens. The secretory antigen Ag85B of Mycobacterium tuberculosis colocalizes with LC3-positive autophagosomes, suggesting that autophagy can capture the antigens that have escaped the phagosome and deliver them to lysosomes for expression by MHC class II molecules. In studies of experimental mice injected with DCs infected with M. tuberculosis, rapamycin-pretreated DCs promoted their ability to initiate M. tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte responses. Blanchet et al. found LC3-positive autophagosome structures in DCs. These results suggest that autophagy participates in the activation of TLR receptor signaling and the antigen presentation process, thereby eliminating HIV-1. The HIV-1 Env protein activates mTOR to inhibit autophagy in DCs, thereby abolishing immune signals and enhancing the infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes. It was found that the interaction of influenza matrix proteins and LC3 elicits antigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte responses. Lee et al. found that autophagy is necessary for DCs to phagocytose extracellular antigens for presentation to CD4+ T lymphocytes in ATG5-silenced cells. During HSV-2 infection, the ability of ATG5-silenced DCs to activate CD4+ T lymphocytes and induce IFN-\u03b3 release was significantly reduced. In an HSV-2 virus lethal challenge study, ATG5-deficient mice were more likely to die.

Autophagy is involved in the transport of ATP from a specific lysosomal chamber to a secretory chamber in a process that has not been defined to date.

Autophagy causes tumor cells to release more ATP chemotactic signals during cell death, thereby recruiting antigen-presenting cells into the tumor and promoting antigen uptake by these cells. Autophagy-deficient malignant cells cannot induce an effective antitumor immune response in response to chemotherapy because they cannot release enough ATP to recruit myeloid cells and lymphocytes into the tumor. Exogenous administration of ATPase inhibitors can reverse this defect and drive myeloid cells and lymphocytes into the tumor by maintaining extracellular ATP concentration, thereby producing an effective antitumor immune response to dead tumor cells. The above ATP-driven chemotactic response to immune cells involves the metabotropic P2Y2 receptor.

Autophagosomes obtained by purification and separation not only carry long-lived proteins but also load a variety of short-lived polypeptides, including DRiPs, CRT, and DAMPs.

Autophagy plays a role in the selection of thymus T lymphocytes. This effect is more pronounced in response to rare antigens and some antigens entering the autophagic cavity. However, it is not clear that the above mechanism is true for the antigens presented by peripheral DCs.",

Abnormal activation of the innate immune response can cause inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases and septic shock. The host has an elegant innate immune regulatory system to prevent excessive or weak immune responses. Regarding the removal of pathogens, autophagy plays an essential role in innate immunity and adaptive immunity (Table 27.1). For example, nonphagocytic cells rely on the formation of Rab-7 bacterial autophagosomes during the clearance of S. pyogenes and Q. rickettsia. The transport proteins p62 and NBR1 bind to ubiquitin and LC3 through their UBA (ubiquitin-associated region) and LIR (LC3-interacting region) domains, respectively. Then, ubiquitinated proteins, damaged organelles, and intracellular pathogens are degraded by selective autophagy. It has been found that autophagy can selectively eliminate Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Listeria monocytogenes secrete ActA on the cell surface of bacteria and then recruit Arp2/3 and Ena/rasp proteins to mimic host cell organelles, thereby avoiding ubiquitination and autophagic degradation. The effector of the Shigella type III secretion system damages the phagosome membrane. The damaged phagosome membrane is ubiquitinated, encapsulated, and degraded via the p62 pathway. Damaged phagosome membranes bind to proteins such as Galectin3, NOD1, Ipaf, ASC, Caspase-1, TRAF6, and NEMO, which are specifically related to NF-\u03baB-dependent cytokine storm. Therefore, degradation of bacteria by selective autophagy may have adverse effects on infection control.\n",

Inhibition of mTOR or p38MAP kinase reduces the above enzyme activities, suggesting that autophagy protects cells and reduces apoptosis by enhancing glutamine activity. The endoplasmic reticulum is abundant in Paneth cells compared to other intestinal epithelial cells. Deletion of key autophagic proteins may disrupt organelle renewal and destroy endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. XBP1 is a crucial transcription factor that maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. Paneth cells are abnormally sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress.

The enterosteroids 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1, GLP-2) secreted by EE cells are closely associated with intestinal physiology and pathological function. The number of EE cells and the mode of secretion are related to enteritis. Clinical observations found that the density of polypeptide YY and chromogranin A-expressing (CgA+) cells increased in patients with lymphatic enteritis, and the number of GLP-secreting cells and 5-HT-secreting cells (intestinal chromaffin cells) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increased. Research evidence continues to show that autophagy is involved in the regulation of EE cell function. In the mouse colonic IBD model induced by IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, the number of CgA+ EE cells increased, while the colonic mucosa highly expressed the autophagy-associated proteins LC3-II and ATG5. It is suggested that autophagy is involved in regulating the production and differentiation of CgA+ cells. Deletion of the WD-40 domain of ATG16 in the Drosophila intestinal mucosa leads to dysregulation of the Robo-Slit signaling pathway, resulting in a decrease in the number of mature EE cells. This evidence suggests that Drosophila ATG16 promotes the differentiation of intestinal stem cells into EE cells. Hormones secreted by EE cells are also involved in the regulation of autophagy. In liver cancer cells and lacrimal gland cells, 5-HT is capable of inhibiting autophagy activity. C57BL/6 mice were injected with GLP2 to promote phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein and the mTORC1 signaling pathway downstream of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4e)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Pretreatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin blocked the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the S6 ribosomal protein.

The recruitment of TLRs does not directly activate caspase-1, whereas the maturation of pro-IL-1\u03b2/pro-IL-18 requires caspase-1. Extracellular ATP activates the P2X7 receptor, induces caspase-1 activation, and produces IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 via the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The above activation stress is associated with K+ efflux and impaired lysosomal function.

The GCN2 (generally controlled nonrepressed kinase) knockout mouse model showed increased expression of IL-1\u03b2, enhanced Th17 cell responses, and increased production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in a severe enteritis response. Ravindran et al. found that enteritis was strictly related to the inhibition of autophagy in IECs and APCs. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the anaerobic glycolysis of carbohydrates, such as food residues, are the primary source of energy for IECs and maintain the normal function of the intestinal barrier. As HDAC inhibitors, SCFAs block the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reduce autophagy, thereby alleviating LPS injury in the intestinal barrier.",

It is worth mentioning that the disruption of the normal autophagy pathway increases the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18. Regulation of IL-1\u03b2 processing and secretion is mainly dependent on the activation of caspase-1, which subsequently affects the formation of the inflammasome (Piccioli and Rubartelli 2013). The secretion of IL-1\u03b2 is usually divided into two phases: first, IL-1\u03b2 precursor transcription is induced by LPS, and then inflammatory body assembly and caspase-1 activation are induced by ROS, uric acid crystals or ATP stimulation. Autophagy regulates the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 by at least two different mechanisms. Knockout of ATG7, ATG16L1 or the autophagy gene BECN1, or treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, can inhibit autophagy in macrophages or dendritic cells. Inhibition of autophagy enhances the processing and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 by TLR agonists. The study found that the above effects in murine macrophages and dendritic cells are dependent on TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-\u03b2), mitochondrial ROS and/or mitochondrial DNA and are partially dependent on NLRP3. However, the effects mentioned above in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be dependent on the p38-MAPK signaling pathway but not TRIF. TNF-\u03b1 production is dependent on mitochondrial ROS and then induces oxidative stress. In the absence of ATG7 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells, LPS can promote large-scale transcription of IL-1\u03b2. In LC3B-deficient mice, LPS can produce higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Clinical studies have found that the ATG16L1 polymorphism is closely related to the risk of Crohn\u2019s disease. Sodium dextran sulfate (DSS) is more likely to induce colitis in mice lacking ATG16L1. These results indicate that autophagy may be an essential mechanism for controlling inflammatory responses in vivo.",

Furthermore, after treatment with rapamycin and LPS or PAM3Cys, the level of IL-1\u03b2 precursor in macrophages is reduced. These findings indicate that autophagy can specifically target IL-1\u03b2 precursors to undergo lysosomal degradation and to regulate the expression of IL-1\u03b2 precursors inside the cell. Rapamycin-induced autophagy can also effectively reduce the increase of serum IL-1\u03b2 induced by LPS in mice. Both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce autophagy, which may be a negative feedback loop that regulates IL-1-induced inflammatory responses.

Treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer tunicamycin of wild-type B lymphocytes also caused increased expression of Blimp-1 and IgM \u03bc chain. ATG5-deficient B lymphocytes are capable of synthesizing and secreting a large amount of antibody (Fig. 27.3), which also indicates that autophagy has a certain limiting effect on the synthesis of antibody proteins.\n",

Autophagy needs to meet the high metabolic requirements required for plasma cell differentiation and antibody secretion. In resting B lymphocytes, autophagy is not critical for ATP production. After three days of LPS stimulation, the ATP produced by ATG5-deficient B lymphocytes could not reach 50% of the level in wild-type B lymphocytes, suggesting that more ATG5-deficient B lymphocytes have undergone apoptosis. These results indicate that autophagy is involved in maintaining the energy and survival of B lymphocytes during plasma cell differentiation.",

In a mouse model of antigen-specific immunity, parasitic infection, and mucosal inflammation, knockout of ATG5 in mouse B lymphocytes can significantly reduce the antibody response. Although in vitro experiments have shown that the synthesis and secretion of antibodies by ATG5-deficient B lymphocytes are increased due to the lack of protection from autophagy, more B lymphocytes undergo apoptosis, which attenuates the effect of enhanced antibody secretion. To validate the above hypothesis, the researchers immunized mice with hapten NP-Ficoll, which is capable of continuously activating B lymphocytes. Two weeks after NP-Ficoll immunization, the number of plasma cells in B lymphocyte-specific ATG5 knockout mice did not change compared with wild-type mice, but more NP antibodies were produced. This finding suggests that a single ATG5-deficient plasma cell has higher antibody secretion activity than a wild-type plasma cell. Batista et al. found that under viral infection, autophagy is highly activated in B cells and germinal center cells. Unlike the classical autophagy signaling pathway activated by rapamycin, GC B cells mainly undergo nonclassical autophagy signaling pathways. This indicates that autophagy regulates the activation state of B cells.",

This mechanism allows the in vivo antibody response to persist and is an essential intrinsic mechanism to maintain the niche of bone marrow-derived long-lived plasma cells. Bone marrow-derived CD19\u2212CD138hi plasma cells have more LC3-positive fluorescent plaques. However, compared to wild-type mice, the total amount of antibody in the circulation and the number of bone marrow-derived plasma cells did not change in B lymphocyte-specific ATG5 knockout mice. This phenomenon may be due to the reemergence of many ATG5 transcripts and LC3-positive fluorescent plaques in bone marrow-derived plasma cells B lymphocyte-specific ATG5 knockout mice compared with the B220hiCD138lo cells derived from spleen, suggesting a partial recovery of autophagy in the bone marrow. However, 11 months after immunization with NP-CGG antigen, NP antigen-specific, bone marrow-derived, long-lived plasma cells in B lymphocyte-specific ATG5 knockout mice were reduced by 90% compared to wild-type mice. The reason for the decrease in long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow is due to the increase in plasma cell death because of impaired autophagy function and the decrease in MHC II-restricted antigen-presenting ability dependent on autophagy. Finally, the interactions between B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes are blocked.",

Knocking out ATG7 to block B cell autophagy can inhibit the type II allergic reaction, does not affect the type I allergic reaction, and inhibits the antibody production frequency in Bmems. This finding suggests that targeted autophagy has the potential to clear the Bmems response. The Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) tumor protein EBNA3C is an essential protein for the transformation of primitive B cells and the maintenance of lymphocyte expansion. EBNA3C affects the cell cycle and apoptosis by regulating ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation and gene transcription. Recent studies have found that tumor viruses (such as EBV) promote cell survival by tampering with autophagy. EBNA3C upregulates ATG3, ATG5, and ATG7 gene transcription to activate autophagy (Bhattacharjee et al. 2018). Under conditions of nutrient deprivation, EBNA3C up-regulates tumor suppressor genes such as p27Kip1 to activate autophagy. These findings suggest that EBNA3C acts as a survival mechanism by regulating autophagy and provides a potential therapeutic approach for EBV-induced B-cell lymphoma.",
