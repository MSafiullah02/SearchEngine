Bacterial pathogens were identified with Gram staining and semiquantitative bacterial cultures from sputum and blood samples as well as nasopharyngeal and throat PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.

We then applied class prediction, using the K\u2013nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, with 12 neighbors and a P value ratio cutoff of .5, to identify the top-ranked genes that best discriminated between bacterial and viral infections [9]. Finally, we performed functional gene analyses using a modular analysis, as described elsewhere [17, 19, 20] (module transcript content and annotations are available online at http://www.biir.net/public_wikis/module_annotation/V2_Trial_8_Modules).

Patients with bacterial LRTI demonstrated significant overexpression of modules related to the innate immune response, including inflammation and neutrophils modules, and underexpression of genes regulating the adaptive immunity, such as B- and T-cell modules, as did the viral infection group. However, the latter presented a marked overexpression of the IFN-related modules, which was absent in the bacterial infection group (Figure 3). Furthermore, the plasma cells module was only overexpressed in the viral infection group. For those modules that presented the same trend in the level of expression, we also found differences in magnitude, as was the case with neutrophils (more overexpressed in the bacterial infection group; P < .001) and natural killer cells (more underexpressed in the bacterial infection group; P < .001) modules (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1B). The module based analysis also showed a distinct pattern for the bacterial-viral coinfection group, characterized by relative underexpression of the platelets and monocytes modules (Figure 3) and intermediate expression of inflammation and IFN-related modules compared with the bacterial and viral infection groups (Supplementary Figure 1B).\n",

The K-NN algorithm identified 10 classifier genes that best discriminated bacterial from viral LRTI (Table 2). Eight of those 10 classifiers were IFN-related genes (IFI44, IFIT3, IFI27, RSAD2, OAS2, OASL, IFIT2, and PARP9). Using the 10 classifier genes, leave-one-out cross-validation of the training set correctly classified 21 of 23 samples (91% accuracy; Figure 4A). In the validation analysis (K-NN in the test set), the classifier genes correctly categorized 22 of 23 new patient samples (96% accuracy; Figure 4B). To further confirm these findings, using the 10 classifier genes, we applied an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to a third cohort of patients comprising the 11 patients with bacterial LRTI used in the K-NN training set and a new independent set of 12 patients with viral LRTI. In this analysis, 22 of 23 patients (96%) were correctly classified (Figure 4C).\n",

Our results showed that a distinct systemic host response is elicited in each infection group (ie, bacterial vs viral) and can be detected in the blood and at an early stage of the disease, as reported elsewhere for children [9, 10, 17, 22]. In agreement with other studies using gene expression analyses in patients with respiratory viral infections [10, 23], we observed that the major difference between the groups was found in the IFN response, with the viral infection group showing the highest expression level. Indeed, the 10 transcripts identified with the K-NN algorithm as the best classifiers included 8 IFN-related genes, allowing us to categorize patients with bacterial versus viral LRTI with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (92%).",

C-reactive protein was considered a useful tool to distinguish bacterial from viral infections [7], but studies have shown [25] that this biomarker lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity. In addition, although there are promising results supporting the applicability of PCT as a prognostic biomarker, its value as a diagnostic tool is still under debate. Its diagnostic accuracy in LRTI is variable and depends on the cutoff values used and the conditions under study, such as community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or bronchitis [26]. Our results indicate that the 10 classifier genes have superior sensitivity and similar specificity compared with serum PCT, demonstrating the potential value of transcriptional profiling as a diagnostic tool to differentiate viral from bacterial LRTI in the adult population. Importantly, these findings are in agreement with the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society recommendations for improvement in the diagnosis of LRTI, because the symptoms of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia overlap with viral causes of pneumonia as well as exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [27].",

In addition, blood samples are convenient samples for diagnostic and prognostic analysis, because they are routinely obtained from patients with LRTI and do not require additional, more invasive interventions. Our results were obtained from a single cohort of 118 patients with LRTI hospitalized in a single center. It would be necessary to validate our findings in independent cohorts. Although we attempted to identify a biosignature in those patients with documented bacterial-viral coinfections, the small number of patients and the heterogeneity of the viruses and bacteria identified did not allow us yet to identify transcripts that can separate them from the other 2 groups.

            "text": "Figure 4.: Transcriptional profile discrimination between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The 10 top-ranked genes that best differentiated bacterial from viral LRTI (Table 2) were identified, after use of a supervised learning K\u2013nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm with 12 neighbors and a P value ratio cutoff of .5. A, Use of those genes in a training set correctly classified 21 of 23 individual subjects (91.3%). B, Cross-validation in a test set correctly classified 95.6% of patients. C, Validation in a third cohort, applying an unsupervised hierarchical clustering (distance method), correctly classified 95.6% of patients.",
