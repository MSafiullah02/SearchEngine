This study, involving 23 countries across 6 continents, highlighted that patients who experience RSV-associated mortality in low-income countries are different from those in high-income countries.

Unlike the aforementioned studies, we included children up to 18 years old. When only considering children <2 years old, the median age of death was 7 months in children in our case series compared with 3.5 months in Prill et al's study [9] . When only considering children <5 years old, the median age of death was 9 months in our case series compared to 7 months in Scheltema et al's study [11] . Therefore, it appears that the population in our case series was older than previous studies. Of note, more than one-third of our identified cases occurred in those >2 years old. RSV infection in older children may become more relevant with medical and technological advances, enabling patients with underlying complex medical conditions (eg, congenital heart disease and ventilator-dependent lung disease) to live longer while remaining vulnerable to severe RSV disease. Interestingly, however, the patients >2 years of age did not have more known risk factors for severe RSV infection compared to their younger counterparts, suggesting there may be other factors predisposing them to RSV-associated mortality. It is unclear why those older than 2 years had shorter durations of admission to hospital (P = .048) and to the ICU (P = .014) prior to death. Possibilities may include more rapid progression of disease or more delayed presentation to hospital. Nonetheless, nearly half of the deaths in our study occurred in infants, confirming this population as most vulnerable among pediatric patients, although older children may account for an increasing proportion of RSV-associated mortality in the future, which definitely warrants further study. Most deaths occurred in children with recognized risk factors for severe RSV. Reviews examining case fatality rates (CFR) among RSV hospitalizations have consistently found higher rates in patients with underlying medical conditions such as prematurity (CFR range, 0-6.1%), chronic lung disease (3.5%-23%), and congenital heart defects (2%-37%) [5, 6] . In contrast, the CFR in those with no risk factors in high-income countries has been found to be <1% [10, 11] and is often cited as <0.5% [3] in more recent reviews.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 292, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 444, "end": 448, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2050, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2051, "end": 2053, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2161, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2162, "end": 2165, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2197, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In our study, almost 1 in 5 patients had no known underlying risk factors for severe RSV disease. Prill et al also revealed a similar finding, with 19% of children with RSV-associated death having no risk factor for severe disease [9] . When we compared the group with known risk factors to those with no known risk factors, the latter had a trend toward shorter duration of admission prior to death (13 days vs 27 days; P = .054). Again, it is unclear whether this is due to more rapid progression of disease or more delayed presentation to hospital. Patients with no known risk factors also tended to have more viral coinfections (30.8% vs 9.7%; P = .064), be older (median age of death, 21.5 months vs 10 months; P = .922), have infections outside of the typical RSV season (21.4% vs 12.3%; P = .401), and receive ECMO (21.4% vs 6.2%; P = .102). Other investigators have found that, in children with RSV-associated mortality, previously healthy children were younger than those with comorbidities (3.8-4 months vs 11 months) and occur more commonly within the RSV season (91%-97% vs 39%), in contrast to what we observed in our study [11] . Factors associated with severe disease outcomes such as mortality in previously healthy patients are largely undetermined. While overall small numbers of patients make it difficult to draw any concrete conclusions regarding these comparative findings at this point, it would be worthwhile to explore this further in future studies. Possible factors that have been considered include, but are not limited to: viral load [12, 13] , viral coinfections [14] , and immune response-related genetic susceptibility markers [15] [16] [17] [18] . A prospective surveillance study across 8 Canadian pediatric centers in 2005 found that viral pathogens were the most common cause of healthcare-acquired febrile respiratory infections, with RSV being the most frequently identified agent [19] . One-third of our cases were deemed to have been acquired in hospital (HAIs). Our study may have overestimated the number of HAIs, as the incubation period of RSV is 2-8 days, but we used a cutoff of >72 hours into hospital admission.

Another limitation is that the causative role of RSV in death was based solely on retrospective chart review; the direction of this bias could either be an overestimation or underestimation of RSV-associated deaths. The use of ICD codes to identify cases may underestimate the number of RSV-associated deaths. In this study, this would be unlikely, especially if RSV was thought to play a major role in the death. Such cases would have been captured by the ICD coding and reviewed by the study team.
