Disputable food risk issues such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), hormones and antibiotics in food, and mercury and dioxin pollution in food involve high scientific uncertainty.1 Moreover, due the intrinsic, fast-spreading, cross-boundary nature of these risks, they form a globalization of risks\u2019 (Giddens 2002), or globalized food risks. In the face of disputes over the nature of globalized food risks, the governance capacity of governments is facing challenges of its own; on the one hand governments need to propose efficient regulatory measures, while on the other hand through a process of acknowledging the high level of scientific uncertainty related to these food risks and the added risk that this uncertainty produces, they also need to adopt governance measures to gain public trust.",

In other words, the governments risk assessment, risk communication and valuing of public risk perceptions need to become the equal basis of future governance strategy. However, the question is, is such a shift in the governance paradigm possible in newly emerging industrialized countries which are driven by the primary motivation of economic development? Do they have the capacity to face the challenges of social transformation and gain public trust and support?",

With rapid economic developments occurring in newly industrialized countries, it is also important to find out how to manage uncertainties and the impact of globalized health, ecological and food risks. Most importantly, this article attempts to understand in detail how government practices impact risk governance by analyzing its risk decision-making, risk assessment and risk communication models. This means that the government is a crucial agent of risk governance, influencing public risk perception and public trust. Therefore, as different countries research public risk perception, public trust and government governance capacity, they not only measure public attitudes towards disputable risks but also analyze public confidence, reactions and perceptions to government actions and discourses. An example of this is the survey the EU undertook to analyze EU citizens\u2019 risk perception and public trust in biotechnology in 2000, 2002, and 2005. As for globalized food risk threats and disputes, the EU also conducted the Eurobarometer survey series in its member states and published the results in 2006.",

In order to enhance the depth of this cross-national comparison, this paper will also conduct transnational comparison with individual countries namely the UK and Germany both of which have conducted studies to measure the impact of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and GMOs in the 1990s. The UK is the best example for analysis, due to the significance of its disputes over BSE in the 1990s, then the rise of the GMO debate in 2003. Germany was affected by the Belgium dioxin scandal, BSE diffusion and GMO disputes in the 1990s as well. For these reasons, these two countries were selected for comparison.",

From the above results, it can be observed that there is a gap in terms of public trust in the governments\u2019 governance capacity between Taiwan and other regions, particularly for public appraisal of public authorities\u2019 actions with regards to food safety risks (TW/EU32), with about 80% of Taiwanese respondents indicating they believed such actions insufficient.",

            "text": "From the international comparisons, it is possible to observe that whether for risk communication, risk individualization, risk perception, legal information of food safety or public trust in governments\u2019 risk governance capacity, survey results from Taiwan were surprising because they showed evidence of problems in global food risk governance and risk communication. Usually, in normal risk perception surveys, the public\u2019s dissatisfaction and distrust are comparatively high during periods of risk related disputes but once the dispute is resolved the level of distrust will gradually be restored.11 However, while this has been the norm in food risk surveys, in the Taiwan survey it was observed that the level of doubt and distrust surrounding the government\u2019s governance capacity was very high. Synthetically speaking, about 70\u201380% of Taiwanese respondents agreed that they worried that the government may conceal risk information (Section I). Similarly, 70\u201380% of the Taiwanese respondents agreed that the problem of risk individualization is very serious (Section II). Compared to citizens of the EU, UK, and Germany, Taiwanese respondents expressed a stronger public perception of risks such as BSE, GMOs, weight gain, food additives, bacteria contamination, chemical substances formed in cooking process, dioxin or mercury pollution in foods, antibiotics or hormones in meats, pesticide residues and bird flu virus, averaging around 70\u201385% (Section III). In particular, for risks such as bacteria contamination in foods (TW/EU10), dioxin or mercury pollution in foods (TW/EU12), hormone or antibiotics in meats (TW/EU13) and pesticide residues (TW/EU13), as many as 90% of Taiwanese respondents expressed concern. However, although these issues also attracted public attention in the EU, UK, and Germany, only around 50\u201360% of the respondents revealed any worries. The results of this survey demonstrate a long term sense of dissatisfaction towards the government\u2019s governance style, particularly in relation to the lack of transparency of information; the incapability of the system to resolve risk; the increased pressure that the failure of the system has on the individual; a strong sense of worry in relation to the regulation of food pollution. Such results reinforce the concerns with the governance structural problems of newly emerging countries which was mentioned at the beginning of this research. At the same time this survey\u2019s results also reveal some distinctive aspects: the geographical and globalized levels are both worthy of a more detailed discussion; geographically, as a result of the fact that even until now there is still a lack of academic writing about the risk governance and society of many East Asian countries, it is therefore impossible to ascertain whether or not the phenomenon seen in Taiwan are prevalent in the area as a whole; at least on a globalized level, it is possible to clearly reflect on the conflict facing newly industrialized countries as they cope with the assault of globalization; on the one hand their governments must strive to catch up, lagging behind but trying to learn high tech industrialization and economic development (Wang 2007) while intentionally neglecting issues of social risk (Chou ibid.), while on the other hand, when their society experiences the reality of globalized risk, being limited by the limitations of their technological governance model which in turn leads to strong criticism and sense of dissatisfaction. Such a dilemma reveals the distinct nature of governance while also showing the high level of anxiety in the public.",

With respect to public trust in governments\u2019 risk governance capacity, Taiwanese respondents expressed a greater degree of distrust compared with those surveyed in the EU, UK, and Germany, averaging 50\u201360% (Section V). Finally as many as 80% of respondents showed dissatisfaction with the governments\u2019 risk governance capacity (TW/EU32). Overall, these statistics demonstrate the confrontation between the government and the public brought to a head by global food risk issues. Even though risks such as BSE, GMOs, and dioxin contamination originated from the UK and Belgium, before disseminating around Europe (for example, to Germany), we can see that EU members had made efforts in risk governance (L\u00f6fstedt 2002; European Commission 2002) to improve public trust. At the beginning of this research, in light of past experience, it was pointed out that there existed problems with the risk governance structure in Taiwan, and accordingly the governments serious failings in not valuing the public\u2019s risk perceptions, transparency of information channels and communication and involvement with and of the public. The delayed and hidden response of the regulatory culture that this type of governance structure created, led to the public, in times of disputes finding themselves ignorant of how to respond and the effects of this emerged as a high level of anxiety in the public and a high level of distrust towards the government. The results of this survey have not only reasserted the original hypothesis of this paper but have also gone one step further in verifying it. Again, in the historical context of an authoritarian regime, the factors that cause this phenomenon can be discussed in three dimensions: expert politics, governance and assessment ideologies, and social amplification of risk.",

In this context, technocracy controlled by science elites dominated technological and risk policies for a long time in Taiwan. Despite experiencing the third wave of democratization in the 1980s, for complicated technological and risk affairs that are accessible to the public, authoritarian governance structure continued to function as before. In other words, the authoritarian culture and expert politics have fused together to create a scientific regime which makes decisions without consulting others, possessing the dominant influence in risk related policy making. When carrying out risk assessment this scientific regime is equally assertive in its assertion that positivist scientific led decision making is the only acceptable model; in the process seriously neglecting public risk communication and public risk perception. Therefore, the double entanglement of authoritarian expert politics and positivist scientific assessment has created an equally distinct scientific and risk regulatory culture. Against this background, the government became a risk regulator that was active in risk governance but seriously amiss in its social rationality. This has raised considerable disputes.",

This governance model accumulatively formed a special structural risk governance culture and regulatory problems in Taiwan, consequently creating tensions between state and society. From the perspective of social amplification of risk, the long-term, structurally delayed and hidden risk regulation is quite disadvantageous to sensitive and vulnerable public perception. In particular, the state often institutionally ignores risk communication and thus public doubts increase, as does pubic distrust. This research shows that, to certain degree, the public are worried the state may conceal related risk information in the future. Also, in this case, the public perceived that individuals within the public were forced to shoulder high risk responsibilities. Such distinct risk governance culture can be shown to be the reason why Taiwanese citizens have such a high degree of risk perception and worry. Compared to the EU, UK, and Germany, the failure of the government in its responsibilities to global risk disputes such as food contamination and food additive limitation attracted greater attention from Taiwanese citizens. And Taiwanese citizens expressed lower confidence in government governance capacity.",

For the EU, UK, and Germany, targeted food risk issues continue to attracted public attention; however, they expressed positive attitudes towards the authorities\u2019 governance capacity, which implies that the EU\u2019s active reforms in technological decision-making and communication and action models from 2001 have been successful. However, for some advanced democratic continental countries, the legitimacy of decision-making is still being challenged and in need of prompt improvement. While for newly industrialized countries, with their special governance structure and regulatory cultures, the social engineering of risk governance encounters greater challenges in terms of value paradigm and structure change. As the state (expert politics) and society (social rationality) is in a high state of confrontation, public distrust in risk disputes continues, and a risk governance paradigm shift is occurring. Through institutional resolution upon the occurrence of consecutive risk issues, public participation, information transparency and risk communication should be included in a democratic decision-making process. This is a lesson for newly industrialized countries when handling global technological risk challenges. It is also a crucial fight to improve democratization.",
