This finding is widely accepted to be attributable to destruction of hematopoietic progenitor cells of the various leukocyte types primarily in the bone marrow, but also in other lymphoproliferative organs such as the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen, resulting in inadequate compensation for the massive demand for leukocytes (specifically neutrophils) in the inflamed gastrointestinal tract.\n10\n The high mortality in dogs with severe leukopenia can largely be attributed to their high susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections that can lead to septicemia.\n10\n The results of this study indicate that a WBC \u2265 4.5 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, a lymphocyte count \u2265 1.0 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, a monocyte count \u2265 0.15 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, and an eosinophil count \u2265 0.10 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL as well as the presence of a left shift, as early as 24 hours after admission and commencement of treatment, are accurate predictors of a better outcome in CPV enteritis.

Potgieter found that leukopenia was mostly because of severe neutropenia and that the lymphocyte counts decreased to only 50% of normal values; he concluded that neutrophils were the most important leukocyte to monitor. Mason et al,\n13\n however, reported that leukopenia should not be used as the sole criterion of prognosis, and McCaw et al\nd\n found that neutropenia (even when very severe) was not a significant prognostic indicator. Only a few of these studies included serial CBC. In this study, we found several significant differences in WBC and differential leukocyte counts between puppies that survived and those that did not survive. The fact that we may be dealing with 2 different strains of viruses (ie, CPV\u20102a or CPV\u20102b) is a possible explanation for the differences in leukocyte numbers. Because none of the above\u2010mentioned studies determined the strain of virus that caused disease, and because the specific viral strain was not determined in our study, it would be impossible to comment on this possibility. This study has shown that marked leukopenia, lymphopenia, monocytopenia, and eosinopenia as well as the absence of a left shift could be indicators of a poor prognosis as early as 24 hours after treatment has started.",

Survivors, however, developed a degenerative left shift compared with nonsurvivors. This finding could be an indication that the bone marrow of survivors was less affected by the virus, that tissue demand in nonsurvivors was more profound, or that the disease process was too acute for a bone marrow response to occur in those that did not survive.",

The puppies that survived had a significant increase in lymphocytes between the time of admission and 24 hours postadmission, and the count remained significantly higher than that of nonsurvivors at all time points thereafter. This finding was even more significant statistically than the WBC count and probably contributed substantially to the leukopenia, making the lymphocyte count a very important leukocyte parameter to monitor during the course of the disease to determine prognosis in CPV enteritis.",

Monocytosis is a common finding in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, whereas monocytopenia is rarely seen and of little clinical importance.\n2\n, \n9\n, \n11\n, \n21\n Although monocytes and neutrophils share a common progenitor cell, the time taken to produce a monocyte in the bone marrow (3 days) is much shorter than the time taken to produce a neutrophil (6 days).\n3\n, \n21\n, \n25\n Therefore, the recovery of monocyte numbers will precede that of neutrophils in the blood. This is especially true in the panleukopenia seen secondary to CPV infection where monocytopenia followed by a recovering monocyte count precedes the return of neutrophil production. Thus, monitoring the monocyte count in the blood is beneficial in evaluating the recovery from a leukopenic state in patients suffering from CPV enteritis.\n3\n, \n21\n, \n23\n Monocytopenia in nonsurvivors was most severe (<0.15 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) at admission and at 24 and 48 hours postadmission. Not only are monocyte numbers affected in CPV enteritis, but in a study by Decaro et al\n24\n it appeared that the phagocytic ability of these cells was also affected. The study looked at 2 pups over 2 weeks that were naturally infected with canine parvovirus type 1 (CPV 1). The CPV 1 infection led to a marked reduction of monocyte phagocytosis in both pups. Monocyte\u2010mediated killing also was impaired, and in 1 pup this function was completely absent. In this study, more than half of the puppies (survivors and nonsurvivors) had no morphological evidence of monocyte activity (such as cytoplasmic basophilia and vacuolization) during the 3\u2010day evaluation period. Thus, impaired monocyte function could be a factor contributing further to susceptibility to secondary infections.",

In a study on basal cortisol as a prognostic indicator in CPV enteritis, Schoeman et al\n27\n found no difference in the mean basal cortisol (MBC) concentrations between survivors and nonsurvivors at admission. But, the survivors showed a marked reduction in MBC at 24 and 48 hours postadmission, whereas the nonsurvivors showed no reduction in MBC concentrations between admission and 48 hours postadmission. This suggests that patients that are critically ill, such as the puppies with CPV that did not survive, have high MBC concentrations that may account for the very low eosinophil counts. In nonsurvivors, the mean eosinophil count remained < 0.1 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (the lower limit of the reference interval) on all days, serving as a good prognostic indicator in CPV enteritis, specifically at 48 hours postadmission.",
