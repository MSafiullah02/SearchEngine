Immobilization due to prolonged intensive care unit admission in severely ill patients as well as a hypercoagulable state may play a role. The latter one has been previously described to occur in other severe infections and thought to be triggered by an acute inflammatory state, hypoxia and endothelial cell dysfunction (2) . The hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 has been confirmed in a study by Han et al, which revealed higher levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen degradation products in comparison to control group. Indeed, PTE has been reported in patients suffering from COVID-19 (2) . Moreover, postmortem examination of lungs has revealed occlusion and microthrombosis of small pulmonary vessels (1) .",

            "text": "Diagnosis of PTE is challenging in patients with COVID-19. Clinical symptoms and signs including low grade fever, cough and dyspnea are non-specific for PTE. Although raised D-dimer levels have been reported in several articles specially in intensive care unit admitted patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (3), the role of D-dimer in diagnosis of PTE is controversial (1, 4, 5) . Furthermore, findings of unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of lungs, the widely applied modality with high sensitivity (6) , are nonspecific for COVID-19. Similarly, manifestations of PTE are nonspecific in an unenhanced CT scan. On the other hand, the increased risk of acute kidney injury in patients suffering from COVID-19 (7), limits the liberal administration of contrast agents and acquisition of the CT angiography of pulmonary arteries. In a large retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration rate under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively, with acute kidney injury occurring in 5.1% patients (7) . The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) may thus be higher in shocked patients with severe COVID-19 since multiple risk factors, including dehydration, acute tubular necrosis, direct invasion of renal tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome of novel coronavirus 2, and cytokine storm (8) may exacerbate the effects of contrast on renal function.",
