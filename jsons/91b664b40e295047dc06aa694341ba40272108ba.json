EPE was first reported in horses in 1982 by Duhamel and Wheeldon (1982) . Since 1996, many more reports of sporadic cases (Williams et al. 1996; Frank et al. 1998; Brees et al. 1999; Schumacher et al. 2000; Bihr 2003; McClintock and Collins 2004; Deprez et al. 2005; Dauvillier et al. 2006; Sampieri et al. 2006; Wuersch et al. 2006; Feary et al. 2007 ) and outbreaks on breeding farms (Lavoie et al. 2000; McGurrin et al. 2007; Frazer 2008; Merlo et al. 2009 ) have been described.

Moreover, phenotypic characterisation of outer membrane proteins and immunoblots of different L. intracellularis isolates using several antibodies and more sensitive molecular characterisations of the L. intracellularis genome demonstrated only minor differences among isolates. None of these differences appears to be antigenically relevant.

The route of infection for weanling foals remains unknown, however, in comparison to other species, a faeco-oral route is suspected, via contaminated feed and/or water. In pigs, the incubation period is 2-3 weeks following exposure; however, this period has not been determined for horses. Because of the wide host range of PE, numerous potential reservoir hosts exist. Lawsonia intracellularis has recently been detected by PCR from the faeces of a variety of domestic and wild animals (Herbst et al. 2003; Tomanov\u00e1 et al. 2003; Pusterla et al. 2008a) . Despite an ever-increasing range of host species, L. intracellularis is currently not to be considered a zoonotic disease. The role of clinically and subclinically infected horses in the transmission of L. intracellularis needs further investigation.",

Foals with EPE may also have concurrent disorders such as respiratory tract infections, gastric ulcerations and intestinal parasitism. One must keep in mind that signs of EPE may resemble those of more common gastrointestinal disorders such as parasitism, bacterial infections (Clostridium spp., Salmonella spp., Rhodococcus equi), rotavirus, coronavirus, ulcerations, sand accumulation and intestinal obstruction.

Several PCR assays have been developed for the detection of L. intracellularis in faeces. The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR technique in faecal samples has been evaluated for pigs and showed variable sensitivity and consistently high specificity (Guedes et al. 2002; Jacobson et al. 2004) . Sensitivity is affected by sample quality and the presence of inhibitory factors in faeces. PCR appears to reliably demonstrate L. intracellularis in the faeces of clinically affected horses early in the course of the disease but often fails to detect the organism in the faeces of subclinically infected animals, animals with prolonged course of disease or foals treated with antimicrobials prior to faecal analysis. Animals exposed to L. intracellularis develop serum IgG antibodies specific for the organism. Current methods used for serological diagnosis of PE employ L. intracellularis cultured in enterocytes or a preparation of L. intracellularis on slides as the antigen. Staining of bacteria is either by a fluorescent (indirect fluorescent antibody) or peroxidaselabelled (immunoperoxidase monolayer assay) secondary antibody. One must keep in mind that a positive serological result may represent exposure to infection rather than disease. Although no commercially available serological assay has yet been systemically evaluated for the equine species, serological assays have proven useful N. Pusterla and C. Gebhart 417",

Gross lesions are not evident in all cases of EPE and may often be overlooked. Severe PE is diagnosed by the demonstration of hyperplasia of the crypt glands with an increased number of mitotic figures and absence of goblet cells in routine haematoxylin and eosin preparations; however, for visualisation of the bacteria in the cytoplasm of enterocytes, special stains are necessary. The histological lesions of PE are unique and inflammation is not normally a hallmark of the disease. Warthin-Starry silver stain allows the detection of the bacteria in histological sections, improving the diagnostic sensitivity, but the technique has limitations when applied to autolysed and necrotic samples. Immunohistochemistry procedures, using post mortem tissue or biopsy material, with an antibody specific for L. intracellularis have been used successfully to diagnosis EPE (Fig 7) .",

            "text": "It is important to treat affected animals early, before lesions become advanced resulting in marked weight loss and critically low serum protein values. Treatment of EPE in horses involves the use of antimicrobials such as macrolides alone or in combination with rifampin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline or doxycycline administered for 3 weeks. The choice of antimicrobial in the treatment of EPE should take into account the risk of inducing disturbance of the gastrointestinal flora and renal toxicity. This is especially a concern when treating older foals with severe hypoalbuminaemia. In addition, supportive care such as i.v. fluids, plasma transfusion, parenteral nutrition and antiulcer drugs are commonly used to treat affected foals. Concurrent medical conditions should also be addressed. Rapid clinical improvement following treatment is to be expected, although it may take weeks for the hypoproteinaemia to resolve. Spontaneous recovery of clinically affected foals has not been documented and treated foals usually survive the disease. Long-term sequelae have not been reported; however, clinically affected and successfully treated foals sell for an average of 68% less than the average price of unaffected foals by the same stallion (Frazer 2008) .",
