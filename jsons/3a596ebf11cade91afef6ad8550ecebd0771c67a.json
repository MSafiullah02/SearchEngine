Although it is still very desirable to use commercially produced quality hand rubs and single use medical gloves and face masks, the current shortage of some articles is so profound that it results in uncertainty among healthcare workers (HCWs) whether it is safe for them to care for COVID-19 patients. Despite well above-average early replenishment of inventories, further supplies in sufficient amounts are questionable due to uncertain production and logistics. Protection of frontline healthcare workers is crucial to ensure [2] .

Coronaviruses are inactivated at 60\u00b0C in 30 min so that thermal disinfection may be an option [12] . The construction of the face mask may allow thermal disinfection [13] . But some masks may lose their filtration capacity or the fitting in the face resulting in less protection for the user [13] . That is why it is so important to have a statement from the manufacturer. The WHO indicates that reprocessing masks or respirators should only be considered when there is critical shortage or lack of them [2] .
