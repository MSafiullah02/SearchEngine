Hospitalised adults frequently have coagulopathy with elevated fibrinogen early in infection, while non-survivors often develop disseminated intravascular coagulation10 and a hyperferritinaemic inflammatory state.13 To our knowledge, TAMOF, which exists on a spectrum of inflammatory phenotypes,2 has not yet been associated with COVID-19. Beyond ferritin concentration (table), we were not routinely monitoring inflammatory markers or cytokine levels in our paediatric patients with COVID-19, as seems to be more commonly practiced in adult patients. Nevertheless, our patient's clinical course seems to have improved with plasma exchange, consistent with data from past observational studies in paediatric TAMOF.3, 5 We believe that the prevalence of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and organ failure in paediatric patients and the utility of plasma exchange in severe COVID-19 cases require further investigation.14\n",

The risk of a nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection was very low, given the absence of the infection in our hospital at the time and the extensive use of personal protective equipment, including precautions against possible airborne transmission, when tending to any patient with a high index of suspicion for COVID-19. Although SARS-CoV-2 is often undetectable early in the course of infection, a post-hoc review revealed that the first negative test in this patient was due to a laboratory error; repeat RT-PCR analysis of both samples (from hospital days 0 and 3) returned detectable quantities of SARS-CoV-2 that were consistent between the two timepoints. Notably, our patient presented with no upper respiratory symptoms, and testing was done on samples attained from nasopharyngeal swabs. Although our assays are unable to provide truly quantitative results, both samples suggested a qualitatively low\u2013moderate viral load. Following this case, to increase the likelihood of detection of SARS-CoV-2, our institution has implemented the practice of obtaining a second test for the virus at least 24 h after admission for all critically ill patients with a negative first test and high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.",
