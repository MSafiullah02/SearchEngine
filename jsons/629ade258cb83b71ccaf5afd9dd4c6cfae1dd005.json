            "text": "Clinical findings in severe COVID-19 cases indicate a dysregulated innate immune response with an overexuberant inflammation, characterized by a cytokine storm syndrome that is responsible for the associated respiratory failure, multiorgan failure and lethality. Analysis of cytokine profiles in COVID-19 patients shows some similarities to secondary haemophagocytic syndrome (sHPS), with increased IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GM-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\uf061 and TNF-\uf061 [2] . In this uncommon and potentially fatal disorder, severe hyperinflammation is caused by uncontrolled proliferation and activation of macrophages, which secrete high amounts of inflammatory cytokines and show increased phagocytic activity [3] . Causes for this pathological immune activation can be genetic or secondary under sporadic conditions such as viral infection. This virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) has been extensively studied, with severe complications often resulting in multiorgan failure and death. During several influenza pandemics such as 2009 influenza A H1N1, 1918 H1N1 and 1998 H5N1, VAHS was shown to represent an important contributor to associated respiratory failure and high lethality rates [4, 5] . Findings from these cases showed involvement of a massive macrophage activation and rapid occurrence of multi-organ failure.",

This would identify these cells as potential therapeutic targets in severe patients. Furthermore, SARS-Cov1 has demonstrated ability to infect primary human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro; antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of macrophages by non-neutralizing antiviral antibodies has been shown during other coronavirus infections [8] , skewing macrophages to a hyper-activated pathogenic response.",

Hence, a therapeutic combination of GM-CSF and IL-6 blockade in severe COVID-19 patients could avoid pulmonary complications and respiratory failure by inhibiting monocyte-macrophage recruitment/differentiation to the lung and blocking the main mediator of inflammatory response. Blockade of GM-CSF could even be delivered at initial phases of severe disease (upon admission) to avoid currently no licensed drug for inhibition of GM-CSF. However, there are two drugs currently in clinical development phase being assayed in RA and other inflammatory conditions: namilumab and otilimab. Namilumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the GM-CSF ligand, developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals currently in phase II for treatment in axial spondyloarthritis and with good phase II results in RA and plaque psoriasis. Otilimab, a fully human antibody against GM-CSF, developed by biotechnology company MorphoSys in cooperation withGlaxoSmithKline, is currently in phase III start in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
