Contrast studies have a low diagnostic yield and may be hazardous for the critically ill patient. They may also interfere with other diagnostic studies (i.e., endoscopy, angiography). Special tests may be required in the evaluation of acute GI bleeding. These include a. Selective angiography may be used as a diagnostic as well as therapeutic tool (e.g., embolization). A bleeding rate at the time of the procedure \u22650.5 mL/min is needed for diagnosis. b. Radionuclide scans are sensitive in detecting lesions with lower bleeding rates. 6. Endoscopy is indicated in the vast majority of patients requiring ICU admission for GI bleeding. a. Upper endoscopy is indicated when blood is obtained from the NG tube or when frank hematemesis is present. b. Flexible sigmoidoscopy should be performed initially if lower GI bleeding is suspected. If this is not diagnostic, colonoscopy should be considered. c. Special endoscopic procedures may be required (i.e., wireless video capsule endoscopy, push enteroscopy, double balloon enteroscopy) D. Initial ICU Management 1. As in any critically ill patient, the management of acute GI bleeding starts with assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).
