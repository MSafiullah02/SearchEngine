            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pathogen causing an enteric disease that is especially severe in piglets, among which mortality can reach up to 90% (Pensaert, 1999). The most thoroughly studied of these agents associated with PED is coronavirus (CV) 777, first identified by Pensaert and DeBouck (1978) in Belgium and the United Kingdom and characterized by acute diarrhea disease affecting pigs of all age groups. PED is one of the most important causes of economic loss in Asia countries, especially in Korea and China, mainly due to its high prevalence, compared to the rare incidence of transmissible gastroenteritis and the asymptomatic characteristics of the Rotavirus infections (Carvajal et al., 1995).",

Morbidity is variable in sow but high (approaching 98.7%) in suckling pigs, which are most severely affected and exhibit vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration. Mortality in piglets may be 50% or higher. Most fattening pigs and weaners recover from the disease, but some may remain unthrifty. In adults, anorexia, lethargy, and diarrhea are seen, but mortality is very low. Comparing high morbidity, the mortality is usually low in adult pigs (3%), which can recover within in a week. However, when suckling pigs are involved, mortality is normally about 50% and can reach up to 90% in very severe outbreaks (Pensaert, 1999).",

Now there are no effective commercial vaccines or specific treatment available and the only measures to control the disease are those directed to preventing the entrance of the virus on the farm (Pensaert, 1999). Induction of maternal immunity by artificial spread of the virus to pregnant sow is a common procedure used to reduce mortality and economical impact of the outbreak on the farm (Pensaert, 1999). Hofmann and Wyler (1988) described PEDV isolation for the first time in cell culture using Vero cells and trypsin-supplemented medium. Since then, several diagnostic methods have been employed for the detection of both PEDV antigen and its antibodies (Callbaut et al., 1982, Carvajal et al., 1995, Debouck et al., 1981, Hofmann and Wyler, 1990, Knuchel et al., 1992, Kweon et al., 1997, Van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra, 1991). The lack of in vitro-propagated PEDV made the diagnosis of infections extremely complicated and for this reason the available tests were of limited applicability. Virus-antigen-based serologic tests were used in screening for TGEV and PEDV (Knuchel et al., 1992, de Arriba et al., 2002) but the recombinant proteins for sero-diagnosis for PEDV have not been investigated. Examination with sensitive techniques such as immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation showed that PEDV has antigenic determinants in common with feline infectious peritonitis virus and these determinants are located on the nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, it was suggested that the N protein could be a suitable candidate for the detection of PED virus specific antibodies and diagnosis of PEDV.",

Five hours after IPTG induction, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication.

In contrast, maximum absorbance value was determined at a concentration of 100 ng/well, while absorbance decreased with increasing antigen concentrations above 100 ng/well (Fig. 3). As the results of comparison for the sensitivity and specificity, a concentration of 100 ng/well was used for recombinant N protein ELISA. Because the absorbance values between positive and negative sample was not significantly different at 50,100-fold dilutions of primary sera, a 100-fold dilution was chosen for subsequent assays (Fig. 4).",

But PEDV is still difficult to isolate in cell culture. Therefore, their application was clearly limited and large-scale serological surveys could not be performed. The application of ELISA for serological survey was firstly reported by Hofmann and Wyler (1990). Their approach, however, had a disadvantage that PEDV particles were purified by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation before being used as ELISA antigens. A less complicated method of antigen preparation would facilitate the application of ELISA for large-scale serological testing. For the antibody ELISA, antigen consists of semi-purified virus, pig cell cultivated (Callbaut et al., 1982, Carvajal et al., 1995, Kweon et al., 1994) or S, E and N viral protein extracted from infected Vero cells (Knuchel et al., 1992).
