Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In order to address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, a webserver to enable simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are presented in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis.

We provide a webserver (http://covseq.baidu.com/) to allow rapid analysis of custom sequences without any programming. The web interface includes an interactive genome visualizer and tabulated displays of genetic variants and ORF predictions. All results can be downloaded for downstream analysis.

Upon receiving custom sequences, CoV-Seq identifies gene boundaries and genetic variants and displays them alongside a full-length genome ( Figure 1B ). Users interact with the genome by dragging the zoom bar to adjust the magnification and the position bar to pan along the genome. When the genome window contains less than 150 nucleotides, letters will appear to indicate both the nucleotide bases and amino acid residues. Hovering over gene bodies or variants will trigger pop-up windows for relevant information ( Figure 1B red box). Clicking on an ORF brings up three tables. A first table shows all variants and their positions, alleles, and ORFs in which they belong ( Figure 1C ). A second table shows ORF annotations obtained by aligning input sequences against the reference sequence and transferring annotations from Genbank ( Figure 1D ). A third table shows nucleotide and protein sequences for the selected ORF. All tables can be downloaded for further analysis. ",

We filter these genomes using a lenient cutoff of 25,000 nucleotide because it removes distinctly incomplete genomes while retains complete genomes ( Figure S1 ). Both NCBI and EMBL are part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and therefore contain duplicate submissions, which we remove by comparing the Accession IDs. Further, dual submissions can appear in both GISAID and INSDC under different Accession IDs. We consider two submissions as suspect duplications if they have identical genomic sequences. These suspect duplications are marked in the metadata but not removed because it is possible for an identical strain to infect multiple patients. We perform pairwise alignment against the reference sequence NC_045512.2 using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and use a custom Python script for variant calling. We left-normalize each variant with bcftools (Li, 2011) and remove samples with too many variants indicative of sequencing error. We use a lenient cutoff of 150 variants because it removes samples with extremely large numbers of variants while keeping most samples ( Figure S2 ). During postprocessing, we remove multi-allelic sites because these sites are more likely to occur in regions prone to sequencing error, such as the two ends of the genome ( Figure S3 ). Further, we remove variants within the poly-A tail. Filtered variant callset is annotated with snpEff (Cingolani et al., 2012) . Both raw and filtered VCF files are available for download on CoV-Seq (http: //covseq.baidu.com/browse) and the pipeline is open source at https://github.com/boxiangliu/covseq.

We use a custom Python script to generate raw variant calls and remove samples with too many mutations indicative of sequencing error. After merging VCFs, we remove multi-allelic sites and variants with the poly-A tail for a filtered set of variants.(B) The interactive genome visualizer shows ORFs (turquoise) and mutations (red). Users can zoom with the top bar and pan with the bottom bar. Hovering over gene bodies and mutations will trigger pop-up windows for relevant information. (C) The mutation table shows positions, alleles and intersecting ORFs. (D) The ORF table shows predicted gene boundaries and supporting information.",
