It has also been reported in most countries of the world.4\n,\n5 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases death.5 Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the virus,6\n,\n7 which is related to Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV is a serious threat to human health.2\n",
