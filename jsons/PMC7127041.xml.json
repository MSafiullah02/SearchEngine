            "text": "Interferons (IFNs), which are produced in response to viral infections, contribute to host defence by establishing an antiviral state in target cells wherein viral replication is blocked or impaired as a result of the synthesis of a number of enzymes interfering with cellular and viral processes (Staeheli, 1990, Sen, 2001). Type I IFNs are a family of cytokines with pleiotropic activities including inhibition of viral replication and cell proliferation, as well as activation of the immune system (Stark et al., 1998). Their administration has been proposed as an immunomodulatory therapy (Domenech et al., 2011) to treat several viral and immunomediated diseases. Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b4, IFN-\u03c4, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03bd, and IFN-\u03ba, are produced by virus-infected cells and exert nonspecific antiviral activities on adjacent non-infected cells (Krause and Pestka, 2005). They display a general mechanism of action based on their interaction with specific cell-surface receptors and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, thereby encoding direct antiviral effectors or molecules with the potential to positively and negatively regulate IFN signaling and other host responses, including enzymes, signaling proteins, chemokines, antigen-presenting proteins, transcription factors, and apoptotic proteins (Der et al., 1998). Overall, a number of ISGs that act to enhance pathogen detection and innate immune signaling (Schneider et al., 2014), such as ISG15, ISG56, and GTPase Mx1, have been shown to function as antiviral effectors. The Mx1 gene product, which is one of the first described inhibitors of virus entry, is broadly inhibitory and acts prior to genome replication at an early postentry step of the virus life cycle (Schneider et al., 2014). ISG15 demonstrates numerous antiviral functions, including inhibition of virus release, lysis of both viral and host proteins, and immunomodulatory cytokine-like properties in its unconjugated form (Schoggins, 2014). ISG56, which is induced in response to type I IFNs, dsRNAs, and viruses (Terenzi et al., 2006), has been implicated in antiviral actions of IFNs against West Nile virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Wacher et al., 2007).",

            "text": "IFN-\u03c9, which was first discovered by Hauptmann and Swetly (Hauptmann and Swetly, 1985), is a type I IFN secreted by virus-infected leukocytes, that are encoded by multiple IFN- or IFN-like genes present across mammalian groups, including cats, porcine and rabbit (Hauptmann and Swetly, 1985, Roberts et al., 1998, Charlier et al., 1993a, Mege et al., 1991). Like other type I IFNs, IFN-\u03c9 presents species-restricted biological activity in vitro and can bind to the same type I IFN receptor complex as other type I IFNs, thus exerting similar antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects (Adolf, 1995). However, its antigenic structure is distantly related to IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3, as it does not cross react with antibodies against them (Adolf, 1995). Interferon-\u03c9 has been used for antiviral treatment in humans and many other mammalian species (Tiefenthaler et al., 1997, Hagelstein et al., 1998, Gil et al., 2014, Leal et al., 2014, Martin et al., 2002). Although human IFN-\u03c9 (HuIFN-\u03c9) can exert in vivo antitumor effects in several models of human cancer (Horton et al., 1999), Feline IFN-\u03c9 (FeIFN-\u03c9) shows a proven antiviral effect, both in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994, Ohe et al., 2008, Litzlbauer et al., 2014) and in vivo (Gil et al., 2014, Leal et al., 2014, Martin et al., 2002, Horton et al., 1999, Mochizuki et al., 1994, Ohe et al., 2008, Litzlbauer et al., 2014), against canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus, and has been licensed for use in veterinary medicine (Virbagen\u00ae, Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (Domenech et al., 2011). Research on BoIFN-\u03c9 subtypes was not much reported, in 1998, BoIFN-\u03c91 was reported to have biological activation, and can sufficiently prevent luteolysis, without being deleterious to embryonic survival (Rodriguez et al., 1998a); in 2015, BoIFN-\u03c924 has been characterized and can be used as a candidate antiviral therapeutic reagent (Luo et al., 2015). The newfound BoIFN-\u03c93, which presents a potential as a novel antiviral therapeutic agent, exerts antiviral activity against VSV in several mammalian cell lines and a protective effect against bovine virus that including BEV, IBRV and BVDV. In this study, we present a novel type I IFN named BoIFN-\u03c93 on the basis of the location in the bovine genome. BoIFN-\u03c93 demonstrates typical characteristics of type I IFN, exerts antiviral activity in several mammalian cell lines, and displays low cytotoxicity in vitro. Additionally, BoIFN-\u03c93 can induce the transcription of Mx1, ISG15, and ISG56 genes, as well as the expression of Mx1 protein in a time-dependent manner. The current findings will be useful to further study BoIFN-\u03c9 in host's defence against infectious diseases, particularly viral infections, and should facilitate research on the bovine interferon family.",

Virus titers were calculated by determining the dilution giving 50% of wells containing cells that displayed cytopathic effect. Antiviral activity was determined with a standard cytopathic effect assay (Rubinstein et al., 1981) with some modifications (Boue et al., 2000, Bracklein et al., 2006, Rodriguez et al., 1998b, Shao et al., 2015a). Briefly, the monolayers cells were seeded in 96 well plates, then inoculated with four-fold serial diluted BoIFNs. After overnight cultivation, 100 TCID50 viruses was added to each well and the plate was then re-incubated under the conditions of 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 18\u201324 h. Eight wells without the viruses were used as the cell controls, and the other eight wells without BoIFNs were used as the virus controls. One antiviral activity unit (1 U) was defined as a 50% reduction in the virus induced destruction of the cell monolayer. Based on the antiviral activity measured on MDBK cells, 100 U represents 117 ng, 32.2 ng and 168 ng of BoIFN-\u03c93, BoIFN-\u03c924 and BoIFN-\u03b1A respectively.",
