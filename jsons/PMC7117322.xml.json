            "text": "MaHV-1 was first identified by Finnie et al. (1976) in a captive mob of parma wallabies (Macropus parma). The viral infection produced fatal systemic disease resulting in severe clinical signs including pyrexia, respiratory signs, conjunctivitis, and anogenital vesicles (Finnie et al., 1976, Acland, 1981). MaHV-2 was later identified in 1978 in captive grey dorcopsis (Dorcopsis muelleri luctuosa) and quokkas (Setonix brachyurus) (Callinan and Kefford, 1981). This virus also resulted in fatal systemic disease characterized by conjunctivitis and lesions on the oral and anogenital mucous membranes. Latent infection with an unclassified alphaherpesvirus was described in the eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus) (Guliani et al., 1999). Herpesvirus infections have also been reported or suspected in other macropod species including tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) and western grey kangaroos (M. fuliginosus), as well as in two species in the family Potoroidae\u2014brush-tailed rat kangaroos (Bettongia penicillata) and rufous rat kangaroos (Aepyprymnus rufescens) (Dickson et al., 1980, Callinan and Kefford, 1981, Wilks et al., 1981). In addition to these natural infections, transient experimental infections with MaHV-1 have been produced in the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) (Zheng et al., 2004). A serologic survey revealed that 23% of wild marsupials tested and 41% of captive marsupials in Australia tested had circulating serum-neutralizing antibodies to a parma wallaby herpesvirus (Webber and Whalley, 1978). However, it is unknown whether the seropositivity reflects exposure to known macropod herpesviruses, previously undescribed herpesviruses, or cross-reaction with antibodies to other antigens unrelated to herpesvirus exposure.",

Negative serum was used on negative control slides. Slides were rinsed in buffer and incubated with the secondary antibody (LSAB2, Dako) at room temperature for 15 min. Following an additional buffer rinse, streptavidin peroxidase (Dako) was applied.

Nested PCR amplification of a partial sequence of the DNA-dependent-DNA polymerase gene was performed using previously described methods (VanDevanter et al., 1996). Briefly, the first round of amplification utilized forward primers DFA (5\u2032-GAYTTYGCNAGYYTNTAYCC-3\u2032, Y = pyrimidine, N = nucleotide) and ILK (5\u2032-TCCTGGACAAGCAGCARNYSGCNMTNAA-3\u2032, R = purine, M = A or C) and reverse primer PCR amplification utilized forward primer TGV (5\u2032-TGTAACTCGGTGTAYGGNTTYACNGGNGT-3\u2032) and reverse primer IYG (5\u2032-CACAGAGTCCGTRTCNCCRTADAT-3\u2032, D = A, G, or T). The mixtures were amplified with an initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 46 \u00b0C for 60 s, DNA extension at 72 \u00b0C for 60 s, and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. Products were resolved on 1% agarose gels and bands of the expected size were excised and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). To obtain additional sequence, an internal reverse primer was designed (primer RooRev TAGTTCTGCCTCGGAGGGTGACGGT) and used in the second round with DFA. Direct sequencing was performed using the Big-Dye Terminator Kit (PerkinElmer, Branchburg, NJ) and analyzed on ABI 377 automated DNA sequencers at the University of Florida Center for Mammalian Genetics DNA Sequencing Facilities. All products were sequenced in both directions. Primer sequences were edited out prior to further analyses.",

            "text": "Comparative sequence analysis of the herpesviruses of diverse host species should contribute to a further understanding of viral phylogeny and the evolution of this important class of viruses. Previous phylogenetic analyses suggest that many elements in the branching patterns of Herpesviridae are congruent with branching patterns for the corresponding host species (Jackson, 2005, McGeoch et al., 2006). The branching of the alphaherpesviruses from the beta- and gammaherpesviruses has been estimated to have occurred approximately 374\u2013413 million years ago, and the branching of the betaherpesviruses from the gammaherpesviruses approximately 331\u2013351 million years ago (McGeoch and Gatherer, 2005). Within the gammaherpesviruses, the divergence of the Rhadinovirus/Percavirus lineages has been estimated to have occurred 70\u201373 million years ago (McGeoch et al., 2005). Looking at host species, the divergence between marsupials and placental mammals has been estimated to have occurred 193\u2013186 million years ago (van Rheede et al., 2006), which would occur temporally after the estimated beta/gamma split but before Rhadinovirus/Percavirus divergence. This is in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis, and supports coevolution.",

The herpesvirus polymerase is the gene for which the most comparative sequence from other herpesviral species is available. Additionally, when looking at evolutionary relationships of more distantly related organisms, the continued accrual of mutations resulting in homoplasy can diminish the ability to correctly resolve phylogeny, making a rapidly mutating gene a poor choice. Genes for which there is strong negative selection will have fewer nucleotides with a history of multiple changes, making them a better choice for resolving phylogeny over greater distances. Genes that are critical for basic organismal functions and are not under heavy immune selection are often highly conserved. Therefore, viral polymerases are usually good choices for long-range phylogeny (Attoui et al., 2002, Gonzalez et al., 2003, Knopf, 1998).",

While the analysis in this study supports clear divergence of the proposed Macavirus from other genera, the division between Rhadinovirus and Percavirus is not as clear, and the new Rhadinovirus appears to be paraphyletic in this analysis. One possible explanation for the differences in this analysis from previous analyses is the inclusion of MaHV-3 and Afrotherian gammaherpesviruses in this analysis. MaHV-3 clusters with the Rhadinovirus/Percavirus/Macavirus lineages, but does not cluster with any one genus, and may be a distinct lineage. Other possible explanations for the differences seen are the assessment of multiple alignment algorithms and substitution models for optimality in this study. Both nucleotide sequence alignment and amino acid substitution models may have significant effects on results (Morrison and Ellis, 1997, Whelan and Goldman, 2001). Finally, this analysis is of a smaller data set from a single gene which may have resulted in error.",

They are closely related to Eutherian viruses in the genus Simplexvirus, and appear to be an example of host switching rather than coevolution (Mahony et al., 1999, Lee and Smith, 1999). Alphaherpesvirinae are often capable of infecting a wider range of host cells than beta- and gammaherpesviruses (Davison et al., 2005), and this may make a host switch more feasible. MaHV-3 may represent a lineage that has evolved in marsupials, may have arisen very close to the basal branching point of the gammaherpesviruses, and may provide insight into the genetic structure of the ancestral herpesviruses. Further sequence and analysis of this virus is indicated to clarify.",

Although the clinical signs observed in the mob could not be definitively linked to the novel virus, MaHV-3 in the eastern grey kangaroo does not appear to result in the same severity of clinical signs associated with the previously described alphaherpesviruses in marsupials. This is consistent with a longer established host-virus coevolutionary relationship as seen in other herpesviruses, whereas the often-fatal disease seen with MaHV-1 and MaHV-2 may suggest a more recent host switch. Comparison of sequencing data of a PCR product obtained from the virus to sequencing data from other known herpesviruses classifies the novel virus in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. However, the novel virus could not easily be placed into any of the four proposed genera within that subfamily. Being the first gammaherpesvirus found in marsupials, MaHV-3 may provide valuable information into the evolution and subsequent phylogenetic classification of herpesviruses.",
