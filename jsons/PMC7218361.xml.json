Pathological findings from six autopsy specimens revealed severe acute tubular necrosis (ATN) on inspection under a light microscope. Further immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in the kidneys, suggesting direct tubular injury from the virus.11 It is difficult to evaluate the precise incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19. The incidence of AKI in published reports is 2%\u20135%. However, most of them were from severely ill hospitalized patients. Therefore, the risk in patients with mild illness might be much lower. The incidence of AKI in SARS patients with normal kidney function (without underlying CKD) is reported to be 6.7 %; this was mostly due to ATN and occasional rhabdomyolysis.12 Moreover, it may even lead to a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4). These enzymes are highly expressed in the kidneys; they might serve as binding sites for the virus and cause kidney injury. Although the mortality rate is much higher in SARS patients with AKI than those without AKI (92% vs8 %),12 it remains unknown whether AKI leads to increased mortality in patients with COVID-19.6\n,\n9\n",

To date, we have no evidence to support the relationship between hypertension and COVID-19. Hypertension increases with age. The COVID-19 disease is more severe and displays worse outcomes in the elderly population.14\n,\n15 After adjustment of age, the association between COVID-19 and hypertension was non-existent.16 Many coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, enter the cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, the risk and severity of COVID-19 might vary with the level of ACE2 receptor.13 The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are widely used as medications in the treatment of hypertension. As the application of ACEI and ARB leads to an increase in the concentration of ACE2, some doctors question its ability to increase the risk and severity of developing COVID-19 as well.13 Neither clinical data nor basic scientific evidence supports this assumption. Therefore, patients who take ACEI or ARB are not advised to change their therapy.13\n",

If patients with CKD get infected with SARS-CoV-2, their renal tubules are likely to be attacked first. Secondly, patients with CKD are generally the elderly population suffering from multiple comorbidities. They usually have imbalanced ratios of CD4+/CD8+ T cells and decreased activity of natural killer cells. Moreover, some patients with CKD (for whom glomerular disease is the reason for developing CKD), might need to take glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants. This may further lead to impairment of their immune system and create increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Thirdly, there are several small arteries and capillaries in the kidney that may be damaged by the SARS-CoV-2. Further, the entire volume of blood passes through the kidneys several times a day. Hence, the virus and the inflammatory cytokines in the blood flow can damage the kidneys. Lastly, as a severe subgroup of patients with CKD, dialysis patients constitute a more susceptible population. Dialysis patients are recurrently exposed to a possible contaminated environment because their routine treatment usually requires three dialysis sessions per week.5 Considering all the above reasons, patients with CKD are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. The development of COVID-19 may worsen the impaired kidney function and further lead to rapid deterioration of kidney function and even death.",

Touching of eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands should be avoided. People should stay at home and maintain distance from others. Coughing or sneezing into a tissue or a flexed elbow should be practiced. Objects and surfaces that are frequently touched should be cleaned regularly.2.Touching of surfaces used in public places should be avoided. A hand towel or tissue should be used when touching doorknobs, light switches, etc. Close contact with sick people and greeting people with a handshake, hug, or a kiss should be avoided. Shoes should be removed outside the house before entering.3.Medicines should be continued by all patients in prescribed doses and under strict compliance with doctor\u2019s instructions unless advised otherwise by their treating doctors. These include the ACE inhibitors and medications for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and urinary protein. All drugs should be continued, especially glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants. Injection therapy, such as cyclophosphamide injection therapy, can be replaced with oral cyclophosphamide or other immunosuppressants under the guidance of a doctor. Subcutaneous injection of erythropoietin can also be replaced by oral drugs. The doctor should be contacted if feeling sick.4.Unnecessary hospital visits should be avoided because patients with CKD are susceptible to COVID-19 and hospitals are high-risk places with some potentially-infected patients. The maximum possible drugs must be procured in every hospital. The necessary drugs must be procured from a nearby pharmacy during a visit to the community hospital for some routine examination. A face mask must be worn during illness and around people or while visiting a health facility. Attending doctors must be contacted using online consultation tools, such as professional medical websites, e-mail, and social media (Facebook, WeChat, etc).5.Diet Management: Extra attention should be paid to food safety and food hygiene issues. Food intake should be diversified. The daily meals should include cereals, vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, soybeans, etc. The protein intake should be reasonably guaranteed. The daily protein intake of non-dialyzed CKD patients should preferably range from 0.6\u20130.8 g/kg/d; a high-quality protein intake comprising fish, shrimp, lean meat, eggs, beans, etc. should account for 60%\u201370 % of the total food constituents. The intake of salt, potassium, phosphorus, and purines should be strictly limited. Moderate amounts of milk and water should be consumed and carbonated drinks, coffee, and alcohol should be avoided.6.Psychological management: In the crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with CKD are more likely to have negative emotions. Excessive and persistent psychological reactions have serious consequences and may lead to irrational behavior and severe physical conditions. Common psychological problems include nervousness, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, physical symptoms, and stress-related physical diseases. A correct cognition towards this crisis should be established. A healthy regular lifestyle with sufficient work and regular rest should be established. Communication with relatives and friends through social media should be encouraged. An overload of information should be avoided and a happy mood should be maintained. Online psychological counseling should be resorted to, if necessary.\n",

            "text": "In summary, severe COVID-19 infection may damage the kidney and cause ATN, leading to proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated serum creatinine. Neither clinical data nor basic scientific evidence supports the idea that ACEI or ARB can increase the risk and severity of developing COVID-19. Therefore, patients who receive ACEI or ARB should not change their therapy unless advised by their physician. Patients with CKD are highly susceptible to COVID-19. Strict comprehensive protocols should be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among patients and healthcare providers.",
