            "text": "Background In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients, computed tomography (CT) examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a large-scale study. Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. Purpose To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. Material and methods We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. Results We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. Conclusion The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 is the most recent global health emergency with more than 850,000 cases and 41,000 deaths reported in over 180 countries as of March 31, 2020 [1] . Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for patient isolation and prompt clinical interventions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly specific test and the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the variable sensitivity of RT-PCR and its lengthy turnaround time h [2] ) underscore the need for a complementary diagnostic approach [3] [4] [5] [6] . Besides, multiple negative RT-PCR test results may be needed to rule out the disease in patients with a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 [7] . [17] were updated with seven additional studies [5, 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Role of chest CT and its relationship with RT-PCR Computed tomography (CT) imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. RT-PCR is the confirmatory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with high specificity. Numerous studies have endorsed the important role of CT in the management of these patients. However, several scientific societies have recommended against the routine use of CT for the screening of COVID-19 [8, 9] . Some countries have established the use of imaging as their frontline diagnostic test [2, 5, 7] . In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed patients, CT examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a study on 1014 patients [5] . The diagnostic value of this modality has been proven in clinically suspicious cases with inconclusive laboratory test results, as well as asymptomatic individuals with known exposure [3, 10] . In many healthcare settings, such as developing countries, CT imaging may be the only available diagnostic test due to a shortage of diagnostic laboratory kits, while validated COVID-19 laboratory test kits are limited in quantity even in industrialized nations [7, 11] . Need for a uniform lexicon and standardized reporting scheme Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Our systematic review of the CT manifestations of COVID-19 showed a substantial inconsistency in description of imaging findings across the growing number of published studies [17] . We encountered the common use of several ambiguous and non-specific terms, such as fibrous stripes (or striped fibrosis), fibrotic streaks, lung fiber cord focus, vacuolar sign, bronchus distortion, patchy shadows, hazy opacities, patchy opacities, airspace disease, and interstitial disease [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . While cardiothoracic radiologists may be familiar with some of these terms, the present variability in lexicon may be confusing for other radiology sub-specialties and referring healthcare providers. To ensure coherent and consistent communication between the healthcare providers, development of a standardized reporting format and lexicon is essential. It will also be vital for the ongoing clinical research, as well as an efficient organization of imaging data input for infectious disease registries.",

For the purpose of the current proposal, seven studies that were published after our initial search were added, and a total of 37 studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT were included [5, 17, 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. A summary of the most common chest CT findings is reported in Table 1 Glossary of Terms for Thoracic Imaging [27] . Using this approach, we composed a comprehensive lexicon that includes the most pertinent terms and can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical imaging findings in COVID-19 patients (Table 2 ). Using the same data, we propose the COVID-19 imaging reporting and data system (COVID-RADS), which is a grading system for CT findings with five categories ( glass opacity (GGO) is a fairly typical finding that may be present at the very early stages of the disease, while multifocal GGO, GGO with superimposed consolidation, and consolidation predominant pattern may be seen at progression/complicated stage. Linear opacities, crazy paving pattern, and white lung can be observed later in the course of progression/complicated stage. Imaging signs of remission, which may appear after the second week of the disease, include the melted sugar sign and parenchymal fibrotic bands [17, 18, 21, 28] . Some of the typical findings may be observed across different stages of the disease and interval changes in imaging ",

Furthermore, our understanding of the chest imaging features of COVID-19 is rapidly expanding and the current proposal is bound to the level of evidence of the studies that it is derived from, majority of which are case reports and small case series. While standardized reporting systems are intended to promote consistency, radiologists may need to adapt our proposed system based on their local or institutional policies and future guidelines.
