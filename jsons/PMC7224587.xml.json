Indeed, hospitals have reported a decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments with myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents [1, 2]. It is likely that patients are concerned about contracting the virus while attending the hospital and are staying away, as there are reports of delayed presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarctions [3].

Hypertensive patients who develop COVID-19 are more likely to be admitted to hospital than normotensive individuals [6]. The presence of hypertension also seems to be associated with poorer outcomes from COVID-19 [7]. It not clear whether it is hypertension per se that contributes to the increased morbidity, or whether patients with hypertension have more underlying health problems, as data have confirmed that patients with multiple comorbidities are likely to fare worse [8]. We should bear in mind though, that these are retrospective data from patients admitted with COVID-19 and therefore can only suggest association and not causation. Nevertheless, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 virus with ACE2 in the endothelial cell [9] does raise the possibility that endothelial dysfunction, which commonly occurs in hypertension [10], may exacerbate the effect of the virus.",

            "text": "A major problem during a pandemic with a hitherto-unknown organism is early conflicting data that can cause uncertainty and confusion in the management of these patients. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor [9] thereby gaining entry to the cells. Concern was therefore raised at the start of the pandemic that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), medications that are commonly used for hypertension and heart failure, could have a potential deleterious effect [11], as ACE2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system and is up regulated by these drugs in some tissues in a subset of animal models [12, 13]. These initial publications led to a considerable amount of discussion and debate with the counter argument being that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to protect from lung injury in experimental models of coronavirus infections [14]. These agents have also previously been demonstrated to reduce systemic inflammation and could potentially reduce the degree of multi-organ failure seen in severe COVID-19 [15]. It was also considered that uncontrolled blood pressure or heart failure that could ensue as a result of discontinuation of these therapies and could contribute to morbidity in infected patients. Guidance was promptly issued advising that these drugs not be discontinued [16, 17]. Subsequent data have raised the possibility that patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs do indeed have a better outcome, with the crucial caveat that the possibility of unmeasured confounding and bias precludes drawing cause-effect conclusions from the clinical studies available thus far. A recent retrospective study from China comparing outcomes on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension has suggested that in the former all-cause mortality was lower (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19\u20130.92; P = 0.03) [18]. Another retrospective study from China showed that fewer patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs had severe disease as compared with those who were not on these drugs (23.5% and 48%, respectively). The ACE inhibitor/ARB-treated group also had significantly higher CD3+ and CD8+ T cells and a trend towards lower IL-6 levels [19] More recent analyses (preprints), though, have suggested that after adjustment for certain likely confounders, the signal for improved outcomes is no longer as strong as first believed [20]. In the end, the effects of treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs will only be positively identified through RCTs, which are ongoing [21].",
