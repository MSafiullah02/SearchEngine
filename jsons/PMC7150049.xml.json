To solve this problem, Brocal and Sebasti\u00e1n (2015a) have developed a new risk model whose objective is to characterize the NER. Nevertheless, this model has two limitations (Brocal et al., 2017). First, the model does not contemplate the possibility of considering independently the new risks (NR) and increasing risks (IR). Second, this model does not allow monitoring the evolution of NER over time, therefore it is not currently possible to determine, in general, the temporary validity of such risks. In order to solve these problems, Brocal et al. (2017) have developed a theoretical framework for the modeling of the NER that allows its monitoring through the technology lifecycle (TLC), especially in industrial processes.\n",

The adoption of IoT in manufacturing enables the transition of traditional manufacturing systems into modern digitalized ones, generating significant economic opportunities through industries' reshaping (Mourtzis et al., 2016). For example, IoT technologies such as RFID and wireless communications are used for capturing real-time machine status (Zhong et al., 2017b). Industrial IoT devices for manufacturing include sensors/actuators, computers with wireless networks, etc., which have contributed significantly to different aspects of manufacturing such as automation and tracking (He et al., 2017). Trappey el al. (2017) divides the IoT architecture into four layers, as briefly described in Table 2.4\n.",

The methodology used in these reports to identify NERs was based on the Delphi method, using the Likert 5-point scale to classify such risks. For each risk identified, the mean values (MVs) and the standard deviations were calculated. In this way, each risk was classified as \u201crisk strongly agreed as emerging,\u201d \u201crisk agreed as emerging,\u201d \u201cundecided,\u201d \u201cthere is agreement that the risk is not emerging,\u201d or \u201cthere is strong agreement that the risk is not emerging.\u201d",

(2010) state that increased automation involves an increased risk of accidents from human errors, and they usually affect users, but\u2014especially in the case of high-risk industries\u2014have the potential for serious consequences beyond the operator to include fellow workers, the community at large, and the environment. With this increased automation, operator tasks have been reduced from directly controlling the process to monitoring the control systems and controlling them (Chidambaram, 2016). This drop in hands-on knowledge and responsibility can lead to a lack of sufficient understanding of the underlying process, which can in turn lead to an accident due to someone doing something inappropriate or not knowing what to do when something goes wrong (Stacey et al., 2017). New technologies, when introduced poorly, entail the risk of increasing operators' mental workload and also of reducing their degree of control over the task, so that if the measures taken are not appropriate increases the risk of negative health effects such as stress and is likely to result in overreliance on automated safety systems (Flasp\u00f6ler et al., 2010).b.\nPsychosocial and musculoskeletal risks: these risks are intimately related, and can be studied together or independently, depending on prevention targets. From the joint perspective on new and emerging risks, Flasp\u00f6ler et al. (2010) states that in automated processes, psychosocial and musculoskeletal problems are caused by reduced physical activity, more static postures, and higher mental workload (e.g., when monitoring and controlling); less privacy at work (as technology allows closer and more intrusive supervision); and more decision-making problems.\n",

Each theme derives from one obstacle and is described in such a way as to provide clarity and operational significance for managers who have the task of identifying, assessing, evaluating, prioritizing, and managing the early phases of development of an emerging issue. These 11 themes interact considerably, but for conceptual clarity, IRGC (2011) has grouped them according to the relevant dimensions of risk governance within which they fit best. These four dimensions of risk governance (from the broad, foundational level to the more specific) and the 11 themes are shown in Fig. 2.6\nand are summarized in Table 2.14\n.",

In the report on emerging systemic risks developed by the IRGC (2010b), it is indicated that some emerging risks do not prove to be as significant as originally feared, but others may prove to be worse than expected, with a high potential for major losses. In this report it is added that typically, the future consequences of emerging risks cannot be defined in monetary terms, at least not to any satisfactory degree of precision, so the conventional approaches to projecting loss size, relative frequencies, or probability distributions over time or severity of consequences are ineffective. Indeed, it is often difficult to establish causality between the source of the emerging risk and its consequences using conventional technical or scientific data (IRGC, 2010b).",
