            "text": "Vaccines for infectious diseases in dogs including canine distemper, canine parvovirus infection, canine infectious hepatitis, and leptospirosis are widely used in small animal practice. Although canine vaccines play a very important role in prevention of the infectious diseases, various adverse reactions after vaccination have been observed in dogs (Brooks, 1991, Greene, 1998, Roth, 1999, Gaskell et al., 2001). Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis are one of the problematic adverse events after vaccination. Anaphylaxis after vaccination is known to be an immediate-type reaction induced by IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity (Greene, 1998). Clinical signs of type I hypersensitivity in dogs after vaccination include hypotensive shock, dyspnea, facial edema, pruritus, weakness, and diarrhea (Greene, 1998). Anaphylaxis is the most severe reaction after vaccination, and it was reported that post-vaccination anaphylaxis resulted in death in some dogs (Ohmori et al., 2002). Allergic reactions after vaccination are considered as an important practical problem in dogs; however, their immunological mechanism has not been well understood.",

In the subsequent study, many children who developed systemic immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination were shown to have anti-gelatin IgE in their sera (Sakaguchi et al., 1995).

FCS contains a variety of proteins including BSA, fibrinogen, lipoprotein, macroglobulin, and transferrin. Although it was reported that vaccination with rabies vaccine induced the elevation of the serum IgE specific to the vaccine antigens including BSA and bovine fibronectin in some healthy dogs (Hogenesch et al., 2002), at present, there has been no data on the specific protein(s) included in FCS to cause allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs.

In humans, some children who showed allergic reactions after vaccination also manifested immediate-type allergic reactions to food containing gelatin before the vaccination (Sakaguchi et al., 1996). Moreover, in dogs, beef is known to be a predominant food that cause food allergy (Jeffers et al., 1996). From these findings, the dogs that showed allergic reactions after the first vaccination might have been already sensitized to beef allergens. It is unclear when these dogs were sensitized to FCS, gelatin, or casein. In humans, it was reported that a baby developed egg allergy after consumption of large amounts of eggs by the mother during pregnancy and breast-feeding (Reininger et al., 2003). In our study, when the dogs were 2\u20133 months old, they exhibited allergic reactions after the first vaccination. It may be possible that prenatal uptake of beef allergens and/or uptake of beef allergens during breast-feeding contributed to the sensitization of FCS, gelatin, or casein. On the other hand, in other dogs that showed allergic reactions after several vaccinations, it is unclear whether these dogs had been sensitized to FCS, gelatin, or casein by previous vaccination or other routes. Further study will be needed to investigate the relationship between post-vaccination allergic reactions and other allergic diseases, especially food allergy, in dogs.",
