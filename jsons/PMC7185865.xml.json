Due to a lack of complete and real data pertaining from historical outbreaks, the performance of these systems have been previously difficult to evaluate [10]. Adding to these difficulties is the fact that the information obtained from historical outbreaks may be heterogeneous, due to changes in the outbreak surveillance criteria\u2019s over time. In order to compensate for missing or heterogeneous information, semi-synthetic datasets can be created which contain the outbreak signals, using a software tool. By using this tool, the parameters of the outbreak including the desired duration, temporal pattern and the magnitude (based on a predefined criteria), can be specially set.",

The probability function for any given window is proportional to [27], [28]:(6)P(CA)=\u2211z\u2208CAACzdC-\u2211Z\u2208ACzd\u2211d\u2208ACzd-CA\u2211d\u2208acCzdwhere Czd was the observed number of cases in subzone z and during day d. C was the total number of observed cases during the whole study phase T for the whole study region. CA was the observed case count scanned in cylinder A. The generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) was calculated as a measure of the evidence that cylinder A contains an outbreak. Among the many cylinders evaluated, the one with the maximum GLR constitutes the space\u2013time cluster of cases that is least likely to be a chance occurrence and, hence, is the primary candidate for a true outbreak. The size and location of the scanning window is under dynamic change [28]. The maximum temporal cluster size was determined by considering the incubation period of the disease studied. For bacillary dysentery, the average incubation period was 1\u20133 days. Therefore, the maximum temporal cluster size in this study was set as (1d, 3d, 5d and 7d). The maximum spatial cluster size can be determined in virtue of the geographical area or the proportion of the whole population. Since data on the proportion of the population in each sub-district were unavailable, the maximum spatial cluster size in this study was set as (2, 5, 8 and 10 km), referring to the geographical area of each sub-district. The performance was analyzed using P values of 0.05.",

EWMA applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The choice of weighting factor \u03bb is the key for successful outbreak detection. With proper \u03bb value, EWMA control procedure can be adjusted to be sensitive to a small or gradual drift in the process. We feel that adjusting \u03bb value should be an imperative step before applying EWMA into practice. Space\u2013time permutation scan statistics consider both the temporal and spatial factors. The scanning window is under dynamic change to avoid selection bias. However, space\u2013time scan statistics do not consider population movements. In addition, space\u2013time scan statistics can only identify clusters in simple regular shapes. If the cluster does not conform to a regular shape, the algorithm may have a poor performance. Therefore, when space\u2013time permutation scan statistics are used to detect the outbreaks, it is imperative to understand the cluster shape. Only in the right shape, can space\u2013time permutation scan statistics demonstrate a high detection efficacy. Aside from these limitations, the use of space\u2013time permutation scan statistics allowed the early outbreak detection for bacillary dysentery.",

These differences in the time to detection calculations may explain the differences between the two studies. In our study, when the algorithms failed to detect the simulated outbreak, time to detection was set as the largest value (3 days). As we know, C1, C2 and C3 have increasing sensitivities. Obviously, as the sensitivity increased from C1 to C3, the number of missed outbreaks decreased and consequently the time to detection declined accordingly.

We made timeliness the priority over accuracy due to bacillary dysentery\u2019s short incubation period and the fact that it can be both food-borne and water-borne.

It is therefore important to collect extra information on workplaces, schools and other units. Due to a lack of actual outbreaks, we injected simulated outbreaks into the baseline so we could undertake a performance assessment on these outbreak detection algorithms. We changed the size, magnitude, temporal progressive pattern, season and spatial distribution of bacillary dysentery, in order to have a variety of outbreak conditions to test.
