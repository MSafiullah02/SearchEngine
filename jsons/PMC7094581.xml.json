Only canine distemper virus infection seems to be an important cause of death in this species (Origgi et al., 2012). The badger plays a role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in Great Britain, with a high percentage of badgers having TB lesions (Corner et al., 2012). Serological studies have shown that badgers have antibodies against several infectious agents typically associated with dogs, cats or man (Sobrino et al., 2008, Mill\u00e1n et al., 2009, Quinn et al., 2012) and a potential involvement in the epidemiology of several domestic animal and human diseases has been suggested.",

Microscopically, there was severe pyogranulomatous pleuritis and pericarditis (Fig. 1\n). Numerous neutrophils, macrophages, some small giant cells, fibrin and, in some areas, neovascularization were observed (Fig. 2\n). Mesothelial cells were metaplastic showing a rounded morphology (Fig. 2). The lung showed atelectasis, congestion and haemorrhage, with alveoli occupied by numerous macrophages, some of them with foamy cytoplasm and neutrophils. Mild to moderate proliferative catarrhal bronchiolitis was seen (Fig. 3\n). Some airways and blood vessels were surrounded by a slight infiltration of mononuclear cells (Fig. 3). PAS and ZN stains were both negative. The only other significant lesions were found in the spleen, which showed moderate follicular hyperplasia, and in the lymph nodes, in which there was lymphoid depletion in the follicular areas.",

A continuous sequence of 1,432 base pairs (bp) of the 16S rRNA gene was obtained from the isolate (GenBank accession number KF021280).

The isolate clustered with S. halichoeri in both ML and MP phylogenetic trees (Fig. 4\n), with 100% in both trees. Similarly, a 697 bp sequence was obtained for the rpoB gene (Genbank accession number: KF138590). This sequence displayed 99.28% similarity with the corresponding gene of S. halichoeri culture-collection CCUG:48,342 (JN580236.1) and 99.22% with S. halichoeri strain CIP 108195 (DQ232471.1), with the third most similar sequence being that corresponding to S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis AC-2713 (HE858529.1).

Other pathogens such as fungi, Nocardia spp., Actinomyces spp. or coronavirus that can induce similar granulomatous lesions were also ruled out. The only significant microbiological finding was a pure culture of S. halichoeri suggesting an aetiological role for this organism. The identification of S. halichoeri was only achieved after molecular studies. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has become the new \u2018gold standard\u2019 for defining species and genus (Clarridge, 2004). It has been suggested that a minimum of 99% sequence similarity should be present for species identification, with an ideal value >99.5%. Our results met this criterion; however, for some strains from the Streptococcus genus, the rpoB gene has been proposed as an alternative to 16S rRNA (Vos et al., 2012). The high similarity observed between the 697 bp rpoB gene fragment sequenced and this gene in two strains of S. halichoeri, strongly support the results obtained in the 16S rRNA analysis.",

Most species are commensals of the upper respiratory tract and lower urinary tract and may cause opportunistic infections, typically of a suppurative nature. In badgers, the only reference of Streptococcus spp. isolation comes from a study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in which a light growth of alpha and beta-haemolytic streptococci was detected (McCarthy et al., 2009). S. halichoeri was first reported in UK grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) with skin wounds (Lawson et al., 2004) and, very recently, from a man with empyema (Foo and Chan, 2014). The occurrence of S. halichoeri in the European badger and the grey seal, two species with a very different way of life, is an interesting finding. One possible explanation for this could be the lack of accurate information about bacterial species in wild carnivores. Additionally, the recent isolation in a human being raises the possibility of a more widespread distribution of S. halichoeri and that this Streptococcus sp. could be an emerging zoonotic infection (Foo and Chan, 2014). S. halichoeri infection might be underdiagnosed due to difficulties in identification by traditional techniques (Foo and Chan, 2014). In the present case sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene permitted identification of this species, although routine techniques failed in the identification.",

            "text": "The origin of the infection in this case remains unclear. Pleuritis and pyothorax are often associated with pneumonic spread from bacteria aspirated from the oropharyngeal microflora. Other routes include haematogenous spread and, less often, bite wounds and perforation of the oesophagus or reticulum (Caswell and Williams, 2007). In the present case, no external injuries suggesting fighting or accidents during trapping were observed and the origin was suspected to be the aspiration of oropharyngeal flora. Further studies are necessary, however, to confirm if S. halichoeri is a normal inhabitant of the oral mucosa of badgers. On the other hand, respiratory bacterial infections, as often observed with streptococci, are favoured by stress or previous viral infection (Caswell and Williams, 2007). Canine distemper virus is an important respiratory pathogen in dogs and mustelids, often predisposing to secondary bacterial infections (Barron and Rosenthal, 2012). Although canine distemper was not identified, the possibility of co-infection with other viral pathogens cannot be excluded. In the present case, the stress of being trapped and handled may have precipitated the disease.",

Interestingly, the isolation from a man with empyema suggests that this streptococcal species might be associated mainly with suppurative lesions of the respiratory system. It also emphasizes that molecular techniques may be needed for a final identification of some bacterial species and that more studies are needed in wildlife to demonstrate their potential role as reservoirs of both known and unknown pathogens.",
