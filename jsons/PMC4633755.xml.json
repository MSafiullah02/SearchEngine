European trials have been performed in a variety of settings, including emergency departments, primary care offices, hospitals, and ICUs [10, 16, 17, 19\u201325]. In all prior studies, antibiotic use was decreased without harm, as measured by composite adverse event outcomes. The largest trial to date was a Swiss multicenter randomized trial of PCT-guided therapy in 1359 hospitalized patients with LRTI [16]. A 35% decrease in overall antibiotic exposure was reported without notable differences in short-term or long-term outcomes. Currently, use of PCT levels in the United States is only approved for management of sepsis [11, 26]. The only US data on PCT-guided care for patients with LRTI comes from the ProREAL study, an observational surveillance of antibiotic prescribing practices when PCT testing was made available in one US hospital, 10 Swiss centers and 3 French centers [22, 23]. For the 295 patients evaluated in the United States, adherence to the algorithm was 35%, which was significantly lower than the percentage among algorithm-experienced European centers, suggesting that experience increases confidence and compliance with this approach.",

However, despite relatively good compliance and a population enriched for subjects with a low risk for bacterial complications, we did not see significant differences in antibiotic use between the intervention and nonintervention arms. We suspect that this result was in part due to a significant study effect resulting in decreased antibiotic exposure in nonintervention patients. Supporting this conclusion was the overall decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy for nonintervention subjects, compared with the duration for similar historical controls. The study effects were likely multifactorial, including the prestudy educational sessions, spillover care resulting from providers caring for patients in both arms, and increased awareness of viral activity in the community. Last, providers were also aware that their behavior was being observed, which may have resulted in a Hawthorne effect [34].",

However, like the European trials, we did not detect any major safety signals prohibitive to proceeding with larger clinical trials. Second, repeat PCT measurements over several days during hospitalization were not performed and may be of added value to decrease antibiotic use.

Although our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of performing PCT trials in the United States, a number of factors need consideration. First, hospital stays for nonpneumonic LRTI tend to be brief, and thus the opportunity to intervene is limited. To maximize impact on antibiotic exposure, the intervention should begin early, ideally in the emergency department. Second, algorithm adherence needs to improve, although clinical judgment remains the cornerstone of good medical care, and 100% compliance should not be the goal. Future trials should therefore incorporate strategies to influence physician behavior, such as the use of antibiotic stewardship teams to reinforce PCT algorithm recommendations. Because a study effect appeared to be an important impediment to demonstrating a significant difference in antibiotic exposure or the independent effect of viral testing, future trials may need to use separate but comparable study sites for the intervention and nonintervention groups. Finally, once the safety of PCT-guided care in patients with LRTI at lower risk for bacterial infections has been established, its use should also be explored for subjects with pneumonic disease.",
