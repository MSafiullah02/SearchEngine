The disease is characterised by a dry hacking cough with a recovery period of 1\u20133 weeks, but can progress to a severe bronchopneumonia which may be fatal (Appel and Binn, 1987). Many microbiological agents have been associated with CIRD; including Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parainfluenza virus; canine adenovirus-2; canine herpesvirus and Mycoplasma spp. which may act alone or in synergy to cause disease (Binn et al., 1967, Ditchfield et al., 1962, Karpas et al., 1968, Keil and Fenwick, 1998, Randolph et al., 1993). However, despite widespread vaccination against a number of these agents, CIRD has remained a persistent problem (Erles et al., 2004).",

One qPCR method available currently, which may be used for the quantitation of CRCoV, uses highly degenerate primers which enables the detection of coronaviruses from all three coronavirus groups (Escutenaire et al., 2007). As such this assay is unable to distinguish between CRCoV and the other coronavirus which infects dogs, canine coronavirus (CCoV); a group one virus, which causes enteric disease (Binn et al., 1974).",

The assay was performed using a modification of a previously published protocol (Whelan et al., 2003). Briefly the \u03bb DNA standard was diluted in 1\u00d7 Tris\u2013EDTA (TE) in a fivefold dilution series from 1 \u03bcg/ml to 1.6 ng/ml. cDNA samples were diluted 1:50 in 1\u00d7 TE. 50 \u03bcl per well of each standard/cDNA sample was aliquoted in duplicate in a 96 well plate. The PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted 1:200 in 1\u00d7 TE and 50 \u03bcl was added to each well, therefore making a further 1:2 dilution of the standards and samples. The fluorescence was measured using the SPECTRAmax M2 Plate reader (Molecular devices) with an excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm. The linear standard curve was constructed for the \u03bb DNA standard concentration vs. fluorescence units. The concentration of the cDNA was calculated from the linear equation after adjusting for the dilution.",

This assay was shown to have a high degree of sensitivity and performs well over a wide dynamic range. The assay was able to detect 10-fold differences, over 8 logs, of plasmid DNA in concentrations down to less than 10 copies per reaction and less than 1 TCID50 of cell culture grown virus. Furthermore, the presence of cDNA or the use of cDNA as the target did not adversely affect PCR efficiency or sensitivity when compared to plasmid DNA. The high sensitivity combined with its wide dynamic range makes it ideal for detecting high and low level infections.",

CRCoV was also detected in the bronchial lymph node, lung, and mesenteric lymph node. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time qPCR and conventional nested CRCoV PCR results were comparable. However, there were two bronchial lymph node samples which were positive for CRCoV by qPCR but negative by the conventional PCR, and two colon samples which were negative by qPCR but positive by the conventional PCR. This is most likely due to the low copy numbers present in the samples and indicates that both assays may give rise to false negative results. The presence of PCR inhibitors in these samples can be ruled out as GapDH RT-PCR results are positive for all the tissues analysed. Further tests using colon samples will be necessary to further validate the performance of the qPCR with this tissue. Assay specificity for the detection of CRCoV in tissues was high, with no evidence of non-specific amplification observed, except for CRCoV negative spleen and nasal mucosa. Nevertheless false positives generated in these tissues could be easily disregarded through analysis of the melting curve data.",

In addition CRCoV has been detected in a rectal swab from one dog (Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006). In an experimental study carried out using bovine coronavirus two dogs inoculated intra-nasally were found to be positive for BCoV in rectal swabs on days 1 and 5, respectively. Bovine coronavirus causes both respiratory and enteric disease in cattle and CRCoV may exhibit a similar tissue tropism. In the current study the samples were from dogs housed at a facility with a known high prevalence of CRCoV. Due to the collection of samples from dogs with naturally occurring infection, the choice of time points for sampling was limited and the duration of infection was unknown. In order to determine the precise tissue tropism of CRCoV experimental studies will be required.",

This assay therefore will be an invaluable tool for further research and diagnostic purposes. In addition this report shows evidence of CRCoV in a range of canine tissues during infection.
