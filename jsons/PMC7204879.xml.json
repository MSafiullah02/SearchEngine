Since then, more than 30 additional strains were identified. Among them, the prototypic stain HCoV-229E (named after a student specimen coded 229E) was isolated using standard tissue culture. HCoV-OC43 (Organ Culture 43) was later recovered using tracheal organ culture and found to be serologically distinct from HCoV-229E. These two viruses were the focus of HCoV research in the following years, until the emergence of the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u20132003. In the post SARS era, two more HCoVs were identified. HCoV-NL63 (NetherLand 63) was isolated from the aspirate of a 7-month-old infant with bronchiolitis in 2004, whereas HCoV-HKU1 (Hong Kong University 1) was isolated from a Hong Kong patient with pneumonia in 2005. Since then, two more zoonotic HCoVs have emerged, namely as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, a.k.a. SARS-CoV-2). Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that are associated with severe respiratory disease, the four common HCoVs (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) generally cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illness, presumably contributing to 15%\u201330% of cases of common colds in human.",

One recent study has examined the circulation of HCoV in Israel during 2015\u20132016. In the winter influenza survey, 10.36% of patients were infected with the other three common HCoVs; among them, 43.43% were infected with HCoV-OC43, 44.95% with HCoV-NL63, and 11.62% with HCoV-229E. Although it is absent from the winter survey, 22.6% of the hospitalized patients were positive for HCoV-HKU1, mainly during the spring-summer period.",

At the same time, HCoV detection is carried out in a limited number of virological laboratories, because HCoV infections cannot be easily distinguished clinically from other causes of upper respiratory tract infections. The presence of multiple genotypes and the co-infection with other respiratory viruses, such as human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and parainfluenza viruses, render the detection of HCoV even more challanging. HCoVs are also sometimes detected in asymptomatic patients/individuals; so that the presence of these viruses may not be etiologically related to the illness.",

HCoV-229E has sometimes been isolated in human diploid cell lines. However, HCoV-OC43 initially required cell organ culture systems for isolation, although this virus can now be grown in tissue culture cells. HCoV-NL63 can infect monkey kidney LLC-MK2 cells or Vero cells, whereas HCoV-HKU1 has been grown only in primary human airway epithelial cells.

PCR primers can be designed to be broadly reactive or strain specific, based on primer binding sites (usually in the viral replicase and/or the N gene). A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay capable of detecting all four common HCoVs (HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) has become the diagnostic method of choice. A simple and sensitive assay for rapid detection of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has been developed by colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). This method employs six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct regions of the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene for amplification of target sequences under isothermal conditions at 63\u00b0C for 1 h. This RT-LAMP assay can achieve a high sensitivity of 1600 RNA copies per reaction with high specificity, and is suitable for clinical settings without conventional PCR equipment.",

Moreover, when administered intranasally to a mouse model, these inhibitors could widely distribute in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and maintain fusion-inhibitory activity. Some polymers, such as a cationically modified chitosan known as N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride and its derivatives, have been shown to block HCoV-NL63 entry by inhibiting the receptor binding of S protein. Viral entry can also be inhibited using serine proteases (such as camostat) and cysteine protease inhibitor (such as K11777). These compounds inhibit the critical proteolytic activation of HCoV S protein, thereby blocking the entry step of HCoV infection.

A systemic investigation of HCoV-host interactome has identified cyclophilins as targets for pan-coronavirus inhibitors. In fact, knockdown of cyclophilin A (CypA) in Caco-2 cells inhibits the replication of HCoV-NL63, suggesting that CypA is required for virus replication. Notably, when cells are treated with cyclosporinA (CsA) or FK506, potent immunosuppressive drugs that bind to CypA or related immunophilins, the replication of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV is inhibited. Importantly, recent studies also show that CsD Alisporivir, NIM811, and other novel non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CsA and FK506 can also strongly inhibit the growth of HCoV-NL63 in cell culture at low micromolar, non-cytotoxic concentrations. Therefore, non-immunosuppressive CypA inhibitors may be promising candidates as antivirals against HCoV infection. Interestingly, the replication of HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV is also suppressed when exogenous arachidonic acid or linoleic acid is added to the culture medium, suggesting that the regulation of host lipid metabolism could also be a common and druggable target for coronavirus infections.",

Nsps induce the rearrangement of cellular membrane to form DMVs, where the viral RTCs are anchored.
