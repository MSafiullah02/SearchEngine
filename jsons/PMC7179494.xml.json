The virus is believed to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cellular adherence [1]. Typically causing respiratory or gastrointestinal disease, these ACE2 receptor epithelial and endothelial cells have been identified throughout the chest and abdomen [18,19]. Although the expression of ACE2 is low in the brain, autopsy studies have previously demonstrated SARS-CoV particle presence brain tissue [20]. Moreover, neurological deposition has been demonstrated in most other beta-coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-229E, mouse hepatitis virus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (HEV) [6]. Some authors have postulated a mechanism other than ACE2 epithelial or endothelial cell adherence as a route for CNS infiltration such as trans-synaptic viral transfer after initial peripheral nerve invasion [6]. This would then explain findings of some studies demonstrating the virus\u2019 predominant presence in neurons [[20], [21], [22]]. However, the higher relative prevalence of SARS-CoV in the cerebrum (where glial cells are more common) compared to the cerebellum in autopsy studies has led others to postulate a glial presence of ACE2 [17,20].",

Several theories have been postulated including: direct invasion, blood circulation pathway, neuronal pathway, hypoxia injury, immune injury/cytokine storm syndromes, ACE2 receptor expression, among others [8,26]. As previously described, perhaps the leading current theory is direct seeding and trans-synaptic infiltration via the olfactory nerve or perineuronal cells. This route of invasion has been documented in animal studies for other coronaviruses [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. For example, experimental studies in transgenic mice injected intra-nasally with SARS-CoV have demonstrated brain entry via the olfactory nerves with subsequent rapid spread to medial brain structures including the medial temporal lobe, basal ganglia, thalami, and midbrain [30]. These findings would be consistent with the limited case report data available to date.",

Included among these are algorithms pertaining to the deployment of healthcare personnel, and the prioritization, scheduling and cancelling of surgical cases. Algorithms and protocols such as these have been created through interdisciplinary expert panel consensus with the goal of addressing critical neurological and neurosurgical issues and allowing for the safe and continued care of neurological patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viral encephalitis +/- hemorrhagic necrosis involving mesial brain structures such as the mesial temporal lobes and thalami have been reported to date.4Long-term neurodegenerative effects of COVID-19 have yet to be elucidated, but are theorized based on past experience with other beta-coronaviruses.5Neurology and neurosurgical practice patterns are being changed dramatically and constantly updated with publications demonstrating early experiences and recommendations based on facilities and regions most affected.\n",

First, symptoms classified as neurological including headache, dizziness, and altered level of consciousness are non-specific with multiple potential causes. These symptoms may relate to an alternative system of origin, may be therapy related, and/or may be of psychosocial origin. The extent to which these symptoms may impact the practice of neurology and neurosurgery is uncertain. Second, the predominant limitation of this scoping review pertains to limited available early literature. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise dramatically across the world, we anticipate that the literature will also continue to evolve. As the prevalence of COVID-19 increases, more cases reporting rare neurological presentations of COVID-19 are likely to be published. A better understanding of the mechanism and therapeutic options for invasive neurological cases may also evolve. Consensus statements and society guidelines will likely require continual refinement based on emerging COVID-19 specific data. Finally, optimal practice patterns will likely vary widely with nuanced configurations based on regional prevalence and available health care resources. In order to ensure optimum neurological patient management, ongoing study of treatment algorithms will be essential for updating and adapting these approaches as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.",
