Falcipain was first isolated from the trophozoite form of the parasite [1] . The enzyme exhibits maximal activity in an acid medium (pH 5.0 6.5), this being connected with its localization in the digestive vacuoles of trophozoites. The activity of fal cipain is significantly stimulated by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), cysteine, and glutathione. The enzyme cleaves protein substrates: azocoll, gelatin, and casein. Among synthetic substrates, falcipain hydrolyzes those containing in the P1 position Lys or Arg residues, preferring large neutral amino acid residues in the P2 position. Falcipain is inactivated by the peptide inhibitors of cysteine proteinases leupeptin, E 64, and chymostatin [2] .",

It is important to note that the most sig nificant difference between these two species consists in the expression level of cysteine proteinases.

In spite of the fact that the character of inhibition of clostripain is similar to that of trypsin, the binding of inhibitors by clostripain is not analogous to their binding by trypsin [43] .

The catalytic domain is subdivided into subdomains A and B.

Also, caspases and gingipain contain identically situated histidine and cysteine residues, equivalent oxyanion cavities, and S 1 pockets of similar shape and location that determine the substrate specificity of the enzymes.

The molec ular weight of peridontain determined by gel filtration constitutes 75 kD, while SDS PAGE yields two bands corresponding to 55 and 20 kD. Thus, the mature enzyme is a heterodimer with the active site in the large subunit. The pI value of peridontain is 5.3. The enzyme does not hydrolyze azocasein, casein, lysozyme, collagen, fibrin, plasminogen, and fibrinogen. However, when lysozyme was reduced and carboxymethylated, complete cleavage of the protein was observed after less than 10 min. Thus, it can be concluded that peridontain hydrolyses dena tured proteins or easily accessible polypeptide chains, but cannot hydrolyze proteins with pronounced secondary and tertiary structures. Peridontain is active within the range of pH 6.0 9.0, exhibiting maximal activity at pH 7.5 8.0. The enzyme is absolutely inactive in the pres ence of reducing agents such as cysteine, \u03b2 mercap toethanol, and DTT.

In the well studied repre sentative of coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), RDRP encoded inside the genome region (22 kb) results in the translation of a protein precursor of 750 kD [68] . The presence of different functional regions in this polyprotein was predicted.

The amino acid sequence of the first papain like cysteine pro teinase (PCP 1) exhibits a limited similarity with the sequence of papain.

One of the proteins associated with microtubules (MAP 4) is also a substrate of the poliovirus picornain 3C [83] . The cleavage of this protein results in destruction of the cytoskeletal micro tubules of the infected cell. The picornain of FMDV is involved in proteolysis of histone H3 [84] . Thus, picor nain 3C is responsible for many severe cytopathic effects during viral infection.",
