Peptide antibiotics and their derivatives or analogs represent a special group of membrane-active peptides. They act by disrupting the structural integrity of the microbial (bacterial, viral or fungal) membranes. The most important peptides, which showed high or moderate anti-HIV-activity in \u201cin vitro\u201d models include linear peptides: peptide T and DAPTA (Polianova et al., 2003), fuzeon (T-20, enfuvirtide), tifuvirtide (T-1249), cyanovirin-N (CV-N) (Reeves and Piefer, 2005, DeClercq, 2005a, DeClercq, 2005b), ALX 40-4C, the antibiotics polyphemusins and their synthetic analogs (T-22, T-134, T-140) (Rusconi et al., 2004) peptides V1 and enantiomer DV1 and their analogs (Zhou et al., 2002), peptoid CGP 64222 (DeClercq, 2001); and cyclic peptides: antibiotics siamycins I and II, FC131 (synthetic polyphemusin analog), the antibiotics cyclosporins (Tandon and Chhor, 2005) and gramicidins (Bourinbaiar and Jirathitikal, 2003); and polycyclic peptides: antibiotics of the chloropeptin\u2013kistamicin group (Tandon and Chhor, 2005) and the aglycons of glycopeptides of the vancomycin\u2013teicoplanin group (Balzarini et al., 2003, Printsevskaya et al., 2005, DeClercq, 2005b). Several of these peptides (fuzeon, tifuvirtide, cyanovirin-N) demonstrate efficacy in vivo and are currently being used in clinical trials or in preclinical investigations, other peptides are now in development as the potential drugs for cure of AIDS (DeClercq, 2005a, Rusconi et al., 2004, Tandon and Chhor, 2005). Some compounds such as Alx-40-4C, T-1249, T-22 and analogs, CGP64222 are no longer being considered as potential drugs. Some (e.g. Alx-40-4C) were tested in clinic and failed, some (e.g. T-1249) showed activity in clinic but were discontinued for other technical reasons.",

            "text": "A specific group of polycyclic peptide antibiotics-N-acylhexapeptides (chloropeptins, complestatins) and heptapeptides (kistamicins) (shown in the left column in Fig. 1\n) has a common structural motif similar to that of the antibacterial antibiotics of the vancomycin or teicoplanin (ristocetin) groups (shown in the right column, Fig. 1), although the size of their macrocycles, i.e. the framework of these antibiotics, is different. Indeed, the structures of these hexa- or heptapeptide antibiotics and the structures of antibacterial glycopeptide antibiotics and their aglycons show profound differences in amino acid sequence, composition and stereochemistry. The cycle formed with the participation of the amino acids 5\u20137 present in glycopeptide antibiotics, is absent in chloropeptins (1, 2a) and complestatins (1a, 1b) and is of a different type and size in kistamicins (3a, 3b). In this review the numeration of the amino acids in antibiotics of the chloropeptin group starts from the N-terminal amino acid similarly to numeration of amino acids in antibacterial glycopeptide antibiotics. No amino acid, presented in the structures in the left column, is identical with an amino acid incorporated in the peptide core of the antibiotic presented in the right column. Kistamicins (3a, 3b), complestatins (1, 1a, 1b) contain a tryptophan moiety linked to the central amino acid number 4, connected with the amino acid 4 through the atom in the indole position 6 (1, 1a, 1b and 3a, 3b) or 7 (2a, 2b), whereas a substituted phenylalanine moiety is present in the antibacterially active glycopeptides (4\u20138) (Fig. 1). Both groups have a central triheaded triamino-tricarboxy acid 2-4-6, in which aromatic residues are connected through two C\u2014O\u2014C (vancomycin\u2013teicoplanin series) or through C\u2014O\u2014C (4-6) and C\u2014C (2-4) (chloropeptin\u2013kistamycin group) bonds (Hedge et al., 2003). Teicoplanin and relative antibiotics have also a cycle formed by amino acids 1\u20133. Both groups differ in the stereochemistry of the amino acids incorporated: 1R-2R-3S-4R-5R-6S-7S for the vancomycin\u2013teicoplanin group and (1R)-2R-3R-4R-5R-6S-7R for the kistamicin and complestatin group of antibiotics. Complestatin (1a) has R configuration of the C\u2014C bond between amino acids 2 and 4. Besides an S atropoisomer of 1a called isocomplestatin (9) was obtained synthetically (Fig. 2\n) (Shinohara et al., 2005). In the chloropeptin group amino acid 1 is substituted by an acyl group (Deng et al., 2003). Last but not least, the peptides in the left column are not glycosylated. Complestatin (1) rearranges into 2a under acidic conditions (Jayasurriya et al., 1998). 1 and related compounds were isolated from various soil Streptomyces species. Kistamycins were isolated from the fermentation broth of Microtetraspora parvosata subsp. + \nkistnae (Naruse et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Chloropeptins 1 and 2a are equipotent inhibitors of HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein (Kaneko et al., 1989, Seto et al., 1989). 1 inhibited HIV-1 induced cytopathicity and HIV-1 antigen expression in MT-4 cells; the 50% effective doses for these effects were 2.2 and 1.5 \u03bcM, respectively. No toxicity for MT-4 cells was observed at concentrations up to 400 \u03bcM. The agent inhibited the focus formation in HT4-6C cells (CD4-positive HeLa cells); the concentration for 50% focus reduction was 0.9 \u03bcg/mL HIV-1 induced cell fusion in co-cultures of MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4/HTLV-IIIB were also blocked by 1 (the concentration for 50% fusion inhibition was 0.9 \u03bcg/mL). It had no ability to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity. When MT-4 cells were pretreated with 1 for 2 h prior to exposure to HIV-1, the HIV-1 induced cytopathicity was markedly inhibited, while pretreatment of HIV-1 with the agent did not affect the infection. The results obtained in vitro suggest that complestatin (1) primarily interacts with cells and inhibits viral adsorption to the cell surface as well as adsorption of infected cells to adjacent cells (Memota et al., 1999). Compounds 1 and 2a inhibited gp120 to CD4 binding (IC50 1.3 and 2.0 \u03bcM, respectively), the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in MT-4 cells (EC50 1.6 and 1.7 \u03bcM, respectively) and syncytium formation in co-cultured HIV-1 infected and uninfected MOLT-4 cells (IC50 0.5 and 1.1 \u03bcM, respectively). It was demonstrated that 2a was synergistic in the inhibition of the cytopathic effect when combined with other anti-HIV drugs such as zidovudune (AZT), ddI, ddC and nevirapine (Tanaka et al., 1997). 1 inhibited also recombinant feline immunodeficiency virus with an IC50 value of 0.5 \u03bcM and was a more potent inhibitor of recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus, with an IC50 value of 0.1 \u03bcM (Singh et al., 2001). 1 and 2a exhibit no antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and fungi at 1 mg/mL and no cytotoxicity at 20 \u03bcM for B16 melanoma (Matsuzaki et al., 1994). They are also inhibitors of the integrase from several related retroviruses (in vitro). 1 was first discovered as a very strong inhibitor of protease activity of complement in the human complement system\u2014hence is the name \u201ccomplestatin\u201d (Seto et al., 1989). 2a enhances plasminogen binding and fibrinolysis (Endo, 1997). Some other biological properties of these antibiotics were demonstrated (Kim et al., 2004, Hedge et al., 2003, Seo et al., 2001). It supports the previously made conclusion that some peptides are multivalent compounds able to interact with several natural targets (DeClercq, 2001).",

They are classified according to a variation at amino acids 1 and 3. In the vancomycin type, they are aliphatic amino acids d-MeLeu and l-Asn, respectively, in the ristocetin (teicoplanin)-type antibiotics, the amino acids 1 and 3 contain aromatic residues with an ether linkage joining these residues. Several natural glycopeptide antibiotics of this group, such as eremomycin (6), chloroeremomycin (5), ristocetin A (7) (Fig. 1) and others, were not introduced as chemotherapeutic agents but are intensively used in second generation drug design. The rapid increase in the incidence of infections resistant to vancomycin accelerated the search for glycopeptide derivatives active against vancomycin-resistant strains of bacteria. This resulted in discovery of the anti-GRE (glycopeptide resistant enterococci) activity of semisynthetic derivatives of natural glycopeptides containing various hydrophobic moieties. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives depends on the size of the introduced hydrophobic moiety; the optimal size is C9\u2013C14 as linear alkyl type or p-Ar\u2013Bn or the combination of the two types. The most frequently modified positions in the antibiotic molecule are the amino groups of the disaccharide branch, carboxyl group and the resorcinol ring of the amino acid 7 (Preobrazhenskaya and Olsufyeva, 2004).",

The introduction of hydrophobic substituents led to the antibiotic derivatives with marked anti-HIV-1 activities, though some of the compounds were toxic for the cells at rather low drug concentrations (Balzarini et al., 2003). Removing all carbohydrates from vancomycin (4) and eremomycin (6) led to the, respectively, aglycons (11, 12, Fig. 4\n), which were not cytotoxic (IC50\n > 500 \u03bcM), but active against HIV-1 at rather high concentrations (EC50\n \u223c 50\u201365 \u03bcM), whereas it resulted in a significant decrease or loss of antibacterial activity (Printsevskaya et al., 2005). Some of the hydrophobic derivatives of eremomycin aglycon and des- (d-MeLeu)-eremomycin aglycon (11a\u201314a, 15, Fig. 4) (Table 1\n) inhibited both HIV-1 and HIV-2 at comparable extent at EC50 values ranging between 3.0 and 30 \u03bcM.

For example perhydroisoquinolinylamide of teicoplanin aglycon (21, Fig. 5) was active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 with EC50 0.75 and 4.5 \u03bcM, respectively, being not toxic against L-1210, MOLT-4/C8 and CEM cells at concentrations up to 250 \u03bcM. Several teicoplanin aglycon derivatives reached a selectivity index (ratio IC50/EC50) that was \u2265100. Many of the compounds active against HIV-1, were also potent inhibitors of Maloney sarcoma virus-induced transformation of murine fibroblast cell cultures at comparable drug concentrations.",

They are aryl nuclei of amino acids 5 and 7 in chloropeptins and the introduced hydrophobic substituents in semisynthetic glycopeptides. No semisynthetic complestatin derivatives were studied as inhibitors of HIV entry, whereas more than 700 semisynthetic derivatives of vancomycin, eremomycin, teicoplanin and other antibiotics of this class have been synthesized and their antibacterial and antiviral activities were investigated. Deglycosylation of these antibiotics and the degradation of the peptide core led to compounds which have lost antibacterial properties due to the degradation of the binding pocket interacting with bacterial target; however some of them retained anti-HIV activity. The compounds kept their antiviral efficacy against HIV-1 strains that contain mutations in the reverse transcriptase. As these compounds cannot interact with the molecular target of the antibacterial glycopeptides (d-Ala-d-Ala of the bacterial peptidoglycan), their ability to induce resistance to glycopeptides during prolonged administration may be expected to be very low or even absent. Therefore, these novel glycopeptide aglycon derivatives (but not any glycopeptide antibiotic or the derivative with high antibacterial activity) should become promising candidate drugs to be further explored for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of HIV infections. The glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin, eremomycin, etc.) may be used as the starting material for preparation their modified deglycosylated derivatives (aglycons), which possess definite or high anti-HIV activity and simultaneously low toxicity and no antibacterial activity. So they can be envisaged as potential lead compounds for application as microbicides against sexual HIV transmission (Balzarini et al., 2003).",
