Gross total excision was achieved in 57.1%, subtotal excision occurred in 37.5%, and decompression and biopsy were achieved in 5.4% patients. Postoperative vision normalized or improved in 27 patients (86.1%) and was stable in 4 patients (13.9%). Recovery of a preexisting hormonal deficit occurred in 13 (23.2%) patients, and a new hormonal deficit occurred in 9 patients (16.1%). The mean hospital stay was 6.1 AE 4.9 days. Postoperative complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak in 8 patients (14.3%). Four patients (7.1%) had meningitis. Diabetes insipidus was present in 19 patients (33.9%), and postoperative intracranial hematoma requiring evacuation was necessary in 2 patients (3.6%). The mean follow-up duration was 47.5 AE 25.8 months. Lesion progression or recurrence requiring redo surgery occurred in 5 patients (8.9%). Regarding the learning curve, the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, new hormonal deficits, and diabetes insipidus decreased in the second half of the patients.",

            "text": "E ndoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been gaining popularity over the past 2 decades as an atraumatic and a reliable approach for the management of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior cranial fossa lesions. Visual field defects, headaches, ophthalmoplegia, hypopituitarism, and hormone hypersecretion are common presentations of a pituitary adenoma, one of the most common sellar lesions. [1] [2] [3] Microsurgical transsphenoidal approaches had been the gold standard for sellar and suprasellar procedures for decades before the introduction of EES into the neurosurgical field in the mid to late 1990s. 2 The sellar and suprasellar EES technique was a translation from the field of otolaryngology, where it was initially used to replace the previous \"open\" method of sinus surgery. 3 Microscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery had not evolved significantly since its introduction by Harvey Cushing in 1909, until the pioneering work of Hae-Dong Jho in 1997 at the University of Pittsburgh school of medicine. 4 Jho et al 5 demonstrated that endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches were possible for pituitary surgery and could facilitate faster postoperative recovery compared with the gold standard microsurgical approach. EES has continued to gain favorability over conventional microsurgical transsphenoidal approaches for sellar-suprasellar lesions whatever the size and type of the tumor due to the panoramic view of the surgical field, easier mobility of surgical instruments, and better views of anatomic corners with angled lenses. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Endoscopic surgical approaches are associated with a learning curve, and for this reason many neurosurgeons have steered clear of attempting this newer technique. 11 However, current EES research has not focused on the specifics of this learning curve, the clinical and practical implications for a surgeon just beginning to practice EES, or the amount of experience required to become proficient. As well, neurosurgeons in favor of the traditional microscopic approach prefer maintaining stereoscopic vision and direct instrument visualization throughout the procedure. Initially, there were concerns regarding instrument maneuverability in EES; however, technologic advances such as the binarial endoscopic approach have resolved early concerns. 14 Li et al 15 demonstrated that countries such as the United States, with high gross domestic products, tend to contribute more to the field of EES. With this in mind, it is understandable how only large, well-funded academic centers have been able to introduce EES successfully into their neurosurgery programs. 15 There is currently no research showing the adoption and success of EES in small, nonacademic community hospitals, yet a portion of patients with sellar and suprasellar lesions are seen by community neurosurgeons. In Ontario, wait times in 2018 exceeded 26 weeks for neurosurgical patients to access surgery at a university-affiliated health science center. 16, 17 Knowledge regarding the feasibility of EES in smaller community hospitals may help increase access to evidence-based neurosurgical practices for patients with sellar and suprasellar lesions, especially after recent recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic of fair allocation of medical resources among different types of hospitals. 18 The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that EES can be used successfully for the treatment of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions in a community hospital setting, as well as to demonstrate and quantify the steep learning curve associated with EES.",

All patients received intravenous cefazolin 30 minutes before surgery and another single dose 8 hours after surgery, which is similar to previously reported regimens. 20, 21 After the patient was generally anesthetized and endotracheally intubated, the area of the nose was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Next, the otolaryngologist lateralized the middle turbinates bilaterally, followed by harvesting a vascularized unilateral nasoseptal flap. In recurrent cases, the vascularized nasoseptal flap of the contralateral side of the previous approach was harvested. Depending on the location and extent of the tumor, the bony access was expanded from the sphenoid to include transclival and/or transplanum exposure (extended endonasal) as needed. In the olfactory groove meningioma patient, the tumor was accessed through a transethmoid approach. The dura over the tumor was coagulated and opened in a cruciate fashion. The tumor excision/biopsy was carried out according to the pathology of the tumor. After excision/biopsy of the tumor, adequate hemostasis was achieved, followed by reconstruction of the skull base using a simple layer of Surgicel (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA), a layer of Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA); a small layer of fat graft in the sinus, followed by of Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA); and finally a vascularized nasoseptal flap (added only in the second half of patients). In cases of intraoperative high-flow CSF leak and extended approaches, an additional layer of inlay and onlay fascia lata graft were used. Valsalva maneuver was done to confirm no CSF leakage. Medialization of the middle turbinates were done as the final stage of the procedure.",

However, our rate of new deficits postoperatively seems to be in line with that of other researchers, at 16.1%. Rates of new deficits in other studies have ranged from 0% to 20%. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] 35, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] Perioperative complications that we analyzed include the rates of hematoma requiring evacuation, diabetes insipidus, CSF leak, and meningitis. Our patients experienced a similar rate of postoperative hematoma when compared with previous studies described in the literature. In our literature review, the rate of this complication ranged from 0% to 3%. 24, [26] [27] [28] [29] 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43 Two (3. 6%) of our patients experienced this complication and required surgical evacuation of the hematoma. We did have a high rate of permanent diabetes insipidus postoperatively. Six (10.7%) of our patients experienced this complication, whereas the existing literature estimates this complication occurring in 0%e7.7% of cases. 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [40] [41] [42] [43] 50 In terms of the other postoperative complications, our study showed increased rates of postoperative CSF leak and meningitis. Among our patients, 14.3% experienced postoperative CSF leak. In previous studies, the prevalence of postoperative CSF leak ranged from 0%-10.3%. 50, 55 Of these 8 patients, 3 resolved nonoperatively (1 with bed rest only and 2 with a lumbar drain). Five required surgical repair using Surgicel (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA), Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA), fat graft, fascia lata graft, and vascularized nasoseptal flap. Two patients required only 1 repair, 1 patient required 2 repair attempts, and 2 patients required 3 attempts to successfully treat the CSF leak. Out of the 7 patients who were operated on by extended EES, 3 (42.9%) of them developed postoperative CSF leak. This constitutes 37.5% of the patients who developed postoperative CSF leak. However, the CSF leak rate has significantly dropped from 25% to 3.6% (P < 0.05) after using vascularized nasoseptal flaps and proper skull base reconstruction, especially in extended EES cases, and the results were comparable with similar studies. 23, 25, 28, 29, 33, [41] [42] [43] 56, 57 Of our patients, 7.1% experienced meningitis, whereas the prevalence of this in other studies generally ranged from 0%e4.1%. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%, and in the other studies it ranged from 0%e4%. 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [41] [42] [43] Fewer studies have assessed the length of stay after EES; however, our patients' length of stay appears to be on the high end of a range from 3e6 days. 33, 42, 55 Our patients remained in the hospital for 6.1 AE 4.9 days. This may have been due to the relative unfamiliarity of our center with the procedure; the staff therefore may have wanted to observe patients for a longer duration of time. Finally, our recurrence rate was 8.9%, which is within the reported range from 2%e21.4%. 22, 23, 25, 33, 35, 37, 38, 42, 43 Overall, our outcome results and complication rates were relatively higher than those of researchers in academic Table 4 .

However, only the incidence of postoperative CSF leak decreased significantly (7/28 in the first patient group, 1/28 in the second patient group, P < 0.05). This significant decrease is attributed to the use of vascularized nasoseptal flap in the second half of patients. Our small sample size may be the reason that the other complications did not reach statistical significance. However, this is consistent with other studies that have also not shown statistical significance for a decrease in complications. 30, 58, 59 One study has even shown an increase in the complication rate, which was hypothesized to be due to increased surgeon confidence and aggressiveness in attempting GTR as surgeons gained experience with the procedure. 51 Despite this, the decrease in complication rate is certainly clinically significant and reduces the burden on surgeons and patients when reintervention is necessary.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Firstly, this is a retrospective study with an extremely heterogeneous patient population in regard to pathologic diagnosis encompassing a variety of pituitary adenomas, tuberculum sellae and olfactory groove meningiomas, metastasis, craniopharyngioma, Rathke cyst, and a mucocele. The patient population was small with 56 cases, with each of surgeons A, B, C, and D completing 10, 21, 12, and 13 operations, respectively. All of these challenges were overcome. We think that there is a better outcome in terms of patient care when there is interspecialty teamwork among neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, endocrinologists, ophthalmologist/optometrist, and neurointerventionist. One challenge in regards to initiating the EES, especially in a community hospital setting where EES is relatively new, is that neurosurgeons do not have an abundance of previous experience with endoscopic nasal anatomy. Therefore if there were any intraoperative complications regarding nasal anatomy, an otolaryngologist would be called into the operating room without any prior notice. This was going to lead to increased levels of frustration, especially between neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists. The obvious solution was to increase teamwork and collaboration between the specialties. In this regard, 2 neurosurgeons and 2 otolaryngologists attended several cadaveric courses to learn this new technique together. Only 2 of the local otolaryngologists agreed to participate in the EES operations. This presented another challenge. If any of the postoperative patients presented to the emergency department after discharge, none of the uninvolved otolaryngologists would consider seeing these patients. The otolaryngologists had to better intercommunicate so that they were all comfortable seeing patients post EES presenting with purely nasal problems such as epistaxis. The neuronavigation billing code for remuneration also needed to be alternated between the neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists to better develop the working relationship between the specialties. Other challenges that arose included administrative issues, such as a ORIGINAL ARTICLE lack of funding for and a shortage of nasal instrument sets; the logistics of arranging an otolaryngologist and neurosurgeon to be available at the same time; and education of the neurosurgical operating room nursing staff in regards to otolaryngologic procedures. We overcame all these challenges. The future direction is to train more neurosurgeons in EES techniques. Then it will be more feasible to perform these cases in a community hospital setting. In our case series, only 1 surgeon (D) had a previous fellowship training in endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery with better outcomes than other neurosurgeons. We hope that new trainees will be trained and confident in performing these surgeries in community hospitals.",

            "text": "Despite the fact that our overall complications are higher than those in the reported literature, the outcomes of the second half of patients after the surgeons gained experience were similar to those in academic centers. However, complex cases (e.g., anterior cranial fossa lesions and craniopharyngiomas) should be referred to an experienced surgeon, such as a well-trained endoscopic skull base surgeon in the same center or in an academic center. The learning curve for EES is steep and improves greatly and quickly with adequate practice. So, endoscopic endonasal resection of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions is safe, minimally invasive, and efficient in a community hospital setting, provided the presence of a multidisciplinary team such as neurointervention and neuroendocrinology. Extent of resection, visual, and postoperative outcomes after gaining experience are similar to those reported in larger academic centers. In the future, as time will allow for the progression of endoscopy instruments and increased surgeon experience, this approach should become first line for the treatment of sellar and suprasellar lesions in hospitals of all settings (academic centers, community hospitals, and developing country hospitals).
