Clinically, it presents as airflow obstruction that is poorly reversible with bronchodilators, and laboratory findings include greater thickness of the airway wall, subepithelial layer and smooth muscle, and hyperplasia of goblet epithelial cells [1], [2]. These structural changes may also contribute to, or worsen, bronchial hyperresponsivness. AR may partly explain why lung function declines more rapidly in asthmatics than non-asthmatics, but AR is difficult to study without invasive or costly imaging procedures [1], [3]. There are conflicting data on reversibility of AR with corticosteroid treatment [2], [4], [5], with duration and dose of treatment, and duration of disease at the time of starting treatment, impacting on results. Despite a growing consensus that AR is an important component of asthma, and that amelioration of remodelling is an important therapeutic outcome, the molecular basis of this process remains obscure.",

COPD includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive bronchiolitis. While there is much variation in the lung pathology of COPD, typical features are alveolar destruction leading to permanent peripheral airspace enlargement, small airway fibrosis, increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the small airways, reduced lung elasticity, increased mucus production and declining lung function which is poorly reversible with bronchodilators [6], [7], [8], [9]. Contributing factors to this AR include excessive protease activity and free radical damage, followed by induction of growth factors in a presumably aberrant repair process, which may be worsened by polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize cigarette smoke components [6], [10].",

Respiratory viruses were detected in 39% [11], 56% [12] and 64% [13] of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Respiratory viruses were detected in 80\u201385% of school age children with an acute exacerbation of asthma [14]. Amongst adult asthmatics, 76% of patients requiring emergency treatment for acute asthma were infected with a respiratory virus [15]. COPD exacerbations are linked to worsening quality of life [16] and more rapid decline in lung function with more frequent and longer lasting hospital admissions [17]. The typical viruses known to cause exacerbations are rhinoviruses, which cause most common colds, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs). In addition, Hogg [18] has proposed that latent adenovirus infection might also contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. The detection rate and prevalence of specific viruses varies with patient age, time of year, site of sampling, method of detection, influenza vaccination status and that year's predominant influenza strain. In particular, older studies that use culture and/or serology have lower virus detection rates [19] than when PCR is used [11], [12], [13]. While respiratory symptoms are similar during infection with these pathogens, these are distinct viruses with very different replication strategies.",

Increased numbers of mucus-producing goblet cells and increased staining for the mucin MUC5AC were seen at 21 days p.i., which is similar to the profile of acute fatal asthma in humans [25]. The increased airway hyperreactivity and goblet cell hyperplasia were partly reduced by corticosteroids but unchanged in IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice. The authors interpreted these overall findings to mean that a single virus infection can lead to permanent changes in the epithelium and airways, and this chronic phenotype in mice can be genetically segregated from the acute antiviral response [24].",

Some MMPs, such as MMP-7 are constitutively expressed in healthy tissue (generally epithelial surfaces) but most secreted MMPs are only expressed in tissues undergoing angiogenesis, disease, inflammation and repair [21]. In contrast, the mRNAs for the six membrane-type MMPs are constitutively expressed in many normal cells and tissues, including leukocytes, lung and spleen [26]. In older papers, names of MMPs reflect the best studied of its substrates, whereas more recent terminology uses numbers as many MMPs can cleave multiple substrates. For example, gelatinases A and B are, respectively, known as MMP-2 and MMP-9 [21].",
