Another device has been developed, the Mirus (Pall Medical, Dreieich, Germany), and it is the first to administer desflurane using reflection. The Mirus system can also be used for the delivery of sevoflurane and offers automatic target control of the end-tidal anaesthetic concentration [3].",

Sedation was commenced with an ACD-100, with an initial arterial blood gas sample analysis and recording of variables 30 min after arrival. After the collection of these data, the ventilation parameters were changed to 7 ml/kg, in accordance with the aims mentioned above, and a new arterial blood gas test and recording of spirometry values was performed after 60 min. The respiratory circuit was then changed to an ACD-50, with the ventilator settings returned to 5 ml/kg for 30 min while data were gathered. After 90 min, the settings were changed to 7/ml/kg ready for the final data collection at 120 min. After this was done, the feasibility of extubation after 120 min of admission was assessed in accordance with the unit\u2019s standard protocol.

The ACD-100 activated carbon filter is theoretically capable of absorbing 90% of the patient\u2019s exhaled gas [5]. With established infusion models, infusion rates of 10 ml/h are rarely exceeded in clinical practice [6], which implies that the filter size might be excessive. It was thus surmised that the size of the device could be reduced without affecting its performance, thereby improving its operating limitations. These limitations are determined by the need for a minimum tidal volume of 350 ml, because the ACD-100 requires the insertion of an internal volume of 100 ml [7, 8] into the circuit. This restricts its use with paediatric populations and also for acute respiratory distress syndrome with protective ventilation parameters. On the basis of these premises, a \u201cnew\u201d AnaConDa was designed, with an internal volume of 50 ml and minimum tidal volume of 200 ml [9], permitting a significant reduction in the size of the activated carbon filter, while preserving its operational characteristics.",

The aim was to develop a \u201cclinical\u201d index of the reflection capacity of the AnaConDa\u00ae that avoided assumptions made in other theoretical models that use artificial lungs [5, 11]. Such models estimate lost SEV and SEV in the patient in a balanced phase, in other words under steady state conditions. In this way, administration of SEV in the system is equal to the lost SEV exiting through the reflector. Thus, the concept of reflection efficiency is based on the amount of SEV exhaled or lost or re-inspired in the sense of net volume of gas. In this instance, concentrations of gas are measured, as it is not possible to calculate with precision the amount of SEV that is lost, since this is not a balanced phase. Even so, the SRI estimates the reflection capacity under real conditions in a simple manner that is clinically reproducible. Hence, it can be used for making comparisons between various types of apparatus and different volatile anaesthetics.",

Reflective dead space was attenuated by volatile agents [9, 15], but these effects of sevoflurane do not seem sufficient to compensate for the decrease in the total device space in the ACD-50. This pCO2 reduction does not seem to correspond to haemodynamic impairment, as the MAP showed no differences between the groups, although this is not truly an appropriate measure of cardiac output. There were no differences in the oxygenation values between the devices. In terms of the respiratory mechanics study, the devices did not affect plateau pressures. Previous studies have assessed the influence of the ACD-100 on respiratory effort [16] and concluded that introducing a gas (sevoflurane) into the circuit minimizes the influence of the device, with characteristics approximating to those of the humidifier filters commonly employed.",
