Multifocal lesions may occur anywhere in the central nervous system, resulting in clinical signs compatible with virtually any equine neurologic disease.5., 12., 15. Accurate antemortem diagnosis has been enhanced greatly by the recent development of the Western blot and polymerase chain reaction tests (Equine Biodiagnostics, Inc, Lexington, KY) to detect parasite-specific antibodies or parasite DNA in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of affected horses.7., 11. An immunofluorescence test (Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK) based on an antigen extract of Sarcocystis cruzi from cattle also has been used to test equine serum. This technique lacks the sensitivity and specificity of Western blot analysis and cannot differentiate exposure to S. neurona, the causative agent of EPM, from exposure to S. fayeri, a common parasite of equine skeletal muscle.5 Western blot analysis is based on electrophoretic separation of proteins from cultured S. neurona merozoites. Separation of parasite proteins permits evaluation of serum and CSF samples for the presence of antibodies that react with S. neurona-specific proteins.",

Nationally, seroprevalence is estimated to be 30%; however, exposure seems to be at least 10% higher among horses in the Eastern part of the United States. High seroprevalence among clinically normal horses limits the value of serum testing. It is not possible to distinguish between antibody titers resulting from routine exposure and those resulting from active disease. Seroprevalence among horses with neurologic disease, however, has been twice that of the general horse population.10 Serum from horses with confirmed histologic diagnoses of EPM have tested positive in more than 90% of the cases examined.12 A negative serum test does have diagnostic value. Although it does not completely rule out a diagnosis of EPM, the likelihood for that individual is very low.",

It has been found that peracute cases initially may test negative and that long-term cases with permanent CNS damage also may test negative. Apparently, some horses also respond poorly and do not produce detectable amounts of parasite-specific antibody. False-positive results also may occur. The percentage among horses without detectable histopathologic lesions of EPM, however, has been low. Blood contamination of CSF during collection has been the most common reason for false-positive CSF results. Samples that contain obvious blood contamination may be confounded and should be avoided. New samples should be drawn in a few days. Centrifugation and removal of red blood cells does not correct the problem. Serum antibodies will remain in the CSF supernate. Blood-brain barrier compromise also may allow serum antibodies to pass into CSF. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) index/albumin quotient developed by Dr. Frank Andrews (University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN) permits accurate evaluation of blood-brain barrier integrity and provides valuable assistance for interpretation of EPM test results.1\n",

The nucleotide sequence of each primer was selected to match a small piece of the parasite or target DNA to be amplified. If target DNA is present in the sample to be tested, the primers will attach and allow it to be replicated billions of times.

Giardia infection was found in all age groups, but was higher (17%\u201329%) among foals. Infection rates were 5% to 17% in weanlings, 0% to 9% in yearlings, and 2% to 28% in mares (a 28% infection rate was found among nursing mares). Foals on one farm in southern Ohio were tested every 2 weeks from March to October. Shedding of Giardia cysts began at 2 weeks of age and continued for 1 to 16 weeks (mean, 5.2 weeks). Because the prepatent period for Giardia is 1 to 2 weeks, mares were considered the primary source of infection for foals. Cyst excretion peaked by 9 weeks of age and frequently was intermittent. The longest period between shedding was 8 weeks. None of the horses in any age group of the study developed diarrhea.",
