However, animal studies showed that 35 ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection.

Bradykinin has several important cardiovascular effect on fibrinolysis, vasodilatation, but it is also involved in some inflammatory and oxidative stress processes by kinine74 kallikrein activation. Bradykinine plays its potential inflammatory role in different sites and cells: it 75 is responsible for the stimulation of alveolar macrophages to releases monocytic eosinophil and 76 neutrophil activators which in turns, stimulates the release of prostaglandins and some cytokine 77 involved into inflammatory cascade such as IL1 B and IL6. The effect of bradykinine are mediated 78 by B1 and B2 receptors. Recent in vitro study showed that antagonist of B1 and agonist of B2 are 79 capable to directly induce PGE production. Activation of cyclooxygenase modulated by Nf-kB 80 transcription leading to arachidonic acid levels increase, is an alternative inflammatory pathway. [6] 81 Such mechanisms have been demonstrated in bronchial fibroblast and smooth muscle cells in which 82 IL6 production and expression have been reported. The blockade of B2 receptor and specific 83 proteinkinase administration both reduce the inflammatory activity mediated by bradykinin. 84 The bradykinin escapes subsequent to ACEi administration could be theoretically avoided by ARB 85 that do not influence its production because they acts inside AT1 receptor level antagonizing the 86 effect of ACE system in cardiovascular bed. Unfortunately, in theory this is not the case of COVID 87 infection because it has been revealed that virus trade on the receptor ACE2 for entering inside the 88 human cells. By a second messenger S glycoprotein, virus hosts cell receptors ACE that is the 89 fundamental step for virus insertion inside the cell and consequent replication. S glycoropetin 90 includes two subunits with different actions: S1 influence the virus tropism and attachment around 91 external membrane , S2 is responsible for virus cell fusion and effective cell inclusion. After these 92 processes the virus can capable to enter in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to begin its RNA 93 replication. [7] [Figure 1] Conversely ACE-I could increase plasma angiotensin-I that is tissue 94 protective and ARB could blunt Angiotensin 2 activity capable to induce inflammation and acute 95 immune reactivity in the lungs. [8] Given the paucity of information about I)the molecular 96 mechanisms existing between host and pathogen interaction 2) the lacking knowledge of the 97 mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 causes infection and 3) the complexity of RAS ligand and 98 binding protein, it became imperative to understand the effective role of ACE system in viral",
