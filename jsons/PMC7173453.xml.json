Consequently, in June 1976, shortly after the Asilomar Conference (see Chapter 9: Ensuring Safety in Biotechnology), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) brought out the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant Nucleic Acid Molecules (henceforth referred to as \u201cNIH Guidelines\u201d). (The guidelines have undergone several revisions, the most recent one being in April 2016.) The guidelines recognize six classes of experiments based on the risk involved in the research, which require sanction from different regulatory bodies (see Chapter 9: Ensuring Safety in Biotechnology, Box 9.2).",

The document encouraged countries to develop national codes of practice for implementation within their geographic boundaries. The WHO manual has since been revised twice, in 1993 and again in 2004. The third edition incorporates biosecurity concepts in addition to making specific recommendations for biosafety in handling genetically modified organisms.",

            "text": "Adhering to international standards and incorporating biosafety practices in national policies is important not only to protect plant, animal or human life, and health of its citizens, but also in trade in biotech products. Exporting countries need to demonstrate that the measures it applies to its exports achieve the same level of health protection as in the importing countries in order to avoid barriers in trade. Providing oversight to global rules of trade between nations is the mandate of the World Trade Organization. This organization administers the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (see Chapter 13: Relevance of Intellectual Property Rights in Biotechnology). Article 20 of the GATT allows governments to regulate trade to address biosafety of their citizens provided they do not discriminate or use this clause to disguise protectionism. Countries therefore have made efforts to develop guidelines and appropriate legal frameworks for biosafety regulation. Although the developed countries (e.g., the United States) and regions (e.g., European Union) as leaders in the development of modern biotechnology started to develop these frameworks in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the developing nations generally started the development of national biosafety systems more recently. The WHO manual has served as an important resource document and is consequently reflected in national regulatory instruments for ensuring biosafety.\n",

These organisms thus are of moderate risk to the individual and low risk to the community (e.g., bacterial agents\u2014Aeromonas hydrophila, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp.; fungal agents\u2014Penicillium marneffei, Blastomyces dermatitidis; parasitic agents\u2014Ascaris spp., Trypanosoma spp.; viruses\u2014adenoviruses, Coronaviruses, Papilloma viruses)\u2022\nRisk Group 3: Microorganisms that are pathogenic and can cause serious human or animal diseases, but are not contagious or have effective treatment and preventive measures. These organisms pose high risk to the individual, but low risk to the community (e.g., bacterial agents\u2014Brucella spp., Francisella tularensis, Rickettsia spp.; fungal agents\u2014Coccidiodes immitis, Histoplasma spp.; Viruses and prions\u2014Togaviruses, Flaviviruses such as the Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Pox viruses, prions such as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, rhabdovirus)\u2022\nRisk Group 4: Microorganisms that usually cause serious diseases in humans and animals and can be readily transmitted either directly or indirectly from one to the next individual. Effective treatment and preventive measures are usually unavailable. This class of organisms thus poses a high risk to individuals and to the community (e.g., viral agents such as the Lassa virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Herpes virus simiae, Kayasanur Forest disease, Central European encephalitis, and as yet unidentified hemorrhagic fever agents).\n",

Protocols for emergency situations are established.\u2022Biological material to be removed in an intact state are to be sealed in a primary nonbreakable container, enclosed and sealed in a secondary nonbreakable container, and removed from the facility through a disinfectant dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an airlock designed for the purpose.\u2022Any other material to be removed from the facility are to be autoclaved or decontaminated before exiting the maximum containment laboratory.\u2022Personnel enter and exit the facility only through clothing change and shower rooms; shower every time they exit the facility.\u2022Street clothing is removed and kept in an outer changing room.

Access to the facility requires outer and inner change rooms separated by showers for entry and exit of personnel, and double-door autoclave, fumigation chamber or airlock for passage of materials, supplies, and equipment.\u2022Internal surfaces of walls, floors, and ceilings of the facility should be water, acid, and alkali resistant; the facility should be sealable for fumigation, animal and insect proof. Drains in the floor contain traps filled with suitable chemical disinfectant and are connected directly to the liquid-waste decontamination system. Sewer and other ventilation lines contain HEPA filters.\u2022Benchtops have seamless surfaces impervious to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat; construction of the facility should have adequate space for accessibility for cleaning.\u2022Access doors are self-closing and locking.\u2022An individual supply and exhaust air ventilation system that maintains pressure differentials and directional airflow ensures that airflow inwards from areas outside the facility toward areas of highest potential risk within the facility. The supply and exhaust airflow is monitored by manometers to assure inward (or zero) airflow at all times.\u2022Exhaust air from the facility is filtered through HEPA filters before discharge to the outside.\u2022A specially designed suit area may be provided in the facility entry into which is through an airlock fitted with airtight doors. The air pressure within the suit area is maintained greater than that of adjacent areas. Personnel who enter this area shall wear a one-piece positive pressure suit ventilated by life-support system.

The plants include, but are not limited to, mosses, liverworts, macroscopic algae, and vascular plants including terrestrial crops, forest, and ornamental species. Plant-associated microorganisms include those that have a benign or beneficial effect as also those that cause diseases, and include viroids, virusoids, viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, small algae, as well as microbes being modified for association to plants. Plant-associated small animals include arthropods and nematodes, tests on which require the use of plants.

Appendix P-II establishes four levels referred to as BL1-Plants (P), BL2-P, BL3-P, and BL4-P, which specify the use of plant tissue culture rooms, growth chambers within laboratory facilities, or experiments performed on open benches.
