An estimated 20.9 million American adults (representing 9.5% of the population ages 18 and above) suffer from a mood disorder (Kessler et al., 2005). In addition, the risk of attempting suicide is significantly higher in individuals with a diagnosis of a mood disorder (Beautrais et al., 1996, Mann, 2003). Past suicide attempts are the most important predictor of completed suicide (Haukka et al., 2008). Epidemiologically, a highly replicated seasonal peak of suicide in spring (Postolache et al., 2010), with a greater amplitude in individuals with a history of mood disorders, follows or overlaps with seasonal peaks in epidemics of upper respiratory viruses and related immune responses (Nelson et al., 2005). The development of services to prevent suicide hinges on an understanding of the interplay of factors and agents involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders and suicidal behavior.",

Harrison (1958) described a series of 37 cases of post-influenza depression in Kent, England. Influenza has also been reported to be associated with the onset of a manic episode in individuals with no previous history of mental illness (Steinberg et al., 1972, Maurizi, 1985). These case reports notwithstanding, there is still a need to systematically examine the possible relationship between neurotropic respiratory viruses, mood disorders and suicide attempts.",

Coronaviruses may also be capable of replication within the central nervous system of some individuals, as evident by the presence of RNA in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (Arbour et al., 2000, Dessau et al., 2001). The recent development of assays for the measurement of antibodies to prevalent strains of coronaviruses allows for the study of coronavirus exposure and the linkage of this exposure to diseases. Most recently, coronavirus exposure has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases including recent onset of psychosis (Severance et al., 2009).",

Data collection was carried out at one time point and therefore it is not clear whether influenza or coronavirus infection occurred before, after, or during the onset of the depressive episodes. Consequently, the direction of causality cannot be inferred. Second, possible mediators and confounders such as socioeconomic factors, inflammatory markers, and patients' axis II psychopathology were not assessed. For participants with history of mood disorder, the number of depressive episodes, hospitalizations, age of onset, presence of rapid cycling, comorbid bulimia and cyclothymic temperament (Azorin et al., 2009) were not assessed. In addition, the relatively small sample size makes adjustment for all these potential confounders impractical.",

In addition, individuals with identifiable risk factors for suicidal behavior recovering from these viral infections might have to be monitored more closely. The threshold for intervention (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) following the appearance of symptoms of depressive disorder might also be lower for such individuals. The possibility of the use of prophylactic antidepressant medication for a brief time (as in Capuron et al., 2003), or an increase in the standing dose of antidepressants in treated patients at risk might represent a possible logical aim for a future clinical study. Finally, studies designed to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of the association between the viruses and mood disorders could lead to the discovery of new treatment targets and agents.",
