Acute bronchitis accounts for approximately 42% of these visits, about 75% of ambulatory antibacterial prescriptions and about 11% of total antibacterial prescriptions for adults in the US.[18,19] In a British study, using a standard definition for acute lower bronchitis or lower respiratory tract illness, the incidence of lower respiratory tract illness in women aged 16\u201339 years was found to be 64 per 1000 population, almost twice the incidence in men of a similar age group (36 per 1000 population).[15] The clinical burden of community-acquired LRTI and its contribution to antibacterial use is therefore enormous, with CAP requiring hospital admission representing only the tip of the iceberg.[20]",

In some studies, these pathogens have been implicated in 6% or less of patients.[25] On the other hand, in a series of studies performed in Nottingham, UK,[15,16,26,27] using comprehensive microbiological tests in well defined cohorts of patients representing the spectrum of community-acquired LRTI, S. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were identified with similar frequency in non-pneumonic LRTI and pneumonia (figure 1).

Instead, we recommend the adoption of specific behavioral and multifactorial strategies aimed at educating patients regarding the normally self-limiting nature of acute bronchitis.[23] This is not to say that antibacterials are never indicated in the treatment of acute bronchitis.[34] There will be a proportion of patients, about 20%, where the physician is confident that antibacterials are indicated, usually because of the presence of factors such as focal chest signs, older age of patient and coexisting disease and generally how ill the patient appears.[35,36]",

However, this risk has not been substantiated by a recent case-control study involving 184 pregnant women, 128 of whom were exposed to dextromethorphan in the first trimester.[38] There were six (3.2%) major malformations in the study group compared with five (2.7%) in the control group.

Dyspnea, in particular, is common during pregnancy. It is experienced by 50% of women at 19 weeks gestation and up to 76% at 31 weeks.[81] Physiologic dyspnea characteristically begins early in pregnancy and improves or plateaus as term approaches. It does not usually interfere with daily activities and rarely occurs at rest. Clinical experience and a high index of suspicion are therefore crucial in identifying patients with disproportionate dyspnea in whom pneumonia must be considered. Associated cough should arouse clinical suspicion of an underlying cause. Clinical examination may reveal abnormal chest signs. However, a firm diagnosis of pneumonia can be made only with the aid of a chest radiograph. Therefore, given the appropriate clinical scenario, the risk of misdiagnosing pneumonia is greater than the small risk from radiation exposure.[82] The differential diagnosis of alveolar shadowing on a chest x-ray in the context of pregnancy includes noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in preeclampsia and eclampsia, pulmonary edema secondary to tocolytic agents, aspiration pneumonitis and, rarely, choriocarcinoma with pulmonary metastases.[83] Such conditions are rare in the first trimester and an argument could be made for not performing chest x-rays at this stage in a pregnant woman who presents with the clinical features of mild pneumonia and improves satisfactorily with empiric antibacterials.",

Common to all is the fact that these tools were developed mainly in hospitalized nonpregnant adults and there are no data specifically relating to pregnant patients. Yost et al.[66] retrospectively applied the 1993 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines to 119 pregnant women with pneumonia admitted to hospital. Twenty-two (96%) of the 23 women who had a complicated course were correctly identified, based on the presence of any of the following: coexisting illness (including asthma, diabetes, COPD, heart failure, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease or a postsplenectomy state); altered mental status; respiratory rate >30/min; temperature >38.3\u00b0C; white cell count <4000 or >30 000 cells/mm3; arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) <60mm Hg or arterial carbon dioxide tension >50mm Hg; creatinine >1.2 mg/dL or chest radiographic evidence of multilobar involvement or pleural effusion. The ATS guidelines have since been updated and we recommend that where possible, national guidelines are consulted. We favor the use of the severity assessment tool detailed in the 2001 British Thoracic Society CAP management guidelines in view of its simplicity and hence ready applicability (figure 2). Ultimately, clinical judgement exercised at the individual level remains essential.",

CAP (ambulatory)[26] patients showed symptoms of LRTI with focal chest signs; CAP (hospital)[27] patients showed symptoms of LRTI with radiographic confirmation of pneumonic shadowing; LRTi[15] was defined as an acute illness in a previously well patient with cough as the cardinal symptom and at least one other lower respiratory tract symptom and LRTI[16] was defined as the presence of productive cough associated with another symptom or sign of LRTI plus constitutional symptoms and prescription of antibiotics for the illness.",
