Significant progress has been made in the generation of novel plastid transformation vectors and optimized transformation protocols. There are several advantages of plastid genome engineering over conventional nuclear transformation. Some of the advantages include multigene engineering by expression of biosynthetic pathway genes as operons, extremely high-level expression of protein accumulation, lack of transgene silencing, etc. Transgene containment owing to maternal inheritance is another important advantage of plastid genome engineering. Chloroplast genome modification usually results in alteration of several thousand plastid genome copies in a cell. Several therapeutic proteins, edible vaccines, antimicrobial peptides, and industrially important enzymes have been successfully expressed in chloroplasts so far. Here, we critically recapitulate the latest developments in plastid genome engineering. Latest advancements in plastid genome sequencing are briefed. In addition, advancement of extending the toolbox for plastid engineering for selected applications in the area of molecular farming and production of industrially important enzyme is briefed. 80", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The expected global population by 2050 will be approximately 9.1 billion (High-Level Expert Forum, FAO, October 2009 ; http://www.fao.org). To nourish the everincreasing population, food production has to be increased simultaneously. Use of latest techniques in plant genetic engineering could help to increase the production of food crops. A range of different expression platforms have been used for heterologous production of foreign proteins having pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications (Demain and Vaishnav 2009 ). Among different production platforms, plants have been used as highly economical and scalable production systems for the expression of recombinant proteins, enzymes, and valuable metabolites. Plastid transformation technology has attracted strong interest for different applications in plant biology owing to several advantages compared to conventional nuclear transformation (Adem et al. 2017) . The high ploidy number of chloroplast genome and compartmentalization of proteins allow high levels of foreign protein accumulation. Recombinant proteins are reported to accumulate up to several folds in total leaf soluble protein in plastids (Daniell et al. 2009a, b; Oey et al. 2009; Bock 2015) . Plastid genomes are inherited through the maternal parent and thus provide a strong level of biological containment thus avoiding several ethical concerns. Integration of transgene proceeds via homologous recombination and is therefore highly precise and predictable (Verma and Daniell 2007) . Another important feature of plastid transformation is that genetic machinery in chloroplast is devoid of gene silencing and other epigenetic mechanisms that interfere with stable transgene expression (Wani et al. 2010; Bock 2014) . Recent advancement in plastid transformation is reviewed in (Kumar et al. 2017) . In this chapter, we highlight the impact of chloroplast genome engineering on various plant biology applications. Advancement of chloroplast engineering for improving agronomic traits and plastids as platform for production high-value proteins for biofuel production is discussed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 73, "end": 116, "text": "(High-Level Expert Forum, FAO, October 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 511, "end": 536, "text": "(Demain and Vaishnav 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 916, "end": 934, "text": "(Adem et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1205, "text": "(Daniell et al. 2009a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1222, "text": "Oey et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1233, "text": "Bock 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1527, "text": "(Verma and Daniell 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1749, "text": "(Wani et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1760, "text": "Bock 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1842, "text": "(Kumar et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Plant chloroplast genome (plastome) is a short double-stranded circular DNA of ~100-250 kb in size.

In general, plastome includes approximately 130 genes encoding transcripts involved in carbon fixation (photosynthesis), transcription, and translation.

Conventionally, plastome sequencing was based on cloning of plastid DNA fragments to generate DNA libraries followed by long-range PCR. Alternatively a large set of DNA primers were used to amplify and sequence overlapping DNA fragments in plastid genome. With the rapid advancement in nextgeneration sequencing technology, it is becoming increasingly faster and cheaper to sequence and assemble plastomes. Although different sequencing platforms are available, Illumina and PacBio systems are widely used for sequencing of plastid genome and subsequent assembly Lin et al. 2015; Jackman et al. 2016 ).

Similarly, expression of cry1Ac protein through chloroplast transformation in rice resulted in enhanced resistance against common pests of rice skipper and caterpillar (Kim et al. 2009 ). In another study, transformation of Pseudomonas pyrrocinia chloroperoxidase when expressed in tobacco plastids not only resulted in accumulation of recombinant protein but also improved resistance toward Alternaria Alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium sp., and Verticillium sp.

Expression of \u03b3-tocopherol methyltransferase (\u03b3-TMT) and tocopherol cyclase (TC) in tobacco and lettuce plastids resulted in improved \u03b1-tocopherol levels (Yabuta et al. 2013) .

In addition, recent availability of plastid genome sequence of many plants resulted in broadening the host range just from tobacco and lettuce to other crops like tomato, carrot, potato, cotton, soybean, etc. Despite the several advancements made in plastid transformation, there are still several major concerns that need to be addressed. One of the main disadvantages of plastome engineering is related to post-translational modification. Plastids lack the necessary machinery to glycosylate proteins, and absence of glycosylation is one of the major bottlenecks for the proper folding and functioning of glycoproteins like antibodies. Another major concern is stability of recombinant proteins in plastids. Chloroplast stroma contains several proteases that could degrade recombinant proteins produced. The expression of transgenes in non-green plastids is not as efficient as in green plastids (chloroplasts), and challenges related to poor gene expression in non-green plastid are still a major concern. Although the last two decades witnessed expression of a large number of vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins in plastids (Table 4 .2), hardly any chloroplast-made proteins completed clinical trials. This is due to the strict regulatory and IP issues related to the use of plant-made proteins for human consumption. Nevertheless, addressing some of the above concerns could lead to a new paradigm in plastome engineering and could contribute for the development of sustainable production of therapeutic proteins and industrial enzyme in plastids for human consumption and commercial exploitation, respectively.

About 5000 new infections are being reported every day. Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes one of the most deadly infectious diseases, attempts to develop an effective vaccine remain unsuccessful till date. C4V3 is a protein known to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses during HIV infection. Rubio-Infante et al. (2012) expressed a synthetic gene encoding a C4V3 in tobacco plastids. The authors demonstrated that plant-derived C4V3 elicited both systemic and mucosal antibody responses in BALB/c mice. Further, CD4+ T cell proliferation responses were also reported. The authors strongly proposed plant chloroplasts as biofactories to produce HIV candidate vaccines. Human transforming growth factor-\u03b23 (TGF\u03b23) has high therapeutic value and is used to reduce scarring during wound healing. A synthetic gene with codons optimized for plastid expression resulted in accumulation of the 13-kDa TGF\u03b23 polypeptide by 75-fold in tobacco (Gisby et al. 2011).
