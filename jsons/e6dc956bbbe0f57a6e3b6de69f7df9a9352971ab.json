Procedure indication was grouped into 3 categories: emergent/urgent (procedure that should be performed within 24 hours), semi-urgent (procedures that should be performed between 24 hours and 7 weeks), and elective (procedures that could be performed within 8 or more weeks). The classification of procedures was adapted from a survey of gastroenterologists who had to cancel procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic (Supplement , Table S1 ). 2 During the week of March 23, 2020 to March 29, 2020, our institution started a policy to cancel all semi-urgent and elective procedures. On March 24, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus became available in-house, and testing was performed systematically. We performed a second review of procedures performed between March 30, 2020 and April 5, 2020. During this week all patients were tested within 48 hours before their planned endoscopic procedure.
