Necrosis is a passive (or accidental) cell death due to depletion of cellular resources and is characterized by increased ion permeability of the plasma membrane, cellular swelling and osmotic lysis followed by extensive tissue damage and an intense inflammatory response (Schwartz et al., 1993). On the other hand, apoptosis is described as an active (or programmed) cell death which is a cellular mechanism for suicide. Cells undergoing apoptosis show highly characteristic morphological changes, including shrinkage, blebbing of the plasma membrane, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (Connolly et al., 2000). DNA fragments are enclosed by apoptotic bodies, which are recognized and removed by phagocytes without provoking an inflammatory response. Biochemically, apoptotic cells are characterized by disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, externalization of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, selective proteolysis of a subset of cellular proteins, and cleavage of chromosomal DNA into internucleosomal fragments.",

            "text": "Apoptosis can be induced by two major pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, both of which are regulated by caspases. Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, exist as inactive proenzymes and are activated after cleavage at specific aspartate residues upon apoptotic signals. Cleaved caspases activate other caspases by proteolysis (Kidd, 1998). The extrinsic pathway is mediated by activation of caspase-8 that is initiated mainly by binding of death receptors to their ligands. Internal signals such as DNA damage, radiation, growth factor deprivation, viral infection, and chemotherapeutic agents trigger the intrinsic pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Subsequently, cytochrome c binds to the adaptor molecule Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor-1) causing autocleavage of caspase-9 (Chu et al., 2001). These two pathways converge at the activation of executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7), which are responsible for the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis (Budihardjo et al., 1999). The main targets of these caspases include DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). A crosstalk exists between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Activated caspase-8 mediates the cleavage of Bid to truncated Bid (tBid), an active form. tBid translocates to mitochondria and activates the intrinsic pathway via the release of cytochrome c (Li et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Apoptosis plays an essential role in development and maintenance of homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Moreover, apoptosis also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of several viral infections (Rudin and Thompson, 1997). Apoptosis is often considered as an innate defense mechanism that limits virus infection by elimination of infected cells (Everett and McFadden, 1999). Therefore, many viruses inhibit apoptosis to prevent premature cell death and thus increase progeny viral production. However, some viruses induce apoptosis to enhance progeny viral transmission and avoid the immune response (Thomson, 2001). Many studies have demonstrated that PRRSV induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (Choi and Chae, 2002, Kim et al., 2002, Labarque et al., 2003, Miller and Fox, 2004, Sirinarumitr et al., 1998, Suarez et al., 1996, Sur et al., 1997, Sur et al., 1998). PRRSV infection of both MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) resulted in apoptosis characterized by morphological changes and DNA fragmentation. However, it is controversial whether PRRSV induces apoptosis directly (in infected cells) or indirectly (in bystander cells). There is evidence of direct induction of apoptosis by PRRSV. For example, GP5 (ORF5) of PRRSV has been shown to be an apoptosis inducer (Gagnon et al., 2003, Suarez et al., 1996). However, cells stably expressing GP5 did not show any characteristics of apoptosis (Lee et al., 2004). A nontypical apoptosis was characterized by double staining of DNA fragmentation and PRRSV N protein in unattached dead cells (Kim et al., 2002). However, other studies have shown that PRRSV induces apoptosis mostly in uninfected bystander cells both in vitro and in vivo. In previous studies, the majority of apoptotic cells in lung lavages, lungs, and lymphoid tissues were not positive for PRRSV infection (Choi and Chae, 2002, Kim et al., 2002, Labarque et al., 2003, Miller and Fox, 2004, Sirinarumitr et al., 1998, Suarez et al., 1996, Sur et al., 1997, Sur et al., 1998). Chang et al. reported that alveolar macrophages from PRRSV-infected pigs showed a significantly increased apoptotic rate (22\u201334%) compared to porcine circovirus 2 infected alveolar macrophages (3%) (Chang et al., 2005). Given the fact that only 5\u201310% of alveolar macrophages were PRRSV-infected, these authors suggested that TNF-\u03b1 or GP5 released from PRRSV-infected cells caused apoptosis in bystander cells. Another study from the same group demonstrated that increased FasL expression in PRRSV-infected macrophages caused apoptosis in co-cultured swine splenic lymphocytes (Chang et al., 2007). Based on these results, the majority of apoptotic cells could be non-infected bystander cells although PRRSV induces apoptosis in virus-infected macrophages and dendritic cells. To conclusively prove this, further comprehensive studies which investigate early apoptotic processes are required. Most of the previous studies measured DNA fragmentation by a TUNEL assay, a technique that cannot detect early biochemical changes in apoptotic cell and also cannot differentiate late apoptosis versus necrosis. In the present study we provide further evidence of apoptosis induced by PRRSV directly in PRRSV-infected cells. In addition the pathway through which PRRSV infection induces apoptosis in a continuous cell line is demonstrated.",

Corresponding morphological changes in the cells are shown in Fig. 1C. Typical PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by cellular rounding and clumping was visible at 48 and 60 h p.i. The percentage of PRRSV-infected cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis of nucleocapsid protein expression (Fig. 1D). The majority of cells (over 80%) were positive for viral protein at 48 and 60 h p.i., time points which showed a characteristic CPE in PRRSV-infected cells.",

Annexin V has a high affinity for the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) which is translocated from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet during the early stages of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 2A, PRRSV-infected cells show very little staining above that of the uninfected control cells at 24 h p.i. However, at 48 and 60 h p.i., the median expression of green fluorescence was 13.31% in control cells and 31.34% in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating the extensive staining for annexin V in virus-infected cells. DNA fragmentation, which detects a late apoptotic process, was also determined. The amount of DNA fragmentation in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected cells was not different from mock-infected cells at 24 h p.i. but significantly increased at 48 h and 60 h p.i. as PRRSV replication progressed (Fig. 2B). In addition to biochemical changes, nuclear morphological change was studied by staining with propidium iodide, a fluorescent DNA intercalator. Infection with PRRSV caused distinct changes in nuclear morphology such as chromatin condensation and nuclear segments in apoptotic bodies as shown in Fig. 2C. Collectively, PRRSV-infected cells displayed characteristics of apoptosis such as annexin V staining, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic bodies.",

Therefore, to further confirm that PRRSV induces apoptosis and to characterize the apoptotic pathways activated by PRRSV, total caspase activity was first determined. MARC-145 cells were uninfected or infected with PRRSV for 24, 48, or 60 h and attached cells as well as non-attached cells were harvested. Activated caspases were labeled by FITC-conjugated z-VAD-FMK irreversibly and were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3\n). Following PRRSV infection, cells with activated caspases represented 11.1%, 30.57%, and 43.23% of the total cell population at 24, 48, and 60 h p.i., respectively, while control cells stained for activated caspases ranged from 6.7% to 9.2% (Figs. 3A\u2013C). To differentiate the two apoptotic pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic, it was determined which initiator caspase (caspase-8 or caspase-9) was activated in PRRSV-infected cells. Caspase activity was measured using a colorimetric method that detects hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate IETD-pNA for caspase-8 and LEHD-pNA for caspase-9. Following PRRSV infection, caspase-8 activity started to increase at 48 h p.i., and the activity was more than two-fold higher compared to control cells at 60 h p.i. (Fig. 3D). A similar pattern was seen in caspase-9 activity. The initial caspase-9 activation at 48 h p.i. was followed by a significant increase at 60 h p.i. (Fig. 3E). Signal cascades activated by these two caspases converge on caspase-3 which is one of executioner caspases. Therefore, caspase-3 activity was also measured using a specific substrate, DEVD-pNA. As shown in Fig. 3F, this caspase was also activated by PRRSV infection. The level of caspase-3 activity was about 2.5-fold and 4.0-fold higher at 48 and 60 h p.i., respectively, compared to uninfected control cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PRRSV triggers caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation.",

            "text": "PARP is a substrate for activated caspase-3 and cleaved PARP is considered a hallmark of apoptosis. To provide additional evidence of caspase activation and apoptosis induced by PRRSV, PARP cleavage was monitored during PRRSV infection. As shown in Fig. 4A, PRRSV infection significantly increased levels of cleaved PARP at 48 h p.i., and this level was further increased at 60 h p.i. The pattern of cleaved PARP appearance was similar to that of caspase activation. In uninfected control cells, the amount of cleaved PARP remained relatively stable at low levels. Further experiments using z-VAD-FMK, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, determined that PARP cleavage was caspase-dependent. When PRRSV-infected cells were treated with z-VAD-FMK at different concentrations, the amount of cleaved PARP was significantly reduced in dose-dependent manner and cleaved product was not detectable following treatment with 100 and 200 \u03bcM concentrations (Fig. 4A). To determine the involvement of the two apoptotic pathways in PARP cleavage, caspase-8 and caspase-9 were inhibited with the cell permeable, irreversible, specific caspase inhibitors z-IETD-FMK and z-LEHD-FMK, respectively. When cells infected with PRRSV were treated with caspase inhibitor at 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcM, both caspase inhibitors significantly decreased PRRSV-induced PARP cleavage. At the highest concentrations of z-IETD-FMK and z-LEHD-FMK, cleaved PARP was undetectable in PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 4A). These findings indicate that, in MARC-145 cells, PRRSV may induce apoptosis through both caspase-8 and caspase-9 dependent pathways. The implication is that the death-receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway are both activated and there is significant crosstalk between the two pathways, which means that tBid transmits signals from the extrinsic (caspase-8) to the intrinsic pathway (caspase-9) in PRRSV-induced apoptosis (Roy and Nicholson, 2000).",

The observation that caspase-8 is activated in PRRSV-infected cells led us to test the involvement of the TNF receptor superfamily. For that purpose, cell surface expression of TNFR1, Trail, and FasL was determined by IFA at 60 h PI. Results are shown in Fig. 5\n. Enhanced expression of TNFR1 and FasL was evident on the cell surface of PRRSV-infected cells. In this experiment, cells were not co-stained with anti-PRRSV antibody because antibodies available for anti-PRRSV staining require permeabilization for intracellular staining. At 60 h PI, about 94% of cells stained for nucleocapsid protein of PRRSV (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we concluded that most of cells with upregulated TNFR1 or FasL are PRRSV-infected cells. When MARC-145 cells are infected with PRRSV, typical CPE includes cellular rounding and clumping which are likely responsible for clusters or foci of TNFR1 or FasL positive cells for PRRSV-infected image shown in Fig. 5. However, the expression of Trail was not increased in infected cells or more likely decreased in some cells in this population. Therefore, these findings suggest that PRRSV upregulates the cell surface expression of TNFR1 and FasL, but not Trail, implying a possible role of these molecules in apoptosis of PRRSV-infected cells.",

Following z-IETD-FMK treatment at 20 \u03bcM, the level of caspase-9 activity in PRRSV-infected cells declined to the level of uninfected control cells (Fig. 6A). Next it was determined if Bid was cleaved upon PRRSV infection. Western blot analysis revealed that tBid was not detected in uninfected cells but that PRRSV infection resulted in cleavage of the full-length 22 kDa Bid to 15 kDa tBid at 48 and 60 h p.i., possibly by activated caspase-8 (Fig. 6B). These results imply that the apoptosis signal cascade from the TNF receptor superfamily is transmitted to caspase-8 which in turn cleaves Bid.

In mock-infected control cells, bright staining of Bcl-2 was detected but Bax was undetectable.

Thus, the role of ROS in PRRSV-induced apoptosis was studied. The production of ROS was suppressed by three different antioxidants, PDTC, NAC and rotenone (RTN), at various concentrations. Importantly, the three antioxidants used in these experiments did not show cytotoxicity at all concentrations used. The level of apoptosis was evaluated by immunoblotting of cleaved PARP and measuring DNA fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 9A, all antioxidants prevented the cleavage of PARP in PRRSV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cleaved PARP nearly disappeared at the highest concentration of PDTC and NAC and was hardly detectable in cells treated with RTN at all concentrations tested. Fig. 9B shows that antioxidant treatment after PRRSV infection significantly affected apoptosis induction by PRRSV. All three antioxidants suppressed DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably 150 \u03bcM PDTC or 20 ng/ml RTN reduced the level of DNA fragmentation in PRRSV-infected cells to that of mock-infected cells. The results presented here suggested that apoptosis caused by PRRSV may involve oxidative stress induced by ROS production.",

They evaluated necrosis by measuring DNA fragments released from cells to cell culture medium. We determined if PRRSV-infected cells show necrotic characteristics as well as apoptosis. Cell culture supernatants from the same experiments analyzed for DNA fragmentation (see above) were used for necrosis detection. At 48 and 60 h p.i., a clear increase in DNA fragmentation in cell culture medium was detected in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating the presence of necrosis (Fig. 10A). Recently a specific necrosis factor has been identified. High mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein is a chromatin-binding factor. When cellular membrane integrity is lost due to necrosis, HMGB1 translocates from nucleus to cytoplasm and then is rapidly released in to the extracellular space, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage (Andersson and Tracey, 2004, Bustin, 2002, Rovere-Querini et al., 2004). Therefore, to provide additional evidence for necrosis in PRRSV-infected cells, the level of this protein was monitored by immunoblotting. Fig. 10B shows that the level of HMGB1 in cytoplasm is slightly higher in PRRSV-infected cells than in corresponding control cells at 48 and 60 h p.i, implying that HMGB1 is released from cells. The release of HMGB1 from cells was further studied using flow cytometry analysis. When fixed and permeabilized cells were stained for HMGB1, a decrease in the fluorescence signal was found in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating that cell-associated HMGB1 is lost due to the release of HMGB1 from necrotic cells (Fig. 10C). The effect of caspase inhibitor on necrosis was studied to determine if PRRSV-induced necrosis was secondary to apoptosis (Fig. 10D). With z-VAD-FMK treatment, the amount of DNA fragments released from PRRSV-infected cells was reduced from 1.57 to 1.06 at 100 \u03bcM and to 0.80 fold at 200 \u03bcM, compared to mock-infected cells, indicating that the release of DNA fragments from cells could be a secondary effect to apoptosis. These findings indicate that PRRSV may cause both forms of cell death, apoptosis and necrosis, in MARC-145 cells.",

These studies have characterized apoptosis mainly by morphological changes and DNA fragmentation analysis. In the present study, biochemical characteristics as well as morphological changes have been investigated to elucidate possible mechanisms involved in apoptosis of PRRSV-infected cells. We have shown that PRRSV-infected cells have characteristics of early and late apoptosis, namely PS exposure and chromatin condensation with DNA fragmentation, respectively. In addition, total caspase activity was significantly increased in PRRSV-infected cells and cleavage of a major caspase substrate, PARP, provided additional evidence for caspase activation. Many viruses trigger the activation of the caspase cascades, which in turn are responsible for apoptosis induction in virus-infected cells. To investigate the contribution of caspases to PRRSV-induced apoptosis, cells infected with PRRSV were treated with a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor. This caspase inhibitor significantly suppressed PARP cleavage as well as DNA fragmentation, suggesting that PRRSV-induced apoptosis is also a caspase-mediated process as seen in other viruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus and infectious bronchitis virus (Bartz and Emerman, 1999, Carthy et al., 1998, Devireddy and Jones, 1999, Eleouet et al., 1998, Galvan et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2001, Nava et al., 1998).",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that viruses also use either extrinsic or intrinsic pathways, or both, to induce apoptosis. Viruses such as HIV, Lyssavirus, Tula hantavirus, sendai virus, and influenza virus induce apoptosis via caspase-8 mediated extrinsic pathway (Bartz and Emerman, 1999, Bitzer et al., 1999, Kassis et al., 2004, Li et al., 2004, Zhirnov et al., 2002). Intrinsic pathway activity via caspase-9 activation mediates apoptosis in VSV, rhinovirus, and parvovirus B19 (Deszcz et al., 2005, Gadaleta et al., 2005, Poole et al., 2004). In PRRSV infection, both caspases were activated. Caspase-8 and -9 could be activated independently or caspase-9 activation could be the result of caspase-8 activation. The potential crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways was proven by the dependency of caspase-9 activation on caspase-8 activity and the cleavage of Bid in PRRSV-infected cells. Similar results have been demonstrated for BVDV and hepatitis C virus (Chou et al., 2005, St-Louis et al., 2005).",

Following PRRSV infection, TNFR1 and FasL expression on the cell surface was notably increased while Trail expression was slightly changed. This finding indicates that caspase-8 activation in PRRSV-infected cells could be mediated by ligation of TNFR1 and TNF-\u03b1, and Fas and FasL. Increased FasL expression was also detected on PRRSV-infected macrophages and caused apoptosis in co-cultured swine splenic lymphocytes (Chang et al., 2007).

In normal cells, apoptosis is inhibited by Bcl-2 which inactivates Bax by interacting and forming heterodimers. Pro-apoptotic signals induce translocation of Bax specifically to the mitochondria and Bax together with Bak form membrane-integrated homo-oligomers, which permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane and trigger a loss of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8\nm) followed by the release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Therefore, the Bcl-2 family proteins have been considered as pivotal players in apoptosis, especially mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Not surprisingly, viruses target these proteins to induce or inhibit apoptosis. Our study showed that PRRSV infection down-regulated Bcl-2 but upregulated Bax expression. Activation of Bax could be the result of cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 which generates tBid. Then tBid induces oligomerization of BAK and BAX, thereby inducing release of cytochrome c (Wei et al., 2001). Upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio is also a mechanism by which SARS coronavirus and Bovine herpesvirus (VP22 protein) induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (Qiu et al., 2005, Ren et al., 2005). Over-expression of Bcl-2 has been shown to inhibit the intrinsic apoptosis pathway mediated by mitochondria. However, previous studies demonstrated that apoptosis induced by a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing GP5 of PRRSV was not prevented by Bcl-2 expression (Suarez et al., 1996). Despite this result, it is not clear whether PRRSV-induced apoptosis is independent of Bcl-2 expression because this previous study did not determine the effect of Bcl-2 over-expression on apoptosis induced by PRRSV infection and a PRRSV-nonpermissive N2A neuroblastoma cell line was used.",

As expected from caspase-9 activation and increased Bax expression, PRRSV infection significantly disrupted mitochondria transmembrane potential and resulted in release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. The released cytochrome c forms an apoptosome consisting of Apaf-1 oligomers and adenine nucleotides (ATP) (Budihardjo et al., 1999, Chu et al., 2001). This apoptosome recruits caspase-9 to the complex and activates caspase-9 which in turn activates the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. Some viral proteins are known to be localized to mitochondria and induce apoptosis by altering mitochondrial function (Ciminale et al., 1999, Jacotot et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2002, Nudson et al., 2003). It is not known whether PRRSV encodes a protein which directly targets mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis.",

Therefore, the role of apoptosis in PRRSV progeny release was studied here. Although PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation in PRRSV-infected cells were blocked, comparable amounts of infectious virus were released from caspase-inhibitor-treated cells. These findings suggested that apoptosis is not required for the replication of PRRSV as shown in SARS coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus, reovirus, and sendai virus, bovine herpesvirus type 4 (Bitzer et al., 1999, Bordi et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2001, Pagnini et al., 2004, Rodgers et al., 1997). Although apoptosis is an end-stage process and does not play an important role in PRRSV replication in vitro, this does not exclude the possibility that apoptosis has an important contribution to PRRSV pathogenesis in vivo. In reovirus infection of mice, apoptosis is a major mechanism of reovirus-induced tissue injury (Clarke et al., 2005). It is also possible that PRRSV initially suppresses apoptotic pathways to maximize viral replication, but then at later times post-infection induces apoptosis to avoid an immune response and/or induce persistent infection.",

Our previous study showed that PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress via ROS production in MARC-145 cells (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005). Because ROS is known to activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis mediated by cytochrome c and caspase-9 (Chen et al., 2003), we determined if ROS produced by PRRSV was involved in inducing apoptosis. Treatments with three antioxidants (PDTC, NAC, and rotenone) protected cells from PRRSV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that oxidative stress may play a role in intrinsic apoptosis induction by PRRSV. Mitochondria are a major source of ROS and rotenone is a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial superoxide generation. Thus the anti-apoptotic effect of rotenone on PRRSV-infected cells indicates that mitochondrial-derived ROS may be involved in PRRSV-induced apoptosis. Oxidative stress induced by oxygen radicals and nitric oxide (NO) is a key event in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. For example, oxidative stress in chronic hepatitis C virus infection interferes with antiviral innate immune responses and exacerbates lung injury (Wang and Weinman, 2006). Tissue injury by oxidative stress is also associated with encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and reovirus, dementia caused by human immunodeficiency virus, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by measles virus (Steiner et al., 2006, Valyi-Nagy and Dermody, 2005). In addition to tissue injury, recent studies revealed that NO-induced oxidative stress accelerates viral mutation which may increase the heterogeneity of RNA viruses and lead to viral evolution under selective pressures (Akaike, 2001). It is possible that a cellular oxidative stress caused by ROS production plays a central role in PRRSV-induced apoptosis/necrosis and is involved in PRRSV pathogenesis based upon our findings. However, further studies are needed to determine mechanism(s) by which PRRSV induces oxidative stress, the viral protein(s) responsible for oxidative stress, and the role of oxidative stress in PRRSV pathogenesis in vivo.",

The observation that caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, reduced the amount of fragmented DNA released from PRRSV-infected cells indicates that caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by PRRSV could be followed by secondary necrosis. Apoptotic cells are removed by phagocytosis in vivo, but in vitro apoptotic cells undergo secondary necrosis in which the apoptotic bodies swell and eventually lyse (Wu et al., 2001). A study has shown that PRRSV induces apoptosis followed by a necrotic-like cell death at later times p.i. Characteristics of late apoptosis such as nuclear condensation, DNA laddering, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining were only detected in unattached PRRSV-infected cells which were dead (Kim et al., 2002). This result provides additional evidence of necrosis secondary to apoptosis induction in PRRSV-infected cells although there is some disagreement with the present study. Other studies demonstrated that PRRSV leads to cell death by both apoptosis and necrosis mechanisms in MARC-145 cells and pig monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Miller and Fox, 2004, Wang et al., 2007).",

In other words, there could be some cells in early stages of viral replication; therefore, apoptotic signals were too weak to be detected by the method used.

However, it is still controversial whether PRRSV induces apoptosis directly in infected cells or indirectly in uninfected bystander cells via inflammatory cytokines. Discrepancies among these studies could be explained by several factors including different cell types, a fibroblast cell line versus immune cells which are able to produce high level of cytokines, in vitro versus in vivo infection, and the techniques used to measure apoptosis. Previous studies used DNA fragmentation as an apoptosis marker, which cannot detect cells in early stages of apoptosis. Therefore, if most PRRSV-infected cells were in early apoptosis process, those cells would not be detectable by the TUNEL assay. Our study showed that a majority of apoptotic cells were characterized by both early and late apoptosis markers and were PRRSV-infected. Apoptosis was evident at 48 h and 60 h post-infection when a majority of cells (approximately 90%) became positive for PRRSV infection. Therefore, most cells undergoing apoptosis are PRRSV-infected cells rather than uninfected bystander cells. The possible involvement of a bystander effect was also indicated by increased surface expression FasL on PRRSV-infected cells.",

Based on our findings, a schematic model of PRRSV-induced apoptosis mechanisms is suggested, as shown in Fig. 11\n. This is the first comprehensive study demonstrating mechanisms by which PRRSV induces apoptosis. However, the relevance of apoptosis during PRRSV infection in vivo remains to be determined. To understand the role of apoptosis in PRRSV pathogenesis, further studies will define the steps involved in the apoptotic signal transduction cascade and the interaction of viral components and cellular factors in PRRSV-infected cells. In addition, infectious cDNA clones will be useful to study the role of apoptosis in PRRSV pathogenesis since related PRRSV isolates of differing virulence can be compared based on their ability to induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.",
