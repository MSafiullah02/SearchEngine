Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (FPMRS) must provide high quality of care through remote access such as telemedicine. No clear guidelines exist on the use of telemedicine in FPMRS. Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic. Methods We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms. We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines. We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Results Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments. Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.",

Since there are currently no effective treatments or vaccines to prevent COVID-19, focus is placed on infection prevention through social distancing and quarantine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have set forth recommendations to prevent infections in healthcare settings by decreasing or eliminating non-urgent office visits. Telehealth refers to any healthcare process that occurs remotely, including provider training or team meetings, whereas telemedicine specifically describes using technology to connect a patient to a provider. To enable patients to retain access to healthcare, many countries have revised regulations to allow health care providers to use telemedicine and receive appropriate reimbursement [1] . For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the USA have broadened access to, and reimbursement for, telemedicine services, allowing Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) providers the opportunity to provide continuity of care to existing patients who would otherwise remain disconnected.",

We grouped these scenarios into diagnoses that would (1) likely require different treatment with telemedicine compared with in-person treatment or (2) would utilize accepted behavioral counseling and not deviate from current management paradigms. Expedited literature reviews were performed for four scenarios in which virtual management of patients would differ from direct visits [telemedicine in FPMRS patients, pessary management, urinary tract infection (UTIs), and urinary retention]. For scenarios in which the management via telemedicine would be similar to traditional conservative management (urinary and fecal incontinence, prolapse, defecatory dysfunction, and fecal incontinence), established algorithms and existing systematic reviews of conservative management were reviewed and summarized. Finally, expert consensus compiled and summarized the following; FPMRS conditions that are amenable to telemedicine management, urgent situations requiring in-person visits, symptoms that should alert FPMRS providers for possible , and what FPMRS providers should consider when caring for patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19.",

Our analysis included three randomized controlled trials, three prospective cohorts, and one retrospective cohort. By metaanalysis (see Appendix 1), we estimated the following risks with continuous pessary use (no interval cleaning or examination) between 6 and 24 months: vaginal erosion or bleeding 5.0% (95% CI 1.9, 9.0), vaginal discharge 5.8% (95% CI 3.6, 8.5), vaginitis 1.8% (95% CI 0.2, 4.6), voiding dysfunction 4.7% (95% CI 1. 4, 9.8) , and fistula 0% (95% CI 0, 1.1). Based on review of the literature (16 studies) and expert consensus: [16] . Use of a specific telemedicine encounter is preferred for tracking and reimbursement purposes over a telephone encounter (typically used for sharing of discrete information) & Patients can safely extend the time interval between pessary cleanings to 6 months (and, in some cases, up to 24 months) with minimal risk of adverse events [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . & Patients capable of pessary removal and reinsertion should be encouraged to self-clean their pessary [27, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . & Providers should consider empiric vaginal estrogen to minimize adverse events for patients not already using vaginal estrogen [17, 18, 28, 31, 33] . & For patients reporting copious vaginal discharge or bleeding, it may be appropriate to encourage home self-removal and to observe for symptoms such as voiding dysfunction until patients can safely be evaluated in the office (EC). & Empiric treatment for bacterial vaginosis could be considered (EC).",

Of note, most of our literature review and review of expert opinion was in line with the International Guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESMID) recommendations, including choice of antibiotic for first-line therapy [84] . With recurrent UTI patients, although recent recommendations by the American Urological Association (AUA), Canadian Urological Association (CUA), and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) cited grade C evidence for cultures with every episode, the same level of evidence supports offering patient-initiated treatment when awaiting urine cultures [65] .",

Risk factors that predict poor success with CISC include obesity, poor dexterity, cognitive impairment, and pain with catheterization [105] [106] [107] . & When patients call with symptoms of possible urinary retention, consider instruction in behavioral modification prior to recommending CISC. This includes encouraging the patient to create a relaxing environment with adequate time for voiding while taking slow deep breaths and relaxing their pelvic floor muscles [94] . Patients could also be instructed to double or triple void [116] or in the use of the Crede maneuver (expert consensus). & If behavioral modifications fail, patients should be given the option of CISC. A prescription for catheters can be called into a pharmacy (delivery may be available), and remote teaching of the CISC technique can be attempted. If video conferencing is available, patients could be taught to use a clean technique with a mirror. Initially, the patient lies down and inserts a small-gauge (e.g., 10, 12, or 14 French) catheter. When proficient with the mirror, she can be instructed to insert the catheter by feel in the sitting or standing position. Online instructional videos are also available (https://vimeo. com/261183016) [95, 117] and online patient handouts are available as well (https://www.yourpelvicfloor.org/media/ Intermittent_Self_Catheterization.pdf) [13] (https://www. voicesforpfd.org/assets/2/6/ISC.pdf) [13, 14] (EC). & Patients with postoperative urinary retention who need indwelling catheterization can be instructed regarding safe removal of the catheter on postoperative day 7 at home without an office visit by cutting the balloon port and/or desufflating the catheter balloon. Consider having the patient remove the catheter early in the day to allow for an inperson office visit later on the same day if necessary [114] . & While antibiotics may reduce the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria during short-term catheter use, there is no strong evidence supporting the use of prophylactic antibiotics after hospital discharge in women being catheterized for postoperative urinary retention [96, 97] .",

Pelvic organ prolapse can be challenging to evaluate without a physical examination. However, the virtual visit provides an opportunity to counsel patients on the pathophysiology, possible treatment options, and techniques to prevent progression. Similarly, for defecatory dysfunction and fecal incontinence, conservative measures listed in the table can be initiated to help alleviate patients' symptoms. It is important to note that a change in bowel habits, weight loss, and rectal bleeding may warrant referral to a gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon to rule out colorectal cancer [128, 129] . Of note, if a patient reports new onset fecal incontinence or acute worsening of fecal incontinence, she should be screened for other COVID-19 symptoms and then referred for the appropriate care, as diarrhea is a possible symptom of COVID-19.",

When a provider is considering the necessity of an in-office visit, they must weigh the risks of COVID-19 exposure taking into account the current status of the outbreak in that specific region, the severity of the patient complaint, as well as the age and comorbidities of the patient. It appears that older age, diabetes, and immunosuppression increase the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection [138] . As there are no guidelines on clinic visits during a pandemic for this specialty, group consensus was obtained, and a list of reasons that may require an inperson visit was generated ( Table 2 ). Providers should also consider a clinic visit if there is a reasonable chance a physical examination or office diagnostic testing may change the course of treatment for an urgent complaint.",

Thus, it is important for FPMRS providers to be aware of COVID-19 symptoms that should prompt a referral for further evaluation and testing. For example, upper respiratory symptoms and bowel changes are possible presenting symptoms for COVID-19. A patient with an increase in their stress incontinence due to a dry cough or worsened fecal incontinence due to diarrhea should trigger consideration for further COVID-19 screening based on the regional protocol. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has advised postponing elective cases until after the acute COVID-19 crisis abates [139] . General guidance to assist FPMRS and other surgical specialties with staged postponement of surgical cases has been published [140] . During the pandemic, there will be a need for urgent surgical intervention in some situations, and a plan for management of these non-elective cases is required. A brief review of perioperative considerations for non-elective cases including COVID-19 positive cases was generated (Table 3) [141, 142]. When discussing surgical intervention with patients negative for COVID-19 infection, surgeons should discuss the unique risks of nosocomial COVID-19 infection during the consent process, including the efforts undertaken to protect the patient and the challenges of preventing contamination. Also consideration should be placed on ERAS and same-day discharge to decrease risk and exposure to patients.",

Literature searches were conducted from database inception through March 29, 30, or 31, 2020.

The authors concluded that virtual visits can provide similar patient satisfaction by building strong therapeutic relationships with patients through education, active listening, and shared decisionmaking [9] . These findings were confirmed in a rural extension project which focused on the impact of telemedicine on women with stress urinary incontinence who may have unique barriers to in-person visits.

The second group was asymptomatic patients who were found to have a mesh erosion on physical examination. Previous studies showed that about 50% of patients following anterior colporrhaphy or midurethral sling could be followed telephonically, but this was confounded by the high rate of complex, combined surgical procedures and perioperative complications. Therefore, this study suggests that a more selective postoperative cohort may be best suited for telephone follow-up after surgery, specifically following MUS for patients without incontinence and following POP repair without mesh implantation. In the current COVID-19 healthcare crisis, there is growing pressure to reduce the volume of patients seen in person and to convert visits to telemedicine. Typically, surgeons feel compelled to see all postoperative patients, but these data suggest that we may be able to stratify patients by perioperative risk and decrease the total number of direct-care visits to enhance physical distancing. Even postoperative FPMRS patients derived from a high-volume, expert surgical practice who participated in telephone contact following pelvic surgery demonstrated high patient satisfaction and no difference in adverse events, ER, or PCP visits or clinical outcomes [10] . Located in the western US, this group suggested that implementation of alternative methods for delivering health care should incorporate considerations for household income, distance traveled, and need for accompaniment.",

Strategic pre-screening of patients for virtual visits by home completion of a symptom assessment provides an opportunity for FPMRS providers to triage eligible patients.

Another study found that empiric treatment with TMP-SMZ was most cost-effective at the cost of $90.02 per episode [86] . Empiric therapy as a strategy was less costly (14 pounds) than any strategy with laboratory testing, and laboratory testing costs 215 pounds per single day of avoided symptoms [87] . Regarding the cost of various antibiotics, Israeli national recommendations of nitrofurantoin use as an empiric antibiotic was found to be cost-effective ($14.93 \u00b1 $8.18 at a slightly higher cost than TMP-SMZ $0.64 \u00b1 $3.84 and ofloxacin $2.75 \u00b1 $4.23) in a retrospective cohort study [42] . Another cost-decision analysis found that nitrofurantoin was cost-effective when the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance exceeded 12% among uropathogens or the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance exceeded 17% [88] . A cost/decision analysis of the strategy of fluoroquinolone use at various levels of TMP-SMZ resistance found that empiric use of fluoroquinolones was cost-effective when TMP-SMZ resistance in the community was 22% (cost of fluoroquinolone $107 and cost of TMP-SMZ $106 at this resistance level) [68] . For this reason, TMP-SMZ and nitrofurantoin seem most cost-effective, with nitrofurantoin being preferred in settings of TMP-SMZ resistance and fluoroquinolones reserved for when neither are appropriate.",

A prospective cohort study of use of fosfomycin 3 g orally in one dose demonstrated efficacy of this empiric strategy, with a 92.8% susceptibility and all patients having improvement in symptoms [50] . A regional study of European countries indicated that nitrofurantoin had the lowest resistance rate (< 5%) as opposed to penicillins (20-60%), TMP-SMZ (21-36%), fluoroquinolones (19-40%), and cephalosporins (2-17%) [46] . An expert review from the infectious disease arena recommended fosfomycin or nitrofurantoin for empiric therapy based on this reasoning [62] . A second prospective study across the nation of Spain advocated cefixime, with a susceptibility of 99% with use as an empiric therapy, as opposed to augmentin, which was < 66% [38] . In contrast, in a large systematic review of studies that compared various antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs, the meta-analyses supported the use of a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin) based on these data [78] , but these data did not include cost analyses or antibiotic stewardship concerns, merely efficacy. A single-arm prospective study of nationwide French antibiotic susceptibility suggested fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, and nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, citing antimicrobial studies of susceptibility on all bacteria (97.8% fosfomycin, 91.5% nitrofurantoin, 98.3% ciprofloxacin; the lowest was ampicillin 61.4%) and E. coli only (99% fosfomycin, 97.1% pivmecillinam, 97.3% nitrofurantoin, 98.3% ciprofloxacin; the lowest was ampicillin at 61%) [55] .

In fact, a case-control study of non-pregnant adults with UTI symptoms indicated that use of levofloxacin in the past was a significant risk factor for fluoroquinolone resistance (2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-3.9), as was each week of additional hospitalization (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.1-27.5), and they suggested use of TMP-SMZ as empiric therapy to avoid this resistance [41] . An empiric 3-day course of TMP-SMZ, with reservation of fluoroquinolones for patients with recurrent or complicated UTIs or contraindications to sulfa drugs, was also advocated by several expert reviews [80, 81, 91] . Narrative reviews also pointed to the 2010 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) Guidelines (Pubmed 21,292,654) and, more recently, the 2017 EAU guidelines on urologic infections [81, 89] . A systematic review summarizing uncomplicated UTI treatment advocated for recommendations very similar to the IDSA guidelines [77] .

In a retrospective cohort of 4351 patients in the US and Canada, in a setting where ciprofloxacin resistance was high (40%; 95% CI, 39.5%-40.5%), it was found that correspondence of a future culture to a prior culture was 57% [95% CI, 55%-59% at 4-8 weeks between the cultures (at 32 weeks between cultures 49%; 95% CI, 48%-50%)], whereas sensitivity to antibiotics was the same or better in 57% (95% CI, 55%-59%), both of which were better (p < 0.05) compared with chance alone [48] . In this study, factors that predicted correspondence to a prior culture were less time between the two cultures, younger age, no antibiotics between cultures, no negative culture between, cultures obtained during the same admission, an outpatient setting, and an E. coli organism [48] . A retrospective cohort in Europe also found that resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim, or ciprofloxacin is maintained for 3 months at least, while susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, or trimethoprim in a previous sample supports their prescription for a re-infection for up to a year, and resistance to nitrofurantoin is low and short lived [62] . In cases of complicated UTIs, a retrospective cohort found that empiric treatment based on culture results in the last 6 months was an inappropriate choice only 23% of the time and empiric therapy based on no prior culture results was inappropriate in choice 67% of the time, where the odds ratio of accurate treatment was 6.9 (95% CI 2.7 to 17.1) if prior culture data were used and 9.8 (95% CI 2.2 to 43.1) if subsequent culture was the same species [47] . For neurogenic patients in a single-arm retrospective study [52] , there was 56% correspondence with the same organism and for antibiotic sensitivity correspondence was 77.3% for ciprofloxacin, 78.5% for nitrofurantoin, and 75% for TMP-SMX. Therefore, we advocate that past cultures, if available between recently and up to 1 year ago, should be used to guide therapy chosen over telemedicine visits regarding UTIs.",

They do suggest assessing which patients with CUR are high risk based on the following risk factors: imaging studies showing hydronephrosis, hydroureter and/or bladder stones; laboratory findings that indicate stage 3 chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45-49 ml/min/1.73 m 2 [stage 3A] or 30-44% [stage 3B]), and recurrent symptomatic UTIs (any pyelonephritis, \u2265 3 UTIs in a 12-month period, and any episode of urosepsis in a 6month period).

Drug treatments assessed included cholinergic agents, alpha-blockers, sedatives, and prostaglandin. The only remote therapy that showed a statistically significant association with improved likelihood of spontaneous voiding compared with placebo (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.82) was a combination of cholinergic agents combined with sedative. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the two studies in this analysis, and only one of the two treatments could be given remotely. The outcome was not statistically different between the three arms in this individual study. Thus, there is no evidence from this review that orally administered drugs successfully treat urinary retention after surgery. This conclusion is consistent with that of another review article that clearly states that alpha-blockers, specifically, are not superior to placebo in the treatment of acute urinary retention in women [99] .",

At 24 h postoperatively, various assessments were made using subjective criteria. There were mixed results in regard to the efficacy compared to placebo, and no primary outcome was defined. Tamsulosin was not more effective than placebo with respect to the frequency of urinary retention (78.5% vs. 63.1%, p = 0.054). Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying was higher in the tamsulosin group (76.9% vs. 63.1%), and the incidence of urinary retention was significantly lower in the tamsulosin group (20% vs. 36.9%), as was residual bladder volume and diameter of urinary flow.",

The first is guideline 39, \"Systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis should not be routinely used in patients with short-term or long-term catheterization, including patients who undergo surgical procedures, to reduce CA-asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) or CA-UTI because of concern about selection of antimicrobial resistance.\" The second is guideline 39, \"Data are insufficient to make a recommendation as to whether routine catheter change (e.g., every 2-4 weeks) in patients with functional long-term indwelling urethral or supra-pubic catheters reduces the risk of CA-ASB or CA-UTI, even in patients who experience repeated early catheter blockage from encrustation.\"",

It is also important to note that use of an \u03b1-agonist, such as duloxetine, is considered off-label use in the UStates but is an approved indication in Europe. Incontinence pessaries are a common treatment option for SUI, but there were insufficient data for evaluation in the systematic review; likewise, data were lacking regarding a patient-fitted device (Uresta) or use of an incontinence tampon (Impressa), although the overall risk should be low and may be an option for patients while avoiding in-person clinic visits [119, 124] .",

The data on the comparative efficacy of a \u00df 3 -adrenoceptor agonist are evolving, but this different drug class has less or no dementia risk compared with anticholinergics. Hypertension is one of the concerns for this class of medication; however, two recent systematic reviews did not show any increased risk of hypertension over placebo [121, 122] .
