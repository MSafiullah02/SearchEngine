Among the resistant Gram-positive pathogens, methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate or -resistant S. aureus (VISA or VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are of great concern because of the importance of these organisms in causing various types of nosocomial infections [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Increases in the prevalence of these resistant pathogens in hospitals are frequently related to the high selective pressure of antibiotics, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Newer antimicrobial agents (oxazolidinones, daptomycin and streptogramins) with novel antimicrobial mechanisms have been developed to treat infections caused by these resistant Gram-positive bacteria [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Among these agents, linezolid was introduced in Taiwan in 2002, and quinupristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin will be available within the next few years.",

Susceptibility testing for S. aureus and enterococci followed the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines [29]. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 were used as control strains for routine disk susceptibility testing [29]. Methicillin resistance in S. aureus was routinely screened by growth of the isolate on a trypticase soy agar plate containing oxacillin 6 mg/L plus 2% NaCl and incubated in ambient air at 35 \u00b0C for 24 h [29], [30], [31]. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci was further confirmed by growth of the isolate on a brain heart infusion (BHI) agar with vancomycin 6 mg/L [29], [30], [31] and incubated in ambient air at 35 \u00b0C for 24 h.

High rates of vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporin use have been reported to be associated with increased prevalence of VRE in hospitals [1], [2], [9], [33], [34]. The risk of VRE colonisation varies during exposure to different \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials, with higher tendency to promote colonisation in cefotetan, ceftriaxone or ceftazidime [7], [12], [33]. Our study also confirmed that consumption of all fluoroquinolones (but not injectable ciprofloxacin alone) is positively correlated with an increased rate of VRE. Further research should be conducted to clarify this association.",

Furthermore, the increased resistance could be a general trend (as is happening worldwide) and widespread use antimicrobials might contribute partly to this trend. Second, the rate of MRSA and VRE may be overestimated due to the possible hospital-wide dissemination of clonally-related isolates [4], [14], [39].
