In recent years, knowledge of the prevalence of RNAi and the mechanism of gene silencing through RNAi has started to unfold. It is now believed that RNAi serves in part as an innate response against invading viral pathogens and, indeed, counter silencing mechanisms aimed at neutralizing RNAi have been found in various viral pathogens. During the past few years, it has been demonstrated that RNAi, induced by specifically designed double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, can silence gene expression of human viral pathogens both in acute and chronic viral infections. Furthermore, it is now apparent that in in vitro and in some in vivo models, the prospects for this technology in developing therapeutic applications are robust. However, many key questions and obstacles in the translation of RNAi into a potential therapeutic platform still remain, including the specificity and longevity of the silencing effect, and, most importantly, the delivery of the dsRNA that induces the system. It is expected that for the specific examples in which the delivery issue could be circumvented or resolved, RNAi may hold promise for the development of gene-specific therapeutics.",

            "text": "The battle against viral infections is ferocious. Since viruses are developing resistance to therapy, novel antiviral therapeutic modalities are in great demand. The currently approved antiviral therapies are based on the use of small molecular weight drugs, utilization of proteins simulating the innate immune response, and the adaptive immune system for both passive and active vaccination [1] . Recently, an antisense drug against viral infection has also been approved, suggesting that newly developed approaches are acceptable. The first drug using antisense technology, Fomivirsen (Vitravene), developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals, was approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. In general, small molecular weight drugs are mainly used today for chronic viral disease, although there are exceptions such as the anti-influenza compound, Oseltamivir/Tamiflu, which is used for acute infection. Passive and active vaccination approaches are being developed for the prevention of severe acute diseases (in this case, there are also exceptions, such as life administration of anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies to liver transplant patients at risk for HBV infection recurrence). The development and use of specific antiviral drugs and vaccines have been slower than expected and face major challenges. One particular example is the sluggish progress in generating effective drugs against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), even though the genomic sequence of the virus was unfolded over 15 years ago. HIV drug development also faces major drawbacks. Although HIV replication is efficiently inhibited by the combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), long-term complications of HAART include significant morbidity on the one hand, and the generation of multi-drug-resistant HIV strains on the other in a large proportion of patients.",

The need for preventive and effective vaccines remains as much a requisite today as it was in previous times in the history of mankind. Indeed, at the beginning of the previous century, the world suffered devastating viral infection pandemics such as the one that occurred in 1918 where a quarter of the world population fell ill and the death toll reached over 25 million people from acute influenza infection. Today, the achievement of peak vaccine efficacy to treat influenza stands at 75% among those under 65 years old and just 35% among the elderly. Even today, the annual death toll from acute influenza infection in the USA tops 20,000 in spite of national vaccination programs. Thus, different strategies are currently being suggested in an effort to be prepared for future pandemics [2] , and these include the development of escape mutants (antigenic drift) and reassortment of genetic segments of different quasispecies of the same virus or of different viruses (antigenic shift). Presently, human viral pathogens are spreading worldwide, such as the much publicized menacing spread of the avian flu which is reported to have expanded to remote sites of Russia and Kazakhstan from the South-East, posing a major health threat to the entire world.",

These small dsRNA duplexes have 2 nt overhang at their 3 end, a 5 -monophosphate and a 3 -hydroxyl group [6] . The enzyme responsible for that first step is Dicer, a dsRNA-specific nuclease that belongs to the RNaseIII family, and acts in an ATP-dependent manner [7] . In the next step, the siRNAs generated by the Dicer are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a multi-component enzymatic complex [5] . The RISC unwinds the siRNA in an ATP-dependent manner, and uses its single-strand form to target the homologous transcript by base-pairing interactions. It then cleaves the mRNA by its endonuclease component in a homology-dependent manner, only in the region corresponding to the sequence of the siRNA. This process leads to degradation of the mRNA [4, 8] .",

The genome of RNA viruses, especially with plus polarity, serves both as mRNA and as a replication template. Many research groups applied the siRNA method to inhibit replication of viruses in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of an efficient cell culture system for growing HCV, the sensitivity of HCV to RNAi was shown in the replicon-based system. An HCV replicon is derived from an HCV consensus genome that was cloned from a viral RNA isolated from an infected human and used to construct subgenomic selectable replicons. Upon transfection of these subgenomic selectable constructs into a cell line, these RNAs were found to replicate to high levels. In several studies, siRNAs were directed against different targets in the virus genome [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . For example, siRNA specific for the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of the HCV genome, introduced into Huh7 cells carrying the replicon system, inhibits HCV replication by up to 90% [20] , as measured by the expression level of the replicon luciferase reporter gene. siRNAs targeting the viral polymerase NS5B region reduced expression of NS5B-Luc chimera in mice [27] or in the replicon system in vitro. Other studies that target other regions of the HCV genome reported a significant decline in the level of HCV proteins and the level of both the sense and antisense RNA strands [25] .

Likewise, expression vectors of siRNAs specific for two different regions of the WNV genome protected 293T cells from WNV infection, and significantly reduced viral RNA replication and virus production [35] . Coxackievirus B3 (CVB3), a member of the Picornaviridae family, is a major cause of many human diseases, such as meningioencephalitis and myocarditis. Synthetic siRNA targeted to the VP1 or to the viral polymerase showed antiviral effects in infected HeLa cells by inducing a significant reduction of viral replication [37] . The footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication was inhibited in BHK-21 cells by siRNAs targeting various conserved regions of the FMDV genome [38] . Multiple siRNAs have been used to target multiple conserved viral genes that are essential for virus replication, including a long 5non-coding region, a short 3 -non-coding region, the viral protein VPg, the viral polymerase, and the viral capsid protein VP4. The combination of those siRNAs gave rise to a 10-1,000-fold inhibition in virus yield by specific inhibition of viral replication [38] . The antiviral properties of RNAi have not been assessed in comparison for their effectiveness upon targeting the different intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. However, from current reports, we could surmise that targeting viral replication, similar to what has been described in several other types of antiviral methods, would probably be the suggested approach to suppress viral infection. Replication of DNA viruses can be inhibited by targeting their viral mRNA, whereas replication of RNA viruses can be inhibited by targeting either their mRNAs or their viral RNA, as was elegantly demonstrated for HIV [39] .",

Moreover, most of the viral particles that were produced were poorly infectious [40] .

Using a pool of siRNAs to simultaneously target multiple sites in the viral genome can prevent the emergence of these resistant viruses [42, 43] . Another approach that may partially solve this problem is targeting cellular factors rather than viral genes. During their life cycle, viruses apply cell membrane receptors for penetration, and cellular transcription factors for viral replication, harnessing very efficiently the cellular transcription and translation machinery for their life cycle. Targeting those cellular genes may be another strategy for inhibition of viruses. And indeed, Zhang et al., for example, succeeded in suppressing the replication of HCV in the replicon system by the expression of siRNAs against cellular cofactors that are needed for viral replication, the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) or eIF2Bg [44] . Inhibition of the PTB alone by siRNAs resulted in an efficient decrease in the levels of HCV proteins as well as HCV RNA replication in Huh7 cells harboring the HCV replicon [45] . In another study, siRNA against cellular RNA helicase p68 reduced HCV negative strand replication [46] . The E7 protein of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) contributes to oncogenesis. E7 was found to specifically activate the transcription of the cellular transcription factor E2F2 in an in vitro system of differentiating human keratinocytes. While suppression of E2F2 levels through the use of siRNA decreased HPV replication, this loss did not affect cell proliferation. Thus, E2F2 is a potential target for antiviral therapies [47] .",

In each case, the best strategy for viral inhibition needs to be assessed according to the virus type and its unique life cycle. Interestingly, a combination therapy of two siRNAs, targeting different viral sequences, each with inhibitory function, did not have an enhanced effect. This was also found by other groups, assessing the RNAi effect in other human and non-human pathogens. These repeated observations could be related to the early saturation of the RNAi cellular machinery. However, this issue will need further investigation, which could lead to improvement of the efficacy of RNAi against viral infections.",

However, in most cases, the viral agent causing the acute severe endemic, possibly pandemic disease, could be rapidly identified and sequenced, as was the case during the recent outbreak of SARS. In these cases, the development of siRNAs targeted against various regions of the viral genome could lead to a quick development of a therapy against the acute viral infection. The production, delivery, dose, and modes of administration of siRNAs could be tailor-designed for any group of targets. Suffice to say, it is imperative that the timetable for the generation of a new siRNA-based RNA silencing drug could be shorter, so that a therapeutic platform against many specific infectious agents with pandemic potential could be forthcoming. Obviously, it must be remembered that additional important factors need to be implemented for the development of an antiviral drug, such as in vitro and in vivo models, although these requirements are essential for any other type of therapeutic modality to be produced and tested. One recent report nicely exemplified the fact that synthetic siRNA could be generated against a single (respiratory syncytial virus, RSV) or a double infection (with parainfluenza virus, PIV), and rapidly tested in vitro, as a sufficiently predictive tool for an in vivo effect [65] . In this report, the siRNAs against both RSV and PIV were administered nasally with profound antiviral preventive and therapeutic effects without inducing interferon production. As mentioned in previous sections, siRNA is very effective against other life-threatening pandemic threats such as influenza infections [66] . However, it must be remembered that we are probably just at the beginning of experimental assessments to determine the potential antiviral effects of siRNA.",

In addition, this same group also showed that the antisense siRNA strand is critical for the RNAi effect and that single nucleotide mutations at the central or 5 regions are detrimental for the antiviral effect. siRNA was also effective against SARS caused by the newly discovered coronavirus in a preventive model in vitro [68] . Currently, since there is no available effective specific therapy against SARS, RNAi could be developed for this serious infection. In other cases of severe human infections by viral pathogens, there are fewer promising results than for the antiviral potential against viral replication by inducing RNAi. siRNA was also assessed against WNV infection. In one report, while the investigators failed to show an antiviral effect in active replicating cells [69] , they showed prevention of infection in a previous report. Another group assessed the potential effect of siRNA against WNV infection in vivo. Again, only a preventive mode of therapy was found partially effective against viral replication and disease outcome in mice [70] . From the reports on the use of siRNA against human viral pathogens causing acute disease, we could learn that for each specific pathogen infecting a specific cell lineage or tissue, we would probably need to perform an indepth assessment, with proper in vitro and in vivo models, and develop specific delivery systems. Although the road towards RNAi development could be visible for some of its destinations and the traveling speed could be changing, the target time remains unknown and unpredictable. An interesting new approach of preventing viral infection was reported by the group of Judy Lieberman [71] . In an effort to suggest a method of prevention of HSV2 sexual transmission, intravaginal installation of siRNAs targeting two HSV-2 genes protected mice from a lethal HSV-2 challenge without inducing interferon-responsive genes. This encouraging result once again proves that combining a realistic method of gene delivery with a specific genetic drug payload for a specific disease could result in a beneficial gene therapy outcome.",

However, in those cases where the virus causes severe disease as a result of a significant cytopathic effect, which could be related to a high multiplicity of infection (MOI), low immunogenicity, high replication capacity or direct toxic effects, or a combination of all, could result in organ failure or even death. In these cases, RNAi could significantly support, or even enhance, the antiviral effects for a short period of time and this could be achieved by the administration of siRNAs. Characterizing the specific viral pathogen, even in a pandemic situation, could enhance the rational design of a sequence-specific siRNA that can be used as therapy. This situation is very different from cases of chronic viral infections of RNA viruses, in that there could be quasispecies; in addition, the effect of the RNAi should be prolonged and generated through an expression system rather than through a synthetic siRNA administered once or only a few times.",

Due to the overlapping gene structure of the HBV genome, targeting a region in the open reading frame (ORF) of the X gene which is shared by all the viral transcripts resulted in a significant reduction of up to 90% in all viral transcripts and proteins and in a dramatic reduction of \u223c95% in viral replication [75] . The X gene of HBV was also recently assessed as a target for RNAi in vivo [77] . Using two HBV mice models as a naked DNA approach with the hydrodynamic method or expressed from an adenovector, the Pol III U6 promoter encoded short shRNAs targeting conserved sequences of the HBx ORF. The anti-HBV effect was significant without stimulating the interferon system. It is also known that HBx plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. siRNA against HBx was also used to test its effect against hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines which express HBx sequences [78] . This group demonstrated a significant reduction in cell proliferation, cell growth, anchorageindependent growth in soft agar, and tumor development in nude mice following the expression of siRNA against HBx. A recent report suggested that the inhibitory effect of RNAi on HBV expression is stronger than that of Lamivudine in vitro [79] . We could further speculate that a combination of RNAi and nucleoside analogs might encounter a synergistic effect, although this is yet to be determined.",

This also applies when designing an RNAi approach for HCV infection, as well as for other chronic viral infections. The studies assessing the effect of RNAi against HCV were mostly restricted to in vitro replicon systems, as discussed above. Alternative in vivo systems were also adopted by some investigators, with reporting proteins used to assess the antiviral effect [80] . In early studies using the in vitro HCV replicon system, it was shown that a synthetic siRNA targeting the 5 core region of HCV inhibited viral proteins and significantly suppressed viral replication for at least 8 days [21] . At about the same time, a different group showed, also in the replicon system, that siRNA against the NS5B region (viral polymerase) is most effective in suppressing HCV replication [19] . This group had also transfected the HuH7 replicon cells with a vector expressing complementary strands of siRNA, again targeting the NS5B region, under the control of two separate H1 promoters (pCEP4, Invitrogen). In this case, the suppression effect on HCV replication lasted over 3 weeks. Another group targeted similar HCV regions, NS3 and NS5B [26] ; they introduced shRNAs targeted against these two genes into Huh7-replicon cells. The delivery systems that were used in their study were plasmids or lentiviral vectors harboring shRNAs against NS3 or NS5B, expressed from the U6 promoter. In both cases, they observed similar effects, i.e., suppression of HCV proteins and viral replication. However, shRNA against the 5 -UTR of HCV resulted in very low levels of inhibition of HCV replication.",

Although the results of these studies suggest that HIV could be targeted by RNAi, there are major obstacles in translating this therapeutic approach into the clinical setting. Most reports have used sequences from laboratory HIV strains. Viruses with mutations at the RNAi recognition site produced an escape mutant after a long-term RNAi pressure. Targeting relatively conserved HIV sequences could improve the efficacy of the RNAi effect. A recent study looked at the protective effect of shRNAs targeting the rev, gag, and vif sequences of a panel of HIV clades [82] . This study showed that targeting the vif HIV region had a significant inhibition effect on HIV replication. However, the long-term use of any specific siRNA or shRNA against HIV could probably induce the generation of escape mutants containing nucleotide substitutions at or near the target sites. Furthermore, the escape from RNAimediated inhibition could also signify the emergence of mutations that change the HIV RNA secondary structures [83] . All of these data emphasize the significance of HIV evolution during RNAi pressure and its potential impact on the use of RNAi against HIV. The virus also harbors a specific mechanism that evades the nucleicacid-based innate immunity of human cells against HIV. The genome of HIV contains a plethora of dsRNA regions capable of being processed into siRNAs targeting the viral genome to suppression [84] . However, the virus has evolved by a counter process, rendering itself resistant to RNAi through the Tat protein, altering the Dicer effect on viral sequences, and abrogating the host cell innate immunity against HIV infection. Interestingly, on the other hand, it is possible that HIV does apply the cellular RNAi machinery for regulation of its own gene expression. The HIV nef region encodes a microRNA, miR-N367, which can block nef expression [85] . Later, it was shown by the same group that miR-N367 targets the HIV LTR promoter region, downregulating viral transcription; this might be a mechanism by which the virus regulates its own transcription [86] .",

            "text": "Single anti-HIV therapy is ineffective against viral replication and gene expression due to the high mutation rate of the virus. One option of overcoming this major obstacle is to generate therapeutics against highly conserved viral genomic regions. A recent report showed that it is possible to clone shRNAs against the conserved regions of the HIV genome into HIV vectors, and to suppress HIV infection upon targeting the gag, pol, int and vpu sequences [87] . However, although this approach could be applied for prevention of infection, cessation of an ongoing HIV replication is prone to failure due to the high mutation rate of the virus. An alternative strategy could be to target essential cellular determinants for HIV infection. The early step of HIV infection would be attaching to the viral cellular receptor. During the progressive stage of the disease, most HIV isolates use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 for viral attachment and penetration into the host cells. Patients with mutations of the CXCR4 receptor are less prone to HIV infection and are healthy by any significant measure. This finding was the rationale used to develop an anti-HIV approach by targeting CXCR4 expression and inhibiting viral fusion with the cellular membrane [54] . It is expected that such an approach will pose a major obstacle to viral evolution and prevent infection. Other groups have also adopted this strategy to render cells resistant to HIV infection [52, 53, [58] [59] [60] . The HIV regulatory protein, rev, is essential for viral life cycle in a number of ways including splicing, translation and trans-activation. With regard to rev trans-activation properties, it needs to interact with the hypusine-containing protein eIF-5A. The eIF-5A rev cofactor is activated following a catalytic step performed by the human deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS). A recent study has suggested that RNA interference inhibiting DHS blocked HIV replication [88] . Again, as with other drugs in development against HIV infection, we are confronted with the following major questions: what are the potential side effects from such an approach, and what would be the therapeutic dose window? Indeed, studies aimed at unfolding these issues are crucial before entering any clinical studies. Other groups have also suggested the targeting of other cellular factors essential for the HIV life cycle, including PARP-1 [55] , the elongation transcription factor P-TEFb [56] , cyclophilin A, DC-SIGN [61, 63] , the human elongation transcription factor SPT5 [64] , and human cyclin T1 [89] . The road towards the development of an efficient therapeutic modality using the anti-HIV RNA interference strategy is bumpy, due to potential side effects; moreover, significant strides will have to be made towards harnessing clearcut approaches as described, as well as designing additional rational studies through wet and dry investigations [89] .

Many plant DNA and RNA viruses have developed proteins that function as suppressors of RNA silencing [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] . Since the silencing suppression reduces the antiviral effects, the viruses can accumulate in their target cells and reach higher titers. Comparing those suppressor genes did not reveal any sequence homology between them. The RNA silencing suppressors can act upon the various sequences of the RNAi machinery in several ways such as inhibition of siRNA processing, inhibition of the incorporation step into the RISC, or preventing the action of its effector molecules. Although the mechanisms of inhibition of silencing are not fully understood, there are several suppressor genes that their targets have identified. The p19 protein from the tombusvirus was shown to bind specifically to the siRNAs, and thus may inhibit the incorporation step of the siRNAs into the silencing effector complexes [98] . The HC-Pro protein, expressed by polyviruses, acts by targeting the RISC [99, 100] . Another example is the mosaic virus 2b protein (Cmv2b). This nucleus-localized RNAi suppressor protein inhibits the activity of the spreading signal of the RNAi, and inhibits DNA methylation processes in the nucleus that control the silencing pathways [97, 101] . The coat protein of the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) strongly suppresses the RNA silencing process at an early initiation step, probably by interference with the function of the Dicer cleavage reaction [96] .",

And indeed, there is evidence that such inhibitors are not limited to plant viruses. In insects, the flock house virus (FHV) is a target of RNA silencing. It has been shown that in Drosophila and mosquito cultured cells, the FHV-encoded protein, B2, inhibited RNA silencing, but the mechanism is still unknown. This protein also inhibited RNAi in transgenic plants, suggesting that the RNA silencing pathway is conserved in plants and animals [92, 102, 103] . Recent evidence also indicates that human virus genes have the ability to inhibit the RNAi pathway. Both the influenza virus NS1 protein and the vaccinia virus E3L protein can inhibit RNAi in Drosophila S2 cultured cells [102] . The adenovirus encoded inhibitor of RNAi is functional in mammalian cells. The human adenovirus inhibits RNAi in the later stages of infection by suppressing the activity of Dicer and the RISC. The virus-associated RNAs, VA RNAI and VA RNAII, bind directly to Dicer and function as competitive substrates, squelching it, and the resulting siRNAs are incorporated into the active RISC [104, 105] . The antiviral therapeutic potential of RNAi would require identifying possible viral suppressors of the RNAi machinery and designing strategies to inhibit their expression.",

This is most apparent in cases where the fidelity of the viral polymerase is low, especially in viruses with an RNA genome. To overcome this hurdle, most antiviral therapeutic protocols harness a strategy that uses multiple drugs targeting different viral proteins or steps in its life cycle. One example where such resistance has been developed in vitro is in the case of RNAi against the Nef gene of HIV [106, 107] . To overcome this problem, it may be advisable to utilize a multi-targeted RNAi approach possibly in combination with additional antiviral modalities. Although targeting multiple genomic sites has probably no advantage with regard to the direct antiviral effect, it could repress the development of resistance. The initial steps towards focusing into this avenue have already been established. The group that initially described the siRNA effect in vitro in the replicon system against HCV [19] have shown that, following several rounds of treatment with the same siRNA against HCV, the replicon became resistant to that specific siRNA, developing a point mutation at the target site. However, the replicon was still sensitive to a siRNA targeting a different HCV region. In addition, the development of a resistant replicon was limited by the use of a combination of two siRNAs targeting simultaneously different HCV genomic regions [108] . A similar approach has also been suggested by other groups [109] .",

In experiments conducted on specificity of siRNA in cultured human cells, Jackson et al., have demonstrated that siRNA can cause direct downregulation of unintended targets containing as few as 11 contiguous bp complementarities [110] . To increase siRNA specificity, there are many siRNA design programs that employ various sequence alignment algorithms; however, maximum complementarity, by itself, is not enough for accurate prediction of off-targeting. A study done in Dharmacon Inc., identified a significant association between off-targeting and exact complementarity between the seed region of the siRNA (bases 2-7) and their offtargeted genes. This pattern has been recognized in miRNA-mediated gene silencing, thus suggesting that siRNA off-targeting may operate by a mechanism similar to that of miRNA targeting (A. Birmingham, personal communication). Until the off-target mechanism of siRNA is understood, this issue can encounter deleterious side effects on the use of RNAi.",

Although most studies suggest that there is very little non-specific effect of siRNA, others have shown that the Jak-Stat pathway is activated following siRNA transfection. This effect is mediated by dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) [111] . While we expect that this issue will foster additional debates, at this point, it would be important to impart cautious interpretations upon describing RNAi effects. In addition, recent studies have suggested that although siRNA does not activate the intracellular interferon machinery in mammalian cells upon entrance or in situ propagation inside the cells, if they are shorter than 30-nt dsRNA, there is a non-specific innate immune response depicted by cytokine production [112] . Furthermore, this effect is dependent on the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) that senses dsRNA and serves as its receptor. TLR3 is located intracellularly on the endosome membrane and signals through NF\u03baB nuclear translocation for the production of inflammatory cytokines. Incubation of immune cells with siRNA induces the activation of cells [113] . All of these effects could be dependent on the concentration of siRNA. Recent works identified putative immunostimulatory motifs within siRNAs, and showed that even a slight change of these motifs did not significantly hamper the RNAi process [114] . This research provides a basis for the design of synthetic siRNAs that avoids activation of the innate immune response, and helps to minimize immunotoxicity.",

            "text": "The effect subsides after 48 to 72 h and is probably completely lost after 7 days. The silencing effect of siRNA following systemic administration of duplex RNA could have been hampered by various factors, thus imposing some logistic hurdles upon translating this approach into the clinical setting (additional examples of RNAi against viral infections are depicted in Table 1 ). Although duplex RNA is quite stable in serum [124] , and more stable than ssDNA or ssRNA, a high serum concentration could reduce stability. The introduction of phosphorothioate linkages could enhance stability in the serum [124] . Others have used chemically modified siRNA with the complete absence of 2 -OH residues on the sense and antisense strands of the dsRNA, including 2 -fluoro, 2 -Omethyl and 2 -deoxy sugars. These chemical modifications of siRNA were produced in order to enhance its stability and effect [126] . Not all modifications have resulted in beneficial silencing effects [127] [128] [129] ; a short review of these modifications was reported by Paroo and Corey [130] . One particular interesting report [131] shows that a specific siRNA with a combined chemical modification had a significant and a relatively sustained effect in vitro and in vivo as compared to non-modified siRNA. However, although siRNA is relatively stable in the serum, there are disadvantages of using synthetic siRNA: (1) The effect of synthetic siRNA is transient; in order to impose a long-term effect, repeated administrations would be needed, and this might still be true for the chemically modified siRNAs. (2) The production of synthetic siRNA is expensive, making repeated administrations for longterm effect very costly. (3) It is very complicated to target synthetic siRNA to a specific cell or tissue. However, in specific cases, the use of siRNA directly administered into the target tissue could encounter a significant effect. In a recent report by Dorn et al., they used siRNA against the pain-related cation-channel P2X 3 , by intrathecal injection of phosphorothioated (PS) siRNA in a rat model of neuropathic pain [132] . Although they did not compare the non-PS-modified versus the PS-modified siRNA, they have clearly shown a significant effect of siRNA in relieving chronic pain. Furthermore, the effect was superior to the comparable P2X 3 antisense oligonucleotides. One specific case where such an approach could be translated into an applicable clinical therapeutic modality is in post-herpetic neuralgia which could follow Varicella-Zoster infection. However, since chronic pain is a condition that is generally expected to last for months, this type of treatment would need to be readministered several times. A recent report took advantage of the knowledge generated regarding the stabilization of siRNA by chemical modifications, and protection of the modified siRNA with pegylated liposomes upon delivery. They assessed the antiviral effect of siRNA against HBV in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the modified siRNA had induced less non-specific cytokine secretion combined with an effective and anti-HBV effect of up to 6 weeks after repeated weekly administrations [133] .",

            "text": "In an effort to enhance and prolong the effect of siRNA, various approaches have been undertaken using nonviral reagents. Tailoring the specific delivery tactic and method is essential when designing a specific therapeutic strategy. One example is the use of siRNA targeting the influenza virus genome. This malady can cause moderate to severe illness, can affect millions of people each year, and could be life-threatening. For the gene therapist, this means that the genetic therapy effect could be designed for a short window of time. In this case, the use of synthetic siRNA with an enhanced transduction is an appropriate approach. In a study by Ge et al., the systemic and intratracheal delivery of polyethylenimine (PEI), a cationic polymer, promoting siRNA delivery in mice, is beneficial for prophylaxis and therapy of the influenza virus infection [134] . PEI was developed for in vitro and in vivo local and systemic gene delivery and PEI-mediated gene delivery/transduction into the lung following systemic and intratracheal administrations. Some investigators reported safety problems in specific cases upon the use of PEI in animals. However, plasmid DNA mixed with PEI administered into the human bladder was safe (A. Hochberg, personal communication). Tompkins et al., also assessed the effect of siRNA against the same pathogen, the influenza virus [135] . This group used a different therapeutic regimen. They used a preventive measure by administering naked siRNA systemically, i.e., intravenously, before infection, and at the time of infection, they administered the siRNA/Oligofectamine \uf6db (a lipid carrier from Invitrogen) intranasally. In this model, the undertaken therapeutic approach prevented death of animals. However, this study was limited to asking the general question of siRNA effect against influenza virus infection rather than comparing different siRNA delivery systems. Thus, we cannot draw any conclusions that would suggest a preference for any specific delivery method in this disease model system. Future animal studies would be required to determine the preferred delivery method. In addition to the lipid carriers, traditionally developed for in vitro and in vivo delivery of DNA and now for siRNA, alternative approaches have also been developed. One specific interesting report by Minakuchi et al. describes the use of atelocollagen (AT) [136] . AT is prepared from type I collagen from calf dermis. This is a low immunogenic product that is already available in clinics for various indications like promoting wound healing. The same investigators showed that AT enhanced DNA delivery and supported prolonged expression. AT mediated the delivery of siRNA in vitro and was found in vivo to encounter a significant advantage over the siRNA/liposome complex in inhibiting tumor growth in mice. Recently, more sophisticated delivery methods of siRNA have also been developed to treat brain tumors [137] . The obtained results could be important for those interested in developing siRNA therapeutics for viral encephalitis. The model that they used in vivo to assess their delivery and RNAi effects was an immunodeficient mouse with an inoculated intracranial human U87 glioma tumor that was dependent on EGF signaling for growth. One of the major barriers for macromolecules to travel to diseased tissue in the brain is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Passing the BBB is a major challenge faced for the development of any pharmacological compound with high molecular weight. Pegylated (polyethylene glycol) immunoliposomes (85 nm size liposomes designed with monoclonal antibodies over its outer surface) were able to support transvascular delivery of plasmid DNA and to target and transduce specific cells in the brain. This group conjugated the PEGylated liposomes with two monoclonal antibodies, one against the mouse transferrin receptor to enable BBB crossing, and the second against the insulin receptor to enhance cellular uptake. The generated PEGylated immunoliposomes encapsidated a plasmid payload that was designed to express the siRNA against the EGF receptor in the transduced cell. The siRNA complex of PEGylated immunoliposomes showed an enhanced antitumor effect by prolonging survival of animals. The ability to treat brain tumors with a systemic approach rather than by stereotactic injection is a major achievement. Recently, it has been reported that recombinant HBV capsids can be used as efficient vehicles for oligonucleotide delivery; they can encapsulate the oligonucleotides in vitro, and mediate their delivery into cells very efficiently. The process is not cell-type-specific. This method may be useful for in vivo systems for HBVinfected individuals or in other diseases provided that the immunogenicity of the viral capsids can be decreased; until then, it can be used in cell culture and in ex vivo systems [138] .",

            "text": "The potential advantage of viral-mediated siRNA delivery encouraged numerous groups to clone expression cassettes in transgenes and to encapsidate these into viral particles. Each type of viral vector holds specific properties. These viral vector characteristics should be those that determine which viral delivery system needs to be applied for the specific therapeutic target. The adenovector [139] , and in particular the Ad-gutless vector, hold major promise for liver-directed systemic delivery. In cases where short-term silencing effect is warranted, the non-gutless vector could then be applied; however, for prolonged silencing effects, the gutless vector might be more beneficial. In the gutless vector, there are practically no restrictions as to the size of the sequences to be incorporated and these could include marker genes, regulatory controlled cassettes or matrix-controlled regions for prolonged expression. Controlling the expression of an siRNA, specifically in tumor cells, could also be designed in a conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd). CRAds are designed to replicate and specifically kill tumor cells without harming normal cells. Carette et al. [140] applied CRAd, which is dependent on Rb deficiency for replication, to test its potential in silencing expression by shRNAs, a marker gene in vitro in tumor cells. They showed that the silencing effect of a marker gene is dependent on CRAd replication. The combination of the CRAd antitumor effect with a siRNA against a tumor-dependent growth gene should be assessed in the future; this possibility was not considered by this group, whether in vitro or in vivo. These issues would need further studies in an effort to assess and enhance their therapeutic potential.",

            "text": "The major advantage of the retroviral delivery method is the potential to incorporate the payload transgene they 'carry' into the host cell genome. The integration site could not be specifically targeted and this could cause side effects. Integration that occurs near cellular protooncogenes can lead to their aberrant expression from the viral LTR, or alternatively this could cause the disruption of a tumor suppresser gene expression. In the past 2 years, numerous groups have reported on various retroviral deliveries [141] , including lentiviral systems to express siRNAs against viral pathogens and tumor cells. Ralf Bartenschlager and associates reported the use of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV)-based vector (pBABE) as a delivery system for siRNA targeting HCV [22] . In their publication, they also assessed a unique RNAi approach against HCV infection. This was done in an effort to overcome the low fidelity of the viral polymerase, establishing a state of quasispecies by generating endoribonuclease-prepared siRNA to simultaneously target multiple sites of the viral genome in order to prevent escape. As for the retroviral delivery approach, this group designed their siRNA mainly against the viral IRES sequences. Their readout system to assess the silencing effect involved tissue culture cells transfected with the subgenomic HCV replicon. This replicon harbors the HCV IRES upstream of the luciferase gene and the neomycin resistance region, and an additional non-HCV IRES upstream of the viral non-structural sequences. The presence of the luciferase gene enables the determination of HCV IRES activity in vitro. This system enables the assessment of the effect of siRNA against the HCV IRES as well as against the viral non-structural genome. The siRNA in the retrovirus was expressed from the H1 promoter. They designed numerous siRNAs in the vector and found that a specific region in the HCV IRES, near the beginning of the viral coding nucleotides, was the most sensitive to RNAi effect. Although this is an interesting approach with clearcut results, significant developmental steps and modifications are required in order to translate this modality into the clinical setting. However, the results described in this report again suggest that the RNAi encounters a therapeutic potential for chronic viral infection. Similar observations were reported by other groups ( [18, 24] , see Table 1 ).",

            "text": "Presently, most groups who use retroviral vectors to express siRNA apply lentiviral vectors. However, it must be kept in mind that the clinical experience with this vector is very limited. Numerous papers were recently published describing differently designed lentiviral vectors to meet Copyright [121] or conditioning [142, 143] of siRNA expression. Veerle Baekelandt and associates have designed a study to assess the potential use of lentiviruses in delivering siRNA into brain tissue. In their recent report [144] , they constructed a lentiviral vector with siRNA against the marker gene eGFP. Upon simultaneous administration into the brain tissue by stereotactic injection of the lentivirus expressing the eGFP and the lentiviral vector expressing the siRNA against the same gene, they were able to show almost complete knockdown of eGFP expression. In two additional experiments in which the siRNA lentivirus was administered before or after the marker gene, they were also able to show significant silencing of expression. Interestingly, they claimed, albeit without showing the data, that this effect persisted for 6 months. However, the issue of delivery is again a major barrier. Stereotactic administrations are possible, but alternative approaches of systemic delivery or intra-organ spreading of the vector would be beneficial. Lentiviruses hold major promise in gene therapy. Once the issue of integration and production is overcome, we expect that the lentiviralbased vector will be integrated into the clinical setting. The AAV vector is currently perceived as a relatively safe vector since it supports long-term expression in most tissues from an episome. Beverly Davidson and associates reported an interesting study on the suppression of polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1), a disease of the polyglutamine-expansion group which also includes Huntington chorea [145] . They expressed the siRNA under a modified CMV promoter due to its enhanced expression/silencing effect compared to the pol III promoter, in their hands. In addition, they revealed that incorporating the miR23 loop (10-nt loop sequence) into the siRNA expression cassette enhanced the silencing effect, resulting in improved suppression of the ataxin protein levels [118] . However, this effect was only apparent in the pol III expression vector. How to select the best loop in any specific case is still an open question, and, presently, this is a matter of empiric assessment. In their mouse model, they injected the AAV vector expressing the shRNA against the mutant SCA1 message directly into the brain tissue. This treatment showed longterm therapeutic effect on motor coordination as well as a histological improvement by reducing intranuclear inclusions. Although this represents a step forward from previous studies with similar models that used antisense and ribozymes as therapeutic agents, we are still far from the clinic. The direct administration of a viral vector into brain tissue is a significant drawback for the current delivery systems. The potential side effects of AAV administration into the brain may soon be revealed once results of clinical studies using the AAV for direct brain administration in Parkinson and Alzheimer disease studies are available [146] . One specific point of importance should be mentioned on the issue of designing loop sequences stated previously. A number of investigators have assessed this matter as related to the effectiveness of silencing. We must bear in mind that for each specific case, there is a need to develop a specific structure to improve the silencing effect [147] .",

            "text": "The jury is still out as to when an antisense approach should be adopted against viral infections or when an si/shRNA strategy should be applied. Although antisense oligos were discovered more than 25 years ago [148] their role as antiviral tools in the clinic is still in progress. Early studies with antisense oligos have shown promising antiviral potency. However, later reports determined that such approaches encounter significant problems. Although comprehensive stringent comparison studies in vitro and in vivo between antisense oligos and siRNA were not performed, we would like to stress a few practical points which characterize each group of compounds, in particular those which are important for those investigators interested in designing an antiviral strategy. Antisense oligos with a high phosphorothioate content, which are early-generation antisense, interact directly and non-specifically with proteins, potentially interfering with their function [149] . However, recently developed 2nd and 3rd generation RNAs -like oligos -have improved significantly the binding affinities of antisense oligos, as well as their nuclease and non-specific proteinbinding characteristics. The new generations include 2 -O-methyl (2OM) and the additional version 2 -Omethoxyethyl (2OME), both encountering improved nuclease resistance, binding affinity and reduced nonspecific binding affinity. Recently, additional novel chemically modified versions of antisense oligos were developed including the locked nucleic acids (LNA) [150] , anhydrohexitol nucleic acids (HNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), morpholino nucleic acids (MNAs), and other uncharged oligos. All these novel chemicals have been tested and proven to hold significant antisense properties, with antiviral effects in models in vitro and in vivo. Their effects are due to the high binding affinity and nuclease degradation resistance, without significant RNaseH activity. To overcome this hurdle, a chimeric version of oligos was generated, the gapmers, containing a core region of a phosphodiester/phosphorothioate flanked on both sides with modified oligo backbones. These gapmers also hold the RNaseH activity of traditional antisenses. When designing any specific experiment aimed to assess an antisense effect, it is important to select the best fitted oligo by testing 10 to 20 different sequences, and compare the selected oligo with appropriate controls containing scrambled, mismatched and irrelevant antisense oligos.",

(2) For chronic viral disease targets, a preferred treatment would be such that continuously generates an antiviral drug. This could include an expression vector for any type of nucleicacid-based drug, including antisense, ribozyme or shRNA.",

The need for repeated administration might be simple even in chronic disease states in cases of accessible organs. (4) For chronic multiorgan, or internal organ, involved in viral infections, e.g., chronic viral hepatitis B or C, intracellular continuous expression of high-level non-toxic, effective therapy is desirable. In this case, an expression system delivered into infected cells is warranted. Designed shRNA based on up-to-date criteria of shRNA [151] [152] [153] might be the preferred gene therapy based treatment. (5) Special attention must be given as to the specific type of virus to be targeted; whether a DNA or a RNA agent. Furthermore, it is important to know where, inside the cellular compartments, should the RNA-based drug be concentrated, e.g., cytoplasmatic vs. nuclear. For RNA viruses, such as HCV, which replicate in the cytoplasm, an antisense approach could be suggested, although it should be kept in mind that the RNaseH effect is preferentially restricted to the nuclear compartment of the cell. However, for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, in which there is a nuclear reservoir of the virus in the form of super-coiled species, a vector which will express its shRNA payload in the nuclear compartment is preferred. Numerous new expression systems were recently suggested to encounter improved silencing properties [147] . Most of these methods are waiting to be assessed as for their truly beneficial properties as antiviral reagents.",
