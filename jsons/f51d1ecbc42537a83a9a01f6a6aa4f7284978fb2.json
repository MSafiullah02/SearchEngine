Exposures to patients with respiratory illness were not associated with infection (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7e1.2); however, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact did have higher odds (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 e1.6). The aORs for exposure and for direct patient contact were similar for illnesses caused by influenza. Conclusion: Community and co-worker contacts are important sources of viral respiratory illness in healthcare personnel, while exposure to patients with recognized respiratory infections is not associated. The comparatively low risk associated with direct patient contact may reflect transmission related to asymptomatic patients or unrecognized infections.",

Aim: To investigate the association between laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections and potential sources of exposure during the previous 7 days. Methods: In this nested caseecontrol analysis, healthcare personnel from nine Canadian hospitals who developed acute respiratory illnesses during the winters of 2010/11e2013/ 14 submitted swabs that were tested for viral pathogens. Associated illness diaries and the weekly diaries of non-ill participants provided information on contact with people displaying symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous week. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association between cases, who were matched by study week and site with controls with no respiratory symptoms. Findings: There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures Introduction Acute respiratory tract infections are among the most commonly experienced illnesses worldwide and cause an estimated 4 million deaths annually [1] . Upper respiratory tract infections are almost exclusively caused by viruses [2, 3] whose transmission persists in healthcare facilities despite current infection control practices. The contagiousness and short incubation time of these viruses promote outbreaks in healthcare facilities [4e6] where they can cause serious illness in vulnerable patients [7e10] .",

Participants were workers aged 18e69 years who worked >20 h/week at one of nine Canadian acute care hospitals: six in Toronto, two in Halifax and one in Hamilton. Participants could enrol for one or multiple seasons. The sample size was estimated to detect a two-fold difference in the likelihood of healthcare personnel developing influenza based on their work area. Seasons were defined as beginning the earlier of the first Monday following 1 st November or the beginning of influenza activity (!5% of specimens submitted to regional reference laboratories testing positive for influenza), and ending whichever was the later of the Monday following 30 th April or 2 weeks after the end of the influenza season (<3% of specimens testing positive for 2 consecutive weeks). The study was approved by the research ethics boards of all participating hospitals and was conducted according to good clinical practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki (2013).",

Throughout the season, they received weekly e-mails with a link to report the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms or illness. Each week, 20% of participants with no illness diary for the previous week answered additional questions about contact with people with symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous 7 days. Just prior to the first weekly e-mail of each season, participants were selected at random into five groups, with each group answering the additional questions every fifth week to reduce participant burden while providing a sufficiently large sample size to conduct analyses. Participants were asked to complete daily symptom diaries when ill and to submit a self-collected mid-turbinate swab if they developed one or more symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness (any one of cough, stuffy or runny nose, sore throat), a fever or felt generally unwell. The first day illness diary included the same questions about contact with symptomatic persons as the weekly diary assigned to 20% of participants. All questionnaires were pilot tested prior to their use in the 2009/10 influenza season [11] , with slight adaptations made, as needed, prior to use in this study. Swabs were tested for respiratory viruses (influenza A or B, parainfluenza viruses 1e4, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, human coronaviruses OC43/HKU1 and 229E/NL63, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus and adenovirus) using the Seeplex RV15 respiratory panel (Seegene Technologies, Seoul, South Korea).",

In contrast, exposure to a patient with acute respiratory illness was not associated with increased odds of an infection. The same results occurred when the outcome was restricted to healthcare personnel who became ill with influenza. The present data regarding exposure risk in households are compatible with the results of three studies of influenza during the 2009 influenza pandemic and one small study of respiratory illness in an intensive care unit setting during the 2008/09 winter season [11, 12, 14, 15] . All of these studies identified the exposure of healthcare personnel to household contacts as having the highest odds of respiratory illness after exposure, with ORs ranging from 2.9 to 16.7. These data are also supported by several studies documenting that the number of children in a household is a risk for influenza in adults, which is to be expected since the seasonal attack rate for influenza in children is higher than that for adults [13, 16, 25] .",

Some of these differences may be due to study methods. For instance, Choi et al.'s study was a retrospective questionnaire administered more than 1 year after the first wave of the pandemic, and illness in colleagues may have been under-reported. Other disparities may be due to true differences in hospital design or infection prevention practices. Another issue is the attribution of exposure sources. In some studies, multiple contacts were attributed to only one source e patients in some instances e while other studies failed to assess the impact of community contacts [17, 20, 27] . Future transmission of viral respiratory infection studies in healthcare personnel need to assess the impact of a variety of potential sources including patients, co-workers, household, non-household (social/community) and contemporaneous (i.e. non-attributable) exposures.",

            "text": "These data confirm the findings of other studies that most viral respiratory illnesses in healthcare personnel occur as a result of exposure at home rather than occupational exposure [11e15] . In this cohort, only 9e13% of viral illnesses were probably or possibly associated with exposure to a symptomatic patient. The facts that over 35% of viral infections had no known exposure, that HCPs with direct patient contact were more likely to develop infection, and that recognized exposure to patients with acute respiratory illness was not a risk, suggest that exposure to undetected and unsuspected viral respiratory illness may be a greater risk to healthcare providers than exposure to identified patients. This is not surprising given the evidence that influenza infection in the frail elderly often presents atypically [28, 29] , and that a non-trivial percentage of influenza infections are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic [30, 31] . The present findings also suggest that isolating and measuring the risk to healthcare personnel from recognized patients with viral illness is difficult; the findings in different studies that healthcare personnel wearing different types of protective equipment have similar rates of viral infection may be because most infections are a result of non-occupational exposures or exposures to patients not recognized as ill, rather than because the different types of protective equipment provide similar levels of protection [32, 33] .",

However, several other studies, including those summarized in at least three systematic reviews, provide evidence that personal protective equipment reduces the risk of transmission of infection [34e36] . The present results may be due to a lack of power or could be explained by differences in reported and actual behaviour, misuse of protective equipment and/or transmission from non-patient sources. Jessee and Mion report that nurses' self-reported adherence to precautions was significantly higher than observed behaviour, reflecting high levels of knowledge about precautions but also social desirability bias in answering survey questions [37] . Although some healthcare personnel may disregard or fail to recall recommended precautions (approximately 11% of healthcare personnel in this study reported limited use of protective equipment when caring for patients with a febrile respiratory illness), Krein et al. report that many healthcare personnel in their study made inadvertent mistakes when using protective equipment, putting themselves at risk of exposure [38] .",

This finding is consistent with several recent publications in which influenza vaccination was confirmed to be protective against laboratory-confirmed influenza for healthcare personnel [39e41], and reinforces the benefits of ongoing vaccination programmes in healthcare facilities. In this cohort, household members, social contacts and coworkers represent approximately 80% of the known sources associated with influenza while exposure to patients represents the other 20%. These findings highlight the importance of vaccination programmes to protect vulnerable patients from influenza transmission via their healthcare provider.",

The prospective nature of the study and the completion of illness diaries at the time of swab collection (prior to the results being known) reduced the likelihood that cases biased their recall regarding who they were exposed to.

Given that 95% of healthcare personnel in this cohort attended work while symptomatic with an acute respiratory illness [22] , the potential for worker-to-worker and/or healthcare worker-topatient transmission is high. Providing care to patients with undetected viral respiratory infection may explain why reported exposure to patients with an acute respiratory illness was not a risk factor for infection while having physical contact with patients was a risk factor.",
