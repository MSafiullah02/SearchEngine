Since then, a novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has spread around the world, and the number of infected patients has been growing exponentially. We have known that the novel coronavirus has certain infectivity and a good affinity with human respiratory tract cells. It can also be transmitted from person to person. Thus, it is useful and urgent to predict the situation of this outbreak with mathematical modeling. Besides, students still stay at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

SEIJR The SEIJR model is roughly the same as traditional SEIR model, but the population is divided into susceptible individuals, asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period, infectious individuals with symptoms, isolated individuals with treatment, and recovered individuals. Read et al. [5] adopted this idea. This model accurately separates isolated and other populations and it is more realistic about the status quo.
