Objectives and study design: The performance of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) and Verigene RV+ (RV+) were compared in a retrospective analysis of 89 clinical specimens previously determined to be positive for the following viruses by our test of record, Prodesse (Pro): influenza A (29, FluA), influenza B (13, FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (12, RSV), human metapneumovirus (10, hMPV), parainfluenza (14, PIV), and adenovirus (10, AdV). Samples positive for influenza A, B or RSV were tested by both methods, while the remainder were tested by RP only. True positives were defined as positive by two or more assays. Results: Limit of detection (LOD) analyses demonstrated Pro had the lowest LOD for all FluA strains tested, PIV1, PIV2 and AdV; RV+ had the lowest LOD for FluB; and RP had the lowest LOD for RSV, PIV3 and hMPV. Of the 55 samples tested by RV+, all 54 true positive samples were positive by RV+. Of the 89 samples tested by RP, 85 of the 88 true positive samples were positive by RP. From these results, the overall sensitivities for influenza A, B and RSV were 100% and 98% for RV+ and RP, respectively. The overall sensitivity of RP for all viruses was 97%.

One potential reason for the discrepancy between studies is that all specimens in the Belgium study were collected between February and March 2012 and almost all FluA specimens subtyped as sH3. Hence, RV+ may perform suboptimally with the strain of sH3 circulating in Belgium during the winter of 2012.

However, false positive results were seen with both RP and RV+. It is possible that the false positive results were an artifact of testing samples in pools. Contamination is another possible source for false positive results. RP is a closed, real-time PCR; hence there is no opportunity for contamination with residual amplicon.
