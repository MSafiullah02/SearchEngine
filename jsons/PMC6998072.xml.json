            "text": "Targeting optimal nutrition concerning energy goals is essential in critically ill patients, as both underfeeding and overfeeding have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality [1]. Ideally, the target is based on energy expenditure (EE). However, due to the pathophysiological response to critical illness, iatrogenic interventions, and differences in body composition, EE is highly variable in and between critically ill patients [2]. Frequent monitoring of EE may circumvent this problem and help to adjust the optimal amount of calories on an individual basis. At present, indirect calorimetry is considered the gold standard. However, frequently, this technique is not available and often unfeasible [3].",

The mechanical ventilator measured the VCO2 (Hamilton-S1, Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), and every minute, data are automatically sent to our electronic patient data management system (MetaVision; iMDsoft MetaVision\u00ae, Tel Aviv, Israel). For each patient, the VCO2 was collected during the 12 h before and during the 12 h after the start of cisatracurium infusion. When patients were not admitted to the ICU 12 h before the start of cisatracurium infusion, the parameters of the available hours were used. The EEVCO2 was calculated every 2 h using the mean VCO2 measurements from the previous 2 h.",

Before we designed the study, we expected, due to the drop in EE induced by the NMBA, that some of the patients would be overfed. Based on the results, we noticed that a reduction of EE by NMBA could induce an almost 10% overfeeding risk in individual patients. In daily practice, this did not occur as the patients were not on nutrition target. Thus, for most patients, adjustment may not be necessary as in our analysis the reduction of EE found was only 6.6% and hypercaloric feeding was only present in 5.7%, while most other patients were fed (77.9%) hypocalorically after initiation of cisatracurium infusion.",
