Sophisticated simulations presented in their article guide optimal staffing in intensive care units. While conventional staffing allocations do not keep a cohort protected, staffing aligned with the pandemic's epidemiology does. We have considered a similar method to one the authors' advocate.",

While literally getting-in-touch is a caring physician's \"first language,\" 3 the interactions with our patients now through masks and with PPE create barriers which are new to them and to us. We can no longer lunch with colleagues, gather in groups, or have collective conferences. There is a heightened anxiety for both our personal welfare and the people with whom we work and the concern we might bring infections back to our families.",

Our department has created a buddy system with daily check-ins. The chairs with whom I speak maintain as \"normal\" an atmosphere within the department as possible and send communication updates to keep everyone informed of the latest pertinent news. People have only so much psychic energy, and it is important to allow them to focus on the critical tasks at hand and to minimize extraneous duties. 6 We must calculate the COVID-19 equation with the people's energy as key variable in mind!
