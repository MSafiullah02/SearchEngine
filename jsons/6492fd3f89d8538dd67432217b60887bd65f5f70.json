By following a strict screening protocol based on clinical assessment, chest CT and RT-PCR, one SARS-CoV-2 positive patient could be identified, and surgery was postponed. The other thirty patients underwent successful surgery and no occurrence of COVID-19 nor COVID-19-related morbidity were noted. The screening and organizational strategy outlined in this study was applicable to both emergency and elective oncological surgery. The number of hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2 in France increased 3-fold during March 2020, putting hospitals under great pressure. Given that Croix Rousse University Hospital is the referral hospital in a region with one of the highest numbers of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in France, rapid measures to reorganize surgical care had to be taken. The cornerstone of this strategy consisted in a systematic screening for SARS-CoV-2 prior to surgery. The incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 is 5 days (4.5-5.8) and the majority of infected patients only develop symptoms within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days).(3) In this context, preoperative identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients by symptoms only seems insufficient to prevent contamination of hospital staff and reduce individual patient risk. While there are no clear recommendations on preoperative screening, we implemented a broad and systematic preoperative screening, based on a combination of patient history, chest CT and RT-PCR.",
