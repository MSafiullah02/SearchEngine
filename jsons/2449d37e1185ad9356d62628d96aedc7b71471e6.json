A key question for future research is how SOFA and comorbidity scores correlate with long-term outcomes. However, we have identified important limitations of several representative state triage algorithms and provided a framework for future quantitative analyses. The ethical defensibility of these algorithms will depend, in part, on empirical analyses of how they function in practice. Table 1 demonstrates the percentage of times across all pairs that each algorithm chose a patient with the \"better outcome,\" chose a patient with a \"worse outcome,\" chose a patient but both had \"equal outcomes,\" and for when the algorithm did not make a choice, which would require going to lottery. New York guidelines and Alternative Models did not have age-based tie-breakers, and thus all ties went directly to lottery. NY guidelines for SOFA score calculations do not include mechanical ventilation in the P:F ratio score definition. c SOFA scores and age were poorly correlated (r s = 0.123, p = 0.543).",
