Tyrosinase is the essential and rate-limiting enzyme for melanin production, that strictly requires neutral pH for activity. pH maintenance is a result of the combinational function of multiple ion transport proteins. Thus, ion homeostasis in melanosomes is crucial for melanin synthesis. Defect of the ion transport system causes various pigmentation phenotypes, from mild effect to severe disorders such as albinism. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date knowledge of the ion transport system, such as transport function, structure, and the physiological roles and mechanisms of the ion transport proteins in melanosomes. In addition, we propose a model of melanosomal ion transport system-how the functional coupling of multiple transport proteins modulates and maintains ion homeostasis. We discuss melanin synthesis in terms of the ion transport system.",

Melanosomes are responsible for synthesis, storage, and transport of melanin. The main roles of melanin are pigmentation (skin, hair and eye color) and defense mechanism against ultraviolet radiation and mechano-stress [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Unlike retinal epithelial cells where melanosomes are matured and the pigment is settled during development, melanocytes in skin and hair continuously produce melanosomes throughout life [1] . Originating from endosomes, melanosome is a member of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) and shares some characteristics and pathways with those of lysosome; similarities include biogenesis, maturation, trafficking (exo/endocytosis), recycling and migration [6, 7] . However, melanosome biogenesis exhibits unique processes and specifically takes place in melanocytes. Newly mature melanosomes migrate from melanocytes to keratinocytes, resulting in pigmentation of epithelial cells (Fig. 1) [1, 6, 8] . As there are multiple processes, several protein molecules are involved in melanosome biogenesis, trafficking, and migration. Alterations of each corresponding molecule undoubtedly contribute to the variation of skin and eye color as well as ocular and dermatological diseases such as retinal pigment epitheliopathy, albinism, hyperpigmentation disorders, and skin cancers [4, 9, 10] .",

Some of these membrane transport proteins including OCA2 (oculocutaneous II), SLC45A2 (solute carrier 45 member 2), SLC24A5 (solute carrier 24 member 5), TPC2 (two-pore channel protein 2) and ATP7A (copper-transporting ATPase 1) have been predicted to modulate melanosomal pH and contribute to the activity of tyrosinase (TYR), an essential protein for melanin production [11] . Previous studies indicated that mutations and polymorphisms of these transport proteins are strongly associated with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) [4] . Until present, several causative mutations have been identified. However, the roles or transport functions of the transport proteins in melanogenesis are still poorly understood. In this review, we highlight the current progress of the research of membrane transport proteins in melanosomes and melanogenesis. Specifically, transport function, roles in melanogenesis, and significant causative mutation are summarized here. Furthermore, we predict 3D structures of the transport proteins and discuss the unknown functions of these membrane transport proteins in melanosomes.",

Melanin has a broad absorption spectrum and a high optical refractive index, enabling intriguing biological properties; such as UV light absorption and scattering, free radical scavenging, ion storage, metal chelation, and electromagnetic field sensing [2, 5, 12] . Animals have two major types of melanin: brown-black eumelanin and redyellow pheomelanin. While eumelanin in the skin is the major factor contributing to skin color (dark or light skins), the ratio of eumelanin and pheomelanin in the hair determines diverse shades of hair color. Because both types of melanin have distinct chemical structures and optical properties, the response to UV radiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are different. Pheomelanin is less protective against UV radiation and ROS than eumelanin, leading to UV-radiation-dependent melanoma risk [2, 13] . In addition, the intrinsic pheomelanin synthesis pathway produces UV-radiation-independent contributors to melanomagenesis [14] . Consequently, people who have red hair/fair skin (phenotypes of low eumelanin) are at greater risk for skin cancer.",

TYR also oxidizes L-DOPA into dopaquinone. Depending on the availability of L-cysteine and the function of downstream enzymes, different types of melanin are produced. The eumelanin synthesis pathway is quite well studied compared to the pheomelanin synthesis pathway. The production of eumelanin occurs in the absence of L-cysteine. Dopaquinone is converted into two intermediates: 5,6-dihydroxylindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and 5,6-dihydroxyl indole (DHI), then finally converted to eumelanin. These processes require enzymatic reactions of TYR and two other enzymes, dopachrome tautomerase (DCT/TYRP2/TRP2) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1/TRP1). In the presence of L-cysteine, dopaquinone is converted into cysteinylDOPA instead. The cy-steinylDOPA passes several enzymatic reactions involving oxidation and polymerization yielding pheomelanin (Fig. 2) [4, 15, 16] .",

MC1R is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) on melanocytes that Melanocytes and keratinocytes are cells located in epidermis layers (left). Melanogenesis takes place in melanosome, a unique organelle in melanocytes. Melanosome is developed from the early endosome. Melanosome formation and maturation are called biogenesis, which is composed of four stages. Stages I-II are the nonpigmented stages of melanosomes, called premelanosomes. In premelanosomes, PMEL fibrils are formed (stage I), and completely organized as parallel sheets in ellipsoidal shape (stage II). Melanogenesis pathway begins at stage III, the stage which TYR along with TYRPs, ATP7A, OCA2, SLC45A2, and TPC2 are translocated from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes. The premelanosomes have acidic pH, but stages III-IV melanosomes have neutral pH, which may be a result of combinational function of the newly deposited ion transport proteins. Under neutral pH, TYR is functional and melanin is synthesized. Synthesized melanins fully mask on PMEL fibrils at stage IV, resulting in mature melanosome. Mature melanosomes are delivered to keratinocytes and are distributed throughout the skin. In melanin production, tyrosinase (TYR) is a rate-limiting enzyme that converts L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, and subsequently, to dopaquinone. In the absence of Lcysteine, dopaquinone is finally converted to eumelanin. TYRP1 and TYRP2 (DCT) are tyrosinase-related proteins that contribute to the processes of eumelanin synthesis. Pheomelanin is synthesized under the presence of L-cysteine via several precursors.",

Functional control of TYR protein is accomplished by modulation of melanosomal pH because TYR activity is solely dependent on pH. Neutral pH preserves TYR and TYRPs functions, while acidic pH suppresses TYR function without altering its expression (discussed in later section).

            "text": "Both melanosomes and lysosomes originate from multivesicular endosomes. However, melanosome formation occurs through distinct pathways in melanocytes in which several unique proteins are involved [7, 11, 20] . Melanosome biogenesis (referred to eumelanosome biogenesis), the process of melanosome development and maturation, is composed of four different stages (Fig. 1 ). Melanosomes at stages I-II, also called premelanosomes, lack melanin production but contain the formation of amyloid fibrils composed of the melanocyte protein PMEL (also known as PMEL17 and gp100). The characteristic of melanosomes at stage I is similar to the early endosome, which contains intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). In this stage, PMEL is cleaved into M\u03b1 and M\u03b2 fragments. The M\u03b1 fragments dissociate from the luminal domain and start to nucleate at the ILVs to form tiny non-rearranged fibrils. During stage II, the formation of the fibrils, called PMEL fibrils, is completed. PMEL fibrils are organized and elongated as arrays of parallel sheets in an ellipsoidal shape of melanosome, serving as a matrix for melanin deposition which is initiated at stage III and completed at stage IV ( Fig. 1 ) [7, 21] . At stage III, several enzymes (TYR, TYRP1 and TYRP2) and ion transport proteins (ATP7A, OCA2, SLC45A2 and TPC2) for melanogenesis are sorted from trans-Golgi network to melanosome, and then, melanogenesis begins [11, 20, 22, 23] . Synthesized melanin moves on and covers the PMEL fibrils completely at stage III and thickens and darkens as shown at stage IV. In skin, the mature melanosomes enter the process of migration from melanocytes to keratinocytes resulting in the spread of skin colors [1, 5, 6, 8] . In hair follicles, stages of melanosome biogenesis, melanogenesis and melanosome transfer are similar to those of melanocytes in epidermis. Melanosome biogenesis occurs in follicular melanocytes located in hair bulbs during the anagen stage of hair cycle. Due to the distinct anatomic compartments, follicular melanocytes have more dendritic, extensive Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and produce larger mature melanosomes than epidermal melanocytes [24] .",

Secondary active transport proteins utilize energy from the electrochemical gradients, such as Na + , to drive the active transport. Tertiary active transport proteins mediate exchange or cotransport by using the energy derived from the chemical gradients generated by the secondary active transport proteins [25] . The maintenance of ion homeostasis requires the combinational function of ion transport proteins. In melanosomes, ions are indispensable factors that define the nature of the organelle for melanogenesis as well as its biogenesis.

The importance of other ions, Na + , K + , and Cl \u2212 in melanogenesis, has not been directly revealed. However, two aspects are proposed below. The first aspect is based on the physiological function of Na + and K + for maintenance of membrane potential. The K + concentration gradient determines membrane potential and Na + is required during polarization/depolarization. Therefore, Na + and K + may contribute to the maintenance of membrane potential in melanosomes. Cl \u2212 and Ca 2+ may also be involved in maintaining the membrane potential. The second aspect is that Na + , Ca 2+ , and Cl \u2212 are coupled substrates of ion transport proteins which are important for modulation of melanosomal pH during stages III-IV. The pH maintenance requires the functional combination of multiple ion transport proteins such as OCA2, SLC45A2, and TPC2. OCA2 mediates Cl \u2212 conductance and TPC2 shows the properties of Na + and/or Ca 2+ efflux (see in later section). Thus, it is highly possible that Na + , Ca 2+ and Cl \u2212 participate in the pH maintenance of melanosomes.",

Premelanosomes exhibit acidic pH while stages III-IV melanosomes show neutral pH. PMEL fibrils are rapidly formed under strict acidic condition of premelanosomes [26, 27] . However, TYR and TYRPs, which are expressed in stages III-IV melanosomes, are active at neutral pH and have diminished activity in acidic conditions [28] [29] [30] [31] . Neutral pH promotes eumelanin synthesis by maintaining the full activity of TYR as observed in melanosomes of the melanocytes from Black skin. In contrast, melanosomes of melanocytes from Caucasians are more acidic, and their TYR is largely inactive. Rescue experiments using NH 4 Cl to increase melanosomal pH confirmed the importance of pH in TYR activity. Caucasian melanocytes treated with NH 4 Cl show an increase of TYR activity whereas Black melanocytes do not change the TYR activity with NH 4 Cl treatment [30] . Acidification also suppresses the eumelanin synthesis at the later steps after dopachrome (Fig. 2 ) [31] . Moreover, weak acidic pH promotes the pheomelanin production pathway [32] . These results demonstrate that during melanosome maturation at stages II-III the melanosomal pH changes from acidic to neutral thereby terminating PMEL polymerization steps and, instead, initiating TYR function.",

SLC45A2 belongs to the H + /sugar cotransporter family [36] . Knockdown of SLC45A2 results in melanosomal acidification, which interrupts TYR activity in the cell models [37] . In albino zebrafish with a SLC45A2 mutation, the TYR activity is disrupted, but rescued by reinjection of SLC45A2 mRNA or bafilomycin treatment [35] . Although SLC45A2 transport activity in melanosomes is unclear, it is proposed that SLC45A2 effluxes H + coupled with substrates and neutralizes the pH of stages III-IV melanosomes (Fig. 3) . Additionally, voltage-gated Cl \u2212 /H + exchangers (ClCs) and Na + /H + exchangers (NHEs) may be candidates participating in H + export. ClC-7 mediates H + efflux in lysosome to control lysosomal pH. Mutation in ClC-7 gene causes hyperacidification and results in albinism [38] . Thus, it is possible that ClC-7 is also expressed in melanosomes. NHE3 and NHE7 are colocalized with TYRP1 in melanocytes, although the function of NHEs in melanosomes has not yet been demonstrated [39] .",

TYR contains two Cu 2+ binding sites, and TYRPs hold two Zn 2+ binding sites [15, 16] . The requirement of Cu 2+ ions for TYR has been clearly demonstrated. Binding of two Cu 2+ ions and an oxygen molecule in TYR enables the redox properties on oxidation states of monooxygenase and oxidase activities [15] . While TYR requires Cu 2+ , TYRP2 tautomerase activity requires Zn 2+ [42] . The binding of metal ions to TYRP1 is still controversial. TYRP1 contains Zn 2+ binding sites but biochemical experiments have failed to prove the direct binding of Zn 2+ [43] .

Albinism is a congenital disorder defined by a lack of pigmentation (both complete and partial). Two groups of albinism, oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and ocular albinism (OA), are classified based on the diagnostic phenotypes. OCA, the most common group, describes the abnormal V-ATPase, a H + pump, is expressed since stage I premelanosomes, generating acidic pH in premelanosomes. TYR along with other ion transport proteins are expressed in stages III-IV melanosomes. ATP7A is a Cu 2+ pump, supplying Cu 2+ as a cofactor for TYR. OCA2 and SLC45A2 are positive regulators for TYR function (black dash arrows) while TPC2 is negative regulator (black dash line with blunt end). Transport properties and substrates of OCA2, SLC45A2 and TPC2 are proposed. Combinational function of these proteins is suggested to switches acidic pH into neutral pH (orange dash lines), which corresponds to the termination of stage II and initiation of stage III melanosomes. pH neutralization serves as the optimal environmental platform for TYR function, leading to melanin production during stages III-IV melanosomes (orange arrow).",

Type II, IV and VI OCA are caused by mutations of ion transport proteins OCA2, SLC45A2, and SLC24A5, respectively ( Table 1 ). The defect of ATP7A does not cause albinism but causes Menkes disease. Symptoms of the Menkes patients vary but include abnormalities in hair and skin [62] .

At the same time, Ramsay et al. identified the loci at the close region of P locus as the associated loci for type II OCA [66] . Later, the two loci were verified to be the same gene named OCA2/P, which is also typically related to Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome, a disorder resulting from partial deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 [67] . OCA2 (838 amino acid residues) is predicted to contain 12 transmembrane domains [40, 67] . OCA2 mRNA is expressed in the eyes, skin, and brain (The Human Protein Atlas project: http://www.proteinatlas.org, last update March 2020). At subcellular localization, OCA2 protein is specifically expressed in mature (stages III-IV) melanosomes [68] . Like TYR and TYRPs, OCA2 contains an acidic dileucine motif and colocalizes with BLOC-1 (a cargo-specific sorting protein for TYRP1) for sorting from Golgi apparatus to early endosomes and targets to melanosomes [23] .",

The pH regulation by OCA2 targets V-ATPase as observed in the rescue of TYR function after V-ATPase inhibition in OCA2-knockout melanocytes [28, 29, 34, 69, 70] . Besides pH regulation, OCA2 likely facilitates TYR trafficking from ER/Golgi network to melanosomes. The OCA2-knockout melanocytes show some TYR retaining on ER/Golgi network, and the melanosomal re-localization of TYR could be rescued by pH modulation [69] [70] [71] [72] .

OCA2 is a causative gene for type II OCA (MIM#203200), which is the most common type of OCA worldwide. Hundreds of mutations are identified in humans (Albinism Database: http://www.ifpcs.org, last update September 2009; The Human Gene Mutation Database: http://www. hgmd.cf.ac.uk, last update April 2019). The pathogenic phenotypes include hypopigmentation of skin and hair, reduced iris and retinal pigments, and ocular defect (Lewis RA. Gene Reviews, last update August 2012: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1343/). At the cellular level, the patient has small melanocytes, immature melanosomes, and no or little melanin production. Examples of pathogenic mutations are V443I, P743L, and A481T. Patients with V443I and P743L double mutations develop severe phenotypes of type II OCA and Prader-Willi syndrome [76] . A481T, a mutation associated with mildsymptom phenotypes, is commonly found in Caucasians as well as in East Asians [76] [77] [78] . Polymorphisms of OCA2 give rise to diverse variations of eyes, hair, and skin colors such as blue eyes (Table 1) [79, 80] . ",

Based on the current information, SLC45A2 is predicted to efflux H + from melanosomes ( Fig. 3) [36, 37, 85] . If so, the H + efflux by SLC45A2 reduces melanosomal H + concentration driven by V-ATPase, thereby neutralizing the melanosomal pH.

The most frequent mutations are D93N, D157N, and G188V, which result in light/yellow/white/blue hair, blue/red/brown/gray eye color, and some nystagmus. A477V causes leucism in lions and tigers, and the mutation (A477T) has been reported once in humans [90, 91] . We constructed a 3D structure model of the SLC45A2 by using lactose permease (LacY; PDB No. 5GXB) as a template (Fig. 4) [92] . The model contains 12 transmembrane domains (TM) with the conserved structural fold of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Two bundles, (TM 1, 4, 5) and (TM 7, 10, 11) , are arranged in pseudosymmetry and form a presumable substrate binding site, while residues on TM 7, 9 and 10 may be involved in proton coupling and transfer.

The transport function of SLC24A5 activates both melanogenesis and melanosome biogenesis implying ion regulation and Ca 2+ supplementation by SLC24A5 in melanosomes [61, 97] . There are three proposed mechanisms for how SLC24A5 supplies the ions to melanosomes based on its subcellular localization. The first possibility is that SLC24A5 in trans-Golgi network plays a role in pH regulation by functional coupling with NHE7 and V-ATPase. This functional coupling may ensure the TYR maturation and proper trafficking of TYR from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes [97] . Another possibility is based on SLC24A5 localization in melanosomes as mentioned in the previous section; SLC24A5 supplies Ca 2+ to promote PMEL polymerization and maintain Ca 2+ homeostasis as well as membrane potential in melanosomes [94] . The third possibility is derived from the localization of SLC24A5 in mitochondria. SLC24A5 may transfer Ca 2+ from mitochondria to melanosome via \"mitochondrionmelanosome contact\" [61, 101] .",

The voltage sensing domain is from TM1-4 helices. TM5 and TM6 from each set of protomers assemble to form a central ion conduction pore [105] . Unlike TPC1 and TPC3, TPC2 functions as a voltage-independent cation channel, meaning that the channel is opened in response only to the binding of its ligands, independently from membrane potential [105] [106] [107] .

            "text": "The TPC2-regulating pathway in non-pigmented cells has been studied quite intensively, although the recognized ligands and ionic substrates of TPC2 are still controversial. TPC2 is found to be a receptor for either nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or PI (3,5)P 2 or both [108, 109] . Both NAADP and PI(3,5)P 2 are intracellular second messengers in response to various stimuli. NAADP-sensing TPC2 mediates Ca 2+ release in lysosome and endolysosome [58, 59, [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] . PI(3,5)P 2 -dependent TPC activation induces Na + release [105, [115] [116] [117] [118] . Despite the difference of stimuli and responsive ions, most studies demonstrate the common role of TPC2 in lysosomal Structural model of human SLC24A5 is predicted based on the structure of archaebacterial ortholog NCX_Mj; left, side view; right, top view. Seventy amino acid residues at N-terminus and residues 212-314 located between TM 5-6 covering the signaling peptides and f-loop, respectively, are omitted from the modeling for the best fit. The model contains 10 transmembrane domains in which TM1-5 and TM6-10 align in two-fold inverted repeats. Apparent f-loop (dash line) is manually drawn to connect TM5 and TM6. Amino acid sequence alignment of SLC24A1-SLC24A5 and NCX_Mj demonstrated that all ion binding sites in NCX_Mj are conserved among all SLC24 members. The predicted ion binding sites of SLC24A5 are A46, S49, S50 and E53 in TM2; S76, and, N80 in TM3; A204, T207, S208, and D211 in TM7; and S234, and D238 in TM8 (cyan area). Residues corresponding to type VI OCA mutations (A115, R174, and S182) and polymorphisms (A111) are shown in ball-and-stick. All mutation residues locate far away from the putative ion binding site and indeed the phenotypes of type VI OCA is considered as non-severe syndrome. stability and pH maintenance, implying the significance of TPC2 on lysosomal protein functions. Malfunction of TPC2 results in impairment of lysosomal acidification. Upstream molecules that regulate TPC2 are, for example, VEGF, mTOR, p38, and MAPK [113, 119, 120] . TPC2 has a wide effect on cellular activities such as cell invasion, autophagy, muscle contraction, and angiogenesis [112, 118, 119, 121] . Notably, TPC2 is a target for Ebola virus and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infectivity and treatment [122] [123] [124] .",

Studies in melanosomes bring a similar debate to those in non-melanocyte's lysosomes about preferable stimulants and ions of TPC2. By using oocyte and melanocyte models, Lin et al. and Ambrosio et al. showed that TPC2 mediates Ca 2+ release in response to NAADP [41, 60] . Meanwhile, Bellono et al. demonstrated the PI(3,5)P 2 activates TPC2-mediated Na + -selective conductance [126] . The response to PI(3,5)P 2 is further observed in a TPC2-expressing endolysosome models [63] . Nevertheless, loss of TPC2 clearly affects melanosomal pH and size, and melanin production. Likewise, TPC2 plays a role in pH maintenance by acting as a negative regulator for melanin production and pH neutralization (TPC2 promotes acidic pH) [41, 126] . It is postulated that TPC2 generates membrane voltage (membrane potential) by the positive conductance, thus, controlling the function of V-ATPase for H + influx. The combinational function of the negative regulator TPC2 and the positive regulator OCA2 is also proposed to control melanosomal pH [126] . The anion conductance by OCA2 could be counterbalanced with the cation conductance by TPC2 in order to modulate V-ATPase function thereby maintaining ion and pH homeostasis inside the melanosomes (Fig. 3 ).",

ATP7A is a primary active transport protein that utilizes ATP hydrolysis to mediate Cu 2+ transport out of the cytosol. ATP7A is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and plays a central role in controlling Cu 2+ balance in the cells. Cu 2+ is an essential cofactor for enzymatic functions, however, excessive amounts of Cu 2+ lead to tissue toxicity such as liver diseases and neurological defects [62, 127, 128] . Accordingly, cells need to restrict cellular Cu 2+ homeostasis, and thus, ATP7A is critical. ATP7A has dual functions; in non-pigmented cells, ATP7A is trafficked between plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network via exocytosis and endocytosis [129] . Under normal conditions, ATP7A resides in the trans-Golgi network and supplies Cu 2+ to the Cu 2+ -dependent proteins (so called cuproproteins) such as cytochrome C oxidase and superoxide dismutase [130, 131] . In the presence of an exceeding amount of Cu 2+ , ATP7A is translocated to the plasma membrane and transports Cu 2+ out of the cell. When Cu 2+ returns to physiological level, ATP7A is relocated back to trans-Golgi network [128, [132] [133] [134] . At the bloodbrain barrier, ATP7A is trafficked to the basolateral membrane to promote Cu 2+ delivery to the brain. ATP7A plays important roles in neuron activation, angiotensin-II-associated hypertension, cisplatin resistance and hepatic Cu 2+ mobilization [62] .",

The Cu 2+ binding sites are located inside the M domain. All members of copper-ATPases contain N-terminal 6 heavy metal binding domains, which may be involved in autoinhibition and trafficking rather than Cu 2+ transport [135] . Importantly, ATP7A contains a lumenal loop located between MA and MB called HM loop (His-and Met-rich loop) which is absent in ATP7B, another copper-transporting ATPase [135, 136] . HM loop likely mimics the function of metallochaperones by serving itself as a platform for Cu 2+ transferring from ATP7A to cuproproteins directly without specific chaperones. His and Met in HM loop are potential copper ligands, and they undergo His-to-Met ligand switching via His protonation in different pH. This pH-sensitive HM loop thereby accommodates conformational flexibility allowing Cu 2+ transfer to different cuproproteins that exhibit optimal functions at different pH, e.g. metalation to TYR in neutral pH and PHM (peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase) in acidic pH [136] .",

ATP7A is translocated from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes via BLOC-1 containing cargo which also sorts TYRP1 and OCA2 [22] . As described, Cu 2+ is an indispensable cofactor for TYR function. Previous studies demonstrated that TYR exhibits as Cu 2+ -bound form since it is located in trans-Golgi network (prior to translocation to the melanosome), and Cu 2+ is continuously supplied to TYR to ensure TYR function in stages III-IV melanosomes [137] . Setty et al. confirmed that melanosomal ATP7A transports Cu 2+ from cytosol to the lumen, thereby supplying Cu 2+ to TYR during melanosome maturation (Fig. 3 ) [22] . One question remains to be addressed: how does TYR get Cu 2+ loading during its localization in trans-Golgi network? ATP7A may be involved in this action as well because ATP7A and TYR coexist in the trans-Golgi network. Additionally, ATP7A is active in broad-range pH due to its H + -controlling switch in HM loop [136] . Taken together, ATP7A may be functional to continuously supply Cu 2+ to TYR at both trans-Golgi networks and melanosomes.",

TYR function is solely dependent on neutral pH and the existence of Cu 2+ as a cofactor. All ion transport proteins play significant roles in this respect. ATP7A simply transports Cu 2+ to supply Cu 2+ to TYR. OCA2, SLC45A2 and TPC2 (perhaps also SLC24A5) are important for pH maintenance. Although the mechanism of pH regulation remains unclear, the goal of the transport proteins is simple-to change the acidic pH in premelanosomes to neutral pH in stages III-IV melanosomes. To modulate pH, OCA2, SLC45A2, and TPC2 likely need to function together in a so called \"combinational function of ion transport proteins\". Based on the present information, we propose the model of combinational function of ion transport proteins for the pH maintenance in stages III-IV melanosomes (Fig. 3) .",

To elucidate the combinational function of multiple ion transport proteins, understanding of the functional properties of each transport protein is crucial. Therefore, further characterization of the transport proteins is a must. Comprehensive studies of proteinprotein interactions by mass spectrometry, so-called interactomics, will explain the combinational function of the ion transport proteins. Future genomic and transcriptomic studies may identify more gene candidates and fill the remaining pieces of the Jigsaw puzzle in melanogenesis. The latest advance in structure biology will give us structural information of the ion transport proteins in detail, which may suggest the transport mechanism of proteins. Most importantly, although it is not easy to dissect transport functions of organellar transport proteins, the transport function of the ion transporters can be revealed by using a classical biochemical method, the cell-free transport assay with proteoliposomes, purified protein-reconstituted liposomes as shown by Moriyama or others [141, 142] . Recently, MFSD12 (major facilitator superfamily domain containing protein 12) was identified as an associated gene in pigmentation in African population by GWAS [143, 144] . In addition to the ion transport proteins we described above, MFSD12 requires characterization of its function and role in melanocytes. The melanosomal transport proteins provide a large number of open questions to us.",
