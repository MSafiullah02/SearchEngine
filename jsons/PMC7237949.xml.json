As in other countries, number of cases increased over time in correlation with the increasing number of testing as well as spread of the virus and as of April 30, 2020 there were 120,204 confirmed cases in Turkey, which ranked as 7th after Germany. On April 11, 2020 almost 4 weeks after the first case, Turkey reported highest number of new cases per day and since than numbers for daily new cases started to decrease.2 Unlike many other European countries, there was no nationwide lockdown in Turkey and only certain age groups (\u226420 and \u226565 years of age) are exposed to lockdown measures.",

In this report, we wanted to investigate the early impact of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical urologic oncology practice in Turkey during the first 4 weeks after the first confirmed case compared to the same time interval in 2019. Retrospective data of patients from March 11 to April 11, 2020 and 2019 were collected from 5 major reference institutions (Samsun Ondokuz Mayis University, Adana Cukurova University, Izmir 9 Eylul University, Ankara University and Istanbul Marmara University) in 5 different geographical areas of Turkey.",

There was an increase of patients with highest ASA scores and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores are also increased from 2019 to 2020 [Table 1]. Two third of the \u201cnon-deferrable\u201d patients with the highest ASA scores in 2020 are referred from local hospitals. Since most of the local hospitals in Turkey are occupied with COVID-19 patients and had to cancel all surgeries during the study period, we believe these measures appear to be the reason for increased number of patients with higher comorbidities in our patient cohort of 2020. One limitation of our report is that we do not have the data on how many of patients were referred from local hospitals in 2019, so we cannot make a conclusion on these data. However, the increased rate of patients with higher comorbidities has not been translated to an increased rate of postoperative complication (Figure 2\n). We believe that decreased number of cases per day during COVID-19 cleared off the pressure to manage several cases within a limited time period and this might be one of the reasons for decreased early (14 days after the surgery) postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification in our patient cohort.",
