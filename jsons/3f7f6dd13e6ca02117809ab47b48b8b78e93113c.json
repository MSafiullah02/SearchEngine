A) Viruses were constructed to have the same HIV core with 3 different Envs: LAI (CXCR4 tropic), AD8 (CCR5 tropic), and VSV-G. The 3 constructed viruses were allowed to infect TZM-bl cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of sphinganine-N17. Representative viral infection inhibitory curves are presented (n\u03ed2) for LAI (OE), AD8 (), and VSV-G (). Corresponding IC 50 values of LAI and AD8 were 312 \u03ee 83 and 403 \u03ee 70 nM. B) Helical wheel representation demonstrates the interaction between the NHR regions of HIV gp41 in the core structure of the hairpin conformation, as observed in the crystal structures. Intermolecular association between the N helices occurs between positions a and d of the helical wheel. C) Mutational analysis of N17 interactions. In the N17mut(a,d) mutant(39), the residues at positions a and d of N17 were replaced by residues at positions f and c, respectively, of the CHR (residues are underscored). Residue numbers correspond to the HXB2 gp160 variant. In the scrambled N17 mutant, the residues of N17 were randomized. D) Sphingopeptides with mutated peptides, unable to self-interact or scrambled, lose their antiviral activity. TZM-bl cells were infected with fully infectious HXB2 HIV-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of N17mut(a,d) (), sphinganine-N17mut(a,d) (OE), scrambled N17 (), and sphinganine-scrambled N17 (\u25a1).Enfuvirtide E n f u v ir t id e", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Sphinganine potentiates the activity of N and C peptides in wild-type and enfuvirtideresistant viruses. A) Designation and location of the peptides within the gp41 core. The complex between N36 from the N helix and C34 from the C helix resembles the central core and is highlighted. The short domains N17 and DP19 are located within the central core, whereas the ShN17 extends from the core. Residue numbers correspond to the HXB2 gp160 variant. B-D) Viral infection inhibitory curves of the compounds and their corresponding IC 50 values. TZM-bl cells were infected with fully infectious HXB2 HIV-1 in the presence of increased concentrations of the indicated compounds.
