However, this also involves a decrease in the surface area of the activated carbon filter. The CO 2 elimination and sevoflurane (SEV) reflection of the old device (ACD-100) were thus compared with the new version (ACD-50) in patients sedated after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. After ERC approval and written informed consent, 23 patients were sedated with SEV, using first the ACD-100 and then the ACD-50 for 60 min each. With each device, patients were ventilated with tidal volumes (TV) of 5 ml/kg of ideal body weight for the first 30 min, and with 7 ml/kg for the next 30 min. Ventilation parameters, arterial blood gases, Bispectral-Index\u2122 (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), SEV concentrations exhaled by the patient (SEV-exhaled) and from the expiratory hose (SEVlost) were recorded every 30 min. A SEV reflection index was calculated: SRI [%] = 100 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 (SEV-lost/SEV-exhaled)). Data were compared using ANOVA with repeated measurements and Student's T-tests for pairs. Respiratory rates, tidal and minute volumes were not significantly different between the two devices. End tidal and arterial CO 2 partial pressures were significantly higher with the ACD-100 as compared with the ACD-50. SEV infusion rate remained constant. SEV reflection was higher (SRI: ACD-100 vs. ACD-50, TV 5 ml/kg: 95.29 \u00b1 6.45 vs. 85.54 \u00b1 11.15, p = 0.001; 7 ml/kg: 93.42 \u00b1 6.55 vs. 88.77 \u00b1 12.26, p = 0.003). BIS was significantly lower when using the higher TV (60.91 \u00b1 9.99 vs. 66.57 \u00b1 8.22, p = 0.012), although this difference was not clinically relevant. During postoperative sedation, the use of ACD-50 significantly reduced CO 2 retention. SEV reflection was slightly reduced. However, patients remained sufficiently sedated without increasing SEV infusion.",

These inhaled agents are minimally metabolized and thanks to their low solubility, are rapidly eliminated via the lungs. Because of these characteristics, such agents have been used as sedatives in an intensive care setting and have shown a shorter and more predictable time to awakening than occurs in sedation with intravenous agents [1] . Enlund et al. described the use of the reflection method in clinical practice for the first time in 2001. Reflection systems retain the anaesthetic during expiration and resupply it during the next inspiration. The AnaConDa\u00ae or Anaesthetic Conserving Device (Sedana Medical, Stockholm, Sweden) was the first medical product that permitted the efficient administration of volatile anaesthetic by the reflection technique [2] . Another device has been developed, the Mirus (Pall Medical, Dreieich, Germany), and it is the first to administer desflurane using reflection. The Mirus system can also be used for the delivery of sevoflurane and offers automatic target control of the end-tidal anaesthetic concentration [3] .",

In estimating the sevoflurane lost and exhaled, gas was sampled at the AnaConDa\u00ae sampling port and at the end of the expiratory hose of the ICU ventilator with two gas monitors (Vamos\u00ae, Dr\u00e4ger Medical, L\u00fcbeck, Germany; Fig. 1 ).

At the time of anaesthetic induction, a loading dose of 5 \u00b5g/kg of fentanyl was administered. All procedures were performed with cardiopulmonary bypass, with maintenance of SEV administration during this time. Transfer from the operating room to the ICU was achieved with the administration of boluses of 30 mg of propofol and fentanyl at a dose of 1 \u00b5g/kg. Upon admission to the recovery unit, patients were monitored conventionally with an electrocardiograph, and by taking measurements of the invasive arterial pressure, oxygen saturation and depth of anaesthesia. The Ana-ConDa\u00ae devices were purged by using the bolus function of the syringe pump with the volumes recommended by the manufacturer. The ventilator's parameters were set to volume control mode auto-flow, with an estimated tidal volume for the idealized weight of 5 ml/kg, with an I to E ratio of 1:2 and a respiratory rate for the end-tidal CO 2 between 40 and 45 mmHg measured by capnography. Sedation was commenced with an ACD-100, with an initial arterial blood gas sample analysis and recording of variables 30 min after arrival. After the collection of these data, the ventilation parameters were changed to 7 ml/kg, in accordance with the aims mentioned above, and a new arterial blood gas test and recording of spirometry values was performed after 60 min. The respiratory circuit was then changed to an ACD-50, with the ventilator settings returned to 5 ml/kg for 30 min while data were gathered. After 90 min, the settings were changed to 7/ml/kg ready for the final data collection at 120 min. After this was done, the feasibility of extubation after 120 min of admission was assessed in accordance with the unit's standard protocol.

The ACD-100 activated carbon filter is theoretically capable of absorbing 90% of the patient's exhaled gas [5] . With established infusion models, infusion rates of 10 ml/h are rarely exceeded in clinical practice [6] , which implies that the filter size might be excessive. It was thus surmised that the size of the device could be reduced without affecting its performance, thereby improving its operating limitations. These limitations are determined by the need for a minimum tidal volume of 350 ml, because the ACD-100 requires the insertion of an internal volume of 100 ml [7, 8] into the circuit. This restricts its use with paediatric populations and also for acute respiratory distress syndrome with protective ventilation parameters. On the basis of these premises, a \"new\" AnaConDa was designed, with an internal volume of 50 ml and minimum tidal volume of 200 ml [9] , permitting a significant reduction in the size of the activated carbon filter, while preserving its operational characteristics.",

The tidal volume increase necessary to maintain normal arterial carbon dioxide pressure, or normocapnia, has been termed reflective dead space [10] . Reflective dead space has been quantified as 40 ml for the ACD-100, and 25 ml for ACD-50 [4] . Hence, the total device dead space, that is, the sum of volumetric and reflective dead space, is 140 ml for the ACD-100 and 75 ml for the ACD-50. In order to assess reflection efficiency, a new index was defined, named the Sevoflurane Reflection Index (SRI). The aim was to develop a \"clinical\" index of the reflection capacity of the AnaConDa\u00ae that avoided assumptions made in other theoretical models that use artificial lungs [5, 11] . Such models estimate lost SEV and SEV in the patient in a balanced phase, in other words under steady state conditions. In this way, administration of SEV in the system is equal to the lost SEV exiting through the reflector. Thus, the concept of reflection efficiency is based on the amount of SEV exhaled or lost or re-inspired in the sense of net volume of gas. In this instance, concentrations of gas are measured, as it is not possible to calculate with precision the amount of SEV that is lost, since this is not a balanced phase. Even so, the SRI estimates the reflection capacity under real conditions in a simple manner that is clinically reproducible. Hence, it can be used for making comparisons between various types of apparatus and different volatile anaesthetics.",

There is an inconsistent finding in the data, in that the SRI was less with 5 ml/kg than with 7 ml/kg, in view of the fact that the filter's in vitro reflection efficiency is supposed to be inversely related to the product of the gas concentration and programmed tidal volume [11] . On the basis of the data analysed, a possible explanation for this finding is that use in standard practice involves changes in temperature and humidity which may affect the filter's reflection efficiency [12] .",

However, it is known that with the previous characteristics the environmental pollution limits recommended by the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of two parts per million were not exceeded [13] . There were no changes in the handling of the device or the loading of the syringe [14] , so the risks are currently the same for both. Fig. 1 Outline design of the study. Sevoflurane measurements were performed using Vamos\u00ae monitors (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany) in the gas sampling port and expiratory branch of the AnaConDa (Sedana Medical, Sweden), next to the ventilator connection. With the same patient, blood gas measurements were performed at minutes 30, 60, 90 and 120 during the postoperative period, the first two with the \"older\" device and the last two with the \"new\" device The data showed no differences in the minute volumes obtained with the two devices, although the arterial pCO 2 and Vamos\u00a9 monitor pCO 2 values were lower with the ACD-50. This might be because of lower CO 2 retention in this device which has a smaller device dead space. Reflective dead space was attenuated by volatile agents [9, 15] , but these effects of sevoflurane do not seem sufficient to compensate for the decrease in the total device space in the ACD-50. This pCO 2 reduction does not seem to correspond to haemodynamic impairment, as the MAP showed no differences between the groups, although this is not truly an appropriate measure of cardiac output. There were no differences in the oxygenation values between the devices. In terms of the respiratory mechanics study, the devices did not affect plateau pressures. Previous studies have assessed the influence of the ACD-100 on respiratory effort [16] and concluded that introducing a gas (sevoflurane) into the circuit minimizes the influence of the device, with characteristics approximating to those of the humidifier filters commonly employed.",
