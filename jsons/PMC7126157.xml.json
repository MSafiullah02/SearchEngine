Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most extensively studied PRR family to date (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) (Thompson et al., 2011) with 13 members identified in mammals (Nie et al., 2018). TLRs are characterised by an extracellular, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Bell et al., 2003) and a conserved intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain (Janssens and Beyaert, 2003). Binding to the LRR extracellular domain results in recruitment of TIRs and initiation of intracellular signalling leading to inflammatory cytokine production (Akira and Takeda, 2004).",

Polymorphisms in TLR4 have been associated with hyporesponsiveness to LPS (Arbour et al., 2000) and are proposed to contribute to sepsis (Anderberg et al., 2017; Rosadini and Kagan, 2017). In addition to LPS, TLR4 binds a broad range of structurally unrelated bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal PAMPs (Mukherjee et al., 2016) so SNPs in the TLR4 gene can potentially alter susceptibility to diverse infectious diseases (Lass-Florl et al., 2013). For example, TLR4 polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed Caucasian patients (Bochud et al., 2008; Carvalho et al., 2009; de Boer et al., 2011) and with a protective effect against congenital toxoplasmosis (Wujcicka et al., 2015).",

Feline TLR4 has been associated with infectious disease pathogenesis in cats; expression of TLR4 is increased in neutrophil exposure to Microsporum canis, and in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Cambier et al., 2016; Watanabe et al., 2018) while progesterone-induced TLR4 down-regulation is implicated in the development of pyometra in breeding queens (Jursza et al., 2015). Feline breed-specific differences in susceptibility to viral and fungal infections, including FIP and invasive mycoses, are documented (Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006; Worthing et al., 2012; Barrs et al., 2015), but potential underlying immune dysfunction remains under-investigated. A key co-receptor in feline coronavirus infection, the C-type lectin PRR, DC-SIGN, was investigated for polymorphisms and a SNP in the DC-SIGN extracellular domain was associated with FIP susceptibility (Wang et al., 2014).",

This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that amino acid residues 285\u2013366, a region which includes most of LRR 10, mediate the ability of TLR4 to differentiate between difference types of LPS (Hajjar et al., 2002) and that the Asp299Gly substitution results in LPS hyporesponsiveness (Arbour et al., 2000).",

The higher number of non-synonymous SNPs identified in bovines compared to dogs and cats may reflect the higher number of individuals investigated or greater overall genetic diversity in this species. Notwithstanding, the rate of deleterious SNPs is similar between the three species. This is similar also in humans, where despite the high number of SNPs identified in the TLR4 gene, most have minimal detrimental effects on phenotype (Vaure and Liu, 2014).",

The six SNPs for which all cats in the current study were homozygous for the alternate allele, are also reported as the alternate allele in the reference genomic sequence (GCF_000181335.3), suggesting that these are SNPs within the genome of the cat from which the cDNA reference sequence was created.",

Despite these breed differences, only two of these variants were non-synonymous and neither was identified to affect the protein structure of the receptor. As such, TLR4 dysfunction does not appear to be associated with breed differences in disease susceptibility in cats in Australia.
