While the genetic research confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is originated in bats, there are other speculations that other wild animals could serve as intermediary between bats and man, with pangolins leading as primary suspects as the intermediary in the case of Wuhan coronavirus (Liu et al., 2019) . SARS-CoV-2 spread like other cold viruses and early symptoms include, but not limited to, runny nose, severe cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, etc. With several precautions and awareness on the deadly virus and its spread, more cases of infection are being anticipated globally. The known cases are being managed with supplemental oxygen and conservative fluid administration as there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral agent to treat the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the concerned researchers are continuously working on developing a vaccine or drug for novel coronavirus (Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019) .",

Virtual screening (VS) is one of the methods used in CADD and it enables screening of many compounds in a relatively short time compared to the high throughput screening via laboratory experiments (Kapetanovic, 2008; Leelananda and Lindert, 2016; Macalino et al., 2015; Manas and Green, 2017; Melo-Filho et al., 2019) . Moreover, molecular docking as well as machine learning, can be used in virtual screening and these further enable effectiveness of VS (Mori et al., 2012; Pereira et al., 2020) . For example, VS was employed in the development of approved drugs such as Aggrastat, a fibrinogen receptor, and Cevoglitazar, an effective PPAR-\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonist for diabetes treatment (Clark, 2008) . Recently, the use of consensus scoring has been acknowledged to also improve the enrichment of true positives and improve hit rates (Charifson et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2002; Feher, 2006) . Herein, we employed computer-aided drug design that entails the use of consensus scoring to combine both molecular J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f docking and machine learning VS method to discover potential inhibitors of the surface glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 which is responsible for virus binding and entry. Our results identify three compounds with promising physicochemical properties and favorable molecular interactions with the target protein, and by extension, these identified compounds can undergo lead optimization to be further developed as drugs that can be used in treating the COVID-19.",

            "text": "Due to the recent emergent of the coronavirus disease, there are not many crystal structures of high resolution of the virus. As at the time the bulk of this work was completed, there was no crystal structure of the spike protein. Hence, homology modeling (Haddad et al., 2020; Krieger et al., 2003; Xiang, 2006) was employed. However, as at the end of March, 2020, there are currently about 100 crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 deposited in the protein databank (www.rscb.org, Burley et al., 2018) . It is intended that the best among these structures, particularly the spike proteins (PDB ID: 6VSB, 6VYB, 6LZG, 6MOJ and 6VXX) (Lan et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) , would be used for future works. The surface spike glycoprotein functions as the cell-attachment recognition site hence, the reason for its consideration as the target protein as this is the critical part of the virus responsible for virus entry and binding (Gralinski and Menachery, 2020) . The target protein was prepared using homology modeling with the aid of the Raptor program (Peng and Xu, 2011) . The template protein used for the homology model is PDB ID: 5X58 (Yuan et al., 2017) . The sequence of the glycoprotein utilized to build the homology model was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (Wu et al., 2020) with the accession number: MN908947. The modeled structure was validated using the Ramachandran plot analysis with the aid of RAMPAGE webtool (Lovell et al., 2003; Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968) and PrankWeb server (Jendele et al., 2019) to validate the amino residued involved in the protein-ligand interactions. The ConSurf web program (Ashkenazy et al., 2016) was used for the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) analysis, conserved score and phylogentic analysis.",

The second virtual screening, BindScope, employed a machine learning technique (convoluted neural network). Recently, machine learning technique is gaining considerable attention in the drug discovery process as it is much faster than molecular docking. Moreover, having a different method rather than another molecular docking program with a different scoring method helps reduce the number of false positives (Chen et al., 2018; Stevens, 2014) . The latest iteration of DUD-E database (Mysinger et al., 2012) was used in the training of BindScope. This database was comprised of 22,886 active compounds and 50 similar decoys for each active and docked against 102 different targets (Koes et al., 2013) . To ensure a fair benchmarking, the targets were clustered by employing a 70% sequence similarity cut-off which was provided by blastclust in the RSCB PDB database (www.rscb.org, Burley et al., 2018) . To use BindScope, the target protein, the homology modeled structure of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in this case, was uploaded in PDB to the web application alongside a set of docked ligands (in this case the top 500 scored ligands from the first virtual screening) in structure-data file (SDF) format. The results from the virtual screenings were combined for consensus scoring using the rank voting method (Feher, 2006) to select the compounds which appeared as top-scored in both virtual screenings. The consensus scoring J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f method is known to improve HIT rates by reducing the chances of false positives (Charifson et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2010; Stevens, 2014; Yang and Hsu, 2005) and has been applied in finding potential inhibitors of protein kinase B in anti-cancer drug discovery (Forino et al., 2005) . The Discovery studio program (BIOVIA, 2015) was used to visualize the molecular interactions of the selected HITS with that target protein. Figure 1 shows the flowchart that depicts the entire process of selecting hit compounds.",

The phylogentic tree suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats (Fan et al., 2019) . The MSA of SARS-CoV-2 was done with the other 29 species depicted in the phylogentic tree (Table S8 ). The conservation score which is a score allotted to each amino acid in a MSA is used to determine how conserved the amino acid is. A score value of 9 (maroon color) means the amino acid is well conserved while a value of 1(cyan color) means it is variable (Fig. 4) . The conservation scores of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S2 ) denote that about 60 % of the amino acids are conserved, that is they have a conservation score of at least 6.",

All the three compounds comply with the Lipinski's RO5 (Lipinski, 2016; Lipinski et al., 2001) . The oral bioavailability radar ( Fig. 9) shows that the colored zone is the perfect space for the physicochemical space. The LIPO (Lipophilicity) is derived from the XLOGP3 parameter (Table 1) Table 2 presents the results of the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and Toxicity) analysis that was done using the AMDETSAR and SWISS ADME web tools (Cheng et al., 2012; Daina et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018) . The green-colored cells indicate excellent ADMET properties; the blue means good while the yellow and pink signify caution is needed and slightly dangerous respectively. These color codes may help during lead optimization to know what properties need to be modified. For all three selected ligands, they have good absorption properties, particularly concerning their human oral bioavailability which has been earlier suggested from the bioavailability radar. For distribution, the selected ligands are all permeants of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, the selected ligands are not substrate for the P-gp or the multidrug resistance protein that is responsible for transporting substances across the cell membrane. Hence, they can quickly move across the cell membrane. The metabolism of the selected compounds was predicted for cytochrome P450 inhibitors which catalyze many reactions involve in the metabolism of drugs. Compounds A and B are predicted to be inhibitors of CYP1A2 inhibitor while for the other cytochromes, all three selected ligands are non-inhibitors.",

As there are no known drugs or vaccines to treat this outbreak, developing one is paramount and computer-aided drug design is a useful tool in fast-tracking the discovery and development of new drugs that can be used to treat this disease. The consensus scoring approach has been used to combine virtual screening results from both molecular docking and machine learning to select three compounds. These compounds have the potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein which is responsible for virus entry and binding. The molecular docking (VINA) scores of the selected compounds A, B and C are -4.9 Kcal/mol, -4.6 Kcal/mol and -4.6 Kcal/mol, while their corresponding scores from machine learning (BINDSCOPE) are 0.992, 0.989 and 0.993 respectively. Both compounds B and C interact with amino acid residues which are conserved with ILE 1013 which is well conserved in surface glycoprotein. Compound C which has the highest score based on BINDSCOPE also has the best oral bioavailability, has all its parameters are within the recommended range.

Three compounds namely MCULE-2442351665-0-1, MCULE-6855995445-0-2 and MCULE-4671321297-0-1 appear in the top 25 scored ligands for both VINA and BINDSCOPE. MCULE-2442351665-0-1 is the 15 th and 13 th top scored ligand in VINA and BINDSCOPE respectively while MCULE-6855995445-0-2 appears as the 24 th and 17 th top scored ligand in VINA and BINDSCOPE respectively. MCULE-4671321297-0-1 comes in as the 25 th and 9 th top scored ligand in VINA and BINDSCOPE respectively.
