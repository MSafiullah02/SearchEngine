The cases of patients with preexisting kidney disease prior to pregnancy differs in the differential diagnosis from new onset kidney disease that develops because of pregnancy. The focus of this chapter is to review the evaluation of new onset kidney injury as a result of pregnancy. This chapter does not attempt to review the newly diagnosed patient with kidney disease that may be discovered during pregnancy, that in and of itself is not thought related to pregnancy. When kidney involvement occurs, from proteinuria alone to elevation of creatinine, pathologic systemic changes related to the fetal-placenta interaction provokes the obstetric provider to heighten their level of concern for the maturing fetus and the welfare of the mother. While the diagnosis of preeclampsia is easily the fi rst consideration given how common it is, a broaden differential is employed. Before doing so, a discussion of kidney physiology during pregnancy is prudent as well as a review of the diagnostic tools used in kidney function assessment during pregnancy.",

            "text": "Practically assessing GFR during pregnancy has all the fl aws as in the non-obstetric realm but has the added nuisances of increased GFR and urinary stasis. The best test was discerned by comparing inulin versus 24 h creatinine clearance as well as using the modi fi cation of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula in healthy pregnant women and women with preeclampsia or chronic kidney disease (CKD) [ 3 ] . In healthy pregnant women the 24 h creatinine clearance was better than the MDRD by 40 cc/min. In women with preeclampsia or prior CKD the MDRD underestimated the GFR in both by 25 cc/min. Because the GFRs were >60 the MDRD formula loses its' integrity in this population. Following serum creatinines is certainly useful, but the absence of changes in creatinine may not be indicative of true GFR changes and so 24 h urine collections may be instructive. Estimating proteinuria during pregnancy also has its limitations as in the non-obstetric world. If one assumes the urine protein to creatinine ratio (PCR) is expected to hold in pregnancy, it is useful for quanti fi cation for diagnosis of preeclampsia and monitor preexisting kidney disease. Urine dipsticks routinely have high rates of false positives and negatives compared to 24 h urines and do not take into consideration the speci fi c gravity in the guidelines when assessing proteinuria such as in preeclampsia. Most nephrologists do not speak in terms of urine protein dipsticks. However, urinary stasis complicates the utility of the urine PCR. There is suf fi cient data in the literature that demonstrates that the spot urine PCR has been shown to correlate well with 24 h urine collections [ 4, 5 ] . Certainly, if the cutoff value is questionable, a 24 h urine collection for creatinine and protein should be done.",

With both of these presentations, nephrology involvement is rare. The obstetric provider will manage these scenarios without the need for specialized consultation.

Obstetrical hemorrhage can occur during pregnancy, immediately postpartum or delayed postpartum. Severe cases can cause hemorrhagic shock, thus leading to renal hypoperfusion and oligouria.

The median gestation is 36 weeks reportedly occurring between 22 and 40 weeks. The classic presentation of this rare disease is hypoglycemia, transaminitis, elevated coagulation studies, hypo fi brinogenemia, kidney injury, and fatty in fi ltration of the liver. However, the exclusion of these signs does not rule out the diagnosis. The largest series of AFLP studied to date came from a population of over 1.1 million deliveries in the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System Study between 2005 and 2006 [ 6 ] . Providers diagnosed only 61 women with AFLP, 90% of which were retrospectively con fi rmed by the authors using the previously described Swansea criteria [ 7 ] (see Table 48 .3 ). Of the 57 women meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of AFLP, 1 woman died; and of the 67 infants, there were 7 deaths, yielding a perinatal mortality rate of 104 per 1,000 births. Liver ultrasound is not typically very helpful when performed, and in the aforementioned study showed evidence of disease by ascites or echogenicity in only 27% of women. Liver biopsies are seldom performed, as the maternal condition is typically too unstable. However, autopsies have shown swollen pale hepatocytes with central nuclei and positive fat staining.",

This is an autosomal recessively inherited condition that results in the inability of the fetus to transport free fatty acids (FFA) into the liver mitochondria, thereby preventing its metabolism. Fetuses homozygous for LCHAD de fi ciency return high levels of FFA to maternal circulation, yielding excess levels of FFA. High levels of FFA in the already mildly comprised maternal heterozygous liver puts a strain on maternal hepatic activity, resulting in AFLP.

Enlarged blood vessels in the pelvis may cause ureteral compression, especially at the pelvic brim. The enlarging uterus displaces the ureters laterally, and on rare occasions can directly compress the ureters. The resulting urinary obstruction is marked by severe abdominal pain and inability to void. Resolution with maternal position changes aids in making the diagnosis. In these severe cases ureteral stents can relieve the ureteral compression, but in case of stent failure, delivery may be required.",

            "text": "As a way of categorizing vascular involvement as a cause of intrinsic acute kidney injury, one may distinguish this entity from both large and small vessels. The large renal arteries, when occluded, may be de fi ned as prerenal kidney failure. When the small capillaries in the glomerular are primarily involved, this is nephritis or nephrosis. When the interlobular arteries are involved, we speak of intrinsic vascular involvement. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an intrinsic cause of renal vascular disease. It is composed of the syndromes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS), both of which are seen in pregnancy. The pathology does overlap, with thrombi in the glomeruli, and injury to the interlobular arteries is seen as intimal thickening and onion skinning. The pathogenesis relates to Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) maintenance by ADAMTS-13 enzyme molecules [ 57 ] . The VWF multimeric structures are secreted from stimulated endothelial cells. When the activity of ADAMTS-13 is absent or reduced, VWF cleavage does not occur and platelets adhere and aggregate onto the uncleaved VWF molecules forming microvascular platelet thrombi. Severe congenital de fi ciency of ADAMTS-13 caused by gene mutations or inhibition of the enzyme caused by acquired autoantibodies, in fl ammatory cytokines, estrogen or bacterial toxins, results in TTP [ 57 ] . HUS is described in association with infections by the Shiga toxin-producing hemorrhagic strains of E. coli [ 58 ] . HUS presents with a greater degree of kidney injury, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy. TTP-HUS is extremely rare during pregnancy and postpartum. They af fl ict <1 case in 100,000 pregnancies [ 59 ] . One review of the literature from 1955 to 2006, only noted 166 cases of TTP, distinguished from HUS by creatinines <3 mg/dl, and 55% of the cases occurred in the second trimester, whereas 33% occurred after 28 weeks [ 60 ] . The classic diagnosis of TTP/HUS includes the pentad of thrombocytopenia, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, kidney injury, neurologic abnormalities, and fever but not all of these fi ndings are present. The ADAMTS-13 activity is absent to markedly reduced in 33-100% of patients with TTP but in HUS that is not the case [ 59 ] . TTP-HUS has similarities with HELLP that may confuse the diagnosis and therefore the management. TTP/HUS should be favored as a diagnosis if the patient has a past history of TTP/HUS, ADAMTS-13 activity <5%, severe hemolytic anemia, markedly reduce platelets, a bloody diarrheal prodrome, congenital TTP-HUS, or presentation in the fi rst trimester. Plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma should be considered if a HELLP-like syndrome persists beyond 3 days postpartum and/or sooner if there is life-threatening microangiopathy. Our case #1 had diarrhea, but the platelets were only modestly reduced and the LDH was only modestly increased and there were no shistocytes on the smear, making TTP-HUS less likely. In case #2, the moderate shistocytes and more elevated creatinine raises the specter of TTP-HUS more so and thus plasma exchange should be considered as the patient is followed.",

The creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl appears normal for a nonpregnant patient but is noticeable elevated for pregnancy. The initial blood pressure does not meet the de fi ned criteria for this disease but that is not always necessary and certainly blood pressures may fl uctuate. The patient does have other constitutional signs consistent with a systemic process, and the subsequent blood pressures became consistent with preeclampsia. Other considerations for her presentation are AFLP as the patient meets six or more of the Swansea criteria, those being vomiting, elevated bilirubin, uric acid, ammonia, AST, PT, and leukocytosis. If the patient has HELLP, it is likely considered partial as the AST is not >70 U/l, the platelet count is not <100,000, the LDH is not >600 U/l and there was no hemolysis seen on the peripheral smear. TTP is unlikely without hemolysis but this and HUS should be followed after delivery.

This patient has elevated blood pressures without proteinuria, thus she does not meet criteria for preeclampsia. Proteinuria is not necessary for the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, and in such circumstances the diagnosis is known as \"atypical HELLP.\" She has several features of HELLP syndrome including severe right upper quadrant pain, evidence of hemolysis, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. But the clinical picture is confused by renal insuf fi ciency which is a sign of possible TTP-HUS. Whereas the clinical picture for HELLP and TTP-HUS is very similar, treatment strategies are quite different. Delivery for this patient is indicated, as preeclampsia or some variant (such as HELLP), cannot be completely excluded. Given the elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and RUQ pain, HUS is an unlikely diagnosis, but should be considered, especially if the patient does not improve clinically within 48 h after delivery. Postpartum, the patient's AST and ALT continued to rise peaking in the 300 s and her platelets fell to a nadir of 32,000 on postpartum day 1 with a stable creatinine. In this case, a multidisciplinary team with seasoned expert consultants can be helpful in determining if plasma exchange is necessary. She made a full recovery by her 1-week postpartum visit, con fi rming the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome.",
