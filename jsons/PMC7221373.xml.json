Even though most of the infected individuals have mild or no symptoms, some of them exhibit more serious complications, including severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Clinical markers can be valuable for efficient allocation of resources during a pandemic.",

Nevertheless, these findings lead us to postulate that cerebrovascular and cardiovascular comorbidities might independently be associated with severity of COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the latest evidence on the association between cerebrovascular, cardiovascular disease, and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

The risk of publication bias is high, as shown by the asymmetrical inverted funnel plot. Information regarding the use of chronic medications such as ACEI/ARB were lacking. The included studies only investigate cerebrovascular disease as comorbidity; recent evidences showed that it may be precipitated by COVID-19, we encouraged future studies to investigate this matter. The broad category of cerebrovascular disease did not differentiate between intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and SAH. The location of the insult was not differentiated, as certain locations of cerebrovascular damage have greater associations with autonomic dysfunction which possibly link increase mortality and COVID.",
