The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310-400 nm, UV-B: 280-310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O 3 . In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27-31, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show bene fi cial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety ). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed.",

Despite the progress in synthetic drug chemistry, plants still constitute an important source of new products of medicinal value for pharmaceuticals, used commercially either as an antioxidants or nutritional supplements (Zhang and Bj\u00f6rn 2009 ) . Among the many medicinal plants routinely used as Ayurvedic medicines in India, some of these plants have been featured in Fig. 1 Kumari and M.N.V. Prasad drugs are simple synthetic modi fi cations of these naturally plant derived secondary metabolites. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid by consumers and researchers to the health and nutritional aspects of metabolites such as phenolics, vitamins, minerals and others. Secondary metabolites biosynthesis is a new tool in the generation of novel and expensive natural products. Many of these phytocompounds; phenols, fl avonoids, steroids, alkaloids, terpenoids, anthocyanins, glycoscynates, b -carotene, ascorbic acid, polyamines, synaptic ester, volatile oil, having high antioxidant potential, be helpful in treatments of several oxidative stress related disorders (Krishnaiah et al. 2007 ; Kaur and Arora 2009 ) . These antioxidants mitigate the risk of number of chronic and cardiovascular problems and other free radical mediated diseases including neuro degeneration (Nambiar et al. 2010 ) . Finding new natural sources of antioxidant compounds with potential antiradical activity can be useful to future therapy against various stress related health problems.",

Ultraviolet-B radiation (280-310 nm) is one factor, expected to modify the chemical composition of plants and induces changes in level of secondary metabolites. Recently, the knowledge about the treatment response of UV-B exposure on different plant metabolites in terms of \"health bene fi cial aspects\" is exponentially increasing and has led to novel insights, especially as far as medical, pharmacological and nutritive aspects are concerned (Jansen et al. 2008 ) . Evidently, based on fi ndings by various researchers this novel concept may be presented that, UV-B supplementation might be bene fi cial for sustainable agriculture, food and nutritional industries for determining the high commercial utilization of these natural medicinal products (Kumari et al. 2009a, c ; Kumari and Agrawal 2010 ; Sun et al. 2010 ; Eichholz et al. 2011 ) .",

So on in present scenario, medicinal and aromatic plants occupy a priming economic position because of the continuous and increased demands of their products at local, national and international markets. Further, there has been ever increasing demand especially from developing country for more and more drug from plant resources. India is one of the major exporters of crude drugs mainly to six developed countries; USA, Germany, France, Switzerland, U.K. and Japan, who share about major export of total market. According to World Bank study, Global market for the Botanical medicines is estimated as around US $60, and is projected to reach US$5 trillion by 2050 (WHO 2003 ) . About 75-80% of the total exports of crude drugs come from India (Shetty 2011 ) .

            "text": "The growing demand of plant-based medicines, health products, pharmaceuticals, food supplements, in etc., is putting an unsustainable threatening on forests resulted in increased hazard and extinction of several species, because of overexploitation of wild plant populations. Forests contribute to more than 90% of the medicinal plants used for manufacturing medicines. Large-scale wild harvesting from the forests has caused serious depletion of a number of economically-important species, loss of genetic biodiversity, environmental degradation. According to estimate, more than 4,000 species of medicinal plants are globally threatened, largely due to commercial over-harvesting to meet the demand from pharmaceutical industries (Schippmann et al. 2002 ) . So on, conservation of medicinal plants is needed for a number of reasons. Firstly, they are an important source of natural ingredients used by the manufacturers of modern pharmaceuticals. Second, its tremendous use as botanical dietary supplements in past few decades, leads to continuous erosion of forest and the forest product (Kala et al. 2006 ) . Shifting from wild harvesting to cultivation techniques appeared to be an important alternative strategy to overcome the problem (Uniyal et al. 2000 ) . In cultivation, agro-technological processing can be manipulated in order to achieve desired products, increased yield or stable concentrations of biologically active phytocompounds and reduced toxin level of botanical products (Canter et al. 2005 ) . Cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants gives scope to optimize yield and achieve a uniform, high quality product at cost of least destruction (Wiersum et al. 2006 ) . As a concluding remark, in this section, we summarized the aspects of biodiversity loss related to wild harvesting of plants and cultivation strategy of medicinal plants from the wild, to be -of better option, to conserve valuable wild medicinal plants. 230 R.

A large number of medicinal plant species have already been tested for their potential biological, therapeutic and pharmaceutical activities worldwide (Majhenic et al. 2007 ; Mata et al. 2007 ; Wannissorn et al. 2005 ) . Several studies from different countries have con fi rmed their antioxidants activity in various plants having rich medicinal value (Desmarchelier et al. 1998 ; Liu and Ng 2000 ; Souri et al. 2008 ; Ayoola et al. 2008 ) . Fenglin et al. ( 2004 ) have screened the free radical scavenging activity of Chinese medical woody plants showed that most of them are employed for their effects on hemostasis, as anti-in fl ammatory, antimicrobial or for treatment of dysentery and there medicinal uses may be directly linked to the content in tannins and fl avonoids and consequently to their free radical scavenging activities. Zakaria ( 2007 ) identi fi ed the biochemical compounds such as Flavonoids, triterpenes, saponins and tannins responsible for the observed antioxidant activity in some herbal species; e.g. Muntingia calabura ; Bauhinia purpurea ; Dicranopteris linearis ; Melastoma malabathricum ; Corchorus capsularis. Pourmorad et al. ( 2006 ) noticed that greater amount of phenolic compounds relates with higher radical scavenging effects in Mellilotus of fi cinalis . In India also, several investigators has been worked at this speci fi c context in assessing the antioxidant capacity of herbal medicine (Chanda and Dave 2009 ; Kaur et al. 2008 ; Ali et al. 2008 ) . Prakash et al. ( 2007 ) have identi fi ed the total phenol, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of some Indian medicinal plants, e.g. Azadirachta indica, Cassia fi stula, Casuarina equisetifolia, Indigofera tinctoria, Lawsonia inermis and Trewia nudi fl ora . These plants are having high phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Kshirsagar and Upadhyay ( 2009 ) have studied the antioxidative effects of 32 plant species from Tripura, northeastern India and observed that 16 of them e.g. Mitragyna rotundifolia, Schima walichii, Syzigium cerasoides and others showed higher antioxidants potential depends on their dose dependent activity. Jain et al. ( 2010 ) have studied on Alangium salvifolium and reported that the extract from its roots have interesting potential free radical scavenging activity for treatment of diseases. Patel et al. ( 2010 ) worked on antioxidant activity of some selected medicinal plants from western region of India and screened the high radical scavenging activity in the stem of Kigelia followed by leaf of Hibiscus, Gemelia and Kigelia . Since the phyto-constituents and volatiles of medicinal herbs have created renewed demand in their use by the public, explorations of health bene fi ts and antioxidant potential of these metabolites in the prevention of oxidative stress problems is needed. This part described the summarized view on antioxidant activity of various medicinal plants. Most of the medicinal plants are rich antioxidants due to its different active ingredients that determine its antioxidant potential. ",

They found to be derived mainly from phenylalanine and tyrosine. \"Phenolics act as multiple defense response as in photo-oxidative pigmentation such as anthocyanins, fl avonoids), antioxidation\" (Alothman et al. 2009 ) . The combination of antioxidant abilities and scavenging reducing radicals makes the phytophenols ideal substrate for balancing the cell redox status under oxidative stressed condition (Dai and Mumper 2010 ) . Studies showed that the phytophenols can also quickly repair DNA radical anions by an electron transfer reaction (Sperandio et al. 2002 ) . Among polyphenolic UV-B screening pigments, fl avonoids aroused considerable interest because of their long had been shown bene fi cial effects on human health. They have been reported to have antiviral, anti-allergic, anti-stress and estrogenic activity, mitigating the risk of coronary heart diseases, amazing cardioprotective effects through inhibition of peroxidation of low-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, reduce platelet aggregation, or reduce ischemic damage (Nambiar et al. 2010 ; Kim et al. 2008 ) . Originally their good effects were thought to be due to their \"antioxidative\" effect and chelating capacity (Atmani et al. 2009 ) . Some research evidences noticed the anti-tumor promoting activity of fl avonoids via mechanisms as kinase inhibition and apoptosis (cell cycle arrested) (Kanadaswami et al. 2005 ) .",

Carotenoids could possibly play an important role as anticarcinogenic drug and in preventing several stress related human disorder such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, and other degenerative pathologies such as diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (Gonz\u00e1lez-Gallego et al. 2007 ) .

UV-B response on it's biosynthesis and regulation have been very thoroughly explored. Two groups of genes are required for fl avonoids biosynthesis: structural genes that encode the enzymes that directly participate in fl avonoid biosynthesis, and transcription factors that regulate the expression of the structural genes and the accumulation of fl avonoids.

Flavonoid and glucosinolate induction depend partly on the same signaling pathways, which involve jasmonic acid (Mackerness and Thomas 1999 ; Textor and Gershenzon 2009 ) . UV-B application increased the aromatic glucosinolate glucotropaeolin concentration up to sixfold in comparison to the control plants in case study on short-term and moderate UV-B radiation effects on a herbal medicinal plant nasturtium ( Tropaeolum majus ) (Schreiner et al. 2009 ) . Wang et al. ( 2011 ) investigated the contents of glucosinolates and the expression of related genes in response to enhanced UV-B radiation and reported that when Arabidopsis leaves were irradiated by acute UV-B (1.55 W\u00b7m\u22122) for a short time (1 h), it induced the production of glucosinolates, however over exposure (12 h) inhibited the expression of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes and glucosinolate contents decreased. Scienti fi c interest in UV-B research on anthocyanin pigments have been well documented because of their possible health bene fi ts as dietary antioxidants. Anthocyanins, a class of fl avonoids is believed to increase the antioxidant potential of plants in order to uphold the balanced physiological status in tissues under UV-B stressed factor. The elevated levels of the transcripts of Pal, Dfr and Ans were accompanied by an increase in the anthocyanin pigments (Guo et al. 2008 ) . In several medicinal/fruited cultivars, anthocyanin accumulation is induced by light in the UV-B region (wavelengths from 280 to 320 nm) when applied in combination with solar infrared radiation (Arakawa 1988 ) . Ubi et al. ( 2006 ) reported the increased accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in apple fruit skin by inducing the expression of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, especially chalcone synthase, anthocyanidin synthase and anthocyanin \u22123-O-glucosyl transferase genes.",

The biosynthesis of terpenes starts with isopreneoid unit with precursors of isopentenyl and dimethylallyl diphosphate. Activation of two independent pathway cytosolic acetyl mevalonate, that provides precursor for sesquiterpene and sterols and/or plastidial 1-desoxy-D-xylose-5-phosphate/methyl D-erythritol phosphate for isopentenyl and dimethylallyl diphosphate precursors (Hampel et al. 2005 ) . In a recent publication on grapevine leaves, Gil et al. ( 2012 ) suggest that UV-B modulates the metabolism of terpenes leading to speci fi c responses according to fl uence rate of UV-B. Relatively low UV-B irradiation induces the de novo synthesis of enzymes of terpene cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway leading to production of terpenes, triterpenes and sterols, while high UV-B irradiance promoted the production of plastidic diterpenes via the methylerytritol phosphate pathway. The effect of increased UV-B irradiation on the expression of genes involved in early steps of terpenoid biosynthesis was reported in peppermint oil by Dolzhenko et al. ( 2010 ) . \"They observed that UV-B irradiation increased the content of some monoterpenes e.g. methol) and sesquiterpenes\" e.g. b -caryophyllene and germacrene-D which correlates with induced up-regulation of genes involved such as Dxs, Ippi, Gpps, and Fpps. Alkaloid biosynthesis in plants is also tightly controlled in response to UV-B stress. Tryptophan decarboxylase, a key enzyme in biosynthesis of the precursor tryptamine needed for monoterpene indole alkaloid production, can be strongly induced by UV-B light at the level of transcription (Ouwerkerk et al. 1999 ) .",

Active researches into novel strategy implied for promoting metabolites production, will de fi nitely be of great importance in present and future in terms of their commercial value. Additional knowledge on speci fi c effect of light quality on metabolites induction will help us in designing the greenhouse light environment to obtain plants with enhanced phytochemical concentrations. The approaches discussed above -health value of various metabolites, UV-B induction of these phytocompounds, secondary biosynthetic pathway, and the UV-B induction of regulatory genes -are likely to be used in combination with new high-throughput strategies to identify the most preferred route correlating with desired metabolite biosynthesis in different plants under UV-B exposure experiments. Provided that models are validated to ensure they re fl ect reality in targeted increase in phytochemicals, this information will be of great value for identifying and increasing the health promoting effects of medicinal plants and predicting the cropping strategies on these plants in a changing global climate. This baseline information generated will be useful for the successful implementation of UV technology on a pilot scale, to bene fi t health conscious consumers, attributed to concurrent increase in different health-related constituents. Future research studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of different doses/ exposure time of UV-B on the contents and heath qualities of products in multiple cases which have not yet been investigated. Such data sets will provide a wealth of information to ecologists, plant breeders and agronomists.",
