The issue concerning sustainable approach to healthcare system design has become increasingly important. A growing number of hospitals are becoming more interested in implementing sustainable methods at the existing facilities. Making changes in purchasing, materials management, work practices, and waste management can reduce or eliminate harmful environmental hazards at the healthcare facilities. Hazards can also be reduced by changing how wastes are treated. Improved sorting and recycling systems reduce the amount of waste that must be incinerated. Far more materials are disposed in the average medical waste disposer than necessary to protect the public and the patients from disease (SH, 2010). Only 15% of hospital waste is considered infectious waste that requires special treatment. Pathological waste such as tissues and organs which comprises 2% of average hospital waste requires incineration (Rutala and Mayhall, 1992).",

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency anticipates that the costs of meeting new regulations and standards will lead some healthcare facilities to switch to alternative waste disposal methods (U.S. EPA, 2002). In the light of the above challenges, the concept of the closed-loop supply chain becomes an attractive option for minimizing hospital waste. However, lack of awareness of the closed-loop supply chain and its short research history is the main reason why hospitals have not considered it in the past. Moreover, closed-loop supply chains add complexity to overall supply chain management and requires an initial investment (Ostlin et al., 2008).",

The healthcare business is provided by a variety of product and service enterprises including medical consumables, pharmaceuticals, catering, laundry cleaning, waste management, home-care products, information technology, vehicle fleet management and general supplies (Gattorna, 1998). There is little research on cost containment by applying cutting edge supply chain concepts in healthcare industry. Analysis of the complete healthcare system indicates that the supply management system is one of the primary areas where cost reductions are a predictable outcome (Kumar et al., 2008).",

For some reason, researchers have not attempted to examine the logistical operations of healthcare. The logistics community has also not recognized the similarity and made the comparison between the manufacturing of products and the provision of healthcare in process reengineering (Kumar and Shim, 2006). Many investigators have studied the cases of process redesign in healthcare supply chains. For example, Young (1992) examined the materials management departments of 22 general hospitals in the state of Georgia using two approaches such as the multi-criteria performance measurement technique, and data envelopment analysis. Christopher and Marino (1995) also proposed six basic steps for successful reengineering. Through a case study, reengineering steps were proved to double the inventory turnover rate and reduce inventory, labour expense and storage space. Cynthia and Muller (1997) studied the integration of materials management processes using a team model. Huang (1998) classified different types of materials management systems among Taiwanese hospitals by using a fuzzy clustering method. Further, Chow-Chua and Goh (2000) studied how total quality management principles improved the healthcare sector in Singapore.",

Due to the cost savings nature of the recycling of linens, materials management department needs to identify opportunities for a sustainable process in supplying linens. When nurses return the soiled linens to Central Sterilization Services Department (CSSD) for cleaning, sterilizing, repackaging and redistribution to operating theatres and nurse stations, a closed-loop supply chain of linens is formed. Closed-loop supply chain refers to the integration of both forward and reverse supply chain activities (Guide et al., 2003). This study is using a case study where RFID-enabled reengineering is applied in the closed-loop supply chain of the Hospital.

(2002), Lee et al. (2004), and Tellkamp (2003). Potential benefits of RFID in supply chains have been studied by Joshi, 2000, Kang and Gershwin, 2004, Lee et al., 2005, Fleisch and Tellkamp, 2005 and de Kok and Shang (2007) in inventory inaccuracy, bullwhip effect, and optimal procurement policy areas. Their findings indicate inventory inaccuracy in a wide range of processes such as transaction errors, scanning errors, shrinkage errors, supply errors, theft and so on. RFID can improve supply chain performances by increasing inventory availability, reducing inventory levels, saving cost, and improving coordination. Moreover, RFID can deal with the bullwhip effect by reducing the information distortion through data capture and real-time communication properties. Sarac et al. (2010) analysed the impact of RFID on supply chain systems, specially inventory management, by classifying the approaches into four main classes: analytical approach (Lee and Ozer, 2007, Rekik et al., 2007a, Rekik et al., 2007b), simulation approach (Brown et al., 2001, Leung et al., 2007), case studies and experiments (Lefebvre et al., 2006, Wamba et al., 2007, Bottani and Rizzi, 2008). Lee and Ozer (2007) integrated RFID technology with an analytical model on inventory inaccuracy, and observed that RFID can reduce transaction errors by 90%. Kang and Koh (2002) simulated a retailer inventory system using RFID. Leung et al. (2007) also developed a simulation to analyse the impact of RFID on shrinkage errors. Furthermore, Lefebvre et al. (2006) developed a pilot study to analyse RFID deployment in the warehouse. Their findings show that RFID can improve the existing processes and the communication between supply chain actors. Moreover, Ngai et al. (2008) reviewed and classified the literature on RFID technologies that was published between 1995 and 2005. Their study included a content-oriented classification of literature and found that 10.7% of the articles deal with the application of RFID in supply chains. Furthermore, Chao et al.

They gave a perspective to future studies on the impact of RFID technologies on inventory inaccuracy in supply chains. Dolgui and Proth (2008) also focus on the advantages of RFID technologies in inventory management including reduction of shrinkage and theft. However, their survey is based on a limited number of publications and does not contain recent publications. RFID technology offers several benefits to supply chains such as inventory and warehouse management, (Banks et al., 2007, Saygin et al., 2007, Michael and McCathie, 2005). Banks et al. (2007) show a list of qualitative and quantitative factors for RFID implementations. They also conclude that RFID can provide cost reduction and increased revenue. Michael and McCathie (2005) extensively investigated into the pros and cons of RFID technology within an inventory management context, giving businesses the opportunity to weigh up the costs and benefits. Numerous investigators have highlighted that RFID can reduce bullwhip effect and improve supply chain performance (Zaharudin et al., 2006, Saygin et al., 2007, Bottani and Rizzi, 2008, Wang et al., 2008, Zhou, 2009, Agrawal et al., 2009).

He tested different scenarios by varying the degree of information visibility and supply chain actors' collaboration through RFID technologies. The results showed that information visibility and collaboration provide 40\u201370% reduction in inventory costs. He also concluded that the reduction in lost sales improves customer service due to timely order deliveries. Kang and Koh (2002) also simulated a retailer inventory system with an automatic reorder point procurement policy. They show that 2.5% increase of shrinkage can increase stock-out rate by about 50%. Further, Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) simulated a one-product three-level supply chain. They compared two models with and without an inventory level alignment. The results showed that the elimination of inventory inaccuracy can reduce out of stock level and supply chain costs. Basinger (2006) developed a simulation model of a single item, three-level supply chain and studied the impact of inaccuracy on supply chain performance. He concluded that RFID is a new method for real-time alignment of the data that can improve the accuracy of inventory.",

The results obtained show that backorder quantity decreases by 1% and the average inventory increases by 20%. They also observe that RFID can decrease inventory levels. Further, Saygin et al.

Since RFID automates the tracking of medical, linen and equipment supplies, the healthcare organisation can derive significant benefits from RFID applications. For example, speedy transactions through RFID applications could derive a potential cost saving exceeding $2.6 billion per year in the healthcare sector (Jarrett, 1998). Similarly, efficient inventory management through RFID could generate significant saving on healthcare supply chains (Van Vactor, 2008, Raviprakash et al., 2009, Ygal, 2012). Other potential benefits may include effective linkage of patient demand with sourcing, ensuring the timely delivery of medical and non-medical supplies (Acharyulu, 2007, Aguado et al., 2007, Mark, 2011).",

Despite having automation, the department faces a critical issue of poor visibility in the inventory level. This is largely due to the hygiene standard of minimal human contact with soiled linens. When soiled linens are delivered down from the pipes, they are packed into bags for easy collection and accounting. However, this hinders the counting process of individual pieces as it is non-hygienic to open up the bags. The department uses estimates to account for total soiled linens sent out to the sub contractor. This gave rise to poor visibility and hence the inability to track for losses during the cleaning.",

Data will travel the existing methods of transportation, by being pushed through existing systems which are optimized for RFID. The implementation of the linens tracking system will be able to capture the location and data of each item. By capturing the location, the department will be able to keep track of total inventory movement. Also, useful data such as linens expiry, linens usage rate and linens losses can also be analyzed.

Current RFID system is operating within the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) region at 868 MHz 2003. Passive UHF RFID tags are most commonly used in laundry management. These tags allow bulk reading of up to hundreds of tags per second, a read range of up to few meters with no line-of-sight requirements, and operation in harsh environments with storage capacity (96 bits+). Performance improvement of passive UHF RFID tags has been exponential with features such as anti-collision algorithms, improved communication protocols, increased data capacity, dynamic authentication, and ruggedized designs for laundry management. Lines Department uses \u201cSMLD XX\u201d tags from Synometrix and Tagsys HF tags which are rugged waterproof and dry cleaning chemical proof RFID laundry tags with or without center hole for total laundry management and offer high mechanical resistance, and resistance to heat (\u221225 \u00b0C to 150 \u00b0C for 50 h which is within the washing temperatures), and pressure (45 bar). These tags are much smaller (ranging from 15 mm/thickness 2.9 mm) and cheaper than active tags. Primary consideration for the tag design includes the overall size and shape. They operate at the frequency of 13.56 MHz, contain 2 k bits read-write memory, and read 50 tags per second. The casings are made of nylon and polymer which can withstand a water pressure of 45 bar.",

The increase in timing is due to the additional process-Transfer to Conveyor and the station-Conveyor (see Fig. 5). Thus, with a slight trade-off in timing, the process with RFID implementation provides visibility for the soiled linens out to SCORE. The average waiting time for the Open Cage Limit Queue is 44.07 min and is the most time consuming. As the Open Cage Limit is set at a larger value of 90, more time is needed for the Open Cage to be filled and proceed to the next stage.

Moreover, as the chute capacity is set at 50 bags of linen, the average waiting time for the Chute Limit Queue is also time consuming (26.2 min) and has decreased slightly to 25.3 min after RFID implementation.

It is less than the 6300 packed clean linens input, as some of the packed clean linens might be kept in the Shelf and stored, while others might still be in process. Prior to RFID implementation, AGVs delivered the daily linens requirements of the hospital wards and did not account for the unused linens from the wards. This resulted into the department keeping a higher pile level as compared to a replenishment system where the AGVs only needed to replenish the used linens in the wards. Personnel scan when collect linens (after RFID implementation) took a longer average waiting time (273.24 min in Table 4) than personnel collect linens (155.96 min in Table 3) before RFID implementation. The reason for this longer wait time might be due to the newly implemented RFID system. As all personnel need to scan the linens when collecting for patients' usage, they might not be familiar with the new computer interface and process and thus time is lost. Furthermore, the waiting times for metal trolley limit queue has dropped from 9.22 to 5.74 min, for transfer to metal trolley queue has dropped from 78.32 to 35.66 min, and for unload to linen room queue has dropped from 57.17 to 23.7 min after RFID implementation.",

A gap analysis of \u201cexisting\u201d versus \u201creengineered\u201d processes assisted in evaluating the capabilities of RFID to increase productivity through the elimination of search delays from the staff, the linens inventory shrinkage (around 8 linens per day) and recurrent linens shortages, as well as assess the benefits of elimination of costly replacement of lost or stolen linens.
