            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an enveloped, positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA virus belonged to the genus Deltacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (Woo, Huang, Lau, & Yuen, 2010). PDCoV is the causative agent of a newly emerged enteric disease in pigs characterized by watery diarrhoea, dehydration and death with 40%\u201380% mortality following an outbreak (Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016). PDCoV infects enterocytes of the small intestine leading to villous atrophy and malabsorption (Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015). Clinical signs caused by PDCoV resemble those with two viruses in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, including porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Jung et al., 2015), but severity of clinical disease is lesser and piglet mortality is lower. PEDV and TGEV infect pigs of all ages and cause 100% morbidity, with 80%\u2013100% mortality rates in piglets. The higher severity of PEDV and TGEV infection in pigs indicates that the two viruses are more suitable for infecting pigs. On the other hand, PDCoV may not be perfectly adapted to pigs, and the virus may be evolving towards better ability to infect a specific host. Recently, an experimental study in calves suggested that calves are susceptible to infection by PDCoV but not PEDV (Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2017).",

ORF1a and ORF1b, occupying two\u2010thirds of the genome, encode 2 overlapping viral replicase/transcriptase polyproteins, 1a and 1b, which are cleaved into 15 Nsps, namely Nsp2\u201016 (Zhang & Yoo, 2016). The S gene encodes S protein which consists of two domains called S1 and S2 domain. The S1 domain plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptors and contains a neutralizing epitope. The S2 domain functions in membrane fusion (Shang et al., 2018). The E and M genes are transmembrane proteins associated with viral envelope formation and virus release (Woo et al., 2010). On the other hand, the functions of the N gene are associated with viral RNA replication and pathogenesis (Lee & Lee, 2015).",

Although it was first detected, there was no association with clinical disease. The first evidence of PDCoV causing a disease was first evident in Ohio, USA in 2014. Soon after the first emergence in Ohio, USA, the virus was then reported in 18 states (Jung et al., 2016). The rapid widespread of PDCoV was evident when the virus was subsequently reported in China, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam in 2015 (Le et al., 2018; Lee & Lee, 2014; Madapong et al., 2016; Marthaler, Jiang, Collins, & Rossow, 2014; Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014a, 2014b). Although the first detection of PDCoV in those countries was in 2014\u20132015, the retrospective investigation of intestinal samples demonstrated that the presence of PDCoV in China, USA and Thailand was as early as 2004, 2013 and 2013, respectively (Saeng\u2010Chuto, Stott, et al., 2017; Sinha, Gauger, Zhang, Yoon, & Harmon, 2015).",

            "text": "Presently, PDCoV has evolved into three separated groups, including US, China and Southeast Asia (SEA). PDCoV isolates from Thailand and Laos were clustered in a novel PDCoV group, SEA. The SEA group is genetically distinct from US and China PDCoV groups (Madapong et al., 2016; Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al., 2017; Saeng\u2010Chuto, Stott, et al., 2017). In Vietnam, PDCoV was first detected in 2015 (Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al., 2017). Genetic analyses based on S, M, and N genes demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV isolates were genetically different from the SEA group (Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al., 2017). The phylogenetic analyses based on S and M genes demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV is clustered in the SEA group. However, phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene demonstrated contradictory results, since Vietnam PDCoV was clustered in the US group. The findings implied that Vietnam PDCoV could potentially be a recombinant virus. Whether or not this genotype of PDCoV isolates predominantly existing in Vietnam remains not known. We therefore conducted a retrospective study investigating the presence of PDCoV in intestinal samples collected from pigs less than 5 days old experiencing severe diarrhoea, in Vietnam from 2011 to 2016. The full\u2010length genome sequences of the detected Vietnam PDCoV were further characterized on the basis of heterogenicity, and recombination analyses together with virus infectivity in cell culture and pathogenicity in piglets were performed.",

As we mentioned earlier, the Vietnam PDCoV isolated in 2016 (P19_16_VN_0416 and P20_16_VN_0416) shares high degree of genetic similarities and was clustered together with Thai and Lao PDCoV in subgroup SEA\u20101, the virus isolates might be introduced from these neighbouring countries. Secondly, the external introduction of US\u2010related PDCoV was also observed. This introduction seemed to influence the evolution of Vietnam PDCoV as evidenced by chimeric PDCoV in subgroup SEA\u20102. The Vietnam PDCoV isolates detected in 2014 (P12_VN_14_0814) were clustered together with other Vietnam PDCoV isolates, HaNoi6/2015 and Binh21/2015, in subgroup SEA\u20102. The HaNoi6/2014 isolate was detected in Ha Noi province in the northern region of Vietnam since October 2015 and considered as recombinant virus between Thai and China isolates (Le et al., 2018). This study shows the P12_VN_14_0814 isolate shares 100% similarities with the HaNoi6/2014 isolate which means the P12_VN_14_0814 isolate could be also recombinant virus between Thai and China isolates. Interestingly, three of other four isolates in subgroup SEA\u20102 were different. The P29_15_VN_1215, P30_15_VN_1215 and P1_16_VN_0116 isolates were confirmed to be chimeric virus which were a recombination between Vietnam PDCoV (P12_VN_14_0814), the major parent, and US PDCoV (USA/Minnesota159/2014), the minor parent. As previous reports, the recombination in RNA virus occurs when a host cell is infected with at least two viral genomes at the same time and affects host cell tropism, immune evasion, virulence and pathogenesis (Martin et al., 2011; Simon\u2010Loriere & Holmes, 2011). The findings in this study suggested that there are at least four different genome sequences of PDCoV currently circulating in swine farms in Vietnam. The virus may be trying to evolve, adapt to pigs, emerge and cause a disease. It is remained to be seen whether each of four different genome sequence groups would influence the genetic evolution of each other and become a dominant group, or continuously recombine and evolve in the population, resulting in the emergence of a novel viral isolate.",

The results showed that high nt variation was detected in five sites of the full\u2010length genomes. Most nt variations occurred in the ORF1a/1b gene. One of the five sites was found in the S gene which encodes the S protein. The hydrophobicity and antigenicity variations of the S protein were then analysed. Hydrophobicity is associated with protein\u2013protein interaction (e.g. ligand of virus\u2010host receptor binding) and can be changed by replacement with hydrophobic amino acids (Bosch, Zee, Haan, & Rottier, 2003; Tekewe, Connors, Middelberg, & Lua, 2016), and change in antigenicity can affect immune response (Group et al., 2012; He, Li, Heck, Lustigman, & Jiang, 2006). Differences in hydrophobicity and antigenicity were detected in six parts in the S1 domain (aa 1\u2013552) among the five isolates. The S1 domain plays an important role in host receptor binding and contains a neutralizing epitope (Shang et al., 2018; Woo et al., 2010). These results might support the proposition that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolates are evolving towards improved host infection and immune response evasion.",

The viral growth curves were developed and compared to each other. The results showed that the growth curve of chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolate (P29_15_VN_1215) in ST cells was relatively lower compared to the Thai isolate at 12\u201360 hpi. This finding suggested that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolate (P29_15_VN_1215) had less infectivity in ST cells than the Thai isolate.",

The results demonstrated that both PDCoV isolates can induce clinical diseases and pathogenicity in piglets. V/C ratio of piglets infected with chimeric Vietnam PDCoV was reduced but not significant difference compared to those of piglets infected with Thai PDCoV. The PDCoV infectivity results are in line with other studies. In 2015, two PDCoV isolates, OH\u2010FD22 and OH\u2010FD100, were also shown to cause disease. The infected gnotobiotic pigs showed severe diarrhoea, vomiting and severe atrophic enteritis (Jung et al., 2015). Moreover, in 2018, piglets were challenged with PDCoV KNU16\u201007 isolate and showed similar clinical signs, namely diarrhoea, vomiting and viral enteritis (Jang et al., 2018). The findings in our study confirmed that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV infection could induce small intestinal enteritis.",

Recombination analysis demonstrated that isolates in SEA\u20101 were a chimeric virus. P12_14_VN_0814, the first Vietnam isolate, and US PDCoV isolates were major and minor parents, respectively.
