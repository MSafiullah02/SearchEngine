            "text": "Humans alter biodiversity in complex ways; sometimes, human impacts add biodiversity to ecosystems through species introductions or restoration efforts, but in many cases they cause local biotic homogenization and loss of native biodiversity1\u20133. These changes to biodiversity have the potential to affect human and wildlife infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms, and understanding when, where and how this might happen could be important for predicting and mitigating disease outbreaks. Biodiversity\u2013infectious disease interactions have roots as far back as the classic work of Charles Elton4 and have influenced the fields of integrated pest management of crops5. More recently, this topic has generated intense debate in the literature and media, and the question of its generality has become a subject of lively discussion in the discipline of infectious disease ecology6\u201319. Much published research supports the dilution effect hypothesis, which proposes that biodiversity can reduce the abundance of a particular parasite species per host and thus reduce the risk of infectious disease caused by that parasite20\u201323. The dilution effect therefore predicts that biodiversity loss should increase infectious disease burden (with caveats noted below in \u2018Points of agreement and contention\u2019). Other studies support alternatives to the dilution effect, such as no relationship, a context-dependent relationship or an amplification effect6,11\u201314,24\u201326\u2014defined by Keesing et al.27 as the opposite of the dilution effect, or a positive relationship between biodiversity and risk of a particular infectious disease. Debate has also centred on whether managing species composition or biodiversity in general is more effective at reducing risk and whether human diseases are exceptions to general rules about biodiversity\u2013infectious disease associations6,9,13,14,16,17,28\u201330. Hypotheses regarding biodiversity\u2013disease relationships have potentially important public health, management and policy implications, because they imply that changes to biodiversity could increase or decrease disease, thus suggesting that biodiversity conservation could have unaccounted costs or benefits, respectively1,6,11\u201314,20,24\u201326,31. Despite this, there are few examples where biodiversity\u2013disease relationships have been used to set policy or reduce disease burdens. We define biodiversity conservation as preserving functioning ecosystems with predominantly native species and note that this is distinct from single-species conservation or restoration (see Supplementary Information for discussion of restoration and biodiversity augmentation versus biodiversity conservation), which might also affect parasite transmission. The policy and management implications of this debate are real, given that there is a precedent for wildlife management to be used to control disease. For example, based on guidance from ecological models and theory, estate owners in Scotland have culled mountain hares in an attempt to reduce nematode infections in grouse32, and the British government has culled European badgers in an attempt to limit the spread of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis33.",

As individuals with a diversity of perspectives on biodiversity\u2013disease relationships, we joined together to summarize the primary points of contention underlying the debate and to identify potential common ground, building upon several recent reviews of biodiversity\u2013disease relationships13,15,20,31,34,35. We first describe the host\u2013parasite systems that are most likely to be affected by changes to biodiversity. Throughout this Review, \u2018biodiversity\u2019 is generally used to refer to species richness, whereas \u2018species composition\u2019 accounts for the identity or relative frequencies of species in a community. Next, we summarize the points of disagreement in the biodiversity\u2013disease literature. We then describe the state of the science by comparing the results of two recent synthetic statistical analyses of biodiversity\u2013disease relationships. If biodiversity management as a tool for disease control is considered in the broader context of other disease management options, we contend that it could have two primary benefits. First, it might prevent zoonotic and wildlife diseases from becoming problematic where they currently are not. Second, it might provide a means for managing existing diseases where no or few conventional interventions are available. If researchers can agree on this common ground, the resulting scientific and policy clarity could simultaneously improve ecosystem and human health.",

            "text": "Biodiversity is unlikely to increase or decrease directly transmitted, specialist parasites without free-living stages, intermediate hosts or vectors (Figs. 1 and 2). Examples include sexually transmitted diseases of wild vertebrate and human hosts, such as simian and human immunodeficiency viruses, and the causative agents of human tuberculosis, measles, non-pandemic influenza and pneumonia, all of which have few interactions with species other than their host13,14,28 (Fig. 1). By contrast, parasites such as West Nile virus, which can infect humans and numerous species of birds29, the causative agent of Chagas disease, which can infect humans and various wild and domestic animals39,40, the bacterium causing leptospirosis, which is typically transmitted from rat excreta to humans41, and hantavirus, which can infect humans and numerous mammals42\u201344, might be more likely to be influenced by biodiversity31,45. The sensitivity of these parasites to biodiversity also depends on the number and distribution of infectious stages and how they are transmitted (Fig. 1). For example, systems in which potential host contacts are limited\u2014such as vectors that take a limited number of blood meals in their lifetime\u2014are more likely to be affected by host and non-host biodiversity than are parasites that spread billions of infective stages into the environment (but see ref. 46) (Fig. 1). Hence, multi-host parasites, wildlife parasites, parasites with complex life cycles or free-living infectious stages, parasites with generalist vectors, and zoonotic parasites would be predicted to respond most readily to changes to biodiversity (that is, to be biodiversity-responsive parasites; Fig. 1). However, to the extent that biodiversity (1) regulates the density of susceptible wildlife hosts that might then pass directly transmitted parasites amongst themselves27 or (2) influences microbiota that protect against infectious diseases (for example, refs. 20,34,47), some of these expectations will need re-evaluation. Among these diversity-responsive parasites, negative effects of biodiversity on disease risk (that is, prevalence or per-capita parasite abundance) support the dilution effect, positive effects support the amplification effect, and unimodal relationships support both dilution and amplification under different circumstances. Finally, all of these patterns could be sensitive to the biodiversity and disease metrics used and the scale at which they are observed14,48,49.",

Where the diversity of a community falls on these curves is also important, because if most communities fall in the right or left portions of unimodal diversity\u2013disease curves, then dilution or amplification, respectively, will be most common, regardless of the direction of the skew (Fig. 3).

Hence, it is crucial to control for these potentially confounding factors when testing for relationships between biodiversity and disease (for example, ref. 28).

            "text": "In contrast to direct biodiversity\u2013disease relationships, changing species composition, rather than diversity per se, can affect disease risk. This hypothesis states that the presence of certain host species increases or decreases disease, and because many experimental studies manipulate species composition in conjunction with biodiversity, the effects of these factors are difficult to disentangle51,52,55. Species vary in their diluting and amplifying capacity based on their abundance, susceptibility and transmission potential, and thus certain species can disproportionately affect disease risk56. However, there is also support for biodiversity in general affecting disease, particularly when changes in diversity are substitutive\u2014that is, adding new species to a community reduces the abundance of existing species (for example, refs. 57\u201360). If species composition rather than diversity per se has a large effect on disease, then managing particular species might be more effective than managing overall biodiversity. Some species, including many rodents, thrive in communities with few predatory species and thus low overall diversity: communities in which many zoonotic diseases can be amplified10. However, adding or sustaining top predator species in a community without increasing or maintaining biodiversity, respectively, could be difficult for predators that require an ample abundance and diversity of prey species. This observation that low-diversity communities contain a nested subset of their higher-diversity counterparts57 is an example of how diversity and species composition can be correlated20 (see \u2018Research frontiers\u2019 section). This correlation makes it challenging to disentangle composition from diversity in nature and to manage composition independent of biodiversity. Importantly, however, this correlation can make it easier to manage diseases than if diversity and composition were related to one another idiosyncratically, because managing diversity will de facto result in management of composition20 (see \u2018Research frontiers\u2019 section).",

However, decades of literature on the dilution effect hypothesized explicit mechanisms23,50,52, and empirical support is growing for several of these. For example, communities with greater biodiversity might have greater densities of non-competent hosts, which can dilute disease by reducing encounters with vectors (for example, wasted bites)27, competing with competent hosts and reducing their densities44,49, or consuming free-living parasites or infected hosts (if the parasites are not trophically transmitted) (for example, refs. 58,59). When controlling for parasite exposure, traits of individual species may be predictive of whether they are likely to be a competent (amplifying) or non-competent (diluting) host for a focal parasite, including phylogenetic relatedness to focal hosts36,63\u201365, life history and immunity or other defence strategies66\u201370, numerical abundance63,64,71, predilection to consume parasites relative to hosts58,59, and contact rates or connectedness within communities72. Alternatively, increasing biodiversity might theoretically increase the density of competent hosts, which amplify parasite burden by increasing rates of parasite or vector reproduction, by serving as long-lived reservoirs of infection, or by having high contact rates with other hosts73.",

Community assembly can range from substitutive, in which individuals of a new species replace individuals of existing species in a community, to additive, in which adding new species adds more individuals to a community. Often, both substitutive and additive assembly occur within a community, because systems typically start assembling additively and shift to substitutive assembly as niches become more fully occupied and competition increases76.",

For example, when community (dis)assembly is additive, amplification is expected because host densities increase as new host species are added to a community. When community (dis)assembly is substitutive, amplification can occur when the addition of individuals of new, competent host species reduce the density of less competent host species27,50,52. Amplification or dilution can occur when competent hosts or non-competent hosts, respectively, are added to or subtracted from communities via the sampling effect (that is, more diverse communities are more likely to contain a host species that either strongly increases or decreases disease) (for example, ref. 77). Additionally, the overall burden of multiple diseases might increase through the cumulative effect of greater pathogen diversity78. If considering the cumulative effects of all pathogen species on a host population, host diversity could decrease the disease burden of individual pathogens (dilution) while simultaneously increasing the combined burden of all pathogens (see \u2018Extrapolations beyond collected data\u2019 section for further discussion and counter examples). Although this mechanism for an increase in disease is important for individual health, it would not meet the traditional definition of amplification27, which focuses on the prevalence or abundance of individual pathogen species in hosts, not the combined effects of all pathogens or an increase in pathogen richness.",

            "text": "Dilution should predominate when community disassembly is substitutive and competent hosts are abundant or are resilient to biodiversity loss. We focus on community disassembly because most of the literature on the dilution effect assumes biodiversity loss and thus disassembly. A commonly hypothesized mechanism for dilution assumes that: (1) parasites experience greater selection to infect abundant rather than rare hosts; (2) abundant hosts make considerable investments into reproduction, growth, and/or dispersal that might come at the expense of defences against parasites; (3) abundant hosts are more likely to colonize and less likely to be extirpated from ecosystems; and (4) adding rare hosts reduces the abundance of common host species in high-diversity communities50,70. When these assumptions are met, a right-skewed biodiversity\u2013disease relationship should result (Fig. 3), and abundant and widespread hosts might be amplifying hosts, while hosts with greater diluting potential would be added to communities as biodiversity increases, or would be lost from communities when they become fragmented or disturbed7,34,76,79. A combination of mesocosm experiments and field surveys demonstrates that the most abundant and widespread amphibian hosts are also the most competent hosts for a parasitic trematode species, supporting the notion that community disassembly processes function in a manner consistent with the dilution effect for this parasite57. Similarly, community disassembly processes support dilution effects documented for Lyme disease20,45,55,74. In a recent study, when plant communities were (dis)assembled randomly, dilution was not observed, but when they (dis)assembled naturally, biodiversity significantly reduced disease, again highlighting the potential importance of natural assembly processes80. Nevertheless, the generality of this dilution mechanism remains unclear, in part because the frequency with which natural communities assemble and disassemble in a substitutive versus additive manner is not well characterized. Although we call for additional work, we emphasize that substantial progress has been made on mechanisms underlying biodiversity\u2013disease relationships.",

For example, there are several links in the hypothesized causal chain connecting high vertebrate diversity to a high probability of zoonotic disease establishment and transmission in humans20, but not all of these pathways have strong scientific support10. There is considerable support for the argument that host diversity begets parasite diversity26,81\u201384. However, there is not consistent support for the hypothesis that increasing parasite diversity increases disease burden10. In fact, recent experimental work on wildlife and plants diseases57,78,85 showed that higher pathogen diversity can be associated with lower disease severity of individual pathogens in both plants85 and animals78. Ultimately, the impact of parasite species diversity on the health of hosts will depend on how the additional parasite species affect disease burden and severity (see \u2018Research frontiers\u2019 section).",

            "text": "The dependence of dilution and amplification on spatial scale has been a common thread throughout the biodiversity\u2013disease debate11,12,35. There are two main ways in which scale might influence the relationship between biodiversity and disease. First, Johnson et al.34 proposed that any relationship between biodiversity and infectious disease should be strongest at local scales and weaken at larger scales. This prediction arises because species interactions affecting dilution and amplification occur at relatively small spatial scales, whereas abiotic factors like climate tend to dominate as drivers of biological pattern at larger spatial scales. Cohen et al.48 found support for this hypothesis in the amphibian chytrid fungus, West Nile virus and the bacterium that causes Lyme disease: at small spatial scales, host richness was a significant predictor of disease prevalence, whereas at larger spatial scales, the distribution of pathogens was more strongly influenced by climate and human population density48. Second, it is possible that the diluting capacity of a non-competent host might be most observable at small scales, where encounter reduction can occur, whereas the amplifying effect of a competent host might be most observable at larger temporal and spatial scales73. For example, for vector-transmitted diseases, removing a competent host can initially increase vector abundance on alternative hosts, suggesting a dilution effect, while over longer time and larger spatial scales, the removal of the competent host can ultimately cause decreases in the vector population73. Importantly, these results suggest that at least some of the variation in outcomes across biodiversity\u2013disease studies could be a product of variation in the scales at which studies were conducted and at which mechanisms operate (see \u2018Synthesizing the evidence\u2019 and \u2018Research frontiers\u2019 sections). Indeed, biodiversity\u2013disease studies have occurred from global to local scales6,81,86, while conservation actions and public health interventions generally occur at intermediate scales within countries6,28,86. In general, the most relevant studies are those conducted at temporal scales long enough to encompass pathogen life cycles and at spatial scales that are most relevant to both biodiversity\u2013disease interactions and conservation, which are generally at the local to regional scales35.",

Negative diversity\u2013disease associations were equally strong for zoonotic and wildlife diseases, and the meta-analysis did not reveal any significant context dependencies17, nor evidence of publication bias for zoonotic diseases18, though it is possible that null and amplification effects are underrepresented in the literature (that is, system selection rather than publication bias) (Table 1). Additionally, although Civitello et al.17 did not explicitly quantify the scale of the studies in their meta-analysis, there were no significant differences in effect sizes between smaller-scale experimental and larger-scale correlative field studies, indicating that, within the range of scales at which the studies were conducted, scale was unlikely to affect the nature or strength of dilution effects17,18. These results suggest that, among the diseases for which relationships with biodiversity have been tested, a negative association (1) is frequently reported for wildlife and human diseases, (2) is robust across ecological contexts, and (3) is consistent across the spatial scales studied and between experimental and observational studies. However, many important human parasites have not been studied under these conditions and therefore could not be included in this meta-analysis, and many of the studies in the meta-analysis quantified infection prevalence or parasite abundance rather than disease burden (Table 1). Finally, in a meta-analytic framework, it is difficult to separate effects of species composition (for example, sampling effects) from effects of biodiversity per se, although the meta-analysis included several studies that did separate these effects.",

To do so, Wood et al.28 conducted a global analysis investigating across-country associations between disease burden (disability adjusted life years; DALYs) and biodiversity (country-level bird and mammal species densities), while controlling for other potential drivers of disease burden, such as wealth, forestation and urbanization. All vector-borne or zoonotic diseases (that is, biodiversity-responsive) examined in this study were positively associated with biodiversity at the across-country scale, though only five of the associations were statistically significant. By contrast, when considering changes in biodiversity and disease burden over time within each country, coefficients for seven diseases were negative (one significantly), and four were positive (one significantly). Thus, biodiversity effects were less positive at the within-country scale, relative to comparisons among countries28. Because the study is global, it relies on country-scale estimates of biodiversity, which include species not directly relevant to each disease (for example, total bird diversity in disease systems for which only mammals can become infected) (Table 1). Additionally, the spatial scale of analysis (intermediate-size countries) is larger than the scale at which species interactions occur, but is a scale at which some policy decisions are made.",

In fact, the median replicate size for studies on zoonotic parasites in Civitello et al.17, as compiled by Halliday and Rohr88 (for studies with \u22653 biodiversity levels and rounding all replicate sizes to the nearest order of magnitude), was 1.5 km2, whereas the median replicate size for the analyses in Wood et al.28 was 321,489 km2. As discussed above, the association between biodiversity and chytrid, West Nile, and Lyme disease declined with spatial scale in multiple regression analyses48, consistent with the notion that mechanisms for dilution might operate at smaller scales than mechanisms for amplification. Clearly, the role of spatial scale in affecting the net effect of diversity on disease requires more attention.",

Any disease designated as biodiversity-responsive by Wood et al.28 was considered biodiversity-responsive for this re-analysis. We conducted a general mixed-effects linear model in which we treated as the response variable their 11 pairs of regression coefficients (one for the across-space comparison and one for the across-time comparison) for the effect of biodiversity on human disease burden of biodiversity-responsive diseases, with time versus space as the predictors, and the disease identity as a random effect (coefficients taken from the full model; see Fig. 1 of ref. 28). The positive coefficient between biodiversity and disease decreased significantly when transitioning from the across-country global comparison to the within-country, across-time comparison (F1,10 = 13.59, P = 0.0042, Fig. 4), from significantly positive at the cross-country global scale to non-significant at the within-country scale over time. This re-analysis of the Wood et al.28 study suggests that when spatial scale is reduced from across to within countries (by considering a single country over time), biodiversity\u2013disease relationships become less positive (Fig. 4). However, numerous other important factors differ between the Wood et al.28 and Civitello et al.17 studies (Table 1). For example, most studies in Civitello et al.17 assessed parasite prevalence or abundance, whereas Wood et al.28 analysed DALYs, which represent the burden of infection rather than parasite presence or abundance. Thus, for several reasons, we cannot definitively attribute differences in effect size and magnitude to differences in scale (Table 1).",

Ecosystems regularly pose a threat of disease to humans and wildlife, but ecosystems vary in these threats. Thus, targeting conservation toward protecting ecosystems that are not currently posing a major threat of problematic disease to humans or wildlife might prevent increases in disease (Fig. 2). In contrast, when the goal is to manage a specific disease whose ecology is reasonably well understood, it may be simpler and more effective to manage the particular species (vectors or amplifying or diluting hosts) or habitats that are known to decrease or increase disease (for example, through vaccination, culling, predator supplementation and habitat manipulation) than to conserve biodiversity in general (Fig. 2). However, management of particular species or habitats might only be effective against a focal pathogen. By contrast, preservation of intact, functioning ecosystems and finding sustainable, equitable interventions that discourage human incursions into those ecosystems (for example, for logging and bush-meat hunting), could reduce the risk of transmission of multiple pathogens, even if these interventions are not the single most efficient control method for individual diseases. Thus, they could represent win\u2013win scenarios for conservation and disease control.",

Just as importantly, there are many reasons to conserve, restore and manage biodiversity that are unrelated to infectious disease, including other ecosystem services as well as ethical, aesthetic and cultural motivations.

We submit that the field needs to diversify, by both developing a broader understanding of biodiversity\u2013disease patterns (that is, testing associations between biodiversity and disease beyond the disease agents that are already well studied) and narrowing in on the processes (that is, the mechanisms) that generate these patterns. A few macro-ecological investigations of biodiversity\u2013disease pattern have already been conducted at the global scale (for example, refs. 26,28,86), but there is substantial promise in adopting this approach at regional or local spatial scales, which could reveal the conditions under which biodiversity\u2013disease relationships are ecologically influential48. To discover what drives these ecologically influential relationships, experimental studies are needed to isolate mechanisms. For instance, most of the mechanisms posited to explain the dilution effect involve substitutive community (dis)assembly, but it remains unclear how often community (dis)assembly is additive versus substitutive, how strongly this affects biodiversity\u2013disease relationships, and whether the most competent hosts for infections are also the most robust to biodiversity loss under historical and current conditions20,31,34,75,90. The degree of correlation between species composition and biodiversity and the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic community assembly mechanisms are also not well established. The less deterministic community assembly is, the less effective biodiversity management might be as a tool for disease control. Finally, ecological communities can also change stochastically through time (that is, ecological drift), which could cause temporal shifts in the roles of different dilution mechanisms at a given location.",

Like disease, biodiversity can also be measured or represented in many ways and this too has the potential to affect outcomes91. For instance, whether alpha, beta or gamma diversity affect disease differently is uncertain. Moreover, different subsets of biodiversity might have different effects on disease. For example, it remains unclear how parasite diversity affects the number of infections per host or disease78,85. Additionally, natural enemies of parasites (for example, predators58), symbionts of hosts (for example, host microbiomes47), and other non-host species can influence biodiversity\u2013disease relationships, but the common mechanisms by which non-hosts affect infectious disease remain equivocal27,34,58.",

There is a rich literature on the scale-dependent effects of ecological drivers on biodiversity patterns91. Can it inform the biodiversity\u2013disease discipline? More specifically, recent work shows that species composition often changes when it is measured at different spatial scales, and that measures of biodiversity are therefore often uncorrelated across scales94. Can this phenomenon, coupled with neutral sampling effects, cause different biodiversity\u2013disease patterns to emerge at different scales? How important is the temporal scale of community assembly in revealing novel mechanisms linking host diversity to disease95?",

Not surprisingly, many questions and considerable work remain on the application of biodiversity management to public health. For instance, some studies suggest mutual interference among co-infecting pathogens, such that an increase in parasite diversity generally decreases overall infections75. What is the general shape of the response surface for the relationships among disease and per-capita parasite diversity and abundance, and what are the public health trade-offs between more cases of one disease versus more different types of parasitic infections? How large is the unique effect of biodiversity compared to the unique effect of factors that commonly co-vary with biodiversity loss due to habitat conversion to more urban settings, such as increases in sanitation, access to health care and area of impervious surfaces? What are the trade-offs of investing in conservation as a disease management approach versus other public health interventions?",

First, biodiversity should have a greater effect on multi-host, wildlife, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, especially those parasites with complex life cycles and free-living stages, than on directly transmitted, host-specialist diseases. Second, the relationship between biodiversity and disease can be nonlinear, and identifying the shape of these relationships and where the diversity of a community falls on this continuum is critical for understanding when decreasing biodiversity will increase, decrease or have no effect on disease risk. Third, not all diseases are equal. Ebola is not the same as head lice, and from a conservation perspective, a disease causing widespread extirpations or extinctions is different from one that is not consistently causing wildlife declines. Fourth, biodiversity\u2013disease relationships may be scale-dependent. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie this possible scale dependency could lead to insights into which management targets (biodiversity, particular species and human behaviour) and which scales of action are most effective for disease control. Outcomes with co-benefits for biodiversity and human health should be actively sought. Establishing consensus on these guiding principles will help to set a research and policy agenda for simultaneously improving ecosystem and human health.",

However, to the extent that biodiversity regulates susceptible hosts27 and diverse microbiomes protect against infectious diseases (for example, refs. 20,34,47), some of these expectations will need re-evaluation.

If dilution occurs more frequently than amplification, we postulate that the value of general biodiversity conservation might be to prevent: (1) multi-host, zoonotic and wildlife diseases from becoming problematic; (2) diseases where specific key hosts are hard to manage; and (3) diseases where little is known about their ecology, because too little is known to hone any intervention to specific species. In contrast, when the key hosts are manageable, interventions might be targeted to specific species or habitats that are known to amplify or dilute disease, which might make the intervention more effective than general biodiversity conservation. To the extent that biodiversity regulates the density of susceptible hosts that might then pass directly transmitted pathogens amongst themselves27 or influences microbiota that protect against infectious diseases (for example, refs. 20,34,47), some of these hypotheses will need re-evaluation.

An asymptotic distribution suggests that amplification becomes increasingly moderate with biodiversity.

Hedges\u2019 g was provided by Civitello et al.17, whereas Wood et al.28 provided standardized regression coefficients.

To properly account for the lack of independence among multiple effect sizes within studies and for the same diseases in Civitello et al.17, we calculated a mean effect size for each study weighting by the inverse of the variance, and then used inverse variance weighting on those study-wise means to obtain a weighted mean for each disease (see Source Data Fig. 4 for data used to generate this figure). In the Wood et al.28 study, the cross-country coefficient is significantly greater than zero (z = 5.82, P < 0.001), whereas the within-country (over time) coefficient is negative but not significantly different from zero (z = \u20131.20, P = 0.116). However, the relationship between these mean coefficients and scale is significantly positive (F1,10 = 13.59, P = 0.0042), indicating that positive diversity\u2013disease associations are more likely for among-country comparisons than for comparisons within a country, over time. Relative to Wood et al.28, smaller-scale studies compiled in Civitello et al.17 were more likely to find negative diversity\u2013disease associations. However, other factors also differ between the Wood et al.28 and Civitello et al.17 studies so we cannot confidently attribute all of this difference to the effect of scale. The midline of each boxplot is the median, the lower and upper limits of the box are first and third quartiles, respectively, the whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the circles are extreme data points. Note that one extreme Hedges\u2019 g value from Civitello et al.17 at \u20134.92 (Leptospira spp.) is not shown but was used to calculate the median, quartiles and whiskers of the boxplot.
