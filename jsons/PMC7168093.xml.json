We believe it is very unlikely that our patients had unrecognized PID. None of these patients had strong identifiers of PID, such as failure to thrive or intravenous antimicrobial use prior to ALL diagnosis.10 Patient B did have a distant family history of RAG2 deficiency but she did not carry this mutation. Investigations prior to starting chemotherapy suggested patients A, B, and C had been exposed to viral infections with no major complications. Finally, Patient E had an extensive genetic workup excluding common SCID mutations and Patients A and C had normal TREC assays. Based on the described history and investigations, we concluded these were secondary immunodeficiencies produced by the chemotherapy.",

Normal thymic involution does not begin until approximately 7 years of age.4 Thymic enlargement post chemotherapy has been demonstrated in pediatric patients.6 In most children treated for standard\u2010risk and high\u2010risk ALL, CD4+, and CD8+ T\u2010cells require 3\u201318 months to recover and the CD3+ count at 1 month was greater than 300 cells/\u03bcl regardless of treatment intensity.5, 6 Despite these prolonged impairments in immune function, severe opportunistic infections are not typically appreciated after cessation of chemotherapy, and death from infection is rare.13 These T\u2010cell recovery patterns were not seen in our patients.",
