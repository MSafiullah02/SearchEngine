Values of R0 can impact on the degree of correlation between pn and k, making the prediction of the presence or absence of SSEs more variable. For R0, our estimates (0.48 - 0.70) were much lower than those in China (2.20-2.68) [4, 5]. The observed smaller R0 in HK, JP and SG may be due to the early enactment of social distancing interventions [6] or the high level of adoption of personal protective measures [7]. However, for given values of R0, k and the final cluster size, increasing numbers of new infections increase the chance of observing clusters of epidemiologically-linked cases (Figure S2). We should therefore be cautious about the emergence of SSEs due to the increasing number of cases as COVID-19 progresses.",

Governments have enacted different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). HK, SG and JP have avoided crowding (such as mandatory cancellation of mass gatherings), closed schools, conducted contact tracing and quarantined seemingly healthy individuals exposed to COVID-19 [6]. Both HK and SG enacted social distancing as soon as cases were first reported in the regions; while JP initiated these measures when the local cases reached 163 (excluding the international conveyance) in late February 2020 [6]. With possible transmission in the community, stay-at-home order becomes a core social distancing measure, which confines SARS-CoV-2 within households at the expense of increased risk of infection among household members, particularly in the dense migrant dormitory in SG. Therefore, setting-wide wearing of face masks is recommended for cramped residential areas [8]. Besides the community, nosocomial outbreaks are possible as foretold by the past experience in SARS [1] and featured by the containment delay after hospitalization experienced by COVID-19 cases [9]. Therefore, heightened measures in isolating suspected inpatients should be enforced in hospitals.",

Therefore, determining the optimal set of NPIs remains a challenge. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases following the lifting of NPIs may prompt the emergence of SSEs, triggering a cascade of infections which are difficult to interrupt. To this end, further research is warranted to unravel predictors for SSEs, such as older age as observed in other diseases [1].",
