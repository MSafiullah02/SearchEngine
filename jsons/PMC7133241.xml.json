            "text": "Excluding other probable mechanisms of transmission can be challenging, especially in the neonatal period. The organisms that are a concern for transmission through breastfeeding are transmitted more commonly prenatally, perinatally, and postnatally through other mechanisms. Congenital infection can occur in any trimester, depending on the organism. The timing of infection also significantly affects the clinical course of the infection in the fetus or newborn (eg, asymptomatic, fetal demise, prematurity, clinical disease present at birth, or late presentation). Perinatal infections commonly occur from exposure to blood or body fluids and contact with pathogens from the maternal genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. The likelihood that the exposed infant will be infected varies significantly with the specific organism and various host factors (eg, passively acquired antibody levels in the infant). Postnatally acquired infections are transmitted most commonly through contact with caregivers (eg, parents, relatives, visitors, health care providers), the environment (eg, medical equipment, other fomites), or breast milk, depending on the organism [12].",

In most infectious situations, the exposure of the infant and mother to child transmission has occurred before the illness is diagnosed in the mother (eg, measles, Coxsackievirus infection) and frequently occurs before the mother becomes ill (eg, chickenpox, hepatitis). Proscribing breastfeeding at that point may not prevent infection in the infant and will diminish significantly the effect of breast milk to limit or modify the illness in the infant. The timing of the infection in the mother can influence significantly the risks to the infant (eg, primary HIV or CMV infection before pregnancy, during pregnancy, or postnatally, ie, during lactation).",

Standard precautions include avoiding direct contact with blood and body fluids, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes of every patient, regardless of the patient's diagnosis, based on the idea that infection can be transmitted without an identified infection and from unidentified sources. Standard precautions emphasize careful handwashing with every patient contact and the use of appropriate barriers when contamination with body fluids is more likely (eg, gloves, masks, glasses). Breast milk is not considered a potentially infectious body fluid under these guidelines. Careful handwashing before and after breastfeeding is always appropriate, as are selected barriers (mask, gown or clothes, bandages) to prevent infant contact with other body fluids of the mother with a specific infection. Washing the breast before or after breastfeeding is unnecessary and may irritate the breast.",

Because infants cannot wear such devices, infants of mothers with these infections should be separated temporarily from the mother during the infectious period, regardless of the mode of feeding.

Additional gram-negative bacilli are resistant frequently to antibiotics, and Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative strains become more frequent, especially during hospitalization of a neonate or infant.

Botulism is caused by the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Arnon and colleagues [18] reviewed 50 patients hospitalized for botulism in California and the breast-fed infants were older at diagnosis than formula-fed infants, and had milder disease. In cases of sudden infant death syndrome associated with botulism, no infants were breast-fed within 10 weeks of death. An association with the introduction of solid foods has been suggested. Honey and corn syrup often are implicated because they may contain C botulinum spores. The apparent immunologic benefit of breast milk may be caused by more acidic stools (pH 5.1\u20135.4) and increased Bifidobacterium species in the stools of breast-fed infants, limiting the presence of C botulinum or spores. Botulinum toxin production declines with lower pH. No evidence suggests that the organism or the toxin is transmitted through breast milk.",

Postnatal contact with mothers, health care workers, and contaminated, unpasteurized, banked breast milk were the identified sources of infection [23]. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of mastitis in the mother. There is one reported case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in an infant whose mother had a skin lesion caused by staphylococcus on her areola [24]. No attempt to identify the toxin or the organism in the breast milk was made. This case reinforces close, continued observation of the infant (breast- or formula-fed) when there is a documented maternal infection. In a case of toxic shock syndrome in a mother at 22 hours postpartum, the breast-fed infant remained well through 60 days of age. Staphylococcal enterotoxin F (SEF) was identified in breast milk on days 5, 8, and 11, but Staphylococcus aureus was isolated only from the mother's vagina and not the breast milk [25]. SEF is inactivated by pepsin at pH 4.5. It is probably inactivated in the stomach, presenting no risk to the infant. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is more frequent than in the past. Skin and nares are the predominant sites of colonization. No treatment regimen to eradicate colonization has proved highly successful. Current regimens include oral systemic therapy with one or two sensitive antibiotics, topical antibiotics twice daily to the nares, and intermittent bathing with hexachlorophene (pHisoHex) or a similar agent.

The revised guidelines proposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics committees on Infectious Diseases and the Fetus and Newborn use several variables to identify increased risk for GBS infection in the neonate and recommend intrapartum prophylaxis for those infants at high risk [26]. Colonization of the infant during the postnatal period occurs [27], [28]. Although many infants are colonized, few develop disease [29]. Acquisition of GBS through breastfeeding or breast milk is rare, but has been documented in cases of late-onset GBS disease [30], [31]. Butter and DeMoor [32] demonstrated GBS in the nose and throat of infants when GBS also was cultured from the mother's breast. It is more likely that transmission occurs through contact rather than the organism passing in the breast milk. A mother or infant colonized or infected with GBS should be managed with standard precautions during hospitalization. Routine culturing of the breast or breast milk and therapy to eradicate colonization have not proved useful. GBS has not been associated with outbreaks in the nursery. When the mother begins treatment for GBS disease (most often endometritis), temporary, 24-hour separation of the mother and infant should occur with the provision of expressed breast milk for the infant.",

Congenital TB is extremely rare, with fewer than 300 reported cases in the literature. TB mastitis is also rare. Starke [33] has summarized the evaluation and treatment of a pregnant woman with a positive tuberculin skin test. The primary concern is the postnatal exposure of the infant through droplets or droplet nuclei by the mother or another household member with active pulmonary TB. Complete evaluation of the suspected person to determine their TB status (active disease with or without positive cultures and smears) and testing of all household contacts are the first steps. Breast-fed and formula-fed infants are equally at risk from respiratory transmission. Separation of the infant from any case of active pulmonary TB is appropriate. Once adequate therapy in the mother has begun and the mother is determined to not be infectious, the infant and mother may have contact. Observation of the mother and infant should continue through the completion of treatment for the mother. Transmission of TB in breast milk has never been documented in the absence of TB mastitis. Expressed breast milk can be given safely to the infant because antituberculous medications can be used in infants. The only contraindication to using breast milk is in the mother who has TB mastitis. Prophylactic isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid) therapy for the infant prevents TB infection in infants. Once both the mother and infant are being treated and closely observed, they can be in contact [34].",

The transmission of infection through breast milk is well documented for CMV, HIV1, and HTLV-I. Exposure to small amounts of virus in human milk multiple times a day over the period of breastfeeding (months to years) probably contributes to the high rate of transmission of CMV, HIV1, and HTLV-I through breast milk.

Approximately 1% of all infants excrete CMV in their urine at or soon after birth (less than 3 weeks of age). About 5% of the CMV congenitally infected infants will manifest disease at birth and 15% will manifest congenital infection later (eg, progressive late-onset hearing loss, learning disability) [35]. Perinatal infection occurs through direct contact or body fluid contact at delivery, but is associated rarely with clinical illness in full-term infants. Postnatal infection occurs through breastfeeding or contact with infected body fluids, most frequently during play with other infants, especially in day-care settings. Infection through breast milk rarely results in significant disease in full-term infants. The normal acquisition of transplacental maternal antibodies against CMV protects full-term infants of CMV-positive mothers. Rarely, primary CMV infection occurs in the mother around delivery or during lactation, which increases the risk for illness in the infant because of a lack of anti-CMV antibodies available to the infant. CMV is identifiable in breast milk at various rates in CMV-positive mothers, probably because of variation in the testing and sampling techniques and the intermittent nature of reactivation and excretion of the virus. Postnatal exposure of susceptible infants (ie, infants without passively acquired maternal antibodies against CMV: premature infants, infants of CMV-seronegative mothers, and immunodeficient infants) can lead to severe disease (hepatitis, pneumonitis) [36], [37].",

Transmission occurs through blood and blood products, intravenous drug use, probably body fluids contaminated with blood, and sexual transmission when there are other STDs or a high viral load in blood or body fluids. Congenital and intrapartum transmission occurs. Factors that seem to increase risk for such transmission include high maternal viral load, maternal coinfection with HIV, and prolonged rupture of membranes with vaginal delivery [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53]. The frequency and the easy diagnosis of HCV infection in infants still need to be worked out. Transmission of HCV infection through breast milk has not been proved, and transmission rates seem similar in formula-fed and breast-fed infants. Published studies have not controlled for variables such as maternal HCV-RNA serum viral loads, amount of virolactia, exclusive or partial breastfeeding versus exclusive formula feeding, and duration of breastfeeding [45], [46], [47], [51], [52], [53], [54]. Additional controlled trials are needed to delineate the importance of different factors contributing to or limiting transmission from mother to child. Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines do not consider maternal HCV infection a contraindication to breastfeeding, although they suggest that cracked or bleeding nipples may increase risk for transmission [55]. Regardless of the etiologic cause of maternal hepatitis (A, B, or C), the theoretic risks for transmission through breast milk should be discussed balanced with the benefits of breast milk, so the mother and parents can make an informed decision concerning infant feeding.",

Many issues related to HIV1 transmission through breast milk are considered, including the increased risk for transmission with primary HIV1 infection in the mother during lactation, the health of the HIV1-infected, breastfeeding mother, the presence of the virus and potentially immunologically protective factors in colostrum and breast milk, factors that contribute to HIV1 transmission in breast milk, and possible interventions to prevent or limit HIV1 transmission through breast milk.

Some of the potentially effective interventions include exclusive breastfeeding, early weaning, education and support to decrease the occurrence of mastitis or nipple lesions, antiretroviral therapy for the mother or infant, treating the human milk to decrease the viral burden (ultraviolet light, freezing, and thawing), and stimulating the infant's immune defenses with active or passive immunization. These interventions need to be tested for feasibility, cultural acceptability, preservation of nutritional benefit, and efficacy where they may have the greatest effect. Avoidance of breastfeeding by HIV-positive mothers should continue in countries where an alternative source of nutrition can be provided easily. The World Health Organization, United Nations International Children's Fund, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS recommend counseling, education, and support for HIV-infected mothers in resource-poor settings where breastfeeding is the norm, and offer vital nutritional and infection-protective effects so they can make an educated decision concerning infant feeding. Mothers making either choice should be provided continuing education, support, and medical care to optimize their infant's and their own health and to minimize the risk of HIV1 mother-to-child transmission.",

Early life infection carries the greatest risk for adult T-cell leukemia [62]. HTLV-I occurs endemically in limited areas worldwide, including southwest Japan, the Caribbean, South America, and sub-Saharan Africa [65], [66]. Transmission is through sexual contact, blood and blood products, and breast milk. Transmission occurs more frequently in breast-fed infants than formula-fed infants [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72]. A longer duration of breastfeeding correlates with greater risk for HTLV-I transmission to the infant [72], [73], [74]. Transmission also has been associated with higher maternal provirus levels and a higher HTLV-I antibody titer [75], [76]. Complete avoidance of breastfeeding is an effective intervention to prevent mother-to-child transmission [77]. The median time of transmission was estimated at 11 to 12 months of age [78]. In areas of low prevalence, the likelihood of a false positive HTLV-I test is high; therefore repeat testing often is indicated. In a pregnant woman, antibody titer testing and proviral load quantification are appropriate to estimate the risk for transmission to the infant. The risk for mother-to-child transmission should be discussed with the mother and parents. When formula is available readily and culturally acceptable, then avoiding breast milk or recommending early weaning (before or at 6 months of age) is reasonable to decrease the risk for HTLV-I transmission to the infant. Providing the infant with frozen/thawed breast milk may be an acceptable alternative in certain situations, because freezing decreases the amount of viable virus in breast milk for other viruses (eg, CMV, HIV1).",

Transmission is through contact with respiratory secretions (droplets, saliva) and less commonly other body fluids (blood and urine). Seroprevalence data show peak parvovirus infection occurring in school-age children. There is no evidence for parvovirus transmission through breast milk in humans, although it has been identified in rat milk.

In adults, it primarily causes a mild upper respiratory tract infection. There is no evidence of congenital or perinatal infections.

Premature infants and neonates with underlying respiratory disease (hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or pulmonary hypertension associated with cardiac disease have greater morbidity and mortality with RSV infection. These at-risk infants should receive prophylaxis with either palivizumab (Synagis) or RSV immunoglobulin\u2013intravenous, regardless of the mode of infant feeding. There is no evidence for transmission of RSV through breast milk. There is considerable debate over the measurable benefit of breastfeeding in modifying this disease in neonates. Published studies demonstrate conflicting data about the potential benefit, perhaps because of difficulties controlling for confounding variables (eg, crowding and smoking) [88], [89], [90]. Breastfeeding with RSV disease in the mother or the infant can continue as tolerated, and expressed breast milk can be used if the infant is unable to suckle because of respiratory distress.",

Perinatal infection can be severe when the mother presents with the rash of chickenpox between 5 days before delivery and 2 days after delivery. The severity of the infant's illness may be caused by transmission of the virus to the fetus during maternal viremia before formation and transfer of adequate antibodies to the infant in this narrow window. Postnatal transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and contact or aerosolization of virus from the skin lesions of either varicella or zoster. VZV DNA and antibody against VZV have been identified in breast milk [91], [92]. One case of suspected transmission of VZV has been reported without adequate proof to exclude the more common modes of transmission [92]. If a mother develops varicella, breast-fed and formula-fed infants are equally at risk from close contact with her. They should be separated from her and cared for by another individual during the mother's rash (period of infectivity). Expressed breast milk can be given to the infant if no skin lesions involve the breasts or as soon as varicella-zoster immunoglobulin has been given to the infant.",

Many topical and systemic antifungal agents are recommended in different regimens to treat and eradicate Candida spp in the breastfeeding mother\u2013infant dyad.

One case of tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant was reported in 2004. The vaccinee in the household developed an appropriate reaction at the inoculation site and subsequently his wife developed vesicles on both areolae (secondary contact vaccinia). The breastfeeding infant later developed lesions on her philtrum, cheek, and tongue. The mother and infant were observed closely and remained well. Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing identified vaccinia virus in the mother and infant's lesions, but the breast milk was not tested [102]. Secondary contact vaccinia from smallpox vaccine is rare, estimated to occur at a rate of 5 to 7 cases per 100,000 vaccinees [103].

In the pediatric cases reported in the literature, children had mild respiratory illness, although the severity of the disease in adolescents seemed more similar to that in adults [108], [109], [110], [111]. Infants born to mothers with confirmed SARS were born prematurely, presumably because of maternal illness. Two of the five infants described developed severe abdominal disease (coronavirus has been linked to necrotizing enterocolitis), although coronavirus was not identified in any of the infants [112]. It is appropriate to provide expressed breast milk or breastfeed when either the mother or infant has SARS.",

            "text": "WNV infection leads to approximately one case of severe neurologic disease for every 20 cases of nonspecific febrile illness and every 150 to 300 cases of asymptomatic infection (seroconversion) it causes. Although the case fatality rate is high in hospitalized patients or individuals over 70 years of age; children with clinical illness and infants with infection less than 1 year of age have been reported rarely [113]. Transmission occurs through mosquito bite, with mosquitoes of the genus Culex being the primary vectors. Transmission also has been reported during pregnancy [114], [115], through organ transplant [116], through percutaneous exposure in laboratory workers [117], and through blood and blood product transfusion [118]. One case of possible WNV transmission through breastfeeding has been reported [119]. The mother was infected by a blood transfusion after delivery, became sick 8 days later, and was being hospitalized with a meningoencephalitis-like illness. The infant was breast-fed from birth through the second day of the mother's hospitalization. Samples of the mother's cerebrospinal fluid and breast milk from days 16 and 24 after delivery tested positive for WNV-specific IgM. The breast milk from day 16 was also positive for WNV-RNA on PCR testing. Live WNV was not cultured from the breast milk. The infant remained well. Although this may constitute a case of transmission of WNV through breast milk, the absence of illness in this infant (and most infants/children), the transient nature of maternal viremia with WNV, and the rarity of such a transmission event suggest that there is no reason to avoid breastfeeding or breast milk when a mother is infected with WNV.",

In certain situations, prophylactic or empiric therapy may be advised for the infant (eg, T pallidum, M tuberculosis, H influenzae) (see Table 1).
