The DTI and RTI (Equations 4 and 5, respectively) are weighted averages of the disease specific velocities (C3, D3 and T3) and the resource specific velocities (H3, I3, V3), respectively. For the purposes of this paper, the weights for DTI and RTI were set to 1. The DTI gives users a measure of regional or statewide disease spread and severity. For example, a DTI less than 1 implies all disease specific velocities are less than 1 and thus current new cases, new deaths and percent positive tests are all lower than the previous week. A DTI less than 1 for a sustained period of time would indicate the disease is receding (decelerating); a DTI equal to 1 implies all of the disease specific velocities are holding steady (not accelerating or decelerating); and a DTI greater than 1 indicates at least one of the disease specific velocities is greater than the previous week and the disease is progressing (accelerating). RTI is interpreted in a similar fashion as DTI, but for resource specific metrics.",

Being a ratio of two severity indices, an RRI that is too small or too large is bad. For example, an RRI that is close to 0 would imply, resources may be available, but that disease spread is large. Since hospitalization tends to lag new cases, a small RRI may indicate that health care resources may soon be in demand. An RRI that is too large would imply that healthcare resources are being stretched even though the disease severity may be waning.

The daily updates provide real-time early indicators of acceleration and deceleration trends that require timely attention. The PRAM analysis tool also clearly demonstrates the importance of both a regional and statewide approach to the allocation of critically important resources and the decisions regarding the application of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs). We continue to assess the utility of the PRAM analytic tool in Nebraska and in other communities with significantly different patterns of pandemic spread and recovery. .

The relationships among this set of metrics developed, called the Pandemic Recovery Acceleration Model (PRAM), are computed on a daily basis from three disease and three resource specific values and are scalable from the level of an individual hospital up to a county, region or statewide status. The three disease specific values 4 are the daily totals of new cases, newly reported deaths and the percent of new positive tests per day.
