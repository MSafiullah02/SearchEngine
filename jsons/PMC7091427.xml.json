            "text": "Reovirus (acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus) belongs to a highly diverse group of nonenveloped and double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA) classified within the Reoviridae family. Orthoreovirus is the genus name (the true \u201creovirus\u201d) for one of the 15 genera of the Reoviridae viruses that infect mammals, birds, and reptiles. This designation distinguishes the orthoreoviruses from other members of the family that infect plants, fish, mollusks, fungi, and insects (Clarke and Tyler 2010; Day 2009; Dermody et al. 2013). The Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV, prototypical member of the Reoviridae) is the type species of the Orthoreovirus genus that was initially associated with a subgroup of respiratory and enteric viruses present in healthy humans with minimal or no symptoms of respiratory or enteric disease; therefore, the virus was considered an \u201corphan\u201d (Sabin 1959; Jackson and Muldoon 1973; Norman and Lee 2000; Day 2009; Dermody et al. 2013). Reovirus (ReoV) is a general term that refers to the MRV and is most frequently used throughout this review. Current studies indicate that ReoV may be the most common enteric virus found in raw and treated wastewater; however, the concentration efficiency of ReoV in these matrices including natural waters has not been thoroughly evaluated. This review summarizes previous and recent findings about the occurrence of ReoV in water. Recent progress in concentration and molecular-based detection methods combined with traditional cell culture techniques will undoubtedly lead to more effective approaches to uncover the significance of ReoV in water and wastewater.",

            "text": "ReoVs are ubiquitous in their geographical distribution, and virtually all mammals, including humans, serve as host for infection (Scott 1971; Mochizuki et al. 1992; Decaro et al. 2005; Dermody et al. 2013). ReoVs infect their hosts by the fecal\u2013oral and respiratory routes. Infectious virions enter the body by ingestion of contaminated food or inhalation of virus-containing aerosols. At both portals of entry, ReoVs infect epithelial cells and disseminate to peripheral sites where they cause disease (Boehme et al. 2013). Studies indicate that ReoVs are neurotropic viruses that use both bloodborne and neural pathways to spread systemically within their hosts to cause disease (Boehme et al. 2013). Most ReoV infections in humans occur in infancy or early childhood; therefore, full seroconversion against all three major serotypes is attained by late childhood, (around 5 years of age) (Norman and Lee 2000; Day 2009; Dermody et al. 2013). Human ReoVs are rarely associated with disease, except in the very young. They are known to cause either asymptomatic or mild symptoms of upper respiratory and intestinal infections, in some cases febrile exanthema with fever (Jackson and Muldoon 1973; Clarke and Tyler 2010; Dermody et al.2013). ReoVs have been occasionally found in fecal specimens associated with childhood diarrhea (Giordano et al. 2005). More recently novel ReoVs from nonhuman animals have been identified with some infecting humans and thus raising concerns about their zoonotic potential (Chua et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2011; Kohl et al. 2012; Dermody et al. 2013; Yamanaka et al. 2014; Kawagishi et al. 2016).",

            "text": "All members of the Orthoreovirus genus contain 10 linear segments of double-stranded RNA with collinear and complementary [+] and [\u2212] strands encased in a double-layered icosahedral capsid shell (Dermody et al. 2013). These features constitute major determinants of virion stability in the environment and virion resistance against physical and chemical agents (Gomatos and Tamm 1963; Harris et al. 1987; Drayna and Fields 1982a, b; Norman and Lee 2000). The inner-capsid shell or core particle has an internal diameter of approximately 50\u201360 nm and encloses the genome. In addition, the inner capsid possesses 12 prominent projections or spikes situated as though on vertices of a regular icosahedron. The outer-capsid shell is 38 nm in diameter and surrounds the core particle (Dermody et al. 2013). The 10 dsRNA genome segments are divided into three size classes based upon their migration in polyacrylamide gels: three large (L: L1, L2, L3), three medium (M: M1, M2, M3), and four small (S: S1, S2, S3, S4) segments. These segments encode mRNAs for synthesis of 12 viral proteins that execute the ReoV replication program in a variety of cell types within diverse animal hosts. Eight of these segments encode a single protein, while two encode two proteins each. Eight of the 12 proteins are structural components of virions (\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u00b51, \u00b52, \u03c31, \u03c32, and \u03c33) and four are nonstructural (\u00b5NS, \u00b5NSC, \u03c31S, and \u03c3NS). The function of these virus-encoded proteins has been described in detail elsewhere (Schiff 1998; Dermody et al. 2013). Cell attachment \u03c31 protein is the most type-specific reovirus protein. It is also the reovirus-hemagglutinin and is a major determinant of host-range/tissue specificity and of the nature of interaction of reovirus with cells of the immune system (Schiff 1998; Dermody et al. 2013). Interestingly, studies have shown that proteins \u03c33 and \u00b51 interact extensively within the outer capsid and the extensive contacts between \u03c33 and \u00b51 molecules have been suggested to stabilize outer-capsid structure and thereby facilitate survival of virions during transmission of ReoV between hosts (Nibert et al. 1995; Schiff 1998). Furthermore, outer-capsid proteins \u03c33, \u00b51, and \u03c31 have each been associated with the stability of ReoV particles against particular physicochemical agents (Drayna and Fields 1982a, b).",

            "text": "Three morphologically similar groups of ReoV have been described based on genetic divergence and antigenic properties among serotypes. These occur mainly in the gene coding for cell attachment \u03c31 protein that gives rise to antibodies with strong, completely type-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity; strong, almost completely type-specific neutralization activity; and ability to precipitate ReoV particles (Gaillard and Joklik 1982; Cashdollar et al. 1985; Douville et al. 2008; Dermody et al. 2013). The three classically recognized serotypes represent the prototype strains: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), type 3 Dearing (T3D), and type 3 Abney (T3A). A putative fourth serotype strain isolated from a mouse in the Cameroon has been identified and named Ndelle (T4N) (Clarke and Tyler 2010; Day 2009; Kohl et al. 2012; Dermody et al. 2013). These three serotypes currently circulate in humans and other mammals (Boehme et al. 2013). They are closely related in sequence and can exchange their ten genomic dsRNA segments by genetic recombination which occurs primarily through reassortment. This process generates some progeny (reassortants) that stably behaves as the wild type that can be grown under nonpermissive temperature conditions (Shiff 1998). It is known that T1L and T3D share approximately 25 % identity in their \u03c31 protein, while other outer capsid and viral core proteins are highly conserved with 90\u201398 % identity (Douville et al. 2008). Serotypes 1, 2, and 3 differ in their response to a variety of chemical and physical inactivating agents as discussed below.",

Adams et al. (1982) using antibody immunofluorescence in cell culture was able to detect up to 210,000 ReoV per liter of untreated wastewater. Overall these studies documented higher levels of ReoV than any other enteric virus co-occurring in raw sewage and treated wastewater (Table 3). Surprisingly, ReoV occurrence in wastewaters was less frequently reported in subsequent years. This may be due to the types of cell lines used and the incubation time. The most commonly used cell line for testing for viruses in water is the BGM cell line. While ReoV will grow in this cell line, it usually requires 14 days or longer incubation for the observation of cytopathogenic effects.\n",

The relative concentration to other enteric viruses is difficult to judge because of different methods for recovery from the sludge and cell lines used for assay in the different studies. Also, quantitative assessment of removal of naturally occurring ReoV is difficult because extracting data on the operation of the processes is often not provided in enough detail. Using a primary cell line from a primate Cliver (1975) isolated ReoV in anaerobically digested sludge more commonly and in greater numbers than enteroviruses. Also, using a primary cell line Subrahamanyan (1983) reported the almost exclusive isolation of ReoV. It was also the most common isolate before sludge digestion. Laboratory studies suggest that ReoV may be more resistant to thermal inactivation than poliovirus. Brewster et al. (2005) found that ReoV was more resistant than poliovirus 1 at thermophilic (50\u201355 \u00b0C) and mesophilic (30\u201335 \u00b0C) temperatures used in anaerobic sludge treatment. However, Coxsackie and polio virus were shown to have similar inactivation rates during drying of sewage sludge (Ward and Ashley 1977). The mechanisms of ReoV inactivation in sewage sludge are complex depending on temperature, pH, ammonia, and the presence of detergents. Inactivation of ReoV results from the breakdown of the viral particles (Ward 1983). ReoV appears to show similar resistance to enteroviruses and MS2 phage to lime treatment of sludges (Ward 1983; Brewster et al. 2005; Katz and Margolin 2007). In lime-treated fecal sludge, from latrines, the reduction of ReoV type 3 was found to be similar to adenovirus type 1 and related to ammonia concentrations above pH 9 (Magri et al. 2015). The existing data suggest that ReoV may be more abundant than enteroviruses in sewage sludge and may be more resistant to digestion than enteroviruses. ReoV has been suggested as a better model for sludge treatment than enteroviruses (Brewster et al. 2005).",

Early studies demonstrated that protamine sulfate treatment provided an efficient method for concentrating ReoV and adenoviruses which tended to be overgrown by more rapid replicating enteroviruses in cell culture (England 1972). The efficiency of the protamine sulfate method with some modifications for the recovery of ReoV from waste waters and sewage was later confirmed by another study in the U.S, (Adams et al. 1982). In this study, infectious ReoV and potentially infectious ReoV particles (particles with complete outer coat) were concentrated from water and sewage by protamine sulfate precipitation followed by addition of 0.25 % fetal bovine serum and 0.005 % protamine sulfate for the first precipitation of the sample plus 0.0025 % for the second. The study reported virus recoveries between 80 and 100 % with levels of infectious ReoV greater than 105 per liter of untreated sewage, which suggested that the modified protamine precipitation method when combined with fluorescent-antibody staining was useful in determining the potential roles of the infectious virus and ReoV particles in water quality testing.",

Later, a comprehensive study from the United Kingdom (Sellwood et al. 1981) conducted over a 3-year period at a local sewage works (biological oxidation beds) found that multiple cell lines were necessary for efficient evaluation of the virus content of raw sewage and treated effluent. In this study, Vero and primary monkey kidney cells yielded the most Coxsackievirus and ReoV isolates, which were frequently isolated along with echovirus from the plant inlet (raw sewage) and outlet swabs. In a similar study in the United States, the sensitivities to ReoV (serotypes 1, 2, and 3) of 12 continuous cell lines was compared with sewage isolates precipitated by protamine sulfate (Ridinger et al. 1982). Among the cell lines evaluated, Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) was the most sensitive for isolation of ReoV, and when combined with an immunofluorescent cell count assay, the detection rate gave a ReoV titer in excess of 104/liter of raw sewage.",

Following primary concentration, different secondary concentration procedures have been used to further isolate ReoV and other enteric viruses. Two-phase separation with dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG)\u2014or PEG and NaCl\u2014beef extract elution, and PEG precipitation have been most commonly used for the secondary concentration step (Wyn-Jones 2007). Very few studies have evaluated the recovery efficiency of ReoV from water. It is very important since the sorption behavior of virus particles is governed by electrostatic interactions which are given by the virus isoelectric point (IEP); this is a characteristic parameter of the virion in equilibrium with its environmental water chemistry (Michen and Graule 2010). In this situation, the sorption behavior of a particular virus may substantially differ from the most common human viruses (i.e., poliovirus) or viral surrogates (i.e., bacteriophages) used in recovery efficiency experiments. For instance, reported isoelectric points for poliovirus strains range from 4.0 to 7.4, MS2 coliphage 2.2\u20134.0, and ReoV type 3 from 3.8 to 3.9 (Michen and Graule 2010).",

As previously mentioned, virus replication in continuous cell lines of monkey kidneys was initially applied for isolating ReoV from water; however, they have the ability to infect many continuous mammalian cell lines maintained in clinical laboratories (Dermody et al. 2013). The identification of ReoV in water based on observation of typical cythopathic effect (CPE) has been applied simultaneously with quantitative assays such as hemagglutination or immunological methods which quantify the presence of infectious and noninfectious virus particles (Condit 2013). ReoV produces a very characteristic cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in monkey kidney cell lines. The cells become granular and do not slough off as readily as with enteroviruses. Often they remain fasten to the glass by a single process and flutter in the medium as the flask/tube is agitated during microscopic examination. The addition of the proteolytic enzyme can be used to enhance infectivity in cell culture (Spendlove and Schaffer 1965). Cell culture assay methods have been concomitantly applied for quantification of ReoV infectivity such as most probable number assays (MPN) which derive MPN titers (i.e., virus titer) in replicates of cell monolayers inoculated with different equivalent volumes of a water concentrate (Lee and Jeong 2004; Sedmak et al. 2005). Studies have also shown that multiple blind passages on BGM cells may increase the presence of virus particles for subsequent detection of ReoV RNA by RT-PCR or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Muscillo et al. 2001). Interestingly, these studies have also demonstrated that the simultaneous presence of ReoV and enteroviruses can have a masking effect by hindering enterovirus amplification and detection in environmental samples highly contaminated with ReoV (Carducci et al. 2002).",

The sensitivity of amplification of ReoV RNA with these primers was evaluated differently. The detection sensitivity with primers against the L1 gene was evaluated with serial dilutions of the purified PCR-positive control. The lowest concentration in which a band could be visualized defined the sensitivity of the assay which corresponded to 100 targets per reaction (Symonds et al. 2009). Spinner and DiGiovanni (2001) used serially diluted purified nucleic acids from ReoV types 1, 2, and 3 to determine the sensitivity of the ReoV primers against the L3 gene. The detection sensitivities corresponded to approximately 3, 30, and 0.3 PFU per reaction mixture, respectively. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR reactions with primers against the S2 region was tested on the RNA extracted from serial dilutions of virus stock ranging from 105 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) to 0.1-fold. In this case, the S2 reactions were positive on the reference strains with a sensitivity of less than 102\u201310 TCID50 viral particles (Muscillo et al. 2001).",

Additional studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions using distilled water and wastewater demonstrated that among different enteric viruses evaluated ReoV and rotavirus survived more than 30 days at 26 \u00b0C and longer than 1 year at 8 \u00b0C (McDaniels et al. 1983).

Doses of UV light for ReoV type 1 (Lang) have been observed to be almost double of poliovirus type 1 for a 99.9 % reduction in titer (24 vs. 46 mW/sec/cm2) (Harris et al. 1987). McClain and Spendlove (1966) observed differences in UV light sensitivity of ReoV 1\u20133 at higher doses of UV, with ReoV type 3 being the most resistant. They also observed a nonlinear rate of inactivation and attributed to it experimentally to multiplicity of reactivation, i.e., two or more viruses infecting the same cell with different regions of damaged genome. They also observed that multiplicity of reactivation occurred between the different ReoV types, i.e., ReoV 1 could serve to compliment ReoV 2 infecting the same cell. It has also been suggested that the greater resistance of ReoV to UV light is due to its double-stranded segmented genome, a thicker protein coat than the single-stranded enteroviruses, and greater ability to aggregate (Harris et al. 1987). In a study of resistance of naturally occurring coliphages and ReoV to UV light in secondary effluent, the rate of ReoV inactivation was found to be almost identical to F-specific coliphages (Nieuwstand et al. 1991).",

(1971) reported that highly purified ReoV types 1\u20133 were more sensitive to chlorine in buffered water and Potomac River water than various types of adenovirus, poliovirus, echovirus, and Coxsackievirus. The most detailed studies on ReoV inactivation by disinfectants was conducted by Sharp et al. (1975). They found that inactivation of ReoV and enteroviruses was highly dependent on the size and number of viral aggregates. The viruses could be made to aggregate and deaggregate by changing the pH, salt concentration, and the types of salts in solution (Floyd and Sharp 1977; 1978a;1978b). Their studies also suggested that the observed tailing effect during bromine disinfection was due to aggregates larger than 1,000 virions. These \u201csuper sized\u201d aggregates were too rare to be seen under the electron microscope, but by sonication they could break some of these resulting in an increase in titer. They suggested that these \u201csuper\u201d aggregates were formed in cell culture and in addition to aggregated virus might also contain cell debris. Another phenomenon observed was the ability of ReoV and poliovirus type 1 to form aggregates together (Floyd 1979). Thus, dissimilar viruses could form aggregates. Since they found that 105\u2013106 virions were needed to form aggregates, they concluded this was not a significant factor in viral resistant in wastewater. However, with modern molecular methods such as qPCR for quantifying genome copies of viruses, concentrations of 105\u2013106 per mL of adenoviruses, Aichi viruses, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) are known to occur in wastewater (Kitajima et al. 2014). In addition, the formation of disinfectant-resistant virial aggregates may be possible, especially considering that the total concentration of all human, plant, and bacterial viruses likely exceeds 107 per mL in domestic wastewater (Kitajima et al. 2014).",

Existing data suggest that they may be among the most common enteric viruses in wastewater, if not the most common. Studies on disinfected wastewater suggest that they may be more sensitive to chlorine than enteroviruses. However, they are more resistant to ultraviolet light disinfection than enteroviruses because of their dsRNA genome. ReoV also appears to be more environmentally stable than enteroviruses. Fout et al. (1996) found ReoV to be the most common viruses in groundwater in the United States. Studies at managed aquifer sites also suggest that they may travel further than other enteric viruses in the subsurface (Betancourt et al. 2014). However, their role in human disease is unclear, but given the role of bats in emerging zoonotic diseases such as SARS, Ebola, and MERS and zoonotic potential (including bats) of ReoV, additional studies on routes of human exposure are needed.",
