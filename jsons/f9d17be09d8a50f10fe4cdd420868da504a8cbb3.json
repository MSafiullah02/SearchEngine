This point is clearly exemplified by the current CoVID-19 pandemic, but also by past experiences such as SARS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and resurgent measles outbreaks, all of which have drastically disrupted everyday life, diminished public health resources and dominated media headlines. Vaccines, when available, represent one of the most significant, cost-effective and safe public health interventions capable of mitigating such outbreaks. However, vaccine refusal has steadily increased and routine immunisation coverage for infectious diseases, such as measles, has decreased over time (WHO-UNICEF coverage estimates, 2018) . New estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) imply that as a result of vaccine refusal more than 140,000 people died from measles in 2018 worldwide. While the greatest impacts have been in the poorest countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, wealthier countries have also struggled to contain measles outbreaks, with significant ramifications for public health. In 2019, the United States reported its highest number of cases in 25 years, while four countries in Europe -Albania, the Czech Republic, Greece, and the United Kingdom -lost their measles elimination status in 2018 following protracted outbreaks.",

According to the WHO Strategic Group of Experts (WHO SAGE), vaccine hesitancy is a complex behavioural concept, which is context-specific, and varies across time, place and vaccine type. More formally, it is defined as \"a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services\" (Bedford et al. 2018) , fueled by the widespread misperception that many serious infections no longer circulate or that vaccines themselves are dangerous. Indeed, after decades of successful immunisation activities, low incidence rates associated with VPD have decreased public concerns with respect to infectious diseases.

Reports indicate the leading causes of vaccine hesitancy are: i) fear of vaccine side effects, ii) perceived low risk of VPD, and iii) mistrust in health care providers. Unfortunately, providing corrective information on vaccine safety, refuting vaccine myths (such as the link between the MMR vaccine and autism) and providing information on the dangers of contracting infectious diseases has been shown to be ineffective and, might even reduce vaccination intentions (Nyhan et al. 2013 , Nyhan and Reifler 2015 . Compulsory childhood vaccination is yet another tool that governments have to increase coverage levels and a few countries (ie., Italy, France, Germany, Australia) have introduced it in their national programs or are currently debating its appropriateness (MacDonald et al. 2018) . Studies show that requiring vaccination can improve rates in high-income countries, although there is limited evidence in low-or middle-income settings (Omer et al. 2019) . A challenge with compulsory vaccination is that it can increase inequities in access to resources, because penalties for noncompliance can disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups. Another approach to convincing people to vaccinate, that has received less attention, is to trigger altruistic behaviour, as prompting greater concern for others' welfare may lead individuals to vaccinate even .

In a vaccination context, altruistic behavior might be evoked by drawing people's attention to individuals who cannot vaccinate due to personal medical conditions, and therefore are critically dependent on herd immunity, to be protected from the disease. This paper explores the relationship between altruistic behavior and vaccination intentions. Our expectation is that people are driven by a desire to care for those vulnerable individuals who are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons, such as the immunocompromised, or for safety concerns as is the case of newborns and pregnant women. We expect this sense of altruism to be even stronger among those who experienced this status at some point in their own life, either because they personally suffered from a health-related condition or because they cared for someone who was immunocompromised and not eligible for vaccination. We are also interested in the relative importance of public health concerns as they relate to cooperation. If people care about public health outcomes, we expect to see greater cooperation using a more explicit (i.e., vaccinerelated) communication strategy rather than a neutral one. To empirically assess these mechanisms, we conducted a survey experiment on a sample of Italian parents and a lab experiment with graduate students in an Italian University. In the former, we asked parents to play a standard one-shot game with two players and payoffs mimicking the tradeoff between vaccinating or not. A three-player game was included in the survey to assess the impact of a passive player on individual cooperative behaviour. Building upon this baseline, we used lab experiment to test the effect of framing (vaccination vs. neutral) and the level of detail of the narratives (high detail and numerical vs. low detail and narrative). To thoroughly explore the determinants of the decisionmaking process we asked participants in the lab experiment to play thirty rounds of the game, either as active or passive players. Results from both studies highlight the importance of altruistic behavior in vaccination decisions and allowed us to better disentangle the mechanisms in place.",

The framing was later expanded for the laboratory experiment. In the first variant, two active players had to make a choice between two actions, a cooperative and a noncooperative one. In the second variant, a third player was introduced, who had no action in the game and whose payoff depended on the actions of the active players, with the payoff being highest when both active players cooperated, second-highest when at least one cooperated, and lowest when no one cooperated. Note that there is trade-off between what is best for the passive player and for society: total surplus is higher (17 versus 15) if only one active player chooses the cooperative action but the passive player is much better off if both cooperate. In addition, the game was designed to make the payoff difference between the uncooperative and the cooperative action .

In each session, either the number of players varied and the wording was kept unchanged, or the wording varied and the number of players was kept unchanged throughout the 30 rounds. For the two-to-three player games, the wording of the game was the same throughout the entire experimental session, but until round 10 participants played in pairs and then switched to playing in groups of three. In some of the sessions where wording was not always neutral, subjects were also shown a (high or low detail) prompt at the beginning of the first block of the vaccination game. Since allocation to different designs of the game was random, we can consider them as if they were treatments in a randomized experiment and treat the estimates as causal effects.

Participants were assigned a number taking a value from 1-3 for each treatment, which remained the same for the entire session for three player games and for round 10-30 for two-to-three player games. Then, subjects were rotated to play the passive player, being passive for one third of the rounds played per game versions, as shown in Table 2 . Groups were reshuffled at every round, which participants were aware of. We chose to change group composition in every round so as not to leave room for retaliation against opponents in the previous round. More than one week before the experiment, we asked participants to fill in an online questionnaire aimed at measuring their level of risk aversion, altruism, and positive reciprocity (ref: Preference Module -Laboratory Version by Falk et al. (2016) ). .This allowed us to control in the statistical analysis for individual characteristics that could affect subject behavior in the game (see the Appendix for more details).

This result, in line with previous work (Smith, Chu, Barker 2004; Yang et al. 2016 ) may be a consequence of heterogeneous risk attitudes, with lower income people being more risk averse and interested in a sure payoff (i.e. how much they earn) 1 . However, we found that the inclusion of a third passive player in the game increased cooperation of parents across all income brackets (the remaining 71% of our sample) but the lowest. In particular, for parents in the lowest income bracket the proportion of those deciding to cooperate significantly dropped from 79% to 61%, whereas, for parents in the highest income bracket, the overall proportion increased from 67% to 80%, suggesting that altruistic behavior may drive cooperation.",

To this end, messaging strategies invoking altruistic behaviour by, for example, Another pattern that we find is conditional cooperation in a social dilemma situation (see the seminal paper of Fehr et al.

The positive effect of perceived cooperation suggests that national health authorities might find it beneficial to use messages that emphasize how many have already vaccinated, as opposed to, for example, by how much uptake was below the target.

In relation to CoVID-19, it is also important to stress that, once a vaccine will be available, policies will need to incentivize vaccination for many people for which the perception of risk from the disease is low, such as the youngest.

You will be allocated the role of one of the three players, A, B, or C. Then Players A and B will select Vaccinate or Don't. The choices will be made independently and at the same time. Your payoff will depend on both your and your opponent's choice. Player C has no action in this game, but note that his/her payoff depends on your actions. Before making your choice in the game, you will also read a short scenario about a disease outbreak. These payoffs are displayed in the table below, in which the amount to the left in each cell is the payoff of Player A and the payoff to the right is that of Player B.",

The treatment variables are indicators of the presence of a third player (0 if two player game is played, 1 if three player game is played), framing (0 if neutral, 1 if vaccination), low detail (1 if low detail prompt is provided, 0 otherwise) and high detail (1 if high detail prompt is provided, 0 otherwise). The reference condition is two-player, neutral wording, no detail.
