Moreover, Ferreira AC, et al. (9) observed that, beyond members of the Flaviviridae family, sofosbuvir also inhibits chikungunya virus replication. They found that sofosbuvir was three times more selective in inhibiting Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) production and also was 25% less cytotoxic, in human hepatoma cells, than ribavirin. CHIKV is a member of the Togaviridae family has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and its RdRp enzyme (is coded by NsP4 gene), as with other RNA polymerases from positive-sense RNA viruses (29) , has well-conserved motifs. In this regard, since coronaviruses are a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses with conserved polymerase, SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir.",

Which feature of sofosbuvir may give hope? That may be intracellular stability of the triphosphate metabolite. The surprising differences in stability of nucleoside analogue triphosphates of nucleotide analogues have been reported. It has been shown that the triphosphate of the Sofosbuvir showed an extremely high intracellular stability (~35 h), which was also made responsible for the significant and persistent anti-HCV effect of active drug to inhibit NS5B-polymerase (37) . Babusis D, et al. also confirmed this observation and evaluated In vitro metabolism of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in primary human hepatocytes (38) . They showed that activation was efficient for two investigated drugs, but the triphosphate metabolite of sofosbuvir Overall, although sofosbuvir is not currently listed as potential option of COVID-19 drug therapy, till now (https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/988648/COVID-19-Drug-Therapy_Mar-2020.pdf), the evidence on the advantageous action of this drug on viral RdRp in vitro, stability of triphosphate drug metabolite and \"the least interaction with standard of care\" constituted the rationale to perform a trial on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, sofosbuvir is safe and well tolerated at 400 mg daily in a 24 week therapeutic regimen (9), clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are rare and its important drug interaction is with amiodarone, which causes bradycardia (Sovaldi [Sofosbuvir]: Prescribing information. Foster City, CA: Gilead Sciences; 2013). Sofosbuvir presents an unusually clean safety profile for a nucleotide therapeutic. The safety profile of sofosbuvir, either in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV or in combination with ribavirin alone in all-oral regimen, was excellent, even in cirrhotic patients. Also, In vitro, sofosbuvir exhibits no cytotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, or bone marrow toxicity when dosed at multiples above the effective dose (40, 41) .",

The written research proposal was submitted to the University research council/Ethics Committee, then the approved proposal registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical trials (code: https://www.irct.ir/trial/46790). The clinical trial is currently in process. In agreement with (9), we advocate generic sofosbuvir beyond treatment of HCV-infected patients. As it represents a safe and Arch Med Res E20_488 9 effective antiviral option, compared to similar anti-viral agents, we encourage clinical investigators to consider these dual-component HCV drugs, (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir), as re-purposed treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

            "text": ", SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, like HCV and the flaviviridae (9), are positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses and these viruses share a similar replication mechanism requiring a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). So, there is a strong possibility that Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, AZT (and other HCV/HIV nucleoside/nucleotide analogues such as Remdesivir) can tightly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In a recent in silico (preliminary) study, sequence analyses as well as homology modeling were used to build a new SARS-nCoV RdRp model which then targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin (10). The docking scores suggested possible eligibilities of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, (and Remdesivir) as potent drugs against the new coronavirus. These theoretical data needed to be confirmed by the experimental observations. Using polymerase extension experiments, in vitro, Chien M, et al. also demonstrated that the biologically activate triphosphate forms of four wellknown nucleotide/nucleoside analogue anti-viral (anti-HCV/HBV, anti-HIV/AIDS) drugs; Sofosbuvir",

As indicated in Figure 1, active triphosphate metabolite is produced by intracellular nucleoside-diphosphate-kinases (NDKs). The question may be raised: is NDK enzyme present in alveolar epithelial type II cells and the other cells, infected by SARS-CoV-2? NDKs, encoded by NME (also named NM23) genes, are a family of multifunctional enzymes that are evolutionarily highly conserved among different species (from bacteria to humans), are found in all cells, and their activities maintain an equilibrium between the concentrations of different nucleoside triphosphates, so are the source of RNA and DNA precursors (except ATP), CTP for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis and GTP for protein elongation, signal transduction and microtubule polymerization (34). Using isoform-specific antibodies, Muimo R, et al. suggested that NDK-A and NDK-B are present bound to the airway epithelial membranes (31). In an interesting study on pneumocyte and hepatic cell lines, Mumtaz R, et al. hypothesized that the conflicting results of sofosbuvir-mediated virus",
