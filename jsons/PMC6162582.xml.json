            "text": "Feed manufacturing equipment has been shown to be a potential source of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cross-contamination (Schumacher et al., 2017). Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective feed mill equipment surface decontamination method (Muckey, 2016). However, this is not practical in most current commercial feed production settings. Methods to chemically or thermally mitigate the risk of PEDV transmission in feed and feed ingredients have been investigated (Cochrane et al., 2015; 2016; 2017). These methods are not universally applicable to all feed manufacturing facilities due to equipment cost or safety concerns. Other research has assessed sequencing batches of PEDV-negative feed following an inoculated batch of feed to assess the effectiveness of reducing the risk of viral transmission (Schumacher et al., 2016a). Although this may be a practical mitigation technique for feed mills to implement, there remains a significant quantity of viral particles on feed-contact surfaces including dust production and distribution throughout the facility (Schumacher et al., 2017). This dust may pose a risk for contamination of subsequent diets. One potential solution is to use chemical mitigants such as formaldehyde or medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) as a periodic flush step within the feed manufacturing process. Rice hulls were selected as the carrier for this chemical flush because of the relatively low cost and high degree of abrasiveness, which may help facilitate the removal of viral contamination on equipment surfaces. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine effects of MCFA- or formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches as potential PEDV chemical mitigation strategies during feed manufacturing.",

Prior to the experiment, the FSRC was decontaminated following a standard protocol approved by the Kansas State University Institutional Biosafety Committee. Prior to initiation of the experiment, the FSRC was physically cleaned using sweeping and compressed air, and then chemically cleaned using a 2-step process of a 1:256 dilution of ammonium glutaraldehyde blend (Synergize; Preserve International, Reno, NV) and a 1:32 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution using procedures outlined by Huss et al. (2017). The facility was then heated to 60 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h and cooled to room temperature at which point the environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs (World Bioproducts, Mundelein, IL) moistened with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4 1X, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and verified devoid of PEDV viral RNA to ensure efficacy of the disinfection procedures prior to initiation of the experiment. After chemical disinfection, the facility was held in containment mode with negative air pressure and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters preventing contaminated air from leaving the facility. Containment was maintained throughout the experiment and through the post-decontamination procedures.",

Kruse Feedmill located at Kansas State University and was verified to be devoid of PEDV and porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV) genetic material as determined via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) prior to initiation of the experiment (Table 1). Rice hulls were also verified to be devoid of detectable PEDV and PDCoV genetic material. The production scale mixer used was a 0.113-m3 electric paddle mixer (H.C. Davis Sons Manufacturing, model # SS-L1; Bonner Springs, KS) with a mix time of 5 min as described previously (Schumacher et al., 2017). Feed was discharged at a rate of approximately 4.5 kg/min into a bucket elevator (Universal Industries, Cedar Falls, IA) fitted with 74 buckets (114 cm3 each), and then discharged through a 25.4-cm diameter discharge spout and collected in plastic biohazard bags. Laboratory scale stainless steel paddle mixers (n = 13; Cabela\u2019s Inc., Sidney, NE) were validated for mixer efficiency for 2.5- and 5.0-kg batches using a mix time of 5.0 min. Validation of mixers prior to the experiment to achieve a coefficient of variation of less than 10% was done following previously described procedures (McCoy, 2005). The volume of rice hulls and feed added to the mixing systems was designed to reflect the fill volume relative to mixer capacity of paddle mixers in a commercial setting.",

Inoculation of the feed used similar procedures as those described by Schumacher et al. (2016b) and Cochrane et al. (2017). Briefly in this experiment, inoculation of feed to be used in each of the laboratory scale mixers was performed in 5-kg batches using an additional laboratory scale mixer in which 4.5 kg of PEDV-negative feed was added to the mixer and 500 mL of 105 TCID50/mL\u2013diluted viral inoculum was added to create 5 kg of 104 TCID50/g\u2013inoculated feed. This batch was mixed for 5 min, at which point it was split into 2 samples using a riffle splitter and weighed into 2.5-kg batches, bagged, and stored in a freezer (\u221212 \u00b0C) until inoculated into an appropriate laboratory scale mixer.

Upon conclusion of the addition of the virus, the batch was mixed for 5.0 min to ensure an even mix of virus into the feed inoculum. The PEDV feed inoculum was then added to 45 kg of PEDV-free swine diet in the production scale mixer to create the 50-kg batch of PEDV-positive feed (104 TCID50/g). The entire batch of PEDV-positive feed was then mixed for 5 min, discharged into the bucket elevator, and collected at the bucket elevator discharge spout in biohazard waste bags. A sample of PEDV-positive feed was collected from multiple locations within the discharged batch of PEDV-positive feed. This sample of PEDV inoculated feed was combined at a 1:1 ratio with PEDV-inoculated feed (also 104 TCID50/g) from laboratory scale mixer to create a single PEDV-positive sample. After inoculation of the production scale mixer, 36 kg of ground rice hulls was added directly to the mixer, along with 4 kg of MCFA (1:1:1 ratio of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) to create a 10% MCFA rice hull flush with a similar mixer fill volume as a 50-kg batch of feed. After a 5.0-min mix time, 6 samples were collected from various locations within the mixer. The rice hull flush batch was then discharged into the bucket elevator and collected at the bucket elevator discharge spout. Samples of discharged flush material were collected at multiple times during discharge to create a single composite sample. A 50-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was then added to the production-scale mixer and allowed to mix for 5.0 min. A 225-g sample was collected from the mixer and remaining feed was discharged into the bucket elevator and collected at the bucket elevator discharge spout. Again, a 225-g sample was collected from 6 locations of the bucket elevator to create a single composite sample. Samples were placed on ice and transported to the laboratory for qRT-PCR analysis preparation. Dust samples were also collected throughout the experiment, including dust collected after mixing of 104 TCID50/g\u2013inoculated feed in both the laboratory and production scale systems, after mixing of 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls in the production-scale mixer, and collected from mixing of the subsequent feed following the 10% MCFA rice hull flush. All dust collection surfaces were above the fill level of the mixer; therefore, all collected dust had become airborne before depositing on the collection surfaces. Dust was collected from the same surface after each batch of feed (positive-inoculated feed, 10% MCFA rice hull flush, and subsequent PEDV-free feed); therefore, dust collected was produced during the associated mixing process and not from previous manufacturing processes.",

A total of 4 aliquots from each sample bottle were collected and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until qRT-PCR analysis was performed within 7 d of inoculation on 1 aliquot per sample bottle. The remaining 3 samples per bottle were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use.

Upon arrival, piglets were ear tagged, weighed, and randomly assigned to bioassay treatment rooms. Fecal swabs were negative for PEDV, PDCoV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) using qRT-PCR analysis. Serum was negative for PEDV antibody by an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay and negative for TGEV antibody by ELISA conducted at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL). Pigs were allowed 2 d of adjustment to the new pens before inoculation. Three pigs were housed per room with all pigs challenged with a single treatment. Each room had an independent ventilation system. Biosecurity protocols were in place to prevent viral spread between rooms. Pigs were fed liquid milk replacer once daily and offered a commercial-pelleted swine diet ad libitum with free access to water. Each of 33 pigs (11 rooms) receiving supernatant samples were inoculated on day 0 with 20 mL of the PBS supernatant by orogastric gavage. Each of 9 pigs (3 rooms) which were inoculated with dust samples followed similar procedures; however, the remaining solid fraction of the inoculum was placed in the mouth of each pig and were stimulated to swallow. Rectal swabs were collected daily from all piglets and tested for PEDV RNA via qRT-PCR on 2-, 0-, 2-, 4-, 6-, and 7-day postinoculation (dpi).

Previous work from our group has also shown that PEDV genetic material is widely dispersed within a feed manufacturing facility (Schumacher et al., 2017). When batches of feed are inoculated with biological agents, specifically PEDV, a large amount of dust is generated and rapidly fills the manufacturing area depositing on virtually every surface. We have presumed that this material is widely dispersed through viral particles carried on dust. In support of this presumption, the results in this study indicate that the presence of PEDV genetic material in dust can be infectious. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data reported that has indicated dust within a feed mill can contain an infectious viral pathogen.

Also, these surfaces have been shown to be difficult to decontaminate (Huss et al., 2017). In such event that biosecurity measures fail and pathogens such as PEDV enter a feed manufacturing facility, methods to reduce risk of PEDV transmission by feed or ingredients shift to mitigation strategies. Multiple strategies have been proposed to reduce transmission, typically falling into point-in-time or residual duration of activity strategies. Point-in-time strategies include the use of irradiation and thermal processing, whereas residual duration of activity strategies is commonly thought of as chemical mitigation in which feed additives such as MCFA, formaldehyde, essential oils, and dietary acidifiers are included to reduce risk of disease transmission. Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages, and incorporation into feed safety plans should be specific to a given set of circumstances.",

In a similar manner by which pharmaceutical compounds are flushed through feed manufacturing equipment (FDA, 1976), sequencing of feed has been proposed to potentially reduce subsequent cross-contamination of PEDV (Schumacher et al., 2016b). The quantity of detectible genetic material was reduced as subsequent batches of feed were manufactured. Also, genetic material was detectible for a longer duration in samples collected from the discharge spout of the experimental bucket elevator compared with samples collected from the mixer. Samples collected from the mixer caused infection for 2 subsequent batches of feed, whereas no samples collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout for batches of feed following the inoculated batch caused infection. Thus, it has been shown that contamination within feed manufacturing equipment can be reduced using protocols to minimize contamination in later batches of feed. In relation to the current study, a similar reduction in the amount of quantifiable genetic material was observed with increasing number of batches through the mixing and handling equipment. Increasing the number of batches through a system reduces the level of contamination within the feed and on feed contact surfaces. However, environmental contamination is still a significant concern. In the current study, the presence of detectible viral RNA in the 10% MCFA-treated rice hull flush sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout, whereas no genetic material was found when collected from the mixer suggests that bucket elevators can be a significant cross-contamination source within feed manufacturing systems. The inability of feed manufacturing equipment to be completely cleaned between batches of feed, specifically the boot of bucket elevators is a likely cross-contamination source.",

The use of chemical treatments to reduce PEDV quantity and infectivity characteristics within feed and feed ingredients has been extensive, including commercial feed additives (Trudeau et al., 2016) as well as MCFA\u2019s (Cochrane et al., 2015; 2017; Dee et al., 2016) and formaldehyde (Dee et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2017). The use of MCFA\u2019s has shown significant potential to provide substantial efficacy in reduction of PEDV transmission and could potentially be implemented in the future. Inclusion rates of MCFA\u2019s used in previous PEDV mitigation studies have used a 2% maximum inclusion on a wt:wt basis. In the current study, the 2% inclusion rate reduced the number of samples with detectible RNA compared with rice hulls alone, whereas no PEDV RNA was detected in the 10% MCFA inclusion. Thus, a gradient in efficacy was observed with greater efficacy as PEDV mitigation flushes with 10% inclusion of MCFA.",

Limitations exist such that use of commercial formaldehyde products is not practical in all feed manufacturing facilities due to the lack of application equipment or low usage in swine or poultry feed making justification of such a system impractical. In the current study, the inclusion rate was based on manufacturer recommendation for complete feed and was found to be more efficacious at reducing the amount in quantifiable genetic material in the flush samples than untreated rice hulls and rice hulls treated with 2% MCFA. This efficacy is consistent with previous literature demonstrating formaldehyde products are efficacious at reducing quantities of detectible genetic material as well as infectivity (Dee et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2017). Although no differences were observed in bioassay among treated and untreated rice hulls, chemical treatment of rice hull flushes including the use of formaldehyde and MCFA\u2019s reduced the quantity of detectible genetic material.",

Additionally, chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde and 10% MCFA provided additional reduction in detectible RNA and yielded no infectivity in na\u00efve pigs.
