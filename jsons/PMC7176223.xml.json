Many sets containing molecules active at a given target mixed in with known or presumed inactives (better referenced as decoys) have been created and have been used to demonstrate the performance of individual methods, or compare the performance of multiple methods. Table 1 provides a summary of many of these data sets, most of which are publicly available. A key consideration is the choice of inactives/decoys present in these datasets. Ideally, the physicochemical profile of the inactives/decoys should be matched to those of the actives, thereby preventing the observed enrichment from being a surrogate for property differences between active and inactive members. This is a consideration because many scoring functions are somewhat correlated with the molecular weight and lipophilicity of the ligands docked and scored.\n",

The first is the enrichment factor, enrichment for short, which is the ratio of the cumulative number of actives in the top N% of the total number in the dataset to random retrieval rate. Many early studies focused on the enrichment obtained when the top 10% of the dataset was screened. However, this is operationally unrealistic if compound collections exceed 100,000 compounds, which is common in mid- to large-sized companies. A more realistic test is the enrichment obtained in the top 0.1\u20131% of the compounds ranked. Many papers now include 10%, 5%, and 1%. This method unfortunately depends on the ratio of actives to decoys present in the dataset and makes comparisons across datasets difficult.",

This also graphically demonstrates the enrichment as a continuum, plotting the fraction of the actives retrieved (true positive retrieval) against the fraction of the inactives retrieved (false positive retrieval) [15]. The first ratio is the sensitivity of the method (fraction of compounds that are predicted to be active out of the total true actives present in the sample) and the second is the specificity of the method (the fraction obtained by subtracting from 1 the ratio of the true negatives to total negatives which would be the ratio of compounds falsely predicted to be positive out of all the inactives). The area under the curve, AUROC, is a measure of the efficiency of the method. As the VS method gets better the area under the ROC curve will approach 1. The method is better than random if the area is >0.5 and this method allows comparison across datasets since the curve shape and area are independent of the size of the dataset. Figure 2 shows a ROC curve reproduced from a PubMedCentral Article, which also has a lucid account of this widely used statistical method [16, 17].\n",

Notably, the enrichment in structure-based methods that utilize docking and scoring can be highly dependent on the quality of the scoring function employed and how sensitive it is to small errors which creep in at the docking step [18, 19]. Therefore, by testing performance against a variety of targets, a more realistic assessment of a given technique can be produced. This information allows the experienced drug hunter to better tailor their VS experiment to the protein class. In recent years, there has been a significant advance in the ease of availability of curated datasets publicly available ZINC and DUD being notable examples [19, 20] that allow comparison of the performance of different methods using active/decoy combinations available to all practitioners of the art.",

Generally, any protocol leading to a small number of compounds tested is biased toward enrichment. In this case, the strategy can often involve multiple serial VS methods with aggressive property filtering. With fewer experimental constraints, the computational chemist is afforded the luxury of fewer assumptions. For example, by performing a pharmacophore-based VS, but not refining the data set by docking into a known protein complex, compounds that might otherwise be excluded due to a change in the active site might be found. Furthermore, the practice of inspection generally aids in eliminating unrealistic binding modes or undesirable chemical functionality [21]. This is done with the risk that the unexpected turns out to be true.",

An exception to this rule is the practice of computationally screening a large combinatorial virtual library, identifying potential actives and following up with combinatorial synthesis of a smaller subset of the library [22\u201324].

            "text": "For many practical reasons, some element of filtering is often applied either at the point of creating a subset of \u201cchosen\u201d compounds for VS, or to a VS hit list before ordering compounds for testing. A number of property-based filtering criteria are available. By far the most famous are the Lipinski rule of five criteria [29\u201331]. By reviewing the computed properties of known oral drugs, a pattern emerged that suggested that an orally absorbed drug had a molecular weight less than 500, fewer than five hydrogen bond donating groups, fewer than 10 hydrogen bond accepting groups, and a clogP less than five. Veber et al. [32] further proposed that intestinal permeability decreased as the polar surface area (PSA) exceeded 140 \u00c52. Inspired by these studies, a number of researchers demonstrated that the impetus of most lead optimization efforts tended to add size and lipophilicity to the molecule, and that the desired lead should be smaller and less hydrophobic than the eventual drug [33, 34]. This work has caused a number of researchers to limit the size of the ligands that are introduced into the \u201ccollections\u201d of potential leads. From a practical perspective, these rules have considerable operational benefit, because they limit the size and conformational complexity of the molecules assessed. This leads to smaller databases, and less search time per molecule. Another filter which addresses size complexity from an operational perspective is the number of rotational bonds present in the molecule [35]. Prefiltering the collection to remove molecules with more than 10 rotatable bonds is a common practice except in specialized situations where there is prior knowledge that a long linear chain is a necessity for biological activity.",

While effective at further reducing the numbers of compounds in a database or list of virtual hits, the applicability of a general model on a compound from a series on which the model was not trained is suspect, at best.

It has also been proposed as a contributor to atherosclerosis, cancer and osteoporosis. To seed their study, 43 known 5-lipoxygenase pathway inhibitors were used. The investigators chose the AnalytiCon Megx library of purified natural products as their database, which contained 1,298 compounds at the time of testing and the Nat-X library containing 7,839 compounds [74]. The CATS-2D topological pharmacophore-pair descriptors [75, 76] were used, and 430 hits (10/query) were assessed visually for the novelty of their scaffolds. Just 18 were tested, of which two showed activity in a cell-based assay. Both hits were from a library of natural products derived from \u03b1-santonin. For each hit, several close neighbors were selected for screening from the NAT-5 library. Additional hits were obtained for both series. Since cell-based screening was performed first, followed by receptor-based screens, some ambiguity remains as to whether the hits \u2013 especially related to series 2, are genuine 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors or act elsewhere in the pathway probed by the cellular assay.",

A set of known actives consisting of 472 dopamine D2 and D3 ligands was assembled from the literature. The SPECS database of 230,000 compounds was chosen from which to identify compounds. Two descriptor sets were calculated: MOE2D [51] and CATS3D [77] for both query and database molecules. Neighbors of the known actives were then identified using NIPALSTREE hierarchical clustering, hierarchical k-Nearest Neighbor analysis, and a self-organizing map analysis. These analyses yielded 37, 144, and 52 neighbors respectively. These hitlists were culled by considering druglike properties, the presence of an ionizable nitrogen (a key pharmacophoric element) and novelty. Of 17 compounds eventually purchased and tested, nine had potent (K\ni <1\u03bcM) D2 binding and six had potent D2 binding. The most interesting had dopamine D3 binding of 65 nM and was 13-fold selective over D2. As a follow-on study, a pharmacophore model was built using the MOE [51] software and the dataset of literature and recently identified molecules. This was applied to the SPECS database, and four additional compounds were ordered. The best had dopamine D3 binding of 65 nM and was mildly selective over D2. All four had binding of <10 \u03bcM at either the D2 or D3 receptors.",

The ZINC database [16, 19] of 65,208 compounds (in 2005) was reduced to 1,913 compounds by applying pharmacokinetic filters. Molecular weight was restricted to between 200 and 600 amu, and clogP to between 1 and 5. In addition, three Volsurf [78] ligand-based models were applied to select compounds predicted to have good absorption, limited blood-brain barrier penetration, and adequate cell permeation. From this smaller pool of compounds, molecules were chosen that were similar to six known potassium channel openers. This was accomplished by principal components analysis of the GRIND [79] (grid-independent pharmacophore descriptors), multivariate similarity of TOPP [80] (three-point pharmacophore-based fingerprints) and pairwise superposition and scoring of FLAP [80] (four point pharmacophore-based descriptors) were calculated for query and target molecules and similar compounds identified. After inspection and selection, 3 compounds of 32 eventually purchased demonstrated E\nmax >100% when tested in channel preparations. The paper highlights that each different type of descriptor used identified different compounds, which were combined into the final set that was ordered.",

Yamazaki and coworkers undertook this analysis to identify new classes of PDE1 and PDE5 inhibitors for development as potential cardiovascular therapeutics. Existing SAR for 130 compounds was initially used to train a CART recursive partitioning model, with 10,000 diverse compounds selected from 88,000 SPECS compounds used as an inactive background. One hundred and sixty eight descriptors were calculated based on binned distances between pharmacophore pairs, and an additional 12 physical property descriptors were added. The SPECS database of compounds was searched using the derived model, although filtered to ca. 50,000 compounds by comparing the latest version of the catalogue with a 1998 version and removing common (older) compounds. This was done to bias the compounds to those likely to be available. One thousand eight hundred and twenty one putative inhibitors were identified using the CART model, of which 100 were selected by diversity analysis. From these, 19 compounds were tested, of which 11 showed >50% at 10 \u03bcM and 7 were of interest as dual PDE1 and PDE5 inhibitors.",

Before the visualization of protein\u2013ligand interaction brought on by crystal structures, chemists working within a given series would \u2013 by trial and error \u2013 identify those parts of the molecule most associated with a desired biological activity [81-83]. Provided the pharmacophore remained constant, changes elsewhere in the molecule might modulate activity but often ensured that potency was retained with exceptions arising only when additional molecular fragments caused serious disruption. This idea can be further generalized; if a pharmacophore is satisfied by other functional groups, or by comparable groups or atoms arranged in a spatially comparable way on another scaffold, then the two classes of molecules might share similar biological activity. This precept \u2013 that even when 2D topology might not suggest a common pattern of features, the presence of required pharmacophoric elements in desired spatial geometry is sufficient to provide relevant biological activity \u2013 has powered and continues to power the contributions of computational modeling and VS to drug discovery and design, and is well reviewed in the literature and a few are included [84\u201389]. These ideas were then extended to searching a database of 3D structures for ligands that matched a 3D pharmacophore [90, 91]. These are the methods that are generally referred to by the \u201cpharmacophore-based VS\u201d shorthand. Implicit in some of the discussion about pharmacophore-based fingerprints above is that another use of the term \u201cpharmacophore\u201d is for any scheme that refers to a collection several atoms or functional groups to pharmacophore features without the 3D geometry being included. However, in this section, we will tend to focus on methods and case studies in which a 3D pharmacophore method was applied.",

However, as one could easily perceive, a collection of descriptors, which capture the characteristic elements, the charges, hydrophobic character and shape, can readily describe a 3D pharmacophore in finer detail. Such descriptors were deployed in modeling and design under the general umbrella of 3D QSAR and VS experiments were accomplished with a spectrum of variations that ranged from a simple collection of pharmacophoric binding elements to multidimensional QSAR.

The shape-based method from Open Eye, called ROCS [105] has emerged as a frequently used tool in the hands of industrial chemists [1]. ROCS relies on the conversion of a single molecule in a putative bioactive conformation into a series of Gaussian grid functions representing shape or atomic character. This probe is compared to similar information coming from a precomputed database of stored conformations, and a scaled similarity function is generated from either shape overlap or similarity of atomic character. Recent publications highlight the need to employ both types of information to ensure enriched screening lists [106]. This method is distinguished by its speed, reasonably simple command-line interface, parallelization, and robust behavior across multiple ligand classes.",

If trained on known ligands with three or more orders of magnitude of biological data, a robust activity prediction equation can often be generated. This function can be used as a scoring function in the subsequent VS experiment. Unlike a similarity function, this type of function can penalize for features that are already known to detract from biological activity. However, in the absence of such a scoring function, Catalyst can operate in a similarity scoring mode.

Inhibition of glucocorticoid overexpression may be effective in treating metabolic syndrome, and inhibition may also have a role in treating diabetes and muscle atrophy. Known selective 11-\u03b2 HSD1 inhibitors were used to train a model in Catalyst that contained a donor location, an acceptor location, and four hydrophobes. The ability to retrieve inhibitors was tested both using the known inhibitors against a random set of molecules (presumed inactive) and from the WDI database of approximately 63,000 compounds. A second model was generated from inhibitors that bound to both 11-\u03b2 HSD1 and 11-\u03b2 HSD2 and was tested in a similar way. The 2 pharmacophore models were used to search a database of about 1.8 million compounds assembled from 12 commercial databases. Hypothesis 1 returned approximately 20,000 hits, which were aggressively filtered using the Catalyst scoring function, lack of hit to a hERG pharmacophore, clogP <5, fewer than five donors and ten acceptors. Fifteen compounds remained and were available for purchase after filtering. The second hypothesis returned 107 hits, of which 15 were chosen for testing.

A commercial database of 718,000 compounds was aggressively clustered and filtered to 862 compounds. FlexS [124], a 3D similarity program, was then used to assess the similarity of these molecules to three known glucocorticoid receptor blockers. The filtering was needed as FlexS performs a flexible superposition and is comparatively slow. Because one of the query compounds was racemic, both enantiomers were built and used as query molecules. Conformational searches of the query molecules identified low energy conformations for each. From these searches, 123 compounds were identified, which were further narrowed to 18 by inspection and supplier considerations. Of these, one compound was reported to block the glucocorticoid receptor with a K\ni of 4.5 \u03bcM. Two rounds of similarity searching identified more potent analogues, the best of which had a K\ni of 16 nM in in vitro screening. This demonstrates the need to match the database to the computational capacity availability, the implicit value of inspection, and the value of follow-up similarity searching to rapidly fill out SAR.",

Based on the docked poses, a pharmacophore containing two hydrophobic locations, a donor atom, and one of two possible acceptor atom sites was defined, as well as regions of excluded volume. Lipinski filtering was applied, with the donor atom limit reduced to three and the acceptor atom limit reduced to seven. Flexible searches of the Maybridge and LeadQuest libraries were performed, which resulted in 34 compounds. These were reduced to 32 compounds by applying the Volsurf [125] permeability model.

Much has happened in the last two decades and a recent review, interestingly with the same researcher being the first author, gives a picture of the state of the art [130]. In the intervening 20 or so years, at least 50 docking programs and their variants have been developed. Docking has come of age and docking software available can in most cases reliably and quickly reproduce observed crystallographic binding modes of protein\u2013ligand complexes with RMS variations approaching the experimental error in the crystallographic experiment that characterized them. With robust docking tools and fast, cheap and plentiful computing power, it is a surprise that SBVS has not replaced experimental screening. In practice, however, several published and unpublished success stories notwithstanding, this still stays a challenge, to the point that successful SBVS is not as routine as one could have expected it to be per our outlook from a decade ago [131]. This is despite vigorous development of docking methods and scoring functions by the computational chemistry community for well over a decade chronicled in the representative set of citations here [21, 36, 132\u2013142].\n",

            "text": "Part of this disconnect between expectations and performance in SBVS originates from the way protein\u2013ligand interactions are quantitated to arrive at selecting the best pose of the small molecule in the receptor site rapidly, or the way the \u201cdocking problem is solved.\u201d These make approximations in correctly describing the entropy change upon binding, and free energy components such as free energy of solvation, in order to sample and evaluate rapidly a substantial number of conformations including multiple poses for each conformation of the small molecule in the receptor, assuming the receptor is held rigid, which is common in SBVS applications. When applied to the problem of choosing the correct docking pose for the same molecule, the changes in solvation and entropy tend to become negligible from pose to pose, leading to substantial success in selecting the best pose from amongst a set likely of the docked poses. This is only a generalization and can be influenced by the nature of the binding site, in terms of whether it is a site that deviates to the extremes of hydrophobic or hydrophilic character, whether there is potential for less or more protein movement, and whether the ligand in question has more or less rotatable bonds [135] resulting in one or more docking programs being better than another for a particular combination of receptor and ligand. In addition, most docking programs generate a series of poses that are relatively closely spaced in their \u201cdocking score\u201d, the pseudoenergy function used by the docking software to differentiate between poses of the same molecule in a given receptor site. The top ranked pose, the pose with the best \u201cdocking score\u201d might often actually be less similar to a crystallographically observed binding pose compared to a lower ranked pose and could be seen to be one with less binding energy when evaluated with a more accurate scoring function. This seemingly small error in choice of the best pose of a single molecule gets magnified and becomes substantial when the best docked poses of different molecules are compared, partly due to the breakdown in the comparability of the approximations in solvation and entropic terms across different ligands which can lead to incorrect rankings [171\u2013174]. One could venture to say that a consensus SBVS view today would be that the inability to rank a database of ligands in order of their potential for binding to a given receptor site has more to do with our inability to score the binding affinity of a series of ligands in their predicted pose reliably than our ability to predict a reasonably accurate binding pose [175]. To that extent, one of the strategies proposed for effective SBVS is to generate a set of poses for a large collection of molecules rapidly using a well approximated but fast \u201cdocking function\u201d and then rank with a more thorough but slower energy evaluation to rank molecules [176]. Extensive and continuing effort has focused on generating better scoring functions that better capture free energy differences between molecules, but can still operate fast enough to be of use to a high throughput docking experiment [175\u2013178]. Results of head to head comparisons of docking and scoring using multiple docking scoring software frequently suggested that different scoring functions could be more effective for different receptors and this led to the drive towards consensus scoring functions [179\u2013182].",

For SBVS applications, the two most relevant pieces of information on the docking software would be the speed of the docking software and quality of pose(s) obtained. A number of packages are available, many of which have been applied to structure-based VS experiments and with success. Among the earliest attempted were incremental construction approaches, wherein the program attempts to exhaustively position the largest fragment in as many locations as possible with the active site, followed by adding subsequent fragments with suitable torsions. DOCK, FlexX, Hammerhead, and eHits are amongst the software that use this approach. Monte Carlo approaches to sampling the pose and conformation of the ligand are used by QXP, ICM, and PRODOCK and these tend to be slower. Evolutionary algorithms that improvise on preferred poses are used by docking software like GOLD, EP Dock and FITTER. GLIDE software uses a rough sampling initially and follows with a refined search using a more sophisticated scoring scheme. Surflex-Dock also performs a rough docking simulation to obtain seed poses which are refined further with a more rigorous scoring scheme. By using sequential docking simulations of varying rigor, the sampling approximately mimics the outcome of a more intensive search. Most of the docking software mentioned could be used to dock anywhere from a few hundred to 10,000 molecules in reasonable time and depending upon availability of processing power and parallelizability of the application, could screen up to 100,000 molecules within days. If the task is to dock millions of molecules, then it becomes faster to precompute a set of conformations for each molecule and limit docking to positioning the rigid ligand in the active site of the receptor. The FRED software from OpenEye used in conjunction with Omega, the conformer generator also available from OpenEye, takes this approach. Flexibase/FLOG also share the precomputed database approach.",

To that end, several studies have been published over the years that compare a subset, usually the most commonly available, docking and scoring applications, in a head-to-head comparison using datasets containing known hits and decoys for receptors where structural information is available and the enrichment could be studied carefully [106, 135, 173, 174, 176, 183\u2013185]. If nothing else, these highlight the significant variation in performance of any package based on subtle variations in decisions about database construction, choice of data sets (both of active molecules and inactive decoys), program settings, and protein systems. In practice, most users rely on docking and scoring packages readily available to them, rather than try to find/use THAT ONE package that always works. The enrichment or the efficiency of the VS effort becomes more and more stringent as the proportion of compounds screened approaches 1% or less of the database of compounds screened. In these instances, for increasing the chances of success, one needs more than a protein structure, computing power, and software. Additional knowledge of the binding preferences of the active site in question can easily outstrip incremental advantages provided by one software over another and visual inspection and/or consensus approaches can aid in weeding out false positives effectively [21, 134].",

This is partly true, because in an SBVS experiment, due to the need for speed, the scoring functions do not perform a rigorous free energy calculation, and they will remain limited. Sampling, especially in situations where the ligand in question is increasingly complex with multiple rotatable bonds, can also be an issue. A significant other limitation is that generally only one protein structure is used, and held rigid. Movements of side chains or entire domains will not be modeled correctly and the extent an active site moves in response to a given ligand can be largely dependent on receptor mobility and ligand-dependent in addition to that. The resulting scores, whether fortuitously good or bad, will not be of the correct docked mode. In the latter case, even if appearing highly ranked in a hit list, this may be filtered out when inspected. Fortunately, there have been several attempts at addressing limited side chain mobility at least for situations of medium throughput and SBVS is becoming practical with inclusion of protein mobility [176, 186\u2013190].",

Glide docking was performed, and the top 2,500 compounds as defined by the Glide SP score were inspected individually for feature complementarity, and correct ionization.

Heme oxygenase is an essential enzyme for heme utilization by the bacteria and blocking its function should arrest bacterial growth. The protein complex including heme (1P3T) [198] was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with the heme removed to identify four suitable apo structures into which to dock the ligands. A database of 800,000 molecules was assembled from the supplier catalogues of Chembridge, Chemdiv, Maybridge, and SPECS. Compounds were docked into a single protein conformation to identify 50,000 molecules using the DOCK software. A second round of docking into all four representative protein conformations obtained from the molecular dynamics simulation allowed narrowing to the top 1,000 compounds (based on best docking score to any of the 4 protein conformations). This list was further narrowed by clustering and inspection, with 153 compounds being purchased for testing. Of the 153 compounds obtained, only 37 were soluble in DMSO or buffer, and of these, 10 interfered with the fluorescence polarization-based assay. Of the 27 tested, 8 exhibited inhibition of heme oxygenase with K\nd values ranging from 12 to 240 \u03bcM. This study demonstrates the value of a sequential VS strategy, and also the way in which experimental considerations (i.e., compound solubility) can limit the overall impact of a VS study.",

To give a simple example, if the curator errs and associates a wrong number with a molecule structure in the main database, regardless of how many other documents carry the correct information, people will repeatedly extract the wrong information because the association cannot be deciphered using NLP from other corporate documents. The rate of publishing is exploding, and curation is limiting.

In principle, the protein-based screen should provide the broadest access to novel chemotypes that could interact with the relevant binding site. The 2D ligand-based methods are often best at retrieving hits chemically similar (same or highly related scaffold, comparable pendant groups) to the query molecules. There have been efforts to develop measures of chemical similarity based on 2D graphs alone that better generalize the hits retrieved to compounds that include dissimilar but acceptable alternative scaffolds. However, these approaches tend to retrieve a large number of false positives; setting a similarity threshold to include these more dissimilar-but-acceptable hits often leads to the inclusion of far more dissimilar-but-unacceptable hits, leading to less enrichment. A third option has been the emergence of 3D similarity methods. These appear to provide a compromise leading to a balanced retrieval of both analogues and compounds containing alternative chemical scaffolds [1, 106].",

Clearly, in the absence of a protein crystal structure or acceptable homology model, ligand-based screening is the obvious option. At the other extreme, in the absence of known ligands, a protein-based screen could be contemplated. When one or more protein crystal structures are available, as well as a number of ligands that have been identified either from the literature or by some previous experimental effort, a priori, the all-out approach would be to bring to bear all available techniques to the problem. However, ligand-based screening often requires less preparation and less analysis of results, thus being sparing of the computational chemist's time and first one to get results out. Protein-based screening generally requires more time to prepare and validate the simulation, and to analyze the results, often including visual inspection to ensure that docked modes are acceptable. The choice of strategy then requires a balance between the enrichment that is expected, the anticipated novelty of the hits, and the time and effort available to invest in the effort.",

            "text": "As general guidance, we would suggest the following guidelines:\nInclude VS in a lead discovery strategy whenever possible. Computational VS is low cost. It is typically performed by a single scientist who employs multiple processors, typically LINUX clusters now available at commodity prices. Of the many resources needed in the drug discovery process, processor time belongs in the inexpensive category. VS also brings considerable benefit. Many of the methods available offer some enrichment over purely random screening, and often offer significant enrichment.\nTest a substantial number of compounds. VS methods generally offer enrichment, but most ranked hit lists contain a significant proportion of false positives. Hitlists should be scaled to 1\u20135% of the compounds in the virtual library screened. In many real world situations, the computational chemist is being asked to choose lists of compounds representing 0.1% or less of the compounds screened (e.g., the \u201cbest 100\u201d of 100,000 compounds). Typically, VS methods have been validated considering 1%, 5%, or 10% of the total number of compounds in the VS collection. By following up on more compounds, one increases the probability of impact from VS.\nInclude a 3D ligand-based method. In our internal efforts across two companies, we arrived at the same conclusion as the Merck researchers [106] that a 3D similarity method appears to offer a good balance between effort expended and the number and novelty of hits generated.\nAutomate. Much of the human effort in VS arises at the point of combining various hit lists, followed by scoring and selection. The more this can be automated, the more efficient the VS experiment becomes.\nIntegrate. An effective strategy is to view VS as an approach to identifying chemical matter that is complementary to wet methods. This opens up potential symbiosis between the VS benefiting from the HTS, or alternatively, HTS benefiting from early hits identified by VS. Such a complementary view cannot be overemphasized given that the role of VS in drug discovery is often looked upon as competitive with high throughput screening or focused subset screening. However, the lower cost and faster completion times should make VS acceptable even with lower enrichment numbers. The savings in cost and time to obtain a hitlist of active compounds can be significant if additional factors like the cost and time of adaptation of an assay for HTS purposes, compound depletion in the collection due to HTS, level of false positives from HTS created by mechanical and measurement errors are considered.\nWhenever possible, inspect the hitlist. Within the literature, there is a surprising number of instances in which small numbers of compounds were ultimately ordered. This inevitably requires individual inspection of compounds. In this situation, applying all relevant simulations and any hypotheses based on prior knowledge about key features are key contributors to higher enrichment. Where it is possible to order a larger VS hitlist for testing, some additional tolerance in favor of serendipity is beneficial. (For example, lowering the VDW radius of ligands or proteins to allow for possible protein motion or just ignoring small steric clashes.)\n",
