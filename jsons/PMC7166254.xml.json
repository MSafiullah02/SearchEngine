On the one hand, it seems that there is very little \u2018virtual\u2019 or \u2018digital\u2019 about it; instead, reality violently breaks in. This crisis, understood as an event, is not about otherworldly digital spaces or virtual worlds but about all too real bodies, viruses, face masks, ventilators, and coffins. It almost seems like reality takes revenge: \u2018You were fascinated by computers, the Internet, and your social media. But what does it all matter now, huh? Forget about your digital revolution and your ideas about new skills for a bright digital future; education should be about learning real skills such as medical care and something you thought belongs to another century: how to properly wash your hands.\u2019 The virus will help you to get rid of your obsession with numbers and theory.",

If we can go on with our lives and education, it is because\u2014thank god\u2014we still have these digital technologies. Again, we are taught a lesson: \u2018You (teacher, employer, politician) believed you have still years to implement digitalization in your organization, practices, and country.

It is only an apparent opposition; it can be resolved and this is how: Both points of view assume a false opposition between, on the one hand, a \u2018virtual\u2019 unreal sphere called the 'digital\u2019 and \u2018online\u2019 and, on the other hand, a \u2018real\u2019 sphere called \u2018analogue\u2019 and \u2018offline.\u2019 This metaphysics has been successfully criticized in both \u2018postdigital\u2019 studies and philosophy of technology. Postdigital scholars have argued that we no longer live in a world where digital technologies and media constitute \u2018a separate, virtual \u201cother\u201d to a \u201cnatural\u201d human and social life\u2019 (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018: 893). The technologies and media are taken for granted and hardly deserve a separate term anymore. Philosophers of technology have also defended the view that today there is no longer an opposition between a cyber world and a face-to-face experience and that the digital is now \u2018integrated and imbricated with our everyday actions and interactions,\u2019 as Andrew Feenberg (2019: 8) has recently argued in this journal. Similarly, Luciano Floridi (2015: 1) has coined the term \u2018onlife\u2019 to refer to \u2018the new experience of a hyperconnected reality within which it is no longer sensible to ask whether one may be online or offline.\u2019",

But there probably never even was a separate sphere or such an opposition between virtual and real in the first place, and it never has been sensible to make the online/offline distinction, at least if that distinction is supposed to have ontological significance. We have always been \u2018postdigital\u2019 from the beginning of the so-called digital revolution. When are using the Internet and \u2018online\u2019 media and technologies, \u2018we do not leave our bodies at home' (Coeckelbergh 2013: 13) and neither are we separate from others or from so-called external or offline reality; from a phenomenological and non-dualist point of view, our use of these media and technologies must be understood in terms of living experience that is embodied, social, and real. Platonic and modern dualisms are still very influential, but we can at least try to think in a way that goes beyond a dualist platonic split of the world into real and unreal.",

It presents us with challenges\u2014full stop\u2014and these challenges have to do with things that are immaterial and material, or both at the same time. They are also social challenges. The crisis is not only about numbers and statistics but also about material things such as masks and soap, about people and what they do together, and about the technologies and infrastructures we use\u2014as related to social interests. Science and technology studies (STS) scholars have done a good job to hammer down that point. Latour (1993) talks about \u2018hybrids.\u2019 We live in a hybrid world, and we have always done so. The Covid-19 crisis is an event that takes place within such a world. The problem is not that we must choose between the cave and the free world outside; the point is that there is no such platonic setup in the first place.",

            "text": "And here too it is important to take less dualist view. In Human Being @ Risk (2013), I offer an existential-phenomenological approach to argue that risk is neither an objective feature of the world or external state of affairs, nor something that we construct in our mind, but is constituted in the subject-object relation or goes beyond that subject-object binary altogether. I use the terms \u2018being vulnerable\u2019 and \u2018being at risk\u2019 to refer to the lived and active relation we have to the world, an openness to the world that puts us at risk and makes us vulnerable as humans-in-relation (Coeckelbergh 2013: 43). Technologies shape, transform, and mediate this; \u2018being at risk\u2019; that is, they shape our vulnerability and risk as lived and enacted risk that is neither purely subjective nor purely objective. From a philosophy of technology point of view, it is therefore important to consider how technologies we call \u2018digital,\u2019 and also other technologies such as material infrastructures, shape what we know about the crisis and \u2018the virus.\u2019 As philosophy of technology and media studies have shown, technologies and media always have non-instrumental roles and non-intended effects. This is also the case here. Think for instance how my experience of the crisis and Covid-19 is shaped by my participation in \u2018digital\u2019 social media. Such media do not merely \u2018communicate\u2019 about some kind of \u2018external\u2019 risk or \u2018thing\u2019; they also shape my being at risk as an experiencing being that actively relates to the world and to others.",

From a political-epistemological point of view, it is important to ask who defines what the crisis \u2018is,\u2019 who shapes the risk and defines the risk, and who decides about life and death. Covid-19 is not only a \u2018thing\u2019 but also reveals power relations in their full significance: the raw power exercised by governments when they take measures that restrict the freedom of people (and in some cases use the crisis to assume dictatorial powers) and also the less visible or more subtle power games that take place in hospitals, schools, and families. As Foucault (1980) argued, power is also present in all kinds of relations and hence is exercised by everyone. Medical professionals not only decide about life and death and make ethical decisions without ethical commissions but also define what we should know about the virus and discipline us, for example, with regard to hygiene. Teachers exercise surveillance and discipline and manipulate the behavior of their students through \u2018online\u2019 technologies. Power relations in families become more visible in times of lockdown.",
