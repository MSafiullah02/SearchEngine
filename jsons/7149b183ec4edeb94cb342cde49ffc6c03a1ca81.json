            "text": "Background There is an increasing body of research demonstrating stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue among those working in obstetrics and gynaecology. The literature is lacking with respect to targeted interventions aimed at improving staff wellbeing. Aims To investigate whether an intervention which increases support for staff is feasible to implement and effective at improving staff wellbeing. Methods This study was conducted in a tertiary university teaching maternity hospital. All doctors in training (DITs) (N = 28) and midwives (N = 69) working in the delivery suite were invited to participate. Wellbeing was assessed by measuring burnout, compassion fatigue, and perceived stress using validated questionnaires. These were distributed pre-intervention and 6 months after implementation of the interventions. The support interventions consisted of posters promoting self-care, team bonding sessions, and end of shift meetings. Results Eighteen (64%) DITs and 22 (31%) midwives returned pre-intervention questionnaires. Thirteen (18%) midwives retuned post-intervention questionnaires, of which five midwives (7%) returned both the pre-intervention questionnaire and the postintervention questionnaire. Eighty-seven percent of participants were experiencing emotional exhaustion pre-intervention. There was a statistically significant decrease in the Professional Quality of Life burnout score from pre-intervention (M = 25.8) to postintervention (M = 21.4), p = 0.02. End of shift meetings were discontinued after 5 weeks due to low attendance. End of shift meetings provided an opportunity for support and debriefing; however, the timing of these sessions impaired their long-term feasibility. Conclusion DITs and midwives of this sample are experiencing high levels of burnout and compassion fatigue. End of shift meetings for midwives and team bonding sessions for DITs may positively impact on wellbeing, but in current format, they are not feasible for long-term implementation. The low level of participation highlights a challenge in implementing institution-wide support interventions.",

Wellbeing and staff distress were assessed by measuring burnout, compassion fatigue, and perceived stress. A review of the literature was conducted to assess for validity of these scales. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess burnout; it includes subscale measures of burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction. The validity of MBI is well supported in the literature; it has a Cronbach alpha rating of 0.9 for emotional exhaustion, 0.76 for depersonalization, and 0.76 for personal accomplishment [2] . The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL) was used to assess compassion satisfaction; it included three subscale measures of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress; each subscale has a reported alpha reliability greater than 0.7 [21] . The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress. The PSS has a Cronbach alpha rating > 0.7 [22] . We developed a short additional post-intervention survey which included a free text section to provide feedback on the interventions (Appendix 1). The post-intervention survey was developed using expert opinion, supported by the use of participant evaluations completed in similar studies [23] .",

Having been discontinued after 5 weeks due to low attendance, we can conclude that BRecognise and Reflect^sessions were not feasible for long-term implementation. When studying the feedback, it became clear that having these sessions take place at the end of a 12-h shift had rendered them impractical for the long-term. Midwives reported being eager to return home and feeling Bexhausted and slow to talk^. This likely affected engagement and attendance. Due to lack of interest, only one DIT team bonding session was held, despite repeated efforts to organize subsequent sessions. No written feedback was obtained from the DITs; however, as these sessions were also held outside of rostered working hours, it is likely the low interest was again due to the timing of these sessions. The low levels of attendance in this study highlight an important challenge in creating effective and sustainable organization-wide support interventions. This study is one of the few that assesses feasibility of an intervention, particularly when implemented across an entire unit. Future research in this area needs to consider the long-term feasibility of their intervention when rolled out across a whole institution. Within the literature, healthcare professionals have reported not having enough time to spend with families, and those working in obstetrics and gynaecology are unsatisfied with their work-life balance, relative to other specialties [25, 26] . Limiting the time commitment out of rostered hours, and avoiding placing sessions at the end of a shift, needs to be considered when designing future interventions.",

Validated questionnaires were used. It also assessed the feasibility of an intervention when applied globally, as opposed to when only applied to a group that volunteer to participate in a study. This study has several limitations. The small sample size and poor response rate post-intervention significantly limits the ability to conclude on improvements in wellbeing following the intervention. The poor response rate warrants further discussion. Although participants were anonymized, it may reflect the sensitive nature of the questions in the survey. Another possible contributing factor was that surveys were distributed while the midwives were at work, and professional commitments were prioritized over completing the surveys. These explanations do not explain the lower response rate post-intervention. It is possible that the declining response rate may have been due to a decreased interest in the study following discontinuation of the BRecognise and Reflect^sessions. Further research investigating barriers to midwives completing surveys is needed. Another limitation was excluding the DITs from post-intervention data collection. It was felt that as no substantial intervention had been performed on this group, post-intervention follow-up would not contribute to this study.",
