For lentiviruses, it appears that in naive or even conventionally vaccinated hosts, typical adaptive immune responses are generally too little and too late to prevent infection (Keele and Estes 2011) . The healthy mucous membranes The V1/V2 domain of HIV-1 gp120 mediates binding to integrin a4b7 (a4b7) on CD4 + T-cells (Arthos et al. 2008 ). a4b7 has been termed the gut homing integrin (Wagner et al. 1996) . It is upregulated on lymphocytes in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, and then mediate, with chemokine receptors, the homing of these lymphocytes into gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) through interactions with its natural ligands, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), which appear on the gut endothelial cells (Bargatze et al. 1995) . N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs) of V1, V2 and V4 domains of viral gp120 remain unglycosylated and surprisingly potentiate the affinity for a4b7 integrin.

It has been shown that the contact with commensal microbiota results in the peripheral generation of T REG cells rather than pathogenic effectors. It has been observed that colonic T REG cells used T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) different from those used by T REG cells in other locations, implying an important role for local antigens in shaping the colonic T REG -cell population. Many of the local antigens seemed to be derived from commensal bacteria, on the basis of the in vitro reactivity of common colon T REG TCRs.

It has been suggested that the enrichment of CD4 + CD25 + T REG in decidua may explain the local mechanisms of immunological tolerance and play a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. T REG cells exert their function partly by secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-b1 (Zheng et al. 2004; Awasthi et al. 2007 ).

The vitamin A metabolites, including retinoic acid (RA), form ligands for retinoic acid-related nuclear receptors and together they play pleiotropic roles in various biological processes.

BK polyomavirus can infect several fetal organs, but was not found to be responsible for abortions (Boldorini et al. 2010 ). It has been revealed, that the herpes simplex type 1 and HCMV infection influence the expression of HLA-A and B antigens, but the expression of HLA-C and -G in the infected trophoblast cells decreases (Schust et al. 1999) . Exacerbation of herpes simplex virus infection during pregnancy is associated with damage to syncytiotrophoblast inflicted by herpesvirus either directly or via TNF-a (due to contact of NK lymphocytes with villus surface). A sharp decrease in the content of heat shock protein with a molecular weight of 70 kDa and activation of caspase-3 were noted in placenta homogenates. This may lead to disturbances in syncytiotrophoblast cytosol structure and increase the relative content of apoptotic nuclei (Lutsenko et al. 2010) . Human cytomegalovirus HCMV can infect villus trophoblasts in vitro and cause the decrease of early pregnancy villous EVT's invasive function (Tao et al. 2011) . Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is highly expressed in the placenta and is known to prevent maternal immune rejection. HCMV infection inhibited IDO activity in the early placenta. IFN-g-induced IDO activity was suppressed by HCMV in both early and term placenta. Early placental dysfunction through the inhibition of IDO activity may reveal a possible mechanism for miscarriages . Epstei-Barr virus (EBV) can replicate ex vivo in syncytiotrophoblast cells (T\u00f3th et al. 1997) . HCMV, HHSV, HHV-6, and-7 and B-19 parvovirus were found in samples taken from abortions or unexplained fetal death in utero (Al-Buhtori et al. 2011 ). Hepattis B virus (HBV) can replicate in trophoblast cells ex vivo . The presence of adeno-associated Dependovirus (AAV) in decidual or trophoblastic cells in cases of abortion implies that the virus could have causal association and abortion. The occurrence of AAV was found to be much higher the case of abortions than in the saples taken from intentional abortions (Pereira et al. 2010) . Human bocavirus (HBoV) seropositivity was found to be very frequent in pregnants, but this virus was not shown to harm the offspring (Enders et al. 2009 ). The globosid receptor for human parvovirus B-19 was found to be expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells (Wegner and Jordan 2004) . B-19 parvovirus was also found in samples taken from abortions or unexplained fetal death in utero (Al-Buhtori et al. 2011) . Human endogenous retrovirus W (HERV-W) was expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells, and the envelope proteins (syncytin 1 and 2) induce the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells (Malden et al. 2000; Mi et al. 2000; Blaise et al. 2005; Noorali et al. 2009; Vargas et al. 2009 ). Ex vivo, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA and a latent viral antigen were detected in placental samples from HHV-8seropositive women. These findings demonstrate that HHV-8, like other human herpesviruses, may infect placental cells in vitro and in vivo (Di Stefano et al. 2008) . Vertical transmission may occur through CD4 + endothelial tissues or CD4 + fetal Hofbauer cells. Trophoblasts and floating villi have CD4-receptors, which make them potential candidates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Placental cytokines and chemokines influence HIV replication in trophoblasts. Genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences verify the interaction of HIV-1 and placental tissue. The vertical transmission of HIV-1 characterized by selection of genotype variant that escape the mother's immune system (Vidricaire and Tremblay 2007; Al-Husaini 2009) . Interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor a were shown to potentiate HIV-1 replication in explants of syncytiotrophoblasts (B\u00e1csi et al. 2001) . HIVinfected women display different immunologic profiles from HIV-negative women, which may have importance for the induction of fetal-maternal tolerance and in part explain the increased risk of abortion in HIV-infected women (Kolte et al. 2011) . The presence of papillomaviruses in the cord blood shows, that these are also able to pass the maternal-fetal barrier (Hermonat et al. 1998; Younes et al. 2007 Younes et al. , 2009 You et al. 2008; Sarkola et al. 2008 ).

A total of 17 (0.07%) mothers of neonates with abnormalities and 25 (0.07%) mothers of neonates without defects were affected by genital warts during the study pregnancy indicating that papillomaviruses do not play a role in the development of fetal abnormalities (B\u00e1nhidy et al. 2010 ). West Nile virus was also able to multiply in trophoblast cells (Julander et al. 2006) . Human T-cell leukemiavirus (HTLV-1 and HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 6 (Csoma et al. 2002) . Coxsackieviruses can replicate in trophoblast cells, too (Euscher et al. 2001) . Measles virus was shown to replicate in the placenta in twins of unvaccinated mothers (Ohyama et al. 2001) . The different subgenera of rubellavirus were suggested to affect the fetuses i.e. the most isolates in France belonged to subgenus \"E\" (Vauloup-Fellous et al. 2010 ). Death of the mother and fetus, abortion, premature delivery, or death of a live-born baby soon after birth are common complications of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection during pregnancy (Smith 2001) .
