The second step in the assay employs reverse transcription and amplification using a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation. The assay therefore requires two kits, one for extraction and another for amplification of the target and detection. We investigated whether a strategy used in the testing of blood prior to transfusion could have application for conservation of scarce reagents for the SARS CoV-2 assay.4,5 The process of group testing that employs sample pooling is used for detection of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses4 in blood products. Key principles for successful application of group testing involve knowledge of the limit-of-detection, sensitivity, and specificity of the assay, and the prevalence of disease in the population. The goal of the process is to determine a pool size that provides the greatest conservation of resources while maintaining the reliable performance of testing. This report describes a proof-of-concept for group testing of pooled specimens for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

For 158 confirmed positive specimens that have been seen in the public health laboratory to date, the Ct values for N1 have averaged 26.06 with an SD of 5.5 (range, 15.75-37.96) and Ct values for N2 have averaged 26.48 with an SD of 5.8 (range, 15.75-38.65). Twenty-five pools of five specimens with each containing one positive patient were group tested for this study. Of these, the COVID-19 positive specimens were within a range of Ct values from 18.23 to 36.74 for N1 and from 17.33 to 37.43 for N2. Included in this evaluation, 14 specimens were selected with low RNA concentration (Ct > 30) Table 1.

The results showed that all 25 pooled specimens were positive within a range of 0 Ct to 5.03 Ct difference from the original samples (Table 1). To examine this approach in a clinical situation, 60 specimens from individuals at risk for COVID-19 as determined by the public health department were separated randomly into 12 pools, which were processed as described. Two of the pools were characterized as \u201c2019-nCoV detected\u201d by the assay. All individual specimens within each of the 2 identified pools were retested with 2 positive samples identified for an overall positive rate of 3.3%. The total reactions used were 22 for an overall conservation of 38 extraction kits and 38 amplification reagents.",

Therefore, strategies must be employed to closely monitor the use of pooling as the positive rate of test specimens increases in an outbreak of disease. Additionally, the impact of different extraction methods on the recovery of RNA and overall test sensitivity need to be evaluated. Therefore, laboratories must perform their own validation pool studies for kits used for each RNA extraction and amplification based on the prevalence rate of COVID-19 in their own region.
