The average Western, middle-class subject, for instance\u2014trained by media campaigns to be obsessively aware of all sorts of cancers\u2014is likely much more concerned about annual mammogram protocols, to name just one example, than the rampant staphylococcal infections in the hospitals that house many mammogram machines. In contrast to biopolitical imperatives surrounding the hygienic containment of infectious disease of the nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century, neoliberal health states have created an environment in which lifestyle, risk mitigation, pre-treatment, and optimization become the predominant modes to self-fashioning.2 Contagion, however, has certainly not gone away, even for Western states and in many ways has intruded upon these paradigms in the era of biomedicalization.3\n",

And, perhaps ironically, the characterization of the autism \u201cepidemic\u201d by the \u201canti-vaxx\u201d movement has ushered in the resurgence of highly infectious childhood diseases that had been controlled by vaccines for some time. It is no surprise, then, that infectious discourse paradoxically continues to intrinsically structure contemporary society even as much of industrialized society imaginatively constructs itself as beyond the pale of infection and serious contagious threats. Contagion is a \u201ccultural logic,\u201d to use Fredric Jameson\u2019s terms. If for Jameson, postmodernism was the cultural logic of a mode of capitalistic rationality, then contagion is a logic that serves dividing practices that subtend hermetic subjectivities, the distinction between self and other, and the supremacy and autonomy of the human. Often, this takes a biopolitical valence, based on what Foucault calls \u201cracism,\u201d (but which might more aptly be termed a hierarchy of life), where the human biological continuum is fragmented and categorized into those who are made to live at the expense of others who are allowed to die. On the one hand, Western cultures in many ways perceive that they have moved beyond contagious disease; on the other, they remain threatened by \u201cforeign\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d diseases. Furthermore, they expand the biological notion of contagion as a way to understand threats to seemingly all aspects of life. In this capacity, contagion still threatens certain lives whether it be by way of suicidality, chronic diseases such as cancer or obesity, or physical and financial productivity. In spite of First-World nationalism that imagines its subjects as immune to the threat of infectious disease, our post-postmodern, post-human, post-natural society nevertheless retains the structural paradigms of contagion and infection in discourses beyond biomedicine. We are strikingly not post-contagion.",

That is, our current social constructions rely on paradigms that represent nearly everything as communicable: fears (especially of non-contagious illnesses), media campaigns (such as Susan G. Komen\u2019s so-called \u201cpink-washing\u201d efforts), social activism (the pandemic spread of 5K philanthropy), viral videos and memes, and so forth. Beginning with the notion of the endemicity of epidemiological discourse, alongside the epidemiological spread of endemicity as a concept more broadly, this volume works toward a series of aims: (1) developing a theoretical structure for considering contagion as a paradigm that became a predominant mode of structuring and conceptualizing cultural phenomena following the solidification of germ theory in the late nineteenth century; (2) ensuring the interdisciplinary approach\u2014one that spans the range of humanistic perspectives, incorporating political, economic, philosophical, digital, and media developments\u2014of this framework, in keeping with the biotechnical and critical theoretical advancements seen in the last 15 years; (3) by way of the two former goals, beginning to interrogate the persistence of contagious rhetoric and logic in a society that has ideologically construed itself as impervious to infectious disease; and (4) advancing a bioethics of disease discourse that conceptualizes the overdetermination of contagion and considers both the implications of using contagion as a metaphor and its seeming \u201ccontagiousness,\u201d5 or, better, its endemicity.",

The advent of research on the microbiome and antibiotic-resistant infections, for instance, has significantly changed how we understand humans\u2019 relationship to microbial life. Moreover, recent research and popular media attention to how digital, social, and mobile media affect heath and behavior, while itself often characterized under the rubric of \u201cvirality,\u201d speaks to the timeliness of investigating how contagion is currently operating as a discourse and what kind of cultural work it is doing.

That is to say, it is framed as the form of contagion, whether pathogens or ideas, that emerges or, as it is frequently characterized, \u201cstrikes,\u201d a population, disrupting the social and biological status quo. This is best characterized in Priscilla Wald\u2019s (2008) landmark Contagious, in which she chronicles \u201cthe outbreak narrative,\u201d an emerging story of disease that \u201cdramatizes the most basic of human narratives: the necessity and danger of human contact\u201d (p. 2). Wald chronicles the plotting of epidemics from the case of Typhoid Mary to the Cold War era \u201cviral cultures\u201d to the turn-of-the-century Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, contending that this narrative shapes the material conditions of epidemiology. Much of this kind of cultural studies work began earlier with Laura Otis\u2019 (1999) Membranes and then, notably, with Alison Bashford and Claire Hooker\u2019s (2001) collection Contagion, both of which focus largely on histories and on biological contagion.6 Conversely, Peta Mitchell\u2019s (2014) \u201cmetaphorological\u201d study presents a history of contagion as a metaphor.7\n",

            "text": "The etymology of epidemic and endemic is useful here to distinguish the relationship between a communicable disease and its specific proximity to and influence on a population. The term epidemic originates from the Greek roots epi (\u201cupon\u201d or \u201cover\u201d) and demos (\u201cpeople\u201d). In other words, epidemics are diseases that come from without to intrude upon a people. The \u201cen\u201d prefix in endemic on the other hand, in its original meaning, is that which is \u201cin a people.\u201d Said differently, it is a regular condition of a population, if not characteristic of it. Contagion is itself, in its etymology\u2014\u201cto touch together\u201d\u2014and as a target of public health an inherently biopolitical concept, at least, according to Foucault, since the end of the eighteenth century. While we naturally think of this in terms of \u201cepidemics,\u201d from suicide to EVD, again, we might recall biopolitics in its genealogy is conceptually more aligned with endemicity:At the end of the eighteenth century, it was not epidemics that were the issue, but something else\u2014what might broadly be called endemics, or in other words, the form, nature, extension, duration, and intensity of the illnesses prevalent in a population. These were illnesses that were difficult to eradicate and that were not regarded as epidemics that caused more frequent deaths, but as permanent factors which\u2026sapped the population\u2019s strength, shortened the working week, wasted energy, and cost money\u2026In a word, illness as phenomena affecting a population. Death was no longer something that suddenly swooped down on life\u2014as in an epidemic. Death was now something permanent, something that slips into life, perpetually gnaws at it, diminishes it and weakens it. (Foucault 2003, p. 243)Today it is the lingering chronic illness, both figurative and metaphorical, that structures our cultural anxieties. The chronically ill citizen cannot contribute to a neoliberal society that prizes production, quotas, and stamina in the extreme social environment of the modern state that is increasingly devoid of social support for such \u201cproductivity.\u201d Making live and letting die become a question of calculating and calibrating endemicity and its effects. The victim of an epidemic disease, that is, at least functions in their death to relieve society of an unproductive member. The endemically ill linger and metaphorically contribute in the social imaginary to the troubling endemic conditions of \u201cwasted energy\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d which neoliberal actors seek to track, mitigate, and eliminate both in and beyond traditional disciplinary structures of the school, the prison, and the workplace.8 In the First World, this often translates to so-called \u201cdiseases of civilization\u201d such as hypertension, obesity, and drug abuse; however, we also suggest that this is not only indicative of endemics such as \u201cdiseases of civilization\u201d or microbial endemics such as TB in Africa but also indicative of how we perpetually tend to construct threats to governmentality as contagious, such as social-media-inspired suicide, financial collapse caught from Asian markets, or, emergent exotic disease such as EVD\u2014in short, how we construct an endemic of epidemics. We suggest that the discourse of endemicity stresses the particular dimensions surrounding the object described. It highlights how whatever is being described as \u201cendemic\u201d is characteristic of its context or milieu.",

In this capacity, whenever we are investigating contagion we are investigating subjectivity, particularly Western, liberal subjectivity\u2014that autonomous, self-contained, sealed-off self. The anxiogenic penetration that threatens the boundaries between the self and the other is based on the \u201cmembrane model,\u201d in which identity is constructed upon the ability to resist external influences and forces, which are often \u201cprojections of undesirable internal drives\u201d (Otis 1999, p. 7), a characteristic, for instance, of Western constructions of EVD as Catherine Belling suggests in her chapter; selfhood is compromised by the penetration of one\u2019s \u201cmembrane,\u201d in the form of pathogens or foreign ideas (Otis 1999, p. 7).

As Marget Pelling has suggested, \u201cContagion\u2019s capacity for excess has interested rather than frightened some in postmodernity, encouraging some to give up the dream [of hygienic containment]\u201d (Pelling 2001, p. 2). While many of the chapters that follow address contagion as virulence and threat, taken as a whole, Endemic resists the notion of contagion in its purely pathogenic connotations and invocation of the cordon sanitaire, following other critical and biopolitical theorizations of immunity such as those by Donna Haraway (1999) and more recently Roberto Esposito (2011). Contagion is a structuring tenet of our contemporary experience with the world and the various actors that reside therein. To this effect, as a theoretical apparatus, it both helps us reconsider how we assemble many of our worldviews and offers a way to challenge belief systems that result from the problematic effects of its deployment.",

And yet, there exists a number of other conditions that have influenced the use and understanding of contagion in our contemporary moment, many biological in nature: such as antibiotic resistance, the 2014 EVD outbreak, studies in the microbiome, and zoonotic outbreaks; while other \u201cnon-biological\u201d conditions such as the collapses of global markets, spread of fear pertaining to \u201cemerging diseases\u201d themselves, the increase and visibility of suicide, and the replicating, mimetic nature of school shootings have affected the facility to which we turn to contagion to explain threatening or socially destabilizing phenomena.

The reaction and construction of contagion often does this work. Despite the increased understanding of social phenomena under the logic of contagion, the biological has not been supplanted by contagion\u2019s different metaphoric iterations; our changing understanding of contagious disease continues to influence how we see other forms of propagating replication.",

However, as we have alluded to, this physical connectedness cannot but come with the burden of its own concomitant existential (and therefore spiritual, metaphysical, emotional, and symbolic) angst. Our volume seeks to represent this duality. To do anything otherwise risks building arguments on a set of misleading binaries. The point of this volume, therefore, is not to draw the lines between material and metaphorical contagion\u2014a line which any thinking critic must acknowledge has been blurry since the formation of the concept itself. No physical contagious contact arises without epistemological (and therefore, at least partially psychological and symbolic) recourse to its human, animal, or environmental source, and no reference to metaphoric contagion can exist without a concept of literal contagious disease.9 One is no more \u201creal\u201d than the other. Figurative contagion describes \u201creal\u201d influence and not only shapes our perception of reality but also has material effects. Said differently, contagion is about \u201cideas becoming flesh and flesh becoming ideas\u201d (Pelling 2001, p. 5). Even the explicit and intended use of the term as metaphor rather than description of a biological entity or process is, as Martin Pernick observes, historically contingent. In Greek and Roman times, for instance, the influence of religion, ideas, and love was thought to influence physical health (Pernick 2002). Moreover, the case has been made that such social and cultural influences have immunosuppressive effects (Blas and Sivasankara Kurup 2010). These perhaps seemingly discrete ontologies are, in fact, mutually constitutive, a foundational logic of the volume at hand, and we are firmly convinced that the possibilities which emerge from it urgently bear exploration.",

Increasingly, the findings of germ theory and bacteriology in the last decades of the nineteenth century reconfigured society in the collective imaginary as enmeshed in a veritable atmosphere of microorganisms that science had by this time revealed to be dwelling in and around everyone and everything. While germ theory had been suggested with some frequency as early as the 1840s, its period of intense debate began mostly in the 1860s, when groups of scientists began to experiment in earnest with attempts to prove or disprove the concept. Nevertheless, the so-called advent of germ theory is in part a misnomer because it was hardly the first moment during which contagious particles were theorized to cause disease. Individual scientific voices had proposed such methods of disease transmission even in ancient times.10 However, germ theory did not emerge as a theoretical pole backed by the authority of a contingency of scientists until the mid-nineteenth century. Prior to the rising popularity of germ theory in the mid-century, miasma theory (which in this early period was considered less of a theory than a given) prevailed. Miasma theory held that poisonous or polluted air, particularly to be found in specific sorts of \u201cunhealthy\u201d places, caused disease. The nomenclature of the then-infamous malaria (which means \u201cbad air\u201d) remains an artifact to miasma theory\u2019s predominance. By the 1880s, enough experimentation on the part of European scientists\u2014most notably Koch, Pasteur, Semmelweis, and Lister\u2014had proven to most other scientists as well as much of the lay public that germ theory was \u201ctrue.\u201d In this later period of germ theory\u2019s widespread acknowledgment as reality, the era of the \u201cmicrobe hunters\u201d (as Paul De Kruif\u2019s 1926 eponymous book terms it) arose. The era might less sensationalistically be termed the Bacteriological Age, in which a new generation of young scientists, trained in the ostensible verity of germ theory, sought to identify the specific microbes associated with various diseases. As preoccupation with contagion from the late nineteenth century forward indicated, a general sense of interdependence and interconnectedness was therefore increasingly at the forefront of social consciousness (Tomes 1998). As such, it is from the fin de si\u00e8cle forward that we survey how contagion has shaped culture.",

The first section \u201cContagious Culture and Cultural Contagion\u201d sets the stage for the three sections that follow by revealing the different ways that media forms\u2014prose, fiction, journalism, and cinema\u2014in the post-germ theory context became early agents in shaping discourse about contagion, and, simultaneously, were shaped by epidemiological rhetoric. This theoretical aim maps onto another that structures this section: the exploration of how other cultures threaten the contamination of one\u2019s own, a fear that, as Servitje\u2019s and Thibault\u2019s essays demonstrate, often marches in lockstep with the fear that one\u2019s own culture may be insidiously infecting itself with values that threaten hegemonic norms. Lorenzo Servitje\u2019s essay begins this first section with a discussion of Matthew Arnold, whose writings are synchronous with the early periods of germ theory\u2019s discussion and experimentation. His essay considers how Matthew Arnold\u2019s writings came to characterize \u201cmodern\u201d (American and British middle-class) culture as a pathogenic and contagious form that threatened to dissolve social order at the turn of the nineteenth century. He argues that Arnold\u2019s anxieties of the \u201cAnglo-Saxon contagion\u201d drew both from germ theory and fin-de-si\u00e8cle sociology to show how the beginning of cultural studies and liberal humanism was entangled with the discourse of contagion.",
