The genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs) referred to as ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 (Prikhodko et al., 2014). ORF2 encodes the capsid precursor protein, which is processed by the viral protease to release a small 124 amino acid protein called the leader of the capsid (LC) and the mature capsid protein (VP1). Comparative analysis of ORF2 sequences has been used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships among different FCV isolates (Prikhodko et al., 2014).",

Although synonymous codons encode for the same amino acid, their corresponding tRNAs may differ in relative abundance in the cell as well as the ribosome recognition speed, thus affecting the codon usage. The usage of synonymous codons is a non-random process with some codons being used more often than others (Mar\u00edn et al., 1989). This phenomenon which called \u2018codon usage bias\u2019, can be found in numerous species such as prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses (Liu et al., 2011). Codon usage is influenced by two major factors, natural selection and mutation bias (Gu et al., 2004). The codon usage between the virus and the host will affect the overall survival of the virus, the ability to evade the host immune system and evolution (Moratorio et al., 2013). Thus, understanding the codon usage of viruses can provide information about viral evolution and expand our understanding of the regulation of viral gene expression based on codon adoption. This can aid rational vaccine design to achieve efficient viral protein expression to induce long-lasting immunity.",

We found only one strain isolated from USA, one from Japan and one from Australia to sit near the standard values, suggesting that mutation pressure contributed to the codon usage bias of these three strains. PCA analysis revealed that mutation pressure is the dominant force shaping the codon usage of sequences isolated from North America (Fig. 3). Furthermore, analysis of the relationships between nucleotide composition and the codon contents at the third base positions suggested that mutation pressure is one of the factors in shaping the codon usage of FCV ORF2. Correlation analysis of Gravy, Aroma values and codon content (A3s, G3 s, C3s, U3 s and GC3s) showed that there is a correlation between Aroma and U3 s, G3 s and GC3s, confirming that natural selection contributes to the codon usage of the ORF2 gene of FCV.
