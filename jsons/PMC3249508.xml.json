            "text": "After cellular entry and genomic integration by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the HIV-1 Rev protein regulates the timing of viral gene expression that ensures completion of the viral life cycle.1, 2, 3 Rev functions in part by promoting the nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, resulting in the expression of the late-stage genes and providing genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. For this function, Rev overcomes cellular restrictions that prevent the nuclear export of incompletely processed RNA. Promotion of nuclear transport occurs through oligomeric binding of Rev on the Rev response element (RRE) (Fig. 1\n), a specific binding site within the viral RNA, which targets the RNA for nuclear export by the CRM-1 export receptor pathway. Specific oligomerization of Rev on the RRE involves well-defined oligomerization domains (OD 1 and OD 2 in Fig. 1a) involving a helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motif. However, it is unknown how viral RNA is released from nuclear retention sites, and it is not certain what other cellular factors are required for nuclear export of viral mRNA. Furthermore, Rev has also been linked to the translation of certain HIV-mRNAs4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and to encapsidation of the viral genome.6, 9, 10, 11, 12 The mechanisms of Rev activity in these functions and their required cellular factors are poorly understood. Furthermore, it remains to be determined how these Rev-accessory factors function in uninfected cells and how Rev utilizes their activities during infection.",

DEAD-box proteins commonly function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases, but the enzymatic activity of these proteins can vary widely.24, 25, 26 The typical DEAD-box protein contains a helicase core consisting of nine conserved motifs distributed between N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) RecA-like domains. Sequence diversity among DEAD-box proteins is found in N- and C-terminal extensions of the helicase core and in the flexible linker connecting the two RecA-like domains. DEAD-box proteins frequently bind nonspecifically to regions of double-stranded RNA and mediate conformational changes in the RNA in an ATP-dependent manner. RNA binding and conformational changes are coupled with protein conformational changes within the helicase core that are linked to a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. While this is a general model for activity, there is significant variability in RNA specificity and catalytic parameters of ATP hydrolysis among DEAD-box family members. Values of k\ncat and K\nm (ATP) can range over 2 orders of magnitude,24, 26 and therefore, understanding a particular DEAD-box protein requires study of its own catalytic parameters, as well as investigation of other cellular factors that contribute to its function.",

These RNAs included a 351-nt oligomer comprising the viral RRE sequence31 and a 35-nt oligomer representing stem IIB,32 the initial site of Rev binding33, 34 (Fig. 1). In addition, we describe quantitative measurements of both a Rev-dependent transactivation assay and a viral replication assay in cells where DDX1 is down-regulated by RNA interference. Collectively, the results of these experiments provide a clear link between DDX1, Rev function, and the HIV-1 lifecycle. Furthermore, they provide the most-detailed characterizations to date of molecular interactions with DDX1 and its enzymatic properties.

Western blotting with anti-Rev and anti-DDX1 clearly demonstrated that DDX1 and Rev were pulled down by anti-V5, whereas IgG did not adsorb either protein. Rev self-associates into higher-order oligomers through a helix\u2013turn\u2013helix oligomerization domain,38, 39 and oligomerization is proposed to contribute to both nuclear import of Rev from the cytoplasm1, 40 and nuclear export of Rev\u2013RRE complexes via the Crm1 pathway.2 Additionally, the first helix of the Rev oligomerization domain (OD 1) overlaps with the NIS (Fig. 1). The effects of mutations of apolar residues to polar residues within OD 1 (V16D and L18T) on the interaction between DDX1 and Rev were determined using the immunoprecipitation assay. The mutation I55N in (OD 2) (Fig. 1) was chosen because it is known to affect Rev oligomerization41, 42 while being outside of the NIS. The double mutation V16D/I55N was chosen because of its well-characterized effects on Rev oligomerization.41, 42 The V16D and I55N mutations highly attenuate oligomerization, and the double mutant protein remains primarily monomeric at micromolar concentrations.43 In contrast, the L18T mutation results in a protein that is less prone to oligomerize than wild-type Rev but is still capable of forming higher-order oligomers.41 The V16D, I55N, and V16D/I55N variants of Rev did not coimmunoprecipitate a significant quantity of DDX1 in the assay.

However, the L18T mutation within the NIS had a modest effect on DDX1 binding, while the I55N mutation outside of the NIS had a strong effect on DDX1 binding.

Hydrolysis curves presented in Fig. 5 indicate that k\nmax and K\napp (RNA) values for HIV-1-derived RNAs are similar within error, whereas tRNAphe is the less optimal RNA substrate for stimulating DDX1 ATPase activity than either RRE or stem IIB as k\nmax (tRNA) is 77% of k\nmax (RRE) and the K\napp (tRNA) was 10-fold larger than K\napp (RRE).

Taken together, these results indicate that DDX1 specifically promotes Rev-dependent expression of Gag in HeLa cells and that the effects of DDX1 silencing on gene expression are not the result of a general defect involving mRNA production or translation.",

Consistent with the transactivation assay, DDX1 silencing by both siRNAs decreased de novo virus particle production by 75% relative to controls (Fig. 7d).

This requires a clear link between DDX1, HIV-1 Rev, and discrete steps of HIV-1 replication. It also requires a validated system for further cell-based studies of DDX1 function and molecular interactions. Both siRNAs used in our experiments inhibited production of HIV in the infection assay. Additionally, these siRNAs inhibited expression of a reporter gene whose production was driven by Rev\u2013RRE but not expression of the same reporter driven by CTE. This effectively rules out off-target effects of the two siRNAs on general features of transcription, RNA metabolism, and translation. This approach, using two independent siRNAs that efficiently target DDX1 and that lack substantial nonspecific effects on gene expression, makes a decisive case for a role of DDX1 for HIV replication in the widely used model of HeLa cells.",

In addition to HIV-1, DDX1 plays a role in the progression of several human diseases. For example, DDX1 is overexpressed in retinoblastoma and has been found co-amplified with neuronal Myc in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumor specimens.30, 51 Overexpression of DDX1 has also been linked with stem cell-associated genes in human testicular germ cell tumors19 and as a prognostic marker for recurrence of breast cancer.52 Furthermore, DDX1 contributes to the life cycle of several viruses. It promotes the proliferation of human polyomavirus,53, 54 and it contributes to coronavirus replication in cell culture.55 DDX1 is also associated with the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the hepatitis C virus genome in human liver cells.23 Understanding of DDX1 functions and molecular mechanisms may have implications for the treatment of multiple diseases.

Under the conditions of the in vitro binding assay, the protein\u2013protein interaction between DDX1 and Rev occurs with a disassociation constant on the order of tens of nanomolar. While this is relatively tight for a protein\u2013protein interaction, it is considerably weaker than oligomeric binding of Rev on the RRE, which occurs in the sub-nanomolar range.41, 43, 48 The relative difference in these affinities is consistent with previous estimates from cell-based studies of the DDX1\u2013Rev interaction.14 These observations demonstrate that the purified RRE complexes containing both Rev and DDX1 are mediated through protein\u2013RNA contacts and not protein\u2013protein interactions. The lack of cooperativity between a protein\u2013protein interaction and RNA binding by Rev and DDX1 may result from sequestering the NIS within Rev oligomers on the RRE. Sequestering of protein\u2013protein interaction domains within the oligomeric and RNA binding interfaces could be a general method of regulating protein cofactor binding to Rev. For instance, the interaction between nuclear import factors and Rev has been observed to occur through interactions within the nuclear localization signal inside arginine-rich domain of RBD/OD 2.3, 56\n",

One possibility may be to prevent diffusion of Rev from the nucleus prior to binding on the RRE. At steady state, Rev displays a nuclear and nucleolar distribution in cells.34, 57 The diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of Rev observed in DDX1 silenced cells is very similar to the distribution that has been observed for double mutants containing the V16D variant of Rev58 and for Rev variants that have been constructed to lack the NIS sequence.59 It is possible that the disruption of the DDX1\u2013Rev interaction caused by the V16D mutation results in the same change in Rev localization that is observed in DDX1 silenced cells. Another possible function may be to assist in the formation of complexes containing Rev\u2013RRE RNA and DDX1. In the crowded and compartmentalized environment of the nucleus, a preloaded Rev\u2013RRE complex may have a kinetic advantage in forming the ternary complex. It is conceivable that Rev interaction with DDX1 could prevent other nonproductive interactions with competing cellular components or nonproductive Rev oligomers. The relatively tighter Rev\u2013RRE interaction could assist in disrupting the Rev\u2013DDX1 complex while still allowing for a productive Rev\u2013RRE\u2013DDX1 complex assembled through protein\u2013RNA interactions. In this manner, the Rev\u2013DDX1 complex could serve to specifically target DDX1 to unspliced and incompletely spliced HIV transcripts in the nucleus. This could promote CRM1-mediated export of the RRE-containing transcripts by several mechanisms, which could include hypothetical DDX1-facilitated release of the transcripts from nuclear retention sites. Notwithstanding our findings, it is possible that the in vitro system is missing levels of posttranslational regulation that could influence the relativity dissociation constants of the complex. All of these possibilities warrant further investigation, and the in vitro experiments using recombinant proteins and synthetic RNAs should be considered the first step in this process.",

Both V16D and I55N are highly disruptive of Rev secondary and tertiary structures.41 It is possible that disruptions of the helical structure of the oligomerization domain in these variants contributes more to the loss of interaction with DDX1 than is due to either the loss of specific residue contacts between Rev and DDX1 or the loss of Rev oligomerization.

            "text": "As recently outlined,24 several molecular mechanisms may account for the particular enzymatic properties of an individual DEAD-box protein. The simplest source of variability among DEAD-box proteins is differences in the structure and dynamics of the enzyme active sites that affect ATP binding primarily through conserved residues in the NTD. Additional residues in the N-terminal Q-motif also contribute to nucleotide recognition. DDX1 is unique among DEAD-box proteins due to the inclusion of an SPRY domain between the Q-motif and the NTD. It seems reasonable that the SPRY domain could dramatically alter the relationship between the NTD and Q-motif and therefore affect ATPase activity. However, because the rates and K\nm values for DDX1 are within the range of other DEAD-box proteins, structural differences in the active site are likely to be similar to those of other slow DEAD-box proteins and not due to a gross alteration of the protein conformation. It remains possible that specific protein cofactors could interact with the SPRY domain and induce conformational changes in DDX1 that result in a more optimal enzyme. As the list of possible cellular partners for DDX1 grows, it will be interesting to determine if this mechanism provides a means of regulating activity.",

            "text": "The enzymatic properties of DEAD-box proteins can also be highly dependent on the specificity for a particular RNA target. The most thoroughly studied examples are members of the DbpA subfamily whose optimal ATP hydrolysis occurs only with the 23S rRNA as a substrate.62 Because it had not been previously determined if RRE RNA was a specific substrate for DDX1, the ATPase activity was compared using two synthetic RNA constructs based on the RRE and tRNAphe as a nonspecific control at a single ATP concentration. There is a modest enhancement of k\nmax and a more significant decrease in K\napp (RNA) when HIV-1-derived RNAs are compared to the less optimal tRNAphe. tRNA is a highly structured RNA with a compact tertiary structure. In contrast, stem IIB consists only of short stretches of duplex RNA, bulged base pairs, and an unpaired loop. Given the modest k\nmax values for both RRE and stem IIB, it is likely that the enhancements seen for the HIV-1-derived RNAs reflect the difficulty in binding a highly folded tRNA as a substrate. The observed kinetics may also reflect a preference for either double-stranded or partially unpaired double-stranded substrate. Such a preference would be consistent with the recent observation of DDX1 cellular localization at the site of double-stranded DNA breaks that result from ionizing radiation.28\n",

Such cellular function has been suggested for Rok1p and Rrp3p in yeast ribosome biogenesis.24 Furthermore, eIF4AIII is a well-documented example that does not require ATP hydrolysis for its role as an accessory protein in the Exon Junction Complex.65, 66 Alternatively, the modest k\nmax value of DDX1 may reflect that of an enzyme requiring posttranslational modification for full activity. This would be consistent with the observation that epitope-tagged DDX1 purified from human cell culture was more active than E. coli purified DDX1.27 In either case, the enzymatic activity of recombinant DDX1 stimulated by Rev-bound RRE indicates that the recombinant enzyme retains some functionality of native DDX1.

Superimposed on this elution profile is the independent elution of the molecular mass standards used to calibrate the column (gray). The 158-kDa and 44-kDa standards are indicated by arrows. (b) DDX1 elution in 150 mM KCl at 25 \u00b0C. Peaks centered at 14-, 12-, and 11-ml retention times are consistent with monomeric DDX1, dimeric DDX1, and higher-order aggregates, respectively. (c) CD spectra of DDX1 in 500 mM KCl at 25 \u00b0C. The negative peaks near 210 nm and 219 nm are consistent with a protein containing mixed \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet secondary structure.

Both plasmids contain part of the 5\u2032-long terminal repeat and the coding region for the Gag and PR domains of HIV-1.
