            "text": "China's MMT programme refers to a national network of clinics providing daily oral doses of methadone to relieve narcotic craving whilst suppressing symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal (Ministry of Health, 2008). The method posits that by taking methadone, clients can lessen the frequency of heroin injection and thereby reduce the associated risks of disease transmission through unsafe injection. Advocates assert that MMT programmes also indirectly reduce drug-related criminal activity and improve social and employment stability (IHRD, 2008, Ministry of Health, 2008). Needle and/or syringe exchange as defined by Sullivan and Wu, refers to \u201cfixed locations including pharmacies, hospitals or designated needle exchange centres, from where IDU can obtain clean needles and syringes,\u201d and can also include the secondary exchange activities of injection equipment from machines or exchangers/peer leaders who deliver the products to IDU in the community (Hammett et al., 2007). Some NSEP provide additional services such as distribution of cotton, alcohol swabs, cookers; counselling on safer injection, wound care, and referrals to drug treatment programmes (Normand, Vlahov, & Moses, 1995). The rationale driving NSEP is that provision of sterile injection equipment can reduce the occurrence of unsafe equipment sharing that leads to the spread of blood borne diseases (Hagen & Thiede, 2000). Advocates also point out that NSEP can provide drug users in the community with educational and referral services. Since the 1990s there has been a consensus amongst the scientific community that NSEP can reduce the spread of HIV without increasing drug use (Goldstein, 1998, Henderson et al., 2003, Lurie and Drucker, 1997, National Institutes of Health, 1997, Remis et al., 1998, Watters et al., 1994, Wodak and Cooney, 2006). However, debate on this topic persists in policy circles both in China and in the West.",

Interviewees were from organisations contacted by the first two authors in the course of collecting preliminary data for epidemiological research grants to prevent transmission of blood borne diseases amongst IDU. Each stakeholder was informed that they could refrain from commenting on sensitive issues and that no personal identifying information would be used in the final report. Interviews were conducted by the first author between March 2008 and June 2009 and recorded as shorthand notes, which were later transcribed into a word processing programme to facilitate key term searches. A broad topic guide allowed for greater flexibility to explore a range of issues but helped to maintain a focus on differences between NSEP and MMT, roles of different government industries in China's harm reduction programmes, and suggestions for future programmes. Prior to intervention-specific questions, definitions of key interview terms were explained to each participant.",

The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Regulations of 2006 for example, urges various departments \u201cto take active and well prepared measures to implement community based drug-maintenance treatment\u201d (SCC, 2006a, SCC, 2006b), and the new Drug Prohibition Law enacted by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) in June 2008 (State Council, People's Republic of China, 2007) in which MMT is referred to more directly as \u201cmedical detoxification,\u201d signals unprecedented support within China's public security sector for methadone dispensation as part of China's drug control programme. In contrast, support for NSEP has been limited to provincial level statements, and as described by a behaviour change expert at NCAIDS, has never been codified as a part of national law as it is believed to be too controversial for national public security authorities to support (Liu, Sullivan, & Wu, 2007). Second, whereas MMT is administered by a centralised national working group under NCAIDS that includes representatives from the Ministry of Health (MOH), MPS, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) and the Yunnan Institute for Drug Abuse, NSEP lacks any such national coordinating mechanism. Instead, implementation of NSEP is delegated to individual programmes, who consult an NCAIDS-authored 150 page Implementation Guide on Needle Exchange Work (National Centre for AIDS/STD Control & Prevention [NCAIDS], 2007). Lastly, whereas MMT clinics are fully funded by central government as part of MOH subsidised services, 43% of all funding for NSEP in 2004 came from international organisations (Wu, Sullivan, Wang, Rotherham-Borus, & Detels, 2007b).",

The collective monetary resources and experience provided by these foreign organisations were pivotal in China's early NSEPs. By leveraging their programme funding and capitalising on the interest in public health following the 2003 SARS outbreak, these international organisations successfully forged alliances with health bureaus and police departments in high prevalence provinces including Yunnan, Guangxi, and Xinjiang (Hammett et al., 2003, Hammett et al., 2005, IHRD, 2008, Lurie and Drucker, 1997, Wu et al., 2007a). Although these programmes were implemented by local CDCs; management, evaluation, and dissemination of the largely positive results was overseen by the international organisations. A study of fifteen NSEP in southern China later found that those receiving funding from international agencies had higher rates of needle distribution and collection than those that had not (Henderson et al., 2003).",

The fact that most NSEP provided free injection equipment to clients conflicted directly with the interests of pharmacies which were an alternative access point. \u201cNeedle social marketing\u201d projects were developed as a compromise to allow IDU to bring used needles in exchange for vouchers for new needles at participating pharmacies, thus allowing NSEP funds to subsidise pharmacies for needles they provided to IDU. This pharmacy-based intervention strategy also shifted the debate away from the controversy of knowingly providing needles for injecting controlled substances and instead emphasised the opportunities for behavioural intervention created by the peer outreach components of NSEP (IHRD, 2008, SCC, 2006b\n; Watters et al., 1994). It would not be for another four years, however, that NCAIDS conducted the first scientific evaluation of needle social marketing, in which the largely favourable results were used to inform the development of national guidelines on NSEP (IHRD, 2008, SCC, 2006b\n; Sullivan & Wu, 2007). The legislation surrounding needle exchange in China therefore emerged ex post facto, following the demonstrated success of programmes that had operated in the legal void preceding formal recognition.",

Legalisation of government provision of a narcotic substance required determined lobbying by proponents to overcome factions opposed to MMT (Hammett et al., 2008). Several factors facilitated this, including existing scientific research demonstrating the efficacy of substitution treatment in reducing drug-related crime in addition to reducing HIV transmission (Gossop et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2007b), strong advocacy by public health \u2018champions,\u2019 (Hammett et al., 2008) and Hong Kong's relatively successful experience with MMT programmes (Newman & Whitehill, 1979). The fact that the scientific literature could demonstrate such programmes\u2019 ability to reduce drug-related crime allowed the public security sector to lend its support to MMT in a way they could not for NSEP. Furthermore inter-ministerial consensus was needed to pilot MMT because as a controlled substance methadone could only be distributed according to special measures dictated by relevant government agencies (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Security of China, & SFDA, 2006). The fact that the most contentious debates surrounding MMT were overcome before piloting began, established an early precedent for policy consensus amongst stakeholders and provided a consistent policy environment for later scale-up.",

However, its centralised policy making process and decentralised implementation process make consensus amongst the top leadership uniquely important for advancing new policies. The division of labour amongst the various departments overseeing harm reduction programmes further complicates the implementation process: MOH and SFDA oversee all blood testing and distribution of drugs and medical supplies. MPS operates all mandatory detoxification centres where individuals deemed addicted to drugs serve compulsory \u201ctreatment\u201d terms, and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) operates separate detention centres for individuals deemed \u2018addicts\u2019, who serve out longer sentences under the 2008 Drug Prohibition Law (Liu et al., 2007, SCC, 2007). Diverging goals amongst the responsible government agencies also drive decentralisation: whereas public health practitioners prioritise reducing the risk of infection from blood borne diseases amongst IDU, public security authorities are charged with enforcing laws against the sale and use of illicit drugs (Liu et al., 2007). As a result public security authorities have a more favourable view of MMT programmes, which are consistent with their stated aims of treating drug addiction as well as reducing demand for illicit drugs and incidence of drug-related crimes. In contrast they feel that NSEP address neither of these aims (Lurie and Drucker, 1997, Wu et al., 2007a).",

According to interviews with key informants at MMT clinics, to ensure the legality of government administered methadone, the national guidelines for MMT in China require the regular monitoring of clinic participants as well as mandatory testing for opiate use and annual disease monitoring for HIV, syphilis and HCV. Daily contact between methadone patients and MMT staff, inherent to clinic operations, allows for the collection of large amounts of data necessary for monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, routine testing of MMT clinic attendees can yield incidence rates of blood borne disease, which is the gold standard for evaluation of harm reduction programmes, in addition to measures of its impact on the illicit drug trade. A National Working Group evaluation report estimated that in 2008 alone, 3377 new HIV infections had been averted, 16.5 fewer tonnes of heroin had been consumed and that the illegal trade of heroin was reduced by 607 billion Chinese Yuan (Yin, 2009). Such reports provide a shared platform on which HIV prevention specialists and public security authorities can align their goals.",

Ideally NSEP would also collect information to capture changes in HIV transmission patterns amongst participants, but this would require active tracking of NSEP clients and regular HIV testing, a task currently only available through China CDC certified testing sites that require personal identification. Self-identification in association with needle exchange activity places participants at risk of arrest and undermines a central NSEP tenet of participant anonymity. As a result, existing reports on disease outcomes amongst NSEP participants have been limited to cross sectional surveys utilising complex methods (Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008, United States Centre for Disease Control, 2006). Other variables may proxy for measures of programme efficacy, such as participants\u2019 self-reported disease status or AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours (KAB) However, true leverage over China's policy makers may lie in what is perceived as scientific evidence of reduced HIV transmission without a commensurate rise in illicit drug use. Future evaluations of NSEP effects on HIV transmission may benefit from alternative observational designs such as ecological studies in which HIV incidence rates in regions with and without NSEPs can be used to quantify the potential effects of such programmes, though such designs must carefully control for potential confounders that may distort measures of programme effect on the outcome.",

This is due to the model of local self-reliance adopted during the economic liberalisation of the 1980 in which provincial governments were deliberately cut off from central support as a way to encourage optimisation of regional resources for economic growth (US CDC, 2006). Though an effective economic policy, such models have rendered many social services such as primary healthcare and education unaffordable for many Chinese, who must pay ever increasing fees. The fact that MMT clinics generate revenue by charging patients up to 10 RMB (about USD 1.60) per daily dose of methadone is significantly different from NSEP which do not provide tangible project returns. Whilst both types of programmes currently receive budgetary support from central agencies, a lack of financial sustainability for NSEP has not earned it any more support amongst central policy makers or local implementing officials.",

The NSEP do not require personal identification and can deliver services in the community and are therefore effective at accessing active IDU and difficult to reach populations who may for various reasons be ineligible or unwilling to access MMT. A referral system could also encourage harmonisation of data collection systems and improve overall knowledge of IDU behaviours. One limitation of an integrated system, however, would be the eligibility for MMT programme participation, which requires that individuals serve at least one term in a compulsory isolated drug treatment centre. Since this would limit referral services only to those IDU who have ever been arrested, the authors also recommend that MMT programme eligibility be extended to all voluntary participants who are deemed by a licenced physician at the MMT clinic to be suffering from opioid addiction. In addition, public security officials must be forbidden from access to patient information collected by MMT clinics in order to grant patients assurance that their personal security will not be threatened as a result of MMT attendance.",

The Chinese CDC has not approved these test kits for large scale testing because of inconsistent findings regarding test sensitivity and specificity (US CDC, 2008, 2006), and in order to minimise missed opportunities for post-test counselling and treatment referral, which is standard in the existing VCT system. As a method of primary screening and rapid surveillance work, however, oral tests are gaining credibility in the public health community to access mobile or underground populations because they can be conducted on-site and produce immediate test results. In the event that such test kits come into practice amongst NSEP in China, however, monitors will need to exercise caution so as not to minimise the self-selection bias that drove the debate over the Vancouver needle exchange study (Bruneau et al., 1997, Schetcher et al., 1999, Strathdee et al., 1997). If NSEP attendees are systematically higher risk IDU as in the case of the Vancouver study, if baseline rates of needle sharing are already high, and if exposure to HIV interventions is considered fixed for the duration of the study, multivariate model derived estimates may fail to control for residual confounding of the relationship between NSEP use and HIV status. Careful study design and unambiguous interpretation of findings will be essential for meaningful evaluation of NSEP.",
