Because COVID-19 is an acute inflammatory process, severely affected patients even have to withstand the blow of the resulting inflammatory storm, which manifests as fever, decreased appetite, and weight loss as an inevitable trend. Up to 44% of cases in Hubei Province are patients older than 60 years [4] . While some malnourishment stems from underlying illness, much is due simply to inadequate intake, which should be reversible if detected. Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) , Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), Mini Nutrition Assessment Shortcut (MNA-sf), and Nutrition Risk Index (NRI) are currently commonly used clinical nutrition screening methods [5] [6] [7] [8] . Previous studies have validated the role of these non-disease-specific nutritional risk screening (NRS) tools to identify nutritional risks in hospitalized patients with multiple diseases [9, 10] . However, little research had been reported on the use of these NRS tools for a specific disease: COVID-19, which has the potential to put patients at nutritional risk. To date, whether or not malnourished patients with COVID-19 have poor clinical results has also not been reported.",

The results suggested that the strength of agreement was moderate between NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI, fair between MUST, MNA-sf, and NRI, fair between MNA-sf and NRI, and poor between NRS 2002 and MUST (P < 0.01) ( Table 2) .",

In multivariate regression analysis, prolonged LOS, more hospital expenses, poorer appetite, and greater weight loss remained significantly associated with nutritional risk compared with patients who were not at risk after controlling for the relevant confounding factors. Agreement was strong between the NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI tools. Therefore, our findings suggest that the NRS 2002, MNAsf, and NRI are useful and practical tools for identifying older adult patients with COVID-19 who are at nutritional risk. COVID-19 not only manifests as pneumonia, but also includes dyspnea, severe respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure [4] . Patients often have fever manifestations, and some patients show anorexia, poor short-term appetite, weight loss, and malnutrition. Malnutrition interacted with infections in a vicious cycle whereby it not only increased the risk and severity of infections, but could also be a result of infection Fig. 1 Comparison of percentage of risk groups between each tools. *compared with NRS2002, P < 0.05, # compared with MUST, P < 0.05. [13] . The purpose of nutritional screening is to identify patients at nutritional risk, aiming to prevent further declines in nutritional status during hospitalization and, in turn, improve clinical outcomes. In this study, multivariate regression analysis revealed that prolonged LOS, more hospital expenses, poorer appetite, and greater weight loss were significantly associated with nutritional risk. Therefore, we recommend early intervention for patients with COVID-19 who are found to be at nutritional risk.",

Furthermore, 37, 68, and 61 patients with normal BMI (18.5 < BMI < 25), and 14, 34, and 33 overweight patients (BMI \u2265 25) as determined by MUST, MNA-sf, and NRI, respectively, were included in the nutritional risk group. This could indicate a poor match between anthropometric measurements and the risk classifications of the NRS tools. Previous studies also suggested that there was no correlation between BMI and clinical outcomes [14, 15] . Weight gain and weight loss are not reliable indicators of body composition changes due to fluid collection, such as ascites or body edema. In addition, people tend to lose muscle mass and gain fat as they get older. Therefore, patients with similar BMIs can have different nutritional status. ROC curve analysis in this study showed that NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI performed better than BMI in predicting worse-than-average clinical outcomes. Therefore, our findings indicate that, instead of basing nutritional assessments simply on height and weight, the NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI tools should be applied for screening all of the patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital.",

According to MUST criteria, if the patient was in an acute disease state, the patient was rated two points. All of the patients with COVID-19 were in an acute disease state, and thus they were all rated as two points or more. However, A MUST score greater than or equal to two points was considered high risk, so all of the patients had nutritional risk and could not be analyzed statistically. Therefore, we rated a score of two points as normal for statistical analysis in the study. These showed that MUST is not suitable for nutritional screening in patients with COVID-19. Further studies also should be done to explore the relationship Table 5 ROC curves in predicting worse-than-average clinical outcomes in NRS tools, BMI, and disease severity. between specific nutritional support in hospitalized COVID-19 patients found to be malnourished by the NRS tools and clinical outcomes, in order to determine which nutrition screening tools are more useful for patients with COVID-19.",
