I must admit that my mind is not foremost on sports law these days. Everyday private and professional concerns take a lot of energy and attention, and the uncertainty about the future is taxing. In comparison with these challenges, sports and legal issues relating to sports appear quite trivial. To the extent that I think about law, I foremost worry that that the corona crisis can be used as an excuse to roll back the rule of law. History warns us that authoritarians can exploit emergencies and that extreme measures justified by extreme circumstances in the short-term can be hard to remove and used as precedents in the future.\n",

            "text": "This is an unprecedented period in sports that no doubt will leave its mark on sports history. Essentially, all sporting events have been cancelled across the entire globe. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the UEFA EURO 2020 tournament, and the Copa America are a few of the major events that have been postponed so far. Meanwhile football, motorsports, basketball, baseball, tennis, rugby, and ice-hockey are some examples of sports where national and international competitions have been either cancelled or indefinitely suspended. In many sports, 2020 will mark the first time that champions were not crowned, at least since the end of World War II. The decision to effectively pause the entire world of sports in the interest of saving lives is undoubtedly the correct one. Things that seemed to matter mere weeks ago, such as Liverpool F.C. winning the Premier League or Paris Saint-Germain F.C. finally making it to a Champions League quarter-final, no longer do.\n",

One major motivation for following sports is that it for a brief period of time allows us to escape the struggles of everyday life.1While we should not use sports as an excuse for not doing all that we can, escapism is not necessarily or inherently bad. One of sports\u2019 many benefits is that fully devoting our attention to the competition offers relief and using sports for escapism can have psychological benefits.2Covid-19 has made it clear, perhaps more clear than ever before, what an important role sports play in many people\u2019s lives as fans, leagues, and broadcasters seek to fill the vacuum left. The great sports pause has provided an occasion for revisiting historic games and moments in sports history. It has also acted as an impetus for advanced experiments in the usefulness of electronic sports competitions, esports, as a stand-in for the physical kind.3",

Like other businesses, professional clubs\u2019 incomes have been drastically reduced. Most clubs and leagues are heavily reliant on sales of broadcasting rights. Rights and tickets have been sold to competitions that will never take place, and the significant resulting costs will need to be allocated. One business that will be thriving is lawyers specialized in force majeure. Clubs are trying to slash their costs, largely by reducing player and staff pay. While some are happy to contribute, some employees and employee unions may challenge the legality of these actions. With the support of sports governing bodies, government, and the public, most clubs will be able to meet their obligations, but some will likely not be able to overcome their economic challenges. It is conceivable that bankruptcies and the actions taken to avoid them will become the subject of legal actions in many sports and countries.\n",

Like other sectors, the sports economy is guaranteed to slow down, and this is particularly problematic in sports that are economically large and have grown quickly. One example of this is football where commentators have for some time warned about the signs of a bubble in the transfer market.5Clubs\u2019 needs to tighten their budgets are likely to hamper big-money transfers which, in turn, put a strain on the prevailing economic model.6 The ability to transfer players to other clubs for considerable fees constitutes a central element in many football clubs\u2019 business models. The growing football transfers market has in part been financed by clubs taking on debt from each other: in 2018, European clubs owed each other a total of \u20ac5.1 billion in transfer-related debt.7 As noted by UEFA, this is a vulnerability to the entire system: \u201cany delay or non-payment can have a knock-on effect on the carefully planned cash flow of many clubs along a chain of transfer balances\u201d.8 Also, \u201c[w]ith non-wage operating costs at such a high level, clubs obviously need to make profits from player transfers in order to balance their books\u201d.9",
