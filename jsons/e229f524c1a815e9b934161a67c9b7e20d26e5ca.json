            "text": "Trypanosomes are flagellated unicellular blood parasites transmitted by arthropod vectors. Some trypanosome species cause severe disease in humans and animals, while others produce either mild or unapparent infection, especially in mammalian reservoir hosts. 8 Mechanisms contributing to disease include systemic inflammation and anaemia caused by the intravascular organisms, and interstitial inflammation caused by organisms residing in perivascular locations. 8 The trypanosome host-parasite relationship is complex and varies with the strain and species of trypanosome, host species and, in some situations, the husbandry or environmental conditions. 8 In addition, trypanosome species that are usually non-pathogenic may occur in very large numbers in the blood of animals suffering from a primary, and usually immunosuppressive, disease. 8 Trypanosomes have been reported in a variety of Australian native mammals, including koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus), bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus; I. obesulus) and some species of bats (Pteropus alecto; Hipposideros ater), usually in the absence of clinical disease or lesions, although there is some evidence to suggest association with illness in native rats (Hydromys chrysogaster; Rattus fuscipes), woylies/brushtailed bettongs (Bettongia penicillata) and koalas. 4, 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of trypanosome infection associated with clinical disease in bats and involved a novel trypanosome. The finding of numerous organisms in the blood and lymphoid tissues of this bat, together with icterus and haemoglobinuric nephrosis, is consistent with trypanosomiasis as the cause of the haemolytic anaemia and clinically significant illness. The mild interstitial pneumonia and hepatic sinusoidal leucocytosis may reflect a systemic inflammatory process caused by trypanosomiasis.",

The trypanosome identified in the present study (total length 20.4-30.8 \u03bcm; width 1.3-2.3 \u03bcm) was longer than both T. pteropi and T. hipposideri. Unfortunately, genetic sequences for T. pteropi and T. hipposideri are not available and therefore cannot be compared with the novel trypanosome identified in the present study. Recently, a high prevalence of T. vegrandis was also identified in both microbat and megabat species in Australia. 13 The clinical effect of T. vegrandis in these bats has not been determined.",
