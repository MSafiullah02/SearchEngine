However, to work with highly contagious pathogens, it is necessary to take precautions against laboratory-acquired infection. We have learned many lessons from the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In order to develop an effective vaccine and diagnostic tools, we prepared UV-inactivated SARS coronavirus on a large scale under the strict Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) regulation. Our protocol for large-scale preparation of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV including virus expansion, titration, inactivation, and ultracentrifugation is applicable to any newly emerging virus we might encounter in the future.",

            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in southern China in November 2002. The causative agent was a novel coronavirus originating from wild animals in a live market [see reviews in (1,2)]. From November 2002 to July 2003, a cumulative total of more than 8098 probable SARS cases with more than 774 deaths were reported in 26 countries (http://www.wpro.who.int/sars/). However, after the epidemic appeared to be over, a laboratory-acquired SARS outbreak occurred in China in late March and mid-April, 2004, with one fatality. Although the outbreak was finally contained, the biosafety procedure in the laboratory conducting SARS research with live virus was cause for serious concern (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ sarsprepplan.html). Thus, these cases from China highlighted the risk of SARS transmission from laboratory-acquired infection and were a good reminder of the need to handle infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with great care.",

We have demonstrated that subcutaneously administered UV-inactivated SARS-CoV elicits a high level of IgG-type neutralizing antibodies and weak T-cell responses in mice (4). A whole virion is also useful, and sometimes necessary, for the analysis of immune response in vaccinated animals. Using UV-inactivated SARS-CoV, we established several monoclonal antibodies that recognize the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins (5), which is quite useful not only for basic research but also for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. Here we describe our protocol for the largescale preparation of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion under the strict Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) regulation.",

It is located in an isolated area on the third basement floor. The BSL3 laboratory area is further separated into several laboratories according on the pathogen being handled. As an example, the basic outline of BSL3 facilities and equipment in a laboratory working with SARS-CoV and other airborne viruses is described briefly below. 1 . Double doors and a controlled ventilation system that maintains a directional airflow into the laboratory with a visual monitoring device. The air supply is high-efficiency particulate air, HEPA filtered, and exhaust from the laboratory is discharged through an HEPA filter to the outside of the building. 2. Anteroom, pass box, and hand-washing station with hands-free controls. 3. Biological safety cabinet (class II, type B), autoclave, and centrifuge with capped (safety) bucket are specially designed. Basically, any liquid waste is sterilized by the autoclave of the BSL laboratory liquid-waste-treating system and drained into a storage tank for secondary decontamination. 4. Personal protective equipment (PPE) comprises disposable gloves, particulate filter masks, arm covers, closed-toed footwear, foot covers, and head coverings in addition to solid-front gowns and ethanol spray. These are located in the anteroom. Other supporting materials are kept in a common corridor space or a storage room.",
