COVID-19 infection is furiously spreading at an alarming rate, with a cumulative number of 116,736 confirmed cases and 5701 deaths outside China to date. As the earliest epidemic area, China has achieved a major victory in the cooperation of the people through the efforts of the government. At present, a total of 70,547 cases have been cured and discharged in China. In this outbreak, the elderly population is generally susceptible with high incidence of severe disease and mortality [2]. Community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly population has been found to result in decreased activities of daily living (ADL) and QoL, accompanied by decreased physical and mental function [3]. Respiratory disorders and lack of exercise in the elderly can lead to diseases such as apraxia syndrome and pulmonary infections [4]. Therefore, for elderly patients who suffered from COVID-19 and discharged with satisfying results, improved respiratory function is an important factor in maintaining ADL and QoL of the elderly.",
