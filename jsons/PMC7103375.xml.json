            "text": "As an early and crucial event upon infection, coronaviruses (CoV) such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in host cells and target their RTCs on the limiting membranes of these structures (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008, Gosert et al., 2002, Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008, Salonen et al., 2005). A recent analysis of SARS-CoV- and MHV-infected cells by electron tomography has revealed that these DMVs are part of a reticular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and contain double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in their interior (Knoops et al., 2008). The ER origin of the DMVs is supported by the finding that two nonstructural proteins (nsp3 and nsp4) with transmembrane segments that are part of the RTCs become N-glycosylated (Harcourt et al., 2004, Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007, Oostra et al., 2008). Moreover, nsp4 localizes to the ER when separately expressed and moves to the DMVs upon viral infection (Oostra et al., 2007). Whereas previous work has shown that the early secretory pathway and CoV-induced DMV biogenesis are closely connected (Knoops et al., 2010, Oostra et al., 2007, Verheije et al., 2008), the lack of ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), or Golgi protein markers in CoV-induced DMVs suggests that their biogenesis does not depend on the conventional routing of proteins through this transport pathway (Oostra et al., 2007, Snijder et al., 2006, Verheije et al., 2008). Thus, even though CoV must hijack ER-derived host cell membranes for replication, the precise origin of the DMV lipid bilayers, the host protein content, and the identity of the cellular factors essential for DMV formation remain mysterious (Knoops et al., 2008). The possible involvement of the autophagy machinery in the conversion of host membranes into DMVs has been reported. However, whereas Atg5, an essential component of the autophagy machinery (Mizushima et al., 2001, Yoshimori and Noda, 2008), has been shown to be dispensable for MHV replication (Zhao et al., 2007), contradictory immunofluorescence (IF) data report the presence (Prentice et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2007) or the absence (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008, Snijder et al., 2006) of the autophagosome protein marker LC3/Atg8 on DMVs (de Haan and Reggiori, 2008). In this study, we have used MHV, the virus prototype for the CoV biology investigation, to unveil the origin of the virus-induced DMVs and to identify host cell factors essential for CoV replication.",

Under normal growth conditions, therefore, the activity of the ERAD machinery must be maintained low to avoid premature interruption of folding programs and favor attainment of the native structure over degradation of immature polypeptides (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a). Consistently, it has been reported that EDEM1, a crucial regulator of ERAD (Molinari et al., 2003, Oda et al., 2003), is selectively cleared from the ER to tune down the ERAD activity (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a). This regulation mechanism has been named ERAD tuning. It relies on the selective sorting of EDEM1 and probably other short-living ER chaperones in 200\u2013800 nm vesicles called EDEMosomes. These vesicles, coated with nonlipidated LC3/Atg8 (LC3-I) (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a, Cal\u00ec et al., 2008b), emerge from the ER through a COPII coat-independent mechanism (Zuber et al., 2007) and deliver their content to endosomal compartments for disposal in a series of poorly characterized events (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a, Cal\u00ec et al., 2008b, Le Fourn et al., 2009, Zuber et al., 2007).",

In doing so, MHV interferes with the degradation of EDEM1 and OS-9, another short-living chaperone that we identify here as a second EDEMosome cargo, by trapping them into the DMVs. Our data are consistent with the model in which DMVs are generated from the host ER (Knoops et al., 2008) and explain the absence of conventional ER resident chaperones in their interior. In addition, we show that, whereas the autophagy pathway is not essential for MHV infection, nonlipidated LC3-I coats CoV-induced DMVs and is essential for MHV replication.",

IF analysis of two RTC components, nsp2 and nsp3, in MHV-infected wild-type (Atg7\n+/+) and ATG7 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF) revealed that these two proteins were similarly distributed to numerous punctuate structures in both cell lines (Figure 1A). These puncta represent the virus-induced DMVs that contain viral dsRNA (colocalization in Figure 1A; Harcourt et al., 2004, Knoops et al., 2008). The presence in both Atg7\n+/+ and Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF of these double-membrane structures with a diameter of approximately 200\u2013350 nm (Knoops et al., 2008, Stertz et al., 2007) was confirmed by conventional electron microscopy (Figure 1B). Moreover, cells with and without ATG7 were equally susceptible to MHV infection. This was established by assessing the virus replication using a recombinant luciferase-expressing MHV (Figure 1C) and by determining the titer of a virus stock on these cells by using the mean tissue culture infection dose (TCID50) test (Figure 1D). MHV replication in Atg7\n+/+ and Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF during the course of an infection was also very similar (Figure 1E). Thus, the conventional host cell autophagy is not required for formation of MHV-induced DMVs, nor for viral replication and production of viral progeny.",

The lipidation of LC3-I and the formation of LC3-II-coated autophagosomes require several proteins, including Atg7 (Komatsu et al., 2005). However, Atg7 was not necessary for the association of endogenous LC3 to DMVs (Figure 2D and 2E). Consequently, Atg7 and LC3 lipidation are not essential for the formation of LC3-positive DMVs. Analysis of the protein content in DMVs induced upon MHV-nsp2GFP infection of HeLa cells and separated on continuous density gradients as described (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a) showed the presence of LC3-I in the denser fractions containing the DMV protein marker nsp2-GFP (Figure 2F). These fractions were clearly separated from the lighter autophagosomes containing LC3-II that floated at the top of the gradient. Moreover, IF analyses revealed that ectopically expressed C-terminally HA-tagged, nonlipidable LC3 localizes on DMVs (Figure 2G). Taken all together, these data show that an intact host autophagy machinery is dispensable for the virus life cycle and that lipidation is not required for LC3 association with the DMV membranes.",

            "text": "As in the case of formation of the ER-derived, CoV-induced DMVs, it is unclear whether an active autophagy machinery is required for formation of ER-derived EDEMosomes and/or for disposal of EDEM1 (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a versus Le Fourn et al., 2009). To better understand this, we compared variations in the intracellular levels of EDEM1 and of p62, a canonical substrate of autophagy (Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y et al., 2005), under conditions that either inactivate, e.g., ATG7 deletion (Figures 3A and 3B) or cell incubation with chloroquine (CQ) (Figures 3C and 3D) (Klionsky et al., 2008, Komatsu et al., 2005) or activate autophagy, e.g., rapamycin treatment (Figures 3C and 3D) (Klionsky et al., 2008). Deletion of ATG7 inhibits the p62 turnover (Waguri and Komatsu, 2009), thus substantially increasing the intracellular level of this autophagy substrate (Figure 3A). On the contrary, deletion of ATG7 did not result in substantial variations of the level of EDEM1 (Figure 3A), thus showing that Atg7 and conventional autophagy are dispensable for EDEM1 turnover. Consistently, when wild-type and Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF were metabolically radiolabeled and chased for 10\u201390 min, the amount of residual endogenous EDEM1 decreased with similar kinetics in the two cell lines, confirming similar rate of disposal in the presence or absence of Atg7 (Figure 3B). Cell exposure to CQ inhibited the p62 degradation, resulting in higher levels of this protein, as expected for an autophagy substrate (Figure 3C; Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y et al., 2009). CQ delayed EDEM1 turnover and resulted in intracellular accumulation of EDEM1 (Figures 3C and 3D; Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a). Finally, induction of autophagy with rapamycin reduced the intracellular levels of p62, as expected for an autophagy substrate (Figure 3C; Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y et al., 2009), but increased those of EDEM1 (Figure 3C) by delaying its turnover (Figure 3D). These results confirmed that, as reported above for CoV replication, the pathway regulating EDEM1 turnover is clearly distinct from autophagy. They also highlight another analogy between the ERAD tuning pathway and the CoV infection. Cell exposure to the autophagy-inducer rapamycin negatively affected both EDEM1 turnover (Figures 3C and 3D) and MHV replication, as shown by measuring the levels of both the N nucleocapsid levels and luciferase in cells infected with the recombinant luciferase-expressing MHV (Figure S2). All together, these observations led us to hypothesize that MHV hijacks the ERAD tuning machinery to co-opt cellular membranes for DMV generation.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, despite their ER origin (Knoops et al., 2008, Zuber et al., 2007), CoV-induced DMVs and EDEMosomes do not contain conventional ER chaperones or protein markers of the early compartments of the secretory pathway (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a, Oostra et al., 2007, Snijder et al., 2006, Stertz et al., 2007, Verheije et al., 2008). By IF analysis of MHV-infected wild-type and Atg7\u2212/\u2212 knockout cells, we systematically assessed the presence in DMVs of several conventional protein markers of the early compartment of the secretory pathway, essentially confirming that none of them were in the virus-induced DMVs (Figure S3A and data not shown). Only two antibodies stained the virus-induced dsRNA- or nsp2/nsp3-positive compartments, namely those recognizing EDEM1 and OS-9 (Figures 3E and 3F). The presence of EDEM1 during the entire course of the infection (Figures S3B and S3C) confirmed our working model postulating that CoV hijack the ERAD tuning pathway to promote formation of their DMVs. Our model was further corroborated by the observation that cell infection with MHV substantially interfered with ERAD tuning, thus causing intracellular accumulation of EDEM1 and OS-9 (Figure 3H) due to the relocalization and confinement of these chaperones into the lasting MHV-induced DMVs (Figures 2F, 3E, 3F, S3B, and S3C). In noninfected cells, EDEM1 has a half-life of about 60 min (Figures 3B and 3D; Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a). Because MHV infection induces a host translational shutoff (Raaben et al., 2007), the persistence of EDEM1 (and OS-9) for several hours confirms the defective clearance of this protein in infected cells (Figures 3H, S3B, and S3C). Entrapping of a fraction of cellular OS-9 in the DMVs was unexpected but significant. Like EDEM1, OS-9 is a regulator of protein disposal from the ER and it is expressed in two splice variants, OS-9.1 and OS-9.2 (Bernasconi et al., 2008, Christianson et al., 2008). Immunodetection of OS-9 in the MHV-induced DMVs (Figures 3F and 3G) led us to verify by subcellular fractionation whether OS-9 localizes to the same LC3-I-positive vesicular structures containing EDEM1 in noninfected cells (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a). Our analysis showed that, at steady state, about 20% of OS-9.1 and a smaller amount of OS-9.2 were indeed found in LC3-I-positive EDEMosomes, which sedimented in fractions 7\u20139 of a continuous Optiprep gradient, whereas other conventional ER chaperones were fully excluded from these fractions (Figure S3D; Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a).",

We therefore verified whether LC3 is required for viral replication even though the autophagy protein Atg7, which is required for its covalent membrane association, is dispensable (Figure 1). Efficient depletion of LC3A and LC3B was obtained by specific RNA interference (Figure 4A). LC3 downregulation protected cells from MHV infection as assessed by inhibition of the synthesis of the structural N protein (Figure 4A) and by a substantial decrease in luciferase levels measured in both single time point and time-course experiments (Figures 4B and 4C). The inhibition of MHV replication observed in LC3 knockdown cells was caused by a defect in DMV biogenesis, as no nsp2 and nsp3 signal was detected by IF (Figure 4D). The initial DMVs and RTCs generated upon MHV infection are necessary for the massive synthesis of extra nsp proteins, which, in turn, leads to the formation of a multitude of additional DMVs and RTCs. Consequently, a defect in DMV biogenesis results in a severe block of nsp production. Crucially, back transfection of LC3 knockdown cells with the plasmid-expressing C-terminally HA-tagged, nonlipidable LC3 restored MHV replication measured by monitoring N protein synthesis (Figure 4E).",

Accordingly to what is known about other vesicular transport pathways (Sato and Nakano, 2007), we postulate that the EDEMosome cargo receptor interacts with subunits of a cytosolic vesicle protein coat (nonlipidated LC3-I seems a good candidate). It is unlikely that the viral nsps recruit LC3-I at the cytosolic surface of DMVs because LC3-I is associated to EDEMosomes in uninfected cells (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008a) and because we have not found direct interaction between nsp and LC3-I (unpublished data). Astonishingly, whereas EDEMosomes are transient structures that end their journey in late endosomes and/or lysosomes, MHV-induced DMVs are persistent cytoplasmic organelles (Ulasli et al., in press). Therefore, the presence of either nsps or other viral products inhibits the fusion of EDEMosomes/DMVs with the degradative compartments of the endosomal system. A main goal of future research is the identification of the elusive EDEMosome cargo receptor and the characterization of its involvement in CoV infection. It also remains to be established whether the ERAD tuning and CoV infection share mechanistic analogies with the recently characterized Atg5/Atg7-independent type of autophagy (Nishida et al., 2009). Importantly, in our study, we also show that blocking DMV formation by depleting LC3 severely impairs MHV infection. Consequently, future investigations on the involvement of viral proteins and ERAD tuning components, as well as the unconventional intervention of certain factors of the host cell autophagy machinery in the formation of CoV-induced DMVs, might provide valuable therapeutic targets.",

Repetition of the analysis showed no significant differences in the EDEM1 level in Atg7+/+ versus Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF. The percentages (right) indicate the relative EDEM1 levels in the knockout cells compared to wild-type cells and represent the average of two experiments. (B) Atg7+/+ and Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF were metabolically labeled and chased for the times indicated before lysis and EDEM1 immuno-isolation. The residual radiolabeled EDEM1 present in each lane was quantified and indicated below each band. Repetition of the analysis showed no significant differences in the EDEM1 turnover in Atg7+/+ versus Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF. (C) Atg7+/+ MEF were untreated or treated with 100 mM CQ or 1 mM rapamycin (rap) for 4 hr before preparation of cell extracts and analysis as in (A). The percentages (right) indicate the relative EDEM1 levels in drug-treated cells compared to mock-treated cells and represent the average of two experiments. (D) Same as (B) to confirm, in a pulse-chase radiolabeling experiment, that CQ and rap delay EDEM1 turnover. (E and F) HeLa cells were infected with MHV-Srec and processed for IF at 7 hr p.i. using antibodies against dsRNA and (E) EDEM1 or (F) OS-9. (G) Atg7+/+ and Atg7\u2212/\u2212 MEF infected with MHV-Srec were fixed at 7 hr p.i. and processed for IF using antibodies against OS-9 and dsRNA. (H) Cell extracts were analyzed by western blot using antibodies against EDEM1 or OS-9. The percentages (right) indicate the relative EDEM1 and OS-9 levels in infected cells compared to control cells and represent the average of two experiments. See also Figures S2, S3, and S4.",

After 48 hr, cells were infected with MHV-2aFLS and analyzed at 7 hr p.i. This analysis has been repeated five times. (A) Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using antibodies against the N protein, LC3, and actin. The percentage indicates the relative N protein levels in LC3-depleted cells compared to control cells and represent the average of three experiments. (B) Luciferase activity was measured as described in the Experimental Procedures, and error bars indicate the standard deviations for an experiment made in triplicate. (C) The experiment described in (B) was repeated three times in a time course manner, and luciferase expression was determined at 5, 7, and 10 hr p.i. Error bars represent the standard deviations between experiments. (D) Localization of nsp2/nsp3 and LC3 was examined by IF in cells treated as in (A) and (B). (E) HeLa-CEACAM1a cells were transfected with either siRNA directed against LC3A and LC3B (siLC3) or nontargeting (siSCR) siRNA. After 24 hr, one of the samples was transfected with a plasmid expressing C-terminally HA-tagged, nonlipidable LC3, and MHV was inoculated at 48 hr. Cell lysates were prepared at 7 hr p.i. and analyzed by western blot using antibodies against the N protein, LC3, HA, and actin. Note that the higher levels of LC3-I in the siLC3+LC3-HA lane are due to LC3-HA, which run as LC3-I in the used SDS-PAGE gel.",
