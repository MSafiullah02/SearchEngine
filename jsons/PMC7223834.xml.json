            "text": "To date, just a limited number of controlled animal studies have been carried out in this field. In particular, some authors demonstrated the anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antioxidant, and chondroprotective properties of BT, principally reducing cytokines and free radical production, and decreasing the mechanical hyperalgesia and edema in different murine models of arthritis or psoriasis (Abu-al-Basal 2012; Bajgai et al. 2017; Britschka et al. 2007; Cozzi et al. 2004; T\u00e9kus et al. 2018; Zivn\u00e1 et al. 2012). Some aspects of these studies are disputable and could represent a source of bias. Indeed, comparisons among the various studies are difficult principally because of the difference in type and length of interventions, and, in certain cases, the combinations of treatment modalities. The problem in working with animals is mainly related to economical problems, to establish a specific model for a particular disease and to find the most suitable application routine of BT or the protocol of mud treatment (T\u00e9kus et al. 2018). Furthermore, the restraint conditions at which the animals are subjected for the treatments may exert stress reactions that can influence the experimental outcomes (Scheich et al. 2017; T\u00e9kus et al. 2016).",

At this regard, nanomolar levels of Na2S and GYY4137 (50\u2013500 nM) were employed to treat primary mouse T lymphocytes (CD3+) and OT-II CD4+ T cells at time points of 4, 10, and 24 h to establish whether endogenous H2S production is required for T cell activation, in mediating inflammatory response in such kind of diseases (Miller et al. 2012). H2S donors enhanced T cell activation assessed by CD69 expression, IL-2 expression, and CD25 levels, with a maximum capacity at 300 nM. Besides, activation increased the capacity of T cells to synthesize endogenous amounts of H2S via increased expression of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase and cystathionine \u03b2-synthase. These findings lead to define H2S as an endogenous and exogenous immunomodulatory molecule in T cells signal (Table 3).",

Thermal water or NaHS was added to the culture medium of the cells for 24 h in the presence or not of 100 ng/mL of LPS, then the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the formation of ROS were evaluated. NaHS efficiently blocked the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, CXCL8, and CCL5 induced by LPS, and limited ROS formation and antioxidant enzymes activity; Sirmione water did not induced the same results, but only enhanced the release of IL-10, probably due to the low concentration of S-based compounds reached at its non-toxic dilution. The Authors attested the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of S-based compounds against the main manifestation of chronic inflammatory and age-related illness (Table 3).",

H2S sources seem to counteract the inflammatory processes both in arthritic fibroblast-like synoviocytes and chondrocytes, and in OA chondrocytes (Burguera et al. 2014; Fox et al. 2012; Ha et al. 2015; Kloesch et al. 2010; Kloesch et al. 2012a; Kloesch et al. 2012b; Li et al. 2013; Sieghart et al. 2015).

The ability of H2S donors to limit the oxidative stress damage was also confirmed in human primary or transformed cell lines of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (Gambari et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017; Lv et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2011).",

Although the high experimental repeatability and reproducibility of standardized and immortalized cell lines, primary cultures should be preferred to be carried out in in vitro studies since they are directly derived from the original tissue, and are heterogeneous and significant in terms of being the closest forms of the state of the cells that they represent in physiological or pathological tissues (Isyar et al. 2016). In any case, it is needed to keep in mind that primary cells have a limited lifespan and they stop dividing after a certain number of cell divisions and can be difficult to culture and maintain. The heterogeneity induced by the isolation of the cells from different donors could represent a source of experimental variability. Thus, the identification of the most suitable cell model for a specific pathological state, together with the maintenance of the optimal culture conditions, is required to obtain the best in vitro results, limiting possible bias (Khan and Gasser 2016).",

Taken together, the results of our analysis show that the in vitro studies take the advantage to represent simplified biological systems, useful to improve the knowledge about the potential mechanism of action of mineral water, tested as a whole or as singular mineral element or as organic fraction, at the molecular level. However, the usefulness of the culture models is limited by several sources of bias. Their validity is conditioned by a correct experimental procedure, which should take into consideration the particular and complex composition of mineral waters. Nowadays, analyzing the effects of the only inorganic composition of thermal waters is not enough, but it is necessary to perform a complex chemical analysis which should also consider their organic fraction that may play a role in the therapeutic efficacy or in other biological mechanisms as toxicity (Varga 2016). Another important critical point is related to the high heterogeneity existing among the available scientific studies that makes urgent the need to standardize the experimental procedures. Finally, the in vitro research does not allow to consider all the chemical, organic, and physical factors, as heat or microbiome influence, responsible for the clinical efficacy of BT. A possible solution to overcome some of these criticisms could be to investigate different treatment groups: (1) negative control, (2) positive control, (3) group of treatment with thermal water as a whole, (4) group of treatment with inorganic ingredients, and (5) group of treatment with organic extract from the original water (Varga 2016).",
