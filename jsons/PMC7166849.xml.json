Marra1 and his coworkers discovered the genome sequence of the SARS\u2010associated coronavirus, which lit a lamp for the perplexed investigators. Based on Marra's work, Anand et al.2 built a main proteinase structure using the homology modeling approach. Jenwitheesuk3 indicated that existing HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors have high binding affinity to the SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) proteinase. His findings may help scientists to design SARS inhibitors. De Groot4 also believed that there were some similarities between SARS\u2010CoV and HIV. Xiong et al. found 73 available protease inhibitors from the MDDR database (MDL Drug Data Report, http://www.mdl.com/) by virtual screening.5 Lee et al.6 identified four potent compounds taken from 16 antiviral drugs in the NCI database [National Cancer Institute (NCI) Database (http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/ncidb2/)]. In a recent report, Sirois et al. screened 3.6 million compounds through virtual screening using the MOE software package.7 Wu et al.8 also contributed their excellent work by a cell\u2010based assay, and 15 compounds with potent anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV activity were found, including two existing drugs.",

With larger LogP value, the drug will be difficult to dissolve in water, which is a necessary condition for drugs to be absorbed by an organism. Xu has extended that rule by definition of a drug\u2010like cluster center.18 The criteria we adopted here (see Table 1) for the filter of the two databases combined the ROF with Xu's regulations. Due to SARS\u2010CoV protease's larger active pocket, we expanded the MW to less than 900. Compounds with all their parameters meeting the drug\u2010like rules were picked out and written into a single molecules file. Then the databases were quickly narrowed to 3861 (MNPD) and 5454 (TCMD), respectively. LogP was calculated by the XLogP program.19\n",

M; Shi, L; Lai, L. H. Considering Molecule Weight in Virtual Docking Screening: Implication for Inhibitors Selection). He found that most molecules with heavy atom number (HA) between 5 and 15 interact with the target protein in a proper binding mode. Those compounds usually represent the correct interacting mode of the whole data sets, whereas the energy scores of the molecules with a larger HA spread out partly because of more choices to escape from the \u201cbinding site\u201d or pocket capacity limitation.
