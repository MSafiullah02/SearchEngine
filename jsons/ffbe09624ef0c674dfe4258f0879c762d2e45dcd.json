            "text": "natively, the scope of an NCD tends to be relatively narrow in that specific diagnostic/therapeutic modalities are thoroughly evaluated through an evaluation of all available peer-reviewed literature, along with other sources (e.g., national specialty society position statements, practice guidelines). Except under limited circumstances, such as the November 2001 rule regarding laboratory NCDs, 3 the NCD process defers the actual formulation of code pairings to local contractors.Third, there is a mandated review 4 of all proposed LCDs by contractor-based Carrier Advisory Committees (CACs). In contrast, at the national level, there is an elective referral of pending requests for either contract technology assessments, via CMS' partnership with the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) and/or deliberations by the Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee (MCAC). Thus, such referrals depend on the need for CMS to obtain additional analytical support on specific issues that is above and beyond what can be feasibly generated via internal systematic literature reviews. Whereas the local CAC is constructed mainly to accumulate provider input of varying types, the MCAC is responsible for technical perspectives on the state of the medical evidence, along with consumer and other advocacy viewpoints. Finally, publication formats differ for the LCDs and NCDs. For an LCD, draft policies are posted on contractor Web sites for 90-day review, during which time both general (public) comments are obtained, in tandem with those from CAC representatives. Following this notice-and-comment period, draft LCDs are finalized and then implemented in accordance with local systems specifications, although the term finalization is a misnomer because policy updates and revisions can occur at any time providing that stakeholders give sufficient justification for coverage expansion. Referrals through the CAC/ comment process are required only under the scenario of possible restricted coverage. In addition, under recent legislative mandates, 5,6 the new LCD format requires the publication of companion documentation, including coding guidelines, which must be separate from the expression of medical necessity language in the LCD itself. Both LCD reconsiderations 7 and appeals 8 may be exercised as additional pathways for policy alteration. During the evaluation period, new NCDs are posted on the CMS Web site via a tracking sheet, and the subsequently published draft Decision Memoranda are subject to a 30-day public comment period. This differs somewhat from the draft LCD counterpart, which is posted at the conclusion of its initial deliberative period. Sixty days after the conclusion of this comment period, a final Decision Memorandum is posted, and implementation instructions are concurrently available. As noted above, certain implementation steps, such as matching payable CPT codes with ICD-9-CM codes are usually reserved for development by local contractors, pursuant to the receipt of such instructions. Any subsequent national policy alterations must occur via a separate formal request for reconsideration 9 or an appeal. 10",

For example, interjurisdictional contractors such as TrailBlazer have had to consolidate all prior state-specific LCDs into single documents, which now cover all its jurisdictions. To illustrate, during calendar year 2004, TrailBlazer emphasized such consolidation of existing policies, in lieu of new local policy development. As new multistate Medicare Administrative Contractors 14 are created under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, this type of policy consolidation will likely become much more visible. Also, data-driven considerations, such as claims volumes, are key determinants of this selection process. Perhaps most importantly, the process of selecting such LCDs, in tandem with subsequently drafting new policies or redrafting existing policies, reflects the underlying dynamic in local policy formulation, as well as the interplay of regulatory, collaborative and evaluative forces.",

Thus, if and when contractors use practice guidelines in their coverage deliberations, it might be considered collaborative to the extent that it expresses partnering with the clinical community and evaluative in that many guidelines are crafted according to the principles of EBM.",

In this case, the resultant regulation 18 was sufficiently complex that an LCD 19 was necessary to properly execute the legislation and ensure that appropriate limited coverage was established. Notably, only limited public commentary could be incorporated by the medical policy team, given the instrinsically prescriptive nature of the benefit. For example, during the 2004 statewide consolidation process, multiple clinicians from the different TrailBlazer CACs suggested various clinical indications for which osteoporosis screening would be necessary; however, only ICD-9-CM codes pertaining to the following five qualifying patient categories were permissible: estrogen deficiency, vertebral abnormalities attributable by X-ray to low bone mass, glucocorticoid therapy for at least 3 months, primary hyperparathyroidism, and monitoring for osteoporosis drug therapy. In addition to emphasizing such limitations at each CAC itself, the existing process of including medical policy team responses to all draft LCD recommendations on the published LCD establishes a consistent means for ensuring the transparency of the policy-development process. To respect and maintain the critically important covenant between a contractor and its various stakeholders, commentors are fully entitled to understand decisions regarding whether their suggestions were incorporated into the published LCD.",

In addition to reviewing pertinent practice guidelines, when available, and performing some relevant diagnostic tests (i.e., sensitivity and specificity), the contractor placed considerable focus on consultations with expert members of the laboratory community, most notably the Association for Molecular Pathology and the American Society for Microbiology. Furthermore, this partnership enabled the development of a working list of applicable ICD-9-CM codes-corresponding to those clinical presentations associated with current CPT-specified micro-organisms and those not yet listed (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) that might require molecular diagnostic testing-and allowed claim submission using not otherwise classified codes.",

When the medical policy team assigned corneal pachymetry a Category I CPT code effective January 2004, it did not implement limited coverage; therefore, no LCD was necessary. As with any new and/or existing physician service, the medical policy team periodically reviews claims data to determine if a future LCD might be warranted. Ultimately, the medical policy team did not consider decision making at the level of specific pachymetry devices. Although there is a common operational principle in the reflection of light or ultrasound from anterior and posterior corneal surfaces, it is not within the regulatory purview of a Medi-care contractor to evaluate safety and effectiveness; instead, its purpose is to assess the clinical utility of the overall service encompassed by CPT code 76514\u00a9.",

With WCE, the patient digests a small (11 \u00d7 26 mm) capsule that contains a capsule, which generates images and data as it passes through the digestive system, while maintaining normal activities. During the 8-h examination, information from the camera is transmitted to a recorder device worn around the waist.
