            "text": "A century of medical innovation has greatly reduced deaths from infectious disease and acute illness and dramatically increased life expectancy. The number of persons aged \u2265 65 years is expected to double in our current 20 year period to an estimated 74 million in the USA in 2030\u2013973 million worldwide \u2013 and the average life span is expected to increase by another 10 years by 2050 (Colby and Ortman, 2014). It remains to be determined whether longevity has a natural limit or can continue to lengthen (Dong et al., 2016, Steenstrup et al., 2017). An extended lifespan, however, is associated with a progressive decline in immune function (immunosenescence) resulting in increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections and decreased response to vaccines with age (Carr et al., 2016, Shaw et al., 2013). Our new challenge will be to address such susceptibility and the growing burden of chronic and degenerative illness in aging \u2013 such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease \u2013 and their attendant consequences to individuals and for public health and health-care costs.",

            "text": "The study of aging and longevity were launched more than a century ago by \u00c9lie Metchnikoff, who coined the word \u201cgerontology\u201d, although he is better known for the discovery of phagocytes and cell-mediated immunity for which he and Paul Erlich shared the Nobel prize in 1908 (Gordon, 2008). The complexity of distinct components that contribute to reduced health in aging necessitate a multifaceted approach to the investigation of immune deficiencies and the identification of targets for intervention. Recent advances in high-throughput and bioinformatics technology have allowed for increasingly detailed analyses of complex immunological interactions, facilitating the generation of a \u201csystems-level\u201d understanding of disease susceptibility (Furman and Davis, 2015, Peters et al., 2015, Whiting et al., 2015). Observed reduced responsiveness to immune stimulation in older individuals is associated with a paradoxical state of low-grade, chronic inflammation termed \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019 (Franceschi et al., 2000, Shaw et al., 2013). Particularly compelling are recent studies suggesting that chronic inflammation plays a critical role in susceptibility to infection and reduced responses to vaccination (Espeland et al., 2017, Hodes et al., 2016). There are promising findings regarding the benefits of metabolic interventions such as caloric restriction, metformin, and other anti-inflammatory regimens that highlight the central role of inflammation to longevity (Arai et al., 2015, Goldberg et al., 2015, Lanna et al., 2017, Mannick et al., 2014, Youm et al., 2015).",

As viral clearance depends upon detection, systematic investigations of age-related changes in antiviral recognition and downstream signaling pathways are critical to our understanding of innate immune responses and potential therapeutic opportunities in aging. Notably, while specific cellular responses to viral recognition may differ in basal and induced levels, the overall result in aging leads to a reduced dynamic range of immune responses (Fig. 2\n).",

While the number of circulating PMN is maintained in older donors, many functions are markedly impaired such as recruitment, phagocytosis, release of cytokines and granules, and microbial activity (Tseng and Liu, 2014, Wessels et al., 2010). Older individuals exhibit a distinct hematopoietic stem cell population that is skewed towards myeloid cell differentiation (Pang and Iwasaki, 2011) which may contribute to altered viral susceptibility. They have preserved overall monocyte numbers but increased frequencies of non-classical (CD16 +) monocytes relative to younger individuals (Hearps et al., 2012). In addition, pDCs, specialized sensory DCs primarily involved in viral sensing and antiviral interferon (IFN) production, are decreased in frequency in older adults whereas other DC populations are preserved with age (Jing et al., 2009).",

Lower expression of TLRs leads to corresponding decreases in signaling and responses following the triggering of these pathways. Thus, PMN of older donors, which have reduced expression of TLR1, show reduced stimulation-induced upregulation of integrin activation markers CD11b and CD18, reduced production of the chemokine IL-8, and reduced rescue from apoptosis compared to younger donors (Qian et al., 2014). In monocytes, reduced production of cytokines after stimulation with TLR1/2 ligands in cells from older subjects is correlated with reduced responses to influenza vaccination (van Duin et al., 2007). Similar cytokine defects in cytokine production have been noted in murine macrophages in response to TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation (Boehmer et al., 2004, Boehmer et al., 2005). A notable exception is TLR5, which is increased on monocytes of older subjects, and as the sole TLR with a protein ligand (flagellin), may offer an opportunity for improved vaccine development for older patients (Qian et al., 2012, Taylor et al., 2011). Both classes of dendritic cells (mDC and pDC) from older donors show lower expression of TLRs globally and substantial decreases in cytokine production following TLR stimulation (Jing et al., 2009, Panda et al., 2010).",

However, there is a paradoxical increase in basal activation of many components of the innate immune system with increased basal inflammatory cytokine production (Hearps et al., 2012) and a confounding decrease in inducible levels of cytokines on stimulation. Indeed, accompanying the impaired inducible TLR-mediated responses in cells from older individuals, the cells exhibit increased basal NF-\u03baB nuclear localization and activation with age (Qian et al., 2012). Similarly, in the absence of infection kidneys of elderly rats exhibit a TLR7-dependent basal inflammatory pathway activated by endogenous small RNA ligands (Lee et al., 2017). These basal inflammatory responses with age result in a compressed dynamic range of proinflammatory cytokine responses to stimulation, an observation present across a range of age-related responses (Fig. 2A).",

Interestingly, these same monocytes retain the ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation, suggesting that aging may lead to cell-intrinsic dysregulation specifically in the IFN arm of this response (Pillai et al., 2016). This is consistent with the studies of human PBMCs in which older PBMCs exhibit impaired IFN responses to 5\u2032-ppp RNA transfection relative to younger controls 6 h after stimulation; although in this complex cell population responses were comparable after 24 h (Metcalf et al., 2015). As there is no evidence of altered basal IFN expression with age, impaired IFN induction is representative of a model of age-related reduced dynamic range distinct from that of TLR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine induction (Fig. 2B).",

Aging-linked impairment of inducible NLRP3 inflammasome activation is not as well-documented in human cells, in which IL-1\u03b2 responses to NOD2 stimulation and influenza infection are preserved in older human monocytes and PBMCs (Pillai et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016). In older human donors with hypertension, baseline NLRC4 and NLRC5 expression and inflammasome activation in the peripheral blood was increased, likely stemming from elevated nucleotide-derived metabolites in these donors and potentially contributing to the age-associated inflammation and hypertension (Furman et al., 2017). Indeed, while more work is needed to fully clarify cell-specific differences in the regulation of individual inflammasomes in aging, their baseline activation by endogenous ligands in older individuals occurs in both humans and mice and is an important facet of the inflamm-aging phenotype. Thus, the model of compressed dynamic range of responses is likely active for inflammasome responses as well (Fig. 2A).",

Human monocytes from older donors exhibit both reduced AIM2 expression and impaired caspase-1 activation upon poly(dA:dT) stimulation of AIM2, ultimately leading to decreased IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Wang et al., 2016). A recent study has found that a family of dsDNA binding AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are dispensable for IFN production downstream of cytosolic DNA sensing and that cGAS is the key sensor for this response (Gray et al., 2016). While it is not fully understood how aging alters cytosolic DNA sensing, a large overlap in signaling machinery between the DNA and RNA signaling pathways suggests the likelihood of similar cytokine production defects in both systems. This reduced dynamic range of inducible responses, which is observed in multiple contexts, is a striking feature of the aging innate immune response and has important consequences for response to infectious challenge.",

Age-related changes in innate immunity to many viruses remain to be fully explored, with a limited number of studies available to draw upon at present. However, pDCs from healthy older subjects secreted less IFN in response to IAV and to WNV (Jing et al., 2009, Qian et al., 2011). Notably, the age-related reductions in expression and inducible activation of TLR, RLR, and inflammasome recognition pathways as noted above will likely contribute to similar defects in viral infections, potentially resulting in impaired viral control and age-linked increases in susceptibility to IAV, WNV, and other viruses.",

This impairment via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated pathway may be relevant for elevated cytokine production contributing to permeability of the blood-brain barrier and increased severity of WNV infection in older individuals (Hoffman et al., 2016, Kong et al., 2008). In DCs from older donors infected with WNV in vitro, reduced levels of pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 7 were detected, with lower production of cytokines in response to infection with WNV (Qian et al., 2011). In particular, production of type I IFN was significantly lower in DCs from older donors compared to younger donors and diminished induction of late phase signaling responses, e.g. STAT1, IRF7, and IRF1, suggesting defective regulation of type I IFN induction (Qian et al., 2011). Murine models have identified critical roles for cytosolic receptors in control of WNV (Lazear and Diamond, 2015). Notably, the expression of TLR7 in older mice is lower upon WNV infection as compared to younger mice (Xie et al., 2015).",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection of aged mice is associated with delayed viral clearance, increased tissue damage, and impaired ISG upregulation consistent with impaired IFN responses (Boukhvalova et al., 2007, Wong et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2011).

While IFNs are necessary for effective antiviral responses, aberrant IFN signaling in vitro and in murine models has been linked to accelerated cellular senescence and stem cell decline (Gough et al., 2012, Sato et al., 2009, Yu et al., 2015). Both the DNA damage response and mitochondrial dysfunction, which increase in aging, induce IFN production in a cGAS-dependent manner (H\u00e4rtlova et al., 2015, West et al., 2015, Yu et al., 2015), and have been hypothesized to contribute to aging-associated phenotypes (R\u00fcbe et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2016, Vermeij et al., 2014). Thus, the reduced dynamic range of the IFN response observed in cells from older individuals may be an important adaptation to mitigate the caustic effects of chronic IFN production, favoring prolonged cell renewal at the cost of rapidly inducible antiviral immunity. Further systematic studies identifying the drivers of impaired IFN induction in the cells of older individuals will be critical for the development of a comprehensive understanding of how aging modulates antiviral immunity.",

Pattern recognition receptors cytosolic nucleic acid sensors (RIG-I and cGAS), endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and inflammasomes recognize viral pathogens. Recognition by these receptors activates key signaling intermediates and transcription factors leading to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF\u03b1), antiviral interferons (IFNs), and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that serve key antiviral functions within the cell. Inflammasome activation in response to viral nucleic acids or virulence activity leads to caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into an active form that is then secreted. Basal expression of recognition receptors and both basal and induced signaling responses are altered in aging (red arrows).",

Model A is consistent with many proinflammatory cytokine and inflammasome responses in older individuals. (B) Equal basal activity. Upon stimulation, the magnitude of the inducible response is significantly reduced compared to younger individuals. Model B is consistent with impaired interferon responses observed in older individuals.",
