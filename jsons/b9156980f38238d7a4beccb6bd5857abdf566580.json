It is a well-known fact that in the past 25 years, blood testing and donor selection have had a notable impact on reducing infectious complications [ 4 , 5 ] and today, noninfectious adverse reactions to transfusion (NIART) are prevalent. If we look at the UK's Serious Hazards of Blood Transfusion hemovigilance data for 2012 [ 6 ] , of the 538 cases analyzed only 3 were transfusion-transmitted infections; 372 acute transfusion reactions, 42 hemolytic transfusion reactions, 11 transfusion-related acute lung injuries, and 82 transfusionassociated circulatory overload. Hemovigilance data for our region, Friuli Venezia Giulia (North East Italy), are presented in Table 7 .1 [ 7 ] . The critically ill patient can be affected by both infectious and noninfectious adverse reactions after a transfusion therapy and the importance of diagnosis is remarkable for the severity of clinical conditions usually treated in an intensive care unit.

Like the primitive CJD, it results from the changing of a prion protein into a proteaseresistant form (PrP Sc). Originally, bovine spongiform encephalopathy affected cattle. The use of animal protein in bovine feed diffused the disease in cows.

Figure 7 .1 depicts the main critical points for a safe transfusion. Transfusion requests originate in the ward and clinicians first of all should ask themselves whether their patient does in fact need the transfusion. This means that clinicians should rely on guidelines for which there is a wide consensus on the appropriate use of blood. An important role in this regard is played by the Hospital Transfusion Committee, which is the ideal forum in which these documents are prepared and shared by the hospital medical staff. Clinicians should always bear in mind that the safest transfusion is the one which is not performed. A written request form must be made specifying correct patient data (name, surname, place, and date of birth), condition requiring transfusion, ward, type and number of blood components required, urgency of transfusion, blood group and red blood cell antibody status if previously determined, history of sensitization episodes, previous NIARTs, signature of medical doctor. Fulfilling the request form correctly is the first step toward a safe transfusion. The second step relates to withdrawing blood samples; patient must be identified at the bedside; when possible the patient should be asked his/her name and surname and date of birth, otherwise the patient record must be used. Here again it must be pointed out that many transfusion errors are made at this truly critical point. Traceability (an important ingredient of safety) is enhanced by bar codes on the request form and sample labels. Moreover, as far as AB0 and Rh testing is concerned, it should be performed previous to the request form on a separate blood sample. This is to reduce the risk of mistakes due to swapping of patients. The nurse or medical doctor who withdraws blood should sign the label on blood sample tube to testify that patient identity has been checked.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 156, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Organizational Measures for the Management of NIARTs"}, {"text": "The request form and sample is then sent to the transfusion center; the date and time of arrival must be registered and the coherence of data reported on the request form and on the sample label checked.

The transfusion center should have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in place specifying what type of compatibility testing is performed for which type of patient (e.g., type and screen for nonimmunized recipients, cross-matching for immunized patients). The SOP should also specify what tests should be performed in case of very urgent cases. Once the request form is registered, pretransfusion testing can be performed. If we consider safety at 360\u00b0 as it ought to be, we must also mention that quality of testing plays a major role in transfusion safety. This means that a quality management system should be in place in the immunohematology laboratory foreseeing SOPs for all activities (testing, blood component preparation, and storage), internal quality control on reagents and blood components (including sterility), external proficiency testing (for blood groups, antibody screening, and identification), maintenance program for instruments, a training program for the staff, and a quality improvement scheme.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Organizational Measures for the Management of NIARTs"}, {"text": "Once testing is completed (an AB0 direct test should be performed on all samples accompanying the request form), compatible units are chosen according to an SOP; this document should also state in which conditions nonideally compatible units can be issued (e.g., group 0 Rh positive red blood cell units for 0 Rh negative recipients). The issuing of blood components should be registered on the software, which also prints a form that accompanies the units on which patient data number and blood group of unit are reported. This \"transfusion form\" ideally should be divided in two with one section that must be returned to the transfusion center testifying that the patient has been transfused; should adverse reactions be observed, these should be registered on this form. Units are then sent to the ward (in appropriate containers at controlled temperature). Before transfusion, personnel (in Italy a nurse and medical doctor) should check, with the aid of a checklist, the patient's identity (possibly asking name, surname, and date of birth), blood group on patient record, blood unit label, and transfusion form. This check is pivotal for the safety of transfusion since it is the last chance for a transfusion error to be stopped.

One of the difficulties concerns differential diagnosis of NIARTs in that many signs and symptoms are common to more than one reaction; Table 7 .8 reports some signs and symptoms of NIARTs (for a more thorough description see specific references). A second difficulty concerns the fact that fortunately, the majority of NIARTs are rare events and therefore personnel may have little experience in dealing with them. Third, in some cases (patients in intensive care units for example) symptoms may be heavily modified by the patient's clinical condition (hemoglobinuria may be the only sign of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction in patients under anesthesia).
