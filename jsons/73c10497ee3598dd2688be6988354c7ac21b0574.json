            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified to cause acute respiratory disease in humans. An outbreak of this disease has been reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter. The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people. Assuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of the social gathering should have a protection with more than 70 percent effectiveness.",

Human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV has been established, such as through respiratory droplets (Chan et al. 2020) , and there is also a suspicion of asymptomatic infection (Chan et al. 2020 , Kupferschmidt 2020 .

            "text": "A comparison of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV with other viruses can be found in the paper by Chen (2020) . Based on clinical studies, 2019-nCoV is less pathogenic than MERS-CoV and SARS, but there is still debate on the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV with estimated \" ranging 1.4-5.5 (SARS is 2-5 and MERS-CoV is <1) (Chen 2020) . The estimated case fatality rate for 2019-nCoV is 3 percent (10% for SARS and 40% for MERS-CoV) (Chen 2020) . Case fatality rate is the number of deaths due to the disease divided by the total number of cases having the disease. It should be noted that case fatality rate is not equal to an infected's chance of death due to the disease (although many use this as approximation). Probability of death or survival is person or situation-dependent. Also, a case fatality rate computed at global or national scale could be different from the case fatality rate computed at local scale. If 2019-nCoV ARD outbreak happens in a community with inferior health system, then case fatality rate in that community may be higher. The case fatality rate currently being computed is still an initial estimate since the epidemics is still ongoing, the number of deaths and total number of cases could still change. Shen et al. (2020) predict epidemic of 2019-nCoV in China totalling to 8,042 infecteds with case fatality rate of 11.02 percent. Their prediction used data prior to 25 January 2020, and is not anymore accurate as of 8 February 2020. As of 08 February 2020, total confirmed cases in mainland China is 34,611, total deaths is 723 and total recovered is 2,370 (Johns Hopkins CSSE 2020). Shen et al. (2020) also estimated a basic reproduction number \" = 4.71 at the start of the epidemic on 12 December 2019 and the effective reproduction number + decreasing to 2.08 as of 22 January 2020. + is the average number of new cases caused by an infected when only a fraction of the population is susceptible. Shen et al. (2020) predict that if effective intervention continues, the epidemics is expected to peak in March 2020. They suggested that every one day reduction in the average duration from disease onset to isolation of infecteds will reduce the peak population size by 72-84 percent, and both the cumulative infected cases and deaths by 68-80 percent. Also, every 10 percent reduction in transmission rate could reduce the peak population size by 20-47 percent, and both the cumulative January 2020 which is way larger than the number of reported cases, and the epidemic doubling time is 6.4 days. They also predict that, if transmissibility in cities in mainland China is similar to Wuhan, then localized outbreaks are being sustained and the epidemics is already growing exponentially with a lag time of 1-2 weeks behind the Wuhan outbreak. Wu et al. (2020) predict that large cities with close transportation links with China may become another epicenter of the epidemics unless effective control strategies are placed. Without reduction in mobility and transmissibility, daily 2019-nCoV ARD incidence will peak in the last week of March and early week of April 2020 with around 35 cases per 1,000 population. Reducing transmissibility by 25 percent will reduce the daily incidence to around 20 cases per 1,000 population and delay the peak of the outbreak to early May 2020. Julien Riou and Christian L. Althaus of the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern predict that \" is around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4-3.8) (Riou and Althaus 2020) . Riou and Althaus (2020) also estimated the median dispersion parameter k = 0.54 that measure the Early models of 2019-nCoV ARD dynamics chance of super-spreading (k is a parameter of the negative-binomial offspring distribution where value near zero denotes overdispersion). They indicated that transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS and to the 1918 pandemic influenza. They suggested heightened screening, surveillance and control at airports and other travel hubs to prevent further global outbreak. Read et al. (2020) Assumption ii. delay from symptom onset to isolation follows an Erlang distribution (rate=2) with mean of 2.9 days;",

Early models of 2019-nCoV ARD dynamics Other models have also considered importation of 2019-nCoV ARD from Wuhan to other countries using transportation data (Gardner 2020 , Chinazzi et al. 2020 .

Major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu are predicted to have large outbreaks. Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea have high risk of disease importation via air travel. The lockdown of Wuhan is estimated to contribute only to 24.9 percent reduction in epidemic size in locations outside Wuhan. Zhou T. et al.

(2020), in addition to the \" estimate, are as follow: a. their model replicated the reported temporal trend of epidemics in Wuhan and other countries as of 30 January 2020; b. if there are >3 cases in a location with similar transmissibility as in Wuhan, then there is >50 percent probability of outbreak in that location; and c. there will be substantial variation in the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV over time, which suggests that effectiveness of control measures is setting-dependent.Due to the uncertainties in the early stages of an epidemic that could lead to pandemic, estimating transmissibility and severity (e.g., by analyzing data of the first few hundred cases) can be achallenging task. Black et al. (2017) proposed a way to do an early estimation. This could help authorities in estimating the impact and level of risks. To reconcile the different \" estimates for the 2019-nCoV ARD epidemics, Park et al. (2020) proposed a framework to compare and integrate the different \" values estimated using different models. Early models of 2019-nCoV ARD dynamics D. Models by De Salazar et al. (2020) and Chinazzi et al. (2020) The team of Pablo M. De Salazar and Rene Niehus from Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health used simple regression analysis to predict imports of 2019-nCoV cases from Wuhan to other countries outside China (De Salazar et al. 2020). The goal of their study is to determine possible countries that are under-detecting the number of imported cases. The assumptions of their model are: Assumption i. only direct air travel volume from Wuhan to other countries are considered; and Assumption ii. the observed case counts follow a Poisson distribution. This means thatDeSalazar et al. (2020) assumes that the case counts are random and have equal mean and variance.DeSalazar et al. (2020) used generalized linear regression, which may only detect linear but not the nonlinear relationship in the data. The regression model with coefficient is as follows: : is the observed case count in the i-th country which is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with estimated mean : . The variable : is the number of daily flight passengers from Wuhan to the i-th country. Inferring from the results of DeSalazar et al. (2020), the maximum likelihood estimate of is 0.07 with bounds 0.04-0.13 (95% prediction interval). Based on the model by DeSalazar et al.
