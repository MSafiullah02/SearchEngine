The symptoms caused by Sars-CoV-2 infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome (\u223c29%), acute cardiac injury (\u223c12%) or acute kidney injury (\u223c7%) [2], implying that Sars-CoV-2 may infect various human tissues. COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease [3,4] associated with high mortality [5]. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is a betacoronavirus [6]. The previous name for this virus was Sars-CoV-2. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced [7,8]. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has 96% similarity to the bat-coronavirus and 76.5% identity to the SARS-CoV [9]. Although there are no approved drugs or vaccines for COVID-19, some clinical trials are in progress [10]. Lopinavir and Ritonavir were used in preliminary clinical studies [3].",

However, experimental data of the same scale for Sars-CoV-2 may take years to obtain by the research community. By leveraging the previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structure and function, bioinformaticians have been successfully helping the virologists by structurally characterizing proteins of novel viruses, determining the evolutionary trajectories, identifying interactions with host proteins, and providing other important biological insights. In particular, a plethora of results have been achieved through comparative, or homology, modeling principles [19,20]. In addition to the global structural genomics initiatives focusing on determining the 3D structures of proteins on a genome-scale [21] and specific efforts on rapid structural characterization of proteins in emerging viruses [22,23], multiple works have used comparative modeling to predict the structures of protein-protein interaction complexes [[24], [25], [26]], facilitating structure-based drug discovery [20,27,28], inferring protein functions [29], determining the macromolecular interaction network [[30], [31], [32]], and providing molecular insights into viral evolution [[33], [34], [35]].",

The first two-thirds of viral 30 kb RNA genome, mainly named as ORF1a/b region, translates into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and encodes most of the non-structural proteins (nsp) [37]. The rest parts of the virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein [37,38] Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus (CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases [39,40]. Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with different host-cell receptor binding patterns [39], as well as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus [41], there are several limitations on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches. Antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1\n).",

It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins during packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication, transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism [42,43]. The primary functions of N protein are binding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex [44,45]. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that N protein bound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitable for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome [43,45,46]. More studies implicated that N protein regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis [47,48]. The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [[49], [50], [51]]. The common domain architectures of coronavirus N protein are consisting of three distinct but highly conserved parts: An N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and intrinsically disordered central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies have revealed that the NTD are responsible for RNA binding, CTD for oligomerization, and (SR)-rich linker for primary phosphorylation, respectively [[52], [53], [54]]. The crystal structures of SARS-CoV N-NTD [55], infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N-NTD [56,57], HCoV-OC43 N-NTD [53] and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N-NTD [58] have been solved. The CoVs N-NTD have been found to associate with the 3\u2032 end of the viral RNA genome, possibly through electrostatic interactions. Additionally, several critical residues have been identified for RNA binding and virus infectivity in the N-terminal domain of coronavirus N proteins [[58], [59], [60]]. However, the structural and mechanistic basis for newly emerged novel SARS-CoV-2 N protein remains largely unknown. Understanding these aspects should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the coronavirus replication, transcription and viral assembly [61]. Kang et al. [62] reported the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. This finding will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV [62].",

            "text": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by Sars-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Viruses bind to host receptors on the target cell surface to establish infection. Membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses [63]. As recently reported, both nCoV and SARS-CoV could use ACE2 protein to gain entry into the cells [64]. Since the outbreak, many data analysis have shown a wide distribution of ACE2 across human tissues, including lung [65], liver [66], stomach [67], ileum [67], colon [67] and kidney [68], indicating that Sars-CoV-2 may infect multiple organs. However, these data showed that AT2 cells (the main target cell of Sars-CoV-2) in the lung expressed rather low levels of ACE2 [68]. Hence, the nCoVs may depend on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [69]. For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that Sars-CoV-2-S use ACE2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming [70], showing that 2019- nCoV infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptors\u2019 usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for Sars-CoV-2 is of great significance.",

To identify the potential candidates [73], explored the single-cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single-cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports [73], confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly [73], found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.",

It is well recognized that ssRNA viruses tend to have multiple receptors [69]. For example, ACE2, CD209 (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing Non-Integrin 1), CLEC4G (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G) and CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4 member M) are receptors of SARS-CoV [71,74]. Also, other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry [63]. Since the viral receptors and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types, single-cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors was analyzed [64]. After calculating gene expression similarity, they found ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are the top three genes correlated with ACE4 (R > 0.8). Interestingly, both ANPEP and DPP4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses [75], while ENPEP is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear. For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [76]. In addition, Li et al. [77] showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that different human CoVs target similar cell types across different human tissues.",

Blocking the binding of S protein to ACE2 is important for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection [102]. One recombinant human monoclonal antibody (mAb) (single-chain variable region fragments, scFvs 80R) against the S1 domain of S protein of SARS-CoV from two nonimmune human antibody libraries.

Lopinavir (LPV) is usually combined with ritonavir (RTV) to increase and Polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent [105]. Emodin could significantly block the interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV and ACE2 [106]. Promazine, an anti-psychotic drug, shares a similar structure with emodin. It has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV [107]. As compared to emodin, promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of S protein to ACE2. These findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit SARS-CoV infectivity by blocking the interaction of S protein and ACE2. Therefore, the monoclonal antibody (scFv80R), chloroquine, emodin, and promazine could be used as choices for the treatment of COVID-19. Nicotianamine is an important metal-ligand in plants [108] and it is found a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 inhibitor in soybean [109]. So, it is another potential option to be used to reduce the infection of COVID-19.",

Given adverse reactions and the lack of in vitro efficacy, the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of COVID-19, even in combination with other antiviral drugs. The combination of lopinavir (LPV) with ritonavir (RTV) is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of HIV infection [112]. Kim et al.

Remdesivir (RDV), a nucleoside analog GS-5734, had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vivo [114]. Recently, the antiviral activity of RDV and IFN-\u03b2 was found to be superior to that of LPV/RTV\u2013IFN\u2013\u03b2 against MERS-CoV in vitro and in vivo [115]. Therefore, the use of RDV with IFN-\u03b2 could be a better choice for the treatment of COVID-19 comparing with that of the triple combination of LPV/RTV\u2013IFN\u2013\u03b2.

Development of novel drugs is a time-consuming process and generally, several years of work are required for clinical approval [121]. Drug repositioning, also known as repurposing, is an effective strategy to combat novel diseases caused by infectious agents that spread rapidly [123]. Drugs that have been approved for some disease, are safe for human use, and only their effectiveness against the disease of interest needs to be established [124]. In life-threatening cases, where there is no alternative medicine or vaccine, such a drug repurposing strategy is particularly attractive.

In several early studies, the similarities in the sequence of a potential target for COVID-19 to that of the SARS Mpro were utilized to build a model for the structure of SARS- CoV-2 Mpro [126]. Homology based models were utilized to screen a library of compounds to predict that Nelfinavir, an approved antiviral protease inhibitor, is a potential drug for COVID-19 [122]. The sequence similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to the SARS Mpro is sufficiently high to build a good model for the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [123,127].

During the epidemic and pandemic outbreak of new viral pathogens, the conventional method of development of drugs and vaccination is not possible to control as it is a time-consuming process [128,129]. Consequently, the rapid approach based on in-silico informatics has become very popular with recent advances in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases [[130], [131], [132]]. The continuous increase of patients and a high mortality rate of Sars-CoV-2 infection highlight the urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine [133]. The aim of this is to use to computational approach to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. The spike protein in the novel coronavirus sequence is used to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. For anti-viral drug design, receptor-binding protein of novel coronavirus present in the N-terminal of spike protein is homology modeled and used as a protein receptor [134]. 3C like proteinase (3CLpro) plays a role in viral pathogenicity and replication by clevaging the polyprotein. The inhibitors of 3CLpro can block the clevage reaction thereby controlling viral replication and pathogenicity [135]. The natural inhibitors were used as ligands and docked with homology modelled coronavirus receptor binding protein [136]. For vaccine design, the full sequence of the spike protein of novel coronavirus is used to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes. The select best T-cell epitopes based on antigenicity used as peptides and docked with human allele protein.",

The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane [141,142]. The S protein includes the receptor binding S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) is specifically recognized by the host receptor. When the S1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is destabilized, resulting in the shedding of the S1 subunit, and the state transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation [143].

In addition, the proteome-wide MR analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ACE2 expression.
