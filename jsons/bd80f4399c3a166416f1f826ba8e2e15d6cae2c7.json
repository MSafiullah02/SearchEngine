For Aroclors 1242, 1254, and 1260, the chlorination reaction was stopped when the weight percent chlorine of the product had reached 42, 54, or 60%, respectively. By contrast, Aroclor 1016 was prepared by the fractional distillation of Aroclor 1242, which excluded the higher boiling (i.e., more highly chlorinated) congeners. Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, and 1260 were the most widely used PCBs in the United States, and accounted for 92% of all 1958-1977 production (Monsanto, 1980) . Polychlorinated biphenyls were versatile materials which found use in a variety of applications including plasticizers, printing inks, and heat exchange, dielectric, and hydraulic fluids. The dielectric properties, chemical stability, and noncombustibility of PCB fluids made them a particularly attractive alternative to flammable mineral oils for use in capacitors and indoor transformers.",

In studies where PCB mixtures of differing chlorine content have been evaluated (Ito et al., 1973; Nagasaki et al., 1972; Schaeffer et al., 1984) , the data suggest that tumorigenic potential decreases with decreasing chlorination; nevertheless, the EPA chose to regulate all PCBs as equivalent to highly chlorinated mixtures, with a cancer potency factor of 7.7 (mg/kg-day)\" 1 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1988). In 1993, the General Electric Co. initiated a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats which conformed to EPA testing (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) and Good Laboratory Practice (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) guidelines. The purpose of this study was to allow direct comparisons of the most widely used Aroclors (1016, 1242, 1254, and 1260 ) in a design that would facilitate evaluation for dose response, chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and toxicokinetics. The current paper reports the findings associated with the carcinogenicity (24-month exposure) segment of this study. weeks old, and weighing 248-252 g (males) and 198-203 g (females), respectively, at study initiation, were assigned to 11 treatment groups (50 rats/sex/dose group) and one control group (100 rats/sex) in a manner that minimized group mean body weight differences. These groups were augmented by additional animals for evaluations of chronic toxicity and neurotoxicity and the progression and reversibility of pathology, the results of which will be reported separately. Prior to study initiation, animals were certified free of Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, coronavirus/sialodacryoadentis, Kilham rat virus, Toolan's H-l virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis by collecting serum from 5 rats/sex for evaluation (Microbiological Associates, Inc., Rockville, MD). All animals were acclimated to, and maintained in, a controlled environment of 68-80\u00b0F, 40-70% relative humidity and 12-h light/dark cycles. Animals were identified by tail tattoos and individually housed in stainless-steel wire mesh cages. Twice each day animals were evaluated for clinical signs and mortality. Once per month for the first 6 months, and weekly thereafter. animals were examined in detail by palpation for tissue masses or other abnormalities. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted on all animals prior to study initiation and on all surviving control and high-dose group animals from each Aroclor at 24 months. All groups assigned to a single Aroclor mixture were segregated in compound-specific animal treatment rooms. The controls were housed sepa-rately. To minimize the potential for cross-contamination, technical staff members either were restricted to working with a single Aroclor mixture or were required to shower and regarment before entering a different Aroclor animal treatment room. Animal housing and care conformed with the guidelines established by the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 86-23. (Table 1) . PCDD concentrations were 0.6, 0, 20, and 0 ppb for Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, and 1260, respectively PCDF analyses showed total concentrations to be within acceptable ranges for Aroclors 1016, 1242, and 1260 (i.e., 0.035, 2 9, and 4.9 ppm, respectively), but elevated for Aroclor 1254 (23 ppm). Accordingly, Aroclor 1254 was treated for PCDF removal by AccuStandard using the procedure of Preston el al. (1981) . This removed >99% of the PCDFs and also reduced the concentration of congener 126 (3,3',4,4',5-PCB) approximately 35%, but still left the concentration of congener 126 three to five times greater, and consequently the TEQ (toxic equivalency) about two times greater (calculated as per Ahlborg (1994) ), than that of ordinary Aroclor 1254. It was subsequently found that this lot of Aroclor 1254 had been made by a modified procedure that was used only in the final years of manufacture, and accounted for under 1 % of the total Aroclor 1254 production for the years 1958-1977.",

The morphologic appearance of the thyroid tumors were characteristic of those that develop as a secondary response to chronic overstimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This phenomonon is more common in males than female rats due to higher circulating levels of TSH in males (Capen 1996) . Oversecretion of TSH results when hepatic enzyme induction accelerates the metabolism of T3 and T4, with subsequent loss of feedback inhibition within the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (Curran and De-Groot, 1991) . PCBs are very effective hepatic mixed-function oxidase enzyme inducers, and presumably produce thyroid tumors in male rats through hypersecretion of TSH as described above.",

In a study by Kimbrough et al. (1975) , administration of Aroclor 1260 to Sherman rats resulted in a reduced incidence of mammary tumors. The results of the current study are consistent with this finding because the rate of spontaneous mammary tumors in PCB-exposed females was decreased. The decreases were most consistently observed for groups receiving Aroclors 1242 and 1260, although decreases were also observed for some groups receiving Aroclors 1016 and 1254. The decreased tumor rates may be the result of an alteration in the 2-hydroxylation versus 16a-hydroxylation ratio of estrogen (Bradlow et al., 1995; Fishman et al., 1995) , which has been demonstrated for the current study (Amaratunga et al., 1997) . In summary, the results of this study indicate that PCBs have sex-dependent tumor-suppressing and tumor-enhancing activities in Sprague-Dawley rats. Tumor repression occurred in the mammary glands of the females. Tumor enhancement occurred in the thyroid gland of the males and the liver of both sexes, but primarily in the liver of the females. The tumors that were produced were mostly benign and did not curtail the natural life span of the animals. The study also shows that PCBs differ in tumor-inducing potency, and supports the use of PCBspecific cancer slope factors for scientifically based risk assessments.",

The overwhelming majority of the tumors induced were benign hepatocellular adenomas (80%), with smaller numbers of hepatocellular carcinomas (11%), hepatocholangiomas (8%), and hepatocholangiocarcinomas (<1%). These neoplasms did not adversely impact treatment-group survival rates because, for all Aroclor-exposed groups of females, survival was greater for treatment groups than for controls. For females, the tumor incidence differed between Aroclor mixtures in a manner that paralleled the differences between Aroclors in total TEQ (calculated as per Ahlborg (1994) ), i.e., Aroclor 1254 > Aroclor 1260 \u00bb Aroclor 1242 > Aroclor 1016 (Table 1) . A more complete description of the correlation of hepatic TEQ and PCB accumulation with tumor incidence for males and females has been reported by . The composition of Aroclor 1254 used in the current study contained twice the TEQ of the product that was generally used in commercial applications. Therefore, the response for females in this study overrepresents the response that would have been expected for ordinary Aroclor 1254.The liver tumor response rate for females receiving Aroclor 1254 in the current study (38, 56, and 56% for the 25, 50, and 100 ppm dose groups, respectively) was also much greater than that observed in a study conducted by the NCI (1978), wherein liver tumor incidence rates of 4, 8, and 4% were recorded at dietary doses of 25, 50, and 100 ppm, respectively (Moore et al., 1994) . The reason for the disparate tumor response rates is unknown, but a differential sensitivity between the rat strains used in the two studies (Fisher 344 vs Sprague-Dawley) is clearly a possibility. Another difference between the studies may be the composition of Aroclor 1254 used, i.e., lot KB01-604, produced.in 1971 , versus lot KI-02-6024, produced in 1976 and subsequently modified (see Table 1 ).A slight, non-dose-related, increase in the incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas was observed in males receiving Aroclors 1242, 1254, and 1260. The background incidence of this tumor type in male Sprague-",
