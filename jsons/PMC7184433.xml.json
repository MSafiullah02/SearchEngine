These measures have met with varying degrees of success. Especially in the beginning of the epidemic the public\u2019s response to warnings was often weak and ineffective, thus wasting opportunities to effectively contain the spread of the disease. And even when the scale of the problem became pandemic, a significant number of people did (and continue to) not strictly follow the recommendations. This lack of adherence is often condemned as irresponsible and selfish, but that need not necessarily be the case. Changing people\u2019s behaviour is simply not as easy as just informing them of the risks. Years of research in protective health behaviour informed by theoretical models such as the Health Belief Model (Champion and Skinner, 2008) or the Protection Motivation Theory (Prentice-Dunn and Rogers, 1986) have shown that people will only act on health warnings if they:\nbelieve that they are personally susceptible to develop the condition against which protection is required;perceive the condition as severe;perceive the preventive action as effective to reduce the threat; andbelieve they are capable to perform the preventive action.",

Research on health literacy has shown that more than a third of the population worldwide has difficulties in finding, understanding, evaluating and using information that is necessary to manage their health (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2015; Duong et al., 2017). Authorities should take that into account when informing the public about COVID-19 and adapt the information to the literacy needs of the people they want to reach. That means the response to the pandemic should be looked at through an equity lens (Smith and Judd, 2020), with attention for those who are the most vulnerable in pandemics, such as elderly, migrants or people with disabilities. Okan et al. (2020) give the following recommendations to take health literacy into account when communicating about the CoV-2:\nprovide information in an understandable way, recognizing that people and groups with low health literacy may need more explanation and different communication formats such as animations that explain the virus, the disease, its transmission and protective measures;explain the situation transparently and clarify the overriding objectives repeatedly, to prepare people for the fact that interventions and recommendations might change when new evidence arrives and scenarios must be adapted;communicate new evidence and information without being afraid to correct earlier messages and statements if necessary; andavoid blaming, but instead strengthen the well-informed responsibility of the individual while showing solidarity with vulnerable population groups.",

To inform themselves about the virus and ways to protect themselves, people actively select information sources and information from within these sources, some of which may be contradictory. Information processing theory teaches us that this selection is influenced by context, emotions and selective attention (Estes, 2014), thus introducing a potential selection bias whereby more attention is paid to some information than to other. The use of cognitive schemes to process this information adds another form of bias, namely confirmation bias (i.e. the tendency to seek information that confirms the beliefs already held and to ignore or discard information that contradicts these beliefs). Likewise, the activation of cognitive schemes to filter, classify and assimilate information and make connections with already available knowledge that takes place when trying to understand and appraise the information about the virus and to judge the importance of preventive measures can again cause a series of biases. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the most important ones are possibly negative information bias (i.e. the tendency to attach more importance to negative than to positive information, resulting in \u00ab catastrophic thinking \u00bb), positive information bias (i.e. the tendency to consider oneself as less at risk for negative consequence, causing \u00ab unrealistic optimism \u00bb), and familiarity or recency bias (i.e. things that are familiar or recent are more easily retrieved from memory and therefore more easily considered as \u00ab true \u00bb).",

Communication and interaction can to some extent be replaced by digital means in the form of online meetings, e-learning platforms or distance learning tools, but these tools do not provide the same depth of interaction as face-to-face meetings and require sufficient digital skills and organizational support. Furthermore, they do not allow the same level of \u2018informal\u2019 contact that make human interactions meaningful, and are difficult to implement at a level that goes beyond the organization and involves the larger community. Yet while the switch to different modes of operating creates a lot of insecurity and stress, many communities react by showing high levels of solidarity and mutual support.

In its effort to move away from a strongly disease-oriented approach to public health, health promotion has traditionally focused on non-communicable disease, where it has significantly contributed to the progress made in areas like tobacco and obesity prevention. But with the exception of HIV/AIDS, the application of health promotion principles and methods to tackle infectious diseases has been largely neglected. As a result, public health professionals who deal with communicable diseases are often unaware of the approaches used by health promoters (ECDC, 2014), although there is a good reason to assume that these can be usefully adapted and applied to preventing infectious diseases as well. That would require, however, that health promotion researchers and practitioners develop a keen interest in infectious diseases. McQueen (2015) argues that to further the cause of health promotion applied to both infectious and non-communicable disease, health promotion needs to focus more on intervention research and understand the processes involved in implementation, rather than on outcomes and causality. As interventions are dynamic and subject to change during implementation, participatory methods should be further developed, recognized and documented in the scientific literature and in research protocols.",

There is a general consensus that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is of animal origin, jumped species boundaries to infect humans either before or after it evolved to its current pathogenic state (Andersen et al., 2020), and could then very rapidly spread in a globalized economic system characterized by high levels of interconnectedness and mobility. Health promotion has never paid much attention to zoonotic causes of human health, but the current crisis suggests that maybe it should. A good starting point would be to embrace the concept of \u2018One Health\u2019, which recognizes the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment, with the goal to achieve optimal health outcomes (Atlas et al., 2010; Calistri et al., 2013). After all, the collaborative, multisectoral and transdisciplinary nature of the One Health approach is very much akin to health promotion\u2019s principles and strategies. It also links very well with the growing interest of health promotion researchers and practitioners for sustainable development, as exemplified by recent projects (e.g. INHERIT; https://www.inherit.eu) and by the choice of \u2018planetary health and sustainable development\u2019 as the theme for the latest IUHPE World Conference on Health Promotion (Ratima, 2019).",

To deal with an epidemic effectively, we must not only understand viruses and how they spread, but also the ways in which people make decisions, organizations operate and communities relate in reaction to them (Kickbusch and Sakellarides, 2006). Health promotion researchers should learn from crisis situations, analyse the reactions and document the learnings. A good example is the way the Singaporean government dealt with the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was shown that, rather than the actual knowledge about the virus, the high confidence and trust in the government\u2019s ability to cope with SARS was a key factor in controlling the crisis (Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2005). This confirms findings from other studies highlighting the importance of trust in dealing with crisis situations (Siegrist and Zingg, 2014). In a similar vein, a comparison between the response to Hurricane Katarina in New Orleans and to SARS in Toronto put the success of the Toronto response down to social cohesion (Matthews, 2006, cited by Kickbusch and Sakellarides, 2006). These and other findings call for further research on the ways trust in public institutions can be enhanced and social capital can be mobilized in order to make populations more resilient against crises.",

We have to accept uncertainty and learn to live with it. The only certainty we have is that the world will be different after COVID-19. As a consequence, this crisis can also be a turning point for health promotion. Confucius, in all his wisdom, believed that it is the study of the past that helps to define the future. But in the current situation, it may well be the present that gives us directions in which to look forward.",
