Initially, research focused on nanocarrier biocompatibility and toxicity, whereas second-generation nanomaterials aimed to have an optimized surface, to provide more stability, stealth, and targeting capabilities. The most recent models support the \u2018smart nanomedicine\u2019 idea, improving targeting mechanisms and theranostic abilities [1]. This nanotechnological advance is important because it enables drugs to cross physiological barriers to reach their target sites safely and sustainably [2]. In fact, nanomaterials provide a stable biocompatible environment to encapsulate drugs, promoting their controlled release and efficient absorption 3, 4. They also improve the duration of the therapeutic effects and minimize adverse effects by driving drugs toward the site of action and increasing the concentration of a drug in the area of pathology in a specific way 5, 6. Depending on the accumulation of the delivery system in the tissue, cell, or in a specific subcellular compartment of interest, targeting approaches can be primary, secondary, or tertiary, respectively [7].",

The importance of organelle targeting increases when drugs efficiently treat or decreases symptoms of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, infectious and autoimmune diseases [8]. Specifically, the intracellular environment contains compounds, responsible for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and death, that are, therefore, promising drug targets. Thus, target sites can be distributed throughout the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi complex [9]. However, endosomes and lysosomes, which have a low pH and are rich in enzymes, can result in drug degradation or nonspecific distribution 10, 11. Thus, modulation of the size, charge, and surface composition of a nanomaterial can dictate the internalization pathway, enabling the nanomaterial to evade lysosomes and interact with its target organelle [12]. Indeed, the potential of nanomaterials to overcome such barriers has led to the development of platforms capable of improving their bioavailability [13].",

Epithelial cells also constitute a physiological barrier, because they are bond by TJs. Nanomaterials be modified physicochemically in response to low pH, high temperatures, reactions with surrounding molecules, in addition to changes to the weight and charge of the nanomaterial, which will also influence their absorption and degradation [17]. An additional barrier is the intestinal epithelium, which controls the passage of drugs into the blood. Its surface area, 99% of which is covered by enterocytes and microvilli, significant impacts absorption [18]. Morphologically, intestinal crypts comprise absorptive enterocytes and secretory cells (e.g., goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells).

TJ are gaps between cells and contain occludin and claudin-2 proteins, which aids paracellular transport because of their permeability [22]. The presence of TJs and a low surface area limit the transport of nanomaterials, because they cannot pass through the intestinal barrier via this route. The TJs must be reversibly opened by chemically modifying the nanomaterial using permeation enhancers, such as chitosan, polyacrylate, and thiolated polymers (anionic and cationic polymers) [23]. Thus, the paracellular pathway mainly transports hydrophilic drugs 3, 6.

Thiomers have the ability to mimic the mechanism of secreted mucus glycoproteins, covalently binding through disulfide bonds with cysteine from the mucus, enhancing their mucoadhesion and inhibiting enzyme actions [25]. Thus, thiomers remain concentrated at the absorption membrane as a result of the protection of their thiol groups and efflux inhibition [26]. Thiomers reduce oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH at the same time that thiol groups are oxidized to disulfide bonds, attaching the nanomaterial to the mucosa glycoproteins [27]. Then, GSH binds to the cysteine active site of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) via a disulfide bond, preventing PTP from remove the phosphate group from the tyrosine residues. This results in the TJs opening, improving the permeation properties of the nanomaterial and facilitating its diffusion [28]. An early study showed PTP inhibition using sodium orthovanadate, which led to tyrosine phosphorylation at TJs and improved the permeability in bovine corneal epithelial cells [29]. TJs are responsible for the uptake of hydrophilic nanomaterials throughout the paracellular route and their association with thiomers increases their apparent permeability 30, 31.",

            "text": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a receptor-mediated uptake mechanism, under the control of dynamin. Dynamin is a GTPase protein that leads to the division of clathrin pits from the membrane, resulting in the formation of small vesicles (60\u2013200 nm) coated in clathrin. After internalization, clathrin is removed by auxilin and HSC70 and vesicles are fused with Rab5 early endosomes 33, 37. This mechanism is seen as a housekeeping mechanism that degrades unwanted proteins and maintains cellular homeostasis; it is a route usually involving low-density lipoproteins, transferrins, and ligand\u2013receptor complexes [36]. Pharmacological inhibitors have been used to analyze the topology of endocytosis 38, 39. Steinbach and co-workers used chlorpromazine (specific for clathrin), nystatin (specific for caveolin), and LY294002 (specific for macropinocytosis) to show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis was the predominant mechanism for the internalization of nanoparticles (NPs) [39], as have other studies 37, 40. Yet, when nanomaterials are decorated with certain ligands, such as folic acid and cholesterol, caveolin-mediated endocytosis is the mechanism used [11], as demonstrated using albumin by Chanthick and colleagues [41]. Small caveolae-coated vesicles (50\u201380 nm), also under the control of dynamin, are formed through flask-shaped invaginations in a nonspecific uptake process. Therefore, caveolin is an integral membrane protein responsible for the formation of caveolae and, consequently, the formation of invaginations through caveolin-1 expression. Its morphology and functions differ depending on the cell type. During internalization, caveolae are endocytosed together with vesicles. Caveolae are similar to lipid rafts, because they also comprise cholesterol and sphingolipids, as well as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and several kinases. In contrast to clathrin, caveolae-mediated endocytosis requires a signal to begin. Endocytosis starts with tyrosine phosphorylation of the associated protein, which leads to depolymerization and enlistment of actin [36]. This leads to escape from the endolysosome and to the direct exocytosis of drug carriers 33, 35.",

In addition, polyacrylate, chitosan [52], phytic acid [53], and self-assembling lipid-like peptides [54] also work as enhancers, as well as thiomers and lectins [55]. These enhancers have the ability to reversibly open TJs, increasing the paracellular transport of macromolecular drugs because of the downregulation of occludin and claudin (TJ proteins), and the synergism of reductive effects of Ca2+\n56, 57. In terms of the latter, the cations bind with more affinity to polyacrylate derivatives, inhibiting lumen enzymes (e.g., trypsin). Thus, the polyacrylate-Ca2+ complex triggers the opening of TJs 58, 59. It was also demonstrated that cyclodextrin improves macromolecular absorption via pulmonary delivery [60]. Finally, an alternative strategy is the use of palmitoyl glycol chitosan hydrogels [61] or the development of liposomes with enhancers to delivery hydrophilic macromolecules [62].",

These fatty acids increase hydrophilic transport and reduce transepithelial electrical resistance, indicating the opening of TJs [74]. Paracellular transport has been related, in several papers, to the transport of poorly absorbed drugs. A study revealed the relation between paracellular transport and fatty acids and their effects on the absorption of mannitol, a paracellular marker, and on morphology changes of TJs [75].

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated and rigid, and are formed by the acidic hydrolysis of cellulose [83]. Nanocrystals have the ability to be loaded with high amounts of drug, which makes them an ideal way of obtaining pharmacological effects [82]. CNCs with PEI have been developed to delivery small interfering (si)RNA for gene silencing. As an antitumor strategy, this formulation protected the siRNA and facilitated its delivery into tumor cells via endosomal escape or the \u2018proton sponge effect\u2019 [84]. In another study, the effect of unmodified CNCs and their cationic derivatives was evaluated in mitochondria stress. The authors revealed that these compounds induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and an immune response [83]. The beneficial effect of nonfunctionalized CNCs was also demonstrated by adding them to \u03b2-lactoglobulin to prolong stability at low pH [85]. In addition, the surface pH influences the affinity, agglomeration, and aggregation of nanomaterials. According to some results, surface pH affects phagocytosis and cellular homeostasis, whereby TF-2 was able to trigger inflammatory responses at acid pH whereas TF-1, with a basic pH, suppressed the release of cytokines [86]. In terms of cellular internalization, nanocrystals enter cells through passive diffusion [87] or even by endocytosis 88, 89.",

For instance, porous NPs are characterized by a high loading capacity, chemical and physical robustness, low toxicity, and easy and cheap production. They can be divided into mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs) and porous silicon NPs (PSiNP) 91, 92. In both types, it is possible to avoid the prior release of drugs by controlling the binding affinity with cargos. Gatekeepers (e.g., AuNPs) can be attached to the pore outlets via covalent bonds that can be broken by an externally applied stimulus (e.g., light, magnetic field, ultrasound, or temperature) or by an internal stimulus inherent to the treated pathology (excluding acid or basic environments and the presence of enzymes) [13]. For instance, silica-encapsulated solid lipid (SESL) particles were developed for cinnarizine (CIN) delivery to overcome the limited oral absorption of this weakly basic drug because of its pH dependency under intestinal conditions [93]. Another example of inorganic NPs are QDs, which can be rapidly taken up by macrophages, and have the ability to move around the cytoplasm and target nuclear histones via nuclear pore complexes [94]. Despite their small size (2\u201310 nm), this ability is due to the charge associated with the QDs. QDs are also theranostic, showing the potential to promote drug delivery into cells [95]. Such intracellular drug delivery has been demonstrated with nonfunctionalized AuNPs, whereby unmodified AuNPs (i.e., without surface modification) were shown to interact cytoplasmically with pancreatic tumor cells [96].",

Liposomes, as a main nonviral vector, can be produced for pDNA delivery into cells via macropinocytosis [100]. Liposomes comprise 3\u20134 nm of lamellar phospholipid bilayers, with a hydrophilic center and a hydrophobic part of the membrane containing amphiphilic molecules. Liposomes are taken up by monocytes and macrophages, which is an advantage if the aim is to modulate immunity 16, 101.

Given that they are typically positively charged, CPPs, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sialic acids, interact electrostatically with negatively charged cells, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sialic acids, at the beginning of translocation [133]. A CPP-adaptor fusion protein, TAT-calmodulin (TAT-CaM), has been developed that results in efficient intracellular delivery and endosomal escape. In this example, there is reversible and high-affinity noncovalent binding that delivers the cargo into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells [134].

A previous study reported that 15 out of 32 lectins analyzed [e.g., Erythrina crista-galli lectin (ECL), Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (LEL), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)] bound to the apical membranes of airway epithelium and were taken up by endocytosis [138].

Polysaccharide-nanosystems association as well as sialyl LewisX, hyaluronic acid (HA), heparin, dextran, fucoidan, chitosan, and cyclodextrin are ligands that contribute to local drug delivery, stealthness, enhanced affinity, and stabilization against aggregation [142].",

Polyamine-based (e.g., PEI 20, 36) polymers have a pKa of approximately 5\u20137, which leads to the increased influx of ions via the inflow of water and consequently endosomal membrane rupture. In NP-endosome membrane fusion, fusogenic lipids are incorporated in the carriers. Fusogenic lipids comprise mainly alanine and glycine, as well as certain hydrophobic residues. For instance, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) is acid responsive, such that the acid pH drives glutamate and aspartate protonation, resulting in a new hexagonal conformational. This facilitates the insertion of fusogenic lipids between juxtaposed membranes and distroys the lipid packing 20, 36. In pore formation, after peptides bind in \u03b1-helical structure, they are obliquely inserted into the hydrophobic core of endosomal membrane, which stabilizes the transmembrane pore, and are then oriented via their hydrophilic structures. However, this does not happen during membrane disruption. In this instance, peptides bind to the hydrophilic part of phospholipids and undergo reorientation of their hydrophobic residues, resulting in an amphipathic \u03b1-helical structure, which allows peptides to cover the membrane like a carpet and causing disintegration by micellization of the membrane [36].",

By incorporating the second block, the authors were able to form micelles at physiological pH and disrupt the membrane at endosomal pH, promoting endosomal escape and intracellular delivery of the first block [146]. Other examples include hydrophobic amino acid R groups to aid viral escape from endosomes [147]; Ca2+\u2013siRNA nanocomplexes, where electrotastic interactions lead to siRNA release into the cytoplasm [148]; and TMab4 variants, which resulted in a threefold improved endosomal escape via membrane pores [144].

            "text": "Those nanomaterials that have an intracellular destiny utilize ER and Golgi routes as well as the retrograde trafficking pathway. This route is responsible for recycling several molecules, such as receptors, which are targeted by the Golgi complex [149]. ER and Golgi complexs are important for both secretory and endocytic pathways, and are also an option to escape the acidic lysosomal environment [12]. Yu and colleagues found a trafficking pathway between the ER and plasmatic membrane (PM), and then from the PM to ER via the Golgi complex. This trafficking was controlled by retromer-mediated endocytic recycling in the Golgi pathway [150]. Binding to the class A receptor enables internalization by caveolae-mediated endocytosis or the lipid raft-mediated pathway [11]. In early endosomes, the nanocarrier content is delivered into the ER, Golgi complex, mitochondria, or even outside the cells [151]. Syntaxin-6 [present in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes] has an important role in retrograde trafficking because of its tyrosine-based sorting motif, which regulates post-Golgi transport and the delivery of certain components, such as caveolin-1, into the membrane. The inhibition of syntaxin-6 proportionally decreases caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Thus, the transport of lipidic classes depends on syntaxin-6 [152]. In addition, syntaxin-6 also interferes with retrograde trafficking of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (in pancreatic \u03b2 cells) and insulin-responsive membrane proteins (in endocrine cells) to lysosomes, the TGN, and the insulin-responsive compartment. Du and collaborators demonstrated the movement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the Golgi complex via microtubule-dependent movement and its fusion with the complex via syntaxin-6. They also verified that the translocation is necessary for future fusion with the nucleus, which represents a pathway from the cell surface to the Golgi complex or even the nucleus [153]. Thus, this pathway would be preferred for nucleus-targeted delivery rather than diffusing throughout the cytoplasm [20].",

            "text": "The nucleus is organized as a double-layered lipidic envelope with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (size \u223c10 nm) that regulate flow of molecules in and out of the nucleus, and an underlying nuclear lamina. In practice, molecules >9 nm and a molecular weight higher >40 KDa cannot diffuse passively through NPCs. Large molecules need carriers to actively pass through the membrane, such as nuclear localization sequences (NLS). NLS present SV40 sequences containing basic residues (Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val) that are recognized by importins, a class of karyopherin-\u03b2 proteins responsible for nuclear import 155, 156. This organelle controls DNA transcription, reproduction, metabolism, and the cell cycle, and important functions such as electron transport, ATP synthesis, ROS generation, genetic programming, and cellular signaling regulation, can also be affected. It is possible to use nanomaterials smaller than nucleus pores by applying a positive charge to the nuclear membrane 10, 20, establishing interactions with nuclear signals or even using molecules with high affinity for DNA, such as C60-ser or the TAT peptide [7]. The nucleus a crucial role in the treatment of heart diseases, dystrophy, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and infection, in which gene mutations are common. Inducing nuclear membrane permeabilization or using nanomaterials coated with molecules that are recognized by nuclear receptors present in the cytoplasm (e.g., dexamethasone, which is identified by glucocorticoid receptors) are alternate ways to interfere with DNA transcription and genetic programming [156]. Various systems have been developed for gene delivery, which is the most common way of targeting the nucleus [157]. For instance, micelles with two synergetic anticancer drugs co-encapsulated into HA-vitamin E succinate were internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and accumulated in the nucleus. Cell apoptosis was confirmed, as was reverse multidrug resistance via CD44 targeting [158]. PLGA NPs have also been developed coated with AS1411 aptamer (Apt) and loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) with doxorubicin (DOX). Apt is used because it targets nucleolin. Nucleolin proteins are present in the nucleus and have an important role in angiogenesis and cell proliferation and adhesion. Thus, the combination of Apt with DOX is useful in the treatment with cancer, given that is a DNA intercalating agent [159]. Izeddin et al. developed a technique to track protein molecules in the nucleus and determine transcription factor (TF) dynamics. They found that c-Myc and P-TEFb were global and local explorers of the nucleus, respectively. The control of TFs influences gene regulation, and protein reactions and functions in the nucleus, which can be exploited for drug development [160]. Another interesting approach is the use of NPs containing a PEG-benzoic imine-oligo-L-lysine/iridium (III) metallodrug complex with pH-activated size reduction. Thus, at pH 7, they are large and protected by a PEG shell, whereas, at the acid pH of endosomes, NPs remain small because of the dissociation and detachment of PEG. This results in smaller NPs that present oligo-L-lysine that affects nuclear localization, favoring translocation into the nucleus [161].",

They are responsible for cellular homeostasis and, thus, are a good target to interfere with via oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, production of ROS, intracellular signaling, and metabolism. Thus, it is unsurprising that mitochondria contribute to obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, neurodegeneration, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy, given that polymorphisms or mutations that occur in mitochondrial DNA result in deficient energy production. Therefore, lipophilicity and positive charges are required for mitochondrial targeting. The internal negative membrane potential of this organelle is a possible target for positively charged particles [7]. Mitochondriotropic molecules can be used to accumulate nanomaterials inside the cell, because they are amphiphilic. These molecules have the ability to escape endosomes and deliver their cargo into mitochondria [10]. Nanoformulations can be guided by mitochondrial processing proteinases (MPP), which process mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTSs) [162]. DQA, MTS, CdSe/ZnS QD, MITO-porter, PLGA-b-PEGTPP, and lipophilic cations are potential methods for use in this approach [7]. Recently, mitochondria targeting of cancer cells was attempted using a HA protective shell encapsulated with gold nanostars (AuNs) and DOX. The formulation was shown to be internalized via the CD44 receptor. Coated to the AuNs was triphenylphosphine-modified \u03b1-helical pro-apoptotic peptide (TPP-KLA), which localizes to mitochondria, interrupt their membranes, inducing dysfunction and, thus, apoptosis [163]. Folate-coated chitosan NPs loaded ursolic acid have also been proposed as an antibreast cancer drug. It was confirmed that these NPs were internalized via a folate-receptor mediated endocytotic pathway. After destroying the permeability of lysosomal membrane, NPs were localized into mitochondria, resulting in the overproduction of ROS, destroying the mitochondrial membrane potential and causing apoptosis of the cancer cells [164]. Several polymeric conjugations are now available, especially for cancer. Chitosan has also been used to reach mitochondria by conjugating it with mitochondria-targeting ligand triphenylphosphine (TPP) to deliver ionidamine and siRNA and to trigger the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [165]. Thus, the most appropriate way to target mitochondria and the metabolic pathway is to coat nanomaterials with mitochondrial targeting signals and/or peptides conjugated with proapoptotic drugs.",

            "text": "The ER is organized in membrane structures called \u2018cisternae\u2019 separated by intermembrane spaces. It is in this organelle that protein folding and lipid biosynthesis occur. It is also responsible for controlling drug detoxification, apoptosis, immune responses, and signaling pathways. It is also is where peptides are loaded to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and antigens are delivered, thus it acts as a presentation site [10]. Protein transport is mediated by a KDEL sequence that works as a localization signal, which is recognized by its receptor (KDEL-R), expressed in ER. Thus, the ER is an appropriate pharmaceutical target, using a biomimetic approach. Another method for ER targeting is the use of localization signals or antibodies against ER receptors that lead to ER stress, protein misfolding and aggregation, calcium homeostasis disturbance, and exposure to free radicals [7]. Associated with ER dysfunctions are infectious and protein-folding diseases, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases [154]. Murugan and colleagues developed mesoporous silica NP pores loaded with topotecan and coated with poly(acrylic acid)-chitosan conjugated with quercetin. This approach resulted in breast cancer cell death because of structural changes in organelles such as the ER, nucleus, and mitochondria [166]. For the treatment of diabetes, the imaging O2\n\u2022\u2212 using two photon fluorescent probes (ER-BZT) followed by treatment with metformin has been proposed. Given that the production of ROS leads to ER stress and disease formation [167], it was found that the natural compound jaceosidin contributes to sarco-ER Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) upregulation, decreasing ER stress [168]. Targeting the liposomal ER, phospholipids, KDEL sequence, and KDEL-R antibodies are reviewed elsewhere [7].",

The main function of the Golgi complex is N- or O-glycosylation, and protien transport and sorting, in addition to its influence on lipid biosynthesis [169]. The TGN is in the center of both the endocytic and exocytic pathways, with an important role in straightening lipids and proteins. It is normally associated with ER, given that different cargos are transported from there to the cis-Golgi network and then to TNG, where cargos are sorted and forwarded to their destinations [170]. Matsuto and colleagues demonstrated that BICD2 enables Rab6A binding to the Golgi complex. They also showed that Rab6A and BICD2 are responsible for the fusion between Golgi tubules and the ER in retrograde trafficking [171]. It is unsurprising that Golgi complex dysfunctions contributes to various diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes [154]. In 2011, a Golgi complex-targeting signal was discovered in a coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome. It was shown that, in the cytoplasmic tail, there is a beta-hairpin structural motif that controls Golgi complex localization [172]. Exploiting this motif could be a way of improving the targeting of the Golgi complex. Banfield has also described several mechanisms of protein retention in the Golgi complex, such as kin recognition, transmembrane domain-mediated and amino acid sequence motifs, which could also be targeted for drug delivery [169].",

SH3 and SH2 of SLAP can be delivered into the cytoplasm to inhibit T cell receptors, which can be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases [174]. Typically, this organelle is targeted when infectious and autoimmune diseases and familial hypercholesterolemia occur [8]. There are several approaches available that allow the delivery of nanomaterials into the cytoplasm, such as CPPs [175] and cationic nanomaterials [176]. Liposomes with fusogenic properties [177] or that are pH sensitive have also been studied as drug carriers [178], given that they have the ability to destabilize endosomal membranes and release drugs into the cytoplasm [9]. The use of polyampholyte NPs and freeze concentration has been suggested to deliver proteins into the cytoplasm [174], as has the application of a faded electric treatment for siRNA delivery [179] via connectosomes and diffusion across TJs [180], bubble liposomes and ultrasound [181].

Currently 43 drugs have been approved as nanopharmaceuticals (reviewed in [182]). For example, for intracellular applications, Feraheme\u2122 (Ferumoxytol) was approved in 2009 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the iron deficiency anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease. This nanopharmaceutical comprises SPIONS coated with dextran, and the iron is released inside macrophages, from where it is then added to the intracellular storage iron pool or transferred to plasma transferrin. In 2014, Plegridy\u00ae (Biogen), a polymer-protein conjugate (PEGylated IFN beta-1a) with improved protein stability due to PEGylation, was approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. This drug binds to type I interferon receptors on the surface of cells and causes intracellular events that lead to the regulation of interferon-responsive gene expression. Similarly, in 2015, Onivyde\u00ae (liposomal Irinotecan) was approved by the FDA for treating pancreatic cancer, because it increases the intracellular uptake of irinotecan and reduces the systemic toxicity arising from adverse effects (www.fda.gov/).",

However, there are several parameters that must be taken into account, such as their size, charge, composition, and shape, because these are correlated with cell uptake, long circulation times, renal clearance, and drug stability. As discussed above, there are various obstacles that must be overcome for successful drug delivery, culminating in the final step characterized by endosomal escape, organelle location, and membrane translocation. Some drugs require delivery to a specific organelle, increasing the delivery challenge. It is evident that organelle dysfunction is the origin of several diseases; therefore, one treatment strategies is to target a set of organelles to reach the desired therapeutic effect.",

Finally, a biomimetic strategy could be a way to improve intracellular transport and/or exocytosis.

            "text": "Figure 3: Pathways of receptor endocytosis. Endocytosis involves the capture of transmembrane proteins and their extracellular ligands into cytoplasmic vesicles that are pinched off from the plasma membrane. The best-studied pathway of receptor internalization is mediated by clathrin-coated pits. These are small areas of the plasma membrane that are covered on the cytoplasmic surface with clathrin triskelions, which comprise three clathrin heavy chains and three clathrin light chains assembled into a polyhedral clathrin lattice. Receptors are recruited to clathrin-coated pits by directly interacting with the clathrin coat adaptor complex AP2 or by binding to other adaptor proteins, which in turn interact with the clathrin heavy chain and/or AP2. Clathrin-coated pits invaginate inwards with the help of several accessory proteins and pinch off to form clathrin-coated vesicles in a process that requires the GTPase dynamin. Several clathrin-independent pathways of endocytosis also exist, although the precise mechanisms and structural components involved in these pathways are not well understood. Endocytic vesicles derived from both clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis fuse with early endosomes. Endosomal trafficking is controlled by several Rab proteins, which are small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily. Each GTP-bound Rab protein resides in a particular type of endosome and functions by recruiting specific effector proteins. Following their internalization into early RAB5-containing endosomes, receptors can rapidly recycle back to the plasma membrane by a RAB4-dependent mechanism, traffic to the recycling compartment that contains RAB11A, or remain in endosomes, which mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and late endosomes. MVBs are defined by the presence of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which are formed by inward membrane invagination involving endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes. Early-to-late endosome maturation involves the acquisition of RAB7 and the removal of endosomal components that are capable of, and necessary for, recycling. In the MVBs, cargo destined for degradation is incorporated into ILVs. Fusion of late endosomes and MVBs with lysosomes carrying proteolytic enzymes results in cargo degradation.
