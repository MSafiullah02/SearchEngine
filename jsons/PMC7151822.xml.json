The nasolacrimal orifice is positioned on the medial aspect of the lateral cartilaginous wall of the nasal cavity and is usually just beyond what may be seen without an endoscope. This narrowness may be an adaptation to moisten and warm inspired air in the dry, hot, or cold native environments. Regardless of the cause, the narrowness of the airway allows small amounts of compromise to severely restrict air flow and also means that many diagnostic or therapeutic modalities such as paranasal endoscopy and nasogastric or nasotracheal intubation are more difficult to perform on camelids than on some other species. Of the passages, the ventral meatus is the largest, and its ventromedial component represents the widest, straightest path to the larynx. Its dorsal component is approximately half the diameter and often too narrow to allow passage of a tube or endoscope. Therefore, it is helpful to manually press either of those items as ventromedially as possible during entry in to the nose.",

The median artery is found between the shoulder and the elbow, running along the craniomedial aspect of the humerus. Its pulse is usually palpable, although the structure of the artery itself usually is not. It is usually approached perpendicularly (see Figure 37-1\n). The saphenous artery is often both visible and palpable from medial midthigh to below the stifle. It is usually approached in a near-parallel fashion, often from its dorsal aspect to avoid puncturing the accompanying vein (Figure 37-2\n). Both arteries are useful in neonates; the saphenous vein is also used extensively in adults.",

Although externally narrow, it widens con\u00adsiderably at the level of the molars; with a small enough endoscope and sufficient lubrication, valuable information can be obtained. With persistence, a 6-millimeter (mm) external diameter scope will pass on most crias and adult alpacas, and adult llamas may accommodate 9-mm scopes fairly easily. In dyspneic camelids, endoscopy does reduce available airway and may lead to distress of the patient, so procedures should be completed as quickly as possible.

            "text": "The most common cause of dyspnea is dorsal displacement of the soft palate, possibly compounded by dorsal pharyngeal collapse or epiglottic entrapment. In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown, but it is postulated that this is part of the stress response, especially in weakened or sedated camelids. In some cases, fatigue of the airway musculature caused by chronic high airway resistance or a neuromuscular defect may play a role. Clinical signs include dyspnea, stridor, open-mouthed breathing, dorsiflexion of the head and neck, regurgitation, nystagmus, and death. Definitive diagnosis requires upper airway endoscopy (Figure 37-3\n), but the diagnosis can often be inferred, as endoscopy of patients in respiratory distress may be unnecessarily life threatening. Possible treatments include administration of nasal oxygen, maintaining the head and neck in extension, placing a towel over the eyes to reduce sensory input, reversal of sedative medications, and tracheostomy. When stress is the causative factor, handling to administer medications, draw blood samples, maintain the neck in a certain position, or perform other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures may worsen the condition. Such camelids may improve if allowed to recover on their own. However, camelids with spontaneous dorsiflexion rarely improve without some degree of intervention. When this appears to be a permanent condition, a permanent tracheostomy may be necessary and greatly improve the animal's quality of life.",

It results from failure of the buccopharyngeal membranes to completely rupture during the early second trimester of fetal development, leaving membranous or bony obstructions over one or both nasal passages (Figure 37-5\n). Camelids with unilateral lesions may thrive into adulthood, showing little more than a heightened respiratory rate, open-mouthed breathing, or dyspnea when stressed. Bilaterally affected neonates are born with little or no ability to breathe nasally. Thus, clinical signs start immediately or soon after birth. Affected crias typically display open-mouthed breathing, with the lips pulled away from the mouth, stertor (inspiratory or expiratory), and pronounced nostril flaring (Figure 37-6\n). They often have difficulty eating and are at high risk for aspiration. Air flow at the nostrils is absent or reduced, and soft rubber tubes cannot be passed nasally beyond the level of the eye. Definitive diagnosis may be achieved by endoscopic examination with a pediatric endoscope (up to approximately 6 mm diameter), plain radiography, contrast radiology, in which approximately 5 to 10 milliliters (mL) of contrast (preferably an organic iodide to reduce risk of aspiration complications) is instilled into each nasal passage and the nose held in dorsal extension (Figure 37-7\n), or more advanced imaging techniques that allow the nasal passages to be displayed in slices. Aerophagia and hyperinflated lungs may also be seen. Endoscopy or contrast radiography reveals imperforate membranes or bony obstruction. Mucoid fluid may obscure the actual obstruction. Plain radiography reveals bony obstruction only and may be difficult to interpret. Clinical pathology data reflect stress or secondary aspiration pneumonia. Blood oxygenation is usually poor. Tracheostomy or surgical repair are possible and provide immediate relief, but camelids frequently outgrow these stomata and repeated procedures may be necessary.10\n",

Cattle are the usual reservoir species because they often suffer prolonged viremia after infection and rarely show signs of acute clinical disease. The disease is spread by biting Culicoides flies (midges), occasionally through semen, and occasionally transplacentally. Most transmission is strongly linked to fly season. Although cattle rarely show more than occasional reproductive problems, including abortion and birth defects, some other species, particular sheep and some wild cervids and ruminants, often suffer severe, often lethal disease. The underlying lesion is vasculitis. Common clinical signs include fever, anorexia, facial and lingual edema, oral ulceration, cyanosis, lameness, and dyspnea.

Bluetongue virus was identified by PCR in blood, lungs, the heart, lymph nodes, and the spleen. Other camelids in the herds remained healthy. It is still not known whether the affected camelids had some cause for particular susceptibility, their immune system was overwhelmed by the amount of viral challenge during the outbreak, or these represent the innate susceptibility of camelids to bluetongue. Lack of previous reports in spite of evidence of seroconversion makes the last possibility seem less likely. Preventative measures include fly control, protection from flies, and possibly vaccination. Vaccines are available in endemic or threatened areas and should be given at least 3 weeks before the onset of the fly season. The initial vaccination is a two-injection series at 3-week intervals, followed by an annual booster as long as the danger persists.34 Since Culicoides flies are most active after dusk, evening confinement in barns with fly screens may offer the most practical protection.",

With S. zooepidemicus very common in most places with sizeable equine populations, and llamas and alpacas becoming more common, transspecies transmission was just a matter of time. Alpaca fever appears to start as a superficial infection of wounds, the prepuce, or the udder that causes local swelling and discomfort, or as a generalized internal infection. Superficial infections may become generalized, and about half the affected camelids die. Generalized infections may be cleared, leaving abscesses, usually in the abdominal cavity or lungs. In North America, the organism has been isolated from blood, milk, uterine discharges, abscesses, wounds, and body cavity exudates (pleural or peritoneal fluid). Affected camelids have shown a broad spectrum of different clinical signs, ranging from infertility, uterine discharges, abnormal milk, and superficial swelling to tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, tenesmus, diarrhea, and colic. Signs of internal infection are accompanied by fever (102.5\u00b0F\u2013106\u00b0F), depression, and anorexia, but these may not be present with focal disease. Most camelids with the generalized form of this streptococcal disease show signs referable to the abdominal cavity, and a smaller number also or predominately show respiratory signs.38 This has given rise to the belief that the organism gains access to the body through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and not the respiratory tract or lymphoreticular organs, as occurs with most other streptococcal infection (in horses, humans, etc.). This is probably untrue. Research has demonstrated the efficiency of respiratory infection, and greater use of ultrasonography in the diagnostic evaluation of sick camelids has identified pleuritis in a high percentage of cases.37 Alternative forms of transmission are also possible; anecdotally, this infection has been seen in camelids after orogastric intubation and reproductive examinations using equipment that may have been previously used on horses.",

Equine strangles vaccines should not be used; the older ones cause severe abscessation in llamas, and the newer ones have not been tested. In South America, the organism is thought to be a widespread oral commensal, so no effort is made to prevent transmission from animal to animal. Instead, preventing stressful management practices and rough handling are emphasized. Several studies on camelids in North America have not supported the theory that the organism is an oral or respiratory tract commensal. Also, herd outbreaks outside of South America are rare.39 Instead, cases occur sporadically, occasionally in camelids recently exposed to horses. This raises new issues on how transmission occurs. Aerosol transmission of S. zooepidemicus, a common pharyngeal commensal of horses, occurs between horses (and humans), and infection is thought to occur through the respiratory tract. It is likely that such transmission occurs to camelids and possibly between camelids and that measures used to prevent the transmission of other respiratory pathogens will limit the spread of this infection as well.",

If feed material has reached the lungs, the camelid should be treated aggressively with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs. Many upper airway and forestomach bacteria are facultative anaerobes, so the chosen antimicrobial agents should cover that spectrum. Combinations of an aminoglycoside with a \u03b2-lactam agent are common, potentially with the addition of metronidazole.

Camelids covered with fleece and not monitored carefully may develop advanced disease before it is detected, and anecdotal evidence suggests that infection may take years to become apparent in some camelids. Premortem evaluations have been relatively limited. The most common signs are weight loss, weakness, lethargy, recumbency, and anorexia. External lymphadenopathy may be detectable in some animals; internal lymphadenopathy may also be detectable through rectal palpation or imaging studies. The minority show respiratory signs, which may include a shallow breathing pattern with increased expiratory effort, and general harshness of lung sounds. Hematologic abnormalities may include anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and lymphocytosis. Often, marked hyperglobulinemia with concurrent hypoalbuminemia exists. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonographic evaluation of the chest, liver, spleen, and regional lymph nodes may reveal multifocal radiodense or hyperechoic nodular lesions, possibly coalescing into diffuse areas of consolidation. Biopsies or aspirates of these or transtracheal wash samples may reveal acid-fast bacilli, which may be identified by mycobacterial culture and typed by PCR. Typing is important because the different pathogens have different legal aspects and zoonotic potential. Mycobacterial diseases are reportable in many areas.",

Wind may spread the fungus beyond its normal range, but reports of disease far outside of this range are rare. It is postulated that camelids aerosolize and inspire infective arthroconidia during dust baths. Once inspired, arthroconidia grow and mature, and release endospores, which cause local or, much more commonly, disseminated pyogranulomatous disease. Transplacental infection may occur. Many mammalian species are susceptible, although most ruminants suffer only from local disease in the mediastinal lymph nodes.

Caution must be exercised when interpreting the importance of Aspergillus hyphae in tracheal wash or exudate samples because the fungus may be found in the upper airway of healthy camelids. Fungal culture and culture characteristics may be used to identify the causative agent. Because of the infectivity of Coccidioides, all manipulations should be done on sealed samples or within suitable biohazard hoods. Skin lesions may be aspirated or biopsied. Skin testing and serum complement fixation appear to offer inconclusive results.

Camelids grazed in proximity to infested cattle, sheep, or cervids should be considered at highest risk. Both Dictyocaulus viviparus and D. filari appear to have the potential to infest camelids.79 Adult worms live in the bronchi, where they produce eggs that the host coughs up and swallows. Larvae hatch within the intestinal tract and are passed in feces. They mature on pasture to be reingested later. Mature larvae invade through the small intestine and move through blood or lymphatics back to the lung. Most disease relates to the pulmonary larval migration and hence may appear within the 4 to 5 week prepatent period. Affected camelids have productive cough and dyspnea and are typically afebrile. Diagnosis may be made by examining fresh feces using the Baermann technique. Larvae found in fresh feces are likely to be from lungworms or Strongyloides. Pulmonary radiography or computed tomography (CT) may reveal lesions resembling patchy granulomatous disease and tracheal or BAL samples may contain adults, eggs, or larvae. Benzimidazole, avermectin, and levamisole have all shown activity against lungworms in ruminants. Contact animals, especially ruminant hosts, should be treated at the same time.",

Diagnosis is accomplished by identifying the herniated viscera on an imaging study; radiography, ultrasonography, or cross-sectional imaging techniques may all be used. Diagnosis may also be achieved during exploratory surgery to identify the cause of the colic. In that case, extreme care must be taken to avoid abrupt, severe pneumothorax on opening the abdomen or retrieving the viscera through the defect. One report described a 7-year-old llama gelding with incarceration of the ileum, cecum, and ascending colon within the thorax through a smooth-edged diaphragmatic defect.83 Because of the nature of the defect, a congenital lesion was suspected. Herniation recurred 9 months after surgical repair.
