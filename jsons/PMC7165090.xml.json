The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B). The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with close contact to COVID-19 patients and droplet secretions of those patients. According to a report from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to February 24th 2020, 3387 medical staffs were confirmed with COVID-19, of which were mainly occurred in January 2019 from Hubei Province (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology, 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The occurrence of healthcare-associated infections might be closely related to pathogens contamination in the hospital environment (Beggs et al., 2015, Chowell et al., 2015). The outbreak of this novel virus placed challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the isolation wards in general hospitals have all been transformed into temporary infectious disease wards.",

Though the data was limited, it appeared that the survival capacity of various human coronavirus was different (Chan et al., 2011, van Doremalen et al., 2013). Recently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from a door handle in a confirmed COVID-19 patient's home by centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) in Guangzhou, China. It was also reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in hospital environment in Singapore (Ong et al., 2020). Hence, comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the outbreak of the pandemic is significant to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control.",

Confirmed patients of COVID-19 were hospitalized in the 3 isolation wards including one Isolation Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ward and two general Isolation wards. Each isolation ward was separated into three parts and two passages. Three zones including contaminated area, semi-contaminated area, and clean area. A contaminated area is a specifically designated area for patients of COVID-19 and contaminated items such as patients\u2019 wastes. A clean area is a specifically designated area for non-contaminated items. Patients should not enter the clean area. Semi-contaminated area was set up between the contaminated area and the clean area. The items were potentially polluted can be placed in this area. Doctor's offices were placed in this area. While two passages are a passage for medical staff and a passage for patients. Buffer room is set up between a contaminated zone and a semi-contaminated zone. In each isolation ward, two buffer zones are set up for removing the staff PPEs in accordance with the transmission features of COVID-19. The suspected patients of COVID-19 were nursed in single rooms, while the confirmed patients of COVID-19 were cohorted in cubicles with bed spacing of not less than 1.2 meters. The isolation rooms were not under negative pressure because the isolation wards were reconducted temporarily.",

Stool specimens of COVID-19 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that viral shedding in stool might be a potential route of transmission which was also reported in SARS previously (Wang et al., 2005). In recent studies, environmental sampling also has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV-2 (Ong et al., 2020). If SARS-CoV-2 transfers to hands or other equipment at a concentration above the infectious dose, it will initiate infection through contact with the eyes, nose or mouth by indirect contact. Thus, an effective disinfection is very necessary for hospital infection control and medical staffs\u2019 protection. With the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the isolation wards in general hospitals have all been transformed into temporary wards in order to meet the standard of isolation wards in infectious disease hospitals. Such temporary isolation wards might have many concerns. Further environmental monitoring assessments are necessary.",

With routine cleaning and disinfection, none of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected among object surfaces in isolation wards including the clean area, the semi-contaminated area, and the contaminated area. Siegel et al. reported that medical ventilators might generate respiratory aerosols that have been associated with an increased risk of occupationally acquired infection among healthcare personnel (Siegel et al., 2007). We also detected the object surfaces such as bed rails and nightstands surrounding the COVID-19 patients with or without mechanical ventilation. The two patients\u2019 respiratory specimens were both positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, while the stool specimen of patient A with mechanical ventilation was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but that of patient B without mechanical ventilation was negative. The object surfaces closely surrounding the two patients with or without mechanical ventilation were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The sampling time was about 4 h after objects disinfection with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. It indicated that the current disinfection measure was effective in isolation wards in hospital. The negative SARS-COV-2 RNA results of the objects surfaces such as door handles, PDA and gloves of staffs also suggested the effectiveness of the high hand hygiene compliance of staffs in isolation wards. Also, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected among front surface of N95 masks of staffs in isolation wards. It also indicated that our staffs with PPE in the transformed isolation wards with current disinfection measure were in low risk of infection. In this study all the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were negative.",

For sufficient disinfection of SARS-CoV-2, preprocessing disinfection equipment were added before the sewage drained into the last disinfection pool. Though the sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection equipment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the final outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. In order to identify the viability of the SARS-CoV-2, viral culture was done among these sewage from various points. All of the sewage samples from various points were negative for viral culture. This finding also indicated that the sewage drained from the hospital could not lead to transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.",
