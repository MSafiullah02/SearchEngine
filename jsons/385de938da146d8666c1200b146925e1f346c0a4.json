Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels 63 before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation 64 followed by maximal CRP. Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort 65 were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83. The calculated optimal 66 cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6> 80 pg/ml and CRP> 67 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk 68 of respiratory failure. 69 Conclusion: Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for 70 mechanical ventilation.

However, to our knowledge 282 our study is the first to demonstrate a prospective prediction of the end point \"mechanical 283 ventilation\", which is of high clinical relevance not only for patient treatment but also for 284 resource planning. Very recent publications provide additional data that strengthen the role of 285 IL-6 and CRP in COVID-19 as predictive markers 22, 23 . Unfortunately, these studies did not 286 include a prospective validation cohort and sometimes did not mention analysis platforms 22 . 287 A further difference between our and other studies is the dramatic discrepancy in mortality of 288 severely diseased patients. We are not able to analyze mortality as an end point because 289 only two patients had died until April 12 th . This number has only increased by one until May 290 6 th (overall mortality 3.4%). While still some patients are in critical condition and the mortality 291 rate in our cohort is likely to increase in the next weeks it will be significantly below those 292 reported. We can only speculate about the reasons for this huge difference but argue that 293 overwhelmed hospitals and patient selection might have contributed to the increased 294 mortality observed in other studies.

However, our validation cohort at least exists of 63% of severe patients due to the available parameters (2% with mild and Since the start of the pandemic, hundreds of research articles on COVID-19 have been 301 published 25 . To our knowledge, we report the first predictive marker for respiratory failure 302 that was prospectively validated in an independent cohort. Although our sample sizes were 303 small, the large difference in risk for respiratory failure between the high-risk and the low-risk 304 group made it possible to successfully validate our findings. Interestingly, a study of 134 305 patients with avian-origin H7N9 influenza in 2013 also showed a strong correlation of IL-6 306 and disease severity. In analogy to our findings, this study reports that IL-6 plasma levels 307 >80 pg/ml were found in all patients with lethal outcome compared to only 8.3% in surviving 308 patients 9 . The combined cohort (n=89) produced an only slightly lower cutoff for IL-6 (65 309 pg/ml) while the cutoff for CRP levels remained the same at 97 mg/l when calculated from 310 the combined cohort. However, even the combined sample size is probably too small to 311 determine an optimal cutoff value. Furthermore, the acceptable proportion of falsely identified 312 low-risk patients, and therefore the set threshold, is largely dictated by the availability of 313 health care resources. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to 314 formally address this issue. We want to stress that IL-6 and CRP should be used as a 315",
