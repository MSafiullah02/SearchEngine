Gastric emptying may be affected by infant maturity, medications (e.g., methylxanthines, mydriatics), feed composition (formula versus breastmilk), feeding method (bolus versus continuous feedings), infant position, tube position, and infant state (e.g., respiratory distress, infection). Theoretically, evaluation of gastric residuals may cause harm: for example, repetitive negative pressure from aspiration may injure sensitive gastric mucosa, and discarding gastric residuals may result in the loss of essential gastric enzymes, gastric acid, and important nutrients [4].

This may have led to conscious or unconscious biases in clinical decisions (e.g., daily feeding advancement) that affected study outcomes (e.g., daily enteral feeding volumes). Among infants who underwent routine evaluation for gastric residuals, the authors did not specify how residuals were handled. Differences in approach (discarding versus refeeding) could systematically and independently affect enteral nutritional intake in the residual group. It is noteworthy that 18 of 69 (26%) infants randomized to no routine gastric residual evaluation had \u22651 residuals evaluated for signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction, leading to crossover between the study groups. Also, the trial did not enroll an adequate number of infants to detect potentially meaningful differences in important outcomes such as death or NEC.",

Multivariable analyses\u2014that is, when the effect of a primary variable (e.g., treatment allocation) is adjusted to account for the effect of other variables\u2014may be familiar to clinicians from observational studies where patients are not randomly and prospectively assigned to an intervention.

            "text": "Reasons to perform multivariable analyses in the analysis of trial outcomes include: [7]Obtaining appropriate confidence intervals and p values after stratified randomizationSome trials use stratification methods to ensure that equal numbers of infants at a given center (in a multicenter trial) or from certain birthweight or gestational age groups are randomized to each arm (e.g., when stratified by center, performed so that a center that enrolls ~x infants in the intervention arm also enrolls ~x infants in the control arm). The effect of the variables used for stratification should be accounted for by using a multivariable analysis of the primary outcome to avoid loss of study power and inappropriately large p values and wide confidence intervals for the treatment effect [8].Accounting for chance imbalance in important baseline variablesWhen stratified randomization is impractical, consideration is sometimes given to balancing important prognostic variables in the analysis phase only. While randomization promotes on-average balance of measured and unmeasured variables across treatment groups, it does not ensure balance of any particular variable. Importantly, the trial protocol should prospectively define multivariable adjustment planned for the primary analysis. Post hoc selection of variables may increase the risk of false-positive findings (type I error) [9, 10].Increased power to detect differences in outcomesAdjustment for prognostic variables (i.e., those that affect the outcome) in clinical trial analyses eliminates some of the variation in outcomes among patients unrelated to treatment assignment. For continuous outcome variables, multivariable adjustment reduces the standard error in the treatment effect (i.e., potentially makes the treatment groups less alike). In analyses of dichotomous (e.g., mortality) or time-to-event (e.g., days until full feeds) outcomes, multivariable adjustment results in an increase in standard error (which may lead to wider confidence intervals), but this is usually compensated for by an increase (away from the null) in the measured effect size. In both circumstances, trial power\u2014the ability to detect a statistically significant difference in outcomes between groups when one exists\u2014is increased [7, 11].",
