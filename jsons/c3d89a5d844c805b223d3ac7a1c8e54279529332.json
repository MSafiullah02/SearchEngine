The samples comprised mostly nose swabs but also included throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates. Chequerboard titrations on several of these samples showed that 1:200 dilutions of the nasal samples produced the highest absorbance values with 1:20 dilutions of the rabbit serum samples, and these dilutions were therefore used in the following experiments. Figure 2 shows that ELISA ratios obtained with 1 :200 dilutions of the children's nasal specimens using 1:20 dilutions of antisera to HCV 229E (Fig. 2a) and CV Paris (Fig. 2b) . A wide range of ELISA ratios were obtained for both HCV 229E and CV Paris antisera. As described above, ELISA ratios of 3.6 or more with HCV 229E antisera, and 3.0 or more with CV Paris antisera, were considered to contain HCV 229E and CV Paris antigens, respectively. We have shown previously that HCV 229E and CV Paris are representative members of the HCV 229E and HCV OC43 antigenic groups and that all HCVs can be detected by ELISA using one or the other of these antigens [Hasony and Macnaughton, 1982; Kraaijeveld et al, 1980b; Macnaughton, 1981; Macnaughton et al, 19811.
