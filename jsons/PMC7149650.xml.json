Diseases involving the uveal tract frequently cause a breakdown of this barrier, which leads to exudation of excessive amounts of proteins or cells into the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal space. The blood-ocular barrier is composed primarily of a blood-retinal barrier and a blood-aqueous barrier. The blood-retinal barrier is formed at the level of the retinal capillary vascular endothelium, which is nonfenestrated and has tight junctions, and the retinal pigment epithelium, which also has tight junctions and separates the relatively leaky choroidal blood vessels from the overlying retina. The blood-aqueous barrier is formed by tight junctions at the level of the nonfenestrated iridal vascular endothelium and between cells constituting the nonpigmented ciliary body epithelium. Most large molecules, especially proteins, are unable to pass through or between the cells in this barrier system. The exact anatomic location of the barrier is probably different for different substances (e.g., capillary endothelial cells, endothelial basement membrane, and intercellular junctions). By limiting the amount of protein and other large molecules that may scatter light in the aqueous and vitreous humor, these barriers serve to create a more optically perfect media.

PPMs can usually be differentiated from inflammatory anterior or posterior synechia on the basis of their origin near the iris collarette region (versus an origin at the pupillary margin for synechia) and their presence at birth. It usually is possible to see the membrane extending from the iris collarette region to the cornea or lens, although occasionally the membrane may have broken free and the cornea or lens opacity (often pigmented) is all that remains.

Although each of these schemes has its own advantages and disadvantages, classification into granulomatous or nongranulomatous and then by specific etiology is probably the most useful method in a clinical setting, because it also helps guide specific therapy (Table 11-5\n). This scheme, however, is plagued by the presence of a large percentage of patients having idiopathic uveitis in which the cause remains obscure and therapy can be only nonspecific and directed at controlling inflammation and preventing further damage to the eye. Presumably, most of these cases are immune-mediated or involve microorganisms that are not yet recognized as pathogenic.

Several reports have described isolation of L. interrogans from various ocular fluids, especially the vitreous, in horses with chronic ERU. The organism is difficult to culture, however, and results of polymerase chain reaction testing for leptospiral DNA are typically positive in many animals that are culture-negative, suggesting that the organism may be more prevalent than once thought. Serum antibody titers greater than 1:400 are suggestive of previous infection, although lower serologic titers may be found in many infected horses. In fact, negative serologic titers do not necessarily rule out leptospirosis as a possible cause, because the organism or its DNA is occasionally identified in the intraocular fluids of horses with negative serologic titer results. Interpretation of serologic test results may be further confounded by the occurrence of positive serologic titer results for Leptospira in horses without uveitis.

            "text": "There are at least two main theories as to the role of Leptospira in ERU. In the first theory, ERU after infection with Leptospira is primarily an immune-mediated disorder in which the organism is no longer present. In this scenario autoimmune inflammation tends to \u201cburn out\u201d as antiinflammatory regulatory cells get the upper hand in an active attack, leading to a clinically quiescent period. Recurrent active periods may be the result of the autoimmune response shifting from one site to another on the same autoantigen (intramolecular spreading) or to another entirely different autoantigen (intermolecular spreading). This theory is supported by the responsiveness of the disease to immunosuppressive therapy, which, if viable organism were to be present in the eye, would be expected to ultimately result in an exacerbation of the inflammation. Alternatively, it has been theorized that persistence of L. interrogans in the vitreous humor of horses with ERU can induce and maintain an autoimmune uveitis. During the periods between overt episodes, the number of leptospiral organisms may decline to such a level that overt inflammation is not clinically detectable, and antibody titers decline. When the antibody titer falls below a certain threshold, bacterial numbers may increase, resulting in a resurgence of antibodies that cross-react with host antigens, leading to greater inflammation, damage to adjacent tissues, and, perhaps, recognition of new antigenic epitopes. This theory is supported by the observation that infusion of antibiotics into the vitreal cavity in conjunction with a surgical vitrectomy may greatly reduce the frequency of recurrent episodes.",

            "text": "In general the number of medications and frequency of the therapy are adjusted in accordance with the severity of the clinical signs. Mild disease may be treated with topical therapy alone, whereas more severe inflammation typically demands systemic therapy as well. Initial therapy usually includes the following measures:1.Attempt to establish a definitive etiologic diagnosis, and specifically address the cause if possible.2.Ensure good husbandry practices: Place the horse in a dark stall to relieve photophobia. Prevent ocular trauma by mowing pastures and removing sharp objects from the environment. Reduce contact with cattle and wildlife that may harbor leptospirosis, prevent access to ponds and swampy areas, and ensure good insect and rodent control. Minimize stress, ensure a good diet, and employ an optimal deworming schedule. Vaccinations should be optimized for each patient and based on the horse's use and specific needs. Multiple vaccinations should be spaced at least 1 week apart so as to avoid excessive antigenic stimulation and potential exacerbation of the disease.3.Atropine ointment (1%) applied 1 to 4 times a day. This medication reduces pain by relaxing the ciliary muscle, aids in the prevention of synechia, and may help stabilize the blood-aqueous barrier. Atropine should be discontinued or reduced in frequency if the horse shows reduced gut motility and/or colic. Resistance to pupillary dilation is an indicator of the severity of the uveitis, the presence of synechia, or both. Once the uveitis is controlled, the pupil may remain dilated for days to weeks, especially if the drug was used frequently during an acute attack.4.Systemic NSAIDs (listed here in order of potency\u2014use only 1 at a time):\u2022Flunixin meglumine 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg q12h, IV, IM, or PO for 5 days; then, if required by the severity of the inflammation and if patient is appropriately monitored for gastric and renal side effects, 0.25 mg/kg PO q12-24h on a more long-term basis. If after 5 days systemic antiinflammatory therapy is still required, many ophthalmologists switch from flunixin meglumine to phenylbutazone. Flunixin meglumine may also facilitate pupillary dilation by atropine because endogenous prostaglandins can induce miosis by directly acting on the iris sphincter muscle; this action is blocked by NSAIDS but not by atropine.\u2022Phenylbutazone 1 g per adult horse (or up to 4.4 mg/kg) q12-24h IV or PO. This drug typically is used after a 5-day course of flunixin meglumine if additional systemic antiinflammatory therapy is required. On occasion, with appropriate monitoring for gastric and renal toxicity, it is used as long-term therapy in an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of acute episodes, especially if aspirin is ineffective at such reductions.\u2022Aspirin 25 mg/kg PO q12-24h (12.5 g/500 kg). Typically this agent is used in horses in which long-term topical anti-inflammatory therapy cannot prevent recurrent outbreaks and long-term systemic NSAID therapy is required.\u2022Consider ranitidine (6.6 mg/kg q8h) and sucralfate (20 mg/kg PO q8h) or omeprazole (4 mg/kg PO q24h) for gastric ulcer prophylaxis in foals.\n5.Topical corticosteroids (e.g., 0.1% dexamethasone ointment, 1.0% prednisolone) applied every 1 to 6 hours, depending on severity. Long-term therapy is often required, and it is generally advisable to treat an acute episode for at least 2 weeks after the apparent resolution of all signs of active inflammation. In many patients long-term topical corticosteroid therapy is required to reduce the frequency and severity of subsequent attacks.\n",

            "text": "Additional approaches that can be used in unusually severe cases or cases refractory to the preceding approaches are as follows:1.Topical NSAIDs (e.g., flurbiprofen 0.03%, 0.1% diclofenac, or another topical NSAID applied every 6 hours): These agents are not as potent as topical corticosteroids in ERU therapy, but in severe cases they may be used in addition to topical corticosteroids. Alternatively, they may be used long term, either alone or with topical corticosteroids in an effort to prevent recurrent episodes. Topical NSAIDs can slow corneal epithelialization.2.Cyclosporine A: Topical 0.2% cyclosporine ophthalmic ointment or 2% cyclosporine in oil applied every 6 to 12 hours has been suggested to be of value in the treatment of ERU. Because of the relatively limited intraocular penetration of this compound when applied topically, however, its efficacy appears to be somewhat less than that of topical corticosteroids. Experimentally, an intravitreal sustained-release insert containing cyclosporine has shown considerable promise in the treatment of ERU.3.Subconjunctival corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide): Reported dosages for triamcinolone acetonide vary greatly from 1 to 2 mg per eye, to 20 mg per eye, to 40 mg per eye as often as every 1 to 3 weeks. Usual duration of action is 7 to 10 days. The major concern with this drug is that it creates a strong predisposition for bacterial and fungal keratitis and that, unlike topically applied corticosteroids, it cannot be withdrawn if the disease should occur. Therefore it is typically used as an adjunct to topical corticosteroids in the acute phase in especially severe cases or when the owner has difficulty medicating the horse as often as required. Note: The sustained-release vehicle in methylprednisolone acetate may result in an unsightly plaque and irritating granuloma.4.Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 5 to 10 mg/day PO or 2.5 to 5.0 mg daily IM or oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg q24h): In general, because of frequent adverse effects, systemic corticosteroids are used only as a last resort in the treatment of ERU. They can be considered in unusually severe cases or when the inflammation is refractory to systemic NSAIDS and topical corticosteroids. Side effects include laminitis and gastrointestinal upset.5.Antibiotic therapy in horses with presumed leptospiral-associated uveitis: The efficacy of this therapy remains speculative, and side effects are not uncommon. Drugs that have been suggested include streptomycin (11 mg/kg IM q12h) and a 4-week course of oral doxycycline (10-20 mg/kg q12h). In one study by Gilmour et al., however, doxycycline at 10 mg/kg q12h orally did not result in appreciable drug concentrations in the aqueous humor or vitreous of normal eyes. Some researchers believe that the efficacy of vitrectomy for this disorder is due to the use of gentamicin in the irrigation fluid as much as the procedure itself. This theory has prompted some ophthalmologists to give a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg of gentamicin in an effort to prevent or eliminate recurrent episodes in severely affected eyes. Gentamicin injections, however, should be made with extreme caution because the drug may cause retinal degeneration, cataract formation, intraocular inflammation, endophthalmitis, and irreversible vision loss.6.Surgical vitrectomy via a pars plana approach has been advocated by some workers to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks of ERU. The rationale for its use is based on the hypothesis that persistent organisms within the vitreal cavity (and perhaps the uveal tract) are capable of perpetuating an immune-mediated uveitis. Controlled clinical trials have yet to demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure, and cataracts are a common postoperative complication.7.Vaccination is controversial. No approved vaccine is available for horses. The cross-reactivity of leptospiral antigens with normal constituents of the equine eye suggests that vaccination may actually cause the disease in some animals. Vaccination of seronegative horses with a multivalent bovine vaccine, with appropriate informed consent, may help suppress a herd outbreak. Vaccination as an adjunctive therapy in horses with ERU, however, failed to slow the progression of the disease in one study (Rohrbach et al., 2005).8.Enucleation is, on occasion, the only means of effectively treating a blind, painful globe.\n",
