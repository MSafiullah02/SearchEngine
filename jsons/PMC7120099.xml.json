An endophytic fungus lives in inter or intra cellular spaces in stem, petiole and leaves of a plant for a part or whole of their life cycle. Most endophytes isolated belong to ascomycetes and their anamorph basidiomycetes. The total biodiversity of fungal endophytes may be classified into two major categories. These include the clavicipitaceous (CE), which infect some grasses confined to cool regions and the non-clavicipitaceous endophytes (NCE), which are widely distributed and found in asymptomatic tissues of non vascular plants, conifers, ferns and angiosperms. However, NCE are reported to be restricted to Ascomycota and Basidicomycota groups (Jalgaonwala et al. 2011; Bhardwaj and Agrawal 2014). Symbiotic criteria used to characterize fungal endophytic classes are shown in Table 19.1.\n",

Gram positive and negative bacterial species majorly contribute to the diversity of bacterial endophytes viz., Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Bacillus\n, Brevibacterium, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas etc (Sun et al. 2013). These endophytes resides intracellularly in root and shoot cells of plants. In thisintracellular form bacteria loss cell wall but continue to divide and metabolize. These wall-less intracellular forms of bacteria are called L-forms (Allan et al. 2009). Actinomyces are prokaryotic organisms belonging to the phylum actinobacteria resembling mycelium like fungus and are spore producers (Chaudhary et al. 2013).",

In a greater view it is found that these endophytes not only enhance the tolerance of the plant, in biotic or abiotic stress helps but also improves the quality as well as the quantity of the secondary phytocompounds that are used as bioactive compounds or drugs (Jia et al. 2016). Due the development of sophisticated new versatile pseudo branches of life-sciences such as proteomics, genomics and their subdivided branches such as metabolomics, trancriptomics, it became much easier to determine molecular interaction at the most nano level (Rout and Sahoo 2013; Pervez et al. 2016; Abdurakhmonov 2016). On the basis of these advanced modes of evaluations it is found that the endophytic population may greatly be affected by the age of the plant, genetic variations in the plant, or environmental background of the host plant that lies in it (Jia et al. 2016). Taking the benefits into count, further bioengineer the endophyte with desired efficiency can be designed and incorporated into the host plant to produce the required quantity of the primary, secondary phytocompounds or drugs. Apart from the growth of the host plant, proper uptake of the nutrients by the host plant the disease resistance of the host plant against pathogen can also be improved (Mei and Flinn 2010).",

These colonizers are capable of establishing populations both inter- and intracellularly (Hurek et al. 1994; Zakria et al. 2007).

            "text": "Endophytes orchestrate many ubiquitous roles in the plant growth by colonizing the internal tissue in almost every part of the plant (Santoyo et al. 2016). Moreover, these endophytes could efficiently execute this spectacular attribution of plant growth enhancement via certain important interrelated mechanisms like phytostimulation, phytoimmobilization, phytostabilization, phytotransformation, phytovolatilization, phytofilterastion, biofertilization and biocontrol (Conesa et al. 2012). Phytostimulation is a direct manifestation of plant growth promotion through the up-regulation of phytohormones directly or indirectly (Bloemberg and Lugtenberg 2001). Likewise, phytoimmobilization is another remediation technology where contaminants are effectually removed by the means of plants, the intake and sequential release into the soil is further followed by immobilization in either a mineral-emended soil or a geomate commonly known as mineral-containingmat (Arthur et al. 2005). Removal of the contaminants from the location is quite sophisticated therefore stabilization provides another important and effective mode of technical amelioration strategy adapted by nature for self-sustenance (Perez-de-Mora et al. 2011). Together phytoimmobilization and phytostabilization leads to phytotransformation or otherwise known as phytodegradation (sequestration and/or compartmentalization) phytocompounds involve the transformation or deterioration of intricate organic molecules into unadorned or simple molecular form that could be further absorbed into plant tissue in necessary (Etim 2012). The efficient degradation of contaminants or the xenobiotics, the subsequent release is sometimes regarded as phytoextraction/phytovolatilization where they are efficiently removed out of the plant system into the atmosphere (Limmer and Burken 2016). Phytofiltration is a fascinating scheme tailored by the plants where, with the help of certain surface anchorage phytocompounds, contaminants or nutrients are either absorbed/bound to the nonliving part of the plant (biosorptation), or to the root (Rhizofiltration), or to the seedlings (Blastofiltration) (Conesa et al. 2012). Though there is tremendous advantage in the usage of this phenomenon for the agricultural remediation but till date the advancement of research in the field is scanty. Biofertilazation on the other hand is one of the most growing, demanding, advanced and widely researched area of agriculture and environmental science. It is a technique where living microorganisms effectively aggrandize the nutrients and mineral uptake of the plants by means of establishing a symbiotic relationship with the plant and simultaneously sustains the dynamic nature of the soil (Roychowdhury et al. 2017). And finally, the protection of plant from pathogens before or after the harvest by the help of endophytic microbes is another growing sector of agricultural research where the endophytes produce a bioactive compound or induces the host plant to produce a specific and/or a group of phytoactive compound that inhibits the growth and survivability of the pathogens (Eljounaidi et al. 2016; Shahzad et al. 2017).",

The most highly studied example of phytostimulation involves lowering plant hormone ethylene levels by 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate deaminase (ACC) . Several endophytesthat release ACC deaminase have been shown to increase plant growth including Arthrobacter spp. and Bacillus\nspp. in pepper plants (Capsicum annuum) as well as Pseudomonas putida and Rhodococcus spp. in peas (Pisum sativum) (Sziderics et al. 2007; Belimov et al. 2001). Higher amounts of bioactive GA3. GA4 and GA7 that induced maximum plant growth in rice and soyabean varieties by Cladosporium sphaerosperrmum, a fungal endophyte isolated from the roots of Glycine max (L) Merr (Humayun et al. 2009). Endophytes also facilitate uptake of important nutrients from soil, water and organic matter for growth and development of plants. Phyllobacterium brassicacearum and Bacillus\nsubtilis have been evaluated for enhancing the abscisic acid (ABA) in Arabidopsis thaliana and Platycladus orientalis respectively. The up-regulation ABA hormone resulted in decrement of leaf transpiration in A. thaliana while increment stomatal conductance in P. orientalis (Bresson et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2013). P. putida embellished the growth of Glycine max by inducing the secretion of the hormone gibberellins. In Lavandula dentate the hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was enhanced by B. thuringiensis, which further improved K-contents and proline with simultaneously decrease glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase (Armada et al. 2014). The production of IAA was also enhanced in Triticum by a group of microbes namely Rhizobium leguminosarum, R. phaseoli and Mesorhizobium ciceri (Hussain et al. 2014). In a different study a total of 377 bacterial endophytes were isolated form Vitis vinifera L cv. and were tested for plant growth promoting (PGP) abilities along with their effect of A. thaliana was also evaluated. It was found that the endophytes could able to promote ammonia production, phosphate solubilization, IAA and IAA-like molecules biosynthesis, siderophores and lytic enzyme secretion. Further twelve effective endophytes mainly belonging to Bacillus\n, Mirococcus and Pantoa genera were specifically selected for further studies (Baldan et al. 2015). Again 12 root endophytes from different strains of Solanum lycopersicum mostly belonging to species of Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Rhodococcus and Agrobacterium were isolated and analyzed for their PGP properties. Improvement in the production of organic acids, IAA,\nand\nsiderophores was observed. The impact was further verified on A. thaliana root growth using vertical agar plate assay (Abbamondi et al. 2016). In a most recent study, 101 endophytic bacteria were isolated from Simmondsia chinensis root of which 8 endophytic bacteria belonging to Bacillus\nsp., Streptomyces sp., Methylobacterium aminovorans, Rhodococcus pyridinivorans and Oceanobacillus kimchi were the partial sequencing of 16S rDNA gene. Later it was found that of these 8 endophytic bacterial species only two endophytes namely R. pyridinivorans and O. kimchi showed efficient PGP properties (Perez-Rosales et al. 2017).\n",

Their PGP ability was verified by their treatment with Waito-c rice seedling and moreover, their secondary metabolites such as bioactive gibberellins (GAs) and other inactive GAs were detected by HPLC and GC-MS SIM analysis (You et al. 2012). In Panax ginseng 38 strains of endophitic fungus belong to Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Engyodontium, Fusarium, Penicillium, Plectosphaerella, Verticillium and Ascomycete species were isolated and investigated for their capacity to produce saponins and ginsenosides which were detected by HPLC (Wu et al. 2013). Phoma species isolated from two medicinal plants namely Tinospora cordifolia and Calotropis procera was evaluated for its PGP activity on Zea mays, where it was observed that the fungus indeed showed the ability to promote the plant growth (Kedar et al. 2014). Trichoderma endophytes specifically T. atroviridae, T. polysporum and T. harzianum isolated from the roots of Phaseolus vulgaris could able to synthesize and release proteolytic enzymes and phosphate solubilization factors. Furthermore most of the active volatile and non-volatile metabolites that had certain stimulatory or inhibitory impact on P. vulgaris seed germination were perticularly released by T. polysporum and T. harzianum (Pierre et al. 2016). A recent study proves that IAA, ACC deaminase and solubilize phosphate secretion enhanced in the plant Brassica campestris by Mucor species which was identified by 18S and 28S rRNA ITS 1 and 4 sequence homology (Zahoor et al. 2017).",

Previously substantiation convey, bacterial endophytes as an effective tool that could be implemented in regulation of physiological changes including immobilization of osmolytes, certain micronutrients along with osmotic acclimatization, stabilization of membrane ion conductivity which is directly or indirectly linked with changes in the membrane phospholipid composition (Compant et al. 2005). Phytoimmobilization and transformation ultimately leads to increased ability to sustain or tolerate the stress induced by the abiotic component or factor. Plants like Elsholtzia splendens and Commelina communis which could tolerate or withstand copper concentration, have been reported to encounter an increase in dry weight of the root as well as the shoot when inoculated with endophytic bacteria in comparison to the control (Sun et al. 2010). On the other hand endophytes that are genetically modified convey an additional channel for phyto-associated neutralization of the contaminants and there by ameliorating the stress induced by these contaminants in the site (Divya and Kumar 2011). On the basis 16S rRNA gene sequencing phylogenic analysis reveled of about 118 isolates comprising of 17 proteobacterial genera in the chromium treated plant sample of Albizia lebbeck. The proteobacterial genera commonly comprised of Bacillus\n, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Salinococcus and Marinomonas (Manikandan et al. 2015). There are certain multi-metal resistance endophytes, one of such endophyte is Achromobacter piechaudii a bacterium isolated from Sedum plumbizincicola and characterized by morphological features, biochemical and 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenic analysis. The bacterial strain portrayed increased level of resistance to cadmium, zinc and lead along with other salutary properties such as solubilization of phosphors and production of IAA and lastly presence of the strain significantly increased the availability of cadmium, zinc and lead in soil (Ma et al. 2016). Effective bioremediation can be generally achieved by constructed wetland vegetated with Leptochloa fusca. It was found that, when a combination of three endophytic bacteria namely Pantoea stewartii, Microbacterium arborescens and Enterobacter species used for bioaugmentation, the consortium of the bacteria could enhance the growth of L. fusca and simultaneously contributed to the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants and also ameliorated the toxicity in the constructed wetland (Ashraf et al. 2017).",

Currently studies are focused on evaluating the capacity of endophytic fungus to induce metal tolerance and partial immobilization in plants. One such example can be cited for the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium that enhanced cadmium tolerance and its partial immobilization in infected plants named Festuca arundinacea and F. pratensis. Additionally it was observed that photochemical efficacy of photosystem II increased, indicating the reduction of cadmium stress (Soleimani et al. 2010a, b). Species of Exophiala, Metarhizium, Promicromonospora and Pencillium also showed increased tolerance to metal stress of copper and cadmium. But it was Pencillium funiculosum that highly ameliorated biomass yield, chlorophyll and total protein contents in its host plant Glycine max L. under Cu stress (Khan and Lee 2013). Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus (AMF) is a group of mycorrhizal fungus that could penetrate roots through cortical cells of the vascular plants. In Triticum the grain and shoot yield was increased under different concentration of Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn when inoculated with AMF compared to un-inoculated Triticum (Khan et al. 2014). Dark Septate Endophytes (DSEs) are asexual chlamydospores ascomycetous fungi that inhabits within the living plant root in a symbiotic relationship. One of such endophyte is Exophiala pisciphila, which regulates physiological response in Z. mays under soil cadmium stress. The mechanism is not clear how such tolerance is achieved by Z. mays by the help DSE (Wang et al. 2016). The immobilization of soluble arsenic is another interesting feature displayed by these endophytic fungus. Piriformospora indica is one of such fungus the colony of which was isolated from Oryza sativa root and was evaluated for its impact on the plant. Primarily it was found that hyper-colonization of the fungus that ultimately alleviated biomass density, root amelioration, number of chlorophyll and stabilization of oxidoredox status by the modulation of the antioxidative enzyme system which finally protects the plants photo-system under stress induced due to hyper-concentration of arsenic (Mohd et al. 2017). The impact of endophytes that enhances plant growth by phytoimmobilization is shown in Table 19.4.",

The fungal pathogen \nBotrytis cinerea causes severe rotting in tomatoes during storage and shelf life can be well antogonised by endophytic bacteria\nBacillus\nsubtilis isolated from Spaeranskiatuberculata (Bge.) Baill (Wang et al. 2009). A new strain of Burkholderia pyrrocinia and B. cepacia, were identified as potential biocontrol agent against poplar canker (Ren et al. 2011).\nBioactive compounds from endophytes and their use against pathogenic micro-organisms is shown in Table 19.5.\n",
