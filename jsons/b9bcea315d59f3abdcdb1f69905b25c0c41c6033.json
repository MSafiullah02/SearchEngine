Healthcare providers are at increased risks of infection when caring for patients with COVID-19. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. However, there is growing evidence for airborne spread, in addition to direct droplet and indirect contact. Here, we report on the design, construction, and testing of the BADGER (Box for Aerosol and Droplet Guarding and Evacuation in Respiratory Infection), an affordable, scalable device that contains droplets and aerosol particles. A semi-sealed environment is created inside the BADGER, which maintains at least twelve-air changes per hour using in-wall vacuum suction, and multiple hand-ports enable healthcare providers to perform essential tasks on a patient's airway and head. Overall, the BADGER has the potential to contain large droplets and small airborne particles as demonstrated by simulated qualitative and quantitative assessments to provide an additional layer of protection for healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients.",

Most particles generated during coughing and sneezing are between 0.35 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m.12 Direct droplet spread occurs when droplets from a patient's respiratory tract land on a recipient's mucosal surface. Indirect droplet spread happens via direct physical interaction with of an infected person, or of the surfaces and fomites that have contacted with the infected person or their droplets. 13 On the other hand, airborne transmission occurs when aerosolized particles are inhaled into the lower airway. Although it is often stated that droplets with a diameter (dp) > 5 \u03bcm can deposit directly on nearby surfaces while smaller aerosol particles (dp < 5 \u03bcm) remain in the air for significantly longer periods of time, the distance a particle travels is complex and dependent on many dynamic variables such as particle size, shape, charge, flow velocities, composition, density, air turbulence, temperature, and humidity. [14] [15] [16] Patients with respiratory infections often generate large amounts of aerosols from coughing, sneezing, or heavy breathing. 17 ",

In order to contain smaller diameter airborne particles, a negative pressure and/or rapid air exchange rate is needed, similar to the function of a negative-pressure room. To achieve our goal of keeping the device affordable and easy to manufacture, we used commonly available materials, clinical equipment and supplies. After three prototypes, we reached a production version. The BADGER is constructed of a clear reusable shell and disposable accessories and, when assembled, creates a closed chamber. The shell of the BADGER is a tapered pentagonal box that has a height of 50cm, a torsoopening of 60cm, and overall volume of 95.8 liters (L) (Figure 2 ). There are 4 hand-ports for health care providers and assistants, and two 22mm diameter openings for two viral high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters placement. The side panels are constructed by bending, or by cutting into separate panels ( Figure 2B) . The top panel is glued to the side panels using a hot melt adhesive ( Figure   2C ). To create a semi-sealed chamber, all the openings need to be closed off. For the hand-ports, we used the sleeve-ring method by assembling large disposable surgical gloves on 3D custom-made printed grommets ( Figure 2D ). The glove fingers can be trimmed off at the palm to create a sleeve. While this compromises the seal at the hand-ports, it allows greater mobility, reach, and reduces wrong-handedness. The sleeve-rings are then inserted into the hand-ports of the BADGER (Figure 3) . The large interior opening for the torso is sealed off from the outside environment using two overlapping plastic drapes. Large diameter tubing such as ventilator tubing is used to evacuate air from the box after passing through the HEPA filters.",

To compare the efficacy of the BADGER without seal and suction, nebulized Bitrex or saline were introduced while the drapes were lifted up and no suction was applied.

Room air was sampled through the filter at multiple flow rates in order to determine the flow rate when particle breakthrough occurred for the filter.

In the first scenario, the mannequin was receiving 10 L/min of oxygen via a facemask. As smoke was introduced into the BADGER in the standard operating configuration without suction applied to the BADGER, there was visual leakage of smoke from under the drapes and from the hand-ports (Figure 4C) . When suction was applied at medium strength (100 mmHg) to create an outflow rate of approximately 39 L/min, smoke was well contained inside the BADGER. When simulated coughs were performed by suddenly compressing the mannequin's lungs, the BADGER was able to contain smoke inside its chamber ( Figure 4D ). Five minutes after cessation of smoke generation, the BADGER was able to clear the visible smoke inside. Sub-micrometer aerosol particle containment test: Results from a typical particle containment test (outflow rate of 13 L/min with filters) are shown in Figure 5B , where sub-micrometer particle concentrations were measured in both the BADGER (red circles) and the exterior enclosure (black circles). Particle concentrations in the BADGER approach steady-state following approximately 15 minutes, peaking at 1 \u00d7 104 particles/cm3, while particle concentrations in the outer enclosure peak at < 500 particles/cm3. To determine the fraction of particles contained by the BADGER, we model the time dependent particle concentrations in each box, constrained by the measured flow rates into and out of each enclosure and the time dependent change in particle concentrations during a typical experiment. We utilize both the steady-state concentrations and the rise and fall times in both enclosures to determine the leak rate of particles from the BADGER to the outer enclosure and the particle .

Moreover, there is evidence that current PPE might not provide adequate protection against infectious airborne particles.30 Given the rapidly evolving situation, proof-of-principle devices have emerged to provide organizations with possible designs for combating the imminent challenges they are facing. Several physical barrier designs to protect healthcare providers during aerosol-generating activities have been developed. However, these devices largely limit protection to direct contact with larger droplets and lack proven efficacy.21 The use of negative-pressure isolation rooms is important to ensure infectious agents do not spread through the surrounding environment.",

In this study, the aerosol dispersion test was conducted at lower outflow rate (13 L/min) compared with the recommended minimum outflow rate of 19.2 L/min.

The BADGER is designed to contain and evacuate aerosol particles at minimal outflow rate of twelve air changes of exhaust per hour. This will be particularly useful during aerosol-generating activities and procedures in compliant patients who can lie in the BADGER to reduce the risk of aerosol dispersion and transmission of respiratory infective particles to healthcare professionals and workers. As a result, institutional approval for clinical use has been granted by the University of Wisconsin Health during this pandemic. We have used the BADGER in the perioperative period with the consent of patients and their families (Figure 3D-E) . The box was appropriately positioned prior to induction of anesthesia, and direct laryngoscopy was performed on all cases. There were no complications and endotracheal positioning and intubation were confirmed by capnography. The BADGER remained in place for the duration of all the cases. At the end of the operations, the patients were extubated inside the BADGER and had uneventful post-operative courses. As there is more evidence of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 from innocuous activities such as sneezing and coughing, and current standard PPE might not fully prevent exposure for healthcare providers, the BADGER might be an additional layer of protection to mitigate airborne transmission of 30, 32 There are several limitations of this study and of the BADGER. It is foreseeable that in situations involving a difficult or obstructed airway, the device could limit access to the patient. In this scenario, the device could be easily lifted up and removed to restore complete exposure. The clear polycarbonate material allows for easy visualization of the patient's airway by the anesthesia provider, and intubation could be performed by either direct laryngoscopy or videolaryngoscopy. However, the BADGER can still make procedures more difficult in critical situations. We recommend standardized, simulated training for those who will use this device before implementing in a clinical setting. We found that most users became very comfortable after 2-3 hand-on practices.",

We have not extensively tested the BADGER using all tubing sizes and filter configurations at different vacuum levels. Although ideal outflow rate Q for laminar, isothermal, non-compressible gas can be estimated based on the Hagen-Poiseuille equation: = 4 ( 1 \u2212 2 ) 128\u00b5 ,26 where D is the inner diameter of the tube, P1 is atmospheric pressure, P2 is vacuum pressure, L is total length of tubing and \u00b5 is dynamic viscosity of air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (1.81 x 10-5 Pa.s), we expected and confirmed that actual outflow rates are much lower. This is due to very high Reynolds number for high air flow rate indicating non-laminar flow and increases in Mach number at higher pressures due to compressible air. 26 While the BADGER provides a relative negative pressure analogous to a negative pressure room, the negative pressure is minimal, and these results are preliminary and purely in simulated environments. It is possible that the fraction of sub-micrometer particles contained during aerosol-generating activities and procedures (e.g., sneezing, intubation) may decrease as there is a sudden pressure increase inside the BADGER or as it becomes less well-sealed. Further testing must be performed to determine aerosol containment and clearance in more clinically relevant scenarios, both simulated and real clinical settings. In the meantime, healthcare providers should maintain appropriate respiratory PPE usage according to their institutional protocols. Furthermore, it is possible that CO2 levels in the BADGER could rise when a patient is inside. Since data on CO2 emission rate from a person inside the BADGER are not available, we recommend maintaining adequate outflow rate and frequent monitoring of the patient's condition to avoid possible negative outcomes.",
