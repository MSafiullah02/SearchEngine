            "text": "\nMice (Mus musculus), rats (Rattus norvegicus), other rodent species, and domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been used in research for over 100 years. During the first half of the 20th century, microbiological quality control (QC) of lab animals was at best rudimentary as colonies were conventionally housed and little or no diagnostic testing was done. Hence, animal studies were often curtailed and confounded by infectious disease (Mobraaten and Sharp, 1999, Morse, 2007, Weisbroth, 1999). By the 1950s, it became apparent to veterinarians in the nascent field of comparative medicine that disease-free animals suitable for research could not be produced by standard veterinary disease control measures (e.g., improved sanitation and nutrition, antimicrobial treatments) in conventional facilities. Henry Foster, the veterinarian who founded Charles River Breeding Laboratories in 1948 and a pioneer in the large-scale production of laboratory rodents, stated in a seminar presented at the 30th anniversary of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science, \u201cAfter a variety of frustrating health-related problems, it was decided that a major change in the company\u2019s philosophy was required and an entirely different approach was essential.\u201d Consequently, he and others developed innovative biosecurity systems to eliminate and exclude pathogens (Allen, 1999). In 1958, Foster reported on the Cesarean-originated barrier-sustained (COBS) process for the large-scale production of specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory rodents (Foster, 1958). To eliminate horizontally transmitted pathogens, a hysterectomy was performed on a near-term dam from a contaminated or conventionally housed colony. The gravid uterus was pulled through a disinfectant solution into a sterile flexible film isolator where the pups were removed from the uterus and suckled on axenic (i.e., germ-free) foster dams. After being mated to expand their number and associated with a cocktail of nonpathogenic bacteria to normalize their physiology and prime their immune system, rederived rodents were transferred to so-called barrier rooms for large-scale production. The room-level barrier to adventitious infection entailed disinfection of the room, equipment and supplies, limiting access to trained and properly gowned personnel, and the application of new technologies such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration of incoming air (Dubos and Schaedler, 1960, Foster, 1980, Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983, Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). The axenic and associated rodents mentioned in the COBS process are collectively classified as gnotobiotic to indicate that they have a completely known microflora. By contrast, barrier-reared rodent colonies are not gnotobiotic because they are housed in uncovered cages and thus acquire a complex microflora from the environment, supplies, personnel, and other sources. Instead, they are described as SPF to indicate that according to laboratory testing, they are free from infection with a defined list of infectious agents, commonly known as an \u2018exclusion\u2019 list.",

            "text": "The advances in cell biology, genetics, and analytical methods that coincided with the progress in research animal biosecurity led to discoveries of infections, often by viruses, which although inapparent nonetheless confounded experimental findings by contaminating biological reagents and distorting or modulating in vivo and in vitro responses dependent on infected host cells (Hartley and Rowe, 1960, Kilham and Olivier, 1959, Riley et al., 1960, Rowe et al., 1962). There are also documented cases of unrecognized infections altering the phenotype of animal models as has been reported for infections with Helicobacter spp. (Horowitz et al., 2007, Jurjus et al., 2004, Kuhn et al., 1993, Kullberg et al., 1998, Mombaerts et al., 1993, Powrie and Leach, 1995, Strober and Ehrhardt, 1993). In addition, mice and rats were shown to be the reservoir species for zoonotic viruses responsible for disease outbreaks in laboratory personnel exposed to silently infected cell lines or cell line-inoculated rodents (Baum et al., 1966, Bhatt et al., 1986a, Himan, 1975, Lewis et al., 1965, Lloyd and Jones, 1986). Thus, the absence of overt disease was no longer sufficient evidence that animals were either suitable or safe for research. Rather, routine laboratory screening, commonly referred to as health monitoring (HM), was required to detect inapparent infections capable of interfering with research. The traditional HM methodologies used for over half a century have included direct gross and microscopic examinations of animal specimens for parasites and pathology, microbiology consisting of cultural isolation, and phenotypic identification of primary and opportunistically pathogenic bacteria and fungi, and serology, that is, immunoassays of serum or blood samples for specific antibodies formed in response to infections with viruses and several fastidious and invasive microbial pathogens. The newest methodology, molecular diagnostics by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was introduced in general and to lab animal diagnostics in the mid-1990s; since then, its use in HM has grown, in recent years dramatically, for reasons that will be discussed later (Compton and Riley, 2001, Compton et al., 1995, Lipman and Homberger, 2003, Livingston and Riley, 2003, Shek and Gaertner, 2002, Weisbroth et al., 1998).",

Moreover, it was apparent that many research establishments were not prepared to maintain the SPF status of commercial rodents, which often became ill or seropositive shortly after being received. Subsequently, major commercial breeders greatly reduced the incidence of barrier room contaminations by more thorough disinfection of rooms prior to stocking, rigorous adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs), and validation and routine certification of the procedures and equipment for disinfecting supplies. They also discontinued direct room-to-room transfers based on negative HM results, as this practice surely contributed to the inadvertent dissemination of unrecognized pathogens such as the then-novel rodent parvovirus serotypes (Ball-Goodrich and Johnson, 1994, Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998, Besselsen et al., 1995a, Besselsen et al., 1996, Jacoby et al., 1995, Mckisic et al., 1993, Smith et al., 1993a) and entero\u00adhepatic species of Helicobacter (Fox et al., 1994, Fox et al., 1996, Ward et al., 1994b) identified in the 1990s, and murine norovirus (MNV) first reported in 2003 (Henderson, 2008, Hsu et al., 2006, Karst et al., 2003, Ward et al., 2006). At research institutions, the incidence and prevalence of adventitious infections \u2013 where incidence indicates the rate of new contaminations, or outbreaks (e.g., 10 mouse parvovirus (MPV) contaminations/1000 racks/year), and prevalence is the % positive within a time period (e.g., 40% of mice in North America were MNV seropositive in 2012) \u2013 were greatly reduced by switching from housing rodents in uncovered cages, perhaps in barrier rooms, to static and then individually ventilated microisolation cage-level barrier systems shown to be highly effective at excluding and impeding the transmission of adventitious agents (Bohr et al., 2006, Hessler, 1999, Lipman, 1999, Sedlacek and Mason, 1977).",

Additionally, transgenic and gene-targeted genetically engineered mouse models for human diseases, which make up a large and rapidly growing proportion of the animals used in research, have been shown often to harbor pathogens such as Helicobacter spp., MNV, Pasteurella pneumotropica, and parasites largely eliminated from commercial colonies (Carty, 2008, Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009). Likely reasons for this include the recurrent and expanding exchange of genetically engineered mice among research institutions worldwide where QC practices vary and infected rodents may be housed and the initially inadvertent distribution of mice infected with Helicobacter spp. and MNV before these agents were recognized and testing for them was available. Thus, genetically engineered mice represent a significant source of adventitious agents capable of confounding experiments, not least of all in genetically engineered models in which these infections have been shown to alter or obscure the effects of genetic modifications, or cause severe and sometimes atypical disease (Compton et al., 2003, Franklin, 2006).",

It is worth noting that this is comparable to the complementary approaches of strict control of production processes and comprehensive quality testing, which are the basis of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) for regulated pharmaceuticals (Tolbert and Rupp, 1989). While the degree of rigor engendered in CGMPs of regulated pharmaceuticals may be excessive for laboratory research, applying the essential aspects of CGMPs to microbiological QC of research animals and biological reagents is a prerequisite for meaningful biomedical research. Insufficient microbiological QC during research can lead to inaccurate findings, the need to repeat experiments, and biological product development setbacks and failures.",

The term \u2018principals\u2019 (or principal animals) refers to the animal populations, or groups, being monitored, whether resident or in quarantine. Residents include colony and study animals housed at a facility. Collecting specimens from microisolation caging systems that are representative of the principals\u2019 pathogen status and suitable for the test method is challenging because of the often low prevalence of infection and the shortcomings of soiled bedding sentinel monitoring. PCR testing of non-invasive specimens collected directly from resident and quarantined animals, and of environmental samples not suitable for traditional methodologies is helping address these challenges (Bauer and Riley, 2006, Compton et al., 2004c, Henderson et al., 2013, Jensen et al., 2013, Macy et al., 2009, Macy et al., 2011). The process of containing and eradicating adventitious infections is inevitably costly and disruptive to research. Therefore, it is crucial that repeat testing, employing complementary methodologies if possible, be carried out to verify infection of the resident animals before taking remedial measures. Once the occurrence of an adventitious infection has been verified, actions are taken to contain, eradicate, and investigate the contamination with the goal of preventing a recurrence.",

            "text": "Exclusion lists for rodents, rabbits, and other common lab animal species have been substantially harmonized throughout the developed world due to the efforts of lab animal science organizations (Guillen, 2012, Nicklas, 2008, Nicklas et al., 2002), and the globalization of biomedical research. In addition, competition for customers encourages vendors to offer SPF animals free of newly discovered pathogens and diagnostic laboratories to develop tests for those pathogens (Shek, 2000). The exclusion lists for SPF mice and rats are more extensive than those for rabbits and other common lab animal species for a number of reasons. First, as mice and rats account for the vast majority of animals used in research, it stands to reason that more is known about their indi\u00adgenous pathogens than those of other less used lab animal species. The diversity of inbred, and naturally and genetically engineered immunodeficient mutant rodent strains highly susceptible to infectious disease (Compton et al., 2003, Franklin, 2006), in conjunction with sensitive immunoassay methods (Smith, 1986b) and advances in molecular genetics (Compton and Riley, 2001), has contributed to the discovery and characterization of rodent pathogens (Fox et al., 1994, Ward et al., 1994a) found to be the cause of ubiquitous, inapparent infections of laboratory rodent colonies (Hsu et al., 2006, Shames et al., 1995). In addition, the predominance of murine rodent research models has provided strong incentives for diagnostic laboratories and vendors to develop and offer specific serologic and PCR assays for viral and other fastidious microbial pathogens \u2013 not amenable to detection by direct microscopic examination or cultural isolation \u2013 soon after their discovery. By contrast, commercial vendors and diagnostic laboratories have had little demand from the research and lab animal medicine communities to provide routine serologic and PCR testing for rabbit viruses recognized decades ago, such as lapine parvovirus (Matsunaga and Matsuno, 1983) (which sequencing has recently shown to be a bocavirus (personal communication, K Henderson)), rabbit enteric coronavirus (Deeb et al., 1993, Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990, Descoteaux et al., 1985), and leporid herpesvirus 2 (Matsunaga and Yamazaki, 1976). Finally, rederivation by hysterectomy or embryo transfer (ET) to eliminate all exogenous pathogens is the standard practice for SPF mice and rats, but not for other species.",

Strict adherence to the dogma of excluding all exogenous viruses from SPF mice and rats, however, has become impractical at many research institutions where asymptomatic MNV infections, primarily in genetically engineered mice, are considered to be too widespread to be eliminated. Leading-edge molecular genetic techniques have recently uncovered a murine astrovirus (Farkas et al., 2012), possibly more common in mice than MNV, and will surely find additional prevalent viruses that have so far eluded detection because they, like MPV, MNV, and murine astrovirus, are highly host-adapted and by and large apathogenic even for immunodeficient hosts. As noted, viral exclusion lists for rabbits and other lab animal species are less comprehensive than for murine rodents.",

Pathogenicity is not necessarily an immutable characteristic of the microbial species as normally commensal microbes such as Escherichia coli have been transformed into pathogens through the acquisition of virulence genes transferred from other bacteria in mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, phages, and transposons (Dobrindt et al., 2004).",

Opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pneumocystis fungi cause disease mainly in immunocompromised hosts, whether (1) immunosuppressed by irradiation or chemotherapy (Bosma et al., 1983, Cryz et al., 1983, Flynn, 1963, Homberger et al., 1993, Rosen and Berk, 1977, Waggie et al., 1988, Walzer et al., 1989, Weir et al., 1986, Weisbroth et al., 1999) or (2) inherently immunodeficient, such as athymic nude and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Bosma et al., 1983, Clifford et al., 1995, Dole et al., 2013b, Henderson et al., 2012, Pantelouris, 1968, Ward et al., 1996). For the most part, only primary microbial pathogens are included in SPF exclusion lists for immunocompetent animals. Opportunists are added, chiefly by commercial vendors, to lists for immunodeficient and genetically engineered mutant lines. Because it is not unusual for opportunists such as S. aureus to cause disease in standard (i.e., nongenetically engineered) immunocompetent strains of rodents (Besch-Williford and Franklin, 2007), which are often used in rederivation and breeding schemes for genetically engineered lines, the demand for standard, immunocompetent rodent strains and stocks free of opportunistic as well as primary pathogens has increased.

In general, the SPF exclusion lists of mice and rats are more comprehensive than those of less popular animal species because more of the indigenous murine viral and host-adapted microbial pathogens have been identified and studied; serologic and PCR assays are made available for murine pathogens soon after their discovery; and rederivation to eliminate all exogenous pathogens from SPF mouse and rat populations is standard practice. The SPF exclusion lists of all species typically contain ectoparasites, endoparasites, and microbes classified as primary pathogens as well as viruses; vendors often add opportunistic pathogens for immunodeficient and genetically engineered mutant murine models.",

Many research-intensive academic institutions have decided that the benefits of eliminating prevalent infections with recently recognized agents such as MNV and Helicobacter, which rarely produce disease and/or have been endemic to their research colonies for many years, are outweighed by the disruption to research and costs of doing so. However, the elimination (and exclusion) of prevalent pathogens and compliance with consensus SPF standards reduces the risk that a pathogen will infect additional colonies and interfere with research, and simplifies the exchange of animal models and collaborative studies with other investigators and institutions.",

            "text": "Rederivation of SPF lab animal stocks from those that are harboring pathogens is widely regarded as the most dependable approach for eliminating infections with unrecognized as well as known pathogens. In association with advances in assisted reproductive technologies, ET into SPF pseudopregnant recipient females has supplanted nursing of Cesarian section-originated pups by gnotobiotic or SPF foster mothers as the gold standard for rederivation (Suzuki et al., 1996, Van Keuren and Saunders, 2004). Cesarean rederivation is considered to be less reliable than ET because vertical transmission of infections to fetuses has been demonstrated for viruses (Barthold et al., 1988, Jacoby et al., 2001, Katami et al., 1978, Lehmann-Grube, 1982) and for bacteria capable of colonizing the uterus (Brown and Steiner, 1996, Matsumiya and Lavoie, 2003, Reyes et al., 2000, Reyes et al., 2004, Ward et al., 1978). Vertical transmission by ET is unlikely because the zona pellucida that surrounds embryos and oocytes excludes pathogens (Peters et al., 2006) and the risk of infecting the recipient females is minimized by extensive washing of the embryos. In a recent study, ET from MPV-infected SCID mice eliminated the infection (Besselsen et al., 2008b). Other advantages of ET vis-\u00e0-vis Cesarean rederivation are that it can be combined with other artificial methods like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) to overcome the reproductive defects that are common in aged and in naturally and genetically engineered mutant mice (Suzuki et al., 1996). Embryos, ova, and sperm (i.e., germplasm) can be cryopreserved to reduce per diem costs, save valuable cage space, and assure that unique genetically engineered strains can be rederived at any time and, hence, are never lost. Finally, ET is more efficient because embryo donors are usually superovulated resulting in more offspring per female than are obtained from natural matings (Mazur et al., 2008).",

For mice and rats, this has been accomplished over many years by overcoming various technical hurdles such as (1) hand rearing and meeting the unique nutritional needs of germfree animals; (2) development of defined cocktails of non-pathogenic bacteria to colonize the intestinal tract of ex-germfree animals in order to resist colonization by pathogenic microbes, to normalize host physiology, and to stimulate the immune system; and (3) maintaining rodents in isolators or microisolation cages on sterile supplies to exclude all exogenous microbes from axenic and defined flora animals (Foster, 1980, Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983, Trexler, 1983, Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). The production of defined flora pathogen-free animals is uncommon for other lab animal species but has been described for rabbits (Boot et al., 1985, Boot et al., 1989b, Yanabe et al., 1999) and guinea pigs (Boot et al., 1989a). Cross-fostering offspring onto SPF animals of a different species has been attempted when SPF animals of the same species are not available. In a successful example, H. hepaticus was eliminated from Mongolian gerbils by Cesarean rederivation with cross-fostering of the offspring onto SPF mice and rats. The percent survival of rederived gerbils was higher for those nursed by mice (Glage et al., 2007).",

The most effective and frequently administered antiparasite medications are the avermectins (e.g., ivermectin and selamectin) and benzimidazoles (e.g., fendbendazole); they are normally added to the diet or drinking water, or applied topically (Pritchett and Johnston, 2002, Ricart Arbona et al., 2010b). Therapeutic doses of these drugs, however, may cause toxicity as has been demonstrated for ivermectin given to rodents with compromised blood\u2013brain barriers because of young age (Lankas et al., 1989, Skopets et al., 1996), genetic background (Jackson et al., 1998, Lankas et al., 1997), or genetically engineered mutations (Schinkel et al., 1994, Schinkel et al., 1997). Antibiotic treatments have been shown to eliminate infections with host-adapted bacterial pathogens, such as P. pneumotropica (Goelz et al., 1996, Matsumiya and Lavoie, 2003) and H. hepaticus (Foltz et al., 1996, Kerton and Warden, 2006, Russell et al., 1995), which do not survive for long ex vivo and, therefore, are unlikely to reinfect hosts after treatment is stopped. Even when effective, however, drug therapies may be too expensive or laborious to be practical, particularly when treating large numbers of animals. However, the labor and cost of large-scale chemotherapy have been greatly reduced by using commercially available medicated diets for treating parasite infestations (Ricart Arbona et al., 2010b) and Helicobacter infections (Kerton and Warden, 2006, Whary and Fox, 2006).",

            "text": "Another alternative to rederivation applied historically to nonpersistent infections of immunocompetent hosts with enveloped viruses (e.g., Sendai virus and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV)) is to break the cycle of infection by instituting a 6- to 8-week moratorium on breeding and the introduction of naive animals (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985). During this period, it was expected that all animals in the colony would recover from infection and stop shedding virus, and that the excreted virus would quickly become noninfectious due to the environmental lability of these agents. Historical success was enhanced by the small size of the affected population, and contemporary mouse housing rooms are likely to contain 700\u2013800 cages. A time-efficient alternative to a breeding moratorium is to start a new colony with seropositive, noncontagious breeders (Brammer et al., 1993). It is worth emphasizing that breaking the cycle of infection, commonly called \u2018burnout\u2019, is not recommended in contemporary rodent colonies due to the increasing proportion of genetically modified rodents in populations and the frequently unknown immune competence and atypical response to infection of such animals. The relevance of burnout has been further eroded by the virtual disappearance from research colonies of infections with enveloped respiratory viruses to which this approach was applicable. Most of the enteric viruses that continue to be present in research colonies today are nonenveloped and hence environmentally stable, and persist for prolonged or indefinite periods in the tissues of hosts, including those that are immunocompetent and seropositive. MNV, the most prevalent pathogen of mice, is shed indefinitely (Hsu et al., 2006, Manuel et al., 2008). If despite these caveats breaking the cycle of infection is attempted, confirmation of eradication is best achieved by PCR or by serosurveillance of sentinels instead of the colony offspring that will likely have maternal antibodies.",

            "text": "Although the effectiveness of filter-covered cages for excluding and controlling the spread of infections had already been demonstrated for mouse rotavirus in1958 (Kraft, 1958), this cage-level barrier strategy did not become popular until the 1980s when commercial microisolation caging systems were introduced. The first microisolation cages were referred to as \u2018static\u2019 to indicate that they relied on passive ventilation. As the temperatures, humidity levels, and noxious gas concentrations (such as CO2 and NH3) in static cages were found to be significantly elevated in comparison with room levels, actively ventilated microisolation caging systems were developed to enhance the cage microenvironment (Les, 1983) and to allow for higher animal densities with fewer cage changes. Moreover, ventilated systems can be exhausted directly into the facility HVAC to improve the room environment and can be run under a negative pressure differential for pathogen containment. To maximize biosecurity, microisolation cages should only be opened in a HEPA-filtered air laminar flow change stations or biological safety cabinets by technicians wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and following sterile technique when manipulating animals. Microisolation cages are often located in barrier rooms to provide a further obstacle to microbial contamination (Hessler, 1999, Lipman, 1999, Sedlacek and Mason, 1977, Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). Today, microisolation caging systems house the majority of rodents at research-intensive academic, biotechnical, and pharmaceutical institutions. There is little doubt that the effectiveness of these cage-level barrier systems at excluding and impeding the spread of infections, and their tolerance of systemic deficiencies and operator errors, has played a major part in lowering the frequency of microbial contaminations at biomedical research facilities and keeping the prevalence of infection low following an outbreak (Macy et al., 2011, Shek, 2008, Whary et al., 2000a). The challenges that this low prevalence presents to obtaining test results that accurately represent the pathogen status of principal animals (i.e., the resident colony or study animals, or the quarantined animals being monitored) will be discussed in Section IV.",

            "text": "As mentioned, the most likely animal reservoir of infection for SPF rodent colonies are other rodents, whether wild or feral (i.e., escaped), housed nearby in the same facility, or imported. Wild rodents have been shown to carry a variety of pathogens that contaminate SPF facilities (Behnke, 1975, Bhatt et al., 1986b, Chabe et al., 2010, Childs et al., 1989, Ike et al., 2007, Parker et al., 2009, Singleton et al., 1993, Skinner et al., 1977, Smith et al., 1993b). The risk of their contaminating an SPF colony is expected to increase when a rodent control program is not in place or the structural barriers to entry are inadequate (Lussier et al., 1988). Pest control services are best provided by a reputable and licensed commercial vendor. Animal facilities should be constructed and maintained so that potential nest areas and routes of ingress or egress are not present. All holes and cracks in the facility should be sealed. No matter how careful the oversight of construction projects, there may be unanticipated problems. A relatively new housing facility very suddenly revealed evidence of increased wild/feral mouse activity. Doors that were to be completely sealed were found to have small holes on the bottom surface and mice were breeding in the Styrofoam filler that was used in the doors for noise abatement (A.L. Smith, unpublished). A widespread fur mite outbreak in that vivarium about 1 year later was attributed to the earlier mouse infestation and necessitated treatment of all mice in the facility at a cost of $102,000. Trapping devices should be used to detect and eliminate loose rodents. Those that are captured alive should be identified as to species, handled as if they were infected, anesthetized, bled for serology, and examined for internal and external parasites prior to euthanasia. Whether loose rodents are captured dead or alive, specimens from them (e.g., tissues, feces, and swabs) are suitable for testing by microbial PCR as an adjunct or alternative to traditional diagnostic methodologies. Food, bedding, and garbage attract loose rodents and therefore should be stored off the floor in a secure area in sealed containers (Hoddenbach et al., 1997; Small, 1983). Vivaria that are located in multiuse buildings, frequently including offices and common areas at academic institutions, are at high risk because food is often present and may not be cleared until the next day after late social events. Sealed trash containers should be used in these situations to decrease the likelihood of rodents having access to food.",

By contrast, the risk of unexpectedly introducing pathogens with rodents and rabbits from large commercial breeders is minimal. Commercial vendors that have historically low rates of contamination, transportation dedicated to SPF animals, and a track record of reliability are usually put on an institution\u2019s \u2018approved vendors list\u2019, which exempts their animals from quarantine. At large, research-intensive academic institutions, the vast majority of rodents acquired by scientists are likely to be procured from \u2018approved\u2019 commercial vendors. However, while the absolute number of animals is much smaller, these same scientists frequently need to procure unique strains of rodents from colleagues at academic institutions or biotech or pharmaceutical companies. These are so-called nonapproved vendors and most institutions have policies and programs that provide quality control testing of these animals prior to their release into the general resident population. Among the steps taken to mitigate risks associated with importing these rodents are (1) review of health reports from the source colony (often 1 year\u2019s worth of data may be requested) to ensure the animals are not likely to carry an agent excluded by the recipient institution; (2) quarantine of the newly arrived rodents in a remote area that provides barriers to transmission of agents to colony animals; and (3) a program to monitor the health of the animals prior to release from the quarantine area. Some quarantine facilities house rodents in static microisolation cages, some on ventilated racks, some in individually ventilated cubicles, and, although more rarely, some in semirigid isolators. Used properly, any of these housing modalities can provide effective isolation. Isolators are labor-intensive to use and service but provide very good isolation.",

The quarantine typically lasts 4\u20138 weeks to allow sufficient time for sentinels to get infected and seroconvert. Alternatively, the need for sentinel testing can be bypassed and the time in quarantine reduced to about 2 weeks by PCR testing of noninvasive, ante mortem specimens (e.g., feces and swabs of the fur, perianal region, and oral cavity) collected directly from the principals within a week of their arrival. By reducing the time in quarantine, direct PCR testing of principals makes more efficient use of quarantine space, decreases the chance of cross-infection among imported cohorts, and affords investigators quicker access to their animals. Most importantly, as shown in a recent study, direct PCR testing of principals is more sensitive than indirect sentinel screening (Henderson et al., 2013), which is not unexpected as PCR typically detects pathogen levels well below the infectious dose for animals and cell culture (Bauer et al., 2004, Bauer and Riley, 2006, Blank et al., 2004).",

By contrast to chemical disinfection, these methods do not leave a residue or by-products that may be toxic for or cause physiologic changes in animals (Hermann et al., 1982). Raw materials used in the preparation of animal feed and bedding frequently have a high bacteria count. The heating of food to 75\u201380\u00b0C during pelleting substantially reduces the bacterial count but is not sufficient to inactivate thermostable pathogens. In addition, food and bedding may become recontaminated after processing (Clarke et al., 1977). Therefore, they should be sterilized or pasteurized for gnotobiotic or SPF rodent colonies, respectively. As mentioned, this has traditionally been accomplished by autoclaving (i.e., saturated steam heat) or gamma irradiation. In comparison with gamma irradiation, autoclaving is less expensive but causes a greater reduction in the nutritional value of food (Ferrando et al., 1981). Another drawback of autoclaving is the difficulty in achieving uniform steam penetration and temperature throughout a load (Small, 1983). Presterilization vacuum cycles help preserve the nutritional value of food by promoting rapid and uniform steam penetration, which allows autoclave times to be kept short (Foster et al., 1964, Maerki et al., 1989).",

Although ionizing irradiation has a variety of physical and biochemical effects, it mainly renders microorganisms nonviable by causing breakage in their nucleic acid (Silverman, 1991). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (210\u2013328 nm), which does not possess sufficient energy to cause ionization, also inactivates microorganisms by damaging their DNA but does not cause DNA breakage. Instead, UV irradiation produces thymine and other pyrimidine dimers. As one might expect, the bactericidal activity of UV irradiation is maximal near the peak of DNA absorption, which is 260 nm (Russell, 1991). Gamma radiation passes through solid objects; by contrast, UV radiation does not and therefore is effective only for disinfection of surfaces and drinking water. UV inactivation of microbes in drinking water is reduced as the UV light source loses intensity or becomes dirty and by the presence of particles and dissolved organics in the water (Sobsey, 1989). Nonetheless, UV irradiation is an attractive option for water disinfection because it is virucidal and, in contrast to chlorination, does not convert organic precursors into potentially carcinogenic trihalomethanes (Flood, 1995).",

Removal of virus from water can be achieved, however, by ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis. Although there are no reports implicating water as a source of adventitious viral infections for laboratory rodents, the possibility should be taken seriously because rodents are susceptible to infection with viruses that are taxonomically related to waterborne human viruses. Characteristically, waterborne viruses are of small to medium size, nonenveloped (and hence stable), and shed in the feces (Block and Schwartzbrod, 1989).",

Various schemes have been developed to link the physicochemical characteristics of microorganisms with susceptibility to chemical inactivation. For example, the Klein\u2013DeForest scheme for viruses, associates sensitivity to disinfectants with viral solubility (Table 11.3\n). Phenolics and quaternary ammonium compounds, which disrupt lipid membranes, are more potent against lipophilic, enveloped viruses than against hydrophilic, nonenveloped viruses. Oxidants attack all organic compounds and thus inactivate hydrophilic as well as lipophilic viruses (Klein and Deforest, 1983, Prince et al., 1991). A disinfection scale for all microbial taxa likely to be encountered in lab animals, derived from one proposed by Prince et al. (1991), is presented in Table 11.4\n. In brief, this scale recapitulates the generalization made at the beginning of this section that enveloped viruses and vegetative bacteria are considerably easier to inactivate than are nonenveloped viruses, bacterial endospores, and free-living parasite stages. For the most part, a disinfectant that has been shown to inactivate microorganisms of a particular susceptibility group will inactivate infectious agents in more susceptible groups. For instance, a disinfectant that inactivates parvoviruses (Table 11.3, Category C) will certainly kill non-spore-forming bacteria such as S. aureus (Table 11.3, Category A).",

Chlorine is a strong oxidant that reacts not only with living microorganisms but also with inorganic reducing substances such as ferrous iron and organic impurities, including dissolved proteins.

However, practices can be instituted that reduce this risk. Animal care technicians should be prohibited from having pet rodents although enforcement is challenging. There is also a risk associated with procuring rodents from pet stores for feeding snakes or other reptiles kept as pets. In many institutions, visitors are permitted to enter animal facilities only if they have not had recent contact with lab animals. Breeders with large production rooms may have a dedicated staff for each room. Access to smaller colonies, for which a dedicated staff is not practical, should still be restricted, and the flow of people and supplies should always be from \u2018clean\u2019 to \u2018dirty\u2019 areas. Personnel entering a barrier room should gown in a manner that keeps areas of exposed skin to a minimum in order to reduce the potential for transmitting infectious agents. Alternatively, it has become common practice to limit animal\u2013human contact by housing rodents in microisolation cages (Lipman, 1999) or isolators (Trexler, 1983). Contact is limited further by manipulating rodents in a laminar flow hood and by handling them with disinfected gloves or forceps.",

            "text": "Inoculation of rodents and other lab animals with untested biologicals, particularly transplantable tumor lines and reagents derived from animal tissues and fluids (Collins and Parker, 1972, Dick et al., 1996, Lipman et al., 2000, Nicklas et al., 1993), has represented a major risk for adventitious viral infections. In fact, many indigenous rodent viruses were discovered as contaminants of animal-derived biologicals that confounded research findings (Bonnard et al., 1976, Hartley and Rowe, 1960, Mckisic et al., 1993, Riley et al., 1960, Rowe and Capps, 1961). Failing to screen biological materials for rodent viruses has also been a public health concern as LCMV has been a relatively prevalent contaminant of cell lines (Bhatt et al., 1986a, Lewis et al., 1965, Simon et al., 1982) and hantaviruses have been isolated from transplantable rat tumors (Lloyd and Jones, 1986, Yamanishi et al., 1983). Traditionally, biologicals were screened for rodent viruses by the mouse and rat antibody production (MAP and RAP) tests (Collins and Parker, 1972, Desousa and Smith, 1989, Lewis and Clayton, 1971, Nicklas et al., 1993, Shek, 1983) as well as other in vivo and cultural isolation techniques (Lussier, 1991, Smith, 1986a). Briefly, in an antibody production test, SPF rodents are inoculated with the test article orally and parenterally, held in isolation for a month, and tested by serology for antibodies to rodent viruses; detection of viral antibodies is tantamount to demonstrating infective virus in the test article. MAP and RAP tests continue to be required for cell substrates used in the production of regulated biopharmaceuticals. However, viral PCR tests have replaced antibody production tests of research biologicals because PCR assays are faster, more sensitive, and less costly, and achieve the goal of reduced animal usage espoused in the Three Rs [replacement, reduction, refinement] (3Rs) (Bauer et al., 2004, Blank et al., 2004).",

As neither barrier systems nor the people who maintain rodent colonies are infallible and assays inevitably yield some level of inaccurate results, the complementary approaches of rigorous biosecurity and routine HM are essential to maintaining SPF lab animals. Similarly, QC for biological research reagents should complement testing with procedures to reduce the risk of microbial contamination including (1) obtaining biological reagents from reputable suppliers able to provide material traceability and lot analysis information, i.e., a Certificate of Analysis. Tissues, cells, blood, and so on. should be from animal populations shown to be healthy and SPF according to observations and testing carried out over an extended period. (2) Applying physical or chemical treatments to reagents that are able to withstand them to remove or inactivate infectious agents, e.g., heat inactivation or detergent treatment of serum. (3) Preventing operator-induced contaminations by using PPE, a biological safety hood, and sterile technique. (4) Banking (i.e., cryopreserving vials of) cell lines and microorganisms to ensure that you always have access to starting material that is well characterized and free of extraneous or pathogenic microorganisms, and for which you have documented key information such as designation, lot, species and strain, provenance, preparation method, and QC test results (Shek, 2007).",

In diagnostic and experimental lab animal microbiology, microbial antigens or nucleic acid in tissue sections can be specifically stained by immunohistochemistry (Allen et al., 1981, Brownstein and Barthold, 1982, Cera et al., 1994, Hall and Ward, 1984, Jacoby et al., 1975, Sundberg et al., 1989) or in situ hybridization (Gaertner et al., 1993, Jacoby et al., 1995, Smith et al., 1993a), respectively. However, these specific staining techniques are rarely if ever used in routine HM. Instead, the presence of pathogens in tissues is demonstrated by PCR of nucleic acid extracted usually from tissue homogenates, but also fixed tissue sections (Henderson et al., 2012).",

The latter method has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing helminth infestations (Huerkamp, 1993, West et al., 1992). Microscopic examination of skin scrapings may be necessary to detect mites, such as Demodex and Notoedres, which burrow into the epidermis (Weisbroth, 1979b, Wescott, 1982). It has been reported that fur mites can be found in a higher percentage of mice by microscopic examination of adhesive tape applied to the dorsal fur than by checking the skin or skin scrapings (Ricart Arbona et al., 2010a, West et al., 1992). Fur \u2018plucks\u2019 taken from multiple sites on the dorsal surface (e.g., between the scapulae, near base of the tail) and microscopically examined in Petri dishes also yield reasonably accurate results (Rice et al., 2013), but all of these are limited by sampling \u2018error\u2019 compared to pelt digestion (Owen, 1972), which samples the entire, but deceased, host. Fur mite eggs can also be observed on perianal tape tests used to detect pinworm eggs if the mite infestation is very heavy. Infections with enteric protozoa are diagnosed by examining wet mounts of mucosal scrapings of the small and large intestines with a phase-contrast microscope, which makes it possible to see unstained microorganisms (Brock, 1970, Weisbroth et al., 1996); however, histologic examination of the gastrointestinal tract is best for detecting Cryptosporidium (Wasson, 2007). Phase-contrast microscopy is also used for more precise morphologic identification of adult helminths and mites, and to examine fecal floats or centrifugation concentrates for helminth ova and protozoan cysts, tape applied perianally for Syphacia pinworm eggs, and tape applied to the fur for mites (Rice et al., 2013, Weisbroth, 1979b, Weisbroth et al., 1998, Weiss et al., 2012).",

Furthermore, direct examinations are characterized by low analytical sensitivity, that is, the lesions and organisms in stained tissue sections and the intact parasite stages that these tests target must be present at high concentrations to be observed, particularly when specimens are examined microscopically as is almost always done. As the level of magnification increases, there is a commensurate rise in the minimum target concentration required for detection. As an extreme example, the minimum concentration of virus that can be detected by transmission electron microscopy is 105\u2013106 particles per milliliter (Miller, 1995). High magnification further limits sensitivity by constraining the amount of sample that is practical to examine.",

            "text": "According to sampling statistics (Anonymous, 1976, Clifford, 2001, Dubin and Zietz, 1991, Selwyn and Shek, 1994), the likelihood of detecting an outbreak is enhanced by increasing the number of animals evaluated, but this also increases the labor of sample collection along with the cost of testing. One way of increasing the sample size, while controlling HM costs, is to test sample pools; however, sample pooling is limited by the low analytical sensitivity of direct examinations. Because principal animals at research institutions are seldom made available to be euthanized for routine HM, the number of animals that can be sampled is further restricted by the need to examine postmortem specimens for optimal detection of some types of parasites, such as macerated gastrointestinal tract for adult helminths, intestinal scrapings for protozoan trophozoites, and the pelt for ectoparasites (Parkinson et al., 2011). Therefore, postmortem specimen collection and examinations are usually restricted to a small number of sentinels (e.g., one or two sentinels per rack). In addition to limiting sample size, the main shortcoming of sentinel surveillance is the risk that sentinels will not become infected (or infested) with pathogens harbored by the principal animals. This is of greatest concern when monitoring resident rodents housed in microisolation cages using sentinels exposed to pooled soiled bedding because, as discussed, certain pathogens including mites (Grove et al., 2012, Henderson et al., 2013, Lindstrom et al., 2011) are poorly transmitted in bedding and sentinels may be exposed to subinfectious doses of pathogens when the prevalence of infection is low, as commonly occurs in microisolation cages, or when sentinels are resistant to an infection due to their age or genetic background.",

            "text": "Animal specimens, artificial cell-free agar and broth media, and incubation conditions are chosen to favor the isolation and cultivation of primary and opportunistic microbial pathogens while limiting the growth of commensal and autochthonous microorganisms (Ganaway, 1976, Orcutt, 1980, Weisbroth, 1979a, Weisbroth et al., 1998). The animal sites most often sampled \u2013 the upper respiratory tract and large intestine \u2013 possess a complex microbiome that can overgrow cultures and obscure colonies of interest. To lessen this problem, specimens are cultured with selective media that contain additives, such as dyes or antibiotics, to inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms. MacConkey\u2019s agar, e.g., contains crystal violet and bile salts that selectively inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria, while allowing most gram-negative bacteria to grow (Forbes et al., 1998). Media for the isolation of Helicobacter spp. from fecal or intestinal specimens contain a mixture of antibiotics to selectively inhibit the growth of the intestinal microbiome (Fox et al., 1994). Overgrowth can be further reduced by culturing sites that do not possess a normal microbiome to obscure invasive bacteria. Tracheal cultures from Bordetella bronchiseptica-infected animals contain few extraneous bacteria, making it easier to view B. bronchiseptica colonies (Bemis et al., 2003, Brownstein et al., 1985). Corynebacterium kutscheri is most reliably isolated from the submaxillary lymph nodes of infected rats (Brownstein et al., 1985). Enrichment media are used to encourage the growth of particular bacteria, which are at low concentration in a specimen containing many microorganisms. Selenite broth is an enrichment medium that is used to recover salmonella from feces or the intestinal tract (Orcutt, 1980). Media are categorized as differential when they allow colonies to be morphologically differentiated based on metabolic characteristics. On MacConkey\u2019s agar, lactose-fermenting bacteria produce pink to red colonies, whereas colonies of non-lactose fermenters remain colorless (Forbes et al., 1998). Cultures are usually incubated aerobically at 35\u201337\u00b0C because the majority of clinically important bacteria are facultative anaerobes that will grow under these conditions, whereas the strict anaerobes that constitute the autochthonous microbiome will not. PCR and/or serology are used instead of culture to screen for fastidious and noncultivable microbial pathogens such as M. pulmonis (Davidson et al., 1981, Kraft et al., 1982, Loganbill et al., 2005), Helicobacter spp. (Whary et al., 2000b), C. piliforme (the etiology of Tyzzer\u2019s disease) (Goto and Itoh, 1996, Motzel and Riley, 1991, Pritt et al., 2010), cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus (Cundiff et al., 1994a, Lukas et al., 1987, Matsushita et al., 1987), and Pneumocystis spp. (Henderson et al., 2012, Hong et al., 1995, Livingston et al., 2011).",

So-called next-generation sequencing in which millions of DNA fragments from a single sample are sequenced in unison is already being used to characterize the intestinal microbiome (Friswell et al., 2010), but currently is far too expensive and complicated for routine identification of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens (Grada and Weinbrecht, 2013).",

Identifications by the MALDI-TOF MS are performed on actively growing cultures, or extracts made from them, and are based on unique peptidic spectra primarily of ribosomal and other housekeeping proteins that are expressed at high levels. The peak intensity and position of the spectra are compared to those in a database to establish identifications. The principal advantages of MALDI-TOF MS in comparison with biochemical testing are that it is much more rapid (completed in minutes instead of hours to days) and has a lower cost per identification, although the mass spectrometer instrument is very expensive. MALDI-TOF MS is also highly reliable and accurate since it is based on molecules that are less dependent on growth conditions and not subject to the expression variability seen in phenotypic systems (Seng et al., 2009). Because of the aforementioned advantages, MALDI-TOF MS is increasingly employed, in place of traditional phenotypic techniques, for human and veterinary diagnostic microbiology.",

In the mid-1980s, traditional homo\u00adgenous serologic techniques (with the term homogeneous indicating that sample and assay reagents are mixed and incubated together in solution) such as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), complement fixation, and virus neutralization were supplanted by more sensitive and broadly applicable heterogeneous solid-phase immunoassays, notably the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) schematically depicted in Figure 11.2, Figure 11.3\n, respectively (Kraft et al., 1982, Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999, Parker et al., 1979, Smith, 1983a, Smith, 1983b, Smith, 1986b, Takahashi et al., 1986, Voller et al., 1982). The \u2018solid phase\u2019 denotes the surface to which the antigen is attached. For ELISA, antigen, consisting of purified virus particles, microbial cell extracts, or recombinant proteins encoded by microbial genes of interest, is immobilized on the surface of wells in microtiter plates made of specially prepared polystyrene or polyvinyl; separate wells may be coated with an extract of uninfected host cells (or with antigen from other microorganisms), often called a \u2018tissue control\u2019, to detect nonspecific binding of immunoglobulin (Ig). For IFA, infected and uninfected cells are fixed to wells on glass slides. The fixative is usually cold acetone, which permeabilizes the cell membrane, making the intracellular viral antigens accessible to antibodies in the serum samples. \u2018Heterogeneous\u2019 indicates that each incubation period is followed by a wash step to separate antibody bound to the solid phase from unbound antibody. The wash step also removes interfering substances in a specimen that could compromise the sensitivity or specificity of a corresponding traditional homogeneous test. \u2018Indirect\u2019 refers to detection of serum antibodies bound to the solid phase (whether as specific antigen\u2013antibody complexes or nonspecifically) by labeled anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), such as goat IgG anti-mouse IgG, or Ig-binding bacterial proteins including Proteins A and G (Delellis, 1981, Hrapchak, 1980). Common non-radioisotopic labels include the enzymes horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase for ELISA and the fluorescent dye fluorescein for IFA (Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999, Voller et al., 1982).",

            "text": "A direct solid-phase immunoassay, as shown in Fig. 11.3a, is one in which a label is coupled to the microbial antibodies rather than anti-Ig or Ig-binding bacterial protein for indirect labeling. Although labeled microbial antibodies are incorporated into blocking or competitive assays for serum antibodies (Vonderfecht et al., 1985), they are more commonly used in fluorescence and enzyme immunoassays when doing research on the time course and distribution of infections in situ, i.e., in animal tissues and cells (Allen et al., 1981, Brownstein and Barthold, 1982, Cera et al., 1994, Dick et al., 1996, Jacoby et al., 1975, Kimsey et al., 1986, Sundberg et al., 1989, Weir et al., 1988) and in specimens using techniques such as the double-antibody sandwich antigen capture method (Jure et al., 1988, Newsome and Coney, 1985, Vonderfecht et al., 1988). While solid-phase antigen capture immunoassays for pathogens have been popular in domestic and companion animal and human diagnostics, they have seldom been utilized in laboratory HM for a variety of reasons. First, as already discussed, the window of active infection and shedding is often short-lived. Even when an infection is active, the concentration of microbial antigens in animal specimens may be below the assay\u2019s detection limit, which is why MPV pathogenesis studies have utilized in situ hybridization (Jacoby et al., 1995, Smith et al., 1993a) and PCR (Besselsen et al., 2000, Besselsen et al., 2007) to detect viral DNA rather than antigens. Also, antigen immunoassay development, particularly obtaining or producing microbial antibodies of the appropriate specificity, can be a long and expensive process with an unpredictable outcome; this helps explain why most of the few evaluations of antigen-capture immunoassays for HM have utilized commercial kits that had been developed for other host species, but recognized a group antigen shared with the related lab animal pathogen. Human group-A rotavirus kits, for instance, have been assessed for detection of mouse rotavirus in fecal specimens (Jure et al., 1988, Newsome and Coney, 1985). Finally, the importance of antigen-capture immunoassays in diagnostics has been substantially diminished by the advent of more sensitive and specific molecular genetic assays \u2013 especially PCR assays \u2013 that are better suited to direct detection of infectious agents in animal and environmental samples (Wilde et al., 1990).",

Color development can be read visually in a qualitative or semiquantitative fashion, but is usually read with a spectrophotometer, or ELISA plate reader, that exports optical density readings to a computer for analysis and reporting (Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999, Voller et al., 1982). By contrast, IFA reactions are examined manually using a fluorescence microscope; analysts classify test serum reactions as negative to strong positive or nonspecific by comparing the pattern, intracellular location, and intensity of fluorescence to those observed with standard immune and nonimmune control sera (Lyerla and Forrester, 1979).",

The IFA, however, has proven to be an excellent method for confirmatory testing because the pattern of fluorescence and whether it is located in the host cell nucleus, cytoplasm, or both is useful in distinguishing specific from nonspecific reactions. In addition, IFA are generally as sensitive as corresponding ELISA (Homberger et al., 1995, Kraft et al., 1982, Smith, 1983a) and they can be more \u2018inclusive\u2019, i.e., better able to detect seroconversion to heterologous viral strains and serotypes (OIE, 2013), when the host develops antibodies to highly conserved nonstructural viral protein antigens found in the infected cells that compose IFA antigen, but not necessarily in ELISA antigen consisting of purified virus particles. The inclusivity of the IFA (specifically, its ability to detect antibodies to the nonstructural proteins conserved among rodent parvoviruses in mouse and rat populations that were largely MVM and rat virus (RV) seronegative by serotype-specific HAI and by ELISA with virus particle antigen) provided the initial evidence for the existence of then-novel rodent parvoviruses later identified as MPV, rat parvovirus, and rat minute virus (Jacoby et al., 1996).",

            "text": "The prior rodent parvovirus example demonstrates that inclusivity is a preferred attribute of primary assays because it can enhance diagnostic sensitivity, i.e., the proportion of infected animals that test positive. Moreover, a single inclusive assay can replace several \u2018exclusive\u2019, i.e., strain-specific tests, thereby reducing the number tests and the cost of surveillance; however, this comes with a risk of false-negative (FN) findings if the antibody response to the conserved antigen (variously called shared or group-specific antigens) is delayed, weak, or absent, as has been demonstrated for the antibody response of rodents to the parvovirus nonstructural protein NS1 (Besselsen et al., 2000, Filipovska-Naumovska et al., 2010a, Henderson et al., 2015, Livingston et al., 2002). Solid-phase immunoassays tend to be more inclusive than corresponding traditional tests because they can detect antibodies to any of the epitopes (i.e., antigenic sites) presented by the microbial antigens attached to the solid phase and at much lower levels (Parker et al., 1979), which improves detection of low-titered \u2018cross-reacting\u2019 antibodies to shared or group-specific antigens. By contrast, virus neutralization and HAI are highly exclusive because by definition they only recognize antibodies to viral surface protein antigens that are unique to the serotype or strain of virus being used in the test. Although this high level of exclusivity is not favored for primary surveillance, it is desirable for confirmatory testing to delineate the strain or serotype specificity and, thus, the etiology of the viral antibody response (Parker et al., 1965). The inclusivity and high analytical sensitivity of solid-phase immunoassays has expanded lab animal serosurveillance to pathogens for which traditional serologic tests had not been developed because they were not sufficiently sensitive or applicable. Examples of agents added to serologic panels after the advent of solid-phase methods are mouse rotavirus (Smith) and invasive microbial pathogens including M. pulmonis (Cassell et al., 1983, Minion et al., 1984), C. piliforme (Motzel and Riley, 1991, Waggie et al., 1987), Helicobacter spp. (Fox et al., 1996, Whary et al., 2000b), and CAR bacillus (Lukas et al., 1987, Matsushita et al., 1987), Pneumocystis carinii (Henderson et al., 2012, Hong et al., 1995) and Encephalitozoon cuniculi (Digiacomo et al., 1983).\n",

            "text": "To be performed optimally, ELISA and other solid-phase immunoassays generally require antigen that is more concentrated and pure than was needed for the traditional homogenous tests they replaced. During the 1990s, advances in recombinant DNA technology made it possible to produce large quantities of recombinant protein rapidly from a cloned gene of interest inserted into microbial, mammalian, or baculovirus (an insect virus) expression vector systems. These systems have facilitated the production of pure and potent antigen, particularly for infectious agents that are fastidious, noncultivable, or zoonotic (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002, Filipovska-Naumovska et al., 2010a, Homberger et al., 1995, Katz et al., 2012, Schmaljohn et al., 1990). Thus, these systems have obviated the need to propagate a pathogen in culture and the recombinant proteins they generate are noninfectious. In addition, microbial genes of interest have been \u2018fused\u2019 to sequences that encode affinity tags, such as 6 \u00d7 histidine, to permit purification of the recombinant proteins by affinity chromatography (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002, Riley et al., 1996b, Seletsakia et al., 2004). Recombinant viral capsid proteins, such as the parvovirus VP2, that self-assemble into virus-like particles, or VLPs, can also be purified by gradient centrifugation and other conventional techniques (Kahn et al., 2008, Livingston et al., 2002). Finally, incorporating recombinant protein antigens representing different viral strains and proteins into serosurveillance panels has enhanced diagnostic accuracy by being more inclusive and permitting confirmation and characterization of antibody specificity.",

At the conclusion of an assay procedure, beads from test wells flow single file through an array reader (which is a modified flow cytometer); each bead is interrogated by two laser beams: one to identify the bead color set (i.e., test) and the other to measure the intensity of fluorescence emitted by the reporter dye phycoerythrin (Fig. 11.4\n). A predetermined minimum number of beads are read for each assay (i.e., bead set) in a well and the intensity of fluorescence for each test is reported as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) (De Jager et al., 2003, Richens et al., 2010).",

Briefly, an antigen or control (e.g., tissue control) is covalently coupled to beads of a specific color. Although up to 100 different tests could be included in an MFIA panel, the largest serologic panels for HM contain fewer than 40. Antigen\u2013antibody complexes that form during the serum incubation (as well as nonspecifically bound antibodies) are detected by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Ig or by biotinylated anti-Ig followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (a protein that binds strongly to biotin).

Moreover, multiplexing conserves reagents, reduces the volume of waste fluids, and permits high-throughput testing without complex and expensive automation. These efficiencies have made it practical to add confirmatory antibody assays for common adventitious agents and internal controls to panels to enhance the quality and reliability of serologic findings. In addition to standard tissue control bead sets for detecting nonspecific binding of serum Ig, MFIA panels have incorporated a bead set coated with Ig of the test species to detect procedural errors such as the failure to add labeled anti-Ig to a well and a set coated with anti-test species Ig to identify samples with inadequate levels of Ig; failures of the latter control occur most often because the sample is from an animal that is immunocompromised or different from the test species.",

Although new to HM, DBS technology has long been used for human neonatal screening (Mei et al., 2001) and is increasingly employed for serial sampling of rodents in pharmacologic studies (Beaudette and Bateman, 2004). Collecting the drop of blood for preparing a DBS is minimally invasive and therefore can easily be performed on unanesthetized animals. In addition, the use of DBS eliminates the steps, reagents, and equipment required for serum preparation and DBS can be safely shipped in envelopes at ambient temperature in contrast to serum samples. Ante mortem blood collection for preparing DBS facilitates direct sampling of colony animals to supplement sentinel monitoring, to verify positive sentinel findings, and to identify infected animals to be culled.",

They are applicable mainly to viruses and seldom used for bacteria, with the exception of M. pulmonis, CAR bacillus, and E. cuniculi, or fungi due to poor specificity compared to viruses, which are less complex with their smaller genomes. Bacteria and fungi also induce weak antibody responses unless they are invasive. Poor sensitivity can occur when antigen purified from one bacterial strain does not cross-react with antibodies to others (Manning et al., 1994). Additional limitations of serology include the requirement for an immunocompetent host that is susceptible to infection by virtue of age and genotype. Thus, serology is not suitable for direct testing of known immunodeficient or \u2018immunovague\u2019 genetically engineered principals to confirm or eradicate an adventitious infection.

Reporter probes (usually 100\u20131000 bases long) for hybridization assays are directly or indirectly labeled with a radioisotope, an enzyme that acts on a chromogenic or chemiluminescent substrate, or a fluorescent dye. Assays begin with immobilization of the sample nucleic acid in situ or by blotting onto nitrocellulose or nylon membranes. For example, Southern (after the developer E.M. Southern) and Northern (a play on words) refer to blots of DNA and RNA, respectively (Cundiff et al., 1994b, Hsu and Choppin, 1984). Alternatively, target sequences in a specimen can be captured by an unlabeled probe attached to a solid phase, e.g., a chip, bead, or microtiter plate well (Goto and Itoh, 1996). Prior to hybridization, double-stranded sample and probe DNA must be denatured to single-stranded DNA by heating (e.g., 90\u2013100\u00b0C) or exposure to alkaline conditions. The reaction mixture is then cooled (to 55\u201365\u00b0C) to permit the formation of stable probe-target hybrids (which can be RNA to RNA, DNA to DNA, or DNA to RNA). Raising the temperature of incubation during hybridization enhances assay specificity by increasing the degree of complementarity necessary for stable probe\u2013target hybrids to form. Free probe can be removed by washing (as is done in heterogeneous solid-phase immunoassays) or digestion with an enzyme that attacks single-stranded nucleic acids. Finally, the degree of hybridization is determined by measuring the signal emitted by the probe label or the enzyme-substrate product (Fig. 11.5\n) (Tang and Persing, 1999, Tenover, 1998).\n",

These limitations have been overcome by the development of practical and robust technologies for rapid biochemical amplification, or copying, of target (or probe) nucleic acid sequences entirely in vitro.

To reduce the risk of missing an adventitious infection, primary PCR assays for microbiological surveillance maximize inclusivity by using primers targeting genes that are conserved among strains of a pathogen, such as the nonstructural NS-1 gene of parvoviruses (Besselsen et al., 1995a), or a mixture of primers that account for strain variation. By contrast, the secondary PCR assays for confirming or investigating outbreaks frequently emphasize exclusivity by targeting genes that differentiate among pathogen variants, such as the capsid gene of parvoviruses (Besselsen et al., 1995b). PCR primers for bacteria and parasites chiefly target sequences in the ribosomal genes (Battles et al., 1995, Beckwith et al., 1997, Fox et al., 1994, Goto and Itoh, 1996, Greisen et al., 1994, Grove et al., 2012, Loganbill et al., 2005, Shames et al., 1995), which have been extensively analyzed and contain both conserved and differential regions, but sequences in other well-characterized genes are targeted too, for instance, the RNA polymerase rpoB gene of bacteria (Dole et al., 2010, Dole et al., 2013b, Gundi et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The most widely used PCR technique that relies on labeled probe hybridization for sequence-specific identification of amplicons is the fluorogenic nuclease, or TaqMan, assay, in which amplification and hybridization occur concurrently (Heid et al., 1996, Holland et al., 1991). The TaqMan probe is an oligonucleotide that anneals to a DNA template sequence between the forward and reverse primers and is tagged on opposite ends with a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher dye. As long as the probe is intact and the dyes are in close proximity, the reporter signal is quenched. But when extending a primer, the Taq DNA polymerase uses its 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease activity to digest annealed probe (Fig. 11.8A\n). The resultant separation of the reporter from its quencher generates a sequence-specific fluorescent signal that can be read after each amplification cycle, i.e., in \u2018real time\u2019, or once at the end of the PCR assay. In the real-time assay, results are reported as the number of cycles required to reach a (low) threshold signal, or Ct (for cycle threshold), which is inversely related to the copies of DNA template added to the reaction (Gibson et al., 1996, Heid et al., 1996, Kendall et al., 2000, Kutyavin et al., 2000, Leutenegger, 2001) (Fig. 11.8B). To avoid the confusion that would arise if both the real-time and reverse transcription PCR used the prefix RT, real-time assays are referred to as quantitative (q) PCR. Particularly for pathogens that are present in very high copy numbers in specimens from infected animals, estimating the copy number is helpful for identifying and discounting low-copy positive results due to contamination with template from other samples, controls, or the environment. Other important advantages of the TaqMan technique in comparison with the gel-based method include better analytical specificity and sensitivity due to the internal probe, less risk of contamination because reaction tubes stay closed post amplification, and higher throughput as there are no post-PCR processing steps and reactions are automatically read by a fluorometer and transferred to a computer for analysis and reporting. Moreover, several systems are available for creating spatial multiplexes of TaqMan PCR, including the OpenArray platform, which has been used in research animal HM (Henderson et al., 2013) and biologics testing. As each test in an OpenArray chip occupies a separate location, the OpenArray avoids the pitfalls of competitive inhibition (Hamilton et al., 2002) and low specificity (Lo et al., 1998) that can affect standard homogenous PCR multiplexes created by mixing of multiple primer sets together in a single well. Because of these advantages, fluorogenic nuclease PCR has been developed for many pathogens of rodents including viruses (Besselsen et al., 2003, Blank et al., 2004, Drazenovich et al., 2002, Ge et al., 2001, Redig and Besselsen, 2001, Uchiyama and Besselsen, 2003, Wagner et al., 2003, Wagner et al., 2004), microbes (Dole et al., 2010, Dole et al., 2013b, Drazenovich et al., 2002, Ge et al., 2001, Henderson et al., 2012, Whary et al., 2001), and parasites (Dole et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2013, Rice et al., 2013, Weiss et al., 2012).",

PCR can detect low concentrations of infectious agent template in heavily pooled and therefore highly representative samples such as room or ventilated rack exhaust air dust and noninvasive specimens collected ante mortem directly from animals in residence or quarantine \u2013 samples that are unlikely to contain enough viable bacteria and fungi or intact parasites to be suitable for traditional microbiology or parasitology, respectively. Thus, by allowing testing of principal and environmental samples, PCR addresses the main shortcomings of sentinel HM, which is that it depends on transmission of adventitious infections of the principal animals to the sentinels. This transmission, however, may not occur when the adventitious agent is inactivated in soiled bedding; the percentage of actively infected animals is low as is common for rodents housed in microisolation caging systems; or sentinels are resistant to infection due to their age or genetic background.",

The exquisite sensitivity of the PCR makes it especially vulnerable to false-positive (FP) findings following even minute levels of template contamination from test samples (and is most likely to occur for prevalent organisms that are present in high copy numbers), controls, the environment, and so forth. This risk of contamination, which represents a significant challenge to high-throughput screening, can be reduced by physical separation of pre- and postamplification procedures, decontamination of work surfaces with chemicals or UV irradiation, and enzymatic digestion or chemical inactivation of amplified template. Estimating the copy number by qPCR can be helpful in discounting low-copy positive results not associated with an active infection.",

Furthermore, PCR continues to detect template in exhaust air dust swabs even after principal and sentinel animals have stopped shedding a pathogen. PCR results can be FN due to sample-mediated inhibition, but this can be detected by including an internal control assay or by spiking a duplicate reaction with template. Finally, PCR is still relatively labor-intensive and costly, although the cost of PCR testing can be contained by pooling of samples from various animal sites appropriate to the organisms being detected and the environment.",

Estimates of DSe and DSp are obtained by testing known positive and negative samples from pathogen-infected and pathogen-free animals, respectively, and by comparing an assay\u2019s results to those of a \u2018gold-standard\u2019 reference test. For serologic and PCR assay methods that yield numeric titers or instrument readings such as optical density or fluorescence intensity, sample results are classified as positive (+), negative (\u2212), or equivocal (+/\u2212) compared to positive and negative cutoff values, as shown in Fig. 11.9\n. Raw instrument readings may be used as the result values, but a common practice is to calculate values from one or more instrument readings in order to simplify the examination and classification of test results by (1) reducing the number of digits and decimals, (2) subtracting background so that negative result values are near zero, and/or (3) normalizing values, e.g., scoring sample readings in comparison with the positive control for the assay run. In addition, a sample result may be classified as indeterminate when a sample suitability control fails because the sample reacted nonspecifically or was inhibitory, or its quantity or target concentration was insufficient. Examples of the system and sample suitability controls utilized for serology by MFIA and for PCR assays are shown in Table 11.5\n. Sample results should only be classified (and reported) if the standard positive and negative system suitability control results were satisfactory, thereby demonstrating that assay sensitivity and specificity were acceptable. Thus, including the appropriate system and sample suitability controls in each assay run is essential to diagnostic accuracy.\n",

The amount of separation between positive and negative signals is dependent on an assay\u2019s analytical sensitivity and specificity. The former is measured as the limit of detection (LOD), which is the lowest concentration of a target analyte (e.g., antibody, organism, or genomic sequence) in a specific matrix (e.g., serum, tissue homogenate, or feces) that can consistently yield a positive result. For PCR, samples can be \u2018spiked\u2019 with a known number of template copies to determine LOD; however, as quantifying the actual concentration of polyclonal serum antibodies to multivalent microbial antigens is not feasible, the LOD of serologic immunoassays is usually presented as a comparison of titration endpoints for an antiserum by two or more tests. The analytical sensitivity needed for a surveillance assay depends on the expected range of concentrations of target analyte in specimens and the volume of sample tested. For example, a \u2018moderate\u2019 level of sensitivity suffices for the immunoassays used to screen for common viruses because these viruses typically elicit a strong antibody response in immunocompetent sentinels. By contrast, the extreme analytical sensitivity of PCR assays is important to their DSe because it allows detection of the low pathogen concentrations (or more correctly nucleic acid template copy number) expected in heavily pooled (e.g., 10:1) animal and environmental specimens; conversely, extreme analytical sensitivity can negatively impact the DSp of PCR when amplification of small quantities of template not associated with an active infection yields FP findings. As already mentioned and reviewed in the next section, sample selection errors, such as performing serology on acutely infected or PCR on convalescent hosts, can reduce the concentration of the targeted analyte below the test LOD.",

            "text": "Analytical specificity is defined as the ability of an assay to distinguish target from nontarget analytes, including matrix (i.e., specimen) components; it comprises selectivity, inclusivity, and exclusivity, (OIE, 2013). A selective assay is one with the capacity to resist matrix-mediated effects such as those detected by sample suitability controls including sample-mediated inhibition of the PCR, nonspecific binding of the serum antibodies (or labeled anti-Ig) to the solid phase, and target analyte degradation. Inclusivity refers to the ability of a single test to detect related organisms of interest, whereas exclusivity describes a test able to differentiate an infectious agent from others that are closely related. As a general strategy, inclusive assays are preferred for primary testing because they can reduce both the chance of missing an adventitious infection and the number of assays needed for surveillance. For example, lab animals are commonly screened for Helicobacter infection by a single inclusive PCR test that detects all species of the Helicobacter genus. Exclusive assays, however, are important for confirmatory testing to corroborate preliminary findings and to determine the species, strain, serotype, or genotype of an adventitious agent when it is relevant to the SPF status of the principals or useful for investigating an outbreak. In the case of Helicobacter, additional testing by a number of species-specific PCR tests is carried out to corroborate initial findings and because the Helicobacter species can affect the course of action. For instance, certain species, such as H. hepaticus and H. bilis, are considered to be more pathogenic and likely to interfere with research than others (Drazenovich et al., 2002, Henderson et al., 2013, Whary and Fox, 2004). An additional example of the importance of sequencing is derived from an investigation of murine rotaviruses recovered from concomitant outbreaks at multiple institutions. The agents had identical genotypes, and repeated testing that included genomic sequencing provided convincing evidence that linked the outbreaks to a common source of contaminated bedding (Dole et al., 2013a).",

Antigen for ELISA or MFIA may consist of organisms purified to varying degrees, organism extracts, or recombinant proteins, which have facilitated the development of assays with predictable analytical specificity. For example, ELISA and MFIA for viral antibodies that utilize a recombinant protein antigen conserved among related viruses, such as the nonstructural NS1 protein of parvoviruses (Riley et al., 1996b), the VP6 capsid of group A rotaviruses (Zhu et al., 2013), and the nucleocapsid NP protein of LCMV (Homberger et al., 1995), are inclusive, whereas those employing recombinant envelope or capsid protein antigen that possesses neutralizing epitopes, such as the parvovirus capsid protein VP2 capsid protein (Henderson et al., 2015, Livingston et al., 2002), are exclusive (i.e., primarily detect serotype specific antibodies). IFAs for viral antibodies are intrinsically inclusive because they typically use as antigen-infected cells containing all virally encoded proteins. By detecting antibodies to conserved nonstructural proteins, rodent parvovirus IFA provided the initial evidence in the 1980s for the existence of parvovirus serotypes in addition to those represented by the prototypical strains used at the time in serotype-specific HAI tests (Jacoby et al., 1996). Inclusivity achieved with complex antigen consisting of whole organisms, infected cells, or crude extracts of those, however, can increase the rate of false-positive findings when antibodies bind to nonmicrobial constituents of the antigen preparation or to antigenic determinants shared with commensal microbes; moreover, raising the positive cutoff to compensate for higher background is likely to reduce DSe. Relying on a single conserved recombinant protein antigen can also compromise DSe when the antigen is not consistently immunogenic or elicits an antibody response that is weak or delayed, as has been demonstrated for the rodent parvovirus antibody response to NS1 vis-\u00e0-vis capsid proteins.",

These challenges have been eased by access to increasingly sophisticated and cost-effective tools, techniques, and services for DNA sequencing and analysis that have expedited the identification of conserved and differential genomic sequences for PCR amplification in a wide variety of infectious agents. PCR (and probe hybridization) targets are generally more plentiful than those that can be distinguished by phenotypic tests because (1) they can be located in regions of the microbial genome that do not encode proteins and (2) the sequence of a gene often varies more than the amino acid sequence of the protein it encodes due to the degeneracy of the genetic code (i.e., multiple codons are translated into the same amino acid). In addition, the analytical specificity of genetic targets are unaffected by environmental and host-related factors that can alter the phenotype of an organism or humoral immune response to infection. Thus, the analytical specificity of PCR assays by and large exceeds that achievable by traditional tests.",

When the prevalence of infection is very low, as has been found for adventitious infections of animals housed in microisolation cages, a substantial percentage of positive results are expected to be FP, even for assays with DSp approaching 100%. The example shown in Fig. 11.10\nillustrates that for an assay with DSp and DSe that are 99%, dropping the prevalence of infection from 50% to 2% decreased the PPV from 99% to 67%; to put it another way, one-third of the positive results are expected by FP when the prevalence of infection is 2%.

However, use of resident animals for HM involves certain assumptions. One assumption is that the animals selected for monitoring have been adequately exposed to any infectious agents present. Exposure may be accomplished through husbandry practices, through the use of open-topped cages, or through transfer of potentially contaminated fomites such as soiled bedding. Sampling colony animals that are housed in individually ventilated cages without additional exposure such as through transfer of soiled bedding may be unlikely to test positive for any infectious agents present, as only a very small percentage of cages may be contaminated (Shek and Gaertner, 2002, Shek et al., 2005).

For barrier room colonies housed in open-topped cages, which are monitored by sampling of colony animals, this means that eight animals are sampled at each testing interval. This gives a 95% probability of detecting a pathogen when it reaches a prevalence of approximately 30% in the population; experience has shown that recently introduced viruses actually reach a prevalence above 50% within a single 4-week monitoring interval (Selwyn and Shek, 1994, Shek et al., 2005). For greater security, this type of facility may (and frequently does) choose to monitor more animals and/or sample more frequently. Today, a majority of research rodents are housed in static or ventilated microisolation cages where the prevalence of an agent is kept low by the very nature of this type of housing. If an agent were present at a 10% prevalence, 30 animals would need to be screened for a 95% chance of detection, and if an agent were present in only 1% of animals, then 300 animals would need to be screened (Clifford, 2001). Prevalence as low as 2% has been considered realistic for MPV infection of mice in IVC (Macy et al., 2009, Smith, 2010). Because sampling of sufficient numbers of mice to detect such low-prevalence infections is not feasible, most facilities use testing of sentinel animals.",

Sentinel animals are generally externally sourced animals that are introduced into a population, exposed to animals or soiled bedding from the population, and sampled in lieu of the principal animals. Sentinels should be immunocompetent so that they are suitable subjects for serology, and should have a mature immune system when sampled. Outbred stocks are recommended because they are generally good serologic responders and are usually less expensive. Conversely, inbred sentinels should be avoided because some inbred strains have been shown to be comparatively resistant to infection with or to mount a delayed antibody response to certain pathogens (Besselsen et al., 2000, Brownstein et al., 1981, Drake et al., 2008, Henderson et al., 2015, Hirai et al., 2010, Shek et al., 2005). Sentinels should be female, which will decrease fighting within the sentinel cage and lessen the chance of genetic contamination of the principal animals from contact sentinels. They should of course be free of all infectious agents, which would be of concern for the principals being monitored. If those agents include opportunistic pathogens, as might be the case for immunodeficient models, then sentinels should be obtained from gnotobiotic or SOPF colonies raised in isolators rather than barrier rooms. As mentioned, sentinels are externally sourced from commercial vendors because this is considered to be simpler and less expensive than attempting to produce clean sentinels internally. If, however, sentinel animals are bred at the facility, they should be monitored at an increased frequency, perhaps monthly, as they are a potential source of infection for the entire facility. However, there is a biosecurity risk associated with the routine receipt of sentinels from commercial vendors that is low but not zero (Pullium et al., 2004, Shek et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The current standard practice for routine surveillance of resident animals is to keep sentinels in separate cages supplied with regular changes of soiled bedding pooled from colony cages. Typically, one or two sentinel cages are set up for a rack of cages (frequently one cage per side of a rack). Contact sentinels are impractical for routine surveillance for several reasons, the most important being their potential to contribute to the spread of infection. Reliance on soiled bedding alone to transmit infections to sentinels, however, is problematic because infections with certain respiratory viruses, host-adapted bacteria, and parasites are transmitted inefficiently or not at all in soiled bedding (Artwohl et al., 1994, Compton et al., 2004c, Cundiff et al., 1995, Dillehay et al., 1990, Henderson et al., 2013, Ike et al., 2007, Lindstrom et al., 2011, Thigpen et al., 1989). In addition, the ability of microisolation cages to control the spread of infection frequently keeps the percentage of cages with actively infected rodents low, thus presenting challenges for detection by the HM program. Irrespective of the test methodology used, detection of transmission to sentinels is dependent on exposure of those animals to an infectious dose of the microbial contaminant. Thus, the lower the prevalence of infection, the greater the risk that the pathogen dose in pooled bedding will not be sufficient to infect sentinels. As cited above, that risk may increase as sentinels become older and less susceptible to infection with certain agents. However, a recent study demonstrated that the transmission of common adventitious viruses (including MPV) and pinworms to sentinels via soiled bedding did not differ according to whether the sentinels were weanlings, young adults, or aged (Grove et al., 2012).",

Clean bedding should not be placed in a sentinel cage because it further dilutes infectious agents in the soiled bedding, possibly to concentrations below the infectious dose for the sentinels (Besselsen et al., 2008a, Smith et al., 2007). The placement of new nesting material into the sentinel cage is a reasonable compromise and is recommended wherever this enrichment method is in use.

In considering methods, one must keep in mind that serology and PCR yield different information, the former simply indicating infection at some prior, undetermined time and the latter indicating the current infection or nucleic acid presence.

When the prevalence of infection is very low, as is frequently the case following contamination of rodents in microisolation cages, a substantial percentage of positive results are likely to be FP, even for assays having diagnostic accuracy (i.e., DSp and DSe) near 100% (Fig. 11.10). In addition, irrespective of diagnostic accuracy, no assay is immune to sample selection errors (Table 11.8\n) and mistakes made in the laboratory including sample mix-ups, noncompliance with SOPs, data calculation and transcription errors, incorrect interpretation of findings, and so forth. Therefore, we cannot overemphasize the importance of confirming new positive findings \u2013 even those made by direct examinations that would seem irrefutable \u2013 before undertaking disruptive and costly actions to eradicate an infection. When one considers that most programs rely on quarterly testing and an adventitious infection is likely to require at least several weeks to spread to and reach a detectable level or elicit seroconversion in sentinels, it is reasonable to expect that a period of a month or longer has elapsed between the occurrence and detection of an outbreak. Thus, taking few a more days to a week to corroborate initial findings poses little additional risk to other animals in the facility, especially if the animals are maintained in microisolation cages that provide biocontainment.",

Confirming infection of resident animals is worthwhile because sentinels may have acquired the infection from an extraneous source prior to placement, e.g., while in transit or quarantine. In addition, environmental specimens such as swabs of cages or the exhaust air dust from ventilated rack plenums or filters can be submitted for molecular testing (Jensen et al., 2013). The rule of thumb at one author\u2019s institution is that positive samples detected using commercially available antigen-coated ELISA plates are retested by IFA using cells infected with virus from different sources.

For instance, a murine rotavirus seropositive sentinel might lead to testing its cage mate by fecal PCR. A negative PCR result would not clarify the accuracy of the earlier result. This is because murine rotavirus causes an acute, self-limiting infection with shedding and transmission ceasing at some point after antibody development (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1985). More useful follow-up data could result from serologic testing of the cage mate and/or PCR on fecal pools of the relevant colony population or on IVC exhaust. In the case of an MPV seropositive sentinel whose cage mate was subsequently found to be negative by fecal PCR, additional testing would be required. MPV shedding and transmission wane after seroconversion, but viral DNA persists in selected tissues, notably mesenteric lymph node (Besselsen et al., 2007, Henderson et al., 2015, Jacoby et al., 1995, Shek et al., 1998, Smith et al., 1993a). If PCR on mesenteric lymph node yielded a negative result, one could infer that the serologic finding represented a false positive. Because MNV continues be shed at high levels in the feces of seropositive mice, negative PCR results for feces from a seropositive sentinel and/or its cage mate(s) provide significant support for the serology being FP. The patterns of infection and shedding in relation to seroconversion by immunocompetent hosts just described for murine rotavirus, MPV, and MNV are schematically depicted in Fig. 11.11A\n, B, and C, respectively.",

At academic institutions that generally provide scientists with 24/7 vivarial access, containment can be a challenge. Although investigators may view the approach as draconian, one solution is to change locks on housing rooms prior to announcing quarantine. A meeting with personnel affected by the quarantine should be scheduled as quickly as possible. During that meeting, investigators and their staffs should be informed of the facts as known at the time and the proposed management plan. Access to rooms operating under quarantine conditions should be limited to the extent possible, preferably to a single individual from each lab (often the lab manager). Breeder cages should be broken down so pups will not be delivered after a certain point in the quarantine process. Litters that are within a few days of weaning may be retained. New animals, either from approved vendors or from other locations on the campus, should never enter a room quarantined for a virus infection, thus limiting the population of susceptible animals. If investigators housing mice in the affected room(s) have standing orders with approved vendors, those orders should be cancelled for at least 90 days, allowing time for an initial 100% screen of the room plus two additional screens at 21- to 28-day intervals. A critical early step is tracking any relocations or exports that have occurred within the last 90 days prior to detection of the excluded agent. If either has occurred, the destination room(s) must be tested for \u2018collateral damage\u2019 and/or recipient institutions must be notified that the animals received may have been infected. The scientist(s) having mice in the affected room might also house mice in other rooms and/or vivaria on the campus. Rodents in those areas should also be screened since traffic patterns of laboratory staff usually cannot be easily monitored. Supplies exiting a room operating under quarantine conditions should be bagged and autoclaved to reduce chances of further spread within the vivarium. This, of course, adds substantially to the workload of husbandry staff and may necessitate overtime and, thus, increased financial burden to the animal resource. Each cage in a quarantined room is sampled (e.g., serum for serology provided the principals are immunocompetent or feces for PCR to detect enterotropic pathogens) at 3- to 4-week intervals. Two consecutive negative screens of 100% of cages in the room are required to lift quarantine. Depending on the prevalence of infection at the baseline interval \u2013 and the nature of the mice \u2013 the management approach may be test-and-cull or the room may be depopulated by a combination of culling and rederivation (Smith, 2010). As discussed earlier, rederivation can be accomplished by a variety of means and the choice may hinge on the age and fecundity of the available animals. If the infecting agent is zoonotic, the institution may very well opt for depopulation via euthanasia, decontamination, and safe disposal.",

Proper chemical disinfection following depopulation is critical to preventing the recurrence and spread of an outbreak. Consequently, the principles of effective chemical disinfection, reviewed in Section III, will be restated here. Thorough sanitization and disinfection of the affected area are necessary to prevent recurrence or spread throughout a facility. Animal areas (including shared equipment, such as anesthesia equipment or behavioral testing apparatus) should be cleaned with detergent, then, at a minimum, disinfected with compounds known to inactivate the contaminating infectious agent. General cleaning should be undertaken before disinfection or sterilization, because chemical disinfectants are inactivated by the presence of organic matter (animal room soil). Detergents are best for removing soil, whereas disinfectants and sterilants work best on clean surfaces. Sterilants will, by default, kill a broader range of organisms, and therefore are usually the best choice for general decontamination purposes. Such sterilization agents include, but are not limited to, vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide gas, and formaldehyde. A general plan, if a room has been contaminated, might consist of the following:\u25cfDepopulate the room.\u25cfDiscard any nonessential or easily replaceable equipment.\u25cfPlace any materials leaving the room in a bag; spray the outer surface of the bag with a disinfectant and then place it into a second bag outside the room. The bagged caging may then be autoclaved, cleaned, and then autoclaved again before reentering a clean room.\u25cfClean the floors, walls, and room surfaces thoroughly with a detergent solution and then rinse.\u25cfAfter rinsing, apply an aqueous-based disinfectant as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (concentration, time, temperature, humidity, etc.).\u25cfRinse again.\u25cfApply at least one other aqueous-based disinfectant (with a different mode of action than the first). Many facilities will go further and use a sterilant such as vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide or chlorine dioxide.\n",

In all cases, steps should be taken to ensure that the likely sources of infection are adequately disinfected or eliminated. The postquarantine process should include encouraging investigators to cryopreserve unique genotypes. This ensures that unique strains will not be lost in future outbreaks or disasters such as floods or prolonged power outages. This strategy can have the added benefit of reducing per diems for on-the-shelf animals that are less frequently needed for experiments. It also conserves cage space, which is an advantage for the animal resource and colleagues who may need additional space.",

In many cases, that question remains unanswered. Nevertheless, systematically investigating the potential direct and indirect sources of contamination discussed in Section III often reveals procedural or engineering gaps that can be easily closed to reduce the chance that outbreaks will recur. A few of the possibilities are noncompliance with SOPs for animal importation and on-campus relocations; noncompliance with human traffic flow SOPs; improper disinfection of supplies; failure by animal resource to calibrate and maintain equipment; improper use of PPE; improper storage of diet or other supplies used by investigators; improper handling of cages by lab staff (opening cages outside a laminar flow hood); home maintenance of reptiles or rodents by staff members; and injection of biological products that have not been tested for adventitious agents. The advent of bar-coded cage cards has permitted much improved on-campus tracking of cages that have relocated. Vivaria should also have the capacity to store experimental diets so that investigators do not keep these in the lab which may have less rigorous pest control practices than the vivarial space.",
