They are highly conserved from bacteria to humans and play important roles in all biological steps of RNA, such as RNA transcription, splicing, transport and decay, ribosome assembly and translation (Gustafson and Wessel, 2010, Lee et al., 2008). DDX5, one of the cellular DEAD helicase, acts as an important co-activator for a range of transcription factors (Endoh et al., 1999, Fuller-pace and Ali, 2008, Steimer and Klostermeier, 2012). Moreover, DDX5 has been shown to be recruited to the promoters of responsive genes when these transcription factors are activated, consistent with its role in transcription initiation (Clark et al., 2008).",

DDX5 attracts great interests in antiviral researches because several studies showed it is involved in the replication of several viruses such as HIV-1 (Zhou et al., 2013), SARS-CoV, influenza virus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Chen et al., 2009, Goh et al., 2004). DDX5 interacts with SARS-CoV helicase and SARS-CoV replication is significantly inhibited when expression of DDX5 was silenced by small interfering RNA (Chen et al., 2009). DDX5 also colocalizes with influenza virus RNP in the nucleus and interacts with influenza virus polymerase (Bortz et al., 2011). HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase can interact with DDX5 and transient expression of RdRp causes the redistribution of endogenous DDX5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Goh et al., 2004).",

DDX5 can bind to the JEV 3\u2032 UTR and colocalizes with viral RNA. Finally we used a JEV replicon system to confirm that DDX5 plays an important role in JEV RNA replication.",

To address this issue, we next examined the influence of RNA or DNA on the interaction between JEV core, NS3, NS5-MTase, NS5-RdRp and DDX5. The co-immunoprecipitation was performed following RNase and DNase treatment. The results showed JEV core, NS3, NS5-MTase, NS5-RdRp and DDX5 interaction was also detected after RNase (100 \u03bcg/ml) and DNase (100 \u03bcg/ml) treatment, suggesting that the interaction between JEV proteins and DDX5 were not mediated by RNA or DNA(Fig. 4D).",

The glutathione-Sparse 4B beads were first incubated with the GST-DDX5. After unbound GST-DDX5 protein was washed away, JEV core, NS3 or NS5 (MTase or RdRp domains) was mixed with the beads. The various amount of other viral protein was further incubated with the beads to compete the bound viral protein from DDX5. The results showed the JEV core protein bound with DDX5 decreased gradually when the mixture was incubated with increasing amount of NS3. Meanwhile, the amount of core protein in the supernatant increased (Fig. 5\nA). The similar results were observed when use NS5-RdRp to compete the core protein (Fig. 5B), NS5-MTase could not compete with core protein (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, NS3 could be pulled down from DDX5 by NS5-MTase protein (Fig. 5D), but not by NS5-RdRp (Fig. 5E). NS5-MTase could not be pulled down from DDX5 by NS5-RdRp (Fig. 5F). The analysis of the proteins in the supernatant was consistent with the results on the beads. Therefore, the results suggested that interaction site of core/NS3, core/NS5-RdRp or NS3/NS5-MTase on DDX5 might be close to each other, while the interaction site of NS5-MTase/core, NS3/NS5-RdRp or NS5-MTase/NS5-RdRp on DDX5 is not. Meanwhile, all the purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. S1).",

To investigate if the recruitment of DDX5 to the cytoplasm is necessary for JEV replication, we used leptomycin B (LMB, 5 ng/ml) to inhibit nuclear export of DDX5 (Wang et al., 2009a) at 0 h post-infection (MOI = 0.01), 24 h later, Confocal microscopy analysis showed that DDX5 was not recruited to the cytoplasm during JEV infection after LMB treatment (Fig. 6A). In the meantime, we determined the effect of LMB treatment on JEV infection, 5 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml LMB was added to the cell at 0 h post-infection, the virus titers was detected 2 days later by plaque assay. The results showed that LMB can significant inhibit JEV infection compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 6B), confirming that it is need to recruit DDX5 to the cytoplasm to participate in JEV replication.

We constructed a luciferase-containing JEV replicon according to the previous study (Chien et al., 2011). BHK-21 cells were first transfected with DDX5i shRNA plasmid to knockdown the expression of DDX5, the non-targeting shRNA was used as the control. The cells were then transfected with in vitro-transcribed luciferase-containing JEV-replicon RNA and firefly luciferase RNA as the internal control. The cells were harvested for dual luciferase assays at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post transfection. The results showed that there were two peaks of replicon luciferase activity corresponding to the first translation and the second replication peak (Fig. 9\nA). The luciferase activities were nearly the same in the DDX5i and control treated BHK-21 cells in the first peak, while luciferase activities were lower for all of the time points in the DDX5i treated BHK-21 cells in the second peak. The data showed that viral RNA replication, but not the viral protein translation, was hampered by DDX5 knockdown. Meanwhile, the luciferase activity derived from a control reporter, Renilla luciferase flanked by cellular GAPDH 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs did not significantly changed between the shDDX5 and control treated cells (Fig. 9B), which means that the translation of cellular protein was not hampered by DDX5 knockdown. Collectively, our results strongly suggested that DDX5 is involved in viral RNA replication by binding to JEV 3\u2032 UTR.",

However, viral resistance to antiviral agents has been a problem. One possible solution to overcome this problem is to target host cellular factors important for the viral life cycle. DDX5 plays important roles in many virus, such as SARS-CoV, influenza virus and HCV (Chen et al., 2009, Goh et al., 2004), and other cellular helicases such as DDX3, DDX1, DDX56 are also involved in many virus replication and the assembly of virions (Xu et al., 2011, Xu and Hobman, 2012). Two studies reported novel DDX3 inhibitors against HIV infection (Maga et al., 2011, Radi et al., 2012). Therefore, the cellular helicases have been proposed as a promising target to design novel agents to control viral infection that poses major global health threats (Geiss et al., 2009, Kwong et al., 2005, Stankiewicz-Drogo\u0144 et al., 2010).",

By using GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that DDX5 can interact with JEV core, NS3, NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp, suggesting that DDX5 might act as a cofactor for JEV proteins in virus replication. It has been suggested that cellular proteins can bind to viral 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 UTR to modulate viral translation and/or replication (Chen et al., 1997). Our studies showed that DDX5 can only interact with viral 3\u2032 UTR and colocalize with viral RNA. We further confirmed that DDX5 plays an important role in virus RNA replication but not in viral protein translation, which is consistent with its ability to bind to viral 3\u2032 UTR. We performed the competition binding studies to map the interaction interfaces between DDX5 and viral proteins. The viral RNA replication is a quite dynamic process, and other host factors are also recruited by the viral proteins to facilitate this process (Lindenbach et al., 2005, Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003a). We suspected that the interaction interfaces shown in our competition binding studies might not always exist during viral RNA replication.",

The host nucleus proteins could be recruited to cytoplasm to facilitate flaviviruses replication (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003b, Zebovitz et al., 1974). It has been reported that DDX5 is redistributed into the cytoplasm during HCV infection (Goh et al., 2004). Consistent with this, our study showed that DDX5 might be recruited to the cytoplasm and colocalize with the JEV core, NS3 and NS5 and viral RNA during the infection to facilitate the unwinding the intermediate RNA duplexes. Since LMB can inhibit all the CRM1-mediated export of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Wang et al., 2009a), we cannot rule out the trafficking of other cellular proteins inhibited by LMB which might also be important for virus replication. Our result showed that virus can still replicate at low titers after LMB treatment. Considering that DDX5 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasma, we speculated the small amount of DDX5 resides in cytoplasma after LMB treatment still exerts its role in virus replication. Meanwhile, it is also possible that DDX5 is only used to increase the efficiency of RNA separation so that the viral RdRp can transcribe viral RNA more efficiently during virus replication.",
