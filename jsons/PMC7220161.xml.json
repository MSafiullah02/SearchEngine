To put this into perspective, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have legal powers and cover a greater range of public health areas through bodies such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health or the National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC also has a much larger budget than the ECDC (approximately US$8 billion for 2020,2 whereas the ECDC received \u20ac60 million3) and staff (10 796 employees in 2018,4 whereas the ECDC employed 271 people that year5).",

Such a quick escalation became an obstacle to coordination at the EU level\u2014a scenario where the ECDC could have been called to have a more active role, on behalf of the European Commission and the member states. The lack of coordination at the EU level became even more evident when national leaders sought to legitimise their decisions by giving voice to national experts, in the absence of multinational meta-analytical infrastructure or supranational coordination mechanisms, or even coherent systems for sharing procedures and protocols. The European Commission advisory panel on COVID-19 was set up by the EU member states as late as March 16, 2020.9\n",
