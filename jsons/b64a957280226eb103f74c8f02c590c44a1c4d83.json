Both types of fusion proteins exhibit a distinct functional organization, which is reflected by their different spatial orientations. Thus, class I fusion proteins are oriented perpendicular to the cellular membrane and are visible as spikes in electron micrographs, while class II proteins are oriented horizontally relative to the cellular membrane and are well ordered on the virion surface. Viral class I fusion proteins are organized into a globular surface unit (SU), which interacts with cellular receptors, and a transmembrane unit (TM), which harbors highly conserved sequence elements required for membrane fusion. 3 Membrane fusion is initiated by binding of SU to cellular receptor(s) or by exposure of the glycoprotein to low pH, which triggers conformational changes in the glycoprotein that activate TM. TM-driven membrane fusion is initiated by insertion of a N-terminal fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, followed by conformational changes in TM during which two heptad repeats in the extracellular part of TM fold back onto each other and pull the viral and target cell membranes into close contact, which ultimately promotes membrane fusion. Despite the different functional organization of class II fusion proteins, which, e.g., harbor the fusion peptide in SU, membrane fusion driven by these proteins follows similar principles. 5 The S-proteins of CoVs, which protrude from the viral membrane and provide virus particles with the typical corona like shape, exhibit the characteristics of class I fusion proteins. 1 Some S-proteins are cleaved between S1 and S2, 1 as is the case with human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and cleavage is possibly important for function. In contrast, cleavage of the spike proteins of HCoV-229 and other group I CoVs has not been observed and cleavage of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S appears to be cell-type dependent and not essential for function. 1 The S1 domains are adapted to bind to specific cellular receptors, and the spike-receptor interaction is the major determinant of viral cell tropism. 1 Because the S-proteins of CoVs from different groups are, in most cases, adapted to interact with different receptors, they show little sequence conservation. In contrast, the S2 domains share the same task, fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and therefore exhibit considerable sequence homology. 1 infected individuals. 6 In contrast, infection with HCoV-NL63 does not cause severe disease, but is often associated with bronchiolitis and cold like symptoms. 7, 8 Although SARS-CoV was, mainly due to air travel, spread into 29 different countries in 2003, the majority of cases were observed in Asia.

Our analysis, and its comparison with independent studies using replication competent CoVs, show that S-protein bearing pseudotypes adequately reflect cell tropism, receptor and attachment factor usage and route of entry of the CoVs from which the S-proteins were derived. We found that SARS-CoV-S bearing pseudotypes infect a relatively broad range of cells, 10 leading us to the conclusion that SARS-CoV might target organs other than the lung in infected patients. Indeed, subsequent studies examining tissues from SARS patients confirmed that SARS-CoV targets a variety of organs. 11 Entry of SARS-CoV-S pseudotypes 10,13,14 and replication competent virus 25 can be inhibited by compounds that impede acidification of the endosomal compartment, suggesting that low pH might trigger structural rearrangements in SARS-CoV-S pivotal to membrane fusion. However, a subsequent study revealed that an acidic environment is required for the activity of cellular cathepsin proteases, which cleave the SARS-CoV-S, and possibly the NL63-S-protein, and cleavage was found to be required for infectious cellular entry. 25 Thus, SARS-CoV-S dependent entry follows a novel principle, and offers new targets for therapeutic intervention. 25 Entry of SARS-CoV was strictly dependent on expression of ACE2, 16 indicating that ACE2 is the only cellular receptor for SARS-CoV. The ACE2 ectodomain was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-S dependent entry 16 and it might be possible to generate ACE2 derived inhibitors. Compounds based on the ACE2 ectodomain might be particularly promising, as it has been proposed that downmodulation of ACE2 during SARS-CoV infection is responsible for much of the SARS pathology, which can be prevented by application of the soluble ACE2 ectodomain. 26 While ACE2 promotes entry of SARS-CoV, viral entry is enhanced by S-protein binding to the lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. 14, 22 Our studies indicate that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR augment infection but do not allow for infectious entry in the absence of ACE2. 10 However, another study employing replication competent SARS-CoV reported that DC-SIGNR functions as a viral receptor. 23 In any case, it will be interesting to analyze if polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR neck region, which are frequently found, modulate the risk or outcome of SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV shares ACE2 as a receptor and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR as attachment factors with the group I HCoV-NL63. 24 The observation that HCoV-NL63 employs ACE2 for infection and consequently enters the same target cells as SARS-CoV, but does not induce severe disease, poses a variety of interesting questions. Are the accessory genes responsible of these differences in pathogenicity, nine of which are present in SARS-CoV compared with only one in NL63? Do SARS-CoV-S and NL63-S engage ACE2 differentially, and are potential differences associated with differences in pathogenicity? Is HCoV-NL63-S sensitive to ACE2 inhibitors? Can a chimeric NL63-S/229E-S protein be generated that induces neutralizing antibodies against both viruses and can be developed as a vaccine? Is ACE2 the only receptor for HCoV-NL63? While experiments with transiently transfected non permissive HeLa cells indeed suggest that HCoV-NL63 could use a coreceptor for entry (data not shown), a thorough comparative analysis of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infectious entry, including the establishment of animal models for HCoV-NL63 infection, is required to answer these questions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 673, "end": 675, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 749, "end": 751, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1202, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1318, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1385, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1521, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1853, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1978, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1981, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2111, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2232, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2512, "end": 2514, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUDING REMARKS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Cellular entry of the SARS coronavirus", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Hofmann", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "P\u00f6hlmann", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Trends Microbiol", "volume": "12", "issn": "", "pages": "466--472", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "How viruses enter animal cells", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Smith", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Helenius", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Science", "volume": "304", "issn": "", "pages": "237--242", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Mechanisms of viral membrane fusion and its inhibition", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Eckert", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Kim", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Annu.
