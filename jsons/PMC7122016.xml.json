It is an antigen-encoding bacterial plasmid that produces an immune response when inoculated into a suitable host (Garmory et al. 2003; Josefsberg and Barry 2012). Potential applications of plasmid DNA and other gene therapy approaches have been a matter of debate for a long time (Wolff et al. 1990). DNA vaccination elicits neutralizing antibodies and induces T helper cell response of Th1 phenotype and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response (Donnelly et al. 1997).",

These two responses are so critical that also known DNA vaccines can induce long-term immunity in many diseases. This has become a requirement for vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccines are easy to produce and purify, and this has enabled the production and evaluation of new DNA vaccines in animal models within months. Another advantage is the long shelf life of DNA vaccines and the capability to transport (no need to cold chain). Various studies, including on humans, show the reliability of DNA vaccines (Bagarazzi et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2001). DNA vaccinations have proved in rodents as efficient. Studies on DNA vaccination are continued even in outbred species (Carvalho et al. 2009; Redding and Weiner 2009). Currently, four DNA vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use. One is for swine in Australia, for growth of hormone releasing hormone, the other is against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus for salmon in Canada, and the others are against west nile virus (WNV) for horses and melanoma for dogs in the USA (Kutzler and Weiner 2008).",
