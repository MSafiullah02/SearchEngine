            "text": "The interrelationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is likely complex. Smoking may increase ACE2, the receptor for SARS-Co-V-2 2 thereby increasing disease risk; however cigarette smoking has also been shown to downregulate ACE2 3 , thereby possibly reducing such risk. An analysis of 5 studies reporting patient smoking status determined that, relative to the population of smokers in China, current smokers were underrepresented in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 by, in some cases, a factor of 10 4 . A pre-print review article, while concluding that smoking increased severity of COVID-19 progression, reported underrepresentation of smokers in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients, relative to the smoking populations in China, Korea, and USA 4 . Although there are many possible explanations for these findings, together these results nevertheless suggest a protective effect of smoking on susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Given that there are now widely accessible data bases from multiple countries with demographic data that includes smoking status, it is possible, and incumbent upon us, to empirically examine the relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. Whether or not we approve of the results from a societal or public policy perspective is beside the point. This is especially true when we consider that the goal of all such research is ultimately to protect public health within the immediate context of this pandemic, as well in the longer term.",
