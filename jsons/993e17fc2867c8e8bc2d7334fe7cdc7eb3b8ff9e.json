Brain peptidases participate in the general metabolism of peptides (proteins). In addition, they are possibly involved in neurotransmission. The neuropeptidases that have been actively studied in the last 15 years are emphasized here. For the other peptidases, please refer to the author's former review (Hui and Lajtha, 1983) . Neuropeptides play important roles in mental and neurological diseases Widerlov, 1988, 1990; Wahlestedt et al., 1989) . They are widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system, where they serve as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Deficiency of neuropeptides, for example, ACTH, can cause various neurological signs (Sato et al., 1991) . The neurophysiological abnormalities include slow wave activity on electroencephalograms, delayed conduction velocity of the peripheral nerves, and low amplitude of muscle action potentials. Recent interest has focused on the role of neuropeptides in degenerative neurological diseases. Understanding this role could help define what is specifically vulnerable to the pathological processes, thus leading to improvement in diagnosis and therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 482, "end": 504, "text": "(Hui and Lajtha, 1983)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 578, "end": 599, "text": "Widerlov, 1988, 1990;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 600, "end": 624, "text": "Wahlestedt et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 866, "end": 885, "text": "(Sato et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Abnormalities of Neuropeptides and Neuropeptidases", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2"}, {"text": "In the CNS, neuropeptides are co-stored with catecholamines, especially norepinephrine (NE).

The blood-borne Enks indicate that some peptide receptors are distant from the synapses. During their travel, attack by peptidases is unavoidable. Recent findings indicate that the pharmacological effects of puromycin, bestatin, and thiorphan are due to their protection of Enk from destruction before its receptor binding and their inhibition of the postsynaptic peptidases . Bestatin and thiorphan increase the release of Enk by K \u00fe stimulation (Patey et al., 1981) indicating that peptidase inhibitors play a major regulatory role in the process. The physiological function of insulin is controlled by degradation in its releasing neuron (Halban, 1980) . The presynaptic regulation allows the neurons to store releasable peptide that is relatively independent of axoplasmic transport. It is believed that Enks and neurotransmitters alike are constantly released at basal levels, which increase with stimulation. They are continuously produced at a high level and are degraded after production, with degradation being inhibited during stimulation of release. The inhibitor is released together with Enks into the synaptic cleft. Indeed, Enk is co-released with the peptide (Winkler et al., 1987) .
