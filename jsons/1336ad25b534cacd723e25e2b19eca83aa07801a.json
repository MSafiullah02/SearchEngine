This global response has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus, yet without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology. To make this resource available to the research community and facilitate its exploration and analysis, we also implemented a web application and released the KG in multiple standard formats.",

The process of discriminating \"known knowns\" from \"unknown knowns\" can be supported by knowledge graphs (KGs), as they provide a means to capture, represent and formalize structured information (Nelson et al., 2019) . Furthermore, although these KGs were originally developed to describe interactions between entities, they are complemented by a broad range of algorithms that have been proven to partially automate the process of knowledge discovery (Cowen et al. , 2017; Humayun et al., 2020) . Importantly, novel machine learning techniques can generate latent, low-dimensional representations of the KG which can then be utilized for downstream tasks such as clustering or classification (Hamilton et al ., 2015) .",
