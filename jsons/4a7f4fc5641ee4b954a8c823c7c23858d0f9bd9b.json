Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 . Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of selfisolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.",

An estimated 792,417 hospital beds are available in the United States, of which 97,776 are within ICUs (6) . These resources are limited and usually function at more than half capacity outside public health emergencies (7) . Previous estimates indicate that 65% of hospital beds (7) and ICU beds (8) are routinely occupied, absent a public health emergency. This translates to 277,346 typically unoccupied hospital beds and 34,222 unoccupied ICU beds. COVID-19 could overwhelm this limited resource.

In this study, we projected the COVID-19-associated demand for hospital and ICU beds within the United States. To this end, we developed an age-structured dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, parameterized with the US population demographics and latest estimates from global COVID-19 outbreaks (SI Appendix, Table A5 ). We simulated disease spread under a range of scenarios for self-isolation, whereby symptomatic individuals reduce their contacts within the community by staying at home. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak will most likely overwhelm current hospital capacity and that expanding the number of ICU beds is an urgent imperative.",

Adequate ICU capacity is crucial to save the lives of severe COVID-19 cases. Our projections indicate that COVID-19 will overwhelm hospital capacity in the United States at the peak of the outbreak. A similar demand was experienced during the initial wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as well as the 2003 SARS epidemic in some population settings (10) . In these instances, the critical care facilities were compromised by the surge of cases. Consistent with advice from the CDC, our results indicate that early identification of symptomatic cases combined with timely self-isolation can dramatically reduce the demand for hospital and ICU beds. However, self-isolation alone is unlikely to be sufficient for keeping peak ICU demand below the typically available capacity. With an R 0 of 2.5, we estimated that about 85% of mildly symptomatic individuals would need to self-isolate within 24 h to avoid exceeding typically available critical care capacity.

We have focused on the role of self-isolation to slow the epidemic and enable the healthcare system to manage critical care of symptomatic patients and continue non-COVID-19 healthcare activities. Yet self-isolation should be seen within the broader framework of nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce infectious contacts, including a range of social-distancing policies. Our model does not incorporate socialdistancing policies other than self-isolation for lack of adequate parametrization of their effects, yet there could well be important synergies between self-isolation and other social-distancing policies. In the current crisis, China has deployed a range of socialdistancing policies (14) , and globally, school closures have been widely adopted [in 13 countries affecting 292 million school children as of March 4, 2020 (15) ]. In the context of respiratory infections (e.g., influenza), school closure has been shown to reduce visits to the emergency department at the hospitals and slow the progression of the outbreak (16, 17). However, assessing the effectiveness of school closures is challenging, as it may depend on the population setting and the time of implementation (16). Limiting public transportation would also reduce the number of contacts with infectious cases, particularly those with mild symptoms, and therefore impede the spatial spread of the disease. However, this approach requires careful evaluation before implementation as it may indirectly affect access to healthcare and other essential services (18, 19) .",

Newly infected individuals entered an incubation period for an average of 5.2 d before becoming symptomatic (SI Appendix, Table A5 ). Combining with the estimated average of 7.5 d for the serial interval (27), we calculated an average infectious period of 4.6 d, during which individuals were concurrently symptomatic. Symptomatic cases had an age-dependent probability of developing mild, severe, or critical illness. We assumed that patients exhibiting mild symptoms recover without hospitalization, while severe and critical cases had an age-dependent probability of non-ICU and ICU hospital admissions, respectively.
