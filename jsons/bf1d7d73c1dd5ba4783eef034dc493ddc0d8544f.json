Despite all intentions and efforts to build enough ventilators to face these needs, it will likely be impossible to produce enough units to meet the demand of the next few weeks if not months. Now is the time to find an ''out of the box'' and pragmatic solution to get over this crisis and the shortcomings of the healthcare system and shortages of therapeutic equipment. The solution proposed herewith is based on lessons provided by the history of anesthesia. While we see many comparisons of the current COVID-19 pandemic with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, I believe that the lessons learned from the 1952 polio pandemic are even more appropriate to help us in the current crisis.",

A huge number of cases (n = 5,722) were registered in the country, and 2,450 patients were faced with lifethreatening respiratory paralysis. 1 In the first four months of the epidemic, the Belgrams Hospital of Copenhagen had to treat three times as many patients with respiratory failure than it had in the previous ten years. The Danish healthcare system was overwhelmed. In the first six weeks of the epidemic, 27 of 31 patients with respiratory insufficiency died. That crisis is reminiscent of the current COVID-19 concerns in our hospitals today.",

Improvisation and pragmatism became the only way out of the nightmare. After attending to a child that had been left to die by his colleagues, just as so many others had not been able to be saved, the successful treatment method that he designed for that child was henceforth instituted for all patients with similar medical conditions. 1 Patients with respiratory insufficiency were tracheostomized, and continuously manually ventilated with supplemental oxygen by an attendant caretaker.",

Samson, MD (&) Ottawa, ON, Canada e-mail: Bensam64@hotmail.com new problem that also had to be solved pragmatically. A large number of patients admitted to these wards met the criteria of Dr. Ibsen to be treated with tracheostomies and manual ventilation by an attendant. The non-availability of enough medical staff to manually ventilate all those patients became the new challenge. Ibsen convinced the authorities to recruit all the medical students of Denmark and have them come to the rescue. These newly appointed care givers received a brief introduction in the method of manual ventilation. They then sat for six-hour shifts at the bedside of the patients to ventilate them and suction their lungs when needed. Over 250 medical students and 260 nurses were enrolled to provide this care to those patients. 1 At the height of the epidemic, 75 patients were manually ventilated. The mortality from respiratory failure in polio patients was thus reduced from 90% to 15%. Dr. Ibsen referred to these healthcare workers as ''piecework anesthetists''. 1",

Just as in 1953, doctors would then be ''in the intolerable situation\u2026of having to choose which patients to treat and which not to treat''. 2 A pragmatic solution learned from the lessons of the polio epidemic of 1953 in Denmark is available. We need ''piecework living ventilators''. If, as some epidemiologists believe, individuals exposed to COVID-19 are ''vaccinated'' against a subsequent infection by the virus, there will be soon an army of volunteers protected against COVID-19 re-infection that could be rapidly trained to ventilate patients manually. It is relatively easy to learn how to manually ventilate an intubated patient. Even though the quality of their ventilation may not be perfect, it would be 100% better than no ventilation. Fortunately, it appears that the younger generation is being relatively spared from the most severe effects of COVID-19. There will soon be enough volunteers to fill two-hour shifts for ventilating patients when and/or where ventilators are not available. The risks of re-infection for those with demonstrated antibodies against COVID-19 will need to be evaluated and they will still need appropriate personal protective equipment.",
