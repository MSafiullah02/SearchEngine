A great body of scientific evidence has contributed to establish a positive correlation between a physically active lifestyle and health benefits [1]. According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, individuals affected by chronic diseases should practice a minimum of 150 min per week of moderate-intensity exercise, or at least 75 min per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity to improve health [2]. Additional health benefits can also be promoted by performing muscle-strengthening activities involving all main muscle groups at least twice a week [2].",

In general repeated moderate intensity exercise enhances the immune function response, reinforces the antioxidative capacity, reduces oxidative stress, and increases the efficiency of energy generation, therefore reducing the incidence of inflammatory diseases [6,7]. Acute bouts of physical exercise also regulate the immune response, i.e. by transiently redistributing immune cells to peripheral tissues, resulting in a heightened state of immunocompetence [8].",

            "text": "Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system that prevents, limits, and repairs damage by invading pathogens or endogenous biomolecules. Although acute inflammation is a transient inflammatory response and is beneficial to the organism, a persitent inflammatory response is associated with tissue dysfunction and pathology [9]. Examples of chronic non-communicable diseases with inflammation as a physiopathological key component are obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, asthma, dementia and neurodegenerative diseases [6,[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a communicable disease responsible for the ongoing global pandemic [17]. Recent evidence has demonstrated that COVID-19 impairs the immune system response by inducing leukopenia with increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, this immune dysregulation might have a fatal outcome mainly in individuals with pre-existing medical conditions and in elderly patients in whom a chronic inflammation status is expected [18,19]. In this scenario, it has been shown that physical exercise improves overall health and reduces all-cause mortality risk (for a revision see ref. [20]). Indeed, the practice of physical exercise helps to manage T2DM [21], lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart attacks, hypertension and stroke [12], reduce risk of developing breast and colon cancer [22], protect from accelerated cognitive decline [23,24], and enhance immune responses to pathogens and vaccinations [8,25].",

Chronic physical exercise can guide the immune system response by favoring an anti-inflammatory status, which appears to be the key factor in improving health, mainly in chronic diseases [6]. In this review, we highlight the main findings in the literature on the (i) beneficial effect of physical exercise on the antioxidant system, on neurotrophic factors and on the microglia phenotype to promote neuroprotection; (ii) anti-inflammatory effect of the regular practice of moderate-intensity physical exercise on communicable and chronic non-communicable diseases, and finally we suggest (iii) the use of immune system activation biomarkers to follow the anti-inflammatory effects of physical exercise.",

Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles, which results in energy expenditure above resting levels [27]. Examples of physical activity includes occupational activities (e.g., work, domestic cleaning), transport (e.g., walking or cycling to work) and leisure-time activities (e.g., playing, dancing) [27]. When physical activity is planned, structured, and repetitive and has as a final or intermediate objective the improvement or maintenance of physical fitness, it is defined as physical exercise [27] (the definition of the main terms related to exercise are presented in Table 1\n). Exercise bouts disrupt bodily homeostasis by provoking perturbations in different cells, tissues, and organs and thus increasing body's metabolic activity. The contracting skeletal muscles engaged in exercise consequently increase muscle energy and oxygen demands [27,28].",

            "text": "The practice of physical exercise can elicit acute or chronic biochemical and physiological responses based on the exercise frequency, volume and intensity (Fig. 1). Acute physiological responses are associated, for example, with the immediate effects of a single bout of exercise, which induce alterations in the homeostasis of the whole body, e.g., increase in the heart rate, transient tissue redistribution of immune cells [[30], [31], [32]]. Physical activity and physical exercise can be both acute and chronic. When a single bout of exercise (acute physical exercise) is repeated over time it becomes a chronic exercise, which can also be defined as exercise training [30,33]. The intensity of exercise determines the overall physiological responses to exercise training (see the classification of physical exercise intensities in Table 2\n), and it is typically expressed as a percentage of the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of the individual. [1,28]. VO2max represents the maximum aerobic capacity and high energy use during exercise, and it is defined as the combined capacities of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems to deliver oxygen to skeletal muscles, and the ability of those muscles to utilize it [28]. At rest, the average of the whole-body oxygen consumption in an adult individual is about 3.5 mL/kg/min. The resting body oxygen consumption is about 20%\u201325% of this value. Endurance athletes can exceed 25 times resting values, while in untrained subjects usually does not exceed 15 times [34].",

However, if exceeded the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity, more significant improvements could be obtained in terms of quality and physical fitness [1]. On the other hand, physical exercise below a minimum intensity, will not cause changes in body homeostasis, and therefore will not stimulate biochemical and physiological adaptations favoring a healthier lifestyle [1]. Indeed, a sedentary behavior increases, for example, the risk of dementia and the development of cognitive impairment [36]. On the other hand, vigorous intensity physical exercise is usually associated to adverse cardiovascular events such as sudden cardiac death or acute myocardial infarction [1,2]. Therefore, there is a dose\u2013response relationship between physical exercise and health outcomes (Fig. 2\n). It implies that the practice of physical exercise, a free-drug treatment, takes into account the health or fitness outcome that the individual craves.",

Interactions between these components have led to the concept of the neurovascular unit, where each cell type contributes to the BBB function [60,61]. The main structures responsible for the integrity of the BBB are the tight junctions [59]. The maintenance of adherence, gap and tight junctions between the different cell types within the neurovascular unit of the BBB is essential for CNS homeostasis [59].

The BBB disruption exposes the brain to peripheral cytokines and immune cells, which subsequently activates microglial cells and changes the extracellular environment promoting neurotoxicity (see the brain resident immune cells in Table 3\n) [62]. Impaired permeability also favor the entry of plasma proteins, toxins and leukocytes, which may compromise different brain regions, resulting in motor and cognitive impairment [59,62]. This process further increases the activation of the immune system creating a vicious cycle. In this context, the anti-inflammatory effect of physical exercise could either reduce peripheral inflammation, decreasing the entry of inflammatory cells in the brain or maintaining the density of tight junctions in the BBB (for a revision see ref.

However, it has been shown that IL-6 and IL-6-induced acute phase proteins have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects when they come from skeletal muscle (myokine function), decreasing the pro-inflammatory response of the immune system [65]. This differential effect of IL-6 has been shown to be induced by physical exercise (Fig. 3\n). Muscle IL-6 production is controlled by Ca+2 and glycogen/p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) stimuli, known to be associated to muscle contraction [66]. Usually, plasma IL-6 peak occurs as soon as the physical exercise ends, returning to basal levels in a few hours after recovery [67,68]. Modest increases of IL-6 are expected after exercise of low to moderate intensity or in intermittent physical exercise protocols of a shorter duration [68]. Under long-term physical exercise (over 2.5 h; e.g. marathon runners) muscle and blood IL-6 levels increase up to 100-fold, which is accompanied by raised levels of anti-inflammatory and cytokine inhibitors such as IL-1r\u03b1 and IL-10 levels [26,55,68]. The release of these mediators by blood mononuclear cells may possibly represent a mechanisms to control exacerbated inflammation, especially in elite athlete [38,69,70].",

Adrenaline and noradrenaline are the fast-acting fight or flight hormones produced by the adrenal glands on direct signaling from the brain under a stressful stimulus. Cortisol is a steroid hormone also produced by the adrenal glands, not released instantly as adrenalin, but rather taking minutes since it involves a stepwise activation of the amygdala. Both, adrenaline and cortisol, rapidly increase during exercise and once released, adrenaline activates the sequential releases of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus, adrenocorticotropic hormone by the pituitary gland, and finally of cortisol by the adrenal glands (for revision see ref. [26,70]). The responses induced by the release of adrenaline and cortisol typically are upstream of the immune system response, and the proportion.\n",

Ex vivo experiments using blood of healthy volunteers has been shown that catecholamines are able to reduce the production of cytokines induced by LPS, e.g. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, presenting an anti-inflammatory role [81]. In addition, the increased plasma cortisol levels appears to be mediated by exercise-induced IL-6 [55] and dependent to the intensity and duration of physical exercise [70]. After long-term physical exercise the cortisol show an immunosuppressive action, since cortisol has a role in maintaining the neutrophilia and lymphopenia [26].(ii)\nPhysical exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effects on adiposity. Increased visceral adipose tissue (white adipose tissue; WAT) deposition is a risk factor for the developing of many chronic inflammatory conditions, including the pandemics of obesity, and T2DM, and the public health problems, chronic pain and cardiovascular diseases [[14], [15], [16]]. WAT is known to produce many adipokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-18, leptin and retinol-binding protein 4. Excessive WAT provokes the reduction of plasma anti-inflammatory mediators, leading to the development of a chronic low-grade systemic inflammatory state [13,82]. Immune infiltration (macrophages and T-cells) into the WAT are known to facilitate and perpetuate the inflammatory state of this endocrine tissue in obesity [13]. Abdominal adiposity is known to positively correlate with a sedentary behavior [79]. In this scenario, it is widely known that the regular practice of physical exercise decreases the activation of the immune system in the WAT and prevents the risk of diabetes. The volume of physical exercise is proportional to the induced anti-inflammatory effect, for example, the greater the volume of the training (> 45 min), the bigger is the visceral adipose tissue mass loss [79].(iii)\nIncreased production and release of anti-inflammatory myokines from contracting skeletal muscle. Contracting skeletal muscle produces myokines, such as IL-6, IL-15 and irisin, which exert beneficial effects on the adipocyte metabolism [79]. It has been demonstrated that infusion of IL-6 in healthy individuals delays gastric emptying with positive effects on postprandial glycemia [83], increases glucose uptake [84] and lipid mobilization and oxidation [85], reducing therefore the risk for metabolic disorders. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the blockage of IL-6 signaling compromised the exercise-induced reduction of WAT in obese individuals [79].\n",

Irisin has been recently shown to be linked to the exercise-induced beneficial effects in the cardiovascular, digestive, immune and adipose systems [89,91]. Moderate increased circulating irisin levels induced browning of WAT with increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), reducing obesity and insulin resistance in mice [89]. It has also been demonstrated that irisin has additional benefits by counterbalancing some of the comorbidities induced by obesity. Physical exercise-liked increased irisin in the blood and brain protects from cognitive impairment and improves memory in mice [24]. Irisin also has been correlated to bone mineral density in soccer players [92] and prevented bone loss in healthy mice [93].",

Additionally, mediators circulating in the blood released by the skeletal muscle, such as irisin, also regulate the positive effects of exercise on the CNS, stimulating BDNF expression in the mice hippocampus [24,121].

Microglial cells may support neuronal function due to the capacity to secrete anti-inflammatory mediators, facilitate phagocytosis and cell repair when required, and to scavenge ROS. Microglia is the primary immune cell in the CNS and under stress adopts a pro-inflammatory phenotype releasing, e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 [127]. In line, treadmill exercise protocol with low to moderate intensity decrease the hypothalamic microglial activation in an animal model of obesity induced by high-fat diet [128]. In addition, similar training protocol improved motor behavior and microglial activation by reducing the NOS II (nitric oxide synthase II) expression, involved in microglial oxidative burst [129]. Microglia activation has been related with reduction of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), contributing to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease [130]. In this context, the beneficial effects of physical exercise protocols, voluntary or forced, on the brain of animal models of Parkinson's disease have been widely demonstrated in the literature. Six weeks of moderate-intensity exercise on the treadmill improved dopamine metabolism in the striatum of C57BL/6 mice treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) [131]. Additionally, eight weeks of strength or running treadmill protocols were able to promote neuroprotection in striatum and hippocampus of adult male mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) [132].",

In addition, increased blood levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, e.g., IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1, with low levels of BDNF have been documented in individuals affected by depression [[134], [135], [136]]. Exercise is considered a first-line treatment in mild to moderate depression [135,137,138]. It has been shown that aerobic exercise on the treadmill significantly upregulated the expression and content of central components of the BDNF-serotonin system in different regions of the brain, e.g. cortex and hippocampus, in adult rats physically trained lifelong (from 2 to 18 months of age) [139]. In addition, BDNF released from human brain has been shown to increase with an acute bout of exercise [140,141]. Besides that, six weeks of voluntary exercise on the running wheel decrease anxiety-like behaviors and exerted antidepressant-like effects, which were accompanied by stimulated hippocampal neuroplasticity, mitochondrial activity and gene expression associated energy metabolism and BDNF regulation in C57BL/6 mice [112].",

Indeed, recently it was demonstrated that FNDC5/irisin is an essential pathway involved in synaptic plasticity and memory induced by exercise in an Alzheimer's disease experimental model using C57BL/6 mice [24]. Another important brain factor stimulated by exercise is REST ([120] and revised in [23]). REST is a master transcription factor that down-regulates genes linked to cell-death in differentiated neurons and enhances the expression of other genes that induce resistance to the ageing process and the preservation of cognitive function [23]. Our group demonstrated that experimental chronic hyperglycemia in Wistar rats provoked a marked REST reduction specifically in the hippocampus [120,142]. However, our group also demonstrated that eight weeks of voluntary physical activity increased REST expression, which was also accompanied by an increase in BDNF expression in the hippocampus of aged C57BL/6 male mice [57]. Thus, the relationship between enhanced cognition and REST expression appears to be related to the repression of cell death-associated genes, suggesting that REST might be neuroprotective [23].",

Cellular stress response represents an adaptive protective mechanism to maintain or reestablish cellular homeostasis to survive under unfavorable environmental conditions [162]. The balance between ROS generation and antioxidant system is maintained by many interplaying mechanisms, and a disbalance may determine the degree of oxidative stress [163,164]. ROS and moderate-intensity physical exercise can induce appropriate levels of eustress, an important stimulus for adaptations and health benefits induced by physical exercise [161,165]. On the other hand, the disruption of redox homeostasis will induce oxidative stress provoking deleterious effects damaging biomolecules, including lipids, proteins and DNA, leading to severe cell damage and contributing to the physiopathology of a variety of chronic pathological conditions [164,166]. In fact, decreased performance, fatigue and muscle damage have been associated with enhanced production of ROS [10,40].",

Inflammation-driven oxidative stress activates NF-\u03baB, a master transcription factor that controls the priming of inflammation and enhances oxidative metabolism [168]. This mechanism has been demonstrated in many scenarios, including in immune cells-infiltrated muscle [167,169]. Additionally, ROS production has been shown to be an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular receptor for DAMPs that promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [151]. ROS activating inflammasomes may be formed in the mitochondria and also in the cytosol by xanthine oxidase [170]. The generated of reactive species is crucial to the remodeling that occurs in skeletal muscle in response to physical exercise training. However, the changes caused by the physical exercise in the oxidative metabolism depend on the type, volume and workload of the training and are specific to each tissue [12,171]. For example, it has been shown that the inflammatory peak occurs in the muscle during the first hours after an acute bout of resistance exercise [[172], [173], [174]]. However, moderate and chronic physical exercise reduces serum prostaglandin (biomarker of inflammation) levels in humans [175].",

In the presence of ADP and Fe3+, NADPH oxidase catalyzes electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen to form radical superoxide [177]. Superoxide production is increased by NADPH oxidase during the respiratory burst, which if promptly converted into hydrogen peroxide by the dismutase superoxide, and finally into hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid by the Fenton reaction or the action of myeloperoxidase [177]. During and after submaximal physical exercise the myeloperoxidase enzyme is significantly increased [178]. In addition, ROS generation, such as hypochlorous acid, is able to inhibit ATPase activity via a modification of sulfhydryl groups on the protein in the muscle cells [179]. ROS production during high-intensity or acute physical exercise is also followed by a decrease in antioxidant system [180]. On the other hand, studies have demonstrated that endurance training favor the cellular antioxidant defenses and appropriate oxidative capacity in many tissues, such as skeletal muscle [7,38,143], the adipose tissue [181] and the brain [112,182].",

Inflammatory response has an important role in pain and nociception by sensitizing nociceptor neurons, mainly through the production of inflammatory cytokines [185]. The physiopathology of many painful diseases, such as, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases have been linked to the exacerbated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [186,187]. Inflammation-induced pain is the pain induced by tissue damage and immune system activation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have long been used to treat acute pain, and after the disease is solved the hypersensitivity typically returns to basal levels [188]. However, when inflammation is sustained, classical painkillers are not effective to resolve pain and the condition becomes chronic. Chronic pain is classified by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain that lasts or recurs for more than three months [189]. Chronic pain is characterized by its long-term nature and abnormal sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Such hypersensitivity can be expressed as hyperalgesia, an excessive reaction to normally painful input; allodynia, a painful response to normally innocuous stimuli; or spontaneous pain with no identifiable cause [189]. Chronic pain has not a safe and effective pharmacological treatment; therefore, the management of chronic pain is a major unmet clinical.",

            "text": "The relationship between the development of inflammatory and neuropathic pain with pathological BH4 production has been recently demonstrated by our group in multiple animal models of chronic pain [187,195,196]. BH4 is an essential cofactor for the enzyme activity of aromatic amino-acid hydroxylases, all nitric oxide synthase isoforms, and alkylglycerol monooxygenase [197]. BH4 intracellular levels play, therefore, a key role in various biological systems, e.g., monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis [197], cardiovascular and endothelial functions [198], the immune system activation [195] and pain thresholds [195,196,199]. The levels of BH4 are tuned and finely regulated by three metabolic pathways: de novo synthesis, recycling and the salvage pathway (see BH4 pathways in Fig. 4) [200]. The de novo pathways produce BH4 from GTP by three enzymatic steps catalyzed by the enzymes GTPCH, PTPS and sepiapterin reductase (SPR) [200]. The salvage pathway rescues metabolic intermediates of the de novo pathway to produce sepiapterin and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) to form BH4 or it directly reduces the de novo intermediate to BH4, maintaining BH4 appropriate cell concentrations, while saving ATP (in equilibrium with GTP) in energy-demanding situations like inflammation [197]. Finally, once BH4 is oxidized to BH2, during its role as an enzyme cofactor, a NADH-dependent reaction will efficiently recycles it back to BH4 [200].",

The regular practice of physical activity has been indicated to non-pharmacologically treat many painful disorders, since it had similar clinical outcomes as to the use of NSAIDS and non-narcotic analgesics [201,202]. Low-intensity aerobic physical exercise during four weeks showed to reduce neuropathic pain by decreasing mechanical hypersensitivity and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord [203]. Physically active animals (two weeks of exercise on a treadmill) with neuropathic pain show increased M2 (secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines) and less M1(secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines) polarization of macrophages at the site of the injury, while sedentary mice showed increased M1 over M2 macrophages in the sciatic nerve [204]. Moreover, the blockade of IL-10 systemically and locally in the muscle reduces the physical exercise-induced analgesic effect [205]. Regular practice of six weeks of voluntary running wheel has also shown to increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum after chronic constriction injury [206]. In addition, low-intensity aerobic exercise on the treadmill has shown to reduce IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in sciatic nerve and spinal cord in an animal model of sciatic nerve crush injury [206].",

Low-intensity exercise on the treadmill demonstrated increase serotonin levels and serotonin receptor mRNA expression, decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in the brainstem and produced analgesia after nerve injury [54]. In addition, were showed that the reduction of serotonin in the brainstem induced by tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, prevented the analgesic effect induced by physical exercise training after nerve injury [54].

Chronic physical exercise offers protection against chronic non-communicable diseases, dementia and cognitive decline, among other diseases. Regular exercise training also protects against bacteria and viruses' infections and enhance immune responses to pathogens and vaccines. This makes the physical exercise a valuable tool to prevent infectious pandemics, such as COVID-19, or non-infectious ones, such as obesity. The impact of physical exercise on tissue homeostasis provokes an adaptive response which depends on the type, duration and intensity of the stimuli. The beneficial consequences of exercise on the health outcomes involve the modulation of the immune system. A pro-inflammatory phenotype is favored by physical inactivity. Conversely, the regular practice of moderate intensity physical exercise directs the immune response to an anti-inflammatory status, that is believed to be the main desired molecular mechanism to increase the health outcomes. Thus, the preventive and/or therapeutic effect of physical exercise depends of exercise workload and dose-response relationships, which could be quantified by monitoring markers of the immune response in biological fluids. Consultation with a fitness professional can enhance adherence and prevents the risks associated with the physical exercise program. We also suggest the measurement of BH4-related metabolites in biological fluids may represent a feasible way to assess the tissue immune system status and the impact of physical exercise intervention in clinical setups on chronic inflammation.",
