Although the main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is thought to be through direct infection of macrophages and T cells, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects immune cells is not known [11]. The proposed mechanism of injury by SARS-CoV-2 includes: 1) Infection of ACE-2 expressing target cells such as immune cells; 2) Suppression of interferon-responses leading to uncontrolled viral replication; 3) Increased influx of neutrophils and macrophages with release of proinflammatory cytokines leading to lung injury; and 4) Specific Th1/Th17 activation resulting in B cell activation and further inflammatory response via antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [5].",

Ligation by peptide-loaded HLA-E induces NKG2A to transduce inhibitory signalling through 2 inhibitory immune-receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity [12]. Over-expression of NKG2A (an inhibitory receptor) on CD8+ and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls has been demonstrated recently [3]. NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8+ and NK cells, severely compromising the innate immune response [14], while blocking NKG2A on CD8+ and NK cells in cancers diminished tumor growth in several studies [15]. Binding of NKG2A to its cognate ligands inhibits the effector function of CD8+ and NK cells, while blocking NKG2A restores CD8+ T and NK cell function [14]. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides the innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD+ T and NK cells [3], culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen.",

Chloroquine is a weak base which gets trapped inside membrane bound organelles resulting in changes in their acidification process [20], potentially increasing lysosomal pH and inhibiting pH-dependent viral fusion with lysosomal enzymes and replication [20]. Furthermore, chloroquine can block clathrin-mediated endocytosis by SARS-CoV-2 [21].",

Lopinavir/ritonavir have shown anti-SARS-CoV activity in clinical trials and in vitro studies [24]. Similarly, Ribavirin a guanosine analog, which inhibits viral RNA synthesis couldower the risk of ARDS in patients with SARS-CoV [24]. Furthermore, Favipiravir; an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor has been shown to be more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19 patients with fewer side effects [25]. Another antiviral drug, Remdesivir, which has been used for treating Ebola virus infections has also been under investigation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections [25], and can block viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 even at a very low concentrations [19].",
