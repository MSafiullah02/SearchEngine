Especially during nearly two decades, China's international collaboration measured by scientific publications has been increased significantly, not only in Chinese Science and Technology Papers and Citations Database (Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2005b), but also in the Science Citation Index Expanded (Zhou & Gl\u00e4nzel, 2010). Collaboration of publication between China and the seven major industrialized countries (G7) (Canada, France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA) has also shown exponential growth (He, 2009). Such collaboration had positive effects on increasing the quantity of publication in China (Cho, Hu, & Liu, 2010). While collaboration, in the form of technology acquisition could enhance the low-and-medium technology (Du & Tan, 2010), there is a question concerning China's ability to conduct independent and high quality scientific research.",

Top cited articles were also considered as \u201cclassic citations\u201d (Garfield, 1987). Various studies have attempted to identify and analyze the \u201ccitation classics\u201d, especially in medical fields, such as leading dermatologic journals (Dubin, Hafner, & Arndt, 1993), and ophthalmology journals (Ohba et al., 2007). Bibliometric method as a common research tool has been widely used to measure the scientific performance of countries, such as China (Zhang & Zhang, 1997), Croatia (Klai\u0107 & Klai\u0107, 1997), EU countries (Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2006), Japan (Fukui & Rahman, 2002), and New Zealand (Pon, Carroll, & Mcghee, 2004). Analyses usually covered the distribution of publication output, science disciplines, contributing institutions, collaboration (Jeenah and Pouris, 2008, Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2006), as well as policy implication (Uthman & Uthman, 2007). Furthermore, the citation life cycles of most cited papers with significant influence were revealed to provide more detail citation information (Fu, Wang, & Ho, 2012). In recent years, the frequency of words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus in successive sub-periods have been quantitatively analyzed to figure out the research emphases and trends (Ho et al., 2010, Li et al., 2009).",

Previous research showed that G7 countries dominated in some topics in recent decades, such as meteorology, atmospheric science, and water research (Li et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2010). In this study, China's publication output was examined in comparison with G7 countries. The annual number of articles by China and G7 countries was obtained from SCI-Expanded database of the Thomson Reuters Web of Science during 1980\u20132011. China, the United Kingdom (UK), and Germany were searched by more than one item. China, Hong Kong, and Macao were searched in terms of address for China; articles originating from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were reclassified as being from the United Kingdom (UK); and German Democratic Republic (Ger Dem Rep), Federal Republic of Germany (Fed Rep Ger), and Germany were reclassified as being from Germany.",

The data collection process of China's independent publications is illustrated in Fig. 1\n. First, China, Hong Kong, and Macao were searched in terms of address within the publication year limitation from 1980 to 2011 based on SCI-Expanded (updated on 11 July 2012). A total of 1,343,756 documents in 21 document types were therefore found. Second, only the document type of \u201carticle\u201d (1,170,899), excluding \u201cproceedings paper\u201d, \u201cbook chapter\u201d, and \u201cbook\u201d, was considered, since they represented the majority of document types that also included whole research ideas and results (Ho et al., 2010). Third, articles that have an author address from another country, other than China, were all excluded. The number of independent articles was 907,259. The total number of times an article was cited from its publication to 2011 was recorded as TC2011 (Chuang et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2011). The advantage of TC2011 is that it is an invariant parameter, thus ensuring repeatability, while the index of citation would have been updated from time to time (Fu et al., 2012). Since Garfield (1987) introduced the top cited articles as citation classics in 1987, articles that were cited at least 100 times were previously discussed as citation classics (Dubin et al., 1993, Gehanno et al., 2007, Heldwein et al., 2010, Nieri et al., 2007). As the result, 2701 articles (3.0% of 907,259 articles) qualify as top cited articles with TC2011\n \u2265 100.",

The annual production, favored categories, research emphases and trends by the frequency of keywords, the typical top articles, major individual and institutional contributors of China were presented subsequently. Publication outputs indicators, number of articles (TP) and publication share (%) as well as citation indicators, TC2011 and total TC2011 per article (C\nT\nPP) were used. Impact factor of journal, ranking, and frequency of keywords were also employed. The word share of each country was obtained by dividing number of one country's articles by the total number of articles in the world for the comparison with G7. As for the analysis of authors and institutions, more indicators were used to obtain more characteristics. Collaboration type was determined by the affiliations of the authors. (1) The term \u201csingle institution article\u201d was assigned if the researchers\u2019 affiliation were from the same institution. (2) The term \u201cinter-institutionally collaborative article\u201d was assigned if authors were from different institutions in China. (3) The term \u201cfirst author article\u201d was assigned if the first author was from the institution for analysis. (4) The term \u201ccorresponding author article\u201d was assigned if the corresponding author was from the institution for analysis. An article could either be a single institution article or inter-institutionally collaborative article.

An article might be both first author article and corresponding author article of the given institution or author, and thereby belonging to two sets of target articles. Total number of publications (TP), single institution articles (SP), inter-institutionally collaborative articles (CP), first author's articles (FP), and corresponding author's articles (RP) were examined to assess Chinese institutions and authors.",

USA was the overwhelming leader in terms of total scientific outputs. The number of articles by the USA increased from 128,059 in 1980 to 282,579 in 2011, although its world share fell from 34% in 1980 to 26% in 2011. The other six countries, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy all showed increasing trends, with the world share of 8.1%, 8.0%, 7.9%, 5.8%, 4.5%, and 3.6% in 2011, respectively. Among them, Italy had the greatest growth rate among these seven countries. Its world share climbed from the lowest world share 2.2% to 4.3%. Comparatively, China soared from 1029 in 1980 to 152,856 articles in 2011, increased by 148 times and made up about 14% of world share of articles in 2011. The great growth rate of China might be one of the reasons for the six countries of G7 decreases of world share. After Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976), scientific research papers of China grew exponentially (Frame & Narin, 1987). China's science was in a quantitative expansion phase with exponential growth (Jin & Rousseau, 2005). China's become the second since 2006 in scientific production, only behind the USA, leaving other G7 countries behind (ISTIC, 2007, ISTIC, 2011, Leydesdorff and Wagner, 2009). It is no coincidence that large funding has fueled research performance in China (Zhou & Leydesdorff, 2006). The Chinese government focused on science and technology by substantially increasing the expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP, from 0.8% in 1999 to 1.7% by 2008, according to the 2012 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators (www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei). The increase in scientific work force has also contributed a lot to this growth of science production (Mervis, 2010).",

The top cited articles has been rising steadily since 1991, reaching a peak of 318 articles in 2003, and then declined. The low level of China's output of scientific literature in 1980s was possible reflected by the Cultural Revolution (Frame & Narin, 1987). The increase of articles from 1991 to 2003 suggested that not only did China's total outputs increase, but also its production level of top cited classics has been advanced. Nearly 74% top cited articles were published in 2000s, similar to the trend of all articles, which enforces the view that China's scientific activities have been strengthened in recent years. The decline of 2003\u20132010 might be explained in part by the less time for their articles to accumulate citations (Picknett & Davis, 1999). The decline of output of top cited articles in recent years has been observed in previous studies (Fu et al., 2011, Ho, 2012a) due to time needed for citations.",

Most frequently used words in title emerged in the latest 16 years (1996\u20132003 and 2004\u20132011) provided the evidence that the China's research has been more prosperous in recent years. \u201cSynthesis\u201d (244; 9.0%), \u201ccarbon\u201d (140; 5.2%), and \u201cnanotubes\u201d (113; 4.2%) were the three most frequently used words in title. According to the results of author keywords, the 3rd position \u201ccarbon nanotubes\u201d, the \u201ccarbon\u201d and \u201cnanotubes\u201d came together as \u201ccarbon nanotubes\u201d in 78 articles\u2019 titles. Three words: \u201cnanotubes\u201d, \u201cnanoparticles\u201d, and \u201cnanowires\u201d in the top six of the words in title, two words: \u201cnanostructures\u201d and \u201ccarbon nanotubes\u201d in the top three author keywords, and the 1st place \u201cnanoparticles\u201d in the KeyWords Plus list were related to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, which suggested that China played better in this field than China's other fields, based on the active performance of its basic science. There were 262 articles with nanotubes, nanoparticles or nanowires in their titles, having 101 articles in the category of physical chemistry, 78 in multidisciplinary chemistry, and 74 in multidisciplinary materials science. The ascent of nanoscience in China has early been noticed in 2005 in Science (Bai, 2005). China's emerging presence in nanoscience was compared with France, Germany, Japan, and the USA from 1985 to 2004 (Guan & Ma, 2007), and was closing the gap with the USA during 1991\u20132005 (Kostoff, Koytcheff, & Lau, 2007). Its nanotechnology publication activity has grown exponentially at an annual rate of about 20% from 2000 to 2009 (Ye, Liu, & Porter, 2012), and has already surpassed the USA since 2009 in terms of publications outputs (Kostoff, 2012). The growth patterns of China's nanotechnology patent publications also experienced a high rate, followed far by Russia and India (Liu et al., 2009).",

As a academician of Chinese Academy of science Bai (2005) observed, when the concept of nanoscience and nanotechnology was first introduced in the 1980s, it was received favorably in China. In the 1990s, support for the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology increased substantially. It has also been reported that State Science and Technology Commission launched the nearly decade-long \u201cClimbing Up\u201d project on nanomaterial science in 1990 (Bai, 2005). From 1990 to 2002, nearly 1000 related projects (with a total funding of about $27 million) were implemented. Tens of nation-wide conferences have been held in China since 1990 covering a wide range of topics in the related fields (Bai, 2001). During this period, National Natural Science Foundation of China approved nearly 1000 grants for small-scale projects (Bai, 2005). Some achievements were obtained according to these substantial supports. Four top cited article with TC2011\n > 1000 were published in 1990s. Two independent articles without any international collaboration: \u201clarge-scale synthesis of aligned carbon nanotubes\u201d (Li et al., 1996), and \u201csynthesis of gallium nitride nanorods through a carbon nanotube-confined reaction\u201d (Han, Fan, Li, & Hu, 1997) were contributed by Chinese Academy Science and Tsinghua University, respectively. Another two international collaborative articles with TC2011\n > 1000, \u201ca chemically functionalizable nanoporous material [Cu3(TMA)2(H2O)3]n\u201d (Chui, Lo, Charmant, Orpen, & Williams, 1999), and \u201chydrogen storage in single-walled carbon nanotubes at room temperature\u201d (Liu et al., 1999) was published by the collaboration with the UK and USA, respectively. Furthermore, in 2000, National Steering Committee for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology was created to oversee national policy and coordinate action (Bai, 2005). This committee drafted the first Chinese national policy document intended to promote nanotechnology development, which was announced as the National Nanotechnology Development Strategy (2001\u20132010) (Huang & Wu, 2012). Again, the article titled \u201cpiezoelectric nanogenerators based on zinc oxide nanowire arrays\u201d (Wang & Song, 2006) with TC2011\n > 1000 was published in 2006 by Georgia Institute of Technology in USA, Peking University and National Center for Nanoscience and Technology in China.",

This article was cited 423 times in 2011, much more than other articles. The article was also the leader in terms of annual citations in 2011 in the category of chemical engineering (Ho, 2012a). Ho and McKay (1999) reviewed the use of sorbents and biosorbents to treat polluted aqueous effluents containing dyes: organics or metal, and proposed the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Since the introduction of pseudo-second-order model for the description of adsorption kinetics in 1999, it has been widely applied to the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions (Ho, 2006, Wu et al., 2009). Although the other five top articles got increasing attention after publication, the citations all had declines afterwards. Huang et al. (1988) reported that all-trans retinoic acid was an effective inducer for attaining complete remission in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Shu et al. (1988) stated that a combination of the glucose oxidase diaminobenzidine (DAB) method and the DAB nickel method could successfully bring out details of immunoreactive structures in immunostained preparations. The latest article in 2003 from Peiris provided an evidence that a virus in the coronavirus family is the causal agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al., 2003). It is also the highest cited article in the publication year of 2003 among these six top articles. SARS has become the major of health issues since its outbreak early 2003 in China. Li et al. (1996) discussed the large-scale synthesis of aligned carbon nanotubes in Science. Another article in Science, Han et al. (1997) suggested that it might be possible to synthesize other nitride nanorods through similar carbon nanotube-confined reactions. It is noticeable that four authors Zhen-yi Wang, Sishen Xie, Shoushan Fan, and Gong Ju in these four articles were academicians of Chinese Academy of Engineering or Chinese Academy of Sciences. Wang in \u201cHuang et al. (1988)\u201d has become academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1994; Sishen Xie in \u201cLi et al. (1996)\u201d and Shoushan Fan in \u201cHan et al. (1997)\u201d has become academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, and Gong Ju in \u201cShu et al. (1988)\u201d has become academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991. These four authors all became academicians after several years since the publication of the top articles, which indicated that the heavily cited articles could be considered important symbols for the evaluation of research management.",

Both the number of authors on a paper and their positions in the byline need to be taken into account accurately when measuring author contribution (Mattsson, Sundberg, & Laget, 2011). It has been accepted conventionally that the most important positions are the first and the last, whom very often is the corresponding author (Costas and Bordons, 2011, Zuckerman, 1968). The first author has actually made the most contribution, and should receive a greater proportion of the credit (Maru\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2004, Reisenberg and Lundberg, 1990). Accordingly, the non-first authors made less contribution (Shapiro, Wenger, & Shapiro, 1994). As important as the first author, another prominent authorship position is the corresponding author. The honorary authors including Nobel laureates were more likely to be listed last authors on scientific papers, rather than the first author (Bates et al., 2004, Zuckerman, 1968). The first author is commonly contributed the most, but the corresponding author obviously increases the author's credit for contributions to the study (Bhandari et al., 2004). Corresponding author was the one who contributed the most to the initial conception and supervision (Wren et al., 2007). Straight counting that accredits only the first or the corresponding author fractional counting that accredits each collaborator with partial and weighted credit might be the better choices (Huang, Lin, & Chen, 2011). Y-index (j, \u03b8) (Ho, 2012a) which takes the first author articles and corresponding author articles into consideration could provide more fair information for evaluation of Chinese institutions and authors.",

The top 20 institutions are listed in Table 4\n. The leading institution was the Chinese Academy of Sciences with j\n = 841.5 (28% of total articles). Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is the China's highest academic institution in natural sciences, with the affiliated University of Science and Technology of China and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. CAS has dominated publications with a contribution around one fourth in other studies, such as total publications in 1981\u20131985 (Arunachalam, Singh, & Sinha, 1993), and highly cited articles in 1999\u20132009 using Essential Science Indicators (Fu et al., 2011). However, a bias appeared because the Chinese Academy of Sciences has over 100 branches in different cities (Li et al., 2009). There are 113 institutions directly under CAS, including 92 research institutes (including three botanical gardens), six universities and supporting organizations (including two universities, one supporting organization, one documentation and information unit, two news and publication units), 12 management organizations that consist of the headquarters and branches, and three other units (www.cas.cn). The publications of different institutions were pooled as one heading now, and publications divided into branches would result in different rankings. Other than the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the other leading institutions were University of Hong Kong (j\n = 301.2), Chinese University of Hong Kong (j\n = 239.7), and Tsinghua University (j\n = 207.2). In addition, the 2nd position University of Hong Kong ranked 2nd in inter-institutionally collaborative articles, as well as the 2nd in the first author articles and corresponding author articles. Of the top 20 institutions, except for five universities located in Hong Kong and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the other 14 productive universities were all included in the \u201c985 Project\u201d of China. Project 985, a constructive project for founding world-class universities in the 21st century conducted by the government of China with a huge funding injection, might be a boost for the well scientific performance of these universities (Fu et al., 2011). China's research and development funding was mainly conducted in its universities (Zhou & Leydesdorff, 2006).",

            "text": "As for author analysis, 2581 articles with the information of both first author and corresponding author were evaluated by Y-index (Ho, 2012a). Fig. 6\ndisplays the distribution of the top 27 authors with j\n > 11, where the FP and RP are chosen as the x and y coordinate axes. Publication character \u03b8 could help obtain the different proportion of first author articles to corresponding author articles. Each dot was displayed with its Y-index (j, \u03b8). The authors who contributed the most were He (j\n = 33.24), followed by Li (j\n = 31.14), and Cao (j\n = 24.84). The 1st place He from Donghua University published 24 first author articles and 23 corresponding author articles, twenty of which were conducted with single author. The most cited article of He with TC2011\n = 681 was related to variational iteration method \u2013 a kind of non-linear analytical technique (He, 1999). He is the only top author who had more first author articles than corresponding author articles (\u03b8\n = 0.764). The 2nd position Li from Tsinghua University published three first author articles and 31 corresponding author articles. Li's most popular article was entitled \u201ca general strategy for nanocrystal synthesis\u201d (TC2011\n = 826) in Nature (Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2005b). The 3rd ranking Cao from Southeast University published 16 first author articles and 19 corresponding author articles. The most heavily cited article of Cao concerned about global stability conditions for delayed CNNs with TC2011\n = 251 (Cao, 2001). As constant \u03b8 is publication character, only three authors He, Ho, and Wang who had \u03b8\n < 0.7854, showing great contribution to their publications, such as conducting research and writing of the manuscript to research work (Herbertz and M\u00fcller-Hill, 1995, Reisenberg and Lundberg, 1990). Three authors Yu (j\n = 19.80), Tian (j\n = 12.73), and Liao (j\n = 11.31) had the same values of \u03b8, just on the boundary of 0.7854 line owning the same quantity first authors articles and corresponding author articles. Yu with a greater value of j published much more first and corresponding author articles than that of Tian and Liao, since j is a constant related to publication quantity. Except these six authors, 21 authors had more corresponding author articles than first author articles (\u03b8\n > 0.7854). Most top authors had more corresponding author articles than first author articles, an indication that the leading authors were more likely to be the corresponding authors than the first author. Moreover, publication character \u03b8 is an important parameter of Y-index for publication character, which is very helpful especially when j of authors is too close to distinguish the performance of authors. One group of authors with the same j was exhibited in a dash line of an arc in Fig. 6, where each dot of the line had the same distance to the original point. Five authors Wang (11.18, 0.1799), Ho (11.18, 0.1799), Sung (11.18, 1.107), Chen (11.18, 1.391), and Cheng (11.18, 1.391), had the same value of j\n = 11.18, but \u03b8 are 0.1799, 1.107, and 1.391, respectively. An investigation presented that the corresponding author usually contributed more to the initial conception and supervision, while the first author contributed more to the work performed (Wren et al., 2007). It meant that Chen and Cheng were more likely to be credited for initial conception and supervision, while Wang and Ho probably deserved more credits for the work performed. A potential bias would appear in the analysis of authorship of authors who use the same name and those who use different names in their publications. Another potential confounder arises when an author moves from one affiliation to another. It is strongly recommended that an \u201cinternational identity number\u201d for all authors when they published their first paper in a Web of Science-listed journal (Chiu & Ho, 2007).",

            "text": "By focusing on China's independent top cited articles, this research has identified the discipline strength, research hotspots, and key contributors of China without considering external roles of international collaboration. The dramatic increase of China's scientific outputs was observed, and China was ranked second, consistent with findings in previous studies (Leydesdorff and Wagner, 2009, Mervis, 2010). China's ability of publishing top cited articles has also been improving from 1991 to 2003. Furthermore, pronounced activities in chemistry and physics were observed, which is also in line with China's overall research results, such as China's all publications from 1997 to 2007 (Zhou & Gl\u00e4nzel, 2010) and China's highly cited articles from 1999 to 2009 (Fu et al., 2011). China has made dramatic strides to overtake the USA in most of the technical areas, especially in physical and engineering sciences (Kostoff, 2008). China's independent research was active in four core categories including multidisciplinary chemistry, physical chemistry, multidisciplinary materials science, and applied physics. China's research hotspots were observed to be nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanowires and nanostructures of nanoscience and nanotechnology, neural networks, ZnO, and films. Six classic articles included three in medicine, two in nanotube, and one in adsorption. Not only was China's emerging presence in nanoscience found in its independent research, but also it was in the global research (Guan and Ma, 2007, Kostoff, 2012, Kostoff et al., 2007). China has become the second largest nation in citations behind the USA during 1995\u20132006 (Leydesdorff & Wagner, 2009), and its citation counts continue to grow (Kostoff, 2012). The international scientific collaboration played a major role in this Chinese research advance (Ye et al., 2012). This study provided an evidence that in despite of the international collaboration, China's independent research in nanoscience and nanotechnology contributed a lot to its scientific performance.",
