To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",

While these last four coronaviruses are associated with mild symptoms, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome [4] , especially in elderlies, of which men, and those individuals with comorbidities and immunocompromised conditions [5] ). Although it is similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has an improved ability for pathogenicity [6] . In particular, latest evidences during the ongoing pandemic reveal that patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 can progress their clinical picture from fever, cough, ageusia and anosmia, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, or malaise to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction illness [7] . Significantly, in most critically ill patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with a severe clinical inflammatory picture based on a serious cytokine storm that is mainly characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of interleukins 6 (IL-6) [8] . In this scenario, it seems that IL-6 owns an important driving role on the cytokine storm, leading to lung damage and reduced survival [9] .",

Such a description is usually based on different observational data, previous knowledge and/or hypotheses, and is usually aggregated and rationalized into a conceptual map (i.e., a flow chart and/or a schematic disease model) that reassumes the cascade of events of the phenomenon under investigation. The conceptual map is then translated into mathematical/computational terms and then executed by computers to observe, in silico, the evolution of the phenomenon over time. Besides ABMs, other modeling techniques based on the mechanistic approach can be used. Among these, we recall, for example, ordinary and partial differential equations [34] - [36] and Petri nets [37] , [38] .",

From a computer science perspective, agents can be seen as stochastic finite-state machines, capable of assuming a limited number of discrete states. Using ABMs, the global evolution of the phenomena is observed by taking into account the sum of the individual behaviors of all agents, and sometimes unexpected \"emergent\" behaviors may be observed.",

Mammals have in fact developed an advanced immune system machinery capable to specifically recognize pathogens in order to better react against them. This advanced response is based on the ability to exactly recognize foreign proteins (i.e., epitopes) on pathogens surface by means of receptors, through a key-to-lock mechanism. While an explicit implementation would be both unfeasible and partially inaccurate from a computational point of view, in UISS we mimic such a process through the use of binary strings. Binary strings are used for both representing epitopes and immune system cells' receptors, and the probability that an immune system cell recognizes a pathogen is proportional to the Hamming distance (the number of mismatching bits) between the two strings involved into the interaction. Although this abstraction may seem binding, millions of interactions can be simulated quickly on modern computers, making easier the reproduction of many features of the immune system such as memory, specificity, tolerance and homeostasis. For example, this abstraction demonstrated able to allow the selection of the best adjuvant among a series of candidates for an influenza vaccine when properly coupled with results coming from existing binding prediction tools [28] . This suggests how such an abstraction is able to capture the complexity of the problem.",

Finally compartment assumptions have to be done to let the entities move and interact each other. In our case, we considered the lung compartment that models the main organ target of the virus and the generic lymph node that allows immune system entities to be activated and selected. Figure 1 gives a detailed sketch on the main compartments, entities and interactions. SARS-CoV-2 first entry is located in the upper respiratory tract.

The overall prediction dynamics of LEP at the injection time of 47D11 mAb (day 1) at a concentration of 10ng/ml after different SARS-CoV-2 challenge in time (panels A to F) is depicted. Specifically, one can observe the exposures at virus particles at day 7 (panel A), day 14 (panel B), month 1 (panel C), month 3 (panel D), month 6 (panel E) and after 1 year (panel F). Solid lines refer to the no-treated digital patient while dashed lines refer to mAb treated one. Blue lines depict actively infected LEP while red lines represent LEP to show the CPE. Panel A highlights that if a patient enters in contact with the virus just after 7 days post vaccination, he is fully protected from the infection (SARS-CoV-2 actively infected values of LEP are low). This is also true if a potential subject is being infected after two weeks (panel B), one month (panel C) or three months (panel D) after vaccination. Oppositely, in panel E (subject infected after 6 months) and panel F (subject infected after one year) mAb vaccination is practically ineffective in protecting the onset of the disease.",
