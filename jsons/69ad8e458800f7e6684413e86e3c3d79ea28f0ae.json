Henderson In addition to epidemiologic explanations, technical differences may explain some of the differences between the results of our study and earlier studies. The virus isolation samples were frozen at -70 ~ C within 2 hours after sampling. A blind passage was done of negative HeLa Ohio cell cultures, which increased the sensitivity of virus isolation. Furthermore, secretions were aspirated from the nasopharynx through the nostrils and a large amount of mucus was usually obtained, from which a swab was taken for virus isolation. We suggest that this collection method may have contributed to the relatively high frequency of rhinovirus infections detected.",

The markedly elevated serum transaminase values and absence of thrombocytopenia support hepatic parenchymal damage rather than consumptive coagulopathy as the cause. Coagulopathy resulting from iron-induced hepatic damage is well known. Its onset is usually delayed for at least 24 hours after iron ingestion, making the early coagulation abnormalities in patients 1 and 2 noteworthy. Both PT and activated PTT were grossly prolonged during the time of markedly elevated serum iron concentrations and minimal transaminase elevation. The coagulation measurements in patient 1 also improved coincident with a precipitous fall in serum iron concentration and prior to the onset of the hepatic coagulopathy. These observations are supported by a single case of an iron-poisoned patient in whom abrupt onset of a coagulopathy occurred within hours of iron ingestion. 2 Coagulation studies were comparable to those in patients 1 and 2, and the abnormalities were resolving by the time evidence of hepatic dysfunction appeared.",

Similar abnormalities have been demonstrated in in vitro studies in human plasma, 4a and the activated PTT prolongation was much greater than that of the PT, as in our patients 1 and 2. These effects were reversed after in vitro addition of a chelator to the test plasma. These data suggest a reversible interference with the function of Therapy for hemorrhage related to hepatotoxic coagulopathy involves coagulation factor replacement. If, however, there is functional impairment of coagulation factors because of peripheral inhibition by circulating free iron, it is unlikely the factor replacement or vitamin K would be beneficial. Thus therapy must include prompt removal of excess iron. Chelation therapy with deferoxamine is standard practice in severely iron-poisoned patients; unappreciated benefit may be the moderation of serious gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In many institutions rapid serum iron analysis is not available. This has led to the use of other factors (leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, vomiting, diarrhea, and radiographic demonstration of iron within the gastrointestinal tract) as indicators of theseverity of poisoning and the need for specific treatment. 6 If additional experience confirms the presence of an early coagulopathy in severe iron poisoning, the presence of early coagulation abnormalities could also suggest the need for deferoxamine therapy.",
