The prevalence and clinical characteristics of hMPV were determined in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children in Changsha, China. Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 1,165 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to August 2008. All PCR products were sequenced, and demographic and clinical data were collected from all patients. Seventy-six of 1,165 (6.5%) specimens were positive for hMPV, of which 85.5% (65/76) occurred in the winter and spring seasons. The hMPV coinfection rate was 57.9% (44/76), and human bocavirus was the most common virus detected in conjunction with hMPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 94.7% of the hMPV detected were of subgroup A2, 5.3% were subgroup B2, and none belonged to either the A1 or B1 subgroups. No significant differences were found in terms of the frequency of diagnosis and clinical signs between either the coand mono-infection groups, or between patients with and without underlying diseases. It was concluded that hMPV is an important viral pathogen in pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections in Changsha. Only hMPV genotypes A2 and B2 were co-circulating in this locality; human bocavirus was the most common coinfecting virus, and coinfection did not affect disease severity.",

Subsequently, hMPV was described as a cause of acute respiratory disease in many countries, including Canada, the United States, Australia, Japan, France, Hong Kong, and Korea [Ord\u00e1 s et al., 2006] . hMPV is recognized as a common cause of respiratory infections, ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to severe lower respiratory tract infection, in individuals of all ages, particularly in infants and children Freymouth et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Van Den Hoogen et al., 2003; McAdam et al., 2004; Loo et al., 2007] . However, limited data exist for hMPV infection, especially concerning its prevalence, and molecular and clinical characterizations of hMPV in children with lower respiratory tract infections in China, with the exception of a previous study in Lanzhou City [Xiao et al., 2010] .",

Human bocavirus and RSV were the most common coinfecting viruses (36.4% and 29.5%, respectively). The data regarding the impact of coinfections of human bocavirus and RSV with hMPV on disease severity are conflicting [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005; Caracciolo et al., 2008] . In this study, no significant difference in clinical symptoms, age, sex, or duration of hospital stay between the mono-and coinfection groups was detected (Table II) . Considerable evidence suggests that hMPV is responsible for both upper respiratory tract infection and lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children Freymouth et al., 2003; Van Den Hoogen et al., 2003] . Indeed, Arabpour et al. [2008] reported a higher prevalence of lower respiratory tract infection in children infected with hMPV. However, the present study encompasses only hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infection; therefore, the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infection and lower respiratory tract infection could not be elucidated. Additionally, Williams et al. [2004] reported that one-third of children with hMPVassociated lower respiratory tract infection were diagnosed with concomitant acute otitis media. However, in this study, no acute otitis media occurred in subjects who were infected with hMPV.",

These symptoms are identical to those reported in children in Canada and Korea [Chung et al., 2006; Caracciolo et al., 2008] . No significant difference was observed in the frequencies of cough, fever, respiratory crepitations, wheezing, vomiting, diarrhea, or duration of stay in hospital between the hMPV mono-and coinfection groups. More than one-half of patients with hMPV had normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein and leukocyte counts, and a majority had hepatic and renal injury. Data on whether hMPV infection can induce hepatic and renal injury are limited; therefore, this aspect requires further study. Chest radiographs of the majority of patients who were hMPV-positive showed sporadic consolidation of the lung, 21.1% (12/57) showed interstitial lung disease and emphysema, and only one patient showed consolidation in lobar distribution, pleural effusion, and single hila of pulmonary swelling, which is consistent with a report from Korea [Chung et al., 2006] .",

A significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea was observed between subjects who were hMPV-positive with and without underlying illnesses (P \u00bc 0.024), which suggests that hMPV infection may cause different clinical presentations in patients depending on the underlying conditions. However, no significant difference was detected in the detection rate, age, sex, duration of stay in hospital, the majority of clinical diagnoses, or clinical symptoms between the two groups (Table III) . These data suggest that hMPV infection did not aggravate clinical symptoms or contribute to duration of hospital stay in subjects with underlying illnesses. Three subjects had congenital heart disease, which ranked first in terms of underlying diseases. Two each had gastroesophageal reflux and measles. Further study is needed to investigate whether congenital heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or measles poses a major risk factor for hMPV infection. Previous data have suggested that the two hMPV genotypes co-circulate and that different subgroups may predominate from year to year Mackay et al., 2004] . In this study, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the simultaneous existence of two groups (A and B) and two of the four subgroups (A2 and B2). The majority of these strains (94.7%, 72/76) clustered predominantly with group A hMPV, and all belonged to subgroup A2 (100%, 72/72), which is consistent with the work of Boivin et al. [2004] . Moreover, a previous study in Lanzhou City showed that sublineages A1, A2 (A2a and A2b), and B1 cocirculated during the 2006-2007 epidemic, but only A2 circulated during the 2007-2008 epidemic [Xiao et al., 2010] . These data suggest that the circulation pattern of hMPV in China is complex, which poses a challenge for future vaccine development that relies on more molecular epidemiologic studies.",
