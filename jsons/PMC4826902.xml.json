These included all 24 countries who reported data to the WHO's FluNet in 2012 and countries that we were aware were conducting systematic hospital-based SARI surveillance (Supplementary Table 1). We requested information on all SARI cases and SARI-associated deaths detected by surveillance during 2009\u20132012. SARI case definitions used by these countries were consistent with WHO recommendations for adults and children <5 years of age [16]; however, some countries used expanded case definitions to include 14 days of symptom duration and/or physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection. WHO-recommended case definitions were updated in 2011, and many countries have recently updated SARI case definitions to reflect these recommendations. The WHO's current SARI case definition for all age groups is an acute respiratory infection with a subjective or measured temperature of \u226538\u00b0C and cough with onset in the last 10 days requiring hospitalization [17]. Variables collected in SARI surveillance included the number of subjects enrolled, the number of specimens tested for influenza virus by real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), influenza virus rRT-PCR test results, age, and outcome of hospitalization (discharge or death). We collected additional variables for SARI-associated deaths, including sex, pregnancy status, underlying medical conditions, and results of testing for other respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens or nasal aspirates were collected from enrolled SARI cases to test for influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. Except for Malawi, which conducts internal quality assurance, all countries providing data participate in the WHO's External Quality Assurance Project for influenza diagnosis. Data on Streptococcus pneumoniae from Kenya, South Africa, and Madagascar were from blood culture or blood lytA PCR and are indicative of invasive disease [18, 19]. HIV infection, tuberculosis, and other comorbid conditions were reported according to local diagnostic and surveillance practices and were not independently verified.",

Our aim was to assess the capacity of SARI surveillance to collect mortality data and provide initial insights of the characteristics of SARI and influenza-confirmed deaths, rather than to accurately document the burden of influenza-associated mortality. We found that few countries that conduct influenza surveillance are systematically collecting data on outcomes of hospitalization, and available information on deaths is sparse and incomplete. Likewise, data on the presence of comorbidities were incomplete. We also found that pregnant women were underrepresented in SARI data from all countries. We found a wide range in CFPs for SARI and influenza across countries, which may reflect differences in case definitions, criteria for hospitalization, quality of hospital care, or quality of surveillance, including proper handling of biological specimens and ascertainment of deaths. Countries where deaths are reported from sites sporadically had lower CFPs than those that reported deaths systematically, suggesting that sporadic reporting may fail to capture a large number of SARI-associated deaths. Reports of hospitalizations and deaths from low-income and middle-income settings during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic include La Reunion (255 hospitalizations and 6 deaths; CFP, 2.4%), Argentina (11 086 hospitalizations and 580 deaths; CFP, 5.2%), and Chile (1585 hospitalizations and 134 deaths; CFP, 8.5%) [20]. The majority of published data on SARI CFPs from African countries is focused on children. A meta-analysis of 11 African studies in children aged 0\u201359 months found an average in-hospital CFP of 3.9% (95% CI, 2.7%\u20135.5%) among children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections [3]. Comparison with CFP estimates among respiratory disease\u2013associated hospitalizations from the region suggests incomplete death reporting in this analysis.",

Some but not all of this difference may be explained by population demographic characteristics in Africa; >40% of the population of Africa in 2013 is <15 years of age, and just 3.4% are aged \u226565 years [24]. There may be differences in access to care among elderly persons in Africa that result in fewer elderly individuals with respiratory illness being hospitalized. Our analysis demonstrates that elderly persons who are hospitalized have a greater risk of death from respiratory disease, especially influenza, than young children. A systematic review of the case-fatality risk from the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic found significant variation in risk by age group, ranging from approximately 1 death per 100 000 symptomatic cases in children aged 0\u201319 years to approximately 1000 deaths per 100 000 symptomatic cases in persons aged \u226565 years [25]. These estimates support our finding of an increased CFP among hospitalized elderly individuals, although only 15.8% of the influenza-associated deaths reported here involved influenza A(H1N1) infections (Table 1). Despite this, children aged 0\u20134 years accounted for over one third of all SARI-associated deaths and one-third of influenza-associated deaths due to SARI in this analysis, a finding consistent with prior studies in low-income settings [3, 26]. Likewise, adults aged 18\u201349 years accounted for over one third of all SARI-associated deaths and one third of influenza-associated deaths due to SARI, which may be explained by the high prevalence of HIV in this age group.",

In South Africa, a country with systematic reporting and a relatively high CFP in this analysis, retrospective review of respiratory deaths in sentinel hospitals found that as many as 1 in 3 respiratory deaths were not enrolled in SARI surveillance [27]. Some countries in our study reported very few or no SARI-associated deaths, which limits confidence in conclusions drawn from these data. Also, substantial differences existed in how SARI, HIV status, M. tuberculosis coinfection, and other underlying medical conditions were diagnosed or defined for surveillance purposes. It is likely that very severely ill patients would not have been enrolled into surveillance, especially if informed consent was required, as was the case in several countries. This may explain why 149 of 1222 reported deaths (12%) did not have influenza virus test results. Another limitation is the ability to attribute death to any one pathogen. Although influenza viruses are less commonly found in asymptomatic persons, other viruses, such as rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, are frequently isolated from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens in asymptomatic persons, especially children [28\u201331]. The relative contribution of these pathogens to mortality may also be affected. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens may not be the ideal specimens for detecting some respiratory pathogens [32]. Also, the methods of testing for some non\u2013influenza virus pathogens differed by site. For example, South Africa diagnosed S. pneumoniae infection on the basis of lytA PCR of blood samples, while Kenya used blood cultures to diagnose invasive S. pneumoniae infection. Our study is limited in its ability to assess the true role of pathogens other than influenza virus since data on the number of cases tested for each pathogen were not available.",

Because of the logistics of specimen collection, transport, and analysis, many countries are only able to support a small number of sites, which may not be representative of the population. Limited access to care in many African settings may further reduce the number of persons hospitalized with respiratory infections, including influenza. Many cases of SARI may be due to secondary complications such as bacterial pneumonia after initial influenza virus infection, when influenza virus shedding has decreased or ceased. Moreover, influenza-associated deaths with a nonrespiratory presentation, including heart attack and stroke, are unlikely to be tested for influenza virus even if hospitalized. Many complications of influenza, especially postinfluenza pneumonia and death, happen >1 week after initial infection [33, 34] and therefore may occur at home after discharge. Vital registration data in South Africa indicate that as many as 50% of respiratory disease\u2013associated deaths occur outside of hospitals [35].",

Among those tested, respiratory viruses other than influenza virus and S. pneumoniae were commonly identified in SARI-associated deaths of all ages; however, nasopharyngeal carriage may overestimate mortality from some of these pathogens. Surveillance in antenatal clinics and/or maternity wards should be strengthened to better capture pregnant women, given the WHO's recent decision to prioritize them for influenza vaccination [40]. Sentinel surveillance may provide some information on characteristics of influenza-associated deaths but will likely underestimate influenza-associated mortality. Alternative methods should be used to estimate influenza-associated mortality in Africa, depending on the availability of vital statistics, accurate hospitalization data, and other forms of demographic and health surveillance.",
