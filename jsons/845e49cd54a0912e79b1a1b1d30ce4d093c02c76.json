However, in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, potent immunosuppressive medications lead to severe dysfunction of cell-mediated immunity, which constitutes an important mechanism of defense against viral infections. For some SOT recipients, this is compounded by postoperative changes of the lung that favor the establishment of infection, including a diminished cough refl ex, abnormal lymphatic drainage, and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a consequence, this group of often mild infections causes signifi cant morbidity and mortality in SOT recipients. The causative organisms of pulmonary viral infections in SOT recipients are shown in Table 1 . Most are caused by two major groups-the respiratory viruses and the herpesviruses-which are the focus of this article.",

Furthermore, the risk of infection acquisition through contact with contaminated surfaces must also be stressed. Regular hand hygiene either with hand washing or an alcohol-based hand rub, especially after touching surfaces in communal areas, is an important education message. Patients should avoid contact with persons who are unwell and be aware that young children, especially those in daycare, can have increased carriage of respiratory viruses.

Strategies for prophylaxis include the administration of a defi ned regimen throughout a highrisk period or the administration of a defi ned regimen to an individual shortly after a high-risk exposure to an active source of infection to prevent or attenuate the clinical manifestation of disease. General chemoprophylaxis should be based on proof through virologic surveillance that an epidemic is occurring in the community. The need for daily compliance, possible side effects, and the risk of resistance development should be taken into account [ 11 ] . Two types of anti-infl uenza medications are available for prophylaxis: the M2 matrix inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, which only have activity for infl uenza A, and the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have activity for infl uenza A and B. Since January 2006, the neuraminidase inhibitors were considered fi rst-line therapy because of their enhanced activity against both infl uenza A and B and the widespread resistance to the adamantanes among infl uenza A (H3N2). Increasing resistance to oseltamivir was reported in H1N1 strains in the United States [ 11 , 18 ] . Thus, the CDC recently published revised guidelines for infl uenza chemoprophylaxis [ 18 ] . When an infl uenza A (H1N1) virus infection or exposure is suspected, zanamivir (10 mg once daily) or a combination of oseltamivir (75 mg daily) and rimantadine (100 mg twice daily) is now preferred over oseltamivir alone. When an infl uenza B virus infection or exposure is suspected, oseltamivir or zanamivir can be given [ 18 ] . The dosage of these antiviral medications may differ in children, the elderly, or in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. The recent changes in guidelines highlight the need to review local and state surveillance data to determine the circulating infl uenza virus strains and the most current recommendations for antiviral use. Despite a paucity of data on the optimal timing, dosing, and effi cacy of chemoprophylaxis in the immunocompromised patient, current recommendations are to use the same dose and duration as prescribed for immunocompetent individuals [ 2 ] .",

Preemptive therapy is the administration of antiviral therapy in response to detection of CMV viremia before the patient becomes symptomatic with CMV disease.

Lipid formulations of amphotericin B at a dose of 5 mg/kg were effi cacious in preventing aspergillosis in high-risk liver transplant recipients [ 45 ] . However, low doses (1 mg/kg) and amphotericin B deoxycholate were not adequate for prophylaxis in this patient population [ 46 ] . As discussed for CMV prophylaxis, two strategies for prophylaxis against Aspergillus exist for lung transplant recipients: universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy. Preemptive therapy consists of administration of antifungal therapy whenever Aspergillus is isolated from a respiratory specimen. This is possible in lung transplant recipients because they undergo routine surveillance bronchoscopies with biopsy to monitor for rejection. Overall, however, universal prophylaxis is more common. Aerosolized amphotericin B is the most common form of prophylaxis used in lung transplant recipients. Its use is attractive because it delivers the antifungal agent directly to the infection site, minimizing systemic side effects and drug interactions. A disadvantage of this strategy is that in single-lung transplant recipients, the distribution of the aerosolized amphotericin B occurs preferentially in the transplanted lung, leaving the native lung as a potential source of infection [ 47\u2022 ] . Both amphotericin B deoxycholate and the lipid formulations were studied, with the lipid formulations being better tolerated. Side effects include cough, nausea, and bronchospasm. Voriconazole is also used for Aspergillus prophylaxis in lung transplant recipients. Husain et al. [ 48 ] showed that prophylactic voriconazole for a minimum of 4 months posttransplant decreased the rate of invasive aspergillosis 23% to 1.5%; however, liver enzyme abnormalities occurred in a large proportion of patients. All the strategies described above are also effective for the prevention of Candida infections.",
