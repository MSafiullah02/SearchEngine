In veterinary medicine, most cases are of exogenous origin such as intra\u2010ocular surgery, penetrating injury, corneal ulcer or spread of infectious organisms from ocular adnexa. Endogenous endophthalmitis is rarely described. It results from haematogenous spread of infectious organisms, with an initial site of infection distal to the eye (Khan et al. 2002, Jackson et al. 2003, Ramakrishnan et al. 2009). This report describes a case of acute vision loss secondary to bilateral bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis in a cat.",

Several potential causes were considered: trauma, infectious diseases, neoplasia and idiopathic uveitis. Routine haematology, serum biochemistry (ALT, ALP, urea, creatinine, albumin, total protein and glucose) were all within their respective reference intervals. Tests for common infectious agents (feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus and feline enteric coronavirus) were all negative. The right posterior segment examined by ocular ultrasound was filled with diffuse heterogeneous hyperechoic material (Fig 2). A sample of aqueous and vitreous humour was collected by fine needle paracentesis from the right eye, under general anaesthesia, for cytological examination and bacterial culture. Cytological examination of the vitreous revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous intra\u2010 and extracellular cocci (Fig 3). The results with the aqueous humour were similar, but cocci were less abundant. As there were no signs of trauma and no history of previous ocular surgery, endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis was suspected. Urinalysis, thoracic radiography, abdominal ultrasound examination, echocardiography and blood culture did not detect a primary infection site.",

A dose of 0 \u00b7 2 mg/kg meloxicam (M\u00e9tacam; Boehringer Ingelheim) subcutaneously (sc) every 24 hours was administered in association with iv fluid therapy. Bilateral subconjunctival injection of 1 \u00b7 6 mg/eye triamcinolone acetate (Canitedarol; Merial) was performed, and eyedrops containing 0 \u00b7 1% dexamethasone/polymixin B/neomycin TID (Maxidrol; Alcon) and 1% brinzolamide TID (Azopt; Alcon) were administered. Three days after the initial presentation, the cat had recovered normal appetite and rectal temperature. However there was still no menace response from either eye. In the right eye, an iris bomb\u00e9 was observed with a large fibrin clot. The IOP had increased (59 mmHg). The left eye was unchanged. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture. The strain was multi\u2010drug resistant but susceptible to ampicillin and marginally sensitive to gentamicin (Table 1). The cat was discharged on 20 mg/kg oral ampicillin (Ampicat; Virbac) every 12 hours, oral meloxicam, topical 1% brinzolamide every 8 hours, 0 \u00b7 5% timolol maleate (Timoptol 0 \u00b7 5%; MSD France) every 12 hours in the right eye and 0 \u00b7 3% gentamicin (Gentalline; MSD France) every 8 hours and 0 \u00b7 1% dexamethasone (Maxidex; Alcon) every 8 hours in both eyes. Anterior uveitis and vitreous inflammation decreased gradually in both eyes during the 2\u2010month follow\u2010up but retinal degeneration was observed OS. Oral ampicillin was discontinued after 3 weeks and topical medication was limited to 0 \u00b7 1% dexamethasone solution every 12 hours OU and topical 1% brinzolamide OD. Six months after the initial presentation, the IOP was within reference limits but aqueous flare (+1) was persistent and preiridal fibrovascular membranes and secluded pupil were noted OD. Complete retinal degeneration was confirmed OS (Fig 4). One year after the initial presentation, a mild aqueous flare (+1) and mature cataract were noticed OD.",

            "text": "Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is an uncommon condition seldom reported in veterinary medicine and includes only one case in a cat (Westermeyer et al. 2013), two cases in dogs (Massa et al. 2002, Ledbetter et al. 2009) and five cases in horses (Blogg et al. 1983, Reuss et al. 2009, Priest et al. 2012). In a recent report, an endogenous endophthalmitis secondary to Actinomyces following multiple dental extractions was described in a cat (Westermeyer et al. 2013). Other bacteria, such as Brucella canis, Staphylococcus intermedius, Rhodococcus equi and Borrelia burgdorferi, were isolated from aqueous or vitreous humour in dogs and horses (Blogg et al. 1983, Massa et al. 2002, Ledbetter et al. 2009, Reuss et al. 2009, Priest et al. 2012). In humans, endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare, but well\u2010documented, condition (Binder et al. 2003, Jackson et al. 2003). It accounts for 2 to 8% of all cases of endophthalmitis (Callegan et al. 2002). Causes include abscesses, pneumonia, endocarditis, soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, meningo\u2010encephalitis, septic arthritis, orbital cellulitis and peritonitis (Jackson et al. 2003). In the present case, all these potential causes were investigated and eventually ruled out. However, in humans, the primary infection site is often not identified. In two case series, the infection site could be identified in only 42 and 79% of patients, respectively (Binder et al. 2003, Jackson et al. 2003). It is worth noting that blood culture was considered by some authors as the most reliable way of establishing the diagnosis (Jackson et al. 2003). In a retrospective study, approximately 75% of blood cultures were positive. In the present case, the blood culture was negative. However, a single blood culture was performed and antibiotic therapy was started thereafter. Because bacteraemia is often intermittent, at least three blood cultures are usually recommended and, conceivably, a positive bacterial culture might have been found if several bacterial cultures had been performed (Greiner et al. 2008, Nutsi et al. 2010).",

In the present case, E. faecalis, a Gram\u2010positive streptococcus (Sood et al. 2008), was identified in intra\u2010ocular fluids. E. faecalis belongs to the normal feline gastrointestinal flora (Jackson et al. 2009). In humans, E. faecalis is an uncommon cause of endophthalmitis (Uchio et al. 1992, Scott et al. 2003, Chen et al. 2009, Rishi et al. 2009), mainly observed in old or debilitated patients, when the mucosal or epithelial barrier is disrupted or in cases of alteration of the normal bacterial flora secondary to treatment with antibiotics (Chen et al. 2009). In the present case, the cat was young and had reportedly not received any prior treatment. The only general signs were transient lethargy and anorexia. Risk factors such as FIV or diabetes were excluded. Nevertheless, the hypothesis of mucosal intestinal disruption cannot be ruled out.",

            "text": "In humans, treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis consists of intravitreal injection of antibiotics (Callegan et al. 2002, Binder et al. 2003, Scott et al. 2003, Schiedler et al. 2004, Chen et al. 2009, Rishi et al. 2009). Systemic administration of antibiotics has also been reported (Binder et al. 2003, Schiedler et al. 2004) but was not consistently prescribed. Indeed, the intravitreal concentrations obtained are frequently below the minimal inhibitory concentrations for many ocular pathogens (Callegan et al. 2002, Jackson et al. 2003). In veterinary ophthalmology, intravitreal injections are rarely performed because of the risk of intra\u2010ocular haemorrhage (Boeve & Stades 2007, Regnier 2007). The cat in this report was treated with systemic ampicillin. The penetration of penicillins into normal eyes is generally poor but in case of inflammation, the breakdown of the blood\u2010aqueous barrier facilitates the intra\u2010ocular penetration of ampicillin (Regnier 2007). A posterior vitrectomy is also often performed to remove bacteria, inflammatory cells, membranes and toxic debris in humans (Binder et al. 2003, Scott et al. 2003, Schiedler et al. 2004, Chen et al. 2009, Rishi et al. 2009), and to promote the distribution of antibiotics (Callegan et al. 2002, Jackson et al. 2003). This surgical procedure has not been described for this condition in veterinary medicine and was not available for the present case.",
