Within the category of infectious and parasitic diseases in 2002, there were 31.1 million deaths worldwide from infectious diseases, with 2.7 million of those deaths due to HIV/AIDS, followed by diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. The persistence of infectious diseases, epidemics, and infectious disease outbreaks is attributable to a number of factors including: crowding and migration (e.g., tuberculosis), international travel (e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS), global commerce, resistance promoted by the widespread use of antimicrobials (e.g., increased use and resistance to fluroquinolones and increased rate and severity of Clostridium difficile-related disease, changes in medical practice requiring more invasive procedures and more aggressive procedures (e.g., increased bloodborne catheter infections), changes in the environment (e.g., flooding and increased fecal-oral disease, vector-borne disease, and rodent-borne disease), and changes in social and behavioral factors (e.g., exchange of sex for drugs) (Ahern et al., 2005; Lienhardt, 2001; McDonald et al., 2005; Newman et al., 2004; Olsen et al., 2003).\n",

The recognition of the impact of infectious conditions acquired in the hospital has reached national legislative attention because of its impact on federal health care spending. In the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, Section 5001(c) required the Secretary to identify, by October 1, 2007, at least two conditions that are (a) high cost or high volume or both, (b) result in the assignment of a case to a DRG that has a higher payment when present as a secondary diagnosis, and (c) could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, hospitals will not receive additional payment for cases in which one of the selected Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC) was not present on admission and the case would be paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. Section 5001(c) provides that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can revise the list of conditions from time to time. In the final FY 2008 IPPS rule, CMS identified three infectious HAC subject to this rule: catheter-associated urinary tract infections, vascular catheter-associated blood stream infection, and surgical site infection (mediastinitis after coronary artery by-pass graft [CABG] surgery). Conditions being considered for fiscal year 2009 are ventilator-associated pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus septicemia. This legislation will signal the era of intense focus on infection prevention and control and prevention efforts in health care facilities. The use and application of epidemiologic data and principles are fundamental to the success of these efforts.",

Vector-borne transmission may be mechanical or biological. Mechanical transmission is the physical transmission of an infectious agent, which is not an essential element in its life cycle. Flies can transmit Salmonella on their appendages from contaminated feces to food, representing mechanical transmission. Biological transmission occurs when a vector harbors a pathogen within its body and delivers the pathogen to a host in an interactive manner, such as through propagation, a bite. Malaria is caused by the biological transmission from the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito infected with Plasmodium falciparum, a protozoan parasite into a susceptible host.",

Immunity can be characterized as passive (natural or artificial) or active (natural or artificial). Passive natural immunity is the transplacental transfer of antibodies from mother to fetus. Passive artificial immunity is the inoculation of specific protective antibodies in globulin preparations. Passive artificial immunity has a short-term efficacy (less than 6 months).

            "text": "The occurrence of a disease in excess of what is expected is called an epidemic. The existence of an epidemic is determined in different manners depending upon epidemiologic data on the frequency of its natural occurrence and seasonal variation. Influenza epidemics are defined as rates occurring in excess of one standard deviation above historical trends. Epidemics occurring where the frequency of a disease is expected to be low are determined through a graphical method or the construction of an epidemic curve. A point source epidemic curve follows a bell-shaped distribution of a histogram plotting the number of cases occurring on each date when a case became ill. The peak of the histogram represents the date where the median number of cases became ill. Knowing the suspect infection agent and tracing the incubation time from the date associated with the peak of the histogram an estimate of the time of exposure to the agent can be obtained. A propagated epidemic curve is illustrated by a histogram of the onset of the disease demonstrating repeated peaks of occurrence (Fig. 2a). Epidemics can also be cyclic, recurring according to certain time periods. Influenza and pneumonia-associated deaths typically occur as a cyclic epidemic, with the epidemic threshold exceeded during winter months (Fig. 2b). Epidemics can occur in any setting, in the community or in any setting where populations are in congregate settings (hospitals, prisons, skilled care facilities, schools, etc.). A pandemic is an epidemic that is an epidemic manifest world-wide. The severity of \u00adpandemic disease can vary over the phases of its course. Miller et al. (2009) describe the signature features of past pandemics, including a shift in the virus sub-type, a shift toward increased mortality in younger age groups, multiple successive lethal waves, and high susceptibility of populations resulting in increased transmissibility. Depending upon the features of the pandemic including its potential for animal-human transmission and the extent of countries and regions involved, the World Health Organization (2009) proposed a scheme of phases guiding the deployment of different levels of resources, interventions, and communications for disease control. The determination of an epidemic or pandemic requires the mobilization of many resources within the organization, locally, and even nationally to monitor the progress of an epidemic and to institute appropriate control and prevention measures.\n",

The circumstances of the exposure are its frequency, duration, dose, distance, and degree of intimacy. The degree of susceptibility of the host (e.g., older age plus comorbidities) also determines if the circumstances of the exposure will result in an infectious disease. An epidemic or outbreak may occur if a large number individuals are exposed who do not possess adequate immunity or are not protected in terms of herd immunity.

The ICP is responsible for having the knowledge of which infectious diseases must be reported by state legislation or regulation to the local or state health department. In the absence of an ICP, the designated manager is responsible for the reporting. The general categories of conditions reported are communicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, TB, and vaccine preventable disease. Notifiable diseases vary somewhat by state although all states require reporting of diseases subject to quarantine (cholera, plague, and yellow fever) according to the World Health Organization\u2019s International Health Regulations. The responsibility for reporting diseases to the local health authority depends upon the requirements set forth by that authority. A report to the local health authority in whose jurisdiction the reporter is located is required by any person having knowledge of a known or suspected case or carrier of communicable disease or a death caused by a communicable disease determined notifiable by the local health authority. Among those required to report include: physicians, nurses, nurse aides, dentists, laboratory personnel, school personnel, long-term care personnel, day care personnel, and college/university personnel. Health care providers may disclose individually identifiable health information for use in public health to public health authorities without individual consent without violating HIPAA regulation. The specific data required for reporting includes patient information (name, address, date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity) and testing information (name of test and test result). The Centers for Disease and Control website should be consulted for the latest listing of notifiable diseases in the USA which is revised periodically depending upon the emergence of new pathogens or a decline or elimination of an existing pathogen (Table 4). Even under the best of circumstances, it may take 2\u20133 weeks to confirm a patient\u2019s illness was part of an outbreak because of the time to contact the health system, the timing of the collection of the specimen, clinical laboratory identification of the agent, shipping time of the specimen to the public health lab, and confirmation by the public lab.

Herd immunity is the protection from an infectious agent afforded to a population as a whole because large numbers of its members are immune to an infectious problem and do not harbor it. Following current recommendations for vaccination is a responsibility of all health care providers as it is one aspect of promoting patient safety. The major cost savings to health care organizations are to promote the wide-spread coverage of influenza vaccination among its employees. The prevalence of employees obtaining influenza vaccination will be an important component of hospital infection prevention and control programs to meet new CMS (2007) Guidelines. In 2003, the prevalence of health care workers who received influenza vaccination was only 40%.",

A disease outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a short-time period in a defined population, community, geographical area, or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or extend over several countries within the same few days, weeks, or years. According to the World Health Organization (2007), \u201cA single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g., bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.\u201d The actual number of cases constituting an epidemic depends upon the infectious agent and the circumstances of the case presentation. Two cases of botulism occurring among patrons of a restaurant may be considered an epidemic. An epidemic may arise for several reasons, including: (1) an increase in the number of susceptible persons; (2) the emergence of a new organism; (3) changes in the environment; (4) changes in human behavior; (5) new media for the growth of organisms; (6) the migration of infected persons, animals, birds, or insects into an area; (7) change in the virulence of an organism; (8) inadequate immunization levels in a population; (9) improper sanitation or sanitary practices; or, (10) the intentional introduction of an infectious agent. A clue, if the epidemic is due to the intentional introduction of an infectious agent, is when a case is found to have developed the disease not through usual route of transmission or reservoir. For example, the development of anthrax in the respiratory system is not consistent with the common mode of transmission, namely direct contact with the tissues of animals dying of the disease.",

Second, health care settings often have a high prevalence of patients who are immunocompromised and therefore Standard Precautions should be used in the care of all patients (Table 9).
