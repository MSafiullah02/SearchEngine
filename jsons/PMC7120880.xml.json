However, in a group of immunocompetent patients and in immunocompromised patients, respiratory viral infections present with severe tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. The direct cytopathic effect of the virus causing damage to the respiratory epithelium can be associated to necrotizing bronchitis/bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. The manifestations of viral pneumonia on imaging studies depend on the degree of airway and/or lung parenchymal alteration and on the association of permeability pulmonary edema or alveolar hemorrhage. X-ray findings include normal X-ray, bronchial wall thickening, ill-defined nodules, and \u201cpatches\u201d of peribronchovascular consolidation. HRCT may show ground glass, consolidation, thickening of peribronchovascular interstitium, thickening of interlobular septum, nodules tree-in-bud pattern, and areas of focal air entrapment with mosaic attenuation pattern [8].",
