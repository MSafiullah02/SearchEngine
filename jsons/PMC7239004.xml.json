Obesity and dysmetabolism are highly associated with severe COVID-19 [2] raising the possibility that fatty liver directly mediates inflammation and hypercoagulation leading to respiratory and systemic complications of COVID-19 [3]. Alternatively, fatty liver may indirectly favor replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus [4]. However, several confounders, e.g. an independent role of insulin resistance, and reverse causation, e.g. the impact of SARS-CoV-2, and treatments on fatty liver, may complicate the interpretation these initial retrospective observations.",

UKBB is composed of 502,640 individuals aged between 40 and 69 years [7]. Baseline assessment, medical history and biological samples are available, including also genetic data. We had access to these data with application #37142. UKBB has started to release COVID-19 test results from March 16th 2020 (data-field 40100), and since the tests were mainly restricted to hospitalized patients with symptoms, positive test results can be considered as a proxy of severe disease. As of May 2nd 2020, test results are available for 4,119 individuals (2,770 confirmed inpatients; data were only partially available for the rest). We restricted the analysis to the subset of white British ancestry. After applying quality control (supplementary data), the remaining number of individuals was 1,460, of whom 526 were positive (case) and 934 were negative (control) for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Of these, 835 (57%) were confirmed inpatients. Results are shown in Table 1\n, left panel. The GRS was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, as also observed for carriage of each variant included in the score (all P values>0.1). These results suggest that genetic predisposition to hepatic fat accumulation does not increase per se the predisposition towards severe COVID-19, and that MAFLD does not play a causal role of in this condition.",

However, the current sample size has by far the power to detect a >6-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19 reported by Ji et al. [1]. If ever, we detected a trend of protection against COVID-19 conferred by the rs738409, encoding for the p.I148M PNPLA3 variant, which is a major genetic determinant of hepatic inflammation [5, 8]. Future larger studies are warranted to formally test this hypothesis. A possible reason for differential susceptibility to severe COVID-19 is related to altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptors [9]. We therefore looked at the impact of genetic risk variants on the hepatic mRNA expression of ACE2, CTSL, TMPRSS2 and PYKFYVE [9] in a cohort of 125 obese individuals [8]. We found no significant impact of MAFLD-GRS and single variants with the expression of known viral receptors. However, we observed a trend for higher ACE2 expression associated with carriage of p.I148M PNPLA3 variant that was not statistically significant (p=0.06).",
