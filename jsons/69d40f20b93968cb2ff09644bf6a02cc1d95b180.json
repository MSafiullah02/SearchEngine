            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are two diseases costly to the U.S. swine industry. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of PRRS virus and PED virus, alone or in combination, on growth performance, feed efficiency, and digestibility in grower pigs. Forty-two gilts (16 \u00b1 0.98 kg BW) na\u00efve for PRRS and PED were selected and allocated to 1 of 4 treatments. Treatments included 1) a control, 2) PRRS virus infected, 3) PED virus infected, and 4) PRRS+PED coinfection (PRP). Pigs in treatments 2 and 4 were inoculated with a live field strain of PRRS virus via intramuscular and intranasal routes at 0 d after inoculation (dpi). Treatments 3 and 4 were orally inoculated with a cloned PED virus at 15 dpi. Infection with PRRS virus was confirmed by quantitative PCR and seroconversion. Infection with PED virus was confirmed with PCR. Control pigs remained PRRS and PED virus negative throughout the study. All pigs were offered, ad libitum, a standard diet with free access to water. During the test period, PRRS reduced ADG and ADFI by 30 and 26%, respectively (P < 0.05), compared with control pigs, whereas PRP decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F by 45, 30, and 23%, respectively (P < 0.05). Additional reductions in ADG and G:F were detected in PRP pigs compared with singular PED or PRRS treatments (33 and 16%, respectively). The impact of PED, alone or in combination, on performance (15-21 dpi) reduced ADG (0.66 vs. 0.35 vs. 0.20 kg/d; P < 0.01), ADFI (1.22 vs. 0.88 vs. 0.67 kg/d; P = 0.003), and G:F (0.54 vs. 0.39 vs. 0.31; P = 0.001) compared with control pigs. Compared with control pigs, PRRS infection did not reduce apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and energy. However, PED infection, alone or in combination, decreased ATTD of DM and energy by 8 and 12%, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared with control pigs, PRP reduced N and OM ATTD by 13 and 3%, respectively (P < 0.05). No significant differences in apparent ileal digestibility (AID) were detected between virus challenges. However, Lys AID tended to be reduced in both PED treatments compared with the control (10 and 12%; P = 0.095). Altogether, PRRS reduced growth but did not alter digestibility. Pigs challenged with PED and, to a greater extent, the coinfection of PED and PRRS viruses had reduced ADG, ADFI, G:F, and ATTD of nutrients and energy.",

In young pigs, PRRS has been shown to reduce growth performance and feed efficiency (Greiner et al., 2000; Escobar et al., 2004) and negatively affect intestinal morphology. These pigs also have an increased likelihood of secondary viral and bacterial infections due to the ability of PRRS to suppress the immune response (Van Reeth et al., 1996; Nakamine et al., 1998) . Unlike PRRS virus, the PED virus localizes to the gastrointestinal tract of pigs and induces watery diarrhea along with severe villous atrophy, leading to malabsorption (Madson et al., 2014) . Health challenged pigs often exhibit reduced appetite and feed intake and have altered nutrient utilization in a tissue-specific manner (Johnson, 2002) . Therefore, due to the significant prevalence of PRRS-positive pigs in the Midwest region of the United States, our objectives were 1) to develop a challenge model to study the effects of PED virus alone and coinfected with PRRS virus on pig performance and feed efficiency and 2) to characterize the impact PED and PRRS virus challenges have on nutrient and energy digestibility.",

However, the main effect of PED was significant for ADG and G:F (P = 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively) and showed a tendency for ADFI (P = 0.076). This indicated that PED virus alone and in combination reduced pig performance compared with CON and PRRS pigs. There was no interaction, suggesting no additive effects of coinfection (PRP) on overall growth performance. When comparing the initial impact of PED on performance (15-21 dpi, 7 d of PED infection), CON and PRRS pigs showed no difference (Table 3) . Control versus PED and PRP, however, resulted in sizable reductions in ADG (47 and 70%, respectively; P < 0.001), ADFI (29 and 45%, respectively; P = 0.003), and G:F (28 and 43%, respectively; P = 0.001), respectively. Performance parameters of ADG, ADFI, and G:F during the final week of performance were significantly decreased by PED (P < 0.001, all measures); however, PRRS tended (P = 0.083) to increase ADG and significantly (P = 0.026) influenced ADFI. There were no interactive effects during the final week of growth.",

However, PED, an enteric virus that replicates in villi enterocytes (Neumann et al., 2012) , exhibited reductions in DM and GE ATTD. Unexpectedly, PED did not reduce N or OM ATTD. Similarly, PRP pigs had reduced DM, N, and GE ATTD whereas OM was not different from CON. Also, there were no differences between PED and PRP treatments, which was somewhat unexpected. Differences in ATTD may be explained by rate of passage. When livestock suffer from diarrhea, the rate of passage can be reduced by as much as 50% (Bush et al., 1963) and rate of passage is negatively correlated with total tract digestibility coefficients (Entringer et al., 1975) . A shortened time of passage does not allow as much time for sufficient enzymatic breakdown of feedstuffs, which leads to poor absorption and diarrhea (Blaxter and Wood, 1953 ; Weijers et al., 1959) . It also reduces the amount of time spent in the large intestine for water reabsorption and bacterial fermentation (Levitan, 1969; Clausen et al., 1998; Marchelletta et al., 2013) . Although limited work has been done with industry applicable pathogens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been used to mimic pathogen challenge in pigs. These studies have reported that LPS induced inflammatory challenges attenuate OM, energy, and N ATTD (Rakhshandeh and de Lange 2012; . This agrees with the present study in which PED and PRRS were the immunological agents. Williams et al. (1997a) also reported decreases in N digestibility using a rearing method with piglets exposed to environmental antigens.",

            "text": "There were apparent differences in ATTD between treatments, but interestingly, there were only numerical differences in AID of DM, N, and OM. Apparent ileal digestibility of specific AA was also unaffected by treatment, with only Lys digestibility tending to be reduced in PED challenged pigs. Similarly, in LPS-challenged pigs, AID was not different from nonchallenged pigs (Rakhshandeh et al., 2010) ; however, this differs from a previous study where pigs infected with Salmonella typhimurium had reduced AID of several AA (Lee, 2012) . A limitation of using AID is that endogenous losses cannot be accounted for. Endogenous losses have been previously determined in pigs inoculated with S. typhimurium. This study found that endogenous losses of all AA were increased 4-to 9-fold at 24 h after infection; however, by 72 h after infection, there were no differences in endogenous losses (Lee, 2012) . This may suggest that time of collection (21 dpi for PRRS and 7 dpi for PED) did not capture peak infection differences, which may influence AID. Villus height and crypt depth were severely reduced throughout the small intestine in PED and PRP pigs but minimally affected in PRRS pigs (Schweer et al., 2016) . This leads to reduced surface area of the intestine, which may influence AID. Another diarrheal disease described in pigs, cryptosporidiosis, causes reductions in villi height and crypt hyperplasia and has been reported to decrease villous surface area 3-fold (Argenzio et al., 1990) . Although intestinal morphology was changed, there was no difference in aminopeptidase activity, suggesting that digestive enzymes were still functioning normally (Schweer et al., 2016) . That would leave only feed intake as a major difference between treatments, but feed intake does not greatly affect nutrient digestibility (Haydon et al., 1984; Albin et al., 2001) . Although there are limitations to single point estimates for metabolites and hormones, similarities in blood metabolites between CON and PRRS treatments were expected at 21 dpi (Roberts and Almond, 2003) . Reductions in feed intake, leading to a catabolic state, presumably caused increased blood glucagon and BUN in PED and PRP treatments. This data conflicts with a previous report where pigs infected with rotavirus exhibited no difference in blood glucagon (Zijlstra et al., 1997) . Although differences in BUN were reported here, pigs inoculated with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, the causative agent of swine dysentery, reported no difference in serum total AA concentrations (Jonasson et al., 2007) . Interestingly, blood NEFA in CON, PRRS, and PED treatments was not different, whereas it was increased in PRP pigs. This suggests an additive effect of the PRRS and PED and an increase in immune stimulation-induced changes in metabolism. This potentially results in an increase in lipolysis to provide substrates ATP production and fuel of immune cells (Doughty et al., 2006) as energy intake could be limiting. Fatty acid oxidation also plays an important in memory CD8+ cell generation (Pearce et al., 2009) . Increased NEFA has been previously reported in pigs coinfected with PRRS and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae at 7 dpi compared with control and pair-fed pigs (Oliver, 2004) . This suggests that feed restriction only partially explains the increase in NEFA. Blood glucose and insulin were unaffected by treatment. Similarly, pigs infected with rotavirus had no differences in circulating insulin levels (Zijlstra et al., 1997) . Similar find-ings for blood glucose have been reported in pigs during B. hyodysenteriae infection (Jonasson et al., 2007) whereas others have reported an increase in glucose during infection (Somchit et al., 2003) . Utilization of glucose is increased in tissues and immune cells during immune response, which can cause hypoglycemia (Mizock, 1995) ; however, no differences in blood glucose in the present study suggests these pigs were likely meeting their glucose demands via gluconeogenesis.",

Pig ATTD coefficients were reduced by PED and a coinfection of PRRS and PED, but PRRS alone did not reduce ATTD. Similarly, PRRS, PED, or a combination of both did not significantly decrease AID coefficients of specific AA. Altogether, these results indicate that capability to digest nutrients (as determined by apparent digestibility) seems to be unaffected by systemic or enteric viral challenges. However, the reduction in feed intake resulting from PED and PRRS challenges is probably one of the main limitations for pigs not being able to maintain high growth rates during the 21-d test period.
