Influenza A has the broadest host range of the influenza viruses and significant interspecies transmission occurs [4]. Eighteen haemagglutinin (H) and 11 neuraminidase (N) subtypes have been described in influenza A (of which 16 H and 9 N subtypes have also been detected within avian species) [5]. Influenza B is far less genetically diverse than influenza A and has no distinct antigenic subtypes (mutates 2 to 3 times slower than influenza A and apart from humans, only seals and ferrets have demonstrated susceptibility) [6\u20138].",

They have activity against influenza A but not influenza B (due to their lack of the M2 protein, influenza B has an alternative ion channel called BM2) [12]. Amantadine was approved for clinical use in 1966 and subsequently rimantadine in 1993. Both drugs were initially very effective in treating and preventing influenza A infection with efficacy rates of up to 90%. The resistance of influenza A to amantadine was first recognised during the 1980 influenza A epidemic [12]. However, resistance to both drugs in seasonal influenza A subtypes was rare (1\u20132% frequency) until after 2000 when there was a dramatic rise in rates of resistance. By 2013, approximately 45% of all influenza A subtypes in circulation globally were resistant to the adamantanes (> 69% of H1 subtypes and 43% of H3 subtypes) [11]. Resistance (as a result of the S31N mutation in the M2 protein) to the adamantanes occurs rapidly within 3\u20135 days of use and occurs in 30\u201350% of both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients [13, 14]. Due to such high levels of resistance, the adamantanes are no longer recommended for treatment of influenza A [15].",

They competitively inhibit neuraminidase on the surface of influenza A and B. They act by preventing cleavage of sialic acid residues on budding newly formed virus particles thus preventing release of new virus particles from infected host (ciliated epithelial) cells. Resistance occurs much less readily in comparison with the adamantanes [16]. The neuraminidase inhibitors, if given within 36 h of onset, have been shown to reduce the duration of illness by 30% (with an approximately 40% reduction in illness severity) and, if given within 24 h of symptom onset, even greater reductions in the duration of illness attributable to influenza (approximately 44% reduction) have been observed [17, 18]. A decrease in the incidence of secondary complications, such as otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia, with the use of neuraminidase inhibitors was also demonstrated [17]. Additionally, when used as prophylaxis (before or shortly after exposure), neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the incidence of infection by approximately 70\u201390% [19]. In the UK, oseltamivir (oral agent; typically first line for influenza A and B treatment) and zanamivir (inhaled and also available as an aqueous solution which can be administered intravenously or via nebuliser) are licensed for the treatment of influenza A and B and also for prophylaxis. Oseltamivir is licensed in the UK for use in all ages including neonates, whereas zanamivir is not licensed for children under the age of 5 years. Peramivir (a single-dose intravenous infusion) was licensed in the UK in 2018 but has not been marketed/launched (it is used in the USA, Japan and South Korea). Laninamivir (an inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor) is licensed for use in Japan.",

Prior to 2007, oseltamivir resistance was rarely seen in clinical practice (and low resistance rates of 1\u20135% were reported in clinical trials) [21]. Human cases of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 began emerging during the 2007\u20132008 influenza season. Many of the cases reported were individuals who had not taken oseltamivir demonstrating that resistant virus could be efficiently transmitted between humans [22]. During the 2008\u20132009 influenza season, in some parts of the world, such as the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia, very high rates (> 90%) of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A H1N1 strains were seen [23, 24]. In 2009, the pandemic (pdm09) influenza A H1N1 strain emerged worldwide but in the majority of cases (< 1.5% resistance) remained oseltamivir susceptible initially. Oseltamivir resistant H1N1 pdm09 cases did emerge but this was mostly immunocompromised patients that had received oseltamivir. Subsequently, however, in the 2010\u20132011 influenza season in the UK (and other parts of the world), increasing numbers of oseltamivir resistant cases were identified with no previous oseltamivir exposure [25]. Resistance to oseltamivir was still seen with much greater frequency in immunocompromised individuals receiving oseltamivir (with very little cross-resistance seen with zanamivir).",

Normally when oseltamivir binds to the neuraminidase on the influenza virion, the neuraminidase active site changes shape to accommodate oseltamivir. A neuraminidase mutation, such as H275Y, prevents this conformational change in the active site and therefore, oseltamivir is unable to bind. Zanamivir, however, does not require this structural change in the neuraminidase active site in order to bind [28]. The H275Y mutation reduces the susceptibility (IC50; the half maximal inhibitory concentration) of influenza A H1N1 to oseltamivir by approximately 400-fold but not zanamivir [13, 29]. Peramivir binds to sialic acid residues in a similar manner to oseltamivir and is also affected by the H275Y mutation [30]. This mutation has been shown to persist even after cessation of treatment, and strains harbouring this mutation are capable of causing outbreaks and significant morbidity and mortality in a similar fashion to their wild-type counterparts [14, 27]. Children and severely immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of developing resistance most likely due to higher viral loads and prolonged viral shedding [31].",

In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that influenza A H3N2 and influenza B neuraminidase inhibitor resistant strains have a lower replicative capacity and less ability to transmit. In many of the case reports of influenza A H3N2 and B resistant strains, resistance only occurs after prolonged treatment (> 10 days but over 1 month in many) and these resistant variants often disappear once treatment is ceased [34, 35].

This study included patients over 1 year of age presenting within 24 hours of an influenza-like illness and/or had a positive rapid influenza test. Nose throat swabs were collected on days 1, 3, 6 and 10 for influenza typing/subtyping, sequencing and neuraminidase inhibitor phenotypic susceptibility testing. There were 3230 influenza A and B reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients in the study. Except for 30 patients with pre-treatment (i.e. transmitted) resistant influenza A H1N1 strains, no resistance was detected in day 1 samples. Emergence of oseltamivir resistance after day 1 was detected in 43/1207 (3.56%) of oseltamivir-treated influenza A positive patients; a higher frequency was seen in 1\u20135 year old (11.8%) compared with those over 5 years (1.4%). All resistant H1N1 viruses had the H275Y mutation and all resistant H3N2 viruses had the R292K mutation (conferring reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir). Virus clearance was a median of 8.1 days for treated patients with oseltamivir-resistant virus vs 9.9 days for untreated patients vs 10.9 days for treated patients with oseltamivir-resistant virus. Time to alleviation of symptoms was 1 day shorter in treated patients as compared with untreated patients. Interestingly, the oseltamivir-resistant treated group exhibited the shortest duration of symptoms (symptoms resolved by day 6 or earlier).",

Five out of 6 tolerated and completed the 10-day course of treatment (1 patient had worsening respiratory failure and TCAD was stopped) [58]. A clinical response and a corresponding viral load reduction in the 5 patients that completed treatment. No drug-drug interactions were seen and no haematological toxicity was seen with ribavirin. No new resistance mutations emerged on treatment. A study of TCAD vs oseltamivir in critically ill mechanically-ventilated patients with pandemic H1N1 showed that TCAD was well tolerated but did not improve outcomes compared with oseltamivir alone [59].",
