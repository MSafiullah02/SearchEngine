The many-body ground state of the model Hamiltonian is exactly solvable in a special case, which turns out to serve as a representative of the Haldane phase. In this system, the Haldane phase is protected by Z2 \u00d7 Z2 spin rotation symmetry or time-reversal symmetry. Depending on several parameters, the Hamiltonian can either be in a gapped Haldane or a gapless critical phase. In a certain limit, the phase diagram is determined analytically by perturbation theory, while for general cases, the phase diagram is studied numerically by the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm.",

The SPT phases in 1D interacting bosonic systems are often called the Haldane phases. The exact ground state of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, known as the valance-bond-solid (VBS) state, provides great insight into the Haldane phase in 1D spin chains [3, 4] . The Haldane phase in the AKLT model is protected by the Z 2 \u00d7 Z 2 (dihedral group) spin rotation symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, or inversion symmetry [5] [6] [7] [8] . SPT phases are usually characterized by nonlocal order parameters; in the case of the AKLT model, the spin string order parameter quantifies the hidden antiferromagnetic order in the VBS state [6, [8] [9] [10] .",

Free from the Pauli exclusion principle, one major difficulty of theoretically (including numerically) studying such spinful boson systems lies in their immense Hilbert spaces. Therefore, except for very few rigorous results [35, 36] , various approximations or constraints have been employed to simplify the problem. In particular, to theoretically investigate the Haldane phase in bosonic atoms, there have been two main approaches. One is to study the the effective spin Hamiltonians by focusing on the Mott insulating limit where the charge degree of freedom is frozen [24] . The other approach is to study the itinerant but spinless bosons (by assuming the spin degree of freedom is frozen in some way). In the itinerant case, it is generally believed that a strong enough long-range interaction (LRI) is indispensable for triggering the Haldane phase [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, although a relatively strong dipole-dipole interaction plays the role of LRI in some cases [37, 38] , the dipole-dipole interaction is usually much weaker than the short-range s-wave collision, and thus the LRI is negligible in many experiments [37] .",

In this article, we use spin-1 bosons on a sawtooth chain as an example. Nature of the Haldane phase in this system is manifested by a special case where the ground state is exactly solvable. The Haldane phase is found to exhibit \"hidden VBS order\" which is unique in the system with both spin and charge degrees of freedom.",

Using this paradigmatic ground state, we demonstrate that the Haldane phase in this system, characterized by both nonvanishing spin and charge string order parameters, is protected by Z 2 \u00d7 Z 2 symmetry or time-reversal symmetry. Next, perturbation theory shows that our model in a certain limit reduces to the bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) model in the Haldane or critical phase. Finally, the phase diagram of the model is investigated by the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm [40, 41] , which suggests that the system can either be in a gapped Haldane phase or a gapless critical phase.",

In the phase diagram we have assumed g t 0 , g t 2 , \u03bb 0 and g b 0 = g b 2 = 1/\u03bb 2 . In the g t 0 = 0 plane,\u0124 has an exact and unique ground state (GS) given in Eq. (13) and (14) . In the g t 2 = 0 plane, the GS is massively degenerate, and the ferromagnetic state in Eq. (15) is an exact ground state. Phase diagram in the 1/\u03bb \u2192 0 plane, given by the perturbation theory, coincides with the phase diagram of the BLBQ model. Phase diagram in the 1/\u03bb = 1 plane is determined by the VUMPS algorithm. In particular, numerical results along the curved arrow parameterized by ( \u221a 2 sin \u03d5, \u221a 2 cos \u03d5, 1) are shown in (b)-(d). (b) Scaling of the inverse correlation length 1/\u03be := 2 with respect to 3 \u2212 2. Numbers near the data points denote the corresponding bond dimensions of each block [53] . We can see that a quantum phase transition occurs between \u03d5 = 6\u03c0/36 and 7\u03c0/36. by the S z -basis {|\u03c8 \u03b1 := |\u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , ..., \u03b1 N }, and parameters (J cos \u03b8, J sin \u03b8, c) with J > 0 linearly depend on (g 0 ,g 1 ,g 2 ). The model is in the Haldane phase when \u2212\u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/4, while it is in the critical phase when \u03c0/4 \u03b8 \u03c0/2. At \u03b8 = arctan(1/3) and \u03c0/2, the model is particularly known as the AKLT model and the purebiquadratic model model [50, 51] , respectively.",

When 0 < |\u03bb| < \u221e, the system has inversion symmetry with respective to every lattice site. However, we find that the site-inversion symmetry cannot protect SPT phases. The groups {1,\u00db (I)}, {1,\u00db (zI)}, and {1,\u00db (nI)} can protect SPT phases only when\u00db (I) is a bond inversion [53] , see also [58] .

Table I summarizes the unitary matrices {u q } corresponding to different symmetry operations on |GS . It is then clear that the Haldane phase of |GS is protected by Z 2 \u00d7 Z 2 symmetry or time-reversal symmetry.

Let i := \u2212 ln |\u03bb i |, where \u03bb i is the ith largest absolute eigenvalue of the transfer matrix, and |\u03bb 1 | is normalized to 1. When the bond dimension \u03c7 is extrapolated to infinity, the (spin) correlation length \u03be := 1/ 2 diverges for gapless phases while converges to a finite value for gapped phases. This is known to be well reflected in the scaling relation of 1/\u03be(\u03c7) with respect to 3 (\u03c7) \u2212 2 (\u03c7) [60, 61] , as shown in Fig. 2(b) .

The interaction of spin-s bosons is in general given b\u0177 H int = r S g S,rP (S) r , where S = 0, 2, ..., 2s [37] . Note that VBS states can be constructed on arbitrary lat-tices [4, 65] . Therefore, on a lattice X with a bottom flat band, by properly controlling the particle number and the interaction strength {g S,r }, in the ground state, X can be fully packed with localized wave functions (like the middle of Fig. 1) , and the spin of localized wave functions can entangle nontrivially, followed by the VBS state on the corresponding lattice X [66]. Also, the universality of Eq. (12) suggests that the picture of \"hidden VBS order\" generally applies.

The Haldane phase in this model, protected by Z 2 \u00d7 Z 2 symmetry or time-reversal symmetry, is represented by an exact many-body ground state. Due to both the itinerant and spinful nature of spin-1 bosons, the Haldane phase exhibits the \"hidden VBS order\". The model in a certain limit naturally reduces to the BLBQ model in either critical or Haldane phase. The phase diagram of the model is in general obtained by the VUMPS algorithm. We believe that this work will stimulate future experimental and theoretical studies. There are three different types of an open chain: (i) bottom sites at both ends, (ii) top sites at both ends, and (iii) a bottom site at one end while a top site at the other. Without loss of generality, we consider type (i) as shown in Fig. S1 . Let N be the particle number. Index i in the summation in Eq. (3) now runs from 1 to N \u2212 1.

However, \u03c6 is always quantized to 0 or \u03c0 when u I = v I . This happens when \u0393 m A = \u0393 m B , i.e., the state has bond-inversion symmetry. In this case, Q I := Tr(u I u * I )/\u03c7 equals 1 for trivial phase and \u22121 for the inversionsymmetry-protected Haldane phase [5, 6, 57] . Similar to the analysis in Eq.
