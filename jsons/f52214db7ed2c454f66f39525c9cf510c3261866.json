Bats appear to have some unique features in their innate immune system that inhibit viral replication causing limited clinical symptoms, and thus, contributing to the virus spill over to humans. Here, kidney epithelial cell lines derived from four bat species (Pteropus dasymallus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Miniopterus fuliginosus) and two non-bat species (Homo sapiens and Mesocricetus auratus) were infected with EMCV and JEV. The replication of EMCV and JEV was lower in the bat cell lines derived from R. leschenaultii, R. ferrumequinum, and M. fuliginosus with a higher expression level of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) and interferon-beta (IFN-b) than that in the non-bat cell lines and a bat cell line derived from P. dasymallus. The knockdown of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in Rhinolophus bat cell line using antisense RNA oligonucleotide led to decrease IFN-b expression and increased viral replication. These results suggest that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 are important for antiviral response against EMCV and JEV in Rhinolophus bats.",

EMCV, a potential omnipresent zoonotic agent, has a broad host range with rodents as its natural reservoir [2] . As yet, there has been no report of EMCV isolation from bats; however, Miniopterus fuliginosus is supposed to be one of the natural hosts of EMCV due to the detection of a genome fragment of the virus in the bat's fecal guano [3] . JEV is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus with humans as the definitive hosts and pigs as the amplification hosts [4] . JEV have been isolated from multiple species of fruits and insectivorous bats in several Asian countries [5] . Experimental infection of JEV in some insectivorous and fruit bats showed persistent viremia and viral replication in multiple organs without pathological symptoms or signs of encephalitis [6] .",

Previous studies have showed that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 signaling is critical for IFN-b production and susceptibility of cells against EMCV and JEV infection in humans and mice [12e16] . Only a few studies are available on PRRs and type I IFN signaling in bats during viral infection. Activation of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 after poly(I:C) stimulation have been described in P. alecto kidney cell line, Desmodus rotundus fetal lung cell line, and E. fuscus kidney cell line; however, their role in stimulating type I IFN production has been clarified only in the E. fuscus kidney cell line [17e19]. Here, the influence of EMCV and JEV on PRRseIFNeb signaling in bat cell lines derived from four bat species (Pteropus dasymallus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Miniopterus fuliginosus) was examined.",

The bat kidney cell lines were established as previously described [20, 21] and were derived from proximal epithelial tubules cells based on the presence of AQP1 and MUC-1, specific markers for proximal and distal epithelial cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Partial DNA sequence of AQP1 and MUC-1 from all cell lines can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2 The EMCV strain used in this study, NIID-NU1, was provided by Dr. Kazuya Shirato (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan). The genome sequence of NIID-NU1 strain of EMCV was determined (GenBank accession number LC508268). The EMCV strain NIID-NU1 was clustered into group 1A and most closely related to EMCV GS01 and PV21 strains, which were isolated from pigs (Supplementary Fig. 4 ; and Supplementary Table 2 ). The JEV strain, JEV/sw/Chiba/88/2002, was isolated from swine serum [22] . Both EMCV and JEV were propagated in BHK-21 cells and the virus titer was determined by plaque assay. All kidney cell lines were infected with EMCV and JEV at MOI of 1.0 and 0.01 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS medium inside biosafety level 2 laboratory.",

The high basal expression level of PRRs (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) has been observed in several bat species, including R. leschenaultii, Rhinolophus affinis, and Desmodus rotundus [19, 27, 28 ]. This high basal expression level of PRRs in the above three species of bats enables quick elimination of EMCV and JEV through stimulation of type I IFN production. Conversely, the FBKT1 cells derived from P. dasymallus showed a low basal expression of PRRs. This is consistent with previous study wherein the expression level of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in P. alecto kidney was very low compared to that in other tissues; however, the kidneys of R. leschenaultii and R. affinis had an expression level of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 comparable to other tissues [18,28e30] .

Inability of FBKT1 and HEK293T cells to limit EMCV replication might be due to their inability to increase the expression of PRRs and IFN-b as high as that in DEMKT1 and BKT1 cells (Fig. 2B , C, 2D, and 2E). Similar to other flaviviruses, JEV also can antagonizes type I IFN production to evade antiviral immunity and benefit viral replication through suppression of RIG-I and MDA5 to inhibit type I IFN production [31, 32] . The suppression of RIG-I and TLR3 observed in FBKT1 after JEV infection should have caused limited increase in IFN-b production (Fig. 2B, C, and 2E ). In contrast, JEV failed to suppress the PRRs in BKT1, DEMKT1, and YUBFKT1 cells.",

Increased replication level of EMCV and JEV after knockdown of PRRs indicates that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 are responsible for suppressing EMCV and JEV replication in BKT1 cells through IFN-b production. IFN-b is predominantly induced by TLR3 after EMCV infection but comparable IFN-b expression level was shown in all cells knocked down for PRRs after JEV infection. In a previous study, knockdown of PRRs in E. fuscus kidney cells also showed that IFN-b is predominantly induced by TLR3 than RIG-I and MDA5 after poly(I:C) transfection [17] . Even though the TLR3 knockdown cells had the lowest IFN-b expression level, knockdown of TLR3 did not result in the highest EMCV replication level. Knockdown of MDA5 resulted in the highest EMCV and JEV replication level among all cells knocked down for PRRs ( Fig. 4A and 4B ). Previous studies have showed that MDA5 is the dominant mediator of type I IFN and cytokine response during EMCV infection in mice because of RIG I degradation by EMCV 3C protease [12, 16] . MDA5 seemed to have a greater role in stimulating antiviral pathway in Rhinolophus bat cells because it was highly up-regulated as compared to other PRRs after EMCV infection of BKT1 cells and was the only up-regulated PRRs after JEV infection (Fig. 3B, C, and 3D) . It is possible that MDA5 stimulates antiviral pathways other than IFN-b during EMCV and JEV infection of BKT1 cells.",
