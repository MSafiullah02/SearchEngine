However, clinical characteristics of HPIV coinfection with other pathogens were unclear. This study aimed to investigate the viral and atypical bacterial etiology of LRTI in children and compare the clinical characteristics of HPIV single infection with those of coinfection. Methods: This study included 1335 patients, aged between 1 to 71 months, diagnosed with LRTI in Yuying Children\u02bcs Hospital, Zhejiang, China, from December 2013 to June 2015.

In addition, mixed infections were identified frequently. [4] [5] [6] Several studies discussed the clinical characteristics of coinfection compared with single virus infection, but most of them analyzed on a general basis or focused solely on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). [5] [6] [7] As one of the most common pathogens of LRTI, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) is found worldwide, especially in children aged less than 5 years. 8 HPIV can cause severe respiratory infection and accounts for 9 to 30% inpatient children admitted due to acute respiratory infection. 9 An increasing number of recent studies focused on HPIV, especially the epidemiology and presentation of four types of HPIV. 10 However, a few studies discussed coinfections with HPIV. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the viral and HPIV-positive patients were divided into three groups based on the test results: HPIV single infection, coinfection with other viruses, and coinfection with atypical bacteria. The diagnosis of LRTI for each patient was performed by at least two attending physicians based on Zhu Futang Practice of Pediatrics, 8th edition. 11 It was defined according to the clinical symptoms, including severe cough, fever, tachypnea, wheezing, and respiratory distress signs such as nasal flaring, retraction, cyanosis, and abnormal auscultatory findings (wheezing and crackles), or radiologic evidence indicative of an LRTI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 348, "end": 351, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Clinical syndromes of bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia were included in the LRTI category.

It has long been known that simultaneous viral infections exhibit a phenomenon called viral interference, in which one virus blocks the growth of another virus.28 The effect depends on the virus causing the primary infection,29 number of viruses used to initiate an infection,30 speed of virus replication, and delay between initial and secondary infections.22 A study found that rhinovirus, the fastest-growing virus, reduced the replication of the remaining viruses during a coinfection, while the replication of parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus, was suppressed in the presence of other viruses.22 An early infection and a high number of viruses promote coinfection.22 Therefore, further studies should focus on the coinfection of specific viruses and confirm the course of virus infection.HPIV has four subtypes. HPIV3 manifests the major part of HPIV.17 The tropism of HPIV1-4 are different with each other. HPIV1 and HPIV2 are more likely to induce stridor and croup, while HPIV3 and HPIV4 have similar clinical presentations, and are more associated with hypoxia.31,32 A study compared the clinical manifestations between HPIV3 and HPIV4 single infection and coinfection groups respectively, found no difference between the two groups.They did not compare the clinical manifestations of HPIV1 and HPIV2 due to the low number cases.33 However, further classification of HPIV subtypes was not done in the present study. The severity of HPIV1-4 coinfection remains unclear.Neutrophilia were most commonly detected in patients with ADV and HRV.17 Meanwhile, HRV, RSV, and ADV were the most frequent agents detected in coinfection. It might explain the result that neutrophil percentage in coinfection with viruses was higher than that in HPIV single infection. Another study found that the percentage of neutrophils was lower among children with single virus infection compared with mixed viruses and mixed virus/bacteria infection. 34 This might suggest it was a common phenomenon that coinfection increased the percentage of neutrophils. The mechanism needs further study.Compared with HPIV single infection, coinfection with atypical bacteria was more related to running nose, moist rales, and longer hospital duration. Coinfection with atypical bacteria was also associated with longer hospital duration compared with coinfection with other viruses. It might indicate that HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria led to more serious situations. Children with a viral coinfection with mycoplasma had significantly higher rates of running nose, 35 which might manifest the synergistic effect on running nose of the two kinds of pathogens. Coinfection with atypical bacteria was more related to moist rales, contrary to the typical clinical features of atypical bacteria single infection. Few studies have explored the coinfection with atypical bacteria. Hence, further studies are needed to confirm the findings. The present study had several limitations. Children were evaluated at a single center and the number of patients enrolled was small, limiting the validity of virus-specific clinical correlations in other settings. Also, the study was not double blind. In addition, the study lacked further division of HPIV 1 to 4 and analyses of the clinical characteristics of coinfection with bacteria. Last but not least, the study lacked long-term followup information. In conclusion, this study demonstrated viral infections as the leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness, especially in children aged less than 3 years. The pathogens identified most frequently were RSV, HRV, HPIV, ADV, and HMPV. The coinfection rate was high. HPIV single infection was milder compared with coinfection with other viruses. Coinfection with atypical bacteria led to more serious situations compared with HPIV single infection and coinfection with other viruses.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors thank the colleagues at the Department of Children\u02bcs", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"}, {"text": "Hospital, for their support during the study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Respiratory Disease, Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children\u02bcs"}, {"text": "Zhejiang Province (2015C37026).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "This study was supported by the Science and Technology projects in"}, {"text": "The authors declare that there are no conflict of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST"}, {"text": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0531-4917", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Peipei Zhong"}]}
