Their higher incidence and severity during winter months increases the burden of RTIs. Associated pathogens confined to winter months, with often overlapping epidemics, are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (influenza)(Eccles, 2002, Griffin et al., 2002, Mourtzoukou and Falagas, 2007). Although RTIs in patients presenting to primary care are usually self-limiting, infections in individuals at the extremes of the age spectrum are typically more severe, with prolonged symptoms and an increased risk of complications (Thompson et al., 2003, Falsey et al., 2005, Amand et al., 2018, Belongia et al., 2018a). Also in individuals between the ends of the age spectrum (mostly working adults), RSV and influenza are considered important pathogens (Hashem and Hall, 2003, Hall et al., 2009).",

A promising example of targeted treatment is the use of different treatment strategies across age groups. However, the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and illness course of RSV and influenza infection in adults is not well described. Several international studies reported on the prevalence of RSV among adults with cough in primary care. However, these studies recruited from a single country, mostly the US (Dowell et al., 1996, Hall et al., 2001, O'Shea et al., 2005, Volling et al., 2014). Epidemiological studies suggested that the illness course of RSV approaches that of influenza, with the elderly at higher risk of serious illness (Haber, 2018). Despite the increase in awareness of a possible association with age, our understanding of the illness course of RSV and influenza across different age groups is poor. Therefore, we set out to assess the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and illness course of RSV and influenza infection in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough.",
