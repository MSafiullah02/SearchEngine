Method: Utilization of the available sequence information, homology modeling, and in slico docking a number of available medications might prove to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 two main drug targets, the spike glycoprotein, and the 3CL protease. Results: Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove to be effective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. Several antiviral medications: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir show potential as and 3CL PRO main proteinase inhibitors and as a treatment for COVID-19. Conclusion: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 3CL PRO main proteinase. It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin, B2 deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The use of these off-label medications may be beneficial in the treatment of the COVID-19.",

While there are structural similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SARS spike protein, the conservation is only 73% with most of the variability being in the host cell interaction region of the protein. Currently, there is no crystal structure available for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, so we employed homology modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 utilizing the SARS spike protein (PDB: 2GHV) as a template. The second in silico docking model is the 3CL PRO main protease, which is responsible for controlling several major functions of the virus and has a highly conserved catalytic domain from the SARS virus [5] .
