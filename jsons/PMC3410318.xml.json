Thus asthmatic patients still might be at an increased risk for influenza-related complications, but because of their medical history, they might be more likely to seek care earlier, resulting in improved outcomes. The risk for community-acquired bacterial and viral pneumonia has been estimated to be at least 2-fold in asthmatic patients compared with that seen in healthy control subjects.11, 12, 13\n",

Children with asthma have increased rates of both otitis media and gastroenteritis during infancy. Increased prevalence of ear infections during infancy was reported by Eldeirawi et al16 among Mexican American asthmatic children (39%) compared with nonasthmatic children (20%); this association was independent of antibiotic use and other infectious history. A similar relationship was noted between otitis media and both asthma and atopic dermatitis in a German birth cohort.17 A cross-sectional study of 26,400 Korean children by Ahn et al18 identified a higher prevalence of acute gastroenteritis during infancy in children later given a diagnosis of asthma. Recall bias is a concern for the studies conducted by Eldeirawi et al16 and Ahn et al18 because they relied on retrospective reporting. In addition, patients with atopic dermatitis are highly susceptible to cutaneous bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, most notably Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus.19, 20 Delayed therapeutic response times and an increased likelihood of recurrence were identified for genital warts in patients with a history of hay fever, eczema, or asthma.21\n",

Bisgaard et al22 collected hypopharyngeal samples from 321 asymptomatic neonates at 1 month of age and found colonization of the airways with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis to be associated with the development of asthma by age 5 years. We postulate this colonization is due to an altered immune response that predisposes these infants to early acquisition of these pathogens, although this colonization could also indicate a causal relationship between the pathogen and asthma inception. Increased frequency of colonization with S pneumoniae has also been demonstrated in asthmatic patients. In a cross-sectional, population-based prospective study of 1013 adolescents, asthma was an independent risk factor for nasopharyngeal colonization of S pneumoniae, which was identified in 8.2% of subjects.23 An increased prevalence of bacterial colonization of the skin, primarily with S aureus, is seen in patients with atopic dermatitis24 and occurs in both lesional and clinically normal skin.25\n",

As with colonization, we propose that latent infections reflect an altered immune response, although an alternative explanation is that these pathogens might play a role in asthma pathogenesis. Mycoplasma or Chlamydia species have been identified in the airways of 45% and 11% of asthmatic patients, respectively, although Mycoplasma species is found in only 9% of healthy control subjects.27 A positive relationship between Chlamydia pneumoniae\u2013specific secretory IgA antibody levels and asthma exacerbations28 provides further evidence for latent bacterial infection affecting asthma severity. In contrast, Sutherland et al34 identified only 13% of patients with suboptimally controlled asthma to have PCR evidence for M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae on lower airway endobronchial biopsy. Furthermore, the addition of clarithromycin did not improve asthma control, making the clinical relevance of latent atypical bacterial infection unclear. Improved detection methods for atypical respiratory pathogens are needed to more fully characterize the relationship between these pathogens and asthma.",

Results from other29 but not all27, 35 studies have supported an increased prevalence of latent adenovirus infection in asthmatic patients, likely because of varying viral detection techniques and small sample sizes. A high incidence of persistent rhinovirus infection has also been identified in asthmatic patients, with detectable rhinovirus RNA in greater than 40% of asthmatic children 6 weeks after an acute exacerbation.31 Rhinovirus RNA has also been identified in 73% of mucosal biopsy specimens of asymptomatic asthmatic patients compared with only 22% without asthma, with the presence of human rhinovirus significantly associated with lower pulmonary lung function.33 Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between rhinovirus persistence and asthma disease severity. Because of the finding of successive infections in children with different serotypes of human rhinovirus,36 studies that incorporate genotyping will also be helpful in determining whether what appears to be a latent rhinovirus infection in asthmatic patients is indeed viral persistence or conversely subsequent infections with different serotypes. This differentiation will be critical to furthering our understanding of rhinovirus infection in asthmatic patients and to guide future therapeutic measures, including human rhinovirus-specific vaccines.",

An increased risk for serious pneumococcal disease in patients with atopic disease has also been demonstrated.48 Patients with atopic dermatitis are also highly susceptible to widespread disseminated viral infections, including eczema molluscatum, eczema herpeticum, and eczema vaccinatum.49 Interestingly, these conditions are not typically seen in patients with other inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis.50\n",

An inverse relationship between cord blood IFN-\u03b3 responses and the frequency of symptomatic viral respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated within the first year of life.61 Allergen exposure and RSV both reduce INF-\u03b3 production compared with RSV infection alone in both murine62 and rat63 models and might thus be synergistic in increasing host susceptibility to infection. The importance of the deficient IFN-\u03b3 production is further supported by the modulation of postviral sequelae, including significantly less bronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis, when rats with deficient IFN-\u03b3 responses receive exogenous IFN-\u03b3 supplementation during acute viral illnesses.64 Deficient IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb responses to infection with rhinovirus have been demonstrated in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro.65, 66 Furthermore, the amount of IFN-\u03bb production in bronchoalveolar lavage cells infected in vitro with rhinovirus significantly inversely correlated with clinical illness severity of the same subjects infected with rhinovirus in vivo,65 although these findings have not been replicated by others. Bochkov et al67 and Lopez-Souza et al68 demonstrated no difference in interferon responses in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients in vitro in response to rhinovirus infection compared with those seen in healthy control subjects. More recently, in vitro studies in nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic patients have demonstrated lower production of IFN-\u03bb1 after rhinovirus infection compared with that seen in healthy control epithelium but a higher severity of illness was associated with higher levels of IFN-\u03bb1 production by asthmatic patients in vivo.69 How this relates to human clinical infection risk and illness severity and whether increasing interferon responses would modify morbidity still needs to be elucidated.",

High IL-5 production by TH2 cells at birth predicts future risk of severe respiratory tract infections in childhood, whereas concomitant IL-10 production by T cells at birth attenuated this risk.74 In a murine model, after infection of the lungs with Chlamydia muridarum, IL-13, a TH2 cytokine, is rapidly produced and promotes susceptibility to infection, possibly related to impairment of macrophage phagocytic function.75 This might explain why allergic asthmatic patients, with a dominant TH2 response and enhanced IL-13 production, would be more susceptible to chlamydial lung infection. Downregulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) might be responsible for increased susceptibility of asthmatic patients to Mycoplasma species infection because Mycoplasma species clearance in an allergic murine model has been demonstrated to be due to TLR2 downregulation.76\n",

Many of these genes have a multitude of functions, but all have been found to be involved in the TH2 inflammatory response to epithelial damage sustained during trauma or infection. A variety of genetic mutations have been identified in patients with atopic dermatitis that are associated with skin barrier dysfunction. The most commonly identified is a filaggrin mutation present in up to 50% of patients with atopic dermatitis81 and associated with the persistence of atopic dermatitis into adulthood,82 as well as increased asthma severity.83 The downregulation of multiple immune response genes have also been identified in patients with atopic dermatitis.50 It has also been postulated that parental asthma or allergy might influence immune function, with maternal history of atopy or asthma identified as a risk factor for more severe infant human rhinovirus\u2013associated illness.84 Furthermore, lower cytokine responses to innate stimulation by TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9 agonists and in vitro stimulation by RSV have been seen in children with a parental history of allergy or asthma.85\n",

The enhanced TH2 activity seen in patients with asthma and atopic disease might have a teleological basis because it confers a protective advantage against infection with helminthic parasites,86, 87, 88 which were far more common pathogens in past centuries.89 TH2 immune signaling in the lungs of asthmatic patients can have deleterious effects, such as increased eosinophil activity, mucus hypersecretion, and muscle hyperactivity; however, these same immune mechanisms promote helminth expulsion when expressed in the gut in response to parasitic infection.90 Peisong et al88 discovered that children with upregulated TH2 immune signaling caused by an asthma-associated genetic variant of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 had increased resistance to infection with the helminth Ascaris lumbricoides. A similar relationship between atopy and helminth infection has been described in Venezuelan children86 and in an African adult population.87 Together, these studies support a protective advantage against parasitic infections among those with asthma and atopy. It has also been proposed that the reverse is true; that is, that parasitic exposure reduces the likelihood of the development of asthma and atopic disease.91\n",

Treatment of cells with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 followed by infection with rhinovirus resulted in a normal antiviral response to rhinovirus, including induction of apoptosis and reduced rhinovirus replication. Intrabronchial delivery of IFN-\u03b1 in an asthmatic cohort has not been effective because it induced bronchospasm with a significant decrease in FEV1.117 Another treatment option under investigation includes the use of glutathione supplementation in patients with severe asthma because these patients have reduced levels of glutathione and subsequent impairment of airway macrophage function.

The shared pathways demonstrated by recent studies support the possibility of altered susceptibility to specific viral and bacterial pathogens within patients with asthma and atopic disease.
