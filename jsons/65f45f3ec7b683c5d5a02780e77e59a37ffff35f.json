            "text": "Introduction -Pathways for COVID-19 Spread in Long-Term Care 18With the Pandemic spread of COVID-19 infections, and understanding that the virus is spread via19    droplet nuclei, as well as fomite transmission from surfaces,1 patients and staff in Skilled Nursing20 Facilities, Assisted Living, or other Long Term Care facilities face special challenges, as elderly 21 populations with pre-existing conditions are at higher infection risk. 2 22 According to the California Department of Public Health, 3 \"Most SNFs do not have airborne infection 23 isolation rooms (AIIR) for placement of residents with COVID-19 infection\u2026 Place residents with 24 suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection in single occupancy rooms (or cohorted in multi-occupancy 25 rooms with other residents with confirmed COVID-19 infection) with the door closed. Symptomatic 26 residents and exposed roommates must limit movement outside their room; if they need to leave the 27 room, they should wear a facemask.\" Atkinson et al, 2009 reported that respiratory droplets from humans (which may include bacteria, fungi 30 and viruses) typically range from 0.5 to 12 microns in diameter, and droplet nuclei < 5 \u00b5m can remain 31 airborne for significant periods of time. 4 Doremalen, Bushmaker et al recently reported that COVID-19 32 remains stable in airborne aerosols for at least 3-hours, and can persist on inanimate surfaces for 48-72 33 hours 5 . Kampf, et al reported Corona viruses can live on surfaces up to 9 days. 6 34 35 Based upon the above, it can be seen that techniques for prevention of infection including social 36 distancing, interception of droplet discharge during coughs and sneezes, regular cleaning and disinfection 37 of surfaces, hand-hygiene and the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are all essential to 38 controlling spread. However, those steps alone are unlikely to provide adequate protection for residents 39 and care providers in Long-Term Care facilities as several Long-Term care facilities have reported 40 COVID-19 outbreaks. 41 42Control of Airflow Essential to Reducing Infection Spread 43In Acute Care Facilities Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) rooms are designed to be under a slight 44 negative pressure with respect to adjacent rooms and hallways. This reduces the potential for airborne 45 respiratory droplets from being carried on air currents from the patient into the hallways where it can then 46 be further transported into surrounding areas. General design parameters typically include an exhaust fan 47 discharging above the rooftop drawing air from the AII room at a rate sufficient to place the room under 48 approximately -0.03\" water column vacuum relative to the hallway. According to the American Society 49 of Heating Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE-170), AII rooms provide 12 air 50 changes per hour with 2 air changes per hour (ACH) from outdoor air.7  ASHRAE 170 recommends that 51 Resident Rooms within Skilled Nursing Facilities provide only 2 ACH outdoor with no pressure 52 differential. 53 5 Steps to Modify Patient Rooms to Negative Pressure 55 Administrators or Facility Managers for Long-Term Care Facilities should consider the following to 56 reduce risk of community infection within the facility. Inform your State Department of Health 57 representative to ensure that these do not result in non-compliance with Life Safety Code or State 58 regulations. 59 60",

Contact an Industrial Hygienist and HVAC 70 contractor to discuss options for supplemental exhaust ventilation through these portals. This may 71 include an in-line fan to increase exhaust discharge from bathroom vents, or increasing the size of exhaust 72 fans. In a 2400 ft 3 resident room, the addition of additional 100 cfm of exhaust discharging from the 73 room to the outdoors would increase air changes per hour (ACH) from 2 to approximately 4.5. A 250 74 cfm booster fan would increase the air exchange rate by approximately 6.5 ACH beyond the 2 ACH 75 already provided by the rooftop air handler.
