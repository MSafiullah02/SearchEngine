Although supportive measures and stringent infection control measures remain as the cornerstone of management, there is no known effective antiviral for this disease. After the spike (S) protein of the virus interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptor of the host cell, the virus enters by membrane fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is followed by replication using RNA dependent RNA polymerase, translation, virus assembly and release ( Fig. 1) . Several existing drugs have been identified that are postulated to act on one of these critical steps ( Fig.  1 ). While the efforts to develop new and effective drugs are ongoing; until there are more definitive answers, effective repurposing from the existing arsenal of antivirals are being used every day. There is a call to deal with this pandemic at a war footing. Every intervention, howsoever small, with a potential benefit are being explored every day. Although, Infectious disease society of America recommends the use of the repurposed drugs in the setting of clinical trials alone due to lack of evidence; data from related viruses (like SARS-CoV-1 and MERS), in-vitro studies and growing shreds of clinical evidence from this pandemic are being used to choose the drugs which can be repurposed [2] . The drugs have been discussed under the following headings: anti-parasitic drugs, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies and miscellaneous (Table 1 and Table 2 ).",

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has an extra hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain and is commonly used in the management of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Both these drugs have shown to have some anti-viral properties and may be useful in treating patients with COVID-19. Both CQ and HCQ interfere with the glycosylation of ACE-2 receptor, which is essential for the viral entry [49, 50] . Both the drugs are a weak base, and they interfere with the acidification of lysosome. This interferes with the pH-dependent endosome mediated viral entry [49, 50] . Both the drugs inhibit activation of cells by MAP kinase (P38 MAP kinase [49, 50] and inhibit post-translational modification of M proteins, thereby altering viral assembly and budding [49, 50] . Also, both the drugs are immunomodulatory agents and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines [49, 50] . Compared to CQ, HCQ has a better in-vitro potency (7.6 times more potent), safety profile and lesser drug-drug interactions. HCQs have high accumulation in cells and long elimination half-life.",

Drug-drug interactions and comorbidities (pregnancy, chronic renal impairment) should be considered while defining the doses. Administration with food may be helpful as the bioavailability is increased with food. Although some experts are recommending routine use of CQ and HCQ as prophylaxis, there is no evidencing supporting this recommendation. CQ and HCQs have been successfully used for malarial prophylaxis, but similar results have not been observed for viral infections [61] . CQ has a narrow therapeutic window, but when appropriate dosing is used, it is relatively well tolerated. Compared to CQ, HCQs are better tolerated. Minor side effects include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Toxic doses may lead to lifethreatening cardiomyopathy, macular retinopathy and neurotoxicity.",

Recently, laboratory studies have suggested its role as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent [68] . In influenza, it inhibits the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin, whereas it interferes with viral morphogenesis in rotavirus [68] . It can also limit virus entry, viral release and cell-to-cell transmission.

In another study, the addition of LPV/r to IFN B in MERS CoV infected cell lines did not enhance the activity of IFN B alone [85] . LPV/r was also found to have activity against Human coronavirus 229 E [32] . No in-vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as of now. In humanized transgenic mice, LPV/r plus IFN B was not able to reduce the viral load of MERS CoV [85] . However, in non-human primate models (marmosets) infected with MERS CoV, LPV/r was able to reduce viral load and improve clinical progress [86] . In a study on health care workers exposed to MERS, lower rates of infection were noticed when they were given post-exposure prophylaxis of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days [87] . In patients of SARS-CoV-1 without ARDS, the addition of LPV/r to ribavirin and corticosteroids resulted in better clinical outcomes when compared to historical controls who received ribavirin and corticosteroids [84] . In a retrospective matched cohort study, LPV/r resulted in better clinical outcomes in patient with SARS [88] . Small case series have reported apparent benefit with LPV/r. Ten patients with COVID-19 were given sustained LPV/r with good outcomes [16] . In another study, 17 patients who received oral LPV/r alone, 52.9% of the patients showed clearance of viraemia on day 14 [16] . However, an open labelled trial of 199 COVID-19 patients did not show any decrease in time to clinical improvement, mortality or viral load after addition of LPV/r (Table 1) [7] . Although this trial failed to show any benefit of LPV/r, it can be argued that patients had already developed lung injury at the time of enrolment. The median time of enrolment in this study was 13 days [7] . It is postulated that since the viraemia is present in the early part of the illness and the lung involvement is a result of cytokine release and immune response, the drug may be effective when given in the early part of the illness. In the study by Chan et al. on patients with SARS-CoV-1, LPV/r was beneficial when given in the early part of illness but did not have any significant impact when it was given as a salvage or rescue [88] .",

The therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir was first described in an animal model against Ebola. Subsequently, Dyer et al. described preliminary findings suggesting mortality benefit when remdesivir was given in the early stages of Ebola [94] . The drug has exhibited in vitro and in-vivo activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [85, 92, 96] . Wang et al. showed that the use of remdesivir is effective against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cell lines [57] . Case reports of success with remdesivir in patients with COVID-19 have been documented [98, 99] . In a recent multi-centric single-arm study by Grein et al., remdesivir was used in 53 patients of COVID-19, improvement in oxygen support class was demonstrated in 68% of the patients (Table 1 ) [8] . This drug has a long half-life and needs once-daily dosage. The trial by Grein et al. used dosing of 200 mg on day one, followed by 100 mg from day 2 to day 10 [8] . The most common side effects are transient gastrointestinal symptoms and transaminitis.",

Tocilizumab acts against the soluble and membranebound IL-6 receptors and inhibits the inflammatory action of IL-6 [108] . Pulmonary injury and ARDS has been postulated to be a result of hyper-inflammatory state in the latter half of the illness in COVID-19 due to increase in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 [109, 110] . Similar studies from patients with influenza have shown that high IL-6 levels are associated with severity [111] . However, mice models show that IL-6 is also useful to prevent virus-induced neutrophil death and is a useful host response in early infection. Therefore, it is imperative to understand that molecules such as tocilizumab can only be used only in patients with severe disease when cytokine release syndrome is suspected as evidenced by an increased IL-6. There are no published reports of the use of tocilizumab in SARS and MERS. Preliminary case series have shown good outcomes with tocilizumab (400 mg) in 21 patients with severe or critical COVID-19. All the patients either improved (19/21) or were improving (2/21) at the time of reporting [112] . In another study of 30 patients, it was found that the use of tocilizumab was associated with lesser ICU admission and requirement of mechanical ventilation when compared to controls (Table 1 ) [9] .",

Initial results of compassionate use of remdesivir are encouraging but the drug needs to be evaluated in well-designed randomized trials before it can be used routinely. Tocilizumab has been proposed for use in severe or life-threatening cases of cytokine release syndrome based on studies with very small sample size which have shown good results.

A small French study of 11 patients by Molina et al. failed to show beneficial effects (early clearance of virus) of combining HCQ and azithromycin in patients with COVID-19[65]. In another multi-centric retrospective study of 181 patients with COVID pneumonia from France, there was no difference in worse clinical outcomes between the two arms(Table 1)[5]. In a quasi-randomized controlled trial by Barbosa et al., of the 63 recruited patients, 32 received HCQ while 31 received standard support. Higher respiratory support requirement was noted in the HCQ group after 5 days of therapy[66]. In a retrospective study on 368 veterans from the United States of America, risk of death was found to be higher in those patients who received HCQ alone compared to no HCQ. No difference in requirement of ventilation was found between HCQ and no HCQ group (",
