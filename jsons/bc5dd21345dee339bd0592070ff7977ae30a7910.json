For example, the SD scenario modeled by Kissler et al. (2020) used a 60% SD on -60% SD off approach.

            "text": "Our model indicates that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach. Such an approach involves gradual stair-step declines in SD. The approach we modeled was multiplying SD values of 40%, 30% and 20% by 1, then 1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8 and then back to 1 and repeat. Similar, to the argument made for intermittent SD a stepping-down strategy may allow for periods of transmission without burdening hospital resources. Our modal indicated that the stepping-down was more effective at maintaining control over the pandemic than intermittent SD. In addition, the modeled stepping-down strategy resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5% compared to the best intermittent and constant strategies. A 6.5% reduction in the time required to SD may have significant economic and psychological benefits. The best-case scenario indicated by our model was a stepping-down strategy with an 80-day window. That is, an 80day period in between each SD level. According to our model, this scenario prevented a second peak while the number of ICUs needed per day was within the threshold of those currently available. pandemic. In addition, the results indicate the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of ICUs needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.",
