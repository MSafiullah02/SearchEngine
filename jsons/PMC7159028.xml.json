            "text": "Coronaviruses6., 7. are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses, with a single-stranded genome of between 27 kb and 31.5 kb, the largest among known RNA viruses. The genomes of coronaviruses and related viruses in the order Nidovirales8., 9. are polycistronic and are expressed through a sophisticated combination of poorly understood regulatory mechanisms.6., 7. Coronavirus genome expression starts with the translation of two large replicase ORFs (1a and 1b; Figure 1), whose coding capacity is about twice that of the average complete +RNA virus genome. Via a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift,10 the ORF1a polyprotein (pp1a; >4000 amino acid residues) can be extended with ORF1b-encoded sequences to yield a >7000 amino acid residue pp1ab polyprotein. Replicase polyprotein processing is carried out by two or three ORF1a-encoded viral proteinases.11 The processing products are a group of largely uncharacterized (putative) replicative enzymes, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an RNA helicase that is fused to a complex N-terminal Zn-finger, and a Zn-ribbon-containing papain-like proteinase.12., 13., 14., 15. The replicase subunits are thought to assemble into a viral replication complex that is targeted to cytoplasmic membranes by various membrane-associated viral proteins.16., 17., 18. In addition to genome replication, the coronavirus replicase complex mediates the synthesis of an extensive nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (transcription) to express all ORFs downstream of ORF1b, which encode a variety of structural and accessory proteins.6., 7., 8., 9. The number and composition of these 3\u2032-proximal ORFs vary greatly among coronaviruses, but they always include genes for the structural proteins S, M, E and N, which drive cytoplasmic virus assembly. The mechanisms underlying the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs are poorly understood. To explain the composite structure of the sg mRNAs, which are both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-coterminal with the viral genome, several models have been put forward,6., 9. of which the one postulating the discontinuous synthesis of negative-stranded sg templates for sg mRNA synthesis19 has received wide support recently.",

This indicated that different regions of the coronavirus genome have indeed co-evolved and that intergroup recombination has not played a prominent role in coronavirus evolution.23 However, the agreement between the two classifications is not perfect, as some coronaviruses are sufficiently different to not have antigenic cross-reactivity with the established groups,24 but close enough to cluster with one of them (group 1) on the basis of sequence comparisons.7 Consequently, these viruses were placed into (the expanded) group 1. Here, we refer to coronavirus groups as evolutionary clusters that unite viruses not necessarily having antigenic cross-reactivity.",

Recent phylogenetic analyses of different SARS-CoV proteins using unrooted trees consistently showed that SARS-CoV does not segregate into any of the three currently established coronavirus groups.4., 5. These results were interpreted as support for the classification of SARS-CoV as the prototype of a novel, fourth group of coronaviruses.4., 5. However, in our opinion, the evidence leading to this conclusion was inconclusive and alternative interpretations, with SARS-CoV being an outlier in one of the established groups, remained possible. This uncertainty can be resolved only through the reconstruction of coronavirus evolution from its origin using a rooted phylogenetic tree, which is most reliable when an outgroup is included in the analysis. The closest known outgroup for coronaviruses are the toroviruses, which form a separate genus in the same virus family.8., 25. The ORF1b part of the replicase and the two virion proteins S and M are homologous in coronaviruses and toroviruses.26., 27., 28. Unfortunately however, the level of conservation of the S and M protein genes is so low that we consider only the phylogenetic analysis of replicase ORF1b to be truly informative.",

It should be noted, however, that the size of this genome segment (\u223c5500 nucleotides) approximates the combined size of the genes encoding the four virion-associated proteins S, M, E, and N. A fully resolved tree was obtained, with all branches supported in more than 960 out of 1000 bootstrap trials (Figure 2). The topology of this tree suggests strongly that the SARS-CoV lineage was an early split-off from the group 2 branch, which occurred after the two bifurcations that gave rise to the three major coronavirus groups (Figure 2). Accordingly, in two regions of the replicase ORF1a polyprotein, nsp1 and one of the nsp3 domains, which differentiate the three coronavirus groups, SARS-CoV contains orthologs of domains that are unique for group 2 coronaviruses (see Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material\n). The published unrooted trees for the virion proteins and 3CLpro are also compatible with this phylogeny,4., 5. although formally we cannot exclude the occurrence of recombination with other coronaviruses in very limited regions. In this respect, we would like to stress that the differences in the composition and arrangement of ORFs in the 3\u2032-proximal region of the genome (downstream of ORF1b; see Figure 1) between SARS-CoV and established group 2 coronaviruses does not contradict the above results. Group 1 coronaviruses also differ in this region through the presence of unique so-called \u201caccessory non-structural protein genes\u201d.6., 7. Some of these genes have been found to be dispensable for virus reproduction in tissue culture and/or animals.6., 7., 29. The fact that, apparently, they can be acquired or lost easily in the course of evolution indicates that these genes can not be considered reliable group markers.",

Accordingly, the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity observed between distant group-mates in group 124 may be observed between SARS-CoV and the established group 2 viruses. Thus, SARS-CoV may be the first identified representative of a larger cluster that could be called subgroup 2b, if the established group 2 coronaviruses would be referred to as subgroup 2a. The 2b cluster should include the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV, which may circulate in the field. If close relatives of SARS-CoV were to be identified in animal hosts, the virus would represent the second example of a group 2 coronavirus that may have crossed the animal\u2013human barrier. The first putative case is that of the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43),30 two viruses that are so closely related at the genetic level30., 31. that they can be considered to be the same virus species.",

This observation implies that the three cleavages in the N-terminal half of pp1a must all be performed by the conserved PL2pro,36., 47. a downstream-located paralog of PL1pro. The ortholog of this proteinase appears to dominate over PL1pro in HCoV-229E,32 and is the only active PLpro in avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV).32., 37. Immediately upstream of PL2pro, we identified a 375 amino acid residue \u201corphan domain\u201d in SARS-CoV (called SUD for SARS-CoV unique domain; Figure 1), which is not present in other coronaviruses. The corresponding ORF1a region differs profoundly among group 1 coronaviruses. In one of these viruses (TGEV), and in the group 3 IBV, this region contains just a few amino acid residues, essentially fusing PL2pro to the upstream X domain. In contrast, HCoV-229E and PEDV share a conserved domain in this position. Interestingly, nsp3 also was the main site of replicase differences between BCoV variants isolated from respiratory and intestinal samples from an animal that had died during an outbreak of fatal shipping pneumonia.20 Due to the plausible multifunctionality of nsp3, which may be involved in the control of subgenomic mRNA synthesis,13., 38. the gross internal rearrangements and point mutations in this protein may have pleiotropic effect(s) on SARS-CoV properties, including its pathogenic potential.",

Furthermore, SARS-CoV lacks counterparts for two genes inserted between replicase ORF1b and the S gene in subgroup 2a viruses (see the close-up in Figure 1).6., 7. All these ORFs (from 2 to 9b) are predicted to be expressed from sg mRNAs in SARS-CoV. In members of the genus Coronavirus and the related family Arteriviridae, all sg mRNAs are 3\u2032-coterminal with the viral genome, and contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence that is identical with that of the genome.6., 7., 9., 39. The fusion of the leader to the coding part (or \u201cbody\u201d) of each of the sg RNAs involves a discontinuous step in RNA synthesis, which is currently believed to occur during minus strand synthesis, thus producing composite subgenomic negative-stranded templates for sg mRNA synthesis (Figure 3(C)).19., 39., 40. Leader-to-body joining is guided by a base-pairing interaction involving conserved transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs; also previously termed \u201cintergenic sequences (IGSs)\u201d in coronaviruses), which are found at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic leader (leader TRS) and at the 5\u2032 end of each of the sg RNA bodies (body TRSs), often located exactly between two genes, but sometimes located within the coding sequence of an upstream gene (Figure 1, Figure 3).",

The coronavirus IBV,41 which also replicates in Vero cells, was used as control and size marker. As illustrated in Figure 3(B), the genomic RNA and all eight predicted subgenomic transcripts were detected with both SARS-CoV probes, confirming the fact that these RNAs contain both common 5\u2032-terminal and common 3\u2032-terminal sequences. Remarkably, a slight mobility shift was observed for RNAs 7 and larger of the Frankfurt-1 isolate. The subsequent sequence analysis of this virus revealed that this was due to a 45 nt in-frame deletion in ORF7b,34 probably the first documented example of SARS-CoV genetic adaptation to cell culture conditions. The confirmation of leader-body fusion sites of the SARS-CoV subgenomic mRNAs will be published elsewhere.34 Remarkably, up to four of the eight SARS-CoV subgenomic mRNAs (3, 7, 8, and 9) may be functionally bicistronic (Table 2), as observed occasionally for other coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs.6., 7.\n",

Some of the nidovirus domains may contain unique and conserved additional domains. For instance, we noted that the nidovirus ExoN homologs contain an additional conserved domain resembling a mononuclear Zn-finger (Figure 4(B)) between the universally conserved blocks I and II, which include the catalytic residues (two Asp and one Glu).51 Another Zn-finger-like module has been inserted between blocks II and III in the ExoN homolog of roniviruses, a subset of nidoviruses (data not shown).

For instance, the 2\u2032-O-MT activity could be used to produce the 5\u2032-cap of viral mRNAs, as was demonstrated for a homologous flavivirus enzyme.52 Based on a parallel with some cellular DNA-processing homologs, like exonuclease I53 and the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerases,54 it is tempting to speculate on a link between the ExoN activity and RNA proofreading, repair, and/or recombination. The first two activities are not known in RNA viruses, and recombination commonly proceeds through the copy-choice mechanism with RdRp switching templates to produce chimeric nascent chains.55 However, due to the extreme sizes of their giant genomes, coronaviruses may differ from other RNA viruses and share an unprecedented similarity with DNA-based life-forms in the mechanisms of genome biosynthesis and maintenance. If confirmed, these unusual properties would explain the preliminary reports on the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin, a drug that was shown to force other RNA viruses into \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d.56 The experimental verification of these predictions will be an important step in increasing our understanding of the functional roles these putative enzymes play in the replicative cycle of SARS-CoV and related viruses. Extensive attempts to demonstrate the 2\u2032-O-MT activity of several coronaviruses (which was also recently predicted by others57) in a 5\u2032-RNA-capping reaction have not produced conclusive evidence so far (J.Z. and A.E.G., unpublished results). This development indicates that, as before with other distant nidovirus homologs (e.g. the helicase),15 the translation of bioinformatics predictions into a functional description is likely to be a laborious and time-consuming process, involving mainly the identification of virus-specific substrates and proper assay conditions.",

When the five enzyme families listed (Figure 4) above were analyzed as a single dataset, it became apparent that representatives of these families cooperate in two nuclear intron RNA processing pathways. These pathways are functionally antagonistic: intron excision aimed at the synthesis of mature tRNA58 and the production of intron-encoded box C/D small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) from its host pre-mRNA59 (Figure 5(A)). In the first pathway, XendoU initiates a cascade of poorly characterized endo- and exonuclease reactions that may involve ExoN, a homolog of the yeast Rrp6p exosome component,60 ultimately leading to the production of mature U16 and U86 snoRNAs. Subsequently, these snoRNAs may be utilized in diverse rRNA processing events involving nucleotide methylation by fibrillarin, a 2\u2032-O-MT,61 and assisted by helicase(s).59 Strikingly, the homologs of three cellular enzymes from this pathway, encoded in the replicases of all nidoviruses except for arteriviruses, are genetically clustered in a single protein block (nsp14\u2013nsp16) immediately downstream of the RNA-helicase (nsp13) (Figure 1, Figure 4). Because of the proximity of these four domains to each other, their expression must be tightly coordinated at the level of 3CLpro proteolysis and by the upstream ORF1a/ORF1b ribosomal frameshift signal.",

It seems even more conceivable that they, alone or in concert with other enzymes like the RdRp or helicase, are involved directly in viral RNA synthesis, particularly in transcription, which, in an apparent parallel with snoRNA-driven processes,59 is guided by conserved oligonucleotide base-pairing interactions (Figure 3(C)). The viral enzymes, like their cellular counterparts, might be part of separate pathways or, alternatively, cooperate in a single pathway in which the XendoU, ExoN and 2\u2032-O-MT homologs provide RNA specificity, and the CPD and ADRP homologs modulate the pace through processing of compound(s) containing 2\u2032-phosphate groups. In this respect, we note that both the XendoU/ExoN/2\u2032-O-MT and CPD/ADRP cellular pathways start with an endoribonuclease-mediated cleavage to produce molecule(s) with 2\u2032-3\u2032-cyclic phosphate termini (Figure 5), indicating the structural basis for possible cooperation of the coronavirus homologs of these enzymes in a single pathway. The expected functional hierarchy of the five putative nidovirus enzymes (Figure 5(A)) is supported by their corresponding evolutionary conservation, with the XendoU homolog being absolutely conserved and the CPD homolog being least conserved among nidoviruses (Figure 5(B)).",

Our conclusion that SARS-CoV is distantly related to group 2 coronaviruses (Figure 2) implies that viruses from this group, in particular the extensively studied mouse hepatitis virus and its derivatives lacking non-essential CPD-like and HE genes, may be the best available models for both in vitro and in vivo studies, in particular where the synthesis of viral macromolecules and the structure and function of the replication complex are involved. A detailed comparative characterization of the BCoV/HCoV-OC43 pair may provide invaluable insights into the processes of adaptation of a non-human coronavirus to a human host, which should be highly relevant to understanding the emergence of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV genome (Figure 1) lacks genes that are common in group 2 viruses, like PL1pro and CPD-like and HE genes, but encodes a number of unique protein sequences, underlining the ability of coronaviruses to the gross evolution. The comparative studies presented here have tentatively identified both known and novel viral enzymes (Figure 1, Figure 5), most of which may be involved in RNA processing and have homologs of which the tertiary structure has been solved (Figure 1). Intriguing parallels have been drawn between these putative viral enzymes and characterized, but distant cellular homologs that will guide the functional dissection of the replicases of SARS-CoV and related viruses and may put the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective. The newly described putative enzymes of SARS-CoV double the list of potential targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling this emerging virus infection.33., 34.\n",

Also, sequences that were identified below the threshold during the last iteration were used to initiate reciprocal searches that might have resulted in new significant matches. This approach worked for all protein families described here, except for the identification of the relationship between the nidovirus ExoN family and cellular DEDD superfamily, which is known to be extremely diverse.43 In this latter case, using the MAST program,72 we found a strong match (p=3 e\u221210) between the most conserved motif III of a DEDD protein and a conserved block of the ExoN family that facilitated the identification of the two other motifs in the nidovirus proteins having a non-typical intermotif spacing partially occupied by Zn-finger(s) (see the text and Figure 4). Furthermore, we observed an approximately 30 times selective increase of the global similarity between the ExoN family and DEDD proteins, after the coronavirus sequences were modified artificially by removing putative Zn-fingers that are not present in the DEDD proteins. In the HMMER-mediated searches of >106 sequences using this Zn-finger-deficient ExoN family as a query, numerous DEDD proteins were retrieved immediately after the nidovirus proteins, starting with E=0.81. The relatively poor statistics of these hits were due to the failure by HMMER to align all three motifs.",

Close-ups of two regions with major differences are shown (and see the text). In the N-terminal half of replicase ORF1a, SARS-CoV lacks one of the PLpro domains (indicated in orange/green in BCoV) and contains a unique insertion (SUD). In the region with structural and accessory protein genes, the location of the body TRSs involved in subgenomic RNA synthesis are indicated with red boxes (see Figure 3 and Hofmann et al.76). The bottom part of the Figure illustrates which parts of the genome are conserved in the genus Coronavirus and in the order Nidovirales (the ORF1a sequence of toroviruses, which largely remains to be sequenced, could not be included).

Our in-depth comparative sequence analysis (see Materials and Methods) revealed a statistically significant relationship between functionally uncharacterized proteins (domains) of nidoviruses, including SARS-CoV, and five protein families that include enzymes involved in two nuclear RNA processing pathways: intron excision to produce mature tRNA58 and the production of intron-encoded box C/D small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) from its host pre-mRNA (Figure 5).59 Shown are alignments for key regions of a few selected members of the following groups of enzymes: (A) XendoU family; (B) ExoN family; (C) 2\u2032-O-MT family; (D) CPD family; and (E) ADRP family. These protein families may be known also under other names. Cellular homologs, not necessarily including proteins involved in the discussed RNA processing pathways, are listed in the top segment of each alignment and nidovirus proteins in the bottom segment. In the CPD family, along with group 2 coronavirus representatives, proteins of two rotaviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses), which were identified in this study, are listed.
