The intertwining complexity of these pathogens with their diverse tissue tropisms, direct effects on host cells, multiphasic immunological responses, and additional in fl uence of superimposed secondary agents is beyond the expertise of a single discipline in modern medicine. A combined evaluation of patient's history, clinical manifestations, and physical examination may suggest a list of differential diagnosis, but it is often insuf fi cient to determine the speci fi c infectious etiology. Laboratory methods are essential to identify an etiologic agent from testing clinical samples, such as blood, serum, nasopharyngeal swab, etc. These methods, including traditional microbiological techniques, conventional immunological assays, and modern molecular methods, remain the mainstay in today's practice of clinical microbiology and infectious disease medicine. Nevertheless, there are technical and logistic issues associated with these methods, and the test results often lack a clinicopathologic correlation that can confound the interpretation of their clinical signi fi cance. For example, microbiological culture may fail to grow a causative organism, while the organism isolated by the laboratory in vitro may arise from contamination and does not represent the actual infective agent in vivo.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Pathology plays a key role as a bridging subspecialty in such multidisciplinary approach.

Using these tissue samples as the source for laboratory workup, pathologists have made various contributions to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases in diagnostics, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical aspects of these diseases (Table 45 .1 ). In addition, results from pathologic studies can help design better strategies for control and prevention of these emerging infectious diseases, especially when they occur as an outbreak [ 5, 6 ] .

Interpretation of these special stains performed on tissue sections is usually more dif fi cult than those performed on cultures because the coexistence of host tissue responses and accompanied histopathologic changes in the sections can confound the interpretation.

A large number of IHC is available that can be helpful in the identi fi cation of microorganisms. By using a variety of antibodies, IHC can detect the presence of microbial antigens in tissue specimens, whether they represent the intact or degraded pathogens, and whether they are intracellular or extracellular (Fig. 45.2c ) . Therefore, IHC has become a powerful technique used by pathologists for tissue diagnosis of infectious diseases. There are many ways to visualize an antibody-antigen interaction. The most common method is to apply an antibody conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase [28] [29] [30] or alkaline phosphatase [ 31, 32 ] , which can further catalyze a reaction for colorimetric detection. The antibodies used for speci fi c detection can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Polyclonal antibodies are a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies that recognize several epitopes of a speci fi c organism or more commonly, a group of related organisms. Monoclonal antibodies are generated against a single epitope and hence more speci fi c to the target antigen than polyclonal antibodies. Many of these antibodies are commercially available and are widely used in diagnostic pathology laboratories. Others, especially those antibodies for detecting novel emerging pathogens, are available only at highly specialized centers such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new IHC is a worthwhile but usually labor-intensive task. Similar to all other laboratory assays, the sensitivity and speci fi city of any IHC always need a careful evaluation before establishing its status as a diagnostic assay. Detection of two or more target antigens on one slide can be achieved with multiple staining IHC assays [33] [34] [35] . These assays can expand the information obtained from each slide and reduce turnaround-time compared to single staining or sequential staining methods. It is possible to assess the topographic relationship of the targets by using multiple staining IHC assays for determining the cellular tropism of viral infection with antibodies raised against virus and speci fi c cellular markers respectively (Fig. 45.1c ) .

Similarly, adequate tissue sampling is the fi rst and the most important step to obtain an organism-speci fi c diagnosis of infectious diseases by using pathology techniques. The pathology laboratory must have practical guidelines for optimal specimen collection and handling, and should communicate this information to the clinical staff and patient care sites. It is prudent to obtain biopsy or surgical samples from the precise site of infection and preferably before initiation of therapy to minimize the impact of treatment on subsequent diagnostic tests. This is particularly true for bacterial or fungal infections. Tissue specimens obtained surgically are acquired at great expense and pose considerable risk to the patient; therefore they should be procured with an amount of material adequate for both histopathologic and microbiological examination. Swabs are rarely adequate for this purpose. Representative samples from all major organs should be collected in autopsy cases, especially those unexplained fatal cases due to infectious causes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Guidelines of Using Pathology Techniques"}, {"text": "Etiologic pathogens may be focally or sparsely present in involved organs and only a complete postmortem examination can attentively localize the causative organisms, as well as the full spectrum of their pathologic effects. In addition, the predilection site for infection may vary among different organisms. For example, herpes simplex virus tends to involve temporal lobe in the brain more frequently, while West Nile virus usually causes more severe infection in brain stem and spinal cord. Moreover, since multiple organs can be involved in the context of systemic diseases, collecting multiple representative portions of target organs with syndromebased approach (Table 45. 3 ) and tissue samples from any other organ system with fi ndings suggestive of infection ensures the best chance of detecting the causative agent. In fl uenza-associated myocarditis is a good example to show the dif fi culty of identifying in fl uenza virus in the heart tissue even with prominent histopathologic changes of myocarditis, while the evidence of infection is usually present in the respiratory tissues [ 81 ] . FFPE tissue samples are usually adequate for routine H&E stain, special stains, IHC, and ISH assays. However, prolonged formalin fi xation can cause cross-linking of proteins and nucleic acids in tissues and hence decrease the sensitivity of IHC, ISH, or PCR assays. In general, antigens and nucleic acids in tissue samples can be well preserved in paraf fi n-embedded blocks if formalin fi xation does not exceed 2 weeks. It is highly recommended to embed tissue samples in paraf fi n no longer than 72 h after adequate formalin fi xation. Although FFPE blocks can also be used for ultrastructural examination, it is preferably to dissect tissue samples into small thin pieces (1 mm 3 ), placed in glutaraldehyde fi xative, and stored in a refrigerator for optimal EM studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1097, "end": 1103, "text": "[ 81 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 669, "end": 679, "text": "(Table 45.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "General Guidelines of Using Pathology Techniques"}, {"text": "Sterile techniques are mandatory to obtain target tissue samples for microbiologic culture and PCR assays.

Therefore, autopsy should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 12 h after death) to minimize these postmortem confounding factors. Representative tissue samples for potential PCR assay should be obtained with sterile technique and frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C.

If the tissue specimens are not obtained from relevant lesions or areas with histopathologic changes, the subsequent tests performed on such specimens can all result in falsenegative outcomes. Timing of tissue sampling, as mentioned earlier, is another crucial element that can affect test results. Delayed autopsy procedure increases the chance of tissue autolysis and postmortem contamination, which can signi fi cantly interfere with histopathologic evaluation and all related pathologic tests. Technical issues, such as sensitivity and speci fi city, are universally present for each IHC, ISH, or PCR testing.
