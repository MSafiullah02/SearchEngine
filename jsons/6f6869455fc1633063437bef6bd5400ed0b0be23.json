In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care",

In addition, Semba et al 12 had reported that vitamin A supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, measles-related pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and malaria. Vitamin A supplementation also offers some protection against the complications of other life-threatening infections, including malaria, lung diseases, and HIV. 13 Jee et al 14 had reported that low vitamin A diets might compromise the effectiveness of inactivated bovine coronavirus vaccines and render calves more susceptible to infectious disease. The effect of infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a kind of coronaviruses, was more pronounced in chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in vitamin A than in those fed a diet adequate in vitamin A. 15 The mechanism by which vitamin A and retinoids inhibit measles replication is upregulating elements of the innate immune response in uninfected bystander cells, making them refractory to productive infection during subsequent rounds of viral replication. 16 Therefore, vitamin A could be a promising option for the treatment of this novel coronavirus and the prevention of lung infection.",

Vitamin B2 deficiency had been suspected to occur among US elderly. 17 Keil et al 18 had reported that vitamin B2 and UV light effectively reduced the titer of MERS-CoV in human plasma products. Vitamin B3, also called nicotinamide, could enhance the killing of Staphylococcus aureus through a myeloid-specific transcription factor and vitamin B3 was efficacious in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. 19 Moreover, vitamin B3 treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the lungs with a strong anti-inflammatory effect during ventilatorinduced lung injury. However, it also paradoxically led to the development of significant hypoxemia. 20 Vitamin B6 is also needed in protein metabolism and it participates in over 100 reactions in body tissues. In addition, it also plays important role in body immune function as well. As shortage of B vitamins may weaken host immune response, they should be supplemented to the virus-infected patients to enhance their immune system. Therefore, B vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of COVID-19.",

It has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV. 94 As compared to emodin, promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of S protein to ACE2. These findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit SARS-CoV infectivity through blocking the interaction of S protein and ACE2. 93 Therefore, the monoclonal antibody (scFv80R), chloroquine, emodin, and promazine could be used as alternative choices for the treatment of COVID-19.",

In addition, CR3014 could be used as prophylaxis for SARS coronavirus infection in ferrets. 136 However, CR3014 was found to be able to block the interaction in parent SARS-CoV strain, but not in escape variants. This led to the ineffectiveness of CR3014 to prevent infection in humans. CR3022 was another monoclonal antibody and it had been found to neutralize CR3014 escape viruses. 136 The combination of CR3014 and CR3022 had also been reported to have the potential to control immune escape. 135 However, the clinical trial of CR3022 with CR3014 had never been tried due to the high cost of manufacturing.",

Moreover, Tan et al had tested the inhibition of SARS coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs. Theyfound that the complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of the virus was observed with specific subtypes (\u03b2-1b, \u03b1-n1, \u03b1-n3, and human leukocyte interferon \u03b1) in culture.52 Haagmans et al 54 also reported in vivo that pegylated recombinant IFN-\u03b12b, a registered drug for chronic hepatitis C, 53 could protect type 1 pneumocytes against SARS coronavirus infection in monkeys (macaques). The drug given at 3 days before infection could reduce viral replication and lung damage as compared with the control monkeys.55 It was also considered as a candidate drug for SARS therapy at that time and the effectiveness of synthetic recombinant IFN-\u03b1 for the treatment of SARS patients was demonstrated in a pilot clinical trial.",

We have found that the general treatments are very important to enhance host immune response against RNA viral infection. The immune response has often been shown to be weakened by inadequate nutrition in many model systems as well as in human studies. However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered as a contributing factor to the emergence of viral infectious diseases. Therefore, we propose to verify the nutritional status of COVID-19 infected patients before the administration of general treatments. In addition, we also found coronavirus-specific treatments and antiviral treatments were very useful for the treatment of SARS and MERS. They should also beconsidered as potential treatments for COVID-19 infection. The other compounds should also be chosen as alternative options for the treatment as well as new drug designs. To complete the eradication of virus infection, the COVID-19related vaccines are warranted. The vaccine development for SARS had already attracted the attention of many scientists in the past. Avian IBV is similar to SARS-CoV and both viruses belong to coronavirus. IBV is in group 3 and SARS belongs to group 4. 131 Bijlenga et al 55 had suggested that avian live virus IBV vaccine (strain H) be used to treat SARS in 2005. However, preliminary tests in monkeys should be taken before the startup. Interestingly, children are seldom attacked by COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV. It may be due to the required vaccine program for every child. The RNA-virus vaccines and the adjuvants in vaccine programs may help children escape from the infection. Therefore, the RNA-virus-related vaccines including measles (MeV), polio, Japanese encephalitis virus, influenza virus, and rabies-related vaccines, could be used as the most promising alternative choices to prevent human-to-human transmission through immunizing health care workers and noninfected population as well.Recombinant measles vaccine expressing S protein of SARS and",
