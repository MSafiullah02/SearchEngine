Influenza occurs in every climate and latitude. In Central Europe, the incidence of influenza and influenza-like illnesses usually starts increasing from January to March (Globinska and Kowalski 2012; Brydak 2008). In Poland, the number of cases of influenza and influenza-like illnesses in a single season varies from a few thousands to several million (Globinska and Kowalski 2012; Brydak 2008; Romanowska and Brydak 2007). The recorded cases are tallied from the reports of family doctors who are on the frontline of contact with patients. Depending on the number of cases they report, the epidemiological and virological interpretation is conducted on a national scale as well as a comparative evaluation on a global scale.",

For many years, medicine has been using molecular biology methods of a rapid viral diagnosis that is beneficial not only for the individual patient but also results in the economic benefits for the country (Van-Tam and Sellwood 2013). The most cost-effective way to combat influenza is prevention and vaccination. Viruses infecting epithelial cells of the respiratory tract cause a diverse defense response of the organism and try in different ways to avoid the immune mechanisms aimed at eliminating infectious agents (Globinska and Kowalski 2012). An understanding of ways by which viruses avoid body\u2019s antiviral response may serve as a tool for developing new methods for treatment of respiratory diseases. The integrated epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance system conducted in Poland (Brydak et al 2013; Wozniak-Kosek and Brydak 2013), as well as international projects such as I-MOVE, significantly contribute to the evaluation of the spread of the influenza and other respiratory viruses in the population investigated. Such programs also allow assessing and comparing the epidemiological and virological situation in different countries, which results in a greater awareness of vaccinations, such as against influenza.",
