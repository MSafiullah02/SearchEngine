AMPV belongs to the subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus Metapneumovirus [3] of which four subtypes have been recognized (A, B, C and D) [4], [5], [6]. The genome has 8 genes, with genome sizes typically close to 13.5 kb [7]. Reverse genetics (RG) systems for subtypes A and C have allowed their rational mutation [8], [9]. To date RG has produced viruses with deletions, gene modifications and reporter gene insertions [8], [10], [11], [12]. Some studies have considered the replicative ability of recombinants in vivo [11], [12] but not foreign viral gene insertion, nor the genetic stability of expanded genomes.",

IBV epidemiology is characterized by the emergence of virulent variants which evade prevailing IBV immunity. In the last decade the QX genotype [14] has emerged, which predominantly affects the respiratory tract and kidneys [15]. It was first recognised in China and has continued to spread to much of Europe and Asia. In this study, novel QX candidate vaccines based on AMPV vectors were constructed and tested.",

Colonies containing DNA of correct orientation and sequence were selected by sequencing. FLs containing GFP were recovered by RG [9]. GFP expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the minimal levels of upper respiratory tract replication detected in our study, led to the observed protection. Therefore any AMPV recombinant replicating better might yield greater protection. Growing worldwide commercial field evidence is indicating that subtype B AMPV better infects commercial chickens than subtype A. If a subtype B RG system becomes available, protection afforded by any resultant IBV recombinants will be keenly compared to the current study, which counter-intuitively suggests that recombinant AMPVs inducing the best protection replicate least well. If more protection inducing recombinants are found not to appreciably replicate in the respiratory tract or produce generalised seroconversion, it will become necessary to investigate whether replication might occur at another site or alternatively protection may result from a yet unrecognized mechanism. There is already some evidence that, AMPV replication in the respiratory tract of turkeys does not imply induction of AMPV protection [12], protection following live vaccination does not require initial replication in the trachea [28] and AMPV vaccination can lead to apparent protection without AMPV seroconversion [29], [30].",

Previously AMPVs were shown highly stable both in cell culture and during natural passage [20] as has also been reported for other members of the Mononegavirales such as vesicular stomatitis and rabies viruses [31], [32]. This contrasts with single strand positive viruses such as IBV and feline calicivirus where minimal passage readily results in consensus sequence mutations [13], [33]. Furthermore, the recombinant AMPV genome carrying more than 3000 extra nucleotides (IBV S1 and N genes) was stable with respect to functionally irrelevant inserted genes, and their presence did not appreciably reduce virus viability, if distanced beyond the phosphoprotein gene.",

For IBV, this is in marked contrast to conventional attenuation where more than 100 egg passages is typically required. Such AMPV recombinants would have greater genetic stability in two key respects. Firstly instability on simple passage implies that any live vaccine will be genetically heterogeneous. Of greater significance is the ability of IBV live vaccines to recombine with other IBV genotypes during co-infection, via homologous recombination, thus potentially leading to new field genotypes. In contrast, AMPV has been shown to be stable with respect to multiple passage while the absence (or extremely low frequency) of homologous recombination avoids recombinant generation.",

While virus AvF containing N gene alone or N + S1 genes together protected tracheas better than AvF containing the S1 gene alone, the expression of the inserted genes would need to be quantified, before conclusions about the relative contribution of each gene to protection, could be drawn. Previous studies indicate that the internal N protein is able to stimulate a cell mediated immune response (CMI) [18] whereas the exposed S1 protein would be more likely to stimulate antibody production [34], [35], [36], hence our study adds weight to the notion that both a CMI and antibody response are important in protection.",
