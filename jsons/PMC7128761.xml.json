The current study was designed to investigate the prevalence, phenotype and potential cause(s) of CVD in Sumatran tiger cubs, within the Australasian region. The aims of the study were to define the phenotype of CVD in captive Sumatran tigers, and to determine the heritability of this disorder and its potential mode of inheritance (MOI).",

In six cases, in which vestibulo-ocular reflexes were assessed, the strabismus was specifically noted to be positional. The other abnormalities documented included circling with loss of balance (n = 11) and reduced menace response (n = 6). In addition, seven affected cubs abducted their limbs and ventrally flexed their necks when raised from the ground with their pelvises at the highest point, accompanied by exaggeration of the head tilt. The duration and severity of clinical signs varied between cases. Five of the affected cubs had intermittent episodes of clinical signs, whereas clinical signs were persistent in all other cases. The majority of cases (n = 11) had complete resolution of clinical signs between the ages of 3 and 12 months.

Some cubs showed intermittent episodes of vestibular dysfunction that resolved spontaneously. This might reflect exacerbation of well compensated deficits following stress, or alternatively could represent an intermittent disorder. A syndrome in humans, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC), has similar features with CVD in Sumatran tigers. Brief but intense periods of ataxia and nystagmus are the hallmark signs of BPVC and symptoms often resolve before sexual maturity (Balatsouras et al., 2007). Neurological examination and vestibular function are normal between episodes in these patients (Ralli et al., 2009). The pathogenesis of BPVC is poorly understood but one proposed mechanism is impaired vascular perfusion to the vestibular nuclei and associated neurological pathways (Ralli et al., 2009).",

However, in these reports, sample sizes were small, and reference ranges for juvenile non-domesticated felids have not been established. Florida panther nursing cubs have been shown to have lower serum retinol concentrations than adults (Dunbar et al., 1999). Vitamin A deficiency in captive lions has been associated with calvarial hyperostosis and cerebellar herniation (Chandra et al, 1999, Hartley et al, 2005). However, the calvaria of affected tiger cubs in the present study were considered to be normal on radiography. This, and the observation that no dietary deficiencies were apparent, suggests that vitamin A deficiency is unlikely to be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of CVD in Sumatran tiger cubs. Since 90% of total body vitamin A is stored in the liver, hepatic levels are the most reliable indicator of vitamin A status (Schweigert et al., 1990). Future investigations should include determination of hepatic vitamin A levels by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet retinoid analysis, as has been described in lions (Shamir et al., 2012).",

No microbial agents were visualised on examination of the CSF and the lack of eosinophils in the CSF suggests that parasitic or protozoan infections are unlikely. Otoscopic, radiographic and MRI examinations of the external and middle ear did not support otitis media and interna as a contributing factor to this disease. Although no tigers were specifically tested for canine distemper virus (CDV), the lack of disease progression suggests that this is an unlikely cause and there was no evidence of suggestive lesions at necropsy.

Segregation analysis suggested that the trait has complete penetrance, although the disorder was not observed for two generations and then manifested in a subsequent generation, which is inconsistent with a fully penetrant dominant trait. Despite the segregation analysis indicating complete penetrance, there may have been too few animals included for a robust analysis. The research findings reported here reflect a common difficulty with segregation analysis, in that the data provided by the analysis may not be in agreement with the observations made or not compatible with any one type of inheritance.
