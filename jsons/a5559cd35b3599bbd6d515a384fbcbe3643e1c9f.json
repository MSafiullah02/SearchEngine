Concern about a possible pandemic was based on a number of factors. First, given the wide-ranging fl ight paths of migratory birds, the virus had the potential to be spread to domestic poultry in a number of countries. Second, there was concern that the H 5 N 1 virus could mutate rapidly when it existed within a large contained domestic fl ock. Third, the close contact that occurs in many Asian countries between humans and domestic poultry provided numerous opportunities for the virus to infect humans through direct contact with infected poultry or surfaces that had been contaminated by infected birds. Fourth, the lack of a vaccine combined with the lack of natural immunity to H 5 N 1 amongst the world's population created the opportunity for a pandemic to occur . Fifth, the avian infl uenza outbreak in north Sumatra raised signifi cant concerns about whether countries were prepared to respond to an avian infl uenza outbreak and capable of doing so in a manner that results in the control of local outbreaks (Butler 2006 ).",

In order to develop appropriate communication strategies, we need to fully understand the target audiences' knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, concerns and current behaviours. This can only be achieved by extensive and appropriate market research with the different target audiences. \u2022 There is a need to select and infl uence the target audience : Market segmentation is a key component of effective social marketing, as we know that different market segments and different needs and will respond to different appeals. In the case of a potential pandemic such as bird fl u, it is obviously important to target the entire population; however, some segments will be seen to be of higher priority (e.g., health care workers, international travellers, persons in low income housing units, domestic poultry farmers) and different strategies will need to be used to ensure we reach, and persuade, all groups within the population. \u2022 There is a need to incorporate all 4Ps of the marketing mix: An effective strategy to engage the population in the appropriate responses to reduce the impact of a pandemic requires a careful consideration of the 4Ps.

Second, the initial emphasis on avian infl uenza followed by the apparent reduction in coverage had the potential to artifi cially reassure the general public that avian infl uenza no longer posed a threat to Australia.

There was no discussion of actions that domestic poultry farmers or the poultry industry could take. Further, much of the media coverage stated, or at least implied, that Australia would be well prepared to handle a potential pandemic. Finally, a high proportion of articles suggested that appropriate treatments were currently available or would become available in time, thereby implying that Australia had the ability to ameliorate the effects of an avian pandemic.

The revised Phase One was much more effective than the initial execution.

The transition from Paper People in Phase One to the use of the real people and a more serious tone in Phase Two worked well and was perceived as consistent by participants -that is, a different messenger but the same message. Participants reported that having a real person at this stage was very reassuring, and made them feel that someone was taking charge. Both the Chief Medical Offi cer (CMO) role and the man himself had credibility and gravitas and his measured, calm tone was perceived as reassuring; the inclusion of Fiona Stanley (an eminent Australian epidemiologist and physician) was endorsed as demonstrating to the public that a team is in place and working on the problem.

Such a Phase I Campaign would be strategically important -both in addressing the public's current level of complacency and in enabling the government to be seen to have acted -but a need exists to clearly communicate both the wash message and the need to take preventative actions prior to the confi rmation of cases in local population. In later stages of a pandemic (i.e., where cases have been confi rmed within a country or a region), communication campaigns need to effectively communicate the key messages for each stage of pandemic and motivate the public to engage in the correct preventive actions without creating unnecessary panic in the community. As such, these measures shift across both preventative and tertiary paradigms. They support a positive (and well-informed) perception of quality of life (Skevington 2002 ) , by strengthening people's confi dence and capacity for action to reduce the risk of infection. Similarly, support for broader mechanisms that enable personal and social well-being, such as fi nancial security, supportive relationships, and reduced discrimination maintain the potential for a healthy quality of life to be maintained at community level when the risk of infection is high and compounded by other challenges such as HIV/AIDS (Basavaraj et al. 2010 ; Horwood et al. 2015 ) .",

Second, the government must have clearly identifi ed control measures that the public can take prior to and during a bird fl u outbreak, and have a strategy for communicating these measures in an effective manner to the public. Third, the government will need to convince persons that they need to comply with all of the recommended control measures, not just those that they personally believe are important. Fourth, the government must have an effective communication strategy directed at medical personnel who are likely to encounter persons concerned about bird fl u. This is important as in the SARS outbreak medical personnel were found to have critical gaps in their knowledge (Deng et al. 2006 ) . Fifth, the communication strategy should try to create a sense of social responsibility and empathy amongst the population as this may increase the likelihood that they will comply with all the recommended control measures (Nickell et al. 2004 ) and support others facing multiple challenges. Sixth, the government must carefully select the persons and/or organizations that will have responsibility for being the 'public face' of any media campaign. Our results indicate medical personnel and medical organizations are likely to be perceived by the public as being the most credible sources for delivering bird fl u messages. And, fi nally, there should be at least two components of any communication strategyone that prepares persons in the event of a bird fl u outbreak, and one that directs persons to take specifi c actions during the actual outbreak.",

Additionally, in the case of a pandemic, a need exists to go beyond education/marketing.
