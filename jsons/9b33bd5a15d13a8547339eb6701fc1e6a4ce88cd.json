Marked trends in successionai repiacement aiong tiie river cotirse are confined to tiie scarce species of Ephemeroptera and the absence of longitudinai zonation in the distribution of some common species is related to the topographical characteristics of the system. A distitict successionai trend by one species is attributed to its intolerance to the iower temperatures at iiigh aititudes. Major discontinuities in distribution are found between the Ephemeroptera of the main river and certain tributaries. The paticity of certain otherwise abundant species in one region is reiated to siit deposition resulting from sand and gravel excavation.",

Organisms disturbed by this procedure were swept into the net by the current. Large stones were removed by hand and washed into the net. A lO-min period was taken to complete a series of twenty such sub-samples. These together constituted one collection which sampled an approximate area of 5 m^. Although restricted to shallow water, this method can be operated under adverse and variable conditions and provides comparable results on a relative basis.

As the overlap between these species coincided precisely with the outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone which characterizes the 'coastal plain*, there is, therefore, evidence to support the view held by Macan (1961) that H. lateraiis replaces H. sulphurea in non calcareous areas. One individual of Caenis horaria was obtained from Station 5. This is typically a still-water form (Macan, 1970) .",
