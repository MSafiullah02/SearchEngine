ACE2 can act on Ang I and generate Ang (1-9), then they can generate Ang (1-7) through dependent or independent ACE2 pathways, or ACE2 can directly hydrolyze Ang II to Ang (1-7), in which Ang (1-7) can bind to G protein-coupled Mas receptors to mediate vasodilation, antioxidant stress; inhibit cell proliferation; protect vascular endothelium damage as well as other physiological functions, like delaying or reversing vascular remodeling and protecting the cardiovascular system. ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis antagonize and balance each other to maintain the dynamic balance of human vascular system. ACE2 is expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells, and I which is not only the gateway of virus invasion, but also mediates lung injury and lung failure caused by virus infection. Clinical observations showed that plasma Ang II levels increased significantly in COVID-19 patients [5] , which further suggests that COVID-19 binding to ACE2 leads to excessive release of Ang II through RAS, which in turn burdens heart and vascular system, by increasing heart loading, eventually cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and high blood pressure.",

The hypoxemia, respiratory distress, inflammatory storms caused by COVID-19 have adverse effects on the heart, and we should pay more attention to the cardiovascular damage induced by COVID-19. Early identification, timely and effective treatment, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance to alleviate the disease, save lives, and ensure long-term prognosis.",
