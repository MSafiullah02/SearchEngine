            "text": "Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) causes watery diarrhoea, dehydration, and a high mortality rate among suckling pigs. Recently, PEDV had a large negative economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and North America. In 2014, PEDV reemerged in many European countries, but most countries only reported a few sporadic cases. Here, we report the epidemic wave that occurred in Italy from 2015 to 2017. During this time, PEDV was detected by real-time PCR in 438 farms located mainly in the high-density pig production area in Northern Italy. Most of the outbreaks were in farrow-to-finish, farrow-to-wean and finisher farms. Clinical signs were observed mainly in suckling and fattening animals, while mortality rates were higher in piglets, reaching 50%. A sequence analysis showed that a PEDV strain, similar to the OH851 S-INDEL strain isolated in the USA in January 2014, was responsible for the outbreaks in Italy in 2015 and 2016. However, from January 2017, a recombinant variant strain, containing a portion of the Swine Enteric Coronavirus in the S1 gene, spread and almost completely outcompeted the previous nonrecombinant strain. In total, 14.1% of the environmental swabs collected from trucks at slaughterhouses after animals were unloaded tested positive for PEDV before the trucks were cleaned and disinfected, and 46% remained positive after cleaning and disinfection processes were performed. Moreover, environmental swabs indicated that 17.3% of the empty trucks arriving at the farms to load animals were PEDV-positive. This study indicates that trucks can have an important role in the spread of PEDV in Italy.",

Since May 2013, PED has become an epidemic in the USA (Stevenson et al., 2013) , causing huge economic losses in swine production. Distinct viral strains have been identified in the USA. The highly virulent PEDV strain associated with severe outbreaks (Stevenson et al., 2013) is called \"US original\" or \"non-S-INDEL\", in reference to the S-INDEL, which shows minimal to no clinical signs (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014b) and is characterized by insertions and deletions in the spike (S) gene. Additionally, another coronavirus, genetically distinct from PEDV and similar to that detected in Hong Kong in 2011 (Woo et al., 2012) , has been identified. This virus, called Porcine Delta Coronavirus (PDCoV), (Marthaler et al., 2014) has been found with a relatively high viral load, often in association with PEDV in farms experiencing acute diarrhoea in sows and piglets (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014a) .",

            "text": "In Italy, PED has been present since the early 90s, and its spread has been increasing as infections caused by the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus, TGEV) decreases. After the severe epidemic of 2005 -2006 (Martelli et al., 2008 , sporadic outbreaks, characterized by mild symptoms and mortality rates slightly above the average, have occurred from 2007 to 2014 . A high level of genetic variability was observed among the strains circulating in Italy during that period . In particular, a novel coronavirus generated by recombination between PEDV and TGEV, called Swine Enteric Coronavirus (SeCoV), was identified. SeCoV was circulating in Italy from 2009 to 2012, was found in Germany (Akimkin et al., 2016) in 2012, and has recently been detected in Central Eastern Europe (Belsham et al., 2016) . In July 2014, two new cases of PED, with mild clinical signs, were reported . Based on the S1 gene sequence, these new strains have a high identity with the American strain S-INDEL OH851, which is defined as being less virulent. Since the end of 2014, PED has also been reported in Belgium (Theuns et al., 2015) , Germany , the Netherlands (Van Wolf et al., 2015) , France (Grasland et al., 2015) , Spain (EFSA, 2016), Slovenia (Toplak et al., 2016) , Austria (Steinrigl et al., 2015) , and Portugal (Mesquita et al., 2015) , and strains genetically related to the American S-INDEL strain have been identified in all of these countries. However, the virulent American prototype strain has only been identified in the Ukraine (Dastjerdi, Carr, Ellis, Steinbach, & Williamson, 2015) .",

In Italy, PEDV was first reported in July 2014 and, since the beginning of 2015, a large number of PED outbreaks have occurred (531 out of 1,210 cases of enteritis), with peaks in the winter months. Outbreaks were observed in all of the farm production types but mainly in the fattening and farrow-to-wean farms. The typical clinical signs of PED were observed mainly in suckling and fattening animals, but patterns and severity levels differed. Watery diarrhoea with the presence of mucus and blood was observed in piglets, as well as in gestating and farrowing sows (Bertasio et al., 2016) . In this study, 31% of herds with suckling pigs and 54% of herds with fattening pigs showed outbreaks in which more than 50% of the animals were diarrhoeic. The durations of disease's clinical signs were variable, ranging from a few days to up to 9 weeks (Bertasio et al., 2016) . The mortality rates were higher in piglets, varying from 0% to 50%. These figures are similar to those reported in other European countries in the same period (Mesquita et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2015; Steinrigl et al., 2015) and are in agreement with the EFSA Report of 2016, which indicated that the mortality was higher in the suckling piglet age group, with a mean of 18%, ranging from 0% to 84%.",

As a consequence of the swine vesicular disease outbreaks, which occurred in Italy in 2010, strict biosecurity measures, in particular the cleaning and disinfection of vehicles at slaughterhouse after animal unloading, were adopted. However, this study indicates that these measures are not effective enough to completely eliminate PED contamination from trucks. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus can still be detected by RT-PCR even after disinfection with several commercially available disinfectants (Bowman et al., 2015) . In particular, during the winter months, when the virus titres in the faeces from infected animals are high (C t < 25), these procedures reduced but did not completely eliminate the virus in 46% of the examined trucks that had tested positive prior to cleaning. The presence of the PEDV genome may not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious viral particles.",

Additionally, between January and June 2015, 1,112 samples (878 stools and 234 tissues) from 200 farms were analysed using a commercial kit (EZ-PED/TGE/PDCoV; Tetracore, Rockville, MD, USA) for the detection of TGEV, PDCoV, and PEDV. To confirm the presence of the S-INDEL variant, the sequence of a portion (564 nt) of the S1 gene, 20,570-21,134 nt, which is referred to as the CV777 sequence (Accession number AF353511) was obtained from each new PEDV-positive herd and from herds with a PEDV reinfection if more than 5 months had elapsed from when PEDV was first detected. RT-PCR was performed by adding 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA to 20 \u03bcl of the OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIA-GEN, Hilden, Germany) reaction mixture containing 0.4 \u03bcM of each primer (PEDV_S_1F: GGTAAGTTGCTAGTGCGTAA and PEDV_S_1R: TCCCATGTTATGCCGACAA). The amplification was carried out at 50\u00b0C for 30 min for the RT reaction, followed by the activation of the Hot-start DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 15 min and by 45 cycles in three steps: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 51\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. An additional extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C was added at the end of the run. The PCR products were purified using NucleoSpin \u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up reagents (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and were subjected to nucleotide sequence analyses. Cycle sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye \u00ae Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were purified using a BigDye XTerminator \u2122 purification kit (Applied Biosystems) and sequenced on a 3500xL genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences were assembled using the SeqMan module of the DNASTAR software package (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession nos. MH028493-MH028607. The nucleotide sequences were aligned to 32 selected PEDV sequences available from the Gen-Bank database using ClustalW software implemented in BioEdit, version 7.2.5",

            "text": "After two initial sporadic outbreaks in mid-2014, PED started rapidly spread beginning in January 2015 in a high-density pig production area of North Italy. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus was detected by real-time PCR in 438 farms located mainly in the Po Valley with only a few in the rest of Italy (Figure 1). Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea outbreaks occurred mainly during the winter months and three epidemic peaks were observed based on the samples received: February-April 2015, December 2015-March 2016, and December 2016-March 2017 (Figure 2). Between January and June 2015, 200 farms were also tested for the presence TGEV and PDCoV, but no samples tested positive for these viruses. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus reinfection cases, which were registered even in fattening farms where the all-in-all-out system is applied, occurred in 24.31% and 22.96% of the previously infected herds during the second and third epidemics, respectively. Of the 531 positive holdings, 268 were finisher, 23 farrow-to-finish, 142 farrow-to-wean, 87 wean-to-finish, two family holdings, and nine unknowns. Clinical symptoms were observed in animals of all ages, but the most severe signs and the highest percentages of diarrhoeal animals (more than 50%) were observed in the fattening and piglet groups (Figure 3). The mortality rate was higher in piglets, with peaks of up to 50% (Figure 4). To detect the PEDV variants circulating in Italy, the N-terminal region of the S1 gene, containing insertions and deletions that distinguish S-INDEL from non-S-INDEL strains, was analysed in each new positive herd and from herds with PEDV reinfection (if more than 5 months had elapsed since PEDV was first detected). The PEDV strain type was identified in 491 samples (434 stools, 15 rectal swabs, and 42 intestines/intestinal contents) out of 531 positive PEDV samples, which came from 403 of the 438 farms. Because of technical problems, such as low titre or degraded sample, the S1 gene could not be sequenced in 40 samples. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 115 strains (excluding identical and/or partial nucleotide sequences) found in Italy and 32 sequences available in the NCBI database (Supporting Information Figure S1). The strains from Italy were divided into two clusters. In total, 360 of 491 (73.3%) showed a high degree of similarity (97.6%-100%) with the European S-INDEL strains circulating in 2014-2015 (Figure 2). The other 131 sequences (26.7%) exhibited a high degree of identity (98.6%-99.8%) with the PEDV SLOreBAS-1 strain identified in Slovenia in 2015 (KY019623) and in Hungary in 2016(Valko et al., 2017). This strain harbours a recombinant S1 gene containing a fragment of~400 nt that has a high identity with SeCoV, an already recombinant strain. In this study, the recombinant PEDV/SeCoV strain was first detected in May 2016 (three out of 131), but was mostly detected in samples procured afterFigure 2). The proportions of PED cases caused by the recombinant PEDV/SeCoV variant that occurred in January, February, March, and April 2017 were 73.4%, 74,5%, 80%, and 93.75%, respectively, which made it the most widespread PEDV strain in Italy.",

The S-INDEL PEDV strains, recombinant PEDV/SeCoV strains and unavailable sequences are shown with black, grey, and white, respectively. SeCoV, Swine Enteric Coronavirus disinfection operations were performed. In addition, 81 out of 1,091 (7.4%) environmental swabs of the same trucks, collected after routine cleaning and disinfection operations, tested positive for the virus. Of the 154 trucks that had originally tested positive, 71 (46%) remained so even after the cleaning and disinfection operations. In addition, swabs corresponding to 12 of the 937 (1.3%) PEDV-negative swabs taken before cleaning, were detected as PEDV-positive after the cleaning and disinfection procedures, probably owing to different areas being selected in the two samplings. Thus, the cleaning and disinfection procedures succeeded in eliminating the virus in only 54% of the trucks that initially tested PEDV-positive.",

In the postcleaning swabs, all of the samples showed C t values \u226525(Table 1).The analysis performed on the environmental swabs collected from empty trucks arriving at the farms to load animals, revealed that 17 out of 126 samples, corresponding to 14 out of 81 trucks (17.3%), tested PEDV-positive. In particular, PEDV was F I G U R E 3 Percentages of diarrhoeic pigs per age category in 105 herds. Clinical evaluations were performed on 148 breeders, 39 suckling, 46 weaned, and 141 finishers. Diarrhoea was observed in animals of all ages, but greater percentages were observed in the fattening and piglet groups. Breeders, bars with lines; suckling, bars with dots; weaned, black bars; and finishers, grey bars. Percentage ranges of diarrhoeic animals are fixed on the x-axis F I G U R E 4 The Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV)-associated mortality rate per age category in 105 herds. The mortality rate was higher in piglets than in the other categories. Percentage ranges of mortality rates are fixed on the x-axis detected in 13 out of 81 tractors (16%), and four out of 45 trailers (8.9%).",
