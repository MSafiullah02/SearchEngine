            "text": "There are good reasons to suspect that we are not aware of many of the influences that guide the evolution of viruses in nature, and that only a few of the influences can be properly quantified. A rapid review of the major concepts expressed in previous chapters (the chance origin of mutations, multiple selective forces and random events that alter population compositions in an almost incessant manner, potential fidelity modifications of viral polymerases, rapid diversification of viruses even within an individual host, fitness variations due to changes in genomic sequences or in the environment, etc.) forces us to realize that the interpretation of how and why viral populations evolve in nature must be based on largely indirect evidence and a considerable number of assumptions. An understanding of the basic principles that preside over the generation of viral diversity and how some viral forms replace others should be based not only on indirect evidence, but also on the design of experiments in which a limited number of variables can be examined. Ideally, we need to investigate the operation of one variable at a time in an evolutionary outcome, and then try to extend the simplified approach to integrate and interpret the effect of multiple variables acting conjointly.",

            "text": "Some of the concepts explained in previous chapters can indeed be translated into one defined variable. If we ignore intrinsic population heterogeneity, we can compare the effect of viral population size by examining the outcome of an infection of a cell culture or an animal with 0, 1, 10, 102, or 103 infectious units of a virus. We can fix the amount of virus to 102 and examine the influence of prior treatment with 0, 1, 10, 102, or 103 doses of any compound that might modify the virus, the cell, or the virus-cell interaction with the aim of investigating the virus life cycle or finding a new antiviral target. Parallel replicas may help controlling the possible effects of differences in virus population composition. We may also consider physico-chemical variables such as temperature or ionic composition of the cell culture medium. A diagram of some experimental possibilities with viruses that can grow in a cell culture is depicted in Figure 6.1\n. For some virus-cell systems, persistent infections are readily established because the virus displays limited cytopathology. In other cases, persistence is only established from cells that survive killing by the virus (Section 6.4). Remarkable insights have been obtained during the last four decades by subjecting viral populations to defined constraints in the laboratory, inspired by the types of constraints likely to operate in vivo. This is one of the major objectives of experimental evolution in virology. The studies included in this chapter serve the dual purpose of identifying the experimental origin of some of conclusions drawn in other chapters, and of providing additional complementary information on basic concepts of virus evolution.",

            "text": "The transfer of a viral isolate into an alternative host (either a cell culture, an explant, or an intact organism) implies a perturbation regarding the representation of the parental quasispecies in the new host for two reasons: (i) the involvement of a bottleneck event whose intensity depends on the amount of virus in the biological sample relative to the total amount in the infected parental host, and (ii) the change of biological environment from the donor into the recipient host (Figure 6.2\n). Concerning (i), a virus sample contains only a subset of the genomes present in the infected host, and the relative fitness of subsets may not represent the fitness of the entire population, if it were feasible to introduce the entire population into the recipient host. Both chance and selection events will modify the genome composition that will enter subsequent rounds of multiplication (Figure 6.2). This important point was first noted by A. Meyerhans, S. Wain-Hobson, and their colleagues in a comparison of the tat gene from sequential human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, and from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with the natural isolates. The study unveiled the difficulties of defining HIV-1 infections in molecular terms, and the authors coined the following sentence that became popular in virus evolution: \u201cto culture is to disturb\u201d (Meyerhans et al., 1989). It gives a very pertinent image of what is hidden behind quasispecies dynamics.",

            "text": "Important genetic and phenotypic differences between natural isolates and their cell culture-adapted counterparts have been observed in several viruses, including DNA viruses. Polyomaviruses are widespread in humans, but they are rarely pathogenic except for immunocompromised individuals. One of the regions of the polyomavirus genome, the noncoding control region (or NCCR), is quite conserved among natural, usually nonpathogenic isolates. When these viruses are adapted to cell culture, the NCCR undergoes rearrangements involving deletions and duplications. Rearrangements are observed in variants that cause pathology, and they can be readily grown in cell culture. An interesting possibility is that NCCR variants display high replication rates associated with pathogenic potential (Gosert et al., 2010). The connection between replication rate, viral load, and disease progression is discussed in Chapter 8. Genome rearrangements were also identified in regions with repeated sequences in cell culture-adapted cytomegaloviruses (Murphy and Shenk, 2008). These observations with DNA viruses, as well as their relevance for viral persistence and the possible implication of micro-RNA (miRNA) expression have been reviewed (see Imperiale and Jiang, 2015, and references therein). It appears as virtually impossible to maintain a virus population invariant when it enters a different environment.",

            "text": "Studies that rose considerable controversy relate to the elucidation of amino acid substitutions in avian influenza virus (IV) that mediated pathogenicity and human-to-human transmission potential of the virus (reviews in Bouvier and Lowen, 2010, Schrauwen et al., 2014). The ferret is a useful animal model for IV research since it produces respiratory symptoms similar to those in humans. The use of ferret as animal model showed that amino acid substitutions in the receptor-binding domain of the hemagglutinin and the polymerase PB2 were important for transmission of an avian IV among ferrets. In one of the experiments to unveil critical determinants for human-to-human transmission, an avian H9N2 IV was adapted to replication in mammals by serially passaging the avian IV in ferrets. Considerable IV heterogeneity that was diagnostic of active population dynamics in the animals was recorded. The ferret-adapted virus was transmitted efficiently among ferrets, indicating, that, not surprisingly, an avian IV can adapt to be transmissible among humans (Sorrell et al., 2009). Likewise, a number of different mutations, including those that affect receptor preference are needed for effective airborne transmission of an avian H5N1 IV (Herfst et al., 2012). These and other experiments to unveil transmissibility of avian IV in humans open the possibility of next generation sequencing (NGS) screening of avian IVs in search for mutations that may approximate avian viruses to represent a zoonotic threat for humans. The controversy surrounding the need to carry out these types of experiments (\u201cgain of function\u201d experiments) has, in my view, two major components: the uncertainties derived from specifying and publicizing mutations that may render avian IV a biological weapon, and the danger of laboratory escape of a modified IV that can be highly pathogenic and transmissible among humans, causing a devastating disease, in the shadow of the 1918 influenza pandemic. With regard to the first concern, unfortunately, there are many biological weapons available without the need of new ones, and it is very likely that pathogen-enhancing mutations in general (and for IV in particular) do not have a universal value and may change even for closely related isolates of a virus (even, we may speculate, in the course of preparing new stocks for ill-intentioned purposes). Concerning the second concern, indeed, high containment facilities and strict protocols must be used for experiments on directed changes of virus virulence and transmissibility.",

            "text": "A virus that naturally displays a broad host range, and that has contributed examples of biological modifications in vivo is foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). In Chapter 4, a molecular analysis of adaptation of a swine FMDV to the guinea pig was used as an example of the influence of substitutions in nonstructural viral proteins in host range (Section 4.4.1). An earlier analysis of FMDV evolution in vivo involved a collaboration between Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires teams. It consisted in the genetic and antigenic analysis of sequential FMDV samples extracted from cattle during a persistent infection established experimentally with a clonal virus population derived from a cattle isolate (Gebauer et al., 1988). The reason to bring this study here is not only because it is an interesting and informative example of experimental evolution in vivo, but also because its results were published at the time when the extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1 was being discovered. Many virologists regarded variation of HIV-1 as unusual, even unique, perhaps only paralleled by that of IV, with the concept of antigenic shift and drift of IV well established at the time (Chapter 7). H. Temin took the analysis of variation of FMDV reported by F. Gebauer and colleagues to emphasize to his retrovirologist colleagues that HIV-1 was not \u201cunique but merely different\u201d (Temin, 1989). In the study with FMDV, virus was recovered from the esophageal-pharyngeal area, the site of FMDV persistence in ruminants, and the virus was examined for up to 539 days postinfection. Despite the infection originating from a biological clone, the sequential samples displayed genetic heterogeneity and dominance of viral subpopulations. Moreover, the persistent virus evolved at rates as high as 0.9 \u00d7 10\u2212 2 to 7.4 \u00d7 10\u2212 2 substitutions per nucleotide and year (s/nt/y), which is as high or even higher than the rate calculated for HIV-1 [10\u2212 2 to 3.7 \u00d7 10\u2212 4\n s/nt/y according to several studies (Hahn et al., 1986, Korber et al., 2000, Shankarappa et al., 1999)]. The mutations were certainly not neutral since several of them affected the reactivity of the virus with antibodies. This controlled experiment showed that FMDV underwent extensive genetic and antigenic variation during persistence in cattle. Thus, H. Temin could emphasize that HIV-1 is not unique concerning variation potential. If a virus is confronted with a focused selective pressure in vivo\u2014as is the case of FMDV in the pharyngeal region where an active local mucosal immune response is triggered\u2014it can reach remarkable rates of evolution that are 106- to 107-fold higher than average values for cellular genes (Holland et al., 1982) (Chapter 7).",

Gebauer and colleagues with FMDV, persistent viral infections in hosts that display an active immune response (albeit insufficient to clear the virus), may constitute a source of antigenic variants that may occasionally be transmitted to new hosts, or may remain essentially confined to the persistently infected individual. In the latter case, successive waves of variants may be selected to prevent virus clearance by the immune system thus contributing to persistence (Clements et al., 1988, Narayan et al., 1981, Pawlotsky, 2006, Richman et al., 2003, Sponseller et al., 2007, among other examples). Given the potential coevolution of antigenic sites and receptor-recognition domains (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4), persistent infections in animals are a potential threat for the zoonotic emergence of human pathogens, accentuated by the possibility of recombination between the persistent and a related virus from an external source.",

            "text": "The initial findings with bacteriophage Q\u03b2 illustrate how difficult it is for a virus to reach a true population equilibrium. The phage was multiplied for many years in its host Escherichia coli since its isolation from Kyoto feces in 1961 by I. Watanabe and colleagues (Miyake et al., 1967). It was passaged in the laboratories of I. Watanabe, S. Spiegelman (in Urbana), and C. Weissmann (in New York, 1965-1967 and in Z\u00fcrich, 1967-1974). There is no record that the virus had been biologically cloned during these multiple passages in E. coli. In 1974, a clone termed A.S. (from A. Shapira who was working with M. Billeter in Z\u00fcrich) was isolated and its T1 oligonucleotide fingerprint was compared with that of a reconstructed stock of the uncloned Q\u03b2 population. The comparison revealed that the uncloned stock was heterogeneous since one oligonucleotide that was present in full molar amount in clone A.S. was present in submolar amounts in the uncloned stock, and had been replaced by a mutant oligonucleotide (explained in Domingo et al., 1978). The resolved oligonucleotides that represented about 10% of the genome had been sequenced and mapped by M. Billeter, although the results were published years later (Billeter, 1978). These very early comparisons reinforced a suspicion that was frequently commented in the discussions held in Z\u00fcrich: that bacteriophage Q\u03b2, and other RNA bacteriophages, were probably highly heterogeneous [see Weissmann et al. (1973) for statements about potential heterogeneity at the time that nucleotide sequencing was slow and cumbersome]. Earlier indirect evidence of genetic instability of RNA viruses (abundance of temperature sensitive mutants in virus stocks, frequent reversion of phenotypic markers, etc.) was reviewed (Domingo and Holland, 1988). The observations with bacteriophage Q\u03b2 prompted the discovery of viral quasispecies (as described in Chapter 3), but the reason to bring them here is to emphasize that even after extensive passage without cloning, no population equilibrium with one dominant genome type was reached in the Q\u03b2 population.",

Nonequilibrium might have been favored by the mutual effects (positive or negative, sometimes termed epistatic effects) among mutations in the same genome, and interactions among different genomes, or sampling effects during passages among other factors. It is worth (albeit not easy) picturing that a tendency toward equilibrium (meaning a trend toward a steady distribution of mutant forms) has to be based on the number and types of mutants available to the viral population at a given time. When new mutants are generated stochastically, the pathway toward equilibrium may change. A very large population will generate a larger number of alternatives toward equilibrium to choose from, as compared to a small population. This is why deterministic features of quasispecies are more likely to be observed with large viral populations (Section 3.6.2 in Chapter 3). No equilibrium can be assumed (and much less so the absence of mutations!) even for a virus with a long history of multiplication in the same environment (Box 6.1\n).Box 6.1Some Teachings of Experimental Virus Evolution\n\u2022Mutant viruses are continuously arising in viral populations. Even prolonged passage in the same environment does not mean that a population equilibrium has been attained. An invariant consensus sequence does not imply absence of mutations. It means that the genomes are mutating continuously to yield the same consensus.\u2022Virus evolution consists in the replacement of some viral subpopulation by others, due to random events or in response to selective constraints.\u2022The reorganization of viral subpopulations is profoundly altered by bottleneck events.\u2022The model studies predict that the effect of a bottleneck depends on its size and the fitness of the parental population.\u2022Work conducted under the guidance of J.J.

Because conditions are far from population equilibrium, such replacements occur even in the absence of an externally applied selective pressure. A selective pressure acts as a guiding force to decant viral subpopulations in favor of those that best respond to the constraint, often after many transient, abortive attempts, as also observed in natural infections (Cale et al., 2011, Fischer et al., 2010, Kortenhoeven et al., 2015, Tsibris et al., 2009) (Figure 6.3\n).

The main conclusion with two new persistent BHK-21-FMDV lineages established in parallel was that the virus-cell coevolution displayed features very similar to those observed in the first persistent lineage, although there were differences in some of the mutations in FMDV. However, two amino acid substitutions which affected residues around a pore located at the capsid 5-fold axis were selected in the three persistent lineages. One of the substitutions (D9 \u2192 A in capsid protein VP3) was later selected in other FMDV serotypes that having originated in acute infections in animals, were passaged in evolved BHK-21 cells that displayed partial resistance to the virus (de la Torre et al., 1988, D\u00edez et al., 1990, Escarmis et al., 1998). This substitution belongs to the category of \u201cjoker\u201d substitutions in the sense of providing a selective advantage to the virus in a variety of sequence contexts and environments (Section 4.9 in Chapter 4).",

            "text": "The two newly established BHK-21-FMDV persistent lineages displayed strikingly parallel features in the variation of progeny production and imbalances in the ratio of positive versus negative strand viral RNA, that were found at the same passage number (Herrera et al., 2008). This parallel behavior reflects a deterministic feature of virus evolution, that has been encountered with other virus-host systems (see Section 6.7.1 and the general concept of deterministic vs. stochastic quasispecies in Section 3.6.2 of Chapter 3). Interestingly, a deterministic behavior should be generally favored by large viral population sizes, but in this case a drastic decrease in population size preceded its manifestation. This unexpected association was interpreted as deterministic behavior being due to strict selective demands that guide the virus toward one (or very few) biological solutions to respond to the constraint (Herrera et al., 2008). The reproducibility of the main features of FMDV persistence in independent establishment events was suggested to mean that when a biological system is highly constrained, there may be limited room for contingency. Thus, we can now consider the question: If we could rewind the tape of evolution and play it again, would it turn out to be similar or different from what we know? According to S.J. Gould if we could rewind the tape to the remote past, evolution would turn out entirely different (Gould, 1989). The answer proposed by M. Herrera and colleagues was that the tape would turn out equally, differently or \u201cin between\u201d depending on the constraints operating at the time we start to retape. If the tape was situated in the RNA world around 3.6 \u00d7 109 to 4.2 \u00d7 109 years ago or perhaps prior to the Cambrian explosion, about 5 \u00d7 108 years ago (Conway Morris, 1998, Gould, 1989) there would be ample room for divergence due to equally valid alternative solutions. In contrast, once the constraints inherent to functional cells and viruses are in place, the system should be forced to a seemingly deterministic behavior (see Chapter 1 for the time frame in which the increasingly chemical and precellular complexity evolved on Earth).",

What the experiments of viral persistence in cell culture show is that as part of coevolutionary mechanisms, a cell may diminish the expression of surface proteins that act as receptors for the coevolving virus or even alter fundamental properties such as the rate of cellular multiplication. Cells persistently infected with PV express mutated forms of the PV receptor CD155 (Gosselin et al., 2003, Pavio et al., 2000), and persistently infected BHK-21 cells increased their degree of cellular transformation (de la Torre et al., 1988, de la Torre et al., 1989b). [As review of picornavirus persistence, see Colb\u00e8re-Garapin and Lipton (2010).] It has been proposed that in the primitive biosphere early vesicles evolved to limit their invasion by virus-like elements, and they did so by building protective walls that culminated in primitive receptor-dependent virus entry into increasingly autonomous precellular entities. The insights provided by current cell-virus coevolution models indicate that such kind of mutual influences occur with naked or enveloped viruses without the need for the virus to integrate its genome (or part of it) into the genetic material of the coevolving cell (Colb\u00e8re-Garapin and Lipton, 2010, de la Torre et al., 1988). During persistent infectious in cell culture, virus titers change in ways partially dictated by their own quasispecies dynamics and coevolving carrier cells.",

Muller, known as Muller's ratchet (Maynard-Smith, 1976, Muller, 1964, Nowak and Schuster, 1989). The proposal is that small populations of asexual organisms that display high mutation rates will tend to incorporate mutations (the majority deleterious) in an irreversible, ratchet-type mechanism, unless recombination can yield the initial type of genome devoid of mutations (often termed the zero mutation class of genomes). Fitness decrease due to accumulation of mutations proposed by H.J. Muller in general terms is expected to be accentuated in the case of viral populations with continuous generation of new mutant genomes. In mutant spectra of viruses the least mutated class of genomes will be the one displaying highest replicative fitness and will correspond to the master sequence that dominates the population (Chapter 3). With the plaque-to-plaque transfer design there is a probability that in each plating (a step or click in the ratchet) the least mutated class of genomes is lost. Therefore, the viral population is forced to regenerate a distribution from which again the least mutated class will be lost in the next ratchet click. The system is doomed to rapid deterioration and extinction, unless mechanisms to restore fitter genomes operate.",

Avoidance of the detrimental effects of Muller's ratchet is believed to have been one of the driving forces to introduce genetic recombination and sex in the reproduction and evolution of living systems (Agrawal, 2006, Barton and Charlesworth, 1998, Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry, 1999, Maynard-Smith, 1976). In the words of G. Bell: \u201cSex acts as an editor which detects serious copying errors and enables the genetic message to be transmitted without contamination\u201d (Bell, 1988). It is worth comparing this sentence by G. Bell with the molecular evidence discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 that copying errors during virus replication are not corrected because of the absence of proofreading exonucleases (or related) activities in RNA viruses. Lack of correcting activities is remarkable from the point of view of an evolution rich in lateral gene transfers because proofreading-repair activities are available not only from DNA polymerases but also from the coronavirus polymerases (and likely other large RNA genomes to be discovered). This raises the issue of clonal evolution in viruses, an important feature of long-term virus evolution (Chapter 10). Now we return to plaque-to-plaque transfers because there is more to learn from them.",

Many mutations that had never been found in natural isolates or laboratory clones and populations of FMDV were found. A total of 69 mutations affecting the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), L-protease, P1- and polymerase-coding regions were identified (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1996). Notably, 9 out of 19 clones showed an extension of an internal tract of four adenylate residues that precedes the second functional AUG. Depending on the clone, the extension was of one, or several residues and up to 23 additional adenylates in one of the clones. This elongation affected translation, was one of the determinants of fitness decrease, and reverted when the clones were subjected to large population passages. It was proposed that the elongation, that constitutes a hot spot for variation, was prompted by slippage mutagenesis of the polymerase. This genetic lesion in the FMDV genome was given as an example of mutational instruction in Section 2.3 of Chapter 2, and it served as one of the genetic markers for quasispecies memory when it reverted upon large population passages of the altered clones (Section 5.5 in Chapter 5). The molecular instability associated with this oligoadenylate elongation is illustrated by the fact that genomes with different numbers of adenylate residues coexisted in the same viral plaque.",

The most salient phenotypic change is that after more than 100 transfers the virus became noncytolytic, was unable to form visible plaques, and it could readily establish a persistent, noncytocidal infection that normally would be established only from the few cells that survived a cytolytic infection (see Section 6.4). Thus, strikingly, a fundamental property of the virus-host interaction such as the capacity to kill cells [a very marker of virus virulence! (see Section 5.6 in Chapter 5)], was totally altered as a result of repeated bottleneck passages. In fact, if infectivity is judged by the capacity to produce plaques, these multiply transferred clones underwent decreases of specific infectivity (the ratio between the amount of infectivity and that of viral RNA) of at least 140-fold relative to their corresponding parental biological clone. Such a reduction is enormous, and it should serve to compare the decrease of specific infectivity that accompanies virus extinction by lethal mutagenesis. (Decreases of specific infectivity is mentioned in Section 4.3 of Chapter 4 as one of the consequences of suboptimal codon usage, and are revisited in Chapter 9 as a diagnostic parameter of lethal mutagenesis.) A proof that pursuing molecular analysis of clones subjected to many bottleneck transfers may provide new information was documented by the discovery of an amino acid substitution in capsid protein VP1 that produced virus thermosensitivity, and exerted an effect at a distance in the processing of the FMDV polyprotein (Escarm\u00eds et al., 2009), unveiling a new feature of picornavirus protein processing (Mart\u00ednez-Salas and Ryan, 2010).

            "text": "Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why so many unusual, often unique, detrimental mutations can be rescued in clones subjected to many plaque transfers. One model emphasizes that negative selection is attenuated during plaque transfers in the sense that no truly competitive optimization of the mutant spectrum is allowed, except for intracellular competition in each individual cell. The competitive mixing of genomes is limited in the cell monolayer whose individual cells become infected by the wave of progeny virus that had its initial focus in the cell hit by the virus in the corresponding transfer. Even accepting that intraplaque MOI might be high, no competition among many of the newly arising genomes can take place in any of the cells. Therefore, the displacement of unfit genomes by fitter ones is limited. A necessity to explain the frequency and types of mutations observed is that the virus must be subjected to high mutational pressure. Although mutation rates for RNA viruses are discussed in Chapter 2, it must be stated here that many of the studies that allowed a quantification of high mutation rates came from experimental evolution designs. The fact that one of the clones at transfer 409 differed from its parental clone in 122 mutations, implies a mutation frequency of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u2212 2\n s/nt (Escarm\u00eds et al. 2008). Remarkably when FMDV is subjected to mutagenesis, a tenfold lower frequency can drive the virus to extinction (Chapter 9). The observed mutability during plaque transfers renders perfectly understandable multiple reversion events scored in picornavirus genomes (de la Torre et al., 1992, Domingo et al., 2010).",

Several experimental studies of experimental evolution and theoretical predictions support that either increases or decreases of fitness reach a plateau, proposed to be the result of mutational effects and the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations (average mutations will increase fitness of a very low-fitness population but decrease fitness of a high-fitness population) (Silander et al., 2007).",

The results reinforce the concept of extreme resistance of viruses to extinction at the population level despite many extinctions at the individual level. The reason is that when fitness is very low the probability of stochastic occurrence of beneficial mutations can rescue subpopulations from their fate toward extinction (Escarm\u00eds et al., 2002).",

In the course of hundreds of passages, the virus diversified in two distinct subpopulations that exhibited a competition-colonization dynamics previously shown by D. Tilman to operate in classical ecological systems (Tilman, 1994). The viruses diversified into colonizers which were efficient in killing cells, and competitors that modulated cell killing. Thus, internal quasispecies interactions modulated virus virulence (Ojosnegros et al., 2010). This balance was maintained until around passage 260 at which the viral genome became segmented: the monopartite genome was converted into two segments that complemented each other to replicate and kill cells (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004, Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2006, Moreno et al., 2014, Ojosnegros et al., 2011).

In parallel competitions of a wild-type VSV and a surrogate marked subclone of equal fitness, a predictable nonlinear behavior of the two populations was characterized (Quer et al., 1996). After nearly constant times, the two viruses competing in a constant cell culture environment followed different trajectories. There was a reproducible tendency of the wild type to gain fitness at a higher rate than the surrogate mutant. Thus, despite the stochastic occurrence of mutations, a nearly deterministic evolutionary behavior was observed (Tsimring et al., 1996). A number of environmental perturbations (presence of DIs, increased temperature during viral replication, or limited, enhanced mutagenesis) led to an accelerated dominance of the wild type over the mutant (Quer et al., 2001). Comparison of consensus nucleotide sequences of the entire VSV genomes showed that the mutant genome had a number of mutations with respect to the wild type, and suggested that neutrality of the mutant relative to the wild type was maintained provided the environment was not perturbed. The behavior of the mutant relative to the wild type was described as being of \u201ccontingent neutrality.\u201d The presence of mutations rendered the virus less robust to accept additional mutations. In terms of fitness landscapes, the results can be interpreted as if that the wild type lies on a relatively flat (or less rugged) fitness surface that preserves its replicative efficacy despite occurrence of mutations. In contrast, the mutant lies on a sharper fitness peak prone to fitness decreases upon mutation or environmental stress (Sections 5.3 and 5.7 in Chapter 5).",

The mutants were added to the mutant spectrum of a biological clone of FMDV, at a concentration typical of the antibody-resistant mutants found in FMDV. The reconstructed quasispecies was allowed to replicate in the absence and presence of the MAb, and the resulting populations analyzed. In the populations passaged in the presence of the antibody, but not in the control population, 10 out of the 19 mutant introduced became dominant, indicating selection of a mutant cloud that shared the required phenotype (Perales et al., 2005). In a subsequent study, the FMDV quasispecies was reconstructed with matched pairs of distinguishable MAb-escape mutants of the same antigenic site. Each mutant of a pair differed from the other in 11- or 33-fold in fitness. The analysis of the populations subjected to antibody selection revealed dominance of the corresponding high-fitness mutants. Thus, relative viral fitness can influence significantly the mutant repertoire selected by neutralizing antibody (Martin et al., 2006). Such fitness effects are likely to underlie the response to any selective constraint, and should be considered in the interpretation of the effect of selective forces acting on complex viral populations.",

A reexamination of the recent evidence derived from application of NGS to in vivo systems renders the suggestion of a fundamental difference between cell culture and in vivo quasispecies dynamics untenable. One can argue that in vivo systems offer highly complex, compartmentalized environment that delays a possible approach to population equilibrium, as compared with a uniform and constant environment. What we have learnt, however, from the several model experimental studies summarized in this chapter, both using cell culture systems and animals, is that there are no fundamental differences in the quasispecies behavior of viruses in cell culture and in vivo. Perhaps a significant example is provided by the accumulation of mutations in the FMDV genomes and the profound phenotypic changes observed both in cell culture plaque-to-plaque transfers and in serial bottleneck transmission of the virus in swine (Section 6.5.2). Evidence in support of the value of quasispecies to interpret viral population dynamics in vivo is increasing as the new tools of NGS are applied to evolving viral population.",

The potential implications for the diagnosis of viral disease and considerations for treatment options are very evident, and they will be discussed in coming chapters (see Summary Box).Summary Box\n\u2022Experimental evolution permits the establishment of many fundamental concepts of virus evolution that are facilitating the interpretation of observations in the far more complex natural scenarios.\u2022Designs intended to reproduce extreme passage regimes have unveiled many features of mutant spectra that are hidden to standard analyses based exclusively on consensus sequences. In particular, multiple plaque-to-plaque transfers have revealed that extremely unusual mutations can be found in low-fitness viruses that result in extreme phenotypes. Such unusual viral subpopulations replicate thanks to the presence of compensatory mutations that rescue a few genomes out of a great majority that are extinguished.\u2022The experimental studies have revealed the fitness dependence of fitness variation, a field of research still to be applied in vivo. Fitness increases and decreases have a limit imposed either by an insufficient population size or by extremely low replicative fitness. In such extreme scenarios, unexpected evolutionary transitions may be favored.\u2022Several concepts of population genetics have found experimental support in work with viruses, notably Muller's ratchet, Competitive Exclusion principle, and the Red Queen hypothesis.\u2022The dynamics of competition between viral populations has defined the concept of contingent neutrality in virus evolution.\u2022The capacity to reconstruct quasispecies with selected types of mutants opens new research avenues to understand viral population dynamics under controlled conditions.\u2022It will be extremely interesting to reexamine the population dynamics in the different designs described in this chapter with the new tool of next generation sequencing.\n\n",

If the same subset is subjected to plaque-to-plaque transfers, mutations accumulate beginning with a founder genome that will hitchhike two initial mutations (red triangle and horizontal line). In the middle branch B the three biological clones will have different initial mutations, and heterogeneity will increase upon expansion of the population. In the bottom branch C, adaptation to a new host will imply increasing dominance of new mutations (yellow and blue asterisks).
