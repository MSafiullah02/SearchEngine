The main anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is to inhibit a large number of pro-inflammatory genes that encode cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes, and receptors to address the inflammatory process and restore homeostasis.9 However, the results of clinical studies on the role of corticosteroids remain controversial. A retrospective study showed that the vast majority of SARS patients received satisfactory results from the use of corticosteroids.10 But in a retrospective observational study of MERS patients, the result showed that patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy.11 Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to identify the roles of corticosteroids in patients with coronavirus.",

In clinic, corticosteroids are widely used in symptomatic treatment of severe pneumonia. However, there has been considerable controversy as to whether COVID-19 patients should be treated with corticosteroids. Russell and colleagues recommend that corticosteroids should not be used in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial.25 But a team of front-line physicians from China had a different perspective, they recommended short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose, used prudently, for critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.26 So it is very important to provide evidence for corticosteroid treatment of in patients with coronavirus.",

The similar results were also observed in the subgroup of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients with SARS-CoV infection. A study showed that the concentrations of cytokines (such as interleukin 7 [IL7], IL8, IL9, IL10 and so on) in serum in the COVID-19 patients were higher than in healthy adults. In addition, cytokines (such as IL2, IL7, IL10 and so on) concentrations in intensive care unit (ICU) patients were higher than non-ICU patients. These revealed that patients with COVID-19 were usually accompanied by increased immune factors and inflammatory responses, and the concentrations of immune factors were associated with the severity of the disease.5 Further autopsy revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with fibrous mucinous exudate and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration dominated by lymphocytes, which were very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.27 As we all known, corticosteroids do not directly inhibit virus replication, their main role is anti-inflammatory and suppress immune response.28 In the early stage of inflammation, glucocorticoids reduce capillary dilation, inflammatory cell exudation, leukocyte infiltration, and phagocytosis. In the late stage, glucocorticoids can inhibit the excessive proliferation of capillaries and fibroblasts. Furthermore, by binding to their receptors, glucocorticoids inhibit nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling and further inhibit the transcription and translation of inflammatory factors.9 These explained why corticosteroids therapy was more needed in severely ill patients with coronavirus infection.",

There might be multiple mechanisms that contributed to these outcomes. There is a study shows that glucocorticoids inhibit the production of IL-2 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in T lymphocytes, shift T cell responses from the Th1 to the Th2 type, induce programmed cell death in a variety of different immunologically relevant cells, including immature T and B cell precursors and mature T cells.29 Another study find that preexisting CD4+ T cells are associated with lower viral shedding and less severe disease.30 There is evidence that the use of corticosteroids may lead to prolonged removal of viral RNA from the airways,11 blood,31 and feces of patients,32 resulting in longer hospital stays, and ultimately increasing the risk of mortality. In addition, our analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were more likely to develop bacterial infection due to immunosuppression. This could make the disease worse and lead to death. We also performed subgroup analysis, the result indicated that the mortality of neither SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV was associated with corticosteroids therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with mortality when we excluded a study.14 Therefore, we need to treat this result with caution.",
