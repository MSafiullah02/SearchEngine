Its genome consists of an approximately 5,200 nucleotide (nt) DNA molecule containing two large open reading frames (ORFs), encoding two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and two structural (VP1 and VP2) proteins, generated through alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2012; Reed, Jones, & Miller, 1988).",

CPV\u20102 emerged as dog pathogen in the late 1970s, most likely as host variant of feline parvovirus (FPV) or a related strain (Truyen, 2006), displaying an intrinsic high rate of nucleotide changes (Decaro et al., 2009; Pereira, Leal, & Durigon, 2007; Shackelton, Parrish, Truyen, & Holmes, 2005). After its emergence, the original type CPV\u20102 was replaced by three antigenic variants termed CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b and CPV\u20102c (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Parrish et al., 1991; Parrish, O\u2019Connell, Evermann, & Carmichael, 1985).

In the last decades, several studies analysed the spread of CPV strains in Italy, and in 2001, the emergence of the CPV\u20102c variant was firstly reported (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). In the following years, all three CPV variants were described in Italy, with a slightly higher prevalence of the CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102c variants (Decaro, Desario, et al., 2007; Decaro et al., 2013, 2006; Tucciarone et al., 2018). More recently, a CPV\u20102c strain displaying genetic signatures typical of Asian viruses was detected in southern Italy (Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018), thus suggesting the introduction of the virus from other countries, as reported for other canine viruses (Decaro, Campolo, et al., 2007; Martella et al., 2006; Mira, Purpari, Bella, et al., 2018). Therefore, a continuous molecular survey was assessed to point out eventual introduction and spread of CPV strains originated from other geographic areas in the Italian canine population.",

Despite the close genetic relationship with the previous Asian CPV\u20102c strain reported in Italy, its absence in the following months suggests a second introduction of Asian CPV\u20102c strains. Alternatively, the silent circulation of the original Asian strain in the field with accumulation of few point mutation should be hypothesized. The evidence in rescued stray dogs and in dogs without anamnesis of previous movements, as well as the different dates and places of collection, suggested the active spread of these strains in the field. It remains unclear how these strains have been introduced in Italy, if directly through infected animals or indirectly due to the extreme stability of the CPV in the environment (Hoelzer & Parrish, 2010). According to this study, the spread of Asian CPV strains in a separate geographical area different from Asian countries could be suggested, as previously described in South America (Grecco et al., 2018; Maya et al., 2013).",

Indeed, the Asian CPV\u20102c variant shows specific amino acids in NS1 (60V, 544F, 545V, 630P) and VP2 (5A/G, 267Y, 297A, 324I, 370R) gene sequences. Most of these amino acids have been described in the VP2 of CPV\u20102a/2b/2c strains collected in China, Vietnam, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan (Chiang et al., 2016; Geng et al., 2015; Han et al., 2015; Jeoung et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2014; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2004; Phromnoi, Sirinarumitr, & Sirinarumitr, 2010; Soma, Taharaguchi, Ohinata, Ishii, & Hara, 2013; Xu et al., 2015; Yi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010). In particular, CPV\u20102c strains displaying the amino acid glycine (G) instead of the highly conserved alanine (A) at residue 5 of the VP2 have been previously detected in China (Wang et al., 2016) and Italy (Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018). More recently, molecular analyses including the NS1 gene sequence showed the presence of molecular signatures of the Asian CPV strains even in this region (Han et al., 2015; Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2019).

As observed also in this study, phylogeny lacks any clustering based on the single VP2 aa residue 426 (CPV\u20102a/2b/2c), as well as on the geographic origin and period of sample collection. Therefore, a wider evolutionary analysis further supports the thesis to consider the CPV antigenic variants as variants of CPV\u20102a rather than distinct subtypes (Organtini, Allison, Lukk, Parrish, & Hafenstein, 2015) and could be considered as a more reliable tool in outbreak tracing.",
