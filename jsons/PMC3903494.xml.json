Disinfection research in virology is somewhat neglected, although prevalence studies and personnel monitoring have shown contamination hazards [25]. The useful dilutions and contact time of virucidal surface disinfectants are still based on concentrations that will pass either an European suspension test, that is, EN 14476, or a national standard, such as the German DVV/RKI suspension test [11], [18]. In order to improve time/concentration relations of surface disinfectants which reflect dayly needs in clinical surroundings further more practical testing is necessary. Therefore, a virucidal quantitative carrier test that simulates practical conditions was evaluated in this study. The method was based on the EN 13697 standard for the following reasons [14], [20]: In 1993, experts from the veterinary, food, industrial, domestic and institutional fields within the framework of CEN/TC 216 developed such a quantitative surface test for bactericidal and fungicidal products that mimics real conditions [26]. Derived from this work is the European standard EN 13697 [14], a quantitative non-porous surface test for the evaluation of the bactericidal and/or fungicidal activity of chemical disinfectants without mechanical action (phase 2, step 2). Ring trials during the 1990s demonstrated that this surface test, when using dried bacteria or fungi on stainless steel carriers, could result in 10-fold lower reduction factors than those obtained using suspension tests [13]. This observations are also supported by studies of Peters and Spicher on Staphylococcus aureus which showed an increased resistance to formaldehyde, from 0.8% in the suspension test to 1.2% in the surface test [27], [28]. Based on this observatiuons, it is assumed that virucidal disinfectants might also show an increased resistance in the surface test. However, a virucidal surface test is required to substantiate this notion and for further knowledge.",

Currently, poliovirus and AdV-5 are used by the European Standard EN 14476 as model viruses for quantitative suspension tests [11]. Poliovirus was excluded from this study because it is relatively sensitive to the drying process, with a loss of titer of approximately 3 log10\n[17]. In addition, due to the WHO polio eradication program, poliovirus will need to be substituted with another model virus with similar properties in the future. The thermoresistant virus BPV is used for the determination of the virucidal activity of chemothermal disinfection procedures in both the EN 14476 and the DVV/RKI guideline. However, BPV is difficult to grow in the laboratory. In contrast, PPV and MVM are easy to propagate. Therefore, this study investigated the suitability of AdV-5 and four different animal parvoviruses (BPV, CPV, MVM, and PPV) as putative model viruses that can potentially substitute for poliovirus.",

Furthermore, due to the clinical impact of human noroviruses, we recommend the additional use of murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate virus for human noroviruses, in combination with AdV-5 and MVM for future guidelines or standards that evaluate the virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants. In the revised version of prEN 14476:2013, MNV is included as a test virus. In the food and industrial sectors, multiple studies evaluating norovirus inactivation on surfaces have been recently performed [21], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Some studies were carried out using MNV on stainless steel carriers [21], [35]. Magulski et al. [21] tested the inactivating properties of several chemical biocides using MNV. MNV demonstrated a similar stability during drying as AdV-5 and parvoviruses. The virucidal susceptibility of MNV is similar to those of PPV in our study [21]. Concentrations of 1500 ppm for PAA and 2500 ppm for GDA were needed to inactivate 99.99% of MNV within 5 min [21]. However, the activity range of alcohols was nearly the same as for AdV-5 in our study. Ethanol (50%, v/v) and 1-propanol (30%, v/v) could inactivate MNV-1 on stainless steel discs by 4 log10 units within 5 min, and 2-propanol was not active. As already mentioned, one of the aims of our study was to evaluate the reproducibility of the method used. We could show, that there were no considerable intra- and inter-laboratory log10 RF differences discerned for the PVs. The observed log10 RF discrepancies were found at concentrations with low efficacy and might be caused by a number of factors (e.g., the manner of the preparation of the test virus suspension, limitations due to cytotoxic reactions, inactivation kinetics). Our study has some limitations that are based on the nature of virus cultivation. For example, if all labs used viruses and cells from the same origin at an identical passage number and equal culture media, as well as under other identical conditions, the results would perhaps differ to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the performance of our study includes the biological variety that appears during disinfectant testing. High standardization for virus cultivation and reproducible measures to minimize cytotoxicity are necessary for performing this method. Further standardization of this method might be achieved by the introduction of certain reference biocides with defined reference ranges, such as GDA, PAA, or ethanol. This and further ring trials will contribute to improving the comparability of virucidal tests between laboratories.",
