[1] Few studies established direct correlation between concentrations of LDH and acute-phase cytokines. LDH is a reliable biomarker of acute inflammatory injury associated with upper respiratory infections (URI). Unlike LDH, these cytokines in themselves do not directly represent cellular injury -the acute-phase cytokines are the mediators of inflammation, whereas LDH is the product of inflammatory injury. [2] LDH is enzyme released in the bronchoalveolar space on damage of cytoplasmic cell membrane. Elevated LDH is also indicator of underlying lung injury and inflammation. [3] Serum LDH elevation had direct links to prognosis in this outbreak as well. Cohort of 138 cases of COVID-19 reported LDH elevation in 38% which had 4% mortality [7] whereas cohort of 99 cases reported having LDH elevation in 75% which had 11% mortality. Elevated LDH in the previous studies also was reported to be associated with bad prognosis as was seen in 2003 outbreak. [4] NASOPHARYNGEAL LDH, VIRAL URI, AND COVID-19",

Now coming to viral URI and elevated LDH, in a study done on pediatric cases, elevated LDH in nasopharyngeal sample was associated with increased chances of acute otitis media (AOM). LDH was indicator of nasopharyngeal injury and inflammation, leading to Eustachian tube damage which resulted in AOM.

[12] Furthermore, viral URI causes more rise in LDH as compared to bacterial. [13] Based on the study done by Ede Lin, 2013, [2] nasopharyngeal LDH and its association with various viruses are mentioned in Table 1 . [2] If we study this Table 1 carefully then, you can find that the mean LDH and median LDH concentration in mU/ml was higher in coronavirus patients, we agree that the study population was small and hence is limitation but still given the severity of COVID-19, it is bound to have raised LDH at presentation.",
