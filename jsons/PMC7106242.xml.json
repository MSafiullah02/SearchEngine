Beijing, the region most affected by the epidemic, reported 2521 cases and 191 deaths [2]. Shortly after the description of this new viral disease, a novel infectious coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as its pathogenic agent. Clinical observation has revealed that hematological changes in peripheral blood and acute lung injury are the major clinical characteristics of SARS. A marked lymphocytopenia occurred in most patients during the acute phase of SARS, with CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets particularly affected, and the degree of reduction of circulating T lymphocyte counts was found to be associated with disease severity, indicating that host immune functional changes are involved in the initiation and progression of SARS [3], [4], [5], [6]. Although acute lung injury and hematological manifestations have been observed in patients with SARS, the mechanisms underlying for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection are not yet understood.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) have been demonstrated to function in orchestrating the immune response against invading pathogens including bacteria, parasites, and viruses [7], [8], [9]. Although DCs include multiple subsets, human peripheral blood DCs can be principally grouped into at least two distinct subsets, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), on the base of their lineages and phenotypic and functional differences [8]. In general, human mDCs are well-equipped to induce Th1 polarization via production of interleukin (IL)-12 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 when properly stimulated. pDCs are characterized by their distinct capacity to produce large amounts of type I IFN in response to virus [10], [11]. However, the functions of each DC subset are flexible in vivo and vary according to their state of activation and the nature of the maturation stimuli given to DCs [12]. Recent clinical studies by our and other laboratories have demonstrated numerical decrease and functional impairment of both mDC and pDC subsets in blood of patients with chronic viral infections, resembling those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13], [14], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [15], and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [16], [17]. Moreover, pDC counts decrease in parallel with the progression of HIV-related disorders [14]. Currently, whether DCs participate in SARS is still unclear, since there is a paucity of clinical data concerning DCs in patients with this condition [18].",

Steroid treatment is believed to play an immunosuppressive role and to confer clinical benefits in the treatment of SARS, though randomized clinical trials to support its clinical efficacy are not available. To investigate the role of DCs in the immune pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and the effect of steroids on DCs in SARS patients, we serially examined circulating mDC and pDC subsets, as well as CD4 and CD8 T cells in 74 SARS patients who received steroid treatment. In addition, we screened the expression of SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both peripheral DC and lymphocyte populations, and examined associations between DC number and specific antibody generation.",

Peripheral mDCs, pDCs, CD4, and CD8 T-cell numbers were monitored weekly for each individual.

As shown in Fig. 4\n, steroid administration was inversely correlated with absolute numbers of both circulating DC and T-cell subsets. In general, patients in the group receiving higher doses of steroid had lower numbers of circulating mDCs, pDCs, CD4, and CD8 T cells and slower restoration of cell numbers to normal levels than patients in the group receiving lower doses of steroid. A significant inverse correlation between steroid dosage and numbers of cells in DC subsets was observed from week 2 after the onset of illness. This correlation was sustained throughout the course of steroid administration for the subjects examined. By contrast, though a significant inverse correlation was also observed between steroid dosage and numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells, the duration of decrease in numbers of cells in T-cell subsets was shorter.

Patients were assigned into the DC-high group if the numbers of both mDCs and pDCs, at least, reached higher than the mean value of the healthy controls during this period. Otherwise, patients were assigned into the DC-low group. In this way, both groups had similar DC counts over the initial 4 weeks of illness, but the DC-high group had an earlier increase and full restoration of DC numbers (Figs. 5A and B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the DC-high group had a better IgG anti-SARS-CoV antibody response than the DC-low group, suggesting that persistence of reduction of both mDC and pDC subsets might have affected the generation of the specific antibody in SARS-CoV infection, as previously speculated [7], [25].",

Patient 1 (51 years old, male) and patient 2 (73 years old, male) exhibited extreme decrease in circulating numbers of the DC and T-cell subsets throughout high-dose steroid treatment.

In our study, longitudinal observation demonstrated for the first time a rapid, dramatic decline and sustained period of low levels of peripheral subsets of both mDCs and pDCs. We simultaneously observed a significant but reversible decrease in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations, consistent with previous reports [4], [5].

Our findings showed that peak reduction of DC subsets often occurred around the 12th\u201315th day of disease and partly overlapped with the lung damage phase.

However, it is still unclear how the human immune system is impaired in SARS infection. Our findings showed amounts of DCs and T cells were inversely correlated with intensity of high-dose steroid treatment in SARS patients (Fig. 4, Fig. 6), though our data should be interpreted with caution (see below). Notably, the DC subsets in blood exhibited significant delay in restoration to normal number compared with clinical recovery and resolution of pulmonary damage in our study. In addition, our findings suggest that lower counts of mDC and pDC subsets may be associated with poor prognosis in some patients, as in a previous study of low CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts [27]. It is likely that use of steroid at high doses (\u2265160 mg/day) over 2\u20133 weeks further exacerbated and prolonged the decrease in numbers of pDCs and mDCs in SARS patients. Therefore, long-term use of high-dose steroid therapy is potentially risky, especially for SARS patients in critical status who have other conditions like diabetes and heart disease. Compared with the mDCs and T-cell subsets, pDCs exhibited a greater decrease and slower restoration of number, suggesting at a minimum that circulating pDCs are likely to be more sensitive to steroid administration, as described by Shodell et al. [29], [30]. In addition to direct effects of SARS-CoV infection, the following mechanisms may have accounted for the reduction of circulating mDCs, pDCs, and T-cell subsets in SARS patients: (1) Steroid treatment may induce apoptosis of activated T cells [31] and T-lymphocyte movement out of the intravascular compartment [32]. In particular, the decrease of DC subsets might have been caused by preferential trafficking and recruitment of these cells into the pathologically pulmonary tissue sites from naturally circulating blood as reported in tuberculosis [33]. (2) Glucocorticoids may suppress differentiation and maturation of DC subsets, induce their apoptosis and tissue sequestration singly or together [34], [35], [36], [37].",

            "text": "Some viruses may directly infect immunocytes and cause impairment of the cell populations, as occurs in HCV infection [38]. However, it is still unclear how SARS-CoV impairs the human immune system in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV replication was observed in PBMC [39], and mDCs are able to interact with S protein and to bind virus [40]. Even though ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV [41], our findings further demonstrated lack of ACE2 expression on human DC subsets and T lymphocytes, consistent with previous findings [42]. It is thus unlikely that the decreases in numbers of circulating DC and T-cell subsets in vivo are due to direct injury by SARS-CoV infection of these cells through ACE2 molecules. In addressing this issue, some investigators have recently reported that SARS-CoV may infect macrophages through cellular phagocytosis, and enter mDCs through viral binding to surface DC-SIGN receptors [43] or other unclear mechanisms since DCs rarely express DC-SIGN in vivo [44]. Recent studies have shown that viral infection usually induces the production of large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 by pDCs, as a host defense against virus [14], [45]. However, we found a significantly lower level of plasma IFN-\u03b1 (161.09 \u00b1 132.69 pg/ml) in 85.7% patients in the acute phase of SARS illness than in healthy controls (867.18 \u00b1 306.50 pg/ml) [46]. This finding accords with the observed reduction of pDC number, but the precise relationship between these remains to be clarified.",
