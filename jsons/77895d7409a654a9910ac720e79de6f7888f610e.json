However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6 th to 15 th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests.",

The key community-based measures include self-isolation, hand-washing with soap, restriction of movements with lock down measures, sanitization of surfaces. Facility-based measures have so far included use of personal protective equipment before handling patients, testing of symptomatic patients, treatment and contact tracing, in addition to quarantine of the suspected and diagnosed cases [8]; [9] . The success of such measures however is dependent on the adherence by the population, a factor of their awareness, knowledge, attitude and behavior.",
