            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an emerged infectious disease of swine and causes significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide (Albina, 1997). The disease was first recognized in North America in 1987 (Keffaber, 1989) and subsequently in Europe in 1990. Soon after, PRRS virus (PRRSV) was isolated as the causative agent for the disease in the USA and in The Netherlands (Benfield et al., 1992, Wensvoort et al., 1991). PRRSV has quickly become endemic in nearly all pig-producing countries and is now considered one of the most economically important pathogens of swine worldwide. PRRSV grows preferentially in porcine alveolar macrophages and establishes a persistent infection of up to 5 months in infected pigs (Allende et al., 2000, Wills et al., 1997). Although North American and European isolates of PRRSV cause similar clinical signs and share the same morphology and genome organization, they exhibit significant genetic and antigenic variations with only 63% nucleotide sequence homology at the genome level. Consequently, PRRSV is divided into two genotypes, the European genotype and North American genotype (Meng et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999, Nelson et al., 1993, Wootton et al., 2000).",

The genome is 5\u2032-capped and 3\u2032-polyadenylated (Sagripanti et al., 1986, Wootton et al., 2000) and belongs to the family Arteriviridae along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The arteriviruses are now re-grouped into the newly created order Nidovirales, together with the Coronaviridae family (Cavanagh, 1997). The PRRSV genome consists of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORFs 3 through 7), and the 3\u2032 UTR followed by a polyadenylation tail (Meulenberg et al., 1993, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Wootton et al., 2000). ORF1a and ORF1b are translated into the 1a and 1ab polyproteins, respectively, which are then proteolytically processed into 13 non-structural proteins believed to be involved in genome replication and transcription (van Dinten et al., 1999, Wootton et al., 2000, Bautista et al., 2002). ORFs 2a through 7 encode six membrane-associated proteins (GP2a, 2b or E, GP3, GP4, GP5, and M) and a nucleocapsid (N) protein, and these proteins are translated from a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (Meulenberg et al., 1995, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Wu et al., 2001).",

The N protein is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells and constitutes about 40% of the protein content in the virion (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). It is highly immunogenic in pigs and believed to be multifunctional (Rodriguez et al., 1997, Wootton et al., 1998). The N protein is a serine-phosphoprotein with unknown functions (Wootton et al., 2002). As the sole structural protein component of the viral capsid, the PRRSV N protein associates with itself by both covalent and non-covalent interactions, providing the basis for viral capsid assembly. The covalently linked N\u2013N homodimerization is formed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex through disulfide linkages via a cysteine residue at position 23 (Wootton and Yoo, 2003). Cysteine 23 of the N protein has recently been shown to be essential for virus replication and infectivity, indicating an essential role of the disulfide-linked N\u2013N homodimerization during virion assembly (Lee et al., 2005).",

Nuclear localization of N proteins has been reported for EAV, which is another arterivirus (Tijms et al., 2002), and for several coronaviruses including avian infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine, and murine hepatitis virus (Hiscox et al., 2001, Wurm et al., 2001). A functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) for the PRRSV N protein has been identified in the stretch of basic amino acids (PGKKNKK) at positions 41 to 47 and has been shown to interact with the nuclear transporters, importin-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (Rowland et al., 2003). Therefore, it is believed that the N protein localizes in the nucleus through the NLS-dependent importin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated nuclear transport pathway. It is noteworthy that the N protein nuclear localization does not require N\u2013N disulfide-linked dimerization (Lee et al., 2005). Once in the nucleus, the N protein colocalizes and specifically interacts with the small nucleolar RNA-associated protein fibrillarin, implicating an involvement of N in the ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, the N protein has been shown to be able to bind both 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA as well as the viral genomic RNA (Yoo et al., 2003). Since PRRSV assembly and maturation take place in the ER and the Golgi regions, it seems that the PRRSV N protein plays both a structural role in the cytoplasm and a non-structural role in the nucleus and/or nucleolus. The biological relevance of the N protein nuclear localization and its function during infection is presently unknown.",

Previous work using the PRRSV SDSU-23983 isolate showed that the \u2018pat7\u2019 NLS was necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of N (Rowland et al., 2003). The presence of positively charged lysine residues at 43 and 44 suggested that these two residues might constitute a core sequence responsible for the N protein nuclear localization. Lysines at 43 and 44 of 41-PGKKNKK were substituted to glycine, and a \u2018pat7-modified\u2019 mutant N gene was constructed and designated KK/43.44/GG (Figs. 1A and B). The KK/43.44/GG gene was transfected into COS-7 cells, and at 48 h post-transfection, cells were stained with the N-specific MAb SDOW-17. The wild-type N protein accumulated both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus with a distinct nucleolar staining (Fig. 1C), but expression of the KK/43.44/GG protein was restricted to the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions with no staining in the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 1C). Subcellular distribution of KK/43.44/GG protein was also examined in Marc-145 cells since this is the established cell line permissive for PRRSV infection. As with COS-7 cells, Marc-145 cells also showed cytoplasmic and perinuclear stainings but absence of staining in the nucleus, indicating that the lysines at 43 and 44 were essential amino acids for the function of the NLS of the N protein.",

            "text": "In comparison to values for other pigs within the same P129-GG group, pig 45 showed a higher viral load during viremia (5.0 \u00d7 102 PFU/ml vs. maximum mean titer of 1.3 \u00d7 101 PFU/ml), lower ELISA S/P ratios (1.002 vs. a mean of 2.757 in other P129-GG pigs at 28 days post-infection), and lower SN titers (5.7 for pig 45 vs. a GMT SN titer of 24.7 for the rest of the group at day 28). Similar values were observed in pigs infected with wild-type virus, suggesting reversion of the \u2018GGN\u2019 mutation at the NLS locus. To examine this hypothesis, plaque assays were carried out using Day 7 post-infection serum samples from pig 45. Ten well-isolated individual plaques were picked and subjected to direct extraction of RNA followed by RT-PCR for the N gene and sequencing. Fig. 6A shows the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for the NLS region of N from each plaque. The sequence data revealed that nine plaques out of 10 were mutated; six plaques mutated to 41-PGRRNKK, 41-PGRGNKK, or 41-PGGRNKK, and three plaques mutated to 43-PGKKSKK (Fig. 6A). Only one plaque out of 10 retained the original NLS-null sequence of 41-PGGGNKK. No other mutation was found elsewhere in the N gene in the ten plaques from pig 45. The mutated amino acids represented an arginine mutation at position 43 or/and 44. Since arginine may substitute for lysine without disruption of the NLS function (Horton and Nakai, 1997), the mutated plaques likely reflect functional NLS reversions (Fig. 7\n). Reversions could not be found in other pigs in the same group. Similarly, no mutation was found in the N gene of the virus isolated from pigs infected with wild-type virus. The original NLS-null mutant virus was cultivated in Marc-145 cells for 20 passages, and the N gene was sequenced from the passage 20 virus. No additional mutation was found in the N gene. These data suggest strong selection pressure at the NLS locus of N for reversion during replication of PRRSV in pigs.",

Numerous reports show that infectious virus may persist for up to 150 days following infection (Allende et al., 2000, Wills et al., 1997). In the present study, tonsils from all pigs infected with P129-GG or P129-WT were positive for the N gene by RT-PCR (Fig. 6B), indicating that all infected pigs harbored the virus in the tonsils for at least 4 weeks post-infection. No mutation was found in the N gene from the P129-WT pigs, and their sequences retained the wild-type NLS motif of 43-PGKKNKK. Pigs infected with P129-GG, however, all showed mutation of at least one nucleotide at the NLS locus, which led to an amino acid change from glycine to arginine at either position 43 or 44 (Fig. 6B). It is noteworthy that such a mutation to 43-PGRGNKK or 43-PGGRNKK represents a potentially functional \u2018pat7\u2019 NLS motif, implicating possible association of PRRSV persistence with the nuclear localization of N in the tonsils of these pigs.",

A total of four different mutation patterns were identified during viremia and persistence from NLS-null virus-infected pigs: 41-PGRGNKK, 41-PGGRNKK, 41-PGRRNKK, and 41-PGKKSKK. These mutations were subsequently introduced to the wild-type N gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Four different reversion types of N were individually transfected into Marc-145 cells for 2 days, and the cells were stained with N-specific MAb SDOW17. All four types of reversions were able to translocate the N proteins to the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 7), demonstrating that all reversions regained a functional NLS. The function of 41-PGRGNKK was somewhat unexpected, as it does not conform to the previously defined \u201cpat7\u201d NLS motif (Rowland et al., 1999, Rowland et al., 2003).",

During the past decade, however, some RNA virus proteins have been shown to localize to the nucleus and nucleolus (reviewed in Hiscox, 2003). It is postulated that these viruses have evolved to utilize nuclear functions of the cell to favor productive infections, to inhibit the synthesis of competing cellular macromolecules, or to modulate antigen presentation or innate immunity. A number of RNA virus proteins that are translocated to the nucleus and nucleolus have effects on the host cell nuclear functions through inhibition of host cell transcription, disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, and induction of nuclear herniations in order to facilitate their replication and to inhibit host antiviral responses (Aminev et al., 2003a, Aminev et al., 2003b, Amineva et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2002, Hoyt et al., 2004, Petersen et al., 2000, Sharma et al., 2004). It has been difficult, however, to study such functions in vivo using replicating virus because of the need for reverse genetics systems to generate appropriate mutants. In one study using a mutant Semliki Forest virus (a member of the alphaviruses), in mice, a single amino acid change in the NLS locus of the nsP2 protein disrupted nsP2 nuclear transport and modified the neurovirulence of the virus (Fazakerley et al., 2002, Rikkonen, 1996).",

The functional NLS has been identified in the N protein, and its nuclear interaction with fibrillarin has been characterized (Rowland et al., 2003, Yoo et al., 2003). In the present study, we investigated the biological importance of N protein nuclear localization during infection in cultured cells and in pigs. It was once speculated that the induction of CPE by PRRSV infection could be related to the nuclear localization of N protein (Rowland and Yoo, 2003). However, Marc-145 cells infected with the NLS-null mutant virus produced cytopathology indistinguishable from that of wild-type virus, but with lower viral titers and smaller size plaques. Our data demonstrate that nuclear localization of N is not related to PRRSV cytopathology and is not essential for production of infectious progeny.",

The sensitivity of virus isolation from serum specimens may be limited to 2 weeks post-infection. Other methods of virus detection with greater sensitivity such as real-time RT-PCR may have been able to detect virus after 14 days but would not distinguish infectious virus from residual viral RNA.

In our study, seroconversion was detectable by 10 days post-infection in all virus-infected pigs, but virus neutralizing antibody titers were significantly higher in P129-GG infected pigs by 3 weeks post-infection. A typical immune response to PRRSV in pigs is characterized by early production of non-neutralizing antibodies followed by the delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies between 2 and 4 weeks post-infection, which then persist at low levels. Moreover, typical titers of serum neutralizing antibodies are between 2 and 12, titers which are considered unusually low in comparison with those induced by viruses of other families (Labarque et al., 2000, Loemba et al., 1996). The role of antibodies in protection is also uncertain since PRRSV can replicate and spread in pigs even in the presence of circulating antibodies (Loemba et al., 1996, Rossow et al., 1995). In contrast, the protective effects of passively transferred PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies have been demonstrated, suggesting that serum neutralizing antibodies may be the key component for protection from PRRSV infection (Lopez and Osorio, 2004, Osorio et al., 2002). PRRSV-specific antibody-dependent enhancement of infection has also been reported (Yoon et al., 1996). In the present study, pigs infected with P129-GG had detectable SN titers by 3 weeks post-infection; titers increased to 18 by 4 weeks. It is of interest to examine whether the increased SN titers in P129-GG infected pigs contribute to better protection against PRRSV infection. In the present study, the appearance of SN antibodies coincided with disappearance of viremia after 14 days of infection. Immune responses in the P129-GG infected pigs may have led to lower viral replication and faster clearance of virus from the serum.",

            "text": "Pig 45 exhibited responses distinct from those of other animals in the P129-GG group. Direct sequencing of viral plaques demonstrated that mutation of the P129-GG virus had indeed occurred in this pig. Mutant viruses contained at least one amino acid change within the NLS locus at positions 43 through 45 of N. Mutated N proteins were able to translocate to the nucleus and nucleolus, suggesting alterations of both genotype and phenotype of the null mutant during infection. Although these changes were extremely minor at the genomic sequence level (1 or 2 nucleotide changes out of the total genome of 15,395 nucleotides), there were functional consequences during infection of the pig. Considering that the N gene is the most stable gene in PRRSV in pigs (Le Gall et al., 1998), the appearance of such reversions during the relatively short period of infection is surprising. The data suggest the presence of strong selection pressure at the NLS locus of N for functional NLS in the host.",

            "text": "PRRSV infection generally leads to virus persistence characterized by limited virus replication in the lymphoid tissues. Shedding of virus from persistently infected animals is a main factor which makes the control of PRRS difficult in the field (Allende et al., 2000, Wills et al., 1997). The mechanism of PRRS virus persistence is unknown. During persistence, structural genes are generally variable, with the exception of the N gene which is considered genetically stable (Allende et al., 2000). The genetic stability of the N gene has also been observed for EAV during persistence in stallions (Hedges et al., 1999). It is interesting to note that the EAV N protein also specifically localizes to the nucleus upon infection (Tijms et al., 2002). In the present study, both wild-type and P129-GG viruses persisted at least for 1 month in the tonsils of pigs. Surprisingly, all P129-GG viruses isolated from the tonsils of infected pigs harbored mutations at the NLS locus. In all cases, one or two nucleotide changes occurred, and these changes led to amino acid alterations from glycine to arginine at position 43 or 44 of N. The preferential mutation to arginine is explained by the fact that a single nucleotide change from \u2018G\u2019 to \u2018A\u2019 will code for arginine, whereas two nucleotide changes are required to code for lysine. No silent mutations were found in more than 18 plaques examined. The arginine mutation at position 43 or 44 reverted the NLS-null virus to a functional phenotype. Indeed, the N proteins containing an arginine mutation at 43 or 44 were all found to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus. The observation that 41-PGRGNKK was positive for NLS function was unexpected, since it deviates from the \u201cpat7\u201d motif definition of a proline followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues (K or R) out of four (Rowland et al., 1999, Rowland et al., 2003). In order to accommodate all functional sequences, the NLS motif of North American genotype PRRSV N proteins is herein expanded and redefined as a \u201cpat8\u201d motif: a proline followed within three residues by a segment containing at least three basic residues (K or R) out of five. The corresponding sequences in isolates VR-2332 and P129 are 41-PGKKNKKK and 41-PGKKSKKK, respectively. The most common functional NLS revertant found in tonsils during the present study, 41-PGRGNKKK, conforms to the pat8 (but not the pat7) pattern. A review of sequences in Genbank reveals that nearly all North American PRRSV isolates conform to the pat7 motif, but there are three exceptions. Genbank accession numbers AF043951, AY209228, AY262352 describe field isolates with NLS sequences of 41-PGKNNKKK, 41-PGKKNMKR, and 41-PGKKNNKR, respectively. The pat8 motif encompasses these and all other known North American PRRSV N protein sequences (over 70 at the time of this analysis). Collectively, our data suggest a potential correlation of the N protein nuclear localization and viral persistence or virus fitness. N protein nuclear localization may play an important role in evasion of host immune mechanisms by PRRSV.",

Throughout the study, pigs were fed an age-appropriate non-medicated diet and provided with water ad libitum. On the day of challenge, the PRRSV stocks were diluted to make 2.5 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml, and each animal was infected with a total of 5 \u00d7 104 PFU by instillation of 1 ml in each nostril. After infection, an aliquot of each inoculum was back-titrated by plaque assay to confirm the dose of infection. Clinical signs for general condition, depression, loss of appetite, coughing, sneezing, and respiratory distress were monitored and rectal temperatures were measured daily in all pigs for the first week. All pigs were weighed upon arrival at the site and at necropsy. Blood samples were taken on days 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 post-infection for virus isolation and serology. Serum samples were aliquoted and stored immediately at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. Two pigs from each treatment group were euthanized at 14 days post-infection to assess lung lesions, and the remaining pigs were euthanized at 28 days post-infection. At necropsy, the percent consolidation of each lung lobe was estimated to calculate total lung lesion severity, and a lung sample from a representative lesion was taken and immersed in formalin for histopathological examination. At Day 28 post-infection necropsy, tonsil samples were collected from remaining pigs for evaluation of viral RNA via RT-PCR. The infection study and necropsies were performed in the animal isolation facilities of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food, located at the Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). The study protocol was approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee.",
