Mycoplasma viruses (phages) may also be responsible for modifying the pathogenic power of mycoplasmas, at least for plants and insects. In addition, several mycoplasmas are able to act as undesirable cell culture contaminants that induce erroneous results in both applied and general virology. These problems are examined within a historical context.",

This biblical-like sentence could eventually serve as an introduction to the historical record of mycoplasmas and viruses as well. Indeed, during the 1890's, the first \"true\" virus, the Tobacco mosaic virus, was discovered and isolated [4, 47] from a diseased plant whereas the first mycoplasma, the \"bovine pleuropneumonia agent\" (Mycoplasma myc6ides), was cultured from sick cattle at the Pasteur Institute in Paris by Nocard et al. [72] . These two agents, although quite different in their biological properties, have been then included in the new, emerging group of \"filterable viruses\" [86] together with foot-and-mouth disease [61] and yellow fever viruses [79] . This was also the case for the \"contagious agalactia agent\" of sheep and goats (M. agalactiae) isolated some years later [8] . However, both the pleuropneumonia and the agalactia agents were visible under the microscope and were readily cultured in serum-enriched media unlike the other filterable viruses. This led to a durable confusion concerning the actual nature of\"viruses\". Many microbiologists spent unsuccessful and time-consuming efforts in order to find artificial media able to support the development of the filterable agents they were working on, and known today as true viruses.",

In comparative pathology, the strange so-called \"suckling mouse cataract agent\" (SMCA) presently known as Spiroplasma mirum has been isolated from ticks using embryonated hens' eggs [15] and considered for a long time as an arbovirus or a slow virus. Finally it was recognized as a mycoplasma [3] and more precisely as a helical mycoplasma or spiroplasma [97] . Plant mycoplasmas were initially thought to be viruses because they were transmitted biologically by sap-sucking insects as is the case for genuine plant viruses as well as for hematophagous arthropod-borne viruses. The plant mycoplasmas now known as phytoplasmas were discovered only in 1967 [25] , i.e. 69 years after the cultivation of the first animal mycoplasma [7] .",

During the summer of 1988, about 18000 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) died of pneumonia during an epizootic occurring in the North sea and Baltic sea [23, 24] . The cause of the disease was a \"new\" morbillivirus closely related to canine distemper virus, called phocine distemper virus (PDV) [74] . PDV was also found infecting grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Interestingly, in the former U.S.S.R., another mass death related to a morbillivirus has been previously reported from Lake Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica) in 1987 [40] . Since serological surveys have shown that canine distemper virus antibody was prevalent in crabeater seals (Labodon carcinophagus) in the Antartic [5] , the viral aetiology of these massive epizootics was largely accepted. This appeared particularly founded because, in 1979 and 1980, an epizootic of pneumonia has killed at least 445 harbor seals along the New England seabord, in northeastern USA, during which an influenza virus (A/Seat/Mass/i/80) has been isolated from the lungs of deceased seals [33] .",

Antibodies to M. fermentans were detected with a high frequency in HIVinfected patients [99] . Basically, the metabolism of these mycoplasmas apparently does not differ from that of other, more fully characterized species. Pollack et al. recently [77] noted that they lack cytochromes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and portions of the hexose mono-phosphate shunt. Their pathogenic potential might proceed from the generation of toxic oxygenated products that could damage the host cell membrane [77] . The question may thus be asked: What is the role of mycoplasmas in AIDS; are they only a part of many opportunistic infectious agents isolated from immunocompromised AIDS patients or synergistic, precipitating co-factors?",

In fact, it was recently shown that the drastic inhibition of HIV-1 RT as a consequence of mycoplasma contamination was due to a soluble protein with a molecular mass about 70 Kda, present in the particle-free supernatants of contaminated cultures. This RT-inhibitor had a strong DNase activity on both linear and circular DNas [27] . Such nuclease activity has been already postulated to explain RT depression observed in mycoplasma contaminated murine hybridoma cell lines producing types A and C retroviral particles [63] . On the other hand, antibody directed against the binding site of M. 9enitalium inhibited or reduced the infectivity of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in the same cells [69] and an unidentified mycoplasma significantly reduced the CD4 expression, with a consequent inhibition of gp 120 binding and HIV infection in CEM cells [75] .",
