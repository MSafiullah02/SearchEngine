            "text": "We conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine whether the sensitivity of HRV to low pH might be used to develop new treatment approaches to respiratory viral infection. A survey of common respiratory viruses showed that acid conditions inhibit the replication of most HRV serotypes, and to a lesser extent, of influenza virus. Many of the low pH buffers that were tested did not harm cell monolayers in vitro. Of the different solutions that were evaluated in tissue culture, citrate was chosen for further study because it is nontoxic, readily kills virus (2\u20134 log10 reduction in TCID50), and has a buffering capacity to remain at low pH even after it is diluted 3-fold. The in vitro model of intermittent exposure to a nasal spray suggested that, by interrupting the extracellular spread of virus, low-pH buffers may be able to either prevent or reduce the severity of clinical colds. Because the low-pH buffers lowered the nasal pH for at least 5 min and produced only minor irritation of the nose in healthy volunteers, a small-scale pilot clinical trial was performed using experimental inoculationwith HRV16. Experimental inoculation with HRV provides an attractive model to test antiviral compounds because it allows for inoculation with a standardized virus and for detailed kinetic observations of the evolution and resolution of the cold. The combination of low pH and a chelating agent reduced the amount of viral shedding during the acute cold but did not reduce common cold symptoms. Although no clinical benefits were demonstrated, the present study confirmed the feasibility of using inexpensive low pH solutions to inhibit viral replication.",

            "text": "A major question raised by these results is why the treatment was able to reduce viral shedding but not clinical symptoms. One factor was the statistical power of the study. A further possibility is that, despite having an antiviral effect, the solutions caused sensations in the nose that were confused with cold symptoms. Although the AE profile of citrate in the noses of normal volunteers was similar to that of normal saline, it is possible that this effect could be accentuated in the presence of a viral infection. An alternate explanation for the lack of clinical benefit is that a greater reduction in viral replication is needed to achieve efficacy. The 1-log reduction in viral shedding observed in the present trial is similar, however, to that reported in a clinical trial of tremacamra (soluble ICAM-1) [10] and is somewhat greater than that produced by interferon-\u03b12b or pleconaril [17, 18]. Each of these medications produced a small but significant clinical benefit in previous studies. Topical medications have an additional challenge of delivering medication to the site of infection. Infections with HRV can involve large lower airways in addition to the nasopharynx [19], and delivery to these locations might be necessary to obtain optimal clinical benefits. Finally, it is possible that the spray enhanced either cellular or neural inflammation; both of these mechanisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of cold symptoms [1, 20]. For future studies, histologic evaluation of nasal mucosal biopsy samples could provide additional information in this regard.",

In addition to citrate, phytic acid was added to the preparation used in the inoculation trial, because the combination of low pH and chelating ability helped to boost the antiviral activity of the preparation in vitro (data not shown). Preliminary experiments indicated that a low-pH preparation containing phytic acid was also well tolerated by volunteers (data not shown). From a technical standpoint, our results demonstrate that it is possible to lower the nasal pH to <4.0 in healthy human subjects by dosing with as little as 50\u2013100 \u03bcL of nasal spray. Encouragingly, effects on pH in the nasal cavity extended from anterior portion of the inferior turbinate (where the product was deposited) to the nasopharynx, indicating a broad pattern of deposition and/or spread. Overall, dilution into nasal secretions and buffering in the nasal tissues resulted in a change of only 0.5 pH units from the delivered product. This confirms that use of the spray produced a pH that is hostile to HRVs, which are generally inactivated by a 1-min exposure to pH 4.0.",
