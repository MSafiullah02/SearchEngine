Primary outcome measures were requirement for mechanical ventilation, LOS, 14-day readmission, and mortality. Descriptive statistics were shown as frequencies and percentages, or as a mean/median (range), as appropriate. Natural log transformation was applied for data with skewed distribution. P value is calculated from two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. On univariate analysis after applying Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparisons, P \u2264 0.05/3 = \u22640.016 was considered statistically significant. Multivariate analysis using ANOVA was performed controlling for age at admission, sex, race, medical unit, and number of comorbidities. P value was adjusted for multiple comparisons by Tukey's method and P \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. During summer-fall of 2014, there was an epidemic of Enterovirus D68 which cross-reacted with HRV on the respiratory viral PCR assay.[20] To account for this potential confounder, we performed a separate analysis excluding all data during this period (August 2014\u2013January 2015). All data management was performed using Microsoft Excel 2011 v. 14.5.6 and statistical analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Graphs were plotted in R (http://www.r-project.org).",

Our study results are notable in that asthma appears to be a risk factor for HRV positivity regardless of the clinical diagnosis. Research on this topic indicates that airway epithelial cells, which are the primary site of infection and replication of HRV, play a key role in this process,[23] that HRV provokes symptoms through virus-specific cytopathic effects, rather than through direct cytotoxic effects,[24] and that interleukin-8, a chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils, is a major determinant of clinical outcomes of HRV infection.[25] However, the fundamental mechanism that underlies these associations is still largely unknown.",

            "text": "The epidemic of Enterovirus D68 during summer-fall of 2014 could be a potential confounder, as this virus cross-reacts with HRV on the respiratory viral PCR assay.[20] One would expect worse clinical outcomes in HRV-positive patients, although Enterovirus D68 has similar characteristics to HRV infections,[2728] it is also associated with more severe disease.[29] However, this was not supported by our statistical analysis. When we performed a separate analysis excluding all data during this period (August 2014\u2013January 2015), we did not find substantially difference results: both HRV-positive patients and patients positive for another respiratory virus still had a significantly shorter LOS compared to patients with no respiratory virus detected (1.42 and 1.37, respectively, compared to 1.67 in log scale).",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. This was a multicenter study which included one tertiary children's hospital and several community hospitals. Hence, while we consider this a strength, the findings may not be generalizable to other settings. Our study is limited in that molecular detection of nasopharyngeal samples does not precisely correlate with lower respiratory tract involvement, and PCR results may not reflect a causative pathogen directly attributable to the patient's hospitalization. Our laboratory PCR did not differentiate between HRV species and hence it is unknown whether HRV A and B were predominantly represented in our patient population, nor whether HRV C was more common in patients who had more severe disease, as has been previously reported.[1221303132] Another limitation is that since HRV is frequently a part of coinfection, it is therefore difficult to definitively attribute findings to HRV or the other coinfecting respiratory virus. Furthermore, as the multiplex PCR panel detects a finite number of respiratory viruses, we may have missed other clinically relevant viruses including human bocavirus and coronavirus. While we adjusted for age in our multivariate analysis, we did not stratify our analysis by age group. Hence, we may have missed age-related associations.",
