Human-to-human transmission has been reported, particularly in health-care settings, but on the basis of available evidence the basic reproduction number (R0) is thought to be low, suggesting that the virus is not transmitted readily.6, 8 Therefore, the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV is probably animals. Different coronaviruses have various hosts including wildlife, livestock, poultry, pets, and human beings. Coronaviruses can adapt to new host species, as shown by the zoonotic origin of several human coronaviruses.9 Human coronavirus OC43 has recent common ancestry with bovine coronaviruses.10 Rhinolophid bats were identified as a likely reservoir for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in people in 2002\u201303, through intermediate carnivorous hosts.11 Molecular clock analysis12 showed that bat and civet strains of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV only diverged a few years before the outbreak. Human coronavirus 229E has a common ancestor with coronaviruses found in Ghanaian Hipposideros spp bats.13\n",

Three of the 12 sera reacted with MERS-CoV spike antigen but did not neutralise MERS-CoV, most likely because of recognition of non-neutralising epitopes. All MERS-CoV neutralising sera had (almost) saturating reactivity with MERS-CoV antigen on the microarray, whereas reactivity with human coronavirus OC43 antigen varied from negative to 50% of saturating reactivity (table 1). The variable human coronavirus OC43 signals suggest that MERS-CoV did not generally cross-react with human coronavirus OC43 or bovine coronavirus antigens.

All camel sera neutralised bovine coronavirus, but with varying titres, suggesting a lower cutoff than 20 000 RFU for OC43 in the microarray (figure 1). Five camels had high neutralising antibody titres against bovine coronavirus (and a mean signal intensity of greater than 50 000 RFU for human coronavirus OC43 antigen on microarray) but were negative for MERS-CoV neutralisation, suggesting that cross-neutralisation in this direction did not occur and that the MERS-CoV neutralising activity was not caused by the presence of bovine coronavirus neutralising antibodies. A serum sample from a patient who had MERS, neutralised MERS-CoV with a high titre (1/640) but neutralised bovine coronavirus less efficiently (titre 1/80). The latter finding was most probably caused by previous infection with human coronavirus OC43\u2014this patient had a high titre (1/>5120) in a human coronavirus OC43 recombinant spike immunofluorescence assay and a saturating signal with human coronavirus OC43 antigen in the microarray. Two human serum samples positive for human coronavirus OC43 did not neutralise MERS-CoV, one of which neutralised bovine coronavirus at a titre of 1/80 (table 2).",

Animal screening is necessary to understand the epidemiology of MERS-CoV. At present, bats are thought to be the ultimate reservoirs for several established human coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV. Accordingly, phylogenetic analysis has shown that MERS-CoV is related to betacoronavirus lineage C viruses found in Pipistrellus spp bats.15, 16 However, direct transmission of MERS-CoV to people from bats seems unlikely.4, 19 The identification of possible intermediate hosts that are probably in closer contact with people (eg, livestock) is urgently needed. Common livestock species in the Middle East include dromedary camels but also cattle, sheep, and goats. Based on the available data, we cannot rule out circulation of a MERS-related coronavirus in these species\u2014sera were not available from epidemiologically linked regions.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed for \u201cnovel coronavirus EMC\u201d or \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d, we identified 43 reports in English linked to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) published before July 22, 2013. None of these reports described a serological study for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in animals.\nInterpretation\nOur report describes the first MERS-CoV serological study of major livestock relevant to the Middle East. Our study shows that MERS-CoV or a related virus has infected dromedary camel populations. Both titre levels and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection of camelids with MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. Targeted studies are needed to confirm our findings and their possible relevance to human cases of MERS-CoV. Comparative seroprevalence testing of historical and more recent samples from camels from different regions for which epidemiological background information is available, as well as virological assessment of samples from seroconverting animals are needed to identify and characterise this MERS-CoV-related virus. In the meantime, we recommend a detailed case history of confirmed MERS-CoV cases, with review of any animal exposures including animal products, and targeted, prospective serosurveys to establish whether camels or their products are a potential source of human infections.",

Because the closest relatives of MERS-CoV were identified very recently in Neoromicia zuluensis bats from Africa,38 the introduction of MERS-CoV or related viruses into some African camel populations could have occurred decades ago, giving a possible explanation for MERS-CoV antibodies in camels from the Canary Islands. In the Middle East, huge numbers of camels are imported from Africa to meet the demand for meat. The top five camel breeding countries are all African, and Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are in the top five camel meat producing countries.22 This increased turnover of animals in the Middle East compared with the Canary Islands could also affect the epidemiology of a virus, through more frequent influx of immunologically naive animals.",
