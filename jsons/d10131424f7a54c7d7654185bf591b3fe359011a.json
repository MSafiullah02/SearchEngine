The disease appears to be mild in the majority of patients, however, a subset (about 15%) of affected individuals can develop a severe disease with respiratory insufficiency, that may require non-invasive or invasive ventilation and intensive care [1] . Elderly individuals and patients with co-morbidities are at higher risk of developing a severe or fatal phenotype of the disease [2]. Immunosuppressed patients might be more susceptible to COVID-19 complications due to the absence of a prompt immunological response able to clear the virus. However, it has been suggested that immunosuppression might play a protective role during COVID-19 infection by preventing or dampening the overly active immune response that, in some cases, might drive clinical deterioration [3] .",

He was previously treated with interferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod. His past medical history includes allergic rhinitis, asthma and peptic ulcer. In January 2018 treatment with ocrelizumab was started within the compassionate use program for PPMS. He also started lamivudine prophylaxis due to the presence of positive HBV anti-core antibody. Periodic 6-month ocrelizumab infusions were performed until August 2019 (a reinfusion was planned in February 2020 but was delayed due to patient convenience and rescheduled in March 2020). At the time of the last infusion patient had moderate hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 6.5 g/L, reference range 8-17 g/l) with normal IgM and IgA levels, and peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotype showed profound B-cell depletion (8 CD19+ cell/mm 3 ).

Blood exam showed normal leucocyte and T lymphocyte count (7.79\u00d710^9 cells/L, range 4.90-9.80 and 1.50\u00d710^9 cells/L, range 1.10-4.80, respectively), with elevated C-reactive protein (63.1 mg/L, range 0-5), slight increase of interleuchin-6 (IL-6) levels (6 pg/ml, range 0-3.4), and moderate IgG hypogammaglobulinemia (6.5 g/L). Chest X-ray was unremarkable. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on nasal swab and tested positive on two samples. Arterial blood gas test showed normal blood oxygenation. Patient was treated with symptomatic therapy for high fever (paracetamol), with resolution of symptoms in two days. He was discharged to home-quarantine on March the 13 th with normal leukocyte and lymphocyte count (5.13\u00d710^9/L cell/L and 1.63\u00d710^9/L) and reduced C reactive protein levels (16.4 mg/L). Peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotype, performed upon admission, confirmed a complete B-cell depletion (1 CD19+ cell/mm 3 ), as expected by ocrelizumab drug pharmacodynamic. Phone interview, performed on March the 28 th , confirmed that patient is still home-quarantined, without occurrence of any new symptoms.",

We speculate that the persistence of B cells within secondary lymphoid organs, associated with a moderately reduced immune response due to lack of peripheral B cells might have played a favorable role in this patient. The lack of significant increase of IL-6 (that might be released by the peripheral B cells) seems to support our hypothesis. If confirmed by larger case series, our observation might indicate that patients who undergo B cell depletion could be protected from serious complications of COVID-19 and might support the use of selective immunosuppressant such as tocilizumab in serious COVID-19 cases.",
