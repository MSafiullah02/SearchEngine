Moreover, vernakalant inhibits cardiac sodium channels in a voltage-and frequency-dependent manner. 8 However, whether intravenous vernakalant facilitates ECV of cardioversion-resistant AF is unknown and was consequently tested in this non-randomized observational study.",

The most common cause of the failure of electrical CV to result in sinus rhythm is IRAF, which may occur in up to 26% of patients The failure of transthoracic shocks to restore sinus rhythm has been largely obviated by treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs 11 and by the use of biphasic shocks. 12 Several drugs with antiarrhythmic properties have been tested to facilitate unsuccessful electrical CV caused by IRAF and FECV. Both, amiodarone and verapamil were effective in preventing IRAF in 50%. 13 Ibutilide that is not available in many European countries was 95% effective in 22 amiodarone-or sotalol-pretreated patients 14 -a different cohort than our antiarrhythmic-na\u00efve patients. However, ibutilide was frequently associated with sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. More recently, ranolazine has been reported to be effective to support restoration of sinus rhythm after unsuccessful ECV in 19 of 25 (76%) patients. 15 The findings of our study attest vernakalant a possible new indication in the case of cardioversion-resistant AF as the rate of sinus rhythm restoration was quite high and the drug was well tolerated. Our results imply a significantly higher success rate for treatment with vernakalant compared with amiodarone in patients with AF recurrence after previous AF ablation. Larger studies will have to confirm this finding. Despite additional costs for medication, drugfacilitated cardioversion can lead to shorter hospitalization and might therefore be cost-effective. 16 Mechanisms that may lead to the suppression of IRAF and reduced defibrillation threshold include the suppression of premature atrial contractions and atrial or pulmonary vein tachycardia, as well as a reduction of atrial refractoriness heterogeneity.",

Chest radiography showed enlargement of the right cardiac margin and a right-sided stomach ( Figure 1A) . Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a right-sided stomach and spleen ( Figure 1B) . Echocardiography revealed normal heart structure, and chest CT indicated normal cardiac and pulmonary situs. Three-dimensional reconstruction CT ( Figure 1C , D) and angiography indicated interrupted inferior vena cava with azygos continuation to the right superior vena cava and hepatic vein draining into the right atrium. Slow pathway ablation was performed at the posterior aspect of Koch's triangle. Isolated abdominal visceral heterotaxy with interrupted inferior vena cava and azygos continuation is very rare.The full-length version of this report can be viewed at: http://www.escardio. org/communities/EHRA/publications/ep-case-reports/Documents/ Slow-pathway-ablation.
