The inauguration of President Obama on January 20, 2009, attracted a crowd of 1.8 million to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.; a state of emergency was declared to allow the release of federal money and resources. Protests during the Arab Spring in 2011 drew millions of largely peaceful protesters to central locations of Tunis, Tunisia, and Cairo, Egypt. More than 5 million were present when the departure of Egypt\u2019s President Hosni Mubarak was announced in February, 2011.1 Millions of people celebrated the 2014 World Cup in Brazil without significant problems; it seems that lessons have been learned from previous soccer disasters (Table 202-1\n).",

Once identified, those providing medical care at mass gatherings need to liaise with local emergency medical services (EMS), fire, and law enforcement officials. Ground and building plans, close estimates of possible attendance, and identification of any specific hazards should be shared among these providers.

Training of security staff in crowd control should be implemented before an event to improve crowd safety and avoid panic should overcrowding occur. During a football match in Ellis Park, South Africa, tear gas was thrown into a crowd by event security in an effort to disperse intense overcrowding. This, unfortunately, served to incite panic and caused a stampede (Table 202-1).9 Keeping the crowd comfortable and relaxed is also essential, therefore awnings, cooling fans (in hot weather), and entertainment are sometimes helpful and should be part of the preplanning.",

Staffing levels and type of staffing also need to be anticipated. Recommended ratios include one to two physicians per 50,000 attendees, two paramedics or one paramedic and one emergency medical technician per 10,000 attendees, and one basic first aid provider per 1000 participants at the event.16 On-site physicians have been shown to reduce ambulance transfers to local hospitals by as much as 89%,17 significantly lessening the impact of an event on local EMS services and hospitals. The majority of nondisaster injuries and medical complaints at a mass gathering can be effectively treated at the scene, which reduces the number of hospital referrals and patient presentation rates to the hospital. Physician presence should be strongly encouraged at events where significant trauma may occur or where there is a long distance to definitive care. Cardiac arrest cases are rare in mass gatherings, with reports of 0.5 to 1 per 500,000, though on-site resuscitation and early defibrillation are important and can improve patient survival rates.18\n",

Fixed events at stadiums may have areas specially designed and designated for medical care. For other events, aid station locations should be no more than a 5-minute walk for attendees. Stations should be clearly visible, and the locations should be known to participants and other event personnel. These areas need to be adequately and appropriately staffed before the anticipated start of the event, and remain so until the event is completed. Consideration needs to be given to providing medical care in the crowd for occurrences such as cardiac arrest or lower extremity fractures, including how to transport these patients to aid stations. Thought needs to be given regarding provision of ambulances for hospital transport and access and egress for these vehicles. The organizers of medical care need to know the capabilities of local hospitals and should liaise with hospital personnel before the event. All patient encounters should be documented. Use of noncarbon record (NCR) paper will facilitate a copy accompanying a patient who needs transport to a medical facility. Records are needed for medical and legal reasons and may also be useful for research purposes.\n\n\n",

Heat exhaustion is common during the hot cycle of the Hajj. Cases of heat stroke doubled from 1980 to 1981. This could be overcome by educating pilgrims before and during the event. Infectious disease outbreaks are also common. These include meningococcal meningitis; gastroenteritis; hepatitis A, B, and C; and various zoonotic diseases. The implementation of vaccination policies, infection control policies, and public health initiatives have proven successful in addressing these problems.40 Pilgrims need proof of appropriate vaccinations to obtain a visa for travel to Saudi Arabia. Face mask use is encouraged to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. Some of the mitigation actions taken at the Hajj are discussed in Table 202-5\n. The 2014 Hajj faced particular infectious threats with both Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola virus outbreaks in nearby regions.",

It identified the need for police and sports authorities to cooperate in ensuring segregation of rival supporters, controlling access to stadiums, and banning the consumption of alcohol. After the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in England, the Gibson Report recommended medical care at stadiums for the first time. All-seat stadiums were to be phased in, leading to safer stadiums with greater attendance. The Boston Marathon has instituted a post-event clinic that is open for 3 days after the event to meet the delayed medical needs of runners.",

This may be treated by laying the patient supine with the legs elevated and rehydrating with oral electrolyte or carbohydrate solution. Dehydration should be assessed clinically and treated with oral fluids. Heat-related illnesses are addressed in the usual fashion.
