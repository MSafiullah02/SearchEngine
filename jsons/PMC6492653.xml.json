AICAR alone provided a 40% increase in protection, whereas the AICAR/pioglitazone combination increased survival by 60%.

In addition, significantly higher levels of CD4 +  and CD8 +  lymphocytes and less pulmonary inflammation were found in the group receiving triple therapy. Mesalazine inhibits lipoxygenase and COX pathways, which can lead to reduction in pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids and therefore reduced activation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils.

Evaluation of specific neutralizing antibody titers in IVIGs for severe and/or drug\u2010resistant influenza virus infections is needed especially in the immunocompromised. Systemic corticosteroids should not be used routinely in severe viral infection such as influenza as it may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity (e.g. secondary infections), especially when there is delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy. It is worthwhile to explore the immunomodulating efficacy of NAC, macrolide, acute use of statins, PPAR agonists \u00b1 AMPK, and celecoxib \u00b1 mesalazine with more animal and detailed human observational studies and preferably RCTs.
