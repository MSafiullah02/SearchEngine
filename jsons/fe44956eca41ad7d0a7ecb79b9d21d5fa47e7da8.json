Pulmonary hypertension is synonymous with an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), a product of steady-state vascular resistance. The most commonly recognized cause of pulmonary hypertension in cattle is hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and remodeling associated with high-altitude exposure. Respiratory disease, however, may also lead to increased mPAP by predisposing affected individuals to alveolar hypoxia (Holt and Callan, 2007) and, in severe cases, reducing pulmonary vascular capacity through fibrosis and obliteration of pulmonary vessels. Feedlot cattle treated for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) were three times more likely to die of congestive right heart failure than cattle that did not require treatment (Neary et al., 2016a) . It has also been determined that cattle with the greatest mPAP as suckling calves typically have the greatest mPAP through the confined feeding phase (Neary et al., 2015) ; consequently, interventions that reduce mPAP in the cow-calf phase may have beneficial carryover health effects as cattle enter the next phase of production.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 563, "end": 586, "text": "(Holt and Callan, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 875, "end": 896, "text": "(Neary et al., 2016a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1069, "text": "(Neary et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The purposes of this study were to determine if healthy calves that were successfully treated for 1 BRD during the suckling phase had significantly greater mPAP than healthy herdmates that did not require treatment for BRD and, to screen for associations between the blood leukogram and mPAP.
