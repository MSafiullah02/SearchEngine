Viral infections induce a variety of outcomes in eukaryotic cells depending on the cell type, the virus, and the conditions at the time of infection. Although eukaryotic cells have a number of antiviral defense mechanisms, viruses have developed various countermeasures to evade host responses. Among the primary host defense mechanisms, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and the interferon (IFN) system are particularly important to combat viral infections. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that mitochondria play a central role in host antiviral responses, and a number of viral proteins localize in mitochondria and interact with mitochondrial proteins. In this article, we review recent findings on mitochondrial responses to viral infections.",

EBV produces small RNA molecules that induce RIG-I-mediated IFN production (Samanta et al., 2006). Recently, Chen and colleagues reported that DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol-III), which is responsible for synthesizing 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA from cytosolic poly(dA-dT) DNA, is a potent mediator of RIG-I signaling induced by HSV-1 or adenovirus infection (Chiu et al., 2009). These studies indicate that RLRs are important cytoplasmic detectors of DNA and RNA viruses.",

IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1; also referred to as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein [MAVS], Cardif, or VISA) was characterized as a RIG-I binding protein (Kawai et al., 2005, Meylan et al., 2005, Seth et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2005). IPS-1/MAVS consists of a C-terminal effector domain and an N-terminal CARD that interacts with two CARDs from RIG-I or MDA5. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that IPS-1/MAVS is localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria (Seth et al., 2005). After activation by RLRs, IPS-1/MAVS recruits downstream signaling molecules from various cascades to activate and translocate transcription factors (e.g., IRF-3 or NF-\u03baB), resulting in the production of type I IFNs (Fig. 1\n). Moreover, recent reports suggest that two other mitochondria-associated proteins\u2014stimulator of IFN genes (STING), which resides mainly in the ER, and the mitochondrial tethering protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2)\u2014are involved in RLR signaling as signal transducers or MAVS-interacting proteins (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008, Yasukawa et al., 2009, Zhong et al., 2008). These findings show that mitochondria are key organelles for innate immunity that activate the production of IFNs.",

            "text": "Autonomous inhibition of RLR-induced signals is necessary to prevent pathologically excessive responses and the development of autoimmune disease, and the negative regulators of RLR-induced signals have recently been identified. LGP2, which does not contain a CARD, coimmunoprecipitates with MAVS and competes with the downstream kinase IKK\u03b5 for a common interaction site on MAVS (Komuro and Horvath, 2006). The C-terminal region of LGP2 associates with and inhibits auto-oligomerization of RIG-I (Saito et al., 2007). NLRX1, a member of the NLR family, is localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with MAVS. Functional analyses suggested that NLRX1 acts as a negative regulator of RLR-MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling (Moore et al., 2008). The Atg5\u2013Atg12 conjugate, a key regulator of autophagy, has also been shown to inhibit RLR signaling by directly binding to RIG-I, MDA5, and IPS-1 (Jounai et al., 2007). Autophagy is a physiologically and immunologically controlled intracellular homeostatic pathway that sequesters and degrades macromolecular aggregates, cellular organelles such as mitochondria, and whole microbes or their products (Delgado et al., 2009). Iwasaki and colleagues observed increased levels of mitochondrial mass and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in Atg5-deficient cells, suggesting that absence of autophagy resulted in reactive oxygen species-dependent amplification of RLR signaling (Tal et al., 2009). Fig. 1 depicts mitochondrial proteins involved in the induction and inhibition of innate immune responses to viral infections.",

            "text": "MAVS consists of 540 amino acid (aa) residues and contains three functional domains. These include an N-terminal CARD (aa 10\u201377) and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (aa 514\u2013535). These two domains are connected via a proline-rich region (aa 103\u2013173) that functions as the third domain (Kawai et al., 2005, Seth et al., 2005). The CARD of MAVS interacts with those of RLRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5. MAVS is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane via its C-terminal transmembrane domain, which is structurally similar to transmembrane domains of other mitochondrial proteins such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and TOM20 (Seth et al., 2005). A C-terminal-truncated form of MAVS, which lacked the transmembrane domain, was detected in the cytosol and failed to mediate RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. Recent studies demonstrated that homodimerization of MAVS via its transmembrane domains is critical for innate immune signaling (Baril et al., 2009, Tang and Wang, 2009). The proline-rich region in MAVS mediates binding to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family proteins TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 (Saha et al., 2006, Xu et al., 2005). MAVS lacking the proline-rich region, however, is still capable of activating IFN-\u03b2 production (Seth et al., 2005). TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) also interacts with MAVS via the central region. Tschopp and colleagues demonstrated that the level of IFN-\u03b2 production induced by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection was lower in TRADD-deficient mice and suggested that TRADD recruits TRAF3/TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK) and FADD/RIP1 to form a larger complex, leading to activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB (Michallet et al., 2008).",

Li and colleagues reported that MAVS splicing variants 1a (exon 2 deletion) and 1b (exon 3 deletion), due to a frame shift by exon deletion, consist of 131 aa and 124 aa residues, respectively (Lad et al., 2008). Both MAVS 1a and 1b contain the putative CARD, which enables them to receive RLR signals. However, MAVS 1a and 1b show opposite effects on RLR-MAVS-mediated IFN production. MAVS 1a lacks the signaling domain to transmit signals downstream and acts as a competitor in MAVS full length-mediated signaling. MAVS 1b can interact with FADD and RIP1 (downstream of RLR signaling) and selectively activate IFN-\u03b2 production (Lad et al., 2008). These results suggest that MAVS signaling can be negatively regulated by its own splice variants.",

Zhong and colleagues showed that MITA/STING was anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane and that it induced IFN-\u03b2 production by interacting with MAVS (Zhong et al., 2008). Ishikawa and colleagues, however, reported that STING was located on the ER (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008) and translocated from ER to Sec-5-containing vesicles in response to HSV-1 infection, suggesting that STING functions in DNA-mediated innate immunity (Ishikawa et al., 2009). It has also been demonstrated that STING translocates from ER to the Golgi apparatus and colocalizes with TBK1 (Saitoh et al., 2009). Dimerization of ERIS/STING is critical for self-activation and IFN production (Sun et al., 2009).

MFN1 plays a major role in mitochondrial fusion, whereas MFN2 tethers ER to mitochondria. MFN2 is enriched at the ER-mitochondria interface, and disruption of ER-mitochondria interactions are observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which MFN2 expression has been silenced (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008). The Ras-binding domain of MFN2 is required for the tethering function (de Brito and Scorrano, 2009). Recently, Yasukawa and colleagues reported that MAVS-dependent activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter was inhibited by coexpression of MFN2. Knockdown of endogenous MFN2 expression with siRNA enhanced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation induced by measles virus infection and poly(I:C). Heptad region 1 of MFN2 interacts with the central region of MAVS, which is necessary to interact with downstream effectors for IFN production, suggesting that MFN2 acts as an RLR signaling inhibitor (Yasukawa et al., 2009). In Sendai virus H4-infected cells, RLR activation promotes mitochondrial elongation mediated by MFN1, resulting in MAVS-STING interaction at the mitochondria-ER site (Castanier et al., 2010). Thus, MFN1 and MFN2 appear to play opposite roles in antiviral responses. These studies strongly suggest that the contact sites between ER and mitochondria and the mitochondrial-associated membrane play critical roles as signal mediators during host cell antiviral responses.",

Bcl-2 contains four distinct Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1\u20134). The Bcl-2 family is composed of three subfamilies: the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 subfamily (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), the proapoptotic BH1-3 domain-containing Bax subfamily (e.g., Bax and Bak), and the proapoptotic BH3-only subfamily (e.g., Bid, Bad, and Bim). Bax and Bak assemble on the mitochondrial and ER membranes, where they function as channels or pores and mediate MMP, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and calcium, respectively (Kuwana et al., 2002, Nutt et al., 2002, Wei et al., 2001). Bcl-2/Bcl-xL forms an inhibitory antiapoptotic complex with activated Bax/Bak. One proapoptotic mechanism involves BH3-only proteins binding activated Bax/Bak instead of the repressor Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (Chen et al., 2005). In the second model, Bax plays an important role in rapid transbilayer reorganization of lipids (Terrones et al., 2004), and the resulting curvature stress in the mitochondrial outer membrane induces the formation of large pores (Basa\u00f1ez et al., 2002). Permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane via activation of PTPC is induced by specific stimuli such as calcium overload and reactive oxygen species (Deniaud et al., 2008). Furthermore, it has been suggested that PTPC is regulated by several factors including mitochondrial matrix proteins (e.g., cyclophilin D), intermembrane space proteins (e.g., creatinine kinase), and outer membrane-associated proteins (e.g., peripheral benzodiazepine receptor [PBR]) (Galluzzi et al., 2008, Halestrap, 2009, Kumarswamy and Chandna, 2009). Moreover, Bax and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL have been shown to modulate PTPC activity. Numerous studies have identified viral antiapoptotic (Table 1\n) and proapoptotic proteins (Table 2\n), some of which exhibit Bcl-2 family-like functions or structures. We briefly summarize the functions of those viral proteins in the following section.",

E1A induces apoptosis by activating p53 or sensitizing cells to death receptor ligands (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, FasL, and TRAIL) (White, 2001). Bik, a member of the BH3-only subfamily, plays a crucial role in ADV-induced apoptosis (Shimazu et al., 2007). Indeed, Bik is activated by ADV infection, and siRNA-mediated depletion of Bik inhibits apoptosis in ADV-infected cells (Subramanian et al., 2007). E1A-induced cell death is blocked by the E1B-19K protein, which was initially identified as a viral Bcl-2 homolog (White, 2001, White et al., 1991). Like Bcl-2, E1B-19K is primarily located near mitochondria, which allows E1B-19 K to inhibit multimeric pore formation by Bax subfamily members (Han et al., 1996).",

CrmA is a general caspase inhibitor (Ray et al., 1992), whereas the latter two are viral Bcl-2-type proteins. F1L is responsible for the remaining antiapoptotic activity in viruses lacking CrmA (Wasilenko et al., 2003). F1L localizes to the mitochondria via its C-terminal region and interferes with apoptosis by inhibiting the loss of the inner \u0394\u03c8m and the release of cytochrome c (Wasilenko et al., 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated that F1L contains highly divergent BH domains (Campbell et al., 2010, Kvansakul et al., 2008), which likely allow F1L to interact with Bak constitutively and prevent Bak activation. During infection, F1L replaces the functions of cellular antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1 (Campbell et al., 2010). In addition, F1L binds and specifically inhibits caspase-9 (Zhai et al., 2010). These results suggest that F1L functions both as a suppressor of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and as an inhibitor of caspase-9, thereby neutralizing two sequential steps in the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Several F1L orthologs have been identified in other poxviruses such as variola virus, monkeypox virus, and ectromelia virus. The antiapoptotic activity of the ectromelia virus ortholog has been demonstrated (Wasilenko et al., 2003). The N1 protein encoded by the N1L gene is structurally similar to Bcl-xL and other members of the Bcl-2 subfamily. Moreover, N1 inhibits apoptosis by binding to BH-3 motifs of proapoptotic proteins (Cooray et al., 2007).",

The highly conserved UL37 gene encodes vMIA, which is essential for viral replication. vMIA inhibits apoptosis induced by a number of stimuli including ligation of death receptor, infection with E1B-19K-deleted ADV, and exposure to cytotoxic drugs (Goldmacher, 2002). vMIA is localized on the mitochondrial membrane via a mitochondrial transmembrane domain and forms a complex with ANT, a constituent member of PTPC. It is thought that vMIA inhibits opening of PTPC and subsequent MMP by forming a complex with ANT (Goldmacher, 2002). vMIA also interacts with Bax, resulting in translocation of the complex to mitochondria and inhibition of pore formation with multimeric Bax (Arnoult et al., 2004). Because the antiapoptotic effects of vMIA are not observed in Bax-deficient cells, vMIA may exert its antiapoptotic functions solely by neutralizing Bax (Arnoult et al., 2004). Viral inhibitor of caspase-8 activation (vICA or UL36 protein) inhibits Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis (Skaletskaya et al., 2001). Activation of caspase-8 causes crosstalk and activation of the intrinsic pathway via the generation and translocation of truncated Bid (tBid) (Galluzzi et al., 2008). UL36/vICA may inhibit MMP caused by the crosstalk effect. Murine CMV (mCMV) encodes an antiapoptotic protein called viral inhibitor of Bak oligomerization (vIBO). vIBO blocks Bak-mediated cytochrome c release and apoptosis, suggesting that vIBO and vMIA (m38.5 protein in mCMV) have complimentary effects (Cam et al., 2010). CMV infection protects cells from apoptosis induced by rotenone, a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory complex I. This protection is mediated by a virally encoded 2.7-kb RNA fragment (\u03b22.7) that interacts with complex I and prevents localization of the essential subunit genes associated with retinoid/interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19). Thus, \u03b22.7 RNA stabilizes mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, resulting in consistent ATP production, cell survival, and completion of the viral life cycle (Reeves et al., 2007).",

            "text": "EBV is a \u03b3-herpesvirus that establishes a latent infection in B lymphocytes and eventually transforms cells. This virus encodes two Bcl-2 homologs: BHRF1 and BALF1 (Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005, Bellows et al., 2002, Henderson et al., 1993). BHRF1 and Bcl-2 have similar localization profiles, three-dimensional structures, and positive effects on cell survival (Hickish et al., 1994, Huang et al., 2003). Indeed, BHRF1 suppresses MMP and apoptosis induced by such stimuli as c-myc activation (Fanidi et al., 1998), heterologous viral infection (Tarodi et al., 1994), gamma radiation, and antitumor chemotherapeutic drugs (McCarthy et al., 1996). BHRF1 markedly inhibits TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, followed by caspase-8 activation and loss of \u0394\u03c8m (Kawanishi et al., 2002). Unlike Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, BHRF1 lacks an exposed, preformed BH-3 binding groove and thus cannot sequester and inhibit proapoptotic BH-3-only proteins (Huang et al., 2003). The ability of BHRF1 to bind proapoptotic BH-3-only subfamily member Bim, but not Bak, provides protection, however. Interestingly, a relatively small amount of Bim is bound by BHRF1 when compared to the level of Bim expression induced by apoptosis. Although the mechanism remains unclear, BHRF1 may function through Bim to block apoptosis (Desbien et al., 2009). BALF1, another Bcl-2 homolog, also interacts with proapoptotic Bax and Bak (Marshall et al., 1999) and may antagonize the effects of BHRF1 (Bellows et al., 2002), whereas the role of BALF1 during the viral life cycle is still controversial. In addition, the nuclear antigens EBNA3A and EBNA3C, both of which are required in lymphoblastoid cell lines, are antiapoptotic. EBNA3A and EBNA3C cooperate as major determinants in downregulating the expression of the BH-3-only subfamily member Bim (Anderton et al., 2008). Because Bim is a critical regulator of B-cell survival and is a tumor suppressor in B cells, depletion of Bim by the nuclear EBNA3 proteins may facilitate EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis. EBNA-leader protein (LP) interferes with host transcription and the cytoplasmic apoptotic machinery (Kawaguchi et al., 2000, Matsuda et al., 2003). EBNA-LP interacts with Bcl-2 via cellular HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), a mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis that is regulated by Omi/HtrA2 (Cilenti et al., 2004, Matsuda et al., 2003).",

KSHV ORF16 encodes Kaposi's sarcoma-associated Bcl-2 (KSBcl-2), overexpression of which blocks apoptosis as efficiently as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or EBV BHRF1. The inhibitory mechanism of KSBcl-2 is different from that of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, as KSBcl-2 did not interact with other Bcl-2 family members (Cheng et al., 1997). KSHV K7 is structurally related to survivin-DeltaEx3, a splice variant of human survivin that protects cells from apoptosis via an undefined mechanism. K7 contains a mitochondria-targeting sequence, an N-terminal baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) domain, and a putative BH2-like domain. The BIR domain of K7 mediates binding to the effector caspase-3. However, the K7 antiapoptotic activity also requires the BH2-like domain, which is essential for the interaction with Bcl-2 (Wang et al., 2002). Thus, K7 may act as an adaptor for Bcl-2. K7 can also modulate the intracellular calcium concentration by interacting with the cellular calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) (Feng et al., 2002) and protein linking integrin-associated protein and cytoskeleton 1 (PLIC1), a regulator of the ubiquitin system (Feng et al., 2004). These observations indicate that the mitochondrial membrane-associated protein K7 may provide a platform for antiapoptotic processes. KSHV encodes other antiapoptotic proteins including K13 (a viral Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin 1\u03b2 converting enzyme inhibitory protein [vFLIP]) and the mitochondrial protein K15. The antiapoptotic activity of vFLIP/K13 has been attributed to inhibition of caspase-8 activation (Guasparri et al., 2004) and expression of antiapoptotic proteins via NF-\u03baB activation (Sun et al., 2003). K15 localizes to mitochondria and ER and interacts with HAX-1 (Sharp et al., 2002), which can bridge Bcl-2 and EBNA-LP to promote cell survival (Matsuda et al., 2003).",

Although homology between M11 and Bcl-2 is limited, structural analysis revealed that M11 has a BH3 binding groove that can sequester Bax and Bak (Loh et al., 2005). Moreover, viruses harboring a mutation that caused defective BH3 binding exhibited impaired persistent replication and reactivation from latency in vivo (Loh et al., 2005). Recently, a novel viral mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein (vMAP) encoded by the M8 gene was identified (Feng et al., 2007).

In mature human keratinocytes, E1^E4 binds and collapses the cytokeratin network (Doorbar et al., 1991). Thereafter, E1^E4 translocates to mitochondria via an N-terminal leucine-rich region and induces the detachment of mitochondria from microtubules. The detached mitochondria then aggregate adjacent to the nucleus, which is followed by dissipation of \u0394\u03c8m and apoptosis. Other proapoptotic proteins encoded by E6 and E7 are multifunctional, at times preventing p53-induced apoptosis (E6) (Scheffner et al., 1990). E6 and E7 reportedly sensitize cells to several apoptotic stimuli in a manner that may or may not depend on p53 (Brown et al., 1997, Iglesias et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2000, Vikhanskaya et al., 2002).",

Moreover, HCV encodes antiapoptotic proteins. NS2 is an ER-associated transmembrane protein that acts as an inhibitor of cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector B (CIDE-B)-induced apoptosis (Erdtmann et al., 2003). NS5A is also detected on ER of HCV-infected cells. This protein activates NF-\u03baB to prevent cell death induced by ER stress (Waris et al., 2002).

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes six accessory proteins that are not found in other classes of retroviruses. Viral protein R (Vpr) is a strong inducer of apoptosis (Stewart et al., 1997, Yao et al., 1998). When added to intact cells or purified mitochondria, synthetic Vpr causes rapid dissipation of \u0394\u03c8m and release of intermembrane space proteins through direct interactions with ANT or VDAC, components of the mitochondria PTPC (Jacotot et al., 2000). In lymphoid cells, Vpr-mediated MMP is facilitated by Bax binding to ANT, whereas it is prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression and PTPC inhibitors (Jacotot et al., 2000). Vpr is dispensable for HIV replication in T cells but not in macrophages. Interestingly, an R77Q mutation in Vpr abrogates its proapoptotic activity (Lum et al., 2003), suggesting that Vpr may be a crucial virulence factor during HIV infection. HIV envelope glycoprotein complex triggers MMP through a complex signal transduction pathway (Castedo et al., 2001, Perfettini et al., 2004). Tat also triggers apoptosis in infected and solely expressed cells and may cause neurodegeneration (Kruman et al., 1998, Li et al., 1995). Expression of Tat causes loss of \u0394\u03c8m, reactive oxygen species overproduction, and caspase activation (Macho et al., 1999). Tat alters microtubule dynamics, which promotes proteasomal degradation of microtubule-associated protein 2 and activates apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway (Aprea et al., 2006, Chen et al., 2002, Egel\u00e9 et al., 2008). As a proapoptotic relative of Bcl-2 and transducer of death signals initiated by perturbed microtubule dynamics, Bim facilitates Tat-induced apoptosis (Chen et al., 2002). Nef protein induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of Bax activator into the cytosol (Laforge et al., 2007). HIV-1 protease processes caspase-8, which processes Bid to its activated form (tBid) (Nie et al., 2002).",

Interestingly, levels of cellular ATP and lactate as well as \u0394\u03c8m are maintained for at least 6 h after infection before decreasing at later stages (Murata et al., 2000a). Earlier studies demonstrated that mitochondrial protein synthesis in HSV-infected cells decreases progressively, dropping to about 60% of normal levels (Latchman, 1988, Lund and Ziola, 1986). Moreover, mitochondria exhibit a gradual decline in the rate of calcium uptake, which reaches 65% of the control rate at later stages of infection (Lund and Ziola, 1985). These observations indicate that mitochondrial activity is negatively regulated by HSV infection. It is known that the viral assembly site of ASFV is cytoplasmic and surrounded by various organelles, including mitochondria (Rojo et al., 1998). Cristae condensation is observed at this position, indicating that the mitochondria are actively respiring. Accordingly, ASFV envelopment and capsid formation depend on calcium gradients and ATP (Cobbold et al., 2000). Thus, mitochondria surrounding the viral assembly site likely supply energy for viral morphogenesis. In HSV-infected cells, however, there is no evidence of enhanced mitochondrial activity, and the actual effects of mitochondrial clustering are not entirely clear.",

            "text": "The genomes of HSV-1 and HSV-2 encode a viral serine/threonine protein kinase, US3, which is conserved in \u03b1-herpesviruses. US3 is not essential for viral replication in cell culture but is important for various aspects of HSV replication and pathogenesis (Kato et al., 2008, Kurachi et al., 1993, Reynolds et al., 2002). US3 expression markedly affects a number of signal transduction pathways including JNK (Murata et al., 2000b) and PKB/Akt pathways (Benetti and Roizman, 2006), and it is responsible for inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport in HSV-1-infected cells (Derakhshan et al., 2006). US3 protein kinase phosphorylates a large number of cellular and viral proteins in infected cells (Mou et al., 2007, Nishiyama, 2004, Roizman et al., 2007). Most importantly, US3 has a potent antiapoptotic activity in transfected and infected cells (Hata et al., 1999, Murata et al., 2002). For example, US3 is sufficient to block apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bad, Bid, and Bax (Munger and Roizman, 2001, Ogg et al., 2004). These results suggest that US3 exerts antiapoptotic effects via direct and/or indirect interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins. However, the precise mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic effects of US3 is still unknown (Benetti and Roizman, 2004, Mori et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2006). Recently, we demonstrated that a US3-inactivated HSV mutant showed selective and potent oncolytic activity against pancreatic tumor cells, suggesting that deletion of US3 is a promising approach for the development of oncolytic HSV (Kasuya et al., 2007).",

Innate immune signals initiated at RLRs converge on mitochondria-associated adaptor molecules, which may prevent excessive immune responses that could be harmful to host organisms. In addition, recent studies have proposed another role for MAVS, that is, a proapoptotic activity for a non-CARD of MAVS in virus-infected cells (Lei et al., 2009, Yu et al., 2010). Further analyses are necessary to understand how the various roles of MAVS are regulated during early antiviral responses and the relationship between RLR ligand binding and MAVS-induced cell death. In this review, we have also described the profiles of mitochondria in HSV-infected cells, although the biological significance of these results is not entirely clear. Studies of the roles of mitochondria during viral infections will likely provide significant insights into immune responses and broaden our understanding of this multifunctional organelle.",

            "text": "Fig.\u00a01: RLR-mediated viral recognition and pathways leading to IFN-\u03b2 production. Cytosolic viral RNA and DNA are recognized by RIG-I, MDA5, DAI, or other unknown DNA sensors. Cytosolic double-strand DNA is recognized by cytosolic DNA receptors such as DAI, or, in another pathway, cytosolic DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol-III) synthesizes 5\u2032-triphosphate single-stranded RNA, which is recognized by RIG-I. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize long or short viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or 5\u2032-triphosphate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) via their C-terminal RNA helicase domain. The two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) then interact with an N-terminal CARD from mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; also referred to as IPS-1, Cardif, and VISA). Anchored to mitochondria via a C-terminal transmembrane domain, MAVS receives signals from RLRs via a CARD and transduces the signal to downstream proteins via other regions including a proline-rich region that interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF3 and a central region that interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated-death domain (TRADD) and TRAF6. TRAF2 and TRAF3 interact with TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK). TANK recruits a kinase complex composed of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK\u03b5, which phosphorylates IRF3 and activation of IFN-\u03b2 transcription. TRADD interacts with TRAF3 and Rip1, whereas TRAF6 interacts with Rip1. Rip1 mediates signals between Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Negative regulators of MAVS-mediated signals are also shown. Interactions between laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and MAVS or RIG-I antagonize RIG-I/MAVS-mediated signaling. NLRX1 localizes to mitochondria and interacts with MAVS, leading to inhibition of signaling. Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), a mitochondrial tethering GTPase, interacts with MAVS via the heptad region of MFN2, which interferes with interactions between MAVS and various downstream molecules. The autophagic regulator protein conjugate Atg5/Atg12 also inhibits MAVS signaling. Several viral proteins inhibit MAVS-mediated signals. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) from influenza A virus, for instance, may interfere with the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. MAVS is cleaved by viral proteases, including NS3/4A from hepatitis C virus and GB virus B, and 3C protein from hepatitis A virus. Cleaved MAVS does not transmit signals downstream or localize to mitochondrial membranes.",
