STING does not bind to DNA directly, and bacteria-derived cyclic di-guanylate monophosphate (c-dGMP) or cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-dAMP) were confirmed to be ligands for STING (5, 6) . Subsequently, it was found that some DNA sensors can facilitate STING activation, such as interferon gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16) (7) . However, STING activation could not be fully explained by the upstream factors/ligands that had been found. It was postulated that an unknown upstream regulator might be responsible for STING activation.",

            "text": "There are two major dsDNA-binding sites on opposite sides of the catalytic pocket: A and B site. Site A is the primary contact surface for dsDNA, whereas site B is complementary, binding another dsDNA. It allows for cGAS to the formation of a 2:2 cGAS:dsDNA complex structure directed into two orientations with dsDNA at least 20 bp (18) (19) (20) (Figure 1A) . Increased numbers of back-to-back dimers of cGAS hold the two dsDNA molecules together and permit successive recruitment of cGAS which, consequently, forms a 2n:2 cGAS:dsDNA higherordered \"ladder-like\" oligomerization, with cGAS arrayed \"head to head/tail to tail\" (19, 21) . The DNA-binding protein HU, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), or bacterial high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) can bend the dsDNA into a U-shaped structure and, thus, facilitate binding of cGAS dimers to the same strand as it travels in opposite directions (21) (Figure 1B) . Human cGAS, unlike mouse cGAS, is prone to formation of this ladder-like network with long dsDNA, because of the human-specific residues K187 and L195. These two dsDNA-interfacing residues of site A loosen the interaction of dsDNA with cGAS, leading to dsDNA curving and allowing more convenient binding for the next adjacent cGAS (20, 21) ( Figure 1C) . Finally, accumulated cGAS-dsDNA complexes can go through a liquid-phase separation and condense into gellike droplets as a reaction unit ( Figure 1D) . This conformation requires a sufficiently long dsDNA strand to form multivalent interaction positions, also requires the function of the N-terminal tail of cGAS and a recently discovered dsDNA-binding site in the catalytic domain of cGAS (site C) (22, 23) . Meanwhile, the N-terminal tail of cGAS mediates cGAS localization onto the membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PI (4, 5) P2) and prevents liberation of cGAS and oligomerization, but can release cGAS during cell stress (24). The structure of cGAS determines long strand dsDNA (>500-1,000 bp) could potentially stimulate the enzyme activity and cGAMP production of cGAS (25). The ability of human cGAS to discriminate long dsDNA strands from shorter dsDNA may contribute to the specific sensing and recognition of the \"danger DNA\" of pathogens, necrotic cells or cancer cells rather than irrelevant shorter dsDNA, thereby enhancing the immunity against them specifically.",

Intercellular gap junction consists of two docking hexamer channels formed by different connexins, which allows many small molecules, including cGAMP, to pass bi-directionally through cells. And intercellular transfer of cGAMP through gap junction is largely dependent on connexin 43 (51) (52) (53) . Additionally, cGAMP can be packaged into virons and pre-notify newly infected cells (54, 55) . Cell fusion is a distinct manner for intracellular transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); cGAMP also enter membrane-fused bystander cells in this way (56) . Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes can contain cGAMP along with viral DNA, host gDNA or mtDNA, and mediate cells communication (57, 58) . There were no evidences that cGAMP could be pumped out to extracellular space by a channel/transporter. However, it was found that SLC19A1 can transmit cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) into cell plasma (59, 60) . Notably, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (ENPP-1) can degrade extracellular cGAMP (61) (Figure 2B ). Besides triggering STING, these exogenous cGAMP can directly bind to cGAS and prompt its activation as well (62) . After binding to cGAMP, the \"lid\" region of the STING dimer undergoes a conformational change that converts STING from an inactive \"open\" formation to an active \"closed\" formation. Following that, the STING dimer translocates from the ER to perinuclear ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) vesicles, finally arriving at the Golgi to form punctuate structures with downstream molecules (2, 63) . ER-retention of STING caused by mutations results in reduced IFN signaling (64, 65) . The translocon-associated protein \u03b2 (TRAP\u03b2) recruited by inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) initially forms the TRAP translocon complex that mediates STING exit from the ER (2, 66). They both assist cytoplasmic coat protein complex-II (COPII) to drive ER-vesicle formation and carry the STING complex to the Golgi (67, 68) .",

The C-terminal tail (CTT) of STING is a linear unfolded segment, which determines the optimization of combination specificity. STING CTT in mammals tends to bind TBK1, whereas in fish it tends to activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) signal (71) . The STING phosphorylation site Ser366 in the CTT cannot reach the kinase-domain active site of its directly bound TBK1, instead can reach the kinase-domain active site of the next adjacent TBK1 binding with another STING and be phosphorylated, while TBK1 phosphorylate each other (72, 73) . Hence, STING and TBK1 can aggregate on the Golgi to form the STING signalosome. Clustering STING undergoes palmitoylation and full activation (74) . It is also possible for STING-IKK to cluster and form the STING signalosome in this manner. The STING-TBK1/IKK signalosome produces a scaffold to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or inhibitor of NF-\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1). Activated IRF3 undergo dimerization (70) . The activation of I\u03baB\u03b1 leads to its polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome, thereby eliminating its inhibition of NF-\u03baB. There is also evidence suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation might not require STING trafficking from the ER (75) . Then, the dimerized IRF3 or activated NF-\u03baB p50/p65 (p65 is also known as RelA) complex are translocated into the nucleus as transcription factors and bind to the promoter of type-I IFN to aid the transcription of type-I IFN (2, 3, 70) . Meanwhile, activation of NF-\u03baB p52/RelB can prevent recruitment of p65 and inhibit the p50/p65 signal (76) (Figure 2C ).",

It can recruit apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) by its PYHIN domain and form the AIM2 inflammasome. The inflammasome activates caspase-1, which activates IL-1 and trigger pyroptosis (97) . The AIM2 pathway could counteract the cGAS-STING pathway (98) . First, cGAS is a target for caspase-1 cleavage (99) . Second, gasdermin D activated by caspase-1 can lead to potassium ion (K + ) efflux which inhibits cGAS (100) . Conversely, the cGAS-STING pathway can trigger the AIM2 inflammasome or NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) by several means, and the process lags behind canonical IFN signaling (96, 101) . In this way, the inhibitory nucleic-acid sensor NLR family CARD domain containing 3 (NLRC3) can counteract STING by binding and occupying it, but viral DNA as a possible NLRC3 ligand can reverse its occupation of STING (102) (Figure 3A) . Another PYHIN family member, IFI16, is a DNA sensor located in the nucleus. IFI16 can bind to viral DNA sequences or damaged chromatin DNA and be translocated to the cytoplasm to recruit STING cooperatively with TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and p53 (103, 104) . Several studies have shown that IFI16 (which can stimulate the phosphorylation and recruitment of STING and TBK1) is required for the full response of STING (105, 106) ( Figure 3B) . Conversely, cGAS can partially enter the nucleus and interact with IFI16 to promote its stability (107) . Therefore, it is inferred that during viral infection, IFI16 can facilitate recognition of decapsidated viral DNA in the nucleus, while cGAS in the cytoplasm engages with viral gene transcription products (104, 108) . However, STING signaling can trigger IFI16 degradation by tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) ubiquitination (109) .",

Activation of STING enhances phosphorylation and activation of receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIP3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL). Proapoptotic BCL2 binding component 3 (PUMA), a member of BH3-only family, is subsequently activated in a RIP3/MLKL-dependent manner, which promotes leakage of mtDNA by MOMP (119, 120) . Activated IRF3 can bind directly to BAX to form IRF3/BAX complex and induce apoptosis (47) . Excessive cGAS-STING-mediated autophagy signaling can cause \"autophagic cell death\" and prevent malignant transformation of cells through DNA damage (94, 121) . STING trafficking to the lysosome can broaden permeabilization of the lysosome membrane, thereby rupturing the lysosome and releasing its contents, resulting in \"lysosomal cell death (LCD)\". LCD further triggers K + efflux and NLRP3 activation, ultimately resulting in pyroptosis (96, 101) (Figure 3D) . Moreover, stimulating STING-dependent type-I IFN and TNF\u03b1 signals simultaneously can lead to necroptosis of tumor cells (122, 123) .",

            "text": "cGAS-STING signaling has an essential role in defense against a broad spectrum of intracellular DNA and RNA viruses (9, 26, 50) . HIV is a typical RNA retrovirus: there is neither dsDNA in its genome, nor production of nucleic acids (50) . Nevertheless, cGAS can detect the presence of HIV. RNA:DNA hybrids synthesized during reverse transcription that can be sensed by cGAS explain (at least in part) this phenomenon (14) . cGAS may be triggered by endogenous DNA broken and released during HIV infection as well theoretically. However, some studies found the new mechanisms. The early reverse-transcription production of HIV-1 can flank short stem loops with paired base, which lead to the production of Y-type DNA containing unpaired guanosines that can activate cGAS well (15) . Moreover, nucleolus protein non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), as a sensor of capsid components of HIV, can help cGAS to be translocated to the nucleus and assist cGAS to sense HIV DNA accompanied by polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) (136, 137) . The assistance proffered by NONO in assisting cGAS to sense DNA is also associated with its role in constructing a ribonuclear complex with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) subunits around hexamethylene bisacetamide-inducible protein1 (HEXIM1), termed as \"HEXIM1-DNA-PK -paraspeckle components-ribonuclear protein complex (HDP-RNP), \" which also has a role in repair of DNA damage and transduction of genotoxic signals (138) . This complex is also required to accompany cGAS-PQBP1 in sensing DNA virus, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (139) . In addition, during virus infection, STING activation can lead to global suppression of translation in cells, which restricts viral replication (140) .",

As a result, HIV-2 can cross-protect against HIV-1 (141). This phenomenon has been attributed to the fact that HIV-2 (instead of HIV-1) can encode protein Vpx, which overcomes the SAMHD1 restriction of dNTP in DCs (46, 142) . HIV-1 can infect DCs via Vpx presentation, nevertheless, HIV-1 still cannot be fully sensed and induce an efficient immune response owing to certain escape mechanisms. Whether it is HIV-1 or HIV-2, a completely robust IFN response is required at pre-and post-integration sensing stages (143) . cGAS in DCs can detect reverse-transcribed cDNA of HIV-2 before and after integration, whereas HIV-1 sensing is after genome integration owing to its capsid protection (144, 145) . It was suggested that during initial infection by HIV-1, nucleotides are recruited into the intact capsid through the hexamer pores on the HIV-1 capsid. Therefore, the capsid-coated HIV-1 virus prevents the encapsidated reverse-transcription production from being sensed by the cytosolic nucleic-acid sensors (146) . HIV-1 capsids can be ubiquitinated and then degraded by the host E3 ubiquitin ligase function of TRIM5, which leads to detection of viral DNA, meanwhile HIV-1 could use some host protein like cyclophilins to evade the sensing (147, 148) (Figure 2A) .",

CDNs (e.g., c-dGMP, c-dAMP, and cGAMP) produced by bacteria are essential for the regulation of bacterial function, such as biofilm formation, colonization, and reproduction (149, 150) . As ligands for STING, CDNs can bind directly to and activate STING independently of cGAS, which contributes to several immune responses from bacteria (151) . Usually, bacteria can enter or be engulfed by the cell through the endophagosome and be sequestered from the cytosolic sense receptor. Some bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), can survive in vacuoles, resulting in an insufficient cellular immune response to defend against it (152) . In contrast, the ESX-1 secretion system of the mycobacterium can translocate the phagosomal vacuolar matrix including bacterial genome molecules into the cytoplasm and trigger the cGAS-sensing pathway (153) . For other bacteria, such as Legionella pneumophila or and Brucella abortus, the host guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) facilitate rupture of phagosome vacuoles and are indispensable for controlling their infection (154, 155) . Autophagy signaling mediated by cGAS/STING is also involved in microorganism clearance mentioned above (90, 91) . Bacteria have evolved strategies to confront this pathway too. Bacterial phosphodiesterase CdnP produced by Mtb or group-B streptococci can degrade CDNs (156, 157) . CpsA (a type of Mtb LytR-CpsA-Psr domain-containing protein) can prevent autophagy responses for eliminating pathogens (90) . Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion membrane proteins can maintain the stability of the inclusion membrane and avoid inclusion lysis (leading to pathogen antigens leaking out and being detected by the host cell) (158, 159) . Yersinia outer protein J (YopJ) deubiquitinates STING and impedes the formation of the STING signalosome (160) . The cGAS-STING pathway activation even impedes the elimination of Listeria monocytogenes because bacterial DNA can be packaged into EVs and transferred into T cells, where it induces apoptosis of T cells (161, 162) .",

            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a representative model for elucidating the mechanism of type-I interferonopathies. In SLE, the level of self-DNA which is packaged into apoptosis-derived membrane vesicles along with the level of anti-dsDNA antibody is increased in the serum of patients (174) . A study revealed increasing levels of ISGs (including cGAS/STING) as well as the cGAMP-detected ratio in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells of SLE patients (175) . As innate immune cells, DCs have essential roles in antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, and priming the adaptive response of immune cells (176) . Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) can internalize and recognize self-DNA and they are the main source of type-I IFN in serum during SLE (177) . IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is essential for complete function of immature pDCs (178) . IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IL-1 can induce mitochondrial oxidative stress in DCs and decrease ATP production, which blocks proton-pump function and increases pH of lysosomes. This process inhibits mitochondrial degradation and blocks mtDNA clearance, which engages the cGAS-STING pathway (31, 179). Moreover, monocytes may sense mtDNA through cGAS-STING and differentiate into DCs (31, 180). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are complexes released by neutrophils exposed to stimuli or autoantibody immune complexes. NETs comprise extracellularly released chromatin, myeloperoxidase enzymes, and also oxidized mtDNA. In lupus-like diseases, NETs can be induced by IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and may play a major part in priming pDCs (181, 182) . All mechanisms stated above contribute to a more aggravated type-IIFN response and exacerbate disease. A similar phenomenon can be observed in SAVI, ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Artemis deficiency (183) . However, compared with SAVI, DCs in SLE can prime T-cell maturation significantly and increasing secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 can also lead to activation of adaptive immunity ( Figure 4A) .",

With regard to ischemic myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac macrophages can sense dying ruptured cells and lead to fatal post-MI cardiac inflammation, which is reversed by ablation of cGAS/STING/IRF3 (184, 185) . In a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model induced by a methionine-and choline-deficient or high-fat diet, lipotoxicity can cause mitochondrial damage and up-regulate STING/IRF3 expression in hepatocytes, which in turn promotes lipid accumulation and inhibits glycogen synthesis. All above bring out hepatic inflammation and hepatocytes apoptosis (186) . In this model, mice with deficiency of STING presents alleviated insulin resistance and lower levels of low-density lipoprotein in serum, and also decreased hepatic inflammation and fibrosis/steatosis, in which hepatic macrophages/kupffer cells may take a big part (187, 188) . Lipotoxicity can induce p62 to be phosphorylated through the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway, which causes aggravated protein inclusions in hepatocytes and it indicates that p62 could be a biomarker for NASH prognosis (189) . mtDNA-dependent inflammation induced by lipotoxicity also occurs in adipose tissue and endothelial cells of blood vessels, which contributes to tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular diseases (42, 190) . In traumatic brain injury (TBI), local injury initiates breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and global neuroinflammation (191) . STING expression is up-regulated in TBI and can lead to increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enlargement of secondary injury (192) . Reduced autophagy-associated protein expression induced by STING may contribute to the dysfunction of autophagy and dampen the elimination of necrotic tissue, thereby intensifying inflammation (192) . During silicosis, silica can yield cytosolic dsDNA release and engage cGAS-STING, which activates DCs and macrophages to cause severe lung inflammation. It also leads to death of epithelial cells through the NLRP3 pathway and pulmonary fibrosis (193) . Similarly, mtDNA release in renal tubule cells has been found to be associated with acute kidney injury by cytotoxic drugs and chronic renal fibrosis (194, 195) .",

In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia is considered to be the main source of cGAS-STING-dependent IFN expression (197) . In neurodegenerative diseases, levels of the marker of microglia activation-cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), and pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased (198) . A significant feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the neuronal loss of cerebral nuclei (especially dopaminergic neurons in the substantianigra). Serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1 and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin are ubiquitinrelated factors that take part in removing damaged mitochondria by autophagy, and their dysfunction lead to the early onset of PD (199) . Parkin \u2212/\u2212 and PINK1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, following exhaustive exercise, show inflammation and loss of dopaminergic neurons, which can be rescued by loss of STING (200) . Similarly, AT is a genetic disease caused by missense mutation of a DNA-repair protein: ATM. AT patients usually show neurodegenerative defects (especially ataxia) complicated with telangiectasia on their eyes or body, deficiency of adaptive immune cells, and predisposition to cancer (201) . Nevertheless, up-regulation of expression of type-I IFN can also be found in AT patients and mice, causing them to be prone to autoimmune diseases (36, 183, 202) . This syndrome is related to p53-mediated senescence but also the chronic inflammation mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway which engages cytosolic uncombined broken gDNA caused by ATM dysfunction (127) . In addition, accumulation of cellular mtDNA occurs in age-related macular degeneration characterized by retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) degeneration. This can trigger chronic inflammation by cGAS-STING pathway, in which NLRP3 inflammasomes, inflammatory/apoptotic caspases are also involved (203, 204) .",

MS is characterized by over-reactive microglia, infiltration of self-reactive T cells, demyelization of nerve fibers and hyperplasia of gliocytes. Autoantibodies against proteins expressed in immune-privileged regions of CNS also contribute to its pathogenesis (205) . In MS, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 can attenuate disease severity effectively. This implies a protective role for type-I IFN in CNS, which is considered to counteract the pro-inflammatory IFN\u03b3 (206) . Using experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) as a MS model, STING was found to be indispensable for amelioration of type-I IFNmediated neuroinflammation, and it could be induced by a conventional anti-viral drug ganciclovir (207) . Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a factor inversely related to the morbidity of MS (208) . It was found that UV-B irradiation can recruit inflammatory monocytes and produce type-I IFN in a STING-dependent manner (209) . All above indicate that cGAS-STING-IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway may have a beneficial effect on some CNS inflammatory diseases such as MS.",

Trp withdrawal or Trpoxidative catabolites can interact with general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) and mTOR, of which both can control cellular aminoacid metabolism and suppress T helper 1 (T h 1) cells immunity (210) . IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is a potent IDO inducer to suppress proliferation of CD4 + T h 1 cells and promote differentiation of Foxp3 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells, which are believed to suppress CNSspecific autoimmunity (210, 211) . In addition, DNA released from dying cells can be internalized directly by T cells and sensed by cGAS-STING pathway, which leads to enhancement of the T h 2 transcription factor GATA3 but suppression of the T h 1 transcription factor T-bet. Consequently, this process polarizes naive T cells toward T h 2 differentiation (212). Studies mentioned above may (at least in part) explain why the cGAS-STING signal is a negative regulator of MS.",

In some subtypes of SAVI and mouse models, apoptosis of blood-vessel endothelial cells or bronchial epithelial cells and leucopenia can be observed (especially T-cell lymphopenia) (166, 169, 170) . When the STING signal is stimulated, apoptosis occurs more frequently in normal or cancerous T cells (119) . Also, bone-marrow chimeras and gene-knockout studies have shown that T cells defect in SAVI are not associated with type-I IFN signaling or cGAS (213, 214) . Localization of STING at the Golgi can cause delay of T-cell mitosis and reduced proliferation independently of IRF3 and TBK1 (215) . Furthermore, a \"UPR motif \" on the C-terminus of STING can cause ER stress and UPR, resulting in Ca 2+ overloading and T-cell death (82) . A controversial view is that B cells express STING variously and may undergo apoptosis through this way (166, 216, 217) . However, simultaneous signaling by STING and the B-cell antigen receptor can promote B-cell activation and antibody production independently of type-I IFN (217) (Figure 4B) .",

A mechanism is many cancer cells expressing cGAS can recognize cytosolic DNA and produce cGAMP to stimulate secretion of type-I IFN through STING (228, 229) . Excessive expression of TREX1 in cancer cells, which can be induced by radiotherapy, attenuates this progression (228) . cGAS-STING can also promote senescence of cancer cells through the p53-p21 pathway (129) . cGAS-STING-mediated autophagy contributes to autophagic cell death if mitotic crisis occurs to avoid transformation of cancer cells (121) . Melanoma cells can also transfer cGAMP produced by them to proximal non-cancerous host cells through gap-junction channels and activate STING in these cells, which contributes to the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells (51, 230) . Expression of the NK cellspecific ligand NKG2D retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAE1) on cancer cells is highly up-regulated by STING once NK cells permeate into tumor tissue (231) .

When DSBs occur in cancer cells, cGAS can be relocated to the nucleus and obstruct the formation of the PARP1-Timeless complex, thereby inhibiting homologous recombination repair and maintaining CIN, which potentiates tumor evolution (35, 223) . It has also been reported that cGAS recognizing CIN activates non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling and potentiates cellular metastasis programs (247) . Furthermore, STING \u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to skin carcinogenesis in a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-treatment model. It has been demonstrated that when DMBA-induced nuclear DNA leaks into the cytoplasm, STING can induce chronic inflammatory stimulation that contributes to cancer development (248) . During brain metastasis, cGAMP transferred to bystander cells (e.g., astrocytes) can also produce IFN\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1 in the TME but, in this context, it will support tumor development and chemoresistance (249) . Coordinating with myeloid cells penetrating into the tumor, myeloidderived suppressor cells can also be recruited through the C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) (250) .

For example, blockade of CD47-signal regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1) signaling on DCs can activate NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and increase the pH in phagosomes along with incomplete degradation of mtDNA, which can trigger cGAS-STING (129) . STING deficiency in mice abrogates the anti-tumor effect of CD47 blockade (258) . A similar phenomenon also can be seen in anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) therapy (259) . There is greater infiltration of IFN\u03b3 + cells and CD8 + T cells and PD-1/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in TME treated by STING-ligand derivatives (260) . Therefore, in several types of tumors, combined administration of a STING agonist and immune-checkpoint antibody could elicit a more curative outcome compared with one therapy alone (238, 261) .",

Some artificial analog molecules of CDNs, such as 5,6dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) and 10-carboxymethyl-9 (10H) acridone (CMA) can bind the CDN pocket of mouse-specific STING dimers and promote conformational transition of STING from inactive \"open\" to an active \"closed\" state (263, 264) . DMXAA showed convincing efficacy in restraining tumors in mice (265) . However, DMXAA is restricted in activating mouse-specific STING but not humanspecific STING, which could be an explanation for the failure of DMXAA in treating 1299 non-small-cell lung cancer patients in a phase-III clinical trial (NCT00662597) (266) . Nonetheless, with three substitutions (G230I, Q266I, and S162A), human STING can also be induced by DMXAA to undergo conformational transition (264) .

In general, cGAS-STING-type-I IFN signaling can promote the innate immune response in myeloid cells but alleviate the adaptive immune response exerted by T cells and B cells. cGAS shows high expression in APCs such as macrophages and DCs, but STING is expressed in most cells (10) . cGAS-STING signaling corresponding to cytoplasmic dsDNA in APCs can boost innate and adaptive immunity transiently. In this situation, the DNA challenge signal is limited to only macrophages and DCs. Their pro-inflammatory and antigenpresenting functions to adaptive immune cells are promoted in the short-term. If the signal spreads to other bystander cells, such as T cells, B cells, local resident cells by means of cGAMP transfer, or just aberrant STING activation by GOF, it causes apoptosis in bystander cells or adaptive immune cells and immune tolerance in the long-term. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the intrinsic function of the cGAS-STING pathway is essential for the innate immune system responses of the host immediately after pathogen invasion or abnormal cell appearing. Once the challenge persists, the cGAS-STING pathway controls the adaptive immune system to avoid chronic, detrimental inflammatory reactions or autoimmune diseases.",

In this scheme, the antitumor immune response is enhanced while avoiding apoptosis of adaptive immune cells and infiltration of immune suppressor cells. Also, most research on the cGAS-STING pathway has focused on its IFN-expressing role but overlooked autophagy and cell-death roles, which are also main downstream signaling of the pathway.

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) can be stimulated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), agonist compounds and mutants. (A) STING activation in dendritic cells (DCs). When exposed to type-I interferon (IFN), neutrophils can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). DCs can internalize self-DNA and trigger the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway to secrete type-I IFN, which activates DC maturation. Type-I IFN in turn induces mitochondrial stress and decreases ATP production that increases the pH of lysosomes. Incomplete degradation of mitochondria leads to accumulation of mtDNA in the cytosol and activates STING. Mature DCs can present antigen and co-activate signaling to prime T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. (B) STING activation in T cells. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 enhances differentiation of T helper 2 (T h 2) cells but suppresses differentiation of T h 1 cells. Activation of STING can induce mitotic delay and unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to reduced proliferation and promotion of apoptosis. All of the actions stated above suppress the functions of T h 1 cells and lead to suppression of adaptive immune responses (Red arrows represent mechanisms limiting cellular immune responses, and black arrows represent mechanisms promoting cellular immune responses).",

Double-stranded breaks (DSBs) can lead to cytosolic self-DNA that engages the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and produces type-I interferon (IFN). STING promotes the senescence of cancer cells. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) can transfer to proximal host non-cancer cells through gap-junction channels and promote the formation of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main source of type-I IFN and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and promote an inflammatory TME. Infiltrating DCs take up tumor-derived DNA or cGAMP from dying cell fragments or exosomes. DCs cross-prime and activate anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + T cells and constrict cancer growth effectively. Co-stimulation of type-I IFN and TNF\u03b1 signaling simultaneously leads to remarkable necroptosis of tumor cells. cGAS can relocate to the nucleus and obstruct polymerase 1 (PARP1), which suppresses DNA repair. Chronic levels of IFN\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1 in TME could support tumor development and cause type-2 macrophages and regulatory T cells to be recruited (Red arrows represent mechanisms promoting tumors; black arrows represent mechanisms limiting tumors).",

Increased membrane permeability allows endolysosomal pathogenic DNA release into the cytosol. Viruses can release virons into the cytosol. The hexamer pore facilitates movement of nucleotides into the capsid. The latter can also be ubiquitinated and degraded. (2) Intrinsic DNA source: self-DNA from the nucleus with dysfunctional chromatin proteins can lead to chromatin DNA injury and gDNA presenting in the cytoplasm. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) induced by mitochondrial stress can release oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). (3) Three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), DNase II, SAM domain, HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) and RNaseH2 can restrict cytosolic DNA and DNA/RNA hybrids. cGAMP can be hydrolyzed by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (ENPP1).
