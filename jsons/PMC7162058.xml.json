In lytic infection, VP16 activates transcription of the immediate\u2010early genes and results in a cascade of gene transcription, in which early genes and late genes are transcribed in an ordered temporal pattern.\n18\n Because of its ability to transactivate expression of viral immediate\u2010early genes, VP16 is considered to be essential for efficient viral replication.\n19\n, \n20\n DNA polymerase is another key enzyme in the replication of all herpesviruses.\n21\n Most drugs available to treat herpesvirus infections target the viral DNA polymerase. In our experiments, we showed that the siRNA duplexes targeting VP16 and DNA polymerase genes potently inhibited HSV\u20101 replication.
