A recent study revealed that more than 300 human genes are required for replication of WNV and the closely related flavivirus, Dengue virus (Krishnan et al., 2008). In addition to replication, we anticipate that many other human genes are needed for assembly and secretion of nascent WNV virions. Rather than conducting genome-wide screens to identify host factors that are involved in WNV biology, we focused on cellular proteins that interact with the capsid protein. In addition to performing a critical structural role in virus assembly, our data indicate that interactions between this viral protein and the milieu of host proteins may contribute to pathogenesis (Hunt et al., 2007, van Marle et al., 2007). As well as potentially functioning in a negative capacity at the virus-host interface, interaction of WNV capsid with host proteins may be required for replication and/or virus assembly. With respect to the latter, we recently identified the nucleolar helicase DDX56 as a WNV capsid-binding protein (Xu et al., 2011).",

Indeed, evidence suggests that some RNA helicases are required for replication of viral RNA whereas others are needed for assembly of infectious virus particles. In addition to serving as co-factors during virus replication and assembly, the mechanism by which a given helicase functions in these processes may vary considerably. Moreover, in some cases the enzymatic activity of a helicase may not even be required for its role in the infection pathway. For example, the helicase activity of the NS3 protein is dispensable for its function assembly of infectious yellow fever virions (Patkar and Kuhn, 2008).",

In addition to creating D166N and E167Q mutations in DDX56, silent mutations were introduced downstream of the DEAD box motif in an shRNA target site (\nFig. 1).

Immunoblot analyses show that compared to expression in non-silencing (NS) cells, the level of wild type myc-tagged DDX56 (WT-RNAi-S) in DDX56 knockdown cells was just on the threshold of detection with the anti-myc antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 9).

At 48 h post-infection, cell lysates and supernatants were subjected to immunoblot analyses and plaque assays, respectively. The immunoblot in\nFig. 4A shows that based on AcGFP expression, similar levels of transduction efficiency were achieved for all of the DDX56 constructs. As expected, only the RNAi-resistant forms of DDX56 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-myc. In agreement with a recent report from our laboratory (Xu et al., 2011), titers of WNV from DDX56 depleted cells were reduced more than 100 fold compared to those from non-silencing controls (Fig. 4B). However, infection of cells expressing RNAi-resistant DDX56 resulted in normal viral titers, which were well over 1\u00d7108\n pfu/ml. In contrast, infection of cells expressing RNAi-sensitive DDX56 or DEAD box mutants produced viral titers that were similar to DDX56 knockdown cells that had been transduced with a lentivirus encoding AcGFP only. Capsid protein was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with D166N and E167Q mutants (Fig. 4C) and thus the failure of these DEAD box mutants to complement the production of infectious WNV virions was not due to an inability to bind capsid. Despite the large decrease (>100-fold) in viral titers, expression of DEAD box mutants did not interfere with replication of WNV. This conclusion is based on the observation that levels of WNV capsid protein were normal in these cells (Fig. 4A).",

To establish whether the helicase activity of DDX56 is important for this process, we assayed the relative amounts of genomic RNA in WNV particles secreted from cells expressing D166N and E167Q mutants. Loss of DDX56 helicase activity did not affect expression of WNV capsid protein (Fig. 4A) nor its secretion from infected cells in the form of virus particles (\nFig. 5A). To determine if packaging of viral RNA was affected, total RNA was extracted from WNV particles and the relative amounts of genomic RNA (normalized to capsid protein) were determined by RT-PCR. Data in Fig. 5B show that virus particles isolated from infected cells expressing helicase dead mutants D166N and E167Q contained 3\u20134 times less genomic RNA than those isolated from non-silencing cells or cells expressing RNAi-resistant wild type DDX56. These data indicate that the enzymatic activity of DDX56 is important for packaging genomic RNA into WNV virions.",

If this is indeed the case, blocking interaction between capsid and DDX56 should also reduce the yield of infectious WNV. Our approach was to over-express the capsid-binding region of DDX56 in order to prevent interaction of endogenous DDX56 with capsid. To identify the region of DDX56 that binds to capsid, myc-tagged constructs encoding the N- and C-terminal regions of DDX56 were co-expressed with WNV capsid in transfected cells followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Data in\nFig. 6 show that in transfected or infected cells, the WNV capsid does not bind to the DEAD box helicase-containing region of DDX56 (DDX56-NT-myc), but rather, the C-terminal part of the protein, which was produced in cells expressing DDX56-CT-myc. This region of DDX56 also contains the targeting information that is required for localization to the nucleolus (\nFig. 7).",

Data in\nFig. 8A show that expression of full length, N- or C-terminal regions of DDX56 do not affect viral gene expression based on the observation that similar levels of capsid protein were detected in all of the infected cell lysates. However, expression of DDX56-CT-myc reduced viral titers approximately 50-fold compared to expression of full length DDX56-myc or NT-DDX56-myc (Fig. 8B). While these results suggest that interaction between WNV capsid and DDX56 is important for a post-replication step in the WNV infection cycle, assembly and secretion of WNV particles was not affected (Fig. 8C).

While there have been notable successes using this approach, it suffers from a number of limitations. First, viruses almost invariably develop resistance to these types of drugs. This is particularly true of RNA viruses whose polymerases do not possess proof reading activity and are therefore by nature, error prone and mutable. Second, the choice of targets is very limited due to the small number of enzymes encoded by most viruses. In contrast, targeting host factors as means to control viral infection is a burgeoning area that has shown promise, particularly for flaviviruses. Replication and assembly of infectious flavivirus particles requires hundreds of host genes (Krishnan et al., 2008). Accordingly, it may be possible to target a variety of host proteins, particularly enzymes, as a means to control viral infection. Although this approach may also have drawbacks, viral resistance to small molecules that block host enzymes should be minimal.",

Among the helicase superfamily, DEAD box proteins form the largest group of these enzymes. These helicases are thought to play multiple roles in RNA metabolism including mRNA splicing and transport, transcription, translation and remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes. In most cases, the physiological substrates of DEAD box helicases have not been defined but it is clear that a number of pathogenic RNA viruses require these enzymes for replication and/or assembly. For example, at least two cellular helicases, DDX1 and DDX3 function as cofactors that promote replication of HIV (Fang et al., 2004, Yedavalli et al., 2004). DDX1 and DDX3 both appear to facilitate export of HIV RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through interaction with Rev. DDX1 also stimulates replication of coronavirus RNA (Xu et al., 2010). However, because coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, it would appear that the role DDX1 plays in replication of these large RNA viruses is distinct from its function as a cofactor for HIV.",

Many of these enzymes likely function in replication of viral RNA however recent evidence suggests that helicases are needed for efficient virus assembly too. For example, we recently determined that the nucleolar helicase DDX56 is needed for a critical post-replication step in WNV morphogenesis (Xu et al., 2011). DDX56 appears to function in assembly of pre-ribosomal particles, but it is not associated with mature ribosomes (Zirwes et al., 2000). By analogy, it is tempting to speculate that DDX56 functions similarly in assembly of other large ribonucleoprotein particles such as viral nucleocapsids. The fact that DDX56 is not detected in mature WNV virions (Xu et al., 2011) is consistent with this scenario. A related study by another laboratory revealed that DDX24 performs a similar function during assembly of HIV virions (Ma et al., 2008).",

Rather than using RNAi to down-regulate expression of DDX56 in cells, it would be advantageous to use small molecule inhibitors that target the enzymatic activity of this protein. If this is to be a feasible approach, it was important to demonstrate that the helicase activity of DDX56 is in fact required for its role in WNV infectivity. While this may seem intuitive, the enzymatic function of a \u201chelicase\u201d is not always required for its role in virus biology. Indeed, among highly related viral helicases, the mode of action during virus assembly can vary greatly. For example, assembly of infectious Kunjin virus, a close relative of WNV, requires expression of the viral NS3 protein in cis (Liu et al., 2002). In contrast, during assembly of yellow fever virus particles, the helicase activity of NS3 is not required for this process (Patkar and Kuhn, 2008). Moreover, yellow fever virus NS3 can perform its virus assembly function when expressed in trans unlike Kunjin virus NS3 which must be expressed in cis.",

Through an unknown mechanism, WNV infection causes relocalization of DDX56 from the nucleolus to cytoplasmic structures that are enriched in capsid protein (Xu et al., 2011). It is likely that these capsid-positive cytoplasmic elements are virus assembly sites on the endoplasmic reticulum. Next, it will be of interest to develop small molecule inhibitors that can be used to target the helicase activity of DDX56. These inhibitors would not be expected to block replication of WNV, but by reducing the infectivity of nascent virions, viral spread would be minimized thereby allowing the immune system to contain the infection.",

The crude virion preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses with rabbit anti-capsid antibody. The relative amounts of capsid from three independent experiments were quantitated (A). (D) Levels of viral genomic RNA in the virions were determined by RT-PCR. The average relative levels of viral RNA (normalized to capsid protein) from three independent experiments (each conducted in triplicate) were quantitated. Bars indicate standard error values.",
