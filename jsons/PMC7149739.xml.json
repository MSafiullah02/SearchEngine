At Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and North American airports, however, significantly higher shares in excess of 45% have been generated. The gradual erosion of commercial revenues across Europe is attributed to competition from online retail (\u201cAmazonation\u201d) and off-site parking options/ride-hailing apps (mainly Uber and Lyft) as well as changing consumer behavior in a mature market (Davitt, 2015; Steer Davies Gleave, SDG, 2017; Vogel, B. and Cross, 2017). Together, they make up for roughly one-half of the nonaeronautical revenue across Europe and on global average. Notwithstanding, from a historical perspective, it was the European region driving toward commercialization and a whole new look at airports\u2014and eventually privatization. This is why specifically European airports had frequently been referred to as \u201cshopping mall plus runway.\u201d Recent data gives evidence, however, that duty-free and travel retail is increasingly under pressure despite rising passenger numbers. More and more airport operators around the world are facing this dilemma, indicating that the heydays may be over (Butterworth-Hayes, 2017, Beltran, 2018, Rozario, 2017).",

            "text": "On the medium-term average, the percentage of aeronautical revenue in relation to total costs is only sufficient to cover the operating expenses but not the capital costs in terms of interest charges and depreciation of assets\u2014above all airside infrastructure such as runways and terminal facilities. Exceptions are Middle East airports, where aeronautical revenue is not even sufficient to make up for operating expenditure, and African airports, where the total cost (including capital cost) is being excelled (102%). This appears to be a rare exception, related to the very high 69% share of aeronautical income in contrast to undersized revenue from commercial activities as displayed in Fig. 5.7. In general, however, growing commercial revenue appears to be a prerequisite for the airports\u2019 ability to modernize and expand to accommodate future traffic volumes.Feature 5.1Aviation policyThis feature exemplifies potential effects of aviation policy by focusing on selected aspects of European legislation. The main attention is centered on regional airports. Due to their significant importance for the economic development of a region, airports have frequently been subject to political activities. Due to predominantly public ownership, politicians may also be tempted to capitalize on the integration of airports into the socioeconomic engine with considerable effects for regional employment and other social benefits.In Europe, the European Commission (EC)\u2014in its capacity as an economic regulator and competition authority\u2014has come up with several Directives and Regulations to create a level playing field for airlines and a more efficient use of scarce airport capacities to the benefit of the traveling public. Fig. 5.11\ngives an overview of the thresholds aiming to ensure an adequate treatment of regional airports. While regional is not clearly defined, it essentially refers to\nsmaller airports primarily serving short and medium range routes and/or point-to-point destinations. It should be noted that several pieces of legislation are currently being reviewed.As listed under section \u201cEconomics\u201d in Fig. 5.11, the EC also became active again in the area of state aid for airports and airlines. Small remote airports had attracted attention of politicians in the member countries in their pursuit to foster regional development and employment. This resulted in the development of publicly funded regional airports, many of which were and still are not financially viable. Frequently dependent on one or few LCCs, such publicly\u2014also partially EU-funded airport infrastructures\u2014turned out to be not sustainable and poor value for money (European Court of Auditors, ECA, 2014).Against this background, the EC adapted its (at the time) new Guidelines on State Aid to Airports and Airlines in 2014 (EC, 2014), replacing the Community Guidelines of 2005 on the financing of airports and start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports. The new Aviation Guidelines were revised as part of the Commission\u2019s state aid modernization strategy in order to harmonize the legal principles applying to state aid and with a view to ensuring fair competition between airlines and regional airports. They were based on the view that there are too many nonviable regional airports in the European Union. It minimizes the general interest objectives of these airports: economic and regional development, accessibility, tourism, etc. (Lepi\u00e8ce, 2014).The new rules essentially mean that airports will not be granted financial aid for operations and investments after a transitional period of the next 10 years. During this transitional phase, the state is only permitted to channel operation subsidies or investment subsidies to those airports, which are classified as eligible, meeting the tightened requirements and conditions for approval. In order to facilitate the transition to a complete application of state aid rules to airports, the Commission intends to allow a flexible approach during a 10-year period. In 2024, airports will then have to manage their business without any state subsidies for operation or investments (Lepi\u00e8ce, 2014).As the Commission sets out to improve efficiency and profitability, it will prevent airports exceeding 5 mppa from receiving state aid. Those handling less than 3 mppa will see their operating aid phased out during the transition period. Airports below 0.7 mppa will still be entitled to 80% of existing grants but face an uncertain future, since the EC intends to revisit the issue in 5 years\u2019 time (Clark, 2014, Reals, 2014). Table 5.5\nillustrates which member states\u2019 airports are subject to the new guidelines.\nThe new regulations are expected to affect a number of airports across Europe, and eventually drive them out of business, as it is unrealistic to assume that most regional airports can become profitable within the next 10 years (Clark, 2014, Osborne and Flottau, 2014). Extreme pressure was exerted on smaller airports owned by cities or regional governments as, for example, German Zweibruecken (ZXW) and Altenburg\u2013Nobitz (AOC) or Charleroi (CRL) in Belgium. In these cases, the EC concluded that they had received state aid which was not compatible with EU rules and needed to be recovered.Public authorities are allowed to grant support where justified, particularly for improving accessibility of a region and/or significantly contributing to its economic development. I contrast to that, the duplication of unprofitable airport infrastructure or undue favoring of certain airlines is considered to be a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money and a distortion of competition in the single market. By the same reasoning state aid granted to Frankfurt\u2013Hahn (HHN) and Saarbruecken (SCN) in Germany, Alghero (AHO) in Italy, and Vasteras (VST) in Sweden received full approval (European Commission (EC), 2018b, Deutsche Bank, 2015).Ever since the Commission ordered governments to claw back millions of euros in illegal subsidies given to airports and airlines. In November 2016, it ordered Ryanair, Hapag-Lloyd Express, and Tuifly to repay EUR 10.7m (USD 12m) for illegally subsidized costs at Klagenfurt airport in Austria (Toplensky, 2017).In May 2017, the EC simplified the 2014 state aid regime, including rules for public investment in airports. In striving to focus on measures of biggest impact on competition, it extended the scope of the \u201cGeneral Block Exemption Regulation\u201d to (ports) and airports. This will enable Member States to implement a wide range of state aid measures without prior approval by the Commission. This essentially means that:\u2022public investments in regional airports <3 mppa are now legally possible without prior control (applicable to 420 or 80% of airports across the EU handling about 13% of total traffic), and\u2022public authorities may cover operating costs of small airports <200,000 ppa (applicable to almost 50% of EU airports handling only 0.75% of total traffic).\nThe Commission further justified the changes because it found that similar past investments did not negatively impact on the Internal Market or competition. Aid to reduce operating costs at any larger airports still constitutes illegal state aid (European Commission (EC), 2017, Toplensky, 2017).Two pending issues in the field of European aviation policy are the capacity crunch and Brexit. The first one has partially been addressed by the European (Juncker) Commission as part of its \u201cNew Aviation Strategy for Europe\u201d as of December 2015 (EC, 2015). It is supposed to foster innovation and generate growth for European business, while letting passengers benefit from increasing connectivity and safer, cleaner as well as cheaper flights. This includes various activities in the following four main areas:\u2022pursuing an ambitious EU external aviation policy,\u2022tackling limits to growth (including airport services, capacity, and Single European Sky, SES),\u2022maintaining high EU standards, and\u2022innovation and digital technologies.\nBeing effective for close to 3 years, it remains to be seen in how far the new strategy will contribute to the provision of adequate capacity in the air and on the ground, thus preventing a growing number of Europe\u2019s airports to be fully congested.The second subject matter is equally challenging: while Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union on March 31, 2019 is rapidly approaching, many of the uncertainties regarding aviation remain. It is questionable whether the United Kingdom will continue to enjoy the privileges of the Single Aviation Market in terms of future traffic rights and an envisioned transition agreement to buy more time is nowhere in sight. Airbus published its risk assessment in June 2018 and is reconsidering its local engagement and investment, due to British government\u2019s slow progress in areas such as customs, border controls, trade agreements, and access to European regulators. It concluded that any form of Brexit\u2014be it harder or softer\u2014will be damaging to the country. This view is being shared by aerospace manufacturers and airlines alike. Manufacturers are concerned about the security of their supply chains, while airlines are worried if they can continue flying their routes (Osborne and Flottau, 2018a, Osborne and Flottau, 2018b).The meaning of a no-deal scenario for market access and airline ownership and control is hardly more than speculation\u2014the same holds true regarding the implications for airports. As of July 2018, the EC maintains that most flights will cease since the UK certificates issued to EU airlines would no longer be valid, neither would EU-issued licenses for UK-based airlines (Saeed, 2018).\n",
