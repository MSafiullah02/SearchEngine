            "text": "In April 2009, the novel pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified in Mexico and quickly spread throughout the world with extensive morbidity and unacceptable mortality rates.1 The influenza virus presents a global health threat, associated with a high risk of severe complications since the virus circulates not only within but also between numerous host populations. The virus is transmitted mainly through coughing, sneezing, and close bodily contact. Thus far, vaccination is the major resolution strategy to control seasonal influenza viral pandemics. At present, two major classes of antiviral drugs, oseltamivir and amantadine, are commonly used as the prophylaxis and for the treatment of influenza virus infection.2 Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, inhibits the spread of the virus and the release of virus progeny from infected cells. While amantadine blocks the M2 protein in order to inhibit viral uncoating from the infected cells. These drugs target on a highly variable sequence, as a consequence, the virus can easily acquire resistance by mutating the drug targets. Recently, increasing resistance of influenza A viruses to amantadine and oseltamivir has been reported.3 The discovery of new and effective drugs for preventing and/or treating influenza infections is a crucial challenge for the global medical community.",

As reported,5, 6, 7, 8 TS extracts have been used to treat various diseases and have been shown to have a variety of effects, including glycemic control, inhibition of lipid accumulation, antimicrobial activity and anti-cancer. Many compounds, including retinoids, catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, methyl gallate, quercetin, afzelin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, and rutin have been isolated from the leaves of TS.6 According to our previous study, TSL-1 has been verified to inhibit attachment activity towards pandemic influenza A (H1N1) through down-regulation of adhesion molecules to prevent virus infection.9 As of yet, it is unclear which major compounds in TSL-1 execute the anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate those chemical compounds present in TSL-1, including catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin, to examine the inhibition of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus replication in a cell model. Herein, we have further characterized the anti-influenza viral activities of two major compounds present in TSL-1, catechin and gallic acid.",

Viruses were harvested at 72 h post-infection using a process through three cycles of freezing and thawing, and clarified by low speed centrifugation (500 g for 10 min). Virus yields in the culture supernatants were assayed by the standard plaque assay in MDCK cells to determine the actual infectious viral titer. Briefly, confluent monolayer MDCK cells cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate (2 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2) were infected with the supernatants. After 60 min for virus incubation, the inoculums were removed and replaced with overlaying medium (MEM containing 2 \u03bcg/ml trypsin, 5% low melting agarose, without serum) that contained TSL-1 or chemical compounds at different concentrations.

Amantadine (10 \u03bcg/mL) was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1\n, the CC50 of those five compounds were as below. The CC50 of catechin (Fig. 1A), kaempferol (Fig. 1C), quercetin hydrate (Fig. 1D) and rutintrihydrate (Fig. 1E) were more than 100 \u03bcg/mL.

Our results demonstrated that catechin and gallic acid exerted protective effects against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection with a dose-dependent manner under 100 \u03bcg/mL and 10 \u03bcg/mL treatment, respectively. The other three compounds also had a protective effect against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, but not as prominent or dose-dependent, in comparison with catechin and gallic acid.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are approved for use against Type A and Type B influenza infections. However, the development of drug resistance due to the use of insufficient doses or inadequate courses of therapy, may limit the future clinical applications of these drugs.12 Based on the limitations of health care resources and the high cost of current antiviral drugs, in addition to the development of drug resistance, the need to develop new anti-influenza treatments is of utmost importance to the global community. Chinese herbs are traditionally used for preventing and treating influenza in Taiwan, especially in rural regions. Recently, Isatisindigotica (Ban-Lan-Gen) has been reported to effectly inhibit the attachment ability of influenza A and B viruses by interfering with the viral particles of the host cell surface.5, 13\nPaeonialactiflora has also been demonstrated to inhibit influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection, both in vitro and in vivo, through viral hemagglutination with viral binding and penetration into host cells.14 Furthermore, Mosladianthera has exhibited therapeutic effects in influenza A virus-infected mice by suppressing the viral replication and inflammatory mediators, and by boosting the antioxidant potential to prevent subsequent pneumonia occurrence.15\n",

Nine compounds present in TS, gallic acid, methyl gallate, catechin, kaempferol, kaempferol 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, quercetin, quercitrin, quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, and rutin, have previously been reported as exerting positive effects in terms of disease treatment .17 Thus, we chose the major five compounds, catechin, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin, which are all commercially available, to further investigate their anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus effects. Analyses found that both catechin and gallic acid had protective effects. The present study demonstrates that gallic acid is effective at inhibiting influenza A (H1N1) virus, but is toxic to A549 cells, in comparison with catechin. While catechin demonstrates an inhibitory effect against the influenza A (H1N1) virus, it is also more promising in terms of safety.

Matsumoto et al found that consuming catechin/theanine for 5 months had a statistically significant preventive effect on clinically defined influenza infection and was well-tolerated.20 They conclude that green tea may be an effective prophylaxis for influenza infection. Furthermore, the clinical trial by Yamada et al has shown that gargling with tea containing catechin extracts had the effect of preventing influenza virus infection in elderly nursing home residents.21 Catechin has been assessed in terms of its ability to interact with influenza neuraminidase, and to significantly suppress the increased ROS level to prevent influenza infection.22, 23 Gallic acid is easy to extract from a number of plants, fruits, teas, and cloves. Gallic acid reportedly has potent and broad antiviral activity against influenza A and B type viruses, both in vitro and in vivo.24 Theisen et al reported the cytotoxic and anti-viral activities against H1N1 virus (H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34-NS116-GFP) of gallic acid with CC50, EC50 and SI were 770.5 \u03bcM, 50.8 \u03bcM, and 15.2 \u03bcM, respectively, which differs from the results reported from the present study.25 This could possibly result from the different viral strains used in experimentation.

Meanwhile, catechin and gallic acid were shown to inhibit the growth of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) with EC50 of 18.4 \u03bcg/mL and 2.6 \u03bcg/mL in MDCK cells, and SI of >5.6 and 8.6, respectively. It indicated that catechin might be a safe reagent for long-term use in the prevention of influenza A (H1N1) virus infection; whereas gallic acid might be a sensitive reagent to inhibit influenza virus infection, and a promising candidate to protect the host against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Therefore, TSL-1 may be used as a food supplement or as an adjunct therapy with current drugs to prevent influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.",

As such, catechin has the promise of being a low-toxic, abundantly available treatment for the prevention of the influenza infection. Furthermore, gallic acid offers the potential of being developed into a new drug due to its significant anti-influenza virus effects, with less cytotoxic effects at low doses to the host cells. However, more specific characterization of the active compounds and mechanisms providing protective effects against influenza virus infection requires further investigation. At present, both catechin and gallic acid may provide effective alternatives as replacements or supplements for currently available anti-influenza remedies.",
