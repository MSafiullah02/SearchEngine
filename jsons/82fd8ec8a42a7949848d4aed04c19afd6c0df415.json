We are squandering our planet's resources and violating nature, which has provided us with everything we need for so long. The pursuit of wealth has resulted in an increasing gap between the rich few and the poor masses. Our privacy is at risk with the widespread use of social media and video cameras on every street corner. Unhealthy lifestyles have caused an epidemic of obesity, and despite the advances in medicine and technology the elderly still are not living happier lives than before. The habits that we developed long ago of gathering food and the necessary supplies to exist have developed into just gathering stuff we rarely use. We have lost touch with nature, so we do not have a clue about what it takes to produce the stuff we buy and consume. We are using up natural resources at a speed that is completely out of tune with the rate at which they were formed. So the pessimists are warning us: we are racing full speed ahead on a dead-end track. So we had better brace ourselves for the crash that is sure to happen sometime soon.",

No problem is so big that we cannot solve it with all the ingenuity we have available . A crisis is something positive, because it drives us to use our creativity to find new solutions. The information age has brought rich and poor together: the world has become flat. People in the 'western world' are no longer tied to fixed jobs for life in corporate or governmental organizations. They take the opportunities of selfemployment, and follow their dream of living a life in which they build on their strengths and have more freedom to choose what they do. Recent developments in the Middle East show that undemocratic regimes that have ruled for decades can suddenly be overthrown by masses of people who-through social mediaunderstand that they are not alone. People in developing countries are no longer stuck in poverty forever. All those with drive and a bit of money-whether it is their own or a microcredit loan-can make themselves useful and contribute to the world's well-being. So optimists are encouraging us to prepare for self-management and empowerment, and to start contributing to and benefiting from the plentiful opportunities that lie ahead.",

Today, many conditions that were fatal in the past can be cured or kept under control. Patients can live longer, with a higher quality of life. But this is also a threat to the costs of the health care system. Some predict that in a few years we will need almost half our workforce to work in health care if we want to maintain the present care levels. Apart from the fact that we would not be able to find so many trained staff at such short notice, you do not need to be a wizard in business economics to calculate that we will never be able to afford the associated costs. Solutions that aim to increase the efficiency of health care actually reduce the amount of social contact between the patient and the caretakers, which then increases the feeling of loneliness. Lonely patients could feel more depressed and anxious about their health. This might in turn lead to more frequent visits to the doctor and regular use of medicines, thus in fact to higher costs of health care.",

Subsequently he was able to get a government loan to extend his clientele, and in 1983 he founded Grameen Bank. Today the bank has lent more than $8 billion to 8.1 million borrowers, 97% of them are women, and changed the lives of 80% of the Bangladeshi families.

A traditional engineering or design problem can be solved at the level of a product. Although engineering or design problems can be challenging because of contradictory requirements, the solution can usually be found within the scope of the product itself, and so the decision can be taken by the lead engineer or product manager. A business problem at the level of a company and its market can usually be solved within the scope of the decisions that a manager can take. But finding real solutions to societal challenges requires the consideration of all these aspects at the same time; it crosses the borders of a single decision-maker. It requires knowledge at the level of the user of the prospective products and services, the level of the organization that will bring those products and/or services to the market, the level of the ecosystem that links the various products and services to their users and other stakeholders, and the level of society that will reap the benefits of the solution. By linking the views, opportunities and resources of these levels, the goal becomes clearer and solutions can be strengthened.",

This means two things: we need to make a compelling offer that users are willing and able to buy, and moreover we also need them to use it extensively. For example, to tackle obesity among children we could launch a game that needs them to be physically active. If we take a narrow view, we can claim the product is a success if more than the expected numbers are sold at the recommended retail price. But in a wider view, it can only be a success if the children are indeed more physically active over a longer period of time and eventually loose weight. So it is not enough just to sell those products, they also need extended usage to provide longer-term societal benefit.

Services are considered as economic goods consisting of labor, advice, managerial skills etc. [7] . Service industries account for an ever-increasing proportion of the national income in nearly all developed countries. Services differ from the production of goods in a number of respects [5] [14] : their intangibility; the fact that customers are directly involved and participate in the delivery, and therefore the production and consumption takes place simultaneously; their perishability; and the differences in experience of different consumers. Where competition is strong, and customers can choose from a wide variety of offers, it becomes important to distinguish the offering. The distinguishing factor in services is the experience. Buyers of experiences want to be engaged by what the company reveals over time. Companies strive to stage customer surprise, exploiting the difference between what the customer gets to perceive and what the customer expects to get [9] . This is quite a contrast with the 'industrial' notion of customer satisfaction that strives to meet the expectations of larger customer groups. In creating an experience a personal element is taken into account, and the aim is to surprise the customer. For returning customers, it also means that the company has to keep a record of the past experiences of each specific customer because just providing exactly the same as in the past might not create the desired surprising effect. To continue to appeal to customers, organizations need to carefully manage the experience they create.",

In these networks, knowledge workers collaborate and share in internal transparency. They communicate directly rather than through hierarchies. And they innovate and work toward common goals in self-organization instead of being ordered to do so. The World Wide Web itself and Linux are examples of successful innovations in such networks [2] . These examples also show that new business models came into use with the knowledge economy, and the traditional direct exchange model has been replaced by services that are offered for free, but have other ways to generate revenues such as through advertisements or 'clicks'.",

The investment needed to set up a business in the knowledge economy is extremely low: a PC with an Internet connection will do. For people who want more control over their daily activities, it is economically feasible to become self-employed and pick the projects they want to do. They benefit from more freedom in what they do, and when they do it. Knowledge workers are not bound by regular office hours. For companies this means additional flexibility. But there is also a challenge: they will need to stay attractive to the more flexible workforce, as good people are much more mobile than before.",

For two reasons: it needs to be, and it can be. Transformation is defined as a marked change in form, nature or appearance [6] . A European Union think tank expects that the next 20 years will be disruptive: a new multi-polar world is emerging in which power is more diffuse and international dynamics is more complex, against the background of sweeping societal transformations that include an ageing society, declining domestic supplies of labor and technological and communications revolutions that are changing both private and professional relationships and imposing new patterns of life [12] . In this age, transformation will take place at societal level, through large numbers of individuals willingly contributing to it. This transformation is needed because of the abundant negative side effects of the industrial age: the threats referred to before are real. This transformation is also possible because by building on the knowledge-based economy, and on the willingness of many people to contribute to higher goals and live more meaningful lives, we can seize the opportunities.",
