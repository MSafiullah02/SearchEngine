The EAV genome is a positive, single-stranded, 5(-capped and 3(-polyadenylated mRNA molecule with a length of 12,704 nucleotides (nt). During EAV replication, a 3(-coterminal nested set of seven virus-specific RNAs (RNAs 1 through 7) is produced which direct the synthesis of structural and non-structural viral proteins [2]. Each open reading frame (ORF) in the EAV genome is preceded by the pentanucleotide sequence motif 5(-UCAAC-3(, also called the leader-body junction site [3, 4] or the transcription regulating sequence (TRS) [5]. The TRS motifs, in conjunction with neighboring nt, are key elements involved in the synthesis of the 3(-coterminal nested set of six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs [6, 7] through their fusion, most likely by a discontinuous minus-strand transcription mechanism, with a common leader sequence of 206 nt identical to and derived from the extreme 5( terminus of the viral genome [8].",

This ILO was predicted to encode a peptide of 37 amino acids and appeared to be conserved among different EAV isolates [10] which suggested that it may be of functional significance for the virus. Further analysis showed that the ILO start codon was present in a suboptimal context to initiate protein translation, which might explain the efficient translation of the ORFs located downstream of the leader sequence on each EAV mRNA. Because short ORFs within the 5( leader region of other viral mRNAs have been reported to down-regulate the rate of translation of downstream ORFs [11\u201313], we hypothesized that the EAV ILO might similarly affect the synthesis of the EAV proteins or have another regulatory function in the life cycle of the virus.",

Three microliter of total RNA isolated from the EAV-infected cells at 10 h post-infection (pi) were used as template in a reverse transcription (RT) reaction catalyzed by the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). As primer for cDNA synthesis, an oligonucleotide (Peav3() complementary to the extreme 3( end of the EAV genomic and sg viral RNAs was used. The cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a primer pair consisting of the antisense oligonucleotide Peav3( and the sense oligonucleotide P(wt)atg which corresponds to the extreme 5( end of the EAV leader sequence (Table 1). By doing so, we generated a DNA copy of EAV mRNA7 downstream of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter, which was introduced by the sense primer. After agarose gel purification, the RNA7-specific DNA fragment was cut with BamHI and SalI and ligated into BamHI- and SalI-digested plasmid vector pUC18 (InVitrogen). The resulting plasmid, designated F7wtATG, was sequenced to verify the correctness of the cloned fragment.

In this pBR322-based construct, the genomic sequence of the Utrecht variant of the Bucyrus strain of EAV is preceded by a bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. To generate three new EAV cDNA clones, a series of PCRs was performed by using plasmid pBRNX1.038 as a template, the ORF 1a-specific oligonucleotide P962 as an antisense primer, and the leader-specific oligonucleotides PT7(wt)atg, PT7(ko)atg, or PT7(opt)atg as alternative sense primers (Table 1). The resulting PCR products were digested with NotI and ApoI and stored as fragments of 897 nt in length until used. Another aliquot of plasmid pBRNX1.038 was digested with the unique restriction enzymes NotI and EcoRV, which generates fragments of 12,672 and 4,282 nt, respectively. The small fragment, which contained the SP6 promoter sequence and the wild-type ILO start codon, was purified from the gel and digested with ApoI to obtain a 891-nt NotI\u2013ApoI fragment and a 3391-nt ApoI\u2013EcoRV fragment. The latter DNA fragment was gel-purified and stored until further use. It is noteworthy that there was a 6 nt difference in length between the NotI\u2013ApoI fragments generated by PCR and the NotI\u2013ApoI fragment obtained by digestion of plasmid pBRNX1.038. This difference is due to the insertion of a KpnI site between the NotI site and the T7 promoter sequence in primers PT7(wt)atg, PT7(ko)atg and PT7(opt)atg (Table 1). The additional KpnI site allowed us to distinguish, by restriction enzyme analysis, the original SP6 promoter-containing infectious cDNA clone pBRNX1.038 from the newly generated T7 promoter-containing full-length EAV cDNA clones.",

Accordingly, we were able to successfully generate a rabbit antiserum directed against a synthetic version of the protein. However, with this serum, we failed to detect the IL peptide in EAV-infected cells either by immunofluorescence, or by Western blot, or by RIPA (data not shown). We next generated a plasmid (F7wtATG) containing the EAV mRNA7 sequence downstream of a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In vitro transcripts derived from F7wtATG were translated in vitro and the translation products were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2a (lane 1), polypeptide species of 14 and 4 kDa were detected corresponding to the N protein and the IL peptide, respectively. This result demonstrates that EAV mRNA7 is functionally bicistronic. Because the ILO start codon present in this wild-type construct is in the suboptimal context for translation initiation (13), we decided to introduce point mutations at the 5( end of the ILO to improve or abrogate its translation. As shown in Fig. 2a (lanes 2 and 3), the IL peptides from mutant plasmids F7(koz)ATG and F7(opt)ATG (in which the context of the ILO initiation codon was improved) were detected at levels comparable to that of the wild-type construct. As expected, lower amounts of the IL peptide were obtained with the construct F7(nf)ATG which had the ILO AUG codon placed in an unfavorable context for initiation of translation (Fig. 2a, lane 5). No translation product was observed from the mutant clone F7(\u2212)ATG in which the ILO initiation codon was abrogated (Fig. 2a, lane 4). To confirm that the 4 kDa translation product is encoded by the ILO, RIPAs were performed using the rabbit anti-IL peptide serum or the corresponding preimmune serum (Fig. 2b). This experiment proved that the 4 kDa protein is encoded by the ILO and corroborated the previous finding that the amount of IL peptide synthesized depends on the context of the ILO start codon.\n\n",

Hence, we were quite surprized not being able to detect the EAV IL peptide in infected cells despite the mRNA7 abundance, neither by RIPA nor by Western blotting or immunofluoresence assay. This negative result can be explained in a number of ways. First, the IL peptide might simply not be produced during virus replication or be synthesized in very low amounts. Second, the folding of the IL peptide in a reticulocyte lysate may be different from that in virus-infected cells and may hence interfere with its detection. Third, the IL peptide might be rapidly degraded in cells, which would be consistent with our inability to detect the protein by expression from the plasmid using the vaccinia virus vTF7-3 expression system, while synthesis of N protein from this plasmid was clearly observed (data not shown).",

Expression of the different genes is regulated by particular sequence conditions. Unless driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), the expression of a downstream ORF is generally inefficient. Accordingly, the in vitro expression of N protein was reduced when the EAV ILO initiation codon was functional, suggestive of a leaky scanning mechanism and consistent with the reported IRES-independent mechanism of translation of EAV mRNAs [7]. The significance, however, of such an attenuating effect of the ILO on the expression of all EAV genes is as yet hard to understand. Also for the related coronaviruses, which are generally devoid of an intraleader ORF, short ILO\u2019s have been described [11, 12] but their translation products have never been detected.",

When we blocked the expression of the ILO, the mutant virus was able to produce infectious virions, consistent with an earlier study [23] showing EAV infectivity to be maintained after disruption of the intraleader AUG codon. However, unlike this study, modulating the ILO translation efficiency, either positively or negatively, by mutation of the AUG codon or of its context sequence, significantly affected viral characteristics. Mutations that had been confirmed in vitro to either block or enhance the expression of the ILO both resulted in viruses that exhibited delayed growth kinetics, reduced virus yields and smaller plaque size. These mutations appeared to be rapidly restored during serial passages of the viruses. Already during the first cycle a significant fraction of both mutant viruses had reverted to the wild-type phenotype and this effect became progressively complete following subsequent rounds of infection. Phenotypic restoration indeed correlated with genetic correction of the mutations as demonstrated by sequencing.",

Either the peptide has no function at all or, though not essential, it does play some subtle role. In the latter case one might envision that a certain, delicate level of the peptide is required for optimal replication. The amount of peptide synthesized would be regulated precisely by the particular sequence context of the initiating AUG. This context would understandably be suboptimal as the efficient expression of the ILO would, through its negative effect on downstream ORFs, be at the unfavorable expense of the synthesis of all other viral proteins. The rapid repair of the mutations that we introduced in and around the AUG sequence would also be consistent with the requirement for a dosed translation of the ILO. What functions the translation product would serve remains as yet unknown. In the alternative interpretation, the IL peptide per se is irrelevant. In that case, it must be the nucleotide sequence at and around the AUG that is of importance.",

            "text": "It has been reported that a 68 nt sequence within the antileader sequence of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), another arterivirus, constitutes the specific binding site of four cellular proteins [24]. Cellular proteins appeared to bind to similar regions in the antileader of other arteriviruses including EAV, an observation that we recently confirmed [25]. In addition, we also observed cellular proteins to bind to the EAV leader RNA positive strand and showed that nt 140\u2013206 are not necessary for this binding. Hence, in addition to the base pairing in the vicinity of the leader TRS required for viral transcription, other key functions important in the EAV life cycle appear to reside in the 5( region of the leader sequence, and the ILO sequence might be one of these. Whether the cellular proteins bind to the ILO, and more particularly to the region carrying the AUG sequence, has yet to be determined. As was done for the 68 nt sequence of SHFV to which cellular protein binds [24], we [10] and others [6] predicted secondary structures in the 5( genomic region of several EAV isolates. It appears that the ILO AUG codon occurs in a stem-loop structure, base pairing with nucleotides at positions 38\u201340. By using the Mfold version 3.1 software of Zuker et al. [26] to predict the secondary structures, the G-to-T mutation introduced in the EAV leader sequence leads to the formation of a small internal loop and a small bulge downstream and in front of the mutation site, respectively. However, the T-to-A mutation leads to the formation of a small internal loop at the mutation site. Whether these secondary structures in the vicinity of the ILO AUG play a role in interactions between the viral RNA and cellular proteins remain to be investigated.",

Their sequences are important for recognition by viral and host cell proteins that mediate these processes. In nidovirus replication, the 3(-terminal sequences of the minus strand RNAs, i.e. the sequences complementary to the leader, direct the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. It is thus quite plausible that strong selective pressures exist to maintain these sequences. The precision with which the G-to-T mutation in the ILO AUG and the T-to-A mutation at position -3 were repaired supports this view, as does the apparent instability of the reported A-to-G mutation in the AUG [23]. The latter mutation had an identical effect (i.e. complete inhibition) on the expression of the ILO as had our G-to-T mutation. Yet, in contrast to our results, viral replication efficiency nor plaque size were significantly affected. We therefore favor the idea that the IL peptide has no functional significance but that it is the precise nucleotide sequence that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.",
