Histopathological analysis of lung sections revealed that intratracheal LPS administration caused alveolar haemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration and severe lung interstitial oedema, and that this injury was suppressed by oral carnosine administration (Fig. 1a). Intratracheal LPS administration increased vascular permeability in lung tissue, and simultaneous carnosine administration suppressed this increase (Fig. 1b). Protein concentration in BALF, an indicator of lung injury and oedema, was also increased by LPS administration, and carnosine administration suppressed this increase (Fig. 1c). Moreover, LPS administration induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-6, IL-6) and chemokines (chemokine (CXC motif) ligand-1, CXCL1, and CXCL2) in lung tissue, whereas carnosine administration significantly suppressed this increase, except for TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 1d). In contrast, carnosine did not affect the LPS-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88). Overall, the results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that oral carnosine administration protects mice against LPS-induced lung injury.",

We also examined the effect of carnosine on myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (a marker of neutrophilic inflammation) in lung tissues. As shown in Fig. 3c, MPO activity in lung tissues was increased by LPS administration and this increase was suppressed by oral carnosine administration.

The expression of Cit-H3 in BALF was also induced by the LPS treatment, and was suppressed by carnosine administration (Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, the expression of Cit-H3 in lung tissue was induced by LPS treatment, and again was clearly suppressed by carnosine administration (Fig. 4d).

As shown in Figs 3 and 4, carnosine administration inhibited LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation. Furthermore, as shown in Figs 5 and 6, carnosine administration inhibited the LPS-dependent ER stress response. ROS are reportedly thought to induce neutrophilic inflammation and the ER stress response19242636. For example, extracellular superoxide induces NETs, and treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, inhibits this NETs induction40. Regarding ER stress, cigarette smoke extract induces the apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells through a superoxide anion-triggered signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase\u2013eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha kinase (PERK-eIF2a, one of the ER stress sensors)41. We showed that carnosine administration suppressed the LPS-dependent ROS increase in lung tissue (Fig. 2). Considering these results, we suggest that carnosine suppressed both neutrophilic inflammation and the ER stress response by suppressing LPS-dependent ROS increases.",

For example, Cu/Zn-SOD or lecithinized Cu/Zn-SOD administration is also protective in ARDS-related animal models4849. The new vitamin E derivative, ETS-GS, protected against CLP-induced systemic inflammation in rats50. Early administration of lipoic acid provided protective effects against LPS-induced oxidative stress in the lung51. Moreover, simvastatin reduced LPS-induced lung injury by decreasing neutrophil recruitment and radical formation52. Some investigations suggested beneficial effects of statins therapy in patients with sepsis and ARDS5354, although stains have not been approved for this use. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the protective effects of carnosine against LPS-induced lung injury with those of other antioxidant molecules. Furthermore, combination effects of other antioxidants with carnosine have been reported in other organs. For example, carnosine plus vitamin E treatment more strongly suppressed LPS-induced liver injury compared with carnosine or vitamin E alone55. Moreover, \u03b1-lipoic acid and carnosine supplementation increased antioxidant activity in the serum, liver and skin of rats56. Examining combination effects of other antioxidants with carnosine in the LPS-induced lung injury model would be highly worthwhile.",
