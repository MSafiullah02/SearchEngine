Only in the last two centuries vaccination has become a viable strategy to prevent such epidemics. In addition to the clinical efficacy of this strategy, the behavior and public attitudes affect the success of vaccines. This paper describes modeling the efficacy of vaccination considering the cost and benefit of vaccination to individual players. The model is based on the public goods game and is presented as a spatial game on a lattice. Using this model, individuals can contribute to the public health by paying the cost of vaccination or choose to be protected by the public who is vaccinated rather than pay the cost and share the risk of vaccination. Thus, in this model individuals can choose to stay susceptible, can become infected, or choose to vaccinate once in each episode. This paper presents the behavioral changes of the population and the cost to the society as a function of the cost of vaccines, cost of being infected, and the \"fear factor\" created by the public media.",

Similarly, the New England Journal of Medicine has raised the concern that the climate change will cause a significant increase in infectious disease, especially vector-borne and waterborne diseases [4] . This is due to the fact that insect vectors tend to be more active at higher temperatures.

In this model, states R and V are the absorbing states. The spread of infectious disease can be studied at the population level or based on a social interacting network. The network-based model can better describe the spread of infectious diseases since many diseases are transmitted with a direct or close contact between individuals. The network-based models have been widely studied in recent research works. For example, Fu et al. [10] modeled the role of imitation behavior in a spatial structure and showed that the spatial structure is more sensitive to changes in the cost of vaccination. Fukuda et al. [11] applied the same model but instead of one network of interactions, they defined two networks, in which one is the disease transmission network and the other one is the information transmission network.",

The idea of being protected by the population of vaccinated individuals is not always effective if there are not enough vaccinated individuals or motivators to encourage individuals to get vaccinated. To illustrate, in 2015, California faced the worst Measles epidemic in the last decades because many parents declined to vaccinate their children due to vaccine side effects and by blindly relying on the other vaccinated ones to be safe [15] .

The spatial game theory has been used to consider the spatial network-based structure of the population of players. In this model, in every time step, all susceptible players update their strategy for getting vaccine or not synchronously and then each of them might be infected based on its strategy and the probability of becoming infected. In order to update the strategy to get vaccine or not, different methods have been used. In the classical method of updating strategy, each player updates its strategy to the strategy of the player with the highest payoff in its neighborhood [14] . In many other studies, the Fermi function is used as a probability function to change to the strategy of a neighbor [10] , [16] - [18] . In this paper, a new approach in updating the strategy is used in which each susceptible player updates its strategy not just to the strategy of the neighbor with the highest payoff but also to the strategy of the number of neighbors with the highest payoffs. Thus, if there is someone vaccinated among the neighbors with the highest payoff, the player will change its strategy to get the vaccine. The sensitivity factor is a measure for the number of neighbors with the highest payoff that a player refers to in order to update its strategy. This sensitivity factor can be considered as a surrogate form of fear factor or the effect of media on making people aware of the severity of a disease. The concept of the effect of media and fear factor on individual's decision is studied in some research trying to show how it can affect the spread of infectious diseases [19] - [22] .",

Thus, to examine the effect of C V on the epidemic and the number of vaccinated individuals, a simulation model was generated. The model was run on a 50 \u00d7 50 lattice, in which the initial number of infected and vaccinated individuals is distributed randomly.

Fig. 5(a) shows the number of free riders, infected, and vaccinated individuals under different vaccination costs when s = 1. Fig. 5(a) shows that as predicted increasing the vaccination cost will decrease the number of vaccination to the point that no one decides to get vaccinated other than the initially vaccinated ones. However, comparing this result with the one with a higher sensitivity factor [s = 4, Fig. 5(b) ] shows that increasing the sensitivity can result in more vaccinated individuals and also more free riders which is beneficial to the society. Moreover, in the experiments, it can be seen that higher sensitivity factor can result in better control of the epidemic for any vaccination cost C V as long as the value of C V is not too high resulting in no additional vaccinated individual. These phenomena can be seen from Fig. 6(a) and (b) . Fig. 6(a) shows the result of updating the lattice when C V = 10 (left) and C V = 100 (right) for s = 1, and Fig. 6(b) shows the result of updating the lattice when C V = 10 (left) and C V = 100 (right) for s = 4. It can be seen that when s is higher there are some clusters of vaccinated individuals who surround infected individuals and cause the epidemic to be controlled more effectively. As a result, the number of free riders (purple cells) increases because there is enough protection provided by vaccinated individuals. Thus, the society benefits from a lower cost of vaccination and disease in comparison with the same level of protection when all the individuals are vaccinated. It is worth to mention that the epidemic season length did not show a meaningful relation with the cost of vaccination.",

The result of changing the percentage of initially vaccinated individuals shows that increasing the percentage of vaccinated individuals is beneficial to the society as long as the number of vaccinated is not beyond a certain percentage causing some individuals to get the benefits of living among vaccinated individuals in an immune society. As it is apparently shown in Fig. 10 , the number of free riders will increase as the number of initially vaccinated increase, but it will start to decrease as the number of vaccinated increase more than 20%. These experiments are done in a 50 \u00d7 50 lattice when C V = 10, \u03b2 = 0.2, and s = 4, while changing the percentage of initially vaccinated ones (V 0 ) from 1% to 50%. Moreover, the number of finally vaccinated individuals does not exhibit a large change for different experiments while as the number of initially vaccinated ones increases the number of individuals who decide to get vaccine decrease. This can be better seen when we plot the number of individuals who decide to get vaccine during the epidemic (Fig. 10-yellow line) . This decrease in the number of voluntary vaccination can be explained by the \"group protection\" that more vaccinated individuals provide. In addition, the graph of infected individuals shows that as we increase the number of initially vaccinated people linearly, the number of infected people will decrease much faster. It is worth mentioning that in all the experiments for Fig. 10 , the number of initially infected individuals was 5% of the population. Studying the behavior of population using different sensitivity factors and initial vaccination rate shows that the higher sensitivity will cause the number of free riders to grow faster. In Fig. 11 , each line shows the number of free riders for each value of s from 1 to 6, and it is apparent that as the value of s increases the number of free riders increase. This can be explained by the fact that increasing the number of vaccinated individuals in the cooperation group provides more protection and reduces the number of infected individuals and reduces the need of individuals to get vaccinated. It is worth to add that this result is true when the number of initially vaccinated is less than 20% because the number of free riders will start to decrease as we increase the number of initially vaccinated individuals as it can be seen from Fig. 10 .",

In the first scenario, the vaccinated individuals are distributed randomly in the population [ Fig. 12(a) ], in the second one, the vaccinated individuals are evenly distributed in the lattice [ Fig. 12(b) ] and in the third scenario, the vaccinated individuals grouped into larger clusters (of nine individuals) that are evenly distributed in the lattice [ Fig. 12(c) ]. In all scenarios, the number of vaccinated and infected individuals is the same. These experiments are done in a 50 \u00d7 50 lattice considering C V = 10, \u03b2 = 0.2, and s = 4. Table II shows the result of each scenario. In all the three scenarios, the number of initially vaccinated is 144 which is approximately 5% of the population. We can see from Table II that if the individuals are evenly distributed, we will have few numbers of infection and vaccination and more free riders. This result is the effect of accessibility of vaccinated individuals in all cooperation groups; so, individuals can decide sooner to get vaccine confronting a disease epidemic and can also save others from being infected. Moreover, the result shows that group vaccination is less effective while there might be some vaccination not necessary for people who are not at risk of being infected, and also more initial vaccinations are needed to support this society. However, if we distribute groups such that they are more reachable for other individuals for imitating their behavior, the result will be improved.",

Fig. 13 shows that as the sensitivity factor increases the infection has a lower chance to affect other people while individuals respond sooner to epidemic. In these experiments, we have considered C V = 1 and \u03b2 = 0.2.

            "text": "We have also examined the result of changing sensitivity factor when updating a lattice with distribution of players for three different vaccination costs (Figs. 14-18). In the diagrams, the blue lines show the experiments for C v = 1, orange lines show the experiments for C v = 10, and gray lines show the experiments for C v = 100. Fig. 14 illustrates the total cost of each lattice of players. This cost is calculated using the following formula which shows the total cost of being infected or vaccinated for the society: We can see that as the number of free riders increases, and the ratio of infected-to-vaccinated individuals decreases, the total cost decreases. This means that the society could control the spread of disease with minimum number of vaccinated individuals. In Fig. 14 , the total cost decreases for all three different vaccination costs as the sensitivity factor increases but it does not change much for s \u2265 5. Fig. 15 shows the number of vaccinated players in the last lattice for each scenario. We can see that for sensitivity factors greater than 4, the number of vaccinated individuals does not change notably. However, the final number of vaccinated individuals is greater when the cost of vaccination is low. Fig. 16 shows the number of recovered individuals in the last lattice. In the last lattice, the epidemic season is over, and all the infected individuals have changed their state to \"recovered.\" Thus, the number of recovered individuals is used to represent the number of individuals infected during each run. Fig. 16 shows that the number of recovered individuals has the same behavior as the total cost; this is due to the high cost of infection relative to the cost of vaccination and the effect of the high number of infected individuals on the total cost. Also, Fig. 16 demonstrates again that more people will be infected as the cost of vaccine increases. Fig. 17 shows the number of free riders in each experiment. As can be seen, this number increases as sensitivity increases but levels off after s = 5. Based on this output, we conclude that the sensitivity factor that maximizes the number of free riders is s = 5 independently of the cost of vaccination. It is interesting to observe as discussed earlier that a higher s factor that relates to the fear of individuals from being infected is proportional to the number of free riders (who choose not to vaccinate). This counter intuitive result can be explained as a society that is more active in protecting itself also provides protection to free riders who benefit from this anxiety. This shows that the best policy in society is to follow the majority of the comparison group. Fig. 18 shows the duration of the epidemic season in each experiment. Based on this result, we can conclude that the length of an episode is mainly affected by the cost of vaccination; since cheaper vaccination results in an increase in the number of vaccinated individuals and cause the epidemic to end sooner. Similarly, if the sensitivity factor is increased, the duration of an epidemic is reduced. This is explained by the society that exhibits a higher sensitivity to the risk of being infected and is more proactive in vaccinating.",

In this model, the payoff of each player is calculated using a function in which every cost of individuals in a 3 \u00d7 3 group is divided between the members of that group. These costs are the cost of infection for infected people in the group, cost of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, probable cost of being infected for susceptible people, and cost of being recovered for recovered individuals. Using the payoff of each player, individuals try to imitate the behavior of the people who are in the groups with the lowest cost or the highest payoff. The sensitivity factor is one of the parameters which is introduced to show the risk tolerance (fear) of players encouraging switching to the strategy of their neighbors. The sensitivity factor can show the number of neighbors with the highest payoffs in the candidate list of the players; so, if any vaccinated individual is in this candidate list, the player will be encouraged to get vaccinated. Although in our model, the sensitivity factor is not varying among players and is considered to be influenced by the social media, it can cause different behaviors in populations. Using this model, we can show that if the cost of vaccination is increased, players have less tendency to get vaccinated, which is a representative behavior to a real-world situation.",

Moreover, increasing the sensitivity can be beneficial for the society as individuals react to the epidemic sooner and decide faster to get vaccine in order to save themselves and their community, but increasing the sensitivity factor too much does not lead to an optimal cost for the society. The results show that increasing the sensitivity factor to more than 5 does reduce cost while the number of free riders dose not increase and the number of vaccinated and infected individuals does not change. This behavior is the result of dissuasive effect of selecting the strategy of the neighbors who have a higher payoff than the payoff of the player itself on the candidate list.",
