Branching outside the foods the child has safely eaten in the past can seem risky in the current environment and families may chance multiple trips to markets with diminished options in order to find familiar foods rather than try something new. Therefore, it is important that families feel confident in reading product labels as new products may be the better or only option. For most children with FPIES, the risk of reacting to trace exposures due to cross-contact is low. (2) (Figure 1\n) Products may contain unfamiliar ingredients that are confusing and parents might worry these ingredients will perhaps trigger a reaction. Generally safe ingredients that are not likely to trigger a reaction are listed in Figure 1. Label reading skills in the age of COVID are now more valuable than ever.",

Therefore, the EG-FPIES recommend during this time discussing food introductions with the physician and introducing lower risk foods at home more cautiously with a gradual approach over 5-10 days, starting from a very small amount and doubling this amount twice daily until a full serving is reached. Additionally the EG-FPIES suggest physicians consider providing certain patients with FPIES > 6 months a prescription for oral ondansetron to be used at home in case of an acute reaction in addition to the emergency action plan.

            "text": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding until about 6 months-of-age. We recommend introducing low risk, nutritionally important complementary foods by 6 months to meet growing nutritional needs, most especially in the breastfed infant, as exclusive breastfeeding for > 6 months has been associated with increased risk of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) at 9 months-of-age.(2) Finding safe high-iron foods is a struggle in general for children with FPIES as the highest iron infant foods are iron-fortified grains, introduction of which are typically delayed in children with FPIES. Other high iron, lower risk foods for children with FPIES are lamb, prunes, and pseudo or ancient grains e.g. fortified quinoa and millet. Alternatively, until iron-containing complementary foods have been introduced an iron supplement (1mg /kg/ day elemental iron) can be provided to help fill the nutritional gaps of a limited predominantly breast milk diet after 4-6 months of age as recommended by the AAP.(2) Vitamin/mineral supplementation should occur per country-specific guidelines, and in the US that also includes 400 IU vitamin D daily for breastfed infants and infants receiving <1L formula. US infant formulas contain sufficient iron to meet nutritional needs when consumed in adequate volume, and therefore formula-fed infants are not likely to need iron supplementation. Once a child reaches 12 months-of-age, continuing on breast milk or formula is necessary if the diet is not varied and cannot support nutritional needs. Calcium intake (700mg/day, 1-4 years) should be assessed at this time. Due to possible irregularities in availability of over-the-counter, extensively-hydrolyzed formula during the pandemic, a prescription for an amino acid-based formula may be required. Formula and breastfed infants will benefit from introduction of lower risk foods, continuing to vary the textures of the diet based on infant\u2019s age and feeding skills. Children usually begin with a smooth puree, progress to thicker purees, lumpier purees and then soft finger foods. This can be done even with only a few foods in the diet. A variety of fruits and vegetables fall into the lower risk category that can help with nutrition and feeding skill development. Consultation with a registered dietitian will help guide food and nutrition choices and many dietitians are available via telehealth during this time.",

However, infant\u2019s diets, feeding skills and nutritional needs change rapidly over the first year of life so that delays in feeding even for just 1-2 months may have a significant impact on overall health, feeding skills, and food preferences. Empowering families to safely choose foods will help minimize some of the stress associated with this pandemic. Timely introduction of nutritionally important complementary foods or nutrient supplementation is important to prevent IDA, provide adequate nutrition, and support the development of feeding skills and preference for healthy foods.",
