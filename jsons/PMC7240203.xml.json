It is a single, unified dataset with 192 columns, containing several country profile characteristics, mobility data, and COVID-19 epidemiological data, ranging from February 15, 2020 to May 7, 2020. Sociodemographic data include demographic, geographic, industry, trade, government expenditure, ecologic, and political data. Mobility metrics refer to the variation in attendance to location categories when compared to a baseline period, between January 3 and February 6, before the beginning of the social distancing initiatives outside China. If a country had 15.0 for a specific day, a Thursday, for example, in the residential variable, this means that on that date there was a 15% positive variation in visits/staytime when compared to the median of Thursdays between January 3 and February 6 in residential areas for that country. Epidemiological data includes the daily new and accumulated number of cases of and deaths due to COVID-19, among other variables. More information can be found in the supplementary file 1 (S1 - Data Dictionary.xls).",

To unify the remaining datasets considered, we adopted the list of countries and dates available in these reports. This decision is further justified by the impact of mobility metrics in the analysis of social distancing. The sociodemographic data for countries comes from a set of 35 datasets downloaded from UN Data, the data portal for the United Nations [1]. The daily data related to the number of new cases and new deaths by COVID-19 for countries were downloaded from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the dataset was downloaded as a CSV file from their official website [3]. Exceptions are Hong Kong and R\u00e9union, that were not present in the ECDC dataset and were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 repository on GitHub [4].",

First, we normalized country names to use them as merging key since there were minor differences in the name of the countries among the datasets. Second, we used the most up-to-date variable whenever the different datasets provided the same variable for different times. Third, new variables were engineered to enrich the dataset, which includes most of the epidemiological variables mentioned so far. For instance, we provide the date of the first COVID-19 case in each country, even for the ones that had the first case before February 15, 2020, the first date in our dataset. For countries that had the first case before February 15, we collected dates from media reports. Additional variables were computed taking as reference this per-country first case date: (i) number of days since the first case; (ii) number of days since the first death; (iii) accumulated number of cases since the first case; (iv) accumulated number of deaths since the first death; (v) date of first confirmed death, and (vi) date of first confirmed case. Finally, we also provide the latest COVID-19 lethality rate for each country.",
