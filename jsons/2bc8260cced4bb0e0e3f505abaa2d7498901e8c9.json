The aim was to analyze if P. jirovecii low-titer detections have more impact than just colonization. From our total cohort of patients for which P. jirovecii testing by qPCR was requested, we selected exclusively those that were fully immunocompetent. Patients were defined as fully immunocompetent if they did not receive immunosuppressive therapy, displayed regular antibody titers, and did not suffer from acquired, inherited or autoimmune diseases. Only those patients with complete medical records available were included. A retrospective analysis identified patients with P. jirovecii colonization and successful antibiotic therapy in response to laboratory pathogen detection. We identified 30 fully immunocompetent patients with P. jirovecii colonization suspected to suffer from infection with the pathogen, but with milder symptoms than pneumonia. All patients were successfully treated with cotrimoxazole against P. jirovecii and resolved from chronic cough and recurrent pulmonary infections. The fact that all patients displayed recovery from their clinical symptoms gives raise to the hypothesis that P. jirovecii infections may also occur in immunocompetent patients but with milder symptoms.",

In order to develop effective therapies against a pathogen such as P. jirovecii, this pathogen needs to be efficiently cultured to be studied. Despite generations of microbiologists that tried to establish an efficient culturing system for P. jirovecii, all previous attempts to establish such a system failed. This serious gap could be closed by a novel and potent cell culture system that enable growths and passaging of P. jirovecii. Using an approach that is novel for the field of microbiology, we succeeded in solving this issue. We used novel air-liquid interface cultures that simulate the natural locus of P. jirovecii infection, i.e., the airway epithelia. By using this approach the colleagues were able to grow P. jirovecii, and the number of fungus particles significantly increased [9] .",

So far it was assumed that patients of this cohort will solely suffer from an infection with P. jirovecii when being immunosuppressed.

This algorithm is used in the case of patients with symptoms of respiratory infections, i.e., to avoid pneumonia by early diagnosis. For this reason we also test otherwise healthy patients for P. jirovecii. During the study period, the laboratory received 976 BAL samples in total. On request, 533 BALs (54.6%) were tested for P. jirovecii; of those, a PCR-positive test result was obtained in 129 BALs (13.2%). No other pathogens were detected. In detail, the BALs were negative for influenza viruses, parainfluenzaviruses 1-4, RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), HMPV (Human Metapneumovirus), coronaviruses NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU-1, adenoviruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycobacteria, mumps, measles, human herpesviruses 1-8, parechoviruses, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, Legionella pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Aspergillus and Bordetella pertussis by molecularbiological assays and culturing.",

None of these 30 patients with a full documented medical history suffered from clinical or radiological signs of PCP, but all reported recurrent airway infections and chronic cough. Being negatively tested for all important respiratory viruses and bacteria, all patients tested positive for P. jirovecii by qPCR. The titers were approximately 10 8 mtLSU copies per ml of BAL fluid, which corresponds to a 10 4 -10 6 lower number of nuclear genomes (i.e., a 10 5 -10 7 lower number of fungal particles) [9] . Although there is no universal guideline, there is consent that higher P. jirovecii titers are more frequently associated with pneumonia, while lower titers often indicate a milder colonization; however, there is no consent on the cut-off values, nor is there any standardization or consent that clearly discriminates between colonization and infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . A novel approach was made by Louis et al., who, for the first time, tried to harmonize the cut-off value, while also addressing the general problem that international standard cut-off values are still missing due to the different targets of qPCR (e.g., mtLSU gene vs. MSG (multicopy surface glycoprotein gene)) [31] .",

Moreover, we could not exclude the possibility that the 30 cases which we reported suffered from putatively self-limiting infections and thus did not require the treatment, in spite of the fact that the treatment obviously was successful and eliminated the clinical symptoms. In future studies it will be necessary to analyze how many detected P. jirovecii cases with low fungal titers are associated with chronic respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the frequency of P. jirovecii colonization needs to be elucidated, as thus far mainly hospitalized patients will be tested for P. jirovecii, but the number of colonized patients in the non-hospitalized cohort may differ.",
