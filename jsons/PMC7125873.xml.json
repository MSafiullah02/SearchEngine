For an archipelagic country such as the Philippines that is blessed with beautiful, world-class beaches and coastal resources, tourism is vital to its overall socioeconomic development plan. Considered as part of a country's export industry\u2014with importers as tourists visiting the country\u2014tourism has the potential to unlock innumerable economic opportunities for a country: from increased foreign currency receipts to the generation of jobs from allied industries such as the hotel, entertainment, transportation, and food industries. Much of this promise though hangs on how government is able to address the safety and security issues of its civil aviation system, such as airports and airlines, which tourists and business travelers consider important.",

The threat of hijacking, drug trafficking, and bomb scare in airplanes and airports are all very real for the air transport industry, especially after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States (US). In order to prevent these incidents, governments\u2014on their own and in the interest of making air travel safer and more secure, have made investments to improve the security infrastructure and management of their civil aviation system. To verify whether improvements in the civil aviation safety standards are tenable and compliant with mutually-agreed civil aviation safety and security standards, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken on the role as verifier and arbiter of air transport safety standards and airport security outside the US, especially in countries and airports that service US airlines as well as those that service non-US airlines with flights to the US.",

The GDP per capita of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries has a positive and significant impact on tourism demand in Izmir, Turkey while a stronger Turkish lira, using relative exchange rates against major currencies, has a negative and significant impact on tourist arrivals (\u00d6zlem \u00d6nder et al., 2009). Moreover, the GDP of the country of origin significantly and positively affects tourist arrivals to the Philippines while relative consumer price indices (CPIs) between the Philippines and the country of origin are insignificant (Deluna and Jeon, 2014). Bronner and de Hoog (2012) argue that during an economic crisis some tourists tend to economize on certain \u201caspects of a holiday\u201d rather than \u201cgiving up a holiday\u201d altogether, indicating that there are limits to the impact of income on tourism demand.",

We used the real exchange rate between the SGD and the Philippine peso (PHP) as proxy for the price competitiveness of tourism-related goods and services in the Philippines since the country competes with its neighbors for tourists and their expenditures. While the literature supports the use of CPIs as proxy for the price of goods and services that foreign visitors purchase, relative CPIs between the Philippines and the countries of origin of tourists are not significant in predicting international tourism to the Philippines (Deluna and Jeon, 2014). Moreover, CPIs cannot be used as proxy for the price competitiveness of tourism-related purchases in the Philippines because the government measures CPIs as \u201cchanges in the price level of goods and services that most [Filipino households purchase] for their day-to-day consumption\u201d (Sta. Ana and Varona, 2004). Since international tourism and tourism-related purchases are considered luxury items (Park et al., 2011), there is hardly any meaningful association between the tourist price index (TPI), which is not available, and what most Filipino households purchase for their daily consumption. Moreover, Lim (1997) reports that a number of \u201cresearchers argue that tourists respond to exchange rate movements when they make their decision to travel, because of limited knowledge\u201d on local prices and the prices of competing goods and services. Thus, the real exchange rate is a better proxy for the TPI as well as the price competitiveness of goods and services that tourists purchase in the Philippines and in competing destination countries.",

The real exchange rate variable, PHPSGD, a proxy for the TPI, impacts tourist expenditures, arrivals, and length of stay in two ways. A stronger SGD against the PHP should result in higher tourism demand since the relative prices of tourism-related activities in the Philippines have decreased, encouraging more travel to and tourism activities in the country.

The Newey-West estimator calculates consistent covariance matrices even when serial correlation and heteroskedasticity are present (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009, Johnston and DiNardo, 1997), while the GMM allows one to drop the assumption of homoskedasticity and apply White's estimator for heteroskedasticity of unknown form (Greene, 1997). The estimation method uses two-stage least squares coefficients with GMM standard errors using an optimal weighting matrix (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009), resulting in robust estimators and standard errors. Moreover, we used the fixed-effects model to estimate the econometric equations to control for any unobserved heterogeneity in the data and because the fixed-effects model yields robust estimators even when a number of time-invariant explanatory variables have not been included in the model (Johnston and DiNardo, 1997).",

This may be due to the difficulty of canceling or modifying travel plans at the last minute or the financial cost associated with trip cancelation or modification, especially for business trips and visits to relatives. As mentioned earlier, the impact of the downgrade and ban on tourist arrivals is moderated by the millions of ethnic Filipinos with foreign passports who travel to the Philippines regularly. The reverse sign may also be due to the absence of major air transport accidents in the Philippines in the year immediately before and following the downgrade and ban, giving foreign visitors the impression that Philippine carriers and the civil aviation industry are relatively safe. The results also indicate the resilience of the tourism industry in the Philippines despite lingering safety concerns on its civil aviation industry by international aviation safety organizations.
