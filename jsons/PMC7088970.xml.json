Hence, a plethora of literature is available regarding the impact of these factors on various aspects including economic growth, government spending, income distribution and environment (Harrison 1996; Tomiura 2007). However, there is a little known regarding the effect of trade openness and FDI on physical health. To our best knowledge, no published study has so far examined the dynamic relationships between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy by using long time series data. Hence, this study is a modest effort to narrow this gap by investigating the impact of trade openness and FDI on life expectancy using Pakistan as a case study during the period of 1972\u20132013.",

            "text": "Theoretically, it can be argued that there are numerous channels by which trade openness and FDI may affect health. First, there is a wide range of literature (Borensztein et al. 1998; Yanikkaya 2003) which argues that trade openness and FDI increase economic growth significantly. If trade openness and FDI are positively related to GDP per capita, it will be beneficial for life expectancy as higher income helps to afford better food and nutrition, housing, health care treatment and investment in better living and working conditions that significantly increase life expectancy. Second, trade openness and FDI positively affect education levels, including literacy level of household which in turn positively influences health and life expectancy. The third channel is the technology transfer effect from developed countries to developing ones since pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) is highly concentrated in a small group of developed countries that export these goods to the rest of the developing world (Papageorgiou et al. 2007). As many studies (e.g. Xu and Wang 2000; Ciruelos and Wang 2005) have found that trade openness and FDI are the means of technology diffusion, public health in a developing country can be improved through the increased access to new technologies for water sanitation, medical treatment and pharmaceuticals. Finally, trade openness may affect nutritional status both directly and indirectly through the increased imports of nutritional goods and services when an economy becomes more open.",

Moreover, increased trade openness and FDI inflows sometimes may have negative effects on the environment which may adversely impact population health (Owen and Wu 2007). Finally, globalization (particularly trade openness and FDI) and health can be also be adversely related through the effect of income inequality (Dreher and Gaston 2008; Bergh and Nilsson 2008).",

According to World Bank (2015), life expectancy (at birth) in Pakistan has improved significantly from 55 years in 1972 to 67 years in 2013. At the same time, the country has opened its economy and experienced a rapid growth in terms of trade. Furthermore, suffering various domestic and international wars, enormous political instability and the rise of numerous terrorist groups, Pakistan has managed to receive a large amount of FDI of US$1308 million in 2013 which is 78 times more than 1972. These points motivate us to examine the impact of trade openness and FDI on life expectancy in the case of Pakistan.",

First, this is the first study that employs long time series data to investigate the dynamic relationship between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy. Second, we apply both conventional and structural break unit root tests for examining the stationary properties of the variables. Third, in the presence of structural breaks, we employ the bounds testing approach to find whether cointegration exists or not and the robustness of cointegration is checked by applying combined cointegration. Fourth, the rolling-window approach is used for measuring the long-run impact of economic growth and FDI on life expectancy. Finally, the causal relationship between the variables is investigated by using the VECM Granger causality approach. The empirical results confirm the presence of cointegration amid the variables. The results also show that trade openness and FDI play positive roles in enhancing life expectancy. Finally, the unidirectional causality is found running from trade openness and FDI to life expectancy.",

Plenty of theoretical literature is available which argues that trade may have a significant positive impact on life expectancy in developing countries. For example, Romer (1989) is one of the pioneer studies which argues that trade openness facilitates interactions among the nations that increase the general flow of knowledge which helps domestic producers to enhance their productivity and economic growth. The higher economic growth helps to increase household income and promote better access to health facilities. Stark (2004) claims that trade openness increases education levels and raises consciousness of health among the mass people which contribute to the improvement of their life expectancy. Moreover, Deaton (2004) emphasizes that the closer integration of an economy improves public health as openness transmits health-related expertise and knowledge. Hawkes (2007) contends that trade liberalization declines the proportion of child and adult undernourishment as it allows greater availability of highly processed, calorie-rich and nutritious food in developing countries. However, Bezuneh and Yiheyis (2014) have challenged the findings of Hawkes (2007). From a panel data set of 37 developing countries, the study provides new evidence that trade liberalization has a negative effect on food availability which may have detrimental effects on public health in the case of developing countries.",

Wei and Wu (2002) is one of the pioneer studies that empirically explores the connection between trade openness and public health status. Considering a lower tariff rate as a proxy for trade openness, the study suggests that higher trade openness is linked to a longer life expectancy and a lower infant mortality rate. Levine and Rothman (2006) investigate whether openness to international trade affects children\u2019s health or not. They use cross-sectional data from 130 countries and report that trade openness helps to reduce infant mortality, child mortality and malnutrition. Subsequently, Owen and Wu (2007) examine the effect of trade on various health outcomes in a large panel data set of 219 countries across the world. From the fixed-effect model, the study provides empirical evidence that increased trade openness is related to lower rates of infant mortality and higher life expectancy, particularly in the case of developing countries. Moreover, they argue that trade openness is linked to sound economic policies which themselves are related to better health outcomes. Bussmann (2009) examines whether trade openness has any significant impact on health improvements in 134 countries. Using trade/GDP as a proxy for trade openness, their results fail to provide any evidence that trade openness has a significant positive impact on women\u2019s health and their life expectancy. However, this result might be questioned since the study has used interpolated data for missing years. As trade/GDP fluctuates from year to year, and changes in health outcomes likely evolve over a number of years, the interpolation is unlikely to capture any effects of trade on life expectancy.",

They employ the fixed-effect model and conclude that trade has a significant positive impact on population health in the low-income countries. However, their analysis finds that the relationship between income and health is nonlinear. The effect of trade openness on health decreases as income level increases and becomes negative at high levels of income. Trade openness is positively associated with income and health at a decreasing rate to a certain threshold and after that, it has no significant impact on public health. This finding is supported by arguing that trade openness could be harmful to health in high-income countries where higher income is associated with long working hours, more mental pressure, less sleep and increased consumption of unhealthy products. Very recently, Herzer (2015) analyses the long-run impact of trade openness on population health by applying cointegration techniques to the US time series data for the period 1960\u20132011. Using various time series techniques, the findings of the study suggest that trade has a positive and significant long-run impact on population health measured by life expectancy. Nevertheless, Lin et al. (2015) investigate whether trade reduces infant mortality in the case of least developing countries (LDC) during the period of 1995\u20132012. From a panel of 48 LDCs, the study finds that trade does not help to decrease child mortality. Indeed, the study reports that trade could even increase child mortality through raising environmental pollution.",

(2002) is one of the earlier studies which claims that FDI increases employment opportunities and improves working conditions that positively affect life expectancy of employees. Hawkes (2005) examines the role of FDI in nutrition transition particularly focusing on highly processed foods. Considering transnational food companies (TFCs) in developed countries as a sample, the study concludes that FDI plays a crucial role in nutrition transition by enabling and promoting the consumption of nutritional foods in developing countries. Outreville (2007) argues that FDI has a significant contribution to population health through improving health care sectors of developing countries. Recently, Herzer and Nunnenkamp (2012) explore the long-run impact of FDI on health status in a sample of 14 developed countries. Employing panel cointegration techniques, the study reveals that FDI has a significant and negative impact on improving health.",

For example, Ovaska and Takashima (2006) examine the effects of economic freedom on life expectancy. From a sample of 68 countries in the 1990s, the study finds that economic freedom plays an important role in increasing life expectancy. Stroup (2007) uses panel data to examine the relationship between the economic freedom index and life expectancy. Using various robust panel techniques, the study provides evidence that economic freedom is positively associated with life expectancy. Agreeing with Ovaska and Takashima (2006) and Stroup (2007), Pritchett and Summers (1996) claim that open economies have a higher life expectancy than restricted economies. Recently, Bergh and Nilsson (2010) analyze how globalization affects life expectancy in a panel of 92 countries during the period of 1972\u20132010. Using various estimation techniques and sample groups, the study reports that globalization has a robust impact on improving life expectancy.",

Ng and Perron (2001) have suggested that \u2018Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF)\u2019 and \u2018Philips and Perron (PP)\u2019 unit root tests suffer from severe size distribution properties when error term has negative moving-average root. When the root is close to \u22121, then the rejection rate can be as high as 100 %.1 Ng and Perron (2001) have proposed four tests utilizing GLS detrended data which are based on modified SIC and modified AIC, while DF/ADF, PP and DF-GLS unit root tests are based on non-modified information criteria. The calculated values of these tests are based on the forms of Philip-Perron\u2019s (1988) Za and Zt statistics, Bhargava\u2019s (1986) R1 statistics and the Elliot et al.\u2019s (1996) optimal best statistics. Therefore, we have utilized the Ng and Perron (2001) unit root test to examine the stationary level of the variables. Moreover, to ascertain the results of unit root properties, we have also used the Clemente et al. (1998) detrended structural break unit root test to identify the structural breaks in the series. The main advantage of Clemente et al. (1998) unit root test is that it provides information about two unknown structural break points in the series by offering two models which are (1) additive outliers (AO) and (2) innovational outliers (IO). The AO model informs about a sudden change in the mean of a series and the IO model indicates the gradual shift in the mean of the series. The additive outlier model is more suitable for the variables having sudden structural changes as compared to gradual shifts.",

(2000, 2001) is used with the help of an unrestricted vector error correction model to investigate the long-run relationship between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy. The ARDL approach has several advantages over other cointegration methods. The ARDL approach may apply irrespective of whether underlying variables are purely I(0), I(1) or mutually co-integrated.2 The approach also provides better empirical results for small sample.3 In the bounds testing approach, an estimation of results is even possible if the explanatory variables are endogenous.4 The ARDL model is developed for estimations as follow:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta e = \\omega_{0} + \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{p} {\\omega_{1} \\Delta e_{t - 1} } + \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{p} {\\omega_{2} \\Delta o_{t - 0} } + \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{p} {\\omega_{3} \\Delta f_{t - 1} } + \\gamma_{1} e_{t - 1} + \\gamma_{2} o_{t - 1} + \\gamma_{3} f_{t - 1} + \\mu_{t}$$\\end{document}\u0394e=\u03c90+\u2211i=1p\u03c91\u0394et-1+\u2211i=0p\u03c92\u0394ot-0+\u2211i=0p\u03c93\u0394ft-1+\u03b31et-1+\u03b32ot-1+\u03b33ft-1+\u03bctwhere \u03c9\n0 is constant and \u03bc\nt is a white noise error term, the error correction dynamics are denoted by the summation sign while the second part of the equation corresponds to long-run relationships. The Schwarz Bayesian Criteria (SBC) is used to identify the optimum lag of the model and each series. We first estimate F-statistic value by using the appropriate ARDL model. Secondly, the Wald (F-statistic) test is used to investigate the long-run relationship among the series. The null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected if the calculated F-test statistic exceeds the upper critical bound (UCB). The results are said to be inconclusive if the F-test statistic falls between the upper and lower critical bounds. Lastly, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is accepted if the F-statistic is below the lower critical bound. We have also used the ARDL cointegration model in the frames of structural break to analyze the relationship between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy. Moreover, we have also used the Bayer and Hanck (2013) cointegration analysis to validate the robust findings of ARDL cointegration methods. The Bayer and Hanck cointegration approach combines different tests (which ordinarily would have yielded different conclusions) into a single framework. The null hypothesis of no-cointegration of the most comprehensive Bayer and Hanck cointegration test is based on Engle and Granger (1987) and Banerjee et al. (1993) tests. The Bayer and Hanck (2013) test jointly determines test-statistics of Engle and Granger (1987) and Banerjee et al. (1993) tests. This cointegration approach combines the empirical results of various individual cointegration tests for comprehensive cointegration conclusions. We apply this cointegration approach to examine whether cointegration is present between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy in the case of Pakistan.",

These tests also fail to provide any information about the structural breaks occurring in the series. Therefore, to ascertain the structural breaks in the unit root properties, we have also uses Clemente et al. (1998) detrended structural break unit root test to identify the structural breaks in the series. Table 2 represents the results of Clemente et al. (1998) detrended structural break unit root test. As can be seen, all the variables are non-stationary at level with intercept and trend in presence of structural breaks. After first differencing, we find all variables are stationary. This confirms that series of all variables are integrated at I(1). Therefore, results of both unit root tests confirm the robustness of the unit root analysis.\n",

Therefore, we recommend that policy makers should introduce more trade liberalization and foreign investment friendly policies that will ensure the maximum economic and social benefits. We also suggest that the social benefits of trade and FDI will be more potent if the policy makers can ensure greater international trade and foreign investment particularly in the health sector. Hence, new developments of medical science including health care services and technologies should be traded without any tariff barriers.
