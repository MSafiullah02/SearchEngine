Getting a better understanding of the fraction of the population that has been infected with Covid-19 and of its lethality is of utmost importance for guiding further actions. This paper presents an analysis of publicly available random testing data and is aimed at providing information on the number of infections and the lethality of the novel corona virus. This is quantified as an infected fatality ratio (IFR). We perform this study as an exercise in data analysis, without attempting to interpret or modify reported numbers.

This averaging has likely not yet occured in many areas as we are still in the relatively early days of the pandemic, so that our results will not be truly representative in individual cases.

As a first step, we extract the relationship between the number of recorded deaths due to Covid-19 and the number of recorded infections. The number of recorded deaths follow a similar development as the number of recorded infections, but is clearly delayed in time. This can be seen in Fig. 3 where we show the results for Germany as an example. The number of deaths can be predicted from the number of infections by forecasting the number of deaths as a fraction of the number of infected cases and distributing these over a number of days. Mathematically, we predict the number of deaths on day T as: where i(t) is the number of recorded infections on day t, S is a scale factor to predict the number of deaths (the CFR), \u2206 quantifies a shift between the recorded infections and the recorded deaths, and \u03c3 D describes how the deaths are distributed and is given in days.

In order to extract an IFR that should represent an average over the full population, it is not sufficient that the random sampling represents the different population subgroups. Indeed, it is also important that the distribution of those infected in different population categories (age group, health conditions, ...) is known since there are strong correlations with these aspects of the population. If, e.g., the fraction of those infected in the upper age brackets is disproportionately high in a region related to one of the studies, then the extracted IFR from a random sampling of that population will also be high. This type of biasing must also be taken into account in extracting the final results. Some of the studies mentioned (see e.g. [8, 12] ) attempt to account for this type of biasing. We have not done so here, so that our results could potentially be biased due to this type of effect. Mathematically, we can represent the situation as follows:",

Even within a single region, the definition can change as is clearly seen in Fig. 6 , where spikes in the death count appear. These uncertainties should be propagated in our analysis. One mitigating factor is that we are using integrated values, such that short term fluctuations are averaged out. However, revised death counts are typically in the upward direction, so an upward shift of the median IFR value (currently below 0.3 % from the random testing data) is likely. For the extraction of our probability intervals, we have used the log-normal distribution for the IFR, which has a broad range and a tail to larger values.

It is not clear at which point antibodies will show up in significant amounts in the course of the infection, and the one week estimate in counting the development of antibodies and the number of deaths could be flawed. Taking the USA as an example, a one day change in the date at which deaths are counted would change the results by approximately 2.5 %. For cases where the infection was developing quickly, the number could be considerably higher. We therefore assume that changes in the number of deaths could certainly be wrong by 25 %.

The results of this study are shown in Fig. 9 (bottom).
