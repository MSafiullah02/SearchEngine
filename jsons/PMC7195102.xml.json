Isolated cardiovascular disease may be seen in approximately 2.5\u20135% of cases.19 The pathways leading to these manifestations include complex interplay of age, impaired immune system, and direct myocardial involvement via ACE2 in these patients.20 These pathways appear to be multifactorial and often bidirectional. As more international data emerge, potential relations between Cardio vascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19 will become clearer. Currently, diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on the use of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using upper and lower respiratory samples.21 However, newer and faster diagnostic kits are going to be available soon. Computed tomography of chest shows abnormality in >80% of patients with often subpleural and ground glass opacification and consolidation. However, this depends on the severity of infection.22 A large number of patients (>80%) have lymphocytopenia.12\n",

However, with the available evidence, it appears that the cardiovascular sequelae may range from direct or indirect myocardial injury (Fig. 1), myocarditis, possible acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.23\n,\n24 Elevated troponin levels have been observed in many patients with COVID-19, with significant differences between those who died and those who survived.25 In a meta-analysis of 4 studies, cardiac troponin I levels were much higher in those with severe disease than in those with nonsevere disease.25 Interestingly, the median Troponin I (TnI) among survivors did not change while it rose exponentially in nonsurvivors.26 Along with rise in troponins, other inflammatory biomarkers such as D dimers, interleukin-6, and so on also showed a significant increase reflecting severe pan-inflammatory response.20 Another group of patients presented with predominant cardiac symptoms mimicking viral myocarditis or acute coronary syndrome. Two cases recently reported highlight the possible direct effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. One patient27 presented with typical chest pain and ST elevation in ECG, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and positive troponins but nonobstructive coronary arteries. Another patient presented with severe myocarditis and severe LV dysfunction along with respiratory infection.28 Both the cases responded well to immunoglobulins and steroids with complete normalization of all parameters.",

            "text": "Cardiac arrhythmias have been noted in patients with COVID-19 but have not been characterized.29 Nonspecific palpitations are seen in approximately 7% of patients and arrhythmias in 16% of the hospitalized patients.29 Whether these arrhythmias are a direct manifestation of COVID-19 on the heart or are occurring because of metabolic disturbances, hypoxic injuries, or neurohormonal imbalance is still not clear.30 Because many of the drugs used in the management of this disease prolong the QT and corrected QT interval (QTc), there is a risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes and drug-induced sudden cardiac death, especially when multiple medications are administered. Therefore, QT calculation in ECG is mandatory when drugs are used and QTc >500 should to be taken as the upper limit. Patients infected with COVID-19 are likely at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Although there are no published case series thus far, there are reports of abnormal coagulation parameters in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) also have the potential to interact with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and can result in myopathy due to elevated statin levels when administered together. Similarly, heart failure has been described in almost 20% of cases, especially in those with underlying kidney disease.31 However, it is not clear whether it is because of direct myocardial injury or exacerbation of underlying LV dysfunction. Cardiogenic shock is seen as a feature in critically ill patients with COVID-19. More commonly, it is a spectrum of overlap between cardiac and primary pulmonary manifestation, thereby giving a mixed shock picture. Brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography can help in clarifying the diagnosis.32 It is important to ascertain the type to choose the mechanical respiratory or circulatory support with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation and so on. The utility of these support systems is still not well ascertained.33 Another concern is patients of heart transplantation presenting with COVID-19. In 2 such cases described,34 both presented with fever and had ground glass opacities in the lung. They responded well to treatment after management with antivirals and glucocorticoids. In a series of 87 patients, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with heart transplantation was not found to be higher.35 At present, it is not clear how COVID-19 is going to impact need and management of cardiac transplantation. More data are needed to draw definite conclusions in this regard. Further, if the recipient is negative for SARS-CoV-2 and has no prior exposure or symptoms in 2\u20134 weeks, it is currently recommended to continue heart transplantation without any change in regimens.36\n",

In patients with active COVID-19 presenting with ST elevation, myocardial infarction, and who are stable, fibrinolysis is a reasonable option. In case of urgent intention, for all staff directly involved in the procedure PPE should be worn, and powdered air-purifying respirators are reasonable. In patients requiring intubation, it should be ideally performed before arrival in the cath laboratory. It is recommended to use HEPA filters between tubes and bags.
