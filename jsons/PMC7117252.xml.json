The disease is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoV is a member of the family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus which is a group of enveloped and positive-stranded RNA viruses. Antigenically and genetically, coronaviruses are currently grouped into at least four groups. FCoV belongs to group I coronavirus which includes canine coronavirus (CCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E (Wege et al., 1982).",

It was demonstrated that FIPV arises inside of cats by mutation from infected FECV (Vennema et al., 1998).

In addition to this serological property, some other biological characteristics to each type have been described. While FCoV type I grows poorly in cell culture, type II can grow well in many different cell lines (Pedersen et al., 1984). Furthermore, type II FCoV shows close antigenic and genetic relationship to CCoV and TGEV, suggesting that FCoV type II arose from double recombination between FCoV type I and CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998)",

Alternatively CCoV or TGEV are also used as a target antigen because of serological close relations to FCoV.

M91-267 strain was isolated from the spleen sample taken at the postmortem examination of effusive form FIP case in 1991(Mochizuki et al., 1997). These two strains were classified into type II by using FCoV type-specific mAbs, kindly provided by Dr. T. Hohdatsu (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Hohdatsu et al., 1991b). C3663 strain was isolated from a cat with an effusive form of FIP in 1994 and used as a reference FCoV type I (Mochizuki et al., 1997). In addition, it was genetically confirmed that C3663 belongs to type I FCoV and M91-267 and KUK-H/L do to type II (manuscript in preparation). Yayoi strain was isolated from liver homogenate from non-effusive form of FIP by serial passage in suckling mouse brain and then in fcwf-4 cells and have been used as Japanese prototype strain of FCoV type I (Hayashi et al., 1981). C3663, KUK-H/L and M91-267 strains were used in subsequent experiments within 10 passages in fcwf-4 cells. Although the passage history of Yayoi strain is unknown, it was propagated less than three times in our laboratory.",

Four sera from FIPV type I infected cats showed VN titers to C3663 and Yayoi ranging from 1:1000 to 1:16000, and those to M91-267 and KUK-H/L ranging from <1:10 to 1:40 (Table 1\n). Sera collected from the experimentally FIPV type II infected cats had higher VN titers to type II ranging from 1:4000 to 1:128000 and lower VN titers to type I ranging from 1:80 to 1:1280 (Table 1). These results indicated that FCoV-infected cat sera had significantly higher VN titers to homologous type, but not to heterologous type. Therefore, this PRNT using both types of FCoV must be able to distinguish serologically between FCoV type I and II infections.",

Among these seropositive samples, 49 (98%) possessed significantly higher titers against type I, and only one (2%) did against type II. Although three samples had VN titers of 1:33 to type II, two of them had higher VN titers to type I (1:3333). Since one sample did not have VN titer to type I, it was regarded as positive for type II.

In Japan, Hohdatsu et al. (1992) first described that 21.3% of chronically diseased cats and 13.4% of non-diseased cats had antibodies to FCoV by IFA to detect FCoV infection. The seroprevalence rate obtained in the present study is about three times higher than that in the previous report. Since different methods and samples were used for epidemiology, it is impossible to directly compare the prevalence of FCoV in Japan. However, most probable explanation for this discrepancy is that FCoV has been widespreading among Japanese cat population during the last decade.",
