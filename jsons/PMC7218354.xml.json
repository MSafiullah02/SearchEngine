Many institutions have fashioned and employed guidelines regarding triaging patient care conditioned on the acuity of the otolaryngologic condition.7,8,10 Nevertheless, with a lack of complete understanding of COVID-19 and its impact, there is expected variability within these recommendations.",

This has allowed for fewer direct interactions in the setting of a global pandemic while still providing necessary acute care. In assessing this transition, we analyzed administrative records of our otolaryngology division\u2019s outpatient practice patterns during the first 4 weeks following hospital-wide aggressive COVID-19 policy changes\u2014March 16 to April 10, 2020\u2014and compared them with the corresponding period from 1 year prior.

Of the 2020 completed visits, 55.8% were via telehealth. In the corresponding 2019 period, no telehealth visits were completed (Figure 1A). Few comparable objective data have quantified the changes in outpatient practice to date. One health care technology company, Phreesia, collected and analyzed data from >50,000 physician clients from February 1 through April 16, 2020, utilizing practice management/scheduling software, check-in information provided by patients, and electronic medical records.20 Consistent with our findings, the COVID-19\u2013affected period saw a significant decline in outpatient visits from baseline. Interestingly, relative to other ambulatory practices, otolaryngology had the second-greatest decline of in-person visitations\u2014approximately 75%\u2014second only to ophthalmology (79%). As mentioned, concern for increased risk of transmission with close examination of the head and neck may contribute to this and would also apply to ophthalmology. In addition, a relatively large volume of elective, semielective, and nonurgent evaluations likely factors in, especially for the surgical subspecialties.",

Interestingly, in the first week, almost 55% of scheduled telehealth visits were not completed due to patient no-shows or leaving without being seen; however, by the fourth week, only 18% of visits were not completed for these reasons. Furthermore, by the end of the month, a larger percentage of 2020 scheduled telehealth visits were completed as compared with 2019 scheduled in-person visits (71.5% vs 62.0%, P < .001).

However, this drop was lowest among head and neck oncology patients, which may reflect a higher acuity in their pathology. Furthermore, telehealth utilization rates were highest in the pediatric and head and neck oncology subspecialties, though all specialties exhibited a trend of increasing telehealth usage over the course of 1 month (Figure 3A and 3B). While the precise reasoning for higher pediatric and head and neck oncology telehealth utilization rates is unclear, it should be noted that the Yale School of Medicine oversees outpatient visits for general and specialty otolaryngology, while Yale New Haven Hospital, a separate organization, manages the head and neck oncology and pediatric otolaryngology clinics. Another explanation may again include the acuity of care necessitating increased efforts to coordinate visits. Within pediatrics, preexisting comfort level with technology and telehealth among younger parents and teenagers may be a contributing factor. Not surprising, the total number of SLP and audiology visits dropped precipitously in 2020 as compared with 2019, and the majority of 2020 visits occurred in person. SLP and audiology represent fields in which patients are commonly referred for less acute pathologies and examinations are more difficult to perform remotely.",

Nonetheless, quantitative data can allow other institutions to glean useful information on possible transitioning methods and expected practice alterations. Continuing to monitor trends within health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. Consistent findings of increased in-person interaction among at-risk populations, for example, may promote innovative and useful action in the application of safe care. Furthermore, with a broader call for health care reform and universal access to affordable care, efficient use of resources, via patient triaging and telehealth, can have a profound impact beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.23",
