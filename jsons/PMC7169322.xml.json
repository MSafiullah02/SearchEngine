These lesions often have the ability to mimic a neoplastic process and frequently involve the orbital region. Pseudotumors and orbital pseudotumor have only rarely been reported in the veterinary literature. A lacrimal pseudotumor involving the lower lacrimal canaliculus has been reported in a dog.\n1\n In cats, a case of idiopathic orbital pseudotumor has been described, which was characterized by fibrosis, whereas a case of exophthalmia has also been reported associated with eosinophilic infiltration of the orbit.\n2\n, \n3\n\n",

The predominance of a polymorphous cellular infiltrate composed of mature lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is often considered indicative of a more acute presentation. In comparison, subacute and chronic forms of orbital pseudotumors are characterized by the formation of increasing amounts of fibrovascular stroma (fibrosclerosis).",

Of most use in diagnosis was imaging of the orbit as well as history and familiarity with the disease presentation. No evidence of systemic disease was identified in the cats included in the current study. Although a complete postmortem examination was only permitted in one cat, the clinical and histological findings did not support a diagnosis of malignancy or microbial infection in the cases presented in this report.

In particular, herpes zoster and herpes simplex I viruses have been associated with upper respiratory tract infection in a subgroup of patients presenting with orbital pseudotumor.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n Feline equivalents of herpes simplex virus occur and two of the cats in this report exhibited signs of an upper respiratory tract infection prior to the onset of their clinical orbital signs, whereas a third cat developed respiratory signs following initial diagnosis. Each of these three cats had or subsequently developed gingival involvement. A viral infection in these cats, possibly FHV, could initiate the same cascade of events seen in humans although efforts to identify FHV were unsuccessful. It is difficult to isolate FHV in infected cats and it is impossible to exclude a viral etiology or virally associated pathogenesis with the small numbers in this study. Further studies are warranted to determine whether prior conditions such as FHV infection may lead to tissue fibrosis.",

It has been compared to other primary fibrosing disorders, including retroperitoneal fibrosis and Riedel's thyroiditis, rather than representing progression of acute or subacute nonspecific orbital inflammation. The proposed pathogenesis is exaggerated proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix by fibrogenic cytokines, in particular transforming growth factor \u03b2.\n5\n, \n12\n, \n21\n Aggregates of inflammatory cells were present in orbital biopsy samples in the current study in cats; however, it is unknown whether widespread inflammation of orbital tissues preceded fibrosis, or whether, as in humans, the fibrosis is a suspected primary lesion. Given the similarity in the clinicopathologic findings to idiopathic sclerosing pseudotumor in humans, a primary fibrosis must be considered as a potential cause of the condition in cats.",

However, eosinophilic major basic protein has been reported to predominate over infiltration by intact eosinophils in human cases with increased amounts of fibrous tissue.\n8\n Therefore, infiltration by eosinophils and subsequent degranulation may occur in the cat, leading to extensive fibrosis in the absence of intact eosinophils.

The nictitans is similar histologically to lacrimal gland and affected tissue had evidence of focal inflammation and extensive fibrosis.

In comparison in the current study in cats, only one case was reported to have an absent pupillary light reflex and vision loss in the affected eye. In this cat, vision loss was attributed to a total retinal detachment histologically. Partial retinal detachment was also observed in three other eye specimens, potentially a result of scleral compression and local disruption of transretinal fluid flow. It is perhaps surprising that more cats in the current study were not reported with visual impairment. However, visual assessment is difficult in cats and it is possible that subtle visual and pupillary deficits may have gone undetected. Certainly, the constricting nature of the sclerosis and posterior pole location could have also caused visual deficits from optic nerve compression without clinically detectable pupillary deficits.",

One case also received local radiation therapy. All treatments appeared to have little or no effect on the course of the disease in cats. This poor effect may reflect the institution of treatment after the disease process was well entrenched and difficult to reverse, although only anti\u2010inflammatory doses of corticosteroids were used. The grave prognosis and poor response to treatment indicate the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive management. Immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids or use of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, should be considered.",

Accurate diagnosis of this disorder and further attempts to identify underlying pathogens such as FHV, autoimmune disorders, and aberrant production of fibrogenic cytokines (e.g., fibroblast growth factor, TGF\u2010\u03b2) will contribute to defining this disease in the cat.
