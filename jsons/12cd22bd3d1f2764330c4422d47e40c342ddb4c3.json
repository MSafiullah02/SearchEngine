The disease has been reproduced experimentally only in chimpanzees and marmosets [4, 5] . As regards the lower old-world monkeys, the view is held that they are subject to an asymptomatic infection, accompanied only by seroconversion [8] . Clinical and morphological manifestations of the disease have not been described in these monkeys, whether due to natural or to experimental infection [6, ii] . Meanwhile long experience of the study of spontaneous pathology of the lower old-world monkeys, kept in the Sukhumi nursery, has demonstrated that they are prone to liver lesions very similar in their morphological characteristics to human virus hepatitis. The frequency of these attacks of hepatitis have increased considerably in the last 5 years.",

In the three species of monkeys studied, the disease most closely resembled in its course human hepatitis A in rhesus monkeys. The virus found in lower old-world monkeys has antigenic and morphological similarity with human HVA. On infection of Javanese macaques with this virus, a disease with the clinical and morphological manifestations typical of hepatitis A was produced. Further investigations will show whether or not this agent is identical with human HVA, or whether it is a virus peculiar to monkeys. Irrespective of the origin of the virus, experimental hepatitis A in macaques may be used as a model with which to test vaccines against human hepatitis A.",
