COVID-19 is estimated to have a case fatality rate of 2-3%, but a wide range of mortality rates between 0.2 and 8% has been reported, likely reflecting variable background implementation of public health interventions [3]. The outbreak is expected to infect a large portion of the world population [4], and a case fatality rate of 1-3% represents a significant mortality and healthcare burden [5]. The long-term pulmonary complications in individuals who recover from moderate and severe COVID-19 infections remain unclear [6].",

The severe presentations with often fatal outcomes have consistently been associated with several comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and advanced age [7]. There is likely an immunologic explanation, given our current understanding of weakened immune system in diabetics and individuals with advanced age. It is not clear whether dialysis-dependent patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at greater risk for severe disease manifestations and poorer outcomes. We present a case of COVID-19 in the United States in a long-term dialysis-dependent ESRD patient reported thus far in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.",

He was initiated on antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Over the next 24 h, he was febrile to 101\u00b0F and respiratory status rapidly deteriorated. His repeat chest X-rays demonstrated evolution of the bilateral multifocal opacities consistent with the atypical pneumonia, and there was concern for superimposed pulmonary edema. He underwent dialysis the evening of hospital day 2; he tolerated the treatment poorly, developing new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate despite only minimal ultrafiltration. His respiratory condition continued to rapidly decline during the night, and he had to be intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. His pulmonary condition continued to deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring continued mechanical ventilation with high PEEP >10 cm and FiO2 >60% as well as pressor support. In an effort to maintain close control of his volume status and metabolic parameters, we have initiated him on continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. In the setting of ESRD, he has been deemed not a candidate for remdesivir compassionate use trial and was started on hydroxychloroquine and on hospital day 6 he was started on tocilizumab given continued hemodynamic instability with elevated inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6. With the inability to rule out superimposed infection he has also been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactom since hospital day 6. His clinical course is being followed closely by a multispecialist team, and depending on his trajectory, he may require paralysis as well as more aggressive pulmonary and hemodynamic support with proning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. At the current time, his vasopressor requirement remains variable, as does his PaO2/FiO2 ratio, while he remains in critical condition for the past 5 days. Table 1 summarizes timeline.

[8], clinical characteristics of 21 patients including 2 long-term dialysis admitted to an ICU in Washington State were described. A unique feature of our reported case is the potentially long incubation period, assuming this patient contracted the infection in South Korea in early January 2020, which was 6 weeks prior to the first presentation, but we cannot be certain. Alternatively he could be one of the first community spread cases identified in southern California. The delayed diagnosis for the first 5 days was likely because it was not recognized by the treating centers that gastrointestinal manifestation may be a part of COVID-19 infection. Our reported dialysis-dependent patient is notably healthier and younger than the average dialysis patients in the United States and without diabetes but with a history of hypertension and cardiac disease. Yet, he developed ARDS and has required ventilatory support. This case report highlights the importance of considering COVID-19 infection in a variety of clinical presentation that may not initially include typical respiratory symptom to prevent ongoing exposure of potentially affected individuals to the general population. It also highlights the need for rapidly available testing for all patients who present to healthcare setting with even nonsevere and atypical symptoms. This patient with community spread disease traveled from Southern California to Utah for 2 days using public airports, commercial flights, and public transportation, potential exposures which could have been avoided if testing supplies and public health recommendations would have been different. The consequences of this exposure remain unclear, but the United States has since had a rapidly increasing number of cases.",

Notably, however, the first case of COVID-19 infection confirmed in the United States reported a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting on admission followed by loose stools on hospital day 2 [9], and COVID-19 viral nucleic acids of loose stool and respiratory specimens were reported positive. In a recent report from Hubei, China, 204 COVID-19-infected patients were studied, and the authors reported that digestive symptoms are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 [10]. Patients who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms had a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Hence, clinicians including nephrologists should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be among the presenting features of COVID-19 infection, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms [10].",

Prior studies suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding capacity is strongly associated with coronavirus infectivity and disease severity. ACE2 may be differentially upregulated by ACEi, ARB, and aldosterone antagonists [12, 13, 14]. It is postulated that the expression of ACE2 may be increased with the use of ACEi, ARB, and aldosterone antagonists, particularly in diabetic patients, and therefore it has been suggested that increased expression of ACE2 may facilitate infection by COVID-19. It is important to note, however, that higher ACE2 levels have been shown to have a protective effect against acute lung injury and reduce progression of lung injury to ARDS in animal studies. As a result, there are ongoing investigations for ACE2 as potential new therapy for inflammatory lung disease [15]. ACE2 has been noted to decrease with age, and COVID-19 has consistently demonstrated higher mortality and morbidity in the older population. Figure 2 shows the pathophysiological interplay between viral entry and lung physiology centered around ACE2.",
