Blood gas analysis was significant for hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. Chest X-ray showed multifocal infiltrates. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia of 103 beats/minute. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID 19. The patient was started on azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and ceftriaxone. On Day 5 of hospitalization, the patient reported sudden-onset severe pain in the right arm. A Doppler ultrasound showed echogenic material (intraluminal thrombus) within the right brachial and radial artery. Computed tomography angiogram showed a nonocclusive thrombus of the right brachiocephalic trunk, occlusive thrombus with the axillary artery with reconstituted flow in the diminutive brachial artery extending to the radial, proximal ulnar and interosseous arteries, and incomplete visualization of the distal ulnar artery (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for intracardiac thrombus and ejection fraction was 55-60%. The patient was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin and underwent open thromboembolectomy of the right brachiocephalic, subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, ulnar arteries and endarterectomy of the right brachial artery. Post embolectomy, patient had palpable right radial and ulnar pulses with normal sensation and motor function. The patient was maintained on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) post procedure. Unfortunately, the patient had a cardiopulmonary arrest due to persistent hypoxemia during hospitalization and passed away.",
