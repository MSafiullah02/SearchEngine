A recent fiscal-year report from the USDA indicates that 172 498 hamsters were used in 2007. Although the hamster still makes a significant contribution to research and teaching, the number of hamsters utilized currently is well below their peak usage of over 500 000 achieved during the 1980s (Hankenson and Van Hoosier, 2002). Much of this decline is likely attributable to the availability and widespread use of genetically engineered mice. Despite this decline, the hamster still provides key data for a variety of research areas. As such, this chapter will focus primarily on the most current research uses of the hamster. More classical uses will be covered only as they pertain to these current uses.",

The hamster\u2019s relative size also allows for better visualization of certain biological systems including the respiratory and reproductive systems when compared to the mouse (Magers et al., 1995). Additionally, hamsters are relatively free of pathogens yet they are naturally susceptible to a wide range of experimental pathogens (Hankenson and Van Hoosier, 2002). Further, laboratory hamsters develop a variety of inherited diseases which display similarities to human conditions. Hamsters possessing some of these inherited traits are commercially available (Biobreeders Inc. Watertown, MA; Table 34.1\n). In addition to these benefits, hamsters are susceptible to a variety of carcinogens and develop tumors that other research animals less commonly develop. Furthermore, hamsters are susceptible to the induction of a variety of metabolic disorders through the use of dietary manipulations. Finally, the antagonistic nature of hamsters is utilized to study the effect of treatment on male aggressive and defensive behaviors.",

            "text": "Pancreatic tumors of non-endocrine origin are particularly aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis in humans (Uchida et al., 2008). The most common anatomic form of this tumor is ductular adenocarcinoma. The Syrian hamster is used extensively to study this tumor. Most commonly, the tumors are induced by the administration of nitrosamines (particularly N-nitrosobis amine) as a single subcutaneous injection. The resulting tumor is both morphologically and biologically similar to human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Uchida et al., 2008). One of the limitations of this model is the prolonged time-course for tumor induction (as long as 51 weeks). This time-course can be expedited by giving multiple nitrosamine injections (Konishi et al., 1998). Additional limiting factors of the model are the incomplete penetrance of tumor formation even with multiple injections and the low rate of tumor metastasis (Konishi et al., 1998, Mizumoto et al., 1990). Environmental factors, including a choline-deficient diet, given in combination with nitrosamines produce tumors more rapidly and with a greater prevalence in both male and female hamsters (Mizumoto et al., 1988, Mizumoto et al., 1989a, Mizumoto et al., 1989b).",

Specifically, chemicals and biologics with the potential to prevent cancer can be given synchronously or shortly after carcinogen administration, and effectiveness in cancer reduction (both tumor size and prevalence) can be assessed phenotypically at specified time points. Utilizing this general scheme several potential anti-cancer compounds were identified, including dimethylamino-parthenolide, celecoxib, iNOS inhibitors, and melatonin (Ruiz-Rabelo et al., 2007, Takahashi et al., 2008, Yip-Schneider et al., 2008). Alternatively, studies can be carried out after induction to determine the efficacy of tumor treatment and metastasis prevention. This approach recently demonstrated that somatostatin analogs are able to decrease metastasis of pancreatic cancers (Kilian et al., 2009).",

A variety of other biological behaviors can be induced with this transplantable model. Specifically, if the cell line is injected into the pancreas, hamsters develop pancreatic cancer which metastasizes to the liver whereas splenic injection induces direct metastasis to the liver, and intraperitoneal injection induces dissemination to the entire peritoneal cavity (Uchida et al., 2008). Therefore, this model can be used to study the primary disease, metastasis, and dissemination in a rapid fashion. An additional benefit of the transplant model is that it is characterized molecularly and is known to contain mutations of k-ras, Vegf, and matrix metalloproteinases similar to human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (Matsushita et al., 2001).",

One method to induce lung tumors is to inject the carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) subcutaneously (Sunday et al., 1995). Multiple injections must be given over a prolonged (6 months or longer) time course. Modifications to this induction protocol include the use of hyperoxia in conjunction with the carcinogen treatment (Oreffo et al., 1993). Presumably, the addition of hyperoxia increases the potential for free-radical damage to DNA of the lung tissue. The NNK model displays molecular characteristics of human NSCLC including mutations in the k-ras gene (Oreffo et al., 1992, Oreffo et al., 1993). A thorough immunohistochemical characterization of both the chemical model and the chemical plus hyperoxia model indicates that both experimental paradigms induce similar lung lesions that display strong similarity to human NSCLC at the protein level (Sunday et al., 1995).",

These tumors are induced by inhalation or topical application of carcinogens with or without the addition of co-carcinogenic stimuli (Estensen et al., 2007, Homburger et al., 1979, Moon et al., 1992a, Moon et al., 1992b). A reported limitation of topical carcinogen application models is the lack of reproducibility among different labs (Estensen et al., 2007). It is unclear why various labs are unable to faithfully reproduce the cancer phenotype using the same protocols; however, one possibility is that because the hamsters came from different sources, they may be genetically different. To overcome this limitation, a recent publication describes combining the administration of N-methylnitrosourea (MNU) with direct wounding of the tissue (Estensen et al., 2007). The experimental design includes two tracheal wounding procedures done under general anesthesia. The trachea is gently abraded using a curette and this abrasion is coupled with six applications of MNU using a gavage needle. The induction of the wound induces epithelial proliferation which acts epigenetically in conjuction with the genotoxic mutagen to promote carcinogenesis. A benefit of this model is the coinduction of esophageal tumors which mimics the epidemiological linkage of these two tumor types in human smokers (Wattenberg et al., 2004). The model can be altered to incorporate preventative and post-induction treatments. Utilizing this paradigm, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; a mitosis inhibitor) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; a DNA replication inhibitor) treatments were both found to reduce the prevalence of tumor formation in hamsters (Wattenberg et al., 2004).",

The hamster cheek-pouch carcinogenesis model is one of the most accepted animal models to study oral tumor formation and progression (Vairaktaris et al., 2007, Vairaktaris et al., 2008a, Vairaktaris et al., 2008b). Carcinogens, most notably 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), administered by repeated topical application to the buccal pouch, induces carcinomas rapidly (~14 weeks) (Vairaktaris et al., 2008b). The DMBA administration technique is simple and involves anesthetizing the hamsters and brushing the desired carcinogen onto the buccal surface of the cheek pouch. Importantly, oncogenesis can be assayed in vivo or the transformed cells can be grown ex vivo (Wong et al., 1988).",

First, hyperkeratosis develops followed rapidly by hyperplasia and dysplasia. Finally, these lesions progress to invasive carcinomas (Vairaktaris et al., 2008b). Cellular and molecular alterations that occur during these predictable stages of tumorigenesis are extensively characterized (Vairaktaris et al., 2007, Vairaktaris et al., 2008b). The cellular and molecular alterations in the hamster display many similarities to human OSCC. Early in the disease, tyrosine kinase receptors are highly expressed in hamsters similar to the increase of the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase noted in humans (Werkmeister et al., 2000). Additionally, the oncogenes p53 and c-myc are highly expressed early in hamster tumorigenesis and there is a loss of expression of the p16 tumor suppressor gene during the early dysplastic stage (Papakosta et al., 2006, Vairaktaris et al., 2007). More recently, the microRNA expression profile of the DMBA-treated hamster cheek pouch has been analyzed and compared to normal cells. Treated cells display a unique microRNA profile distinct from normal tissue (Yu et al., 2009). These data imply that microRNA may play a role in the formation and progression of hamster check pouch tumors. The similarities of these new data to the human disease are not yet known.",

Since the hamster cheek pouch undergoes a predictable pathway of induced oncogenesis, these studies can be accurately timed to the appropriate tumor stage or pre-cancerous lesion.

These data led to the hypothesis that tumorigenic estrogens mediate carcinogenicity, at least in part, through their metabolic breakdown products (Liehr, 1997). In particular, estrogen is broken down to 4-hydroxyestrogen, a catecholestrogen, in the hamster kidney (Dwivedy et al., 1992, Liehr, 1997). This intermediate can be further broken down into quinones which cause DNA damage by forming DNA adducts. This pathway, initially characterized in the hamster, was later identified in women with breast cancer. Specifically, the \u201cnormal\u201d breast tissue of women with breast cancer displays higher levels of quinones when compared to unaffected controls (Li et al., 1994, Rogan et al., 2003). The estrogen receptor may be actively involved in tumor formation by shuttling quinone directly to nuclear DNA (Bolton and Thatcher, 2008).",

Since the breakdown products of estrogen can damage DNA (mutation), and estrogen itself can promote cell growth (proliferation), all of the necessary components of carcinogenesis are present in the estrogen-treated hamster kidney (Liehr, 1997). The administration of some estrogenic compounds does not damage DNA because toxic metabolic byproducts are not generated (Bhat et al., 2003). Cancer induction with these compounds can be rescued by inducing oxidative stress while administering these normally non-oncogenic estrogens. This finding highlights the need for both the proliferative and the DNA-damaging aspects of estrogen to produce tumors.

Tumor reduction at both the primary site, and the site of metastasis, was then analyzed. The investigators found that adenovirus inhibits primary tumor growth and metastasis and may promote survival (depending on tumor type injected). The virus is capable of replicating in the liver, lungs, and tumor tissues of the hamster following instillation and distribution in the blood (Thomas et al., 2006b). This experimental paradigm can be expanded to examine the treatment of a variety of tumors in the hamster and potential toxicities associated with the use of these viruses (Dhar et al., 2009, Lichtenstein et al., 2009). A further modification of this method is immunosuppression of hamsters with cyclophosphamide which allows for sustained adenoviral replication and oncolysis (Thomas et al., 2008).

            "text": "Cholesterol cholelithiasis is a significant health problem worldwide. The prevalence of this condition is three times higher in women than in men and increases regularly with age (Capron, 1994). The Syrian hamster is commonly used as a model for this condition which can be induced by excess dietary cholesterol (Cohen et al., 1989, Trautwein et al., 1999) or sucrose (Khallou et al., 1991a). The metabolism of cholesterol in the hamster is similar to humans (Khallou et al., 1991b). The nature and composition of hydrophobic bile salts and the ratio of taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile salts are similar in hamsters and humans (Figure 34.1\n) (Combettes-Souverain et al., 2002, Hardison, 1983, Singhal et al., 1983). In earlier studies, gallstones were induced in Syrian hamsters by feeding a fat-free glucose-rich diet (Dam, 1971). Diet models have evolved to include elevated levels of butterfat (Cohen et al., 1992, Hayes et al., 1992, Holzbach, 1984). In hamsters, the butterfat-diet induces a high cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in bile which promotes cholesterol cholelithiasis. In contrast, diets rich in safflower oil induce phospholipid secretion and reduce the lithogenicity of bile, thereby inhibiting cholesterol gallstones (Ohshima et al., 1996a).",

In contrast to humans, female hamsters are less susceptible to gallstones because they maintain more favorable biliary lipid and bile acid profiles (predominantly glycocholate) characterized by lower molar percentages of cholesterol and chenodeoxycholate (Ayyad et al., 1993, Trautwein et al., 1999). Dietary administration of androgens to female hamsters on a lithogenic diet (0.3% cholesterol) induces cholesterol gallstones at a comparable rate to induction in males fed a similar diet. In these androgen-treated, cholesterol-fed female hamsters, chenodeoxycholate increases while cholate decreases (Ayyad et al., 1995). Furthermore, castrated male hamsters on the lithogenic diet do not form cholesterol gallstones, and maintain a higher ratio of biliary cholate to chenodeoxycholate as compared to uncastrated males (Ohshima et al., 1996b).",

In LPN hamsters, the sucrose-rich lithogenic diet causes an increase in biliary cholesterol and phospholipid. A cholesterol-enriched diet results in hypercholesterolemia, increased liver cholesterol, and reduced cholesterologenesis along with expression of the LDL receptor in both LPN and JAN hamsters (Souidi et al., 2001). In both strains, the cholesterol-enriched diet increases the cholesterol content in both the LDL and HDL fractions of sera (Souidi et al., 2001, Woollett et al., 1997). Further, excess dietary cholesterol leads to a reduction of CYP7A (the rate-limiting enzyme in the classical pathway of cholesterol breakdown to bile salts) activity and transcription in both LPN and JAN hamsters (Souidi et al., 2001). There is a concurrent stimulation of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) and oxysterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7B), enzymes involved in the alternative bile-salt pathway of cholesterol conversion to bile salts in both LPN and JAN hamsters. Compared with LPN hamsters, hypercholesterolemia in JAN hamsters is associated with hepatomegaly and fatty liver but only modest hypertriglyceridemia. Interestingly, after cholesterol feeding for 5 weeks, neither LPN nor JAN hamsters develop cholesterol gallstones, perhaps because of the upregulation of the alternative pathway of bile-salt synthesis (Souidi et al., 2001).",

Fructose feeding for a 2-week period induces significant hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia (Taghibiglou et al., 2000). Plasma hepatic lipase activity, and hepatocyte hepatic lipase concentration and mRNA levels are increased in these hamsters (Lewis et al., 2004). Activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) by the addition of chenodeoxycholic acid in high-fructose-diet-fed hamsters reduces plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, mainly by decreasing de novo lipogenesis and hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Bilz et al., 2006).

Chemical agents such as alloxan or streptozotocin (STZ) are commonly used to induce diabetes in animal models. To induce chronic diabetes in hamsters, STZ is more effective and reliable when compared to alloxan (Phares, 1980). STZ depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in pancreatic \u03b2-cells leading to necrosis (Ar\u2019Rajab and Ahren, 1993). Furthermore, type 2 diabetes can be induced by administration of STZ to hamsters on a high-fat diet, resulting in an increase in serum lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and fasting plasma insulin level (Zhu et al., 2007). Another described method to induce type 2 diabetes in hamsters is to inject nicotinamide intraperitoneally 15 minutes before administration of STZ (Fararh et al., 2002). Nicotinamide provides partial protection against the beta-cytotoxic effect of STZ resulting in partial (40%) preservation of pancreatic insulin stores (Masiello et al., 1998). Dietary modifications alone, such as feeding high-fat (15%) diets containing modest cholesterol (0.12%) to hamsters, induce type 2 diabetes as well as obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia (van Heek et al., 2001). A combined hyperlipidemia and diabetes hamster model is induced by feeding a fat-rich diet (3% cholesterol and 15% butter fat) and a single IP injection of STZ. These animals exhibit pathobiochemical changes characteristic of both diabetes and hyperlipemia and show an earlier and more severe induction of diabetic and hyperlipidemic changes compared to either STZ or high-fat diet alone (Simionescu et al., 1996).",

Hamsters are a good animal model to investigate cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis because they possess similar lipid metabolism to humans (Asami et al., 1999, Foxall et al., 1992). As in humans, the main plasma cholesterol carrier in hamsters is LDL (Sullivan et al., 1993). The hamster LDL receptor gene shows strong sequence and structural similarities to the human gene (Bishop, 1992). Unlike mice and rats, which lack cholesterol ester transfer protein, hamsters exhibit all enzymatic pathways in lipoprotein and bile metabolism that are present in humans (Bishop, 1992). The low basal rates of bile acid and cholesterol synthesis, coupled with a lack of CYP7A induction by cholesterol, render the hamster much more sensitive than the rat or mouse to the cholesterolemic effects of excess dietary cholesterol (Horton et al., 1995). In contrast to mice and rats, apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 is exclusively of intestinal origin in hamsters and humans and apoB-100 is exclusively of hepatic origin (Arbeeny et al., 1992, Ebara et al., 1994).",

Hypercholesterolemic (0.05% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil) diet-induced atherosclerosis in susceptible hamsters is confined initially to the inner curvature of the aortic arch. Atherogenesis in this region is characterized by the infiltration of monocytes, which become lipid-filled foam cells (Kowala et al., 1991a). Male hamsters on a hyperlipidemic diet (3% cholesterol and 15% butter fat) develop coronary atherosclerotic lesions which are very similar to lesions seen in humans (Sima et al., 1990). Interestingly, hyperglycemia alone in hamsters induces atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries, aortic arch, and aortic valves, implying that the hyperglycemic hamster could provide a model of diabetes-induced atherosclerosis (Sima et al., 1997).",

Epidemiological studies demonstrate that women who smoke cigarettes experience increased rates of reproductive problems, including delay to conception, ectopic pregnancies, lower birth weights, and spontaneous abortions (DiCarlantonio and Talbot, 1999, Magers et al., 1995). Syrian hamsters are a prominent rodent used in female reproductive toxicology inhalation studies including mainstream (MS) smoke (active inhalation of a bolus of smoke) and side-stream (SS) smoke (passive inhalation of smoke). Advantages of hamsters in these studies are that they adapt well to smoking machines and they have reproductive tracts that are large enough to allow thorough evaluation (Magers et al., 1995).",

            "text": "To test the effects of smoke inhalation on reproductive parameters, female Syrian hamsters in various stages of estrous or pregnancy are anesthetized, placed in dorsal recumbency, and exposed through a nose cone to smoke released from the burning end of a cigarette (SS smoke) or to a puff of MS smoke with a puffer box (Magers et al., 1995). A machine of equivalent design that pumps fresh air is used for control animals. Exposure to doses of MS and SS smoke equivalent to those in women who smoke actively or passively (second-hand smoke) is ensured by quantifying serum levels of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine (DiCarlantonio and Talbot, 1999). The major downfall of this technique is that it exposes females to either MS or SS smoke, but not to both, as would be the case for an active human smoker (Magers et al., 1995). Female hamsters that inhale either MS or SS smoke twice per day for 7 days, starting 1 month prior to mating and ending at day 7 of pregnancy, develop fewer corpus lutea (CL) with accompanying decreases in CL vascularity (Magers et al., 1995). Additional changes in these hamsters include blebbing of ciliated epithelial cells in oviducts, increases in secretory cells of the ampulla, decreases in the ability of the uterus to stretch, and crowding of fetuses. Functionally, the transport of preimplantation embryos through the oviduct is retarded, and oviduct muscle contraction rate is greatly decreased by smoke inhalation (DiCarlantonio and Talbot, 1999). Transport rate is more significantly retarded in the SS exposure group, suggesting that SS smoke exposure is more detrimental than MS smoke exposure with regard to embryo transport. Inappropriate transport and implantation could explain the increase in ectopic pregnancy in human smokers. Interestingly, when mating is delayed for 1 month following smoke inhalation, all deleterious effects of MS and SS exposure are ablated (Magers et al., 1995). This indicates that the female reproductive tract can quickly recover from the negative effects of smoke inhalation.",

Elastase is used as an induction agent because it destroys or impairs the formation of elastin, resulting in emphysema (Soskel et al., 1984). The elastase induction model reproducibly results in alveolar damage and destruction of alveolar septa resulting in airway enlargement, and causes lung hyper-inflation, all of which are seen in humans with COPD (Borzone et al., 2007, Hayes et al., 1977). Additionally, elastase-treated hamsters do not gain weight at a normal rate, which is analogous to the weight loss seen in humans with emphysema (Snider and Sherter, 1977). Syrian hamsters are also used as a model for emphysema treatment. Intratracheal instillation of hyaluronic acid in hamsters with elastase-induced emphysema reduces emphysema by binding with and protecting elastic fibers from elastase-induced injury, and may be useful in preventing emphysema (Cantor et al., 1997, Cantor et al., 2002).",

Copper deficiency results in the inhibition of lysyl oxidase-mediated elastin cross-linking, causing impaired elastin formation and emphysema (Soskel et al., 1984). Also, since superoxide dismutase requires copper, copper deficiency leads to free radical accumulation which can cleave elastin bonds and attract inflammatory cells to the lung exacerbating emphysema.",

A single intratracheal installation of approximately 5 mg/kg body weight produces pulmonary fibrosis within 7 days (Lazo et al., 1990). Importantly, other organs are unaffected by this treatment and the treatment induces biochemical, inflammatory, and histological changes similar to those seen in the lungs of humans with IPF (Giri et al., 1994, Thrall et al., 1979, Wang et al., 2002). The bleomycin model of IPF involves an initial injury to the lung, followed by an influx of inflammatory cells that release cytokines (i.e. IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, PDGF, and TGF-\u03b2), leading to increased collagen synthesis and deposition (Iyer et al., 1999). A drawback of this model is that it produces high mortality in Syrian hamsters (Giri et al., 1994, Lazo et al., 1990). A refinement is the three-dose bleomycin hamster model where IPF is produced by the intratracheal instillation of three lower doses of bleomycin into the lungs of anesthetized hamsters at weekly intervals (Giri et al., 1994, Wang et al., 2002). This model uses repeated insults on the lung to initiate and sustain the fibroproliferative stage of fibrosis, and is the closest model to human IPF because it provides a multi-hit stimulus for lung injury, causing the slow development of IPF (Wang et al., 2002). There is age-selective resistance to bleomycin in young hamsters due to enhanced antioxidant defenses and bleomycin hydrolase activity in neonates (Lazo et al., 1990).",

Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of excessive extracellular matrix (i.e. collagen) production resulting in IPF (Iyer et al., 1999, Lazo et al., 1990). TGF-\u03b2 mRNA and protein levels are increased in fibrotic hamster lungs; therefore, suppressing its production constitutes a rational therapeutic approach (Iyer et al., 1999, Lazo et al., 1990, Wang et al., 2002). Decorin, a proteoglycan component of collagen fibrils, binds and inactivates all isoforms of TGF-\u03b2, offering a potential treatment for IPF (Giri et al., 1997). The antifibrotic drug pirfenidone down-regulates the bleomycin-induced overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 in the lungs, and pirfenidone is now a clinical therapeutic agent for IPF in humans (Antoniu, 2006, Bhatt et al., 2006, Iyer et al., 1999). Further, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, TGF-\u03b2 chimeric soluble receptor, causes significant reductions in fibrosis in the hamster model (Wang et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Cardiomyopathy is a primary degenerative disease of the myocardium and is characterized as various forms, such as hypertrophic or dilated, based on gross appearance (Sakamoto et al., 1997). Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by atrial and ventricular dilation with ventricular wall thinning, severe systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure (Ikeda and Ross, 2000). DCM is one of the main causes of congestive heart failure in humans, is the leading cause of hospitalization of older patients in the United States, and is hereditary in 25% of affected patients (Ikeda and Ross, 2000). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by increased ventricular wall thickness, generally involving the interventricular septum, and normal or reduced left ventricular volume (Richardson et al., 1996, Rodriguez et al., 2009). HCM is the most common, heritable cardiovascular disease in humans, affecting one in 500 people (Bos et al., 2009, Rodriguez et al., 2009). Approximately 10% of humans with HCM eventually develop left ventricular dilation and DCM (Ikeda and Ross, 2000). The cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster is a naturally occurring, inherited, established animal model for both dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the hamster, both DCM and HCM are caused by a defect in the \u03b4-sarcoglycan gene, a component of the dystrophin complex, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion (Bajusz et al., 1969, Escobales and Crespo, 2006, Escobales and Crespo, 2008, Goineau et al., 2001, Ikeda and Ross, 2000, Lipskaia et al., 2007, Ryoke et al., 1999, Sakamoto et al., 1997). The Syrian hamster model shares many features with human DCM and HCM and is used to study the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of cardiomyopathy (Escobales and Crespo, 2008, Ryoke et al., 1999).",

Some strains, such as the Bio 14.6, exhibit compensatory hypertrophy progressing to left ventricular dilation, thinning and impaired function, while strains such as TO-2 develop dilated cardiomyopathy without an initial hypertrophic response (Goineau et al., 2001, Ikeda and Ross, 2000).

These features are partially responsible for decreased cardiac function in this strain, and these abnormalities are hypothesized to be a pathogenic mechanism in human DCM (Goineau et al., 2001). Deficiency of the \u03b4-sarcoglycan gene also affects peripheral and coronary vasculature, ultimately contributing to heart failure in cardiomyopathic hamster models (Escobales and Crespo, 2006, Escobales and Crespo, 2008, Lipskaia et al., 2007). Angiotensin II promotes increased oxidative stress and decreased peripheral vasorelaxation, leading to high systemic blood pressure and increased cardiac work load in cardiomyopathic prone TO-2 hamsters (Escobales and Crespo, 2006). Angiotensin-II-dependent oxidative stress influences coronary vasculature by causing endothelial dysfunction which predisposes hamsters to the development of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy (Escobales and Crespo, 2008). Based on the similarities between cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters and humans, these results associate angiotensin II with the development of cardiomyopathy in humans with hereditary sarcoglycanopathies (Escobales and Crespo, 2008).",

Syrian hamster cardiomyopathic strains are used in research targeting prevention and treatment of the condition. The treatment of cardiomyopathic hamsters with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves left ventricular contractility and coronary flow, providing evidence that Syrian hamsters are useful models in studying drug treatment interventions. Coronary vasculature renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a role in generating increased coronary reactivity and resistance in young Syrian hamsters that have yet to develop cardiomyopathy. Early RAS blockade may prevent and improve the clinical signs of cardiomyopathy (Escobales and Crespo, 2008). Finally, the administration of carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2-blocker with \u03b11-blocker properties, to 6-month-old TO-2 hamsters, improves cardiac function due to decreased peripheral resistance (Cruz et al., 2007).",

Longitudinal and transverse incisions allow exposure of the pouch in a single-layer preparation with high optical clarity, making this method one of the standards for microcirculation studies (Davis and Gore, 1985, Svensjo, 1990). The disadvantages of the everted preparation are restricted blood flow due to tension on the retractor muscle, and the requirement of pouch incisions. Refined everted techniques eliminate the disadvantage of restricted blood flow. Following a skin incision to expose the pouch the retractor muscle is removed and a thin glass support plate is positioned in the cheek pouch which allows unrestricted blood flow. The everted pouch can then be observed in a chamber attached over the microscope condenser system.

In the model of pressure-induced ischemia a translucent pressure chamber is pressed against the cheek pouch for variable amounts of time and then released to produce reperfusion (Romanus et al., 1977, Yasuhara et al., 1991). The disadvantage of this model is that the results are influenced by the pressure applied to the tissue. In a second model, ischemia is produced by tightening a latex cuff around the neck of an everted cheek pouch for up to an hour followed by cuff release (Persson et al., 1985, Yasuhara et al., 1991). The disadvantage of this model is that tension on the retractor muscle is produced by the everted preparation. Alternatively, ischemia can be induced by compressing the feed arteries and collecting veins of the pouch with a piece of silastic tubing or atraumatic microvascular clips (Bertuglia and Reiter, 2007, de With et al., 2005).",

            "text": "In the incomplete ischemia model, ischemia of the cheek pouch is produced by occluding the ipsilateral common carotid artery, its external branch, and the contralateral external carotid artery (Erlansson et al., 1987, Yasuhara et al., 1991). Partial ischemia better reproduces ischemia as seen in the clinical setting, when compared to models of global ischemia. The disadvantages of this model are that the degree of ischemia is not easily evaluated, and occlusion of the carotid arteries reduces cerebral blood flow (Yasuhara et al., 1991). A further refinement of the incomplete ischemia model is produced by selecting two sections of cheek pouch and placing a triangular chamber made of polyester/plastic film in each area. Ischemia is induced by applying a set amount of pressure to a cover slip over one of the chambers, while the other area acts as a control. Increased pressure is avoided by using a 1.0-mm aperture at one of the chamber corners. Reperfusion is produced when pressure is released after 1 hour (Yasuhara et al., 1991). The advantages of this method include decreased trauma to the pouch microcirculation, the ability to select various sizes of tissue, the maintenance of blood flow in surrounding microvasculature, and the ability to study both ischemic and non-ischemic areas simultaneously. In addition to the cheek pouch, the dorsal skin-fold chamber method can be used in ischemia reperfusion research utilizing an O-shaped silicone ring pressed into the tissue with an adjustable screw clamp, leading to cessation of blood flow into and out of the chamber (Pickelmann et al., 1999).",

Melatonin, a potent antioxidant, effectively preserves microcirculation in the hamster cheek pouch during ischemia reperfusion, making melatonin administration a possible preventative measure during situations when ischemia reperfusion injury is a possibility (Bertuglia and Reiter, 2007). Another possible preventative intervention is daflon, a highly purified flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.

Specifically, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to Andes and Maporal viruses which cause fatal pneumonia and edema in experimentally infected hamsters (McElroy et al., 2004, Milazzo et al., 2002, Wahl-Jensen et al., 2007). In contrast, Sin Nombre virus readily infects the hamster but does not cause disease. Further, Choclo virus is not fatal in the hamster (Eyzaguirre et al., 2008). These varying results create an understanding of how these agents produce disease. Specifically, Choclo virus damages the endothelium of the lung without significantly inciting inflammation (Eyzaguirre et al., 2008). In contrast, Andes virus targets endothelium and induces a proinflammatory response (Eyzaguirre et al., 2008, Hooper et al., 2001, Hooper et al., 2008). This same proinflammatory response is noted in humans with severe HPS. It therefore seems likely that more pathogenic viruses produce disease by both directly damaging lung endothelium and inducing a potent proinflammatory response (Eyzaguirre et al., 2008, Hooper et al., 2001, Hooper et al., 2008). Based upon these data a potential treatment of HPS would be the initiation of anti-inflammatory therapy.",

The etiological agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003). The outbreak was controlled through quarantine of infected individuals and travel advisories (Subbarao and Roberts, 2006). The possibility of future SARS outbreaks has led to the search for an appropriate animal model to study the pathogenesis and potential therapeutics for SARS (Subbarao and Roberts, 2006).",

In the lungs, peak viral replication occurs two days post-infection and is cleared by day 7; however, low levels of virus are present in the nasal turbinates for up to 14 days (Roberts et al., 2005). SARS-CoV elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in the hamster which can be detected in sera at day 7 post infection and hamsters are protected from re-challenge by 28 days after initial infection (Roberts et al., 2005). In hamsters, viral replication occurs in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and causes interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary consolidation, and diffuse alveolar damage. A positive correlation exists between pulmonary viral titer and the extent of pneumonia, making the hamster an excellent model for studying the efficacy of potential vaccines and immunotherapy for SARS (Subbarao and Roberts, 2006). Despite the high level of viral replication and associated histopathological lesions, hamsters exhibit no overt clinical signs (Roberts et al., 2005).",

Disease occurs when the normal colonic flora is disrupted typically due to clindamycin, ampicillin, or cephalosporin administration and overgrowth of toxin-producing strains of C. difficile (Poutanen and Simor, 2004). Pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce two toxins, enterotoxin A and cytotoxin B, which are the major virulence factors for C. difficile (Razaq et al., 2007). Outbreaks of C. difficile, beginning in 2000, are attributed to a newly recognized strain, known as the BI strain (McDonald et al., 2005). In addition to the other toxins mentioned the BI strain of C. difficile produces a binary toxin, has an 18-bp deletion in the tcdC locus (a negative regulator of toxin A and B), and is resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics (McDonald et al., 2005). Patients that acquire C. difficile may remain asymptomatic carriers or develop diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, or toxic megacolon (Al-Eidan et al., 2000). Treatment consists of stopping the initiating antibiotics and beginning treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin for 10 days. Relapse after completion of treatment occurs in about 20% of cases (Pepin et al., 2005).",

In this model, M. pneumoniae is inoculated into hamsters via either the aerosol, intranasal, or intratracheal routes, and infection results in changes that are consistent with natural human disease (Clyde, 1971). The intratracheal route consistently produces pulmonary disease of greater severity with greater colonization than the other routes of exposure (Barile et al., 1988). In general, peak disease severity occurs 2 weeks post inoculation with hamsters over 6 weeks of age becoming most severely affected (Barile et al., 1988). Assessment of experimental vaccines and other therapeutics can be accomplished by assessment of lung lesion scores. Specifically, lung lesions are scored microscopically by evaluating the degree of leukocyte cell infiltrates, luminal exudate, and parenchymal pneumonia in three cross-sections of the entire lung (Barile et al., 1988). Alternatively, following treatment with a potential chemotherapy agent, viable mycoplasmas in the lung can be quantitated by homogenizing the lungs in mycoplasma liquid medium and plating serial dilutions on agar medium. The use of the hamster in M. pneumoniae research has decreased in recent years (2000 and beyond). This reduction likely stems from the wide availability of mice free of Mycoplasma spp.",

The primary lesions form about 3 weeks after inoculation as erythematous papules, which enlarge and become ulcerated by 4 weeks (Figure 34.4A\n). The lesions continue to expand until the sixth to eighth week post-inoculation when they begin to heal slowly (Kajdacsy-Balla et al., 1993). Around 24 weeks post-infection, secondary lesions develop as perioral ulcers (Figure 34.4B) and an erythematous rash on the paws and cranial trunk (Kajdacsy-Balla et al., 1993). Most infected hamsters die within 28\u201332 weeks following inoculation due to malnutrition from the presence of severe perioral ulcers. If the hamster survives, the perioral ulcers will resolve. Tertiary lesions in hamsters are not documented; however, this could be due to the rarity of survival past the secondary stage.",

In some areas of the world, up to 97% of people are positive for T. gondii antibodies (Santos et al., 2009). Infection is usually asymptomatic; however, infection during pregnancy may lead to abortions or to offspring that develop mental retardation, epilepsy, or toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis (Lopez et al., 2000).

In Chagas-endemic areas of Central and South America, the most common route of infection is from the triatomine insect, which shed T. cruzi in their feces. Chagas disease is comprised of two phases, acute and chronic. The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months following infection and symptoms include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting (Kirchhoff, 1993). Gross lesions may include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and local swelling at the site of parasite entry. Rarely, young children or immunocompromised people develop fatal myocarditis or meningoencephalitis (Kirchhoff, 1993). During the chronic phase, infection may remain dormant for decades; however, up to 30% of infected people will develop life-threatening inflammatory cardiomyopathy 15\u201330 years following infection (Koberle, 1968).",

Taeniosis is usually asymptomatic but may result in mild gastrointestinal disturbances (McAdam and Sharpe, 2010). In contrast, when humans ingest embryonated eggs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with human feces, they may serve as intermediate hosts (cysticercosis) (McAdam and Sharpe, 2010). The larvae hatch, penetrate the intestinal wall and disseminate to other organs where they encyst (McAdam and Sharpe, 2010). Cysticerci develop in the central nervous system, heart, eyes, subcutaneous tissue, and skeletal muscle. Clinical manifestations depend on where the cysticerci develop and may include neurologic, cardiac, or ocular deficits, or even death (Avila et al., 2002, Avila et al., 2006).",

Utilizing this method, scrapie prion protein is detected in the ipsilateral sciatic nerve 60 days post infection and 80 days post infection in the contralateral nerve (Kratzel et al., 2007b). Within the brain, the red nucleus correlating with the ipsilateral sciatic nerve produces stronger prion protein immunoreactivity compared to the contralateral nucleus.

In contrast, the contralateral popliteal lymph node remains negative throughout the study, indicating that systemic spread of scrapie prion protein through the lymphoreticular system does not occur (Kratzel et al., 2007a). Removal of the ipsilateral popliteal lymph node 4 weeks prior to infection with scrapie does not affect the incubation period or mean survival time at high or medium doses; however, at low doses, hamsters remain free of clinical symptoms for 314 days post inoculation (duration of experiment) (Kratzel et al., 2007a).

There are currently 20 clinical syndromes in humans associated with amyloid deposition and each syndrome is classified into primary or secondary amyloidosis based on chemical composition (Hukkanen et al., 2006). Primary amyloidosis is the result of overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains and is principally of neoplastic or genetic origin. Reactive or secondary amyloidosis is the result of the accumulation of \u03b2-pleated fibrils composed of serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute-phase protein associated with inflammation (Hukkanen et al., 2006). In addition to SAA, in reactive amyloidosis, amyloid deposits contain a minor protein component called amyloid P (AP) derived from serum AP (SAP) (Coe and Ross, 1990). Amyloidosis occurs both spontaneously and after induction with amyloid-inducing substances in Syrian hamsters. The spontaneous disease is more prevalent in females compared to males and spontaneous occurrence is promoted by fight wounds, stress, high-protein diets, and various infectious agents (Gruys and Snel, 1994). Syrian hamsters are commonly used as a model of induced amyloidosis, using casein or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) subcutaneous injections (Hol et al., 1986, Niewold et al., 1987). The lag or pre-amyloid phase associated with these amyloid-inducing substances can be accelerated by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection with amyloid-enhancing factors (AEF), which are small fragments of amyloid fibrils (Hol et al., 1986, Niewold et al., 1987). AEF injection shortens the pre-amyloid phase for splenic, hepatic, and renal amyloid deposition (Hol et al., 1986).",

The hamster amyloid model provides the unique opportunity to hormonally manipulate the synthesis of FP and study concurrent amyloid deposition. Female hamsters, when compared to males, possess higher serum concentrations of FP, acquire more amyloid at an earlier age and die at an earlier age due to amyloid accumulation (Coe and Ross, 1990). In the Syrian hamster, FP rather than amyloid fibril, plays a predominant role in the sex-limited expression of amyloidosis (Coe and Ross, 1990). Male Syrian hamsters that are deprived of testosterone by castration or administered diethylstilbestrol (DES) acquire amyloid deposition at an earlier age similar to female hamsters (Coe and Ross, 1990). The amyloidogenic effect of DES in male hamsters is inhibited by testosterone injections, and female hamsters given testosterone are also protected from amyloid deposition (Coe and Ross, 1990). These studies established the importance of FP in this disease and it is hypothesized that FP undergoes calcium-dependent binding of amyloid fibrils which stabilizes and protects the amyloid fibrils after formation (Coe and Ross, 1990).",

The first stage is the perinatal period when neural circuits become sexually differentiated and the initial programming of adult responses to hormones occurs. The second stage is adolescence, when the structural and functional organization of behavioral circuits are refined and completed, resulting in the expression of sex-typical social behaviors. The presence of testosterone during adolescence results in adults who more readily display male-typical social behaviors compared to adults that matured in the absence of testosterone (Schulz and Sisk, 2006). The testosterone exposure during adolescence defeminizes the brain and behavioral responses to estradiol and progesterone (Schulz and Sisk, 2006).",

These steroids induce a variety of negative effects including heightened aggression, changes in sexual libido, testicular atrophy, baldness, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Leshner, 2000). Hamsters are used to study the deleterious behavioral effects of exogenous steroid administration. Specifically adolescent (post-pubertal) male hamsters exposed to anabolic steroids for 2\u20134 weeks show an increase in aggression (DeLeon et al., 2002, Grimes and Melloni, 2002, Melloni and Ferris, 1996\n). In addition, when adolescent hamsters are given exogenous anabolic steroids they do not express submissive behaviors such as defensive posturing, escape dashes, or tail-up walking (Salas-Ramirez et al., 2008). Both adolescent male and adult male hamsters treated with anabolic steroids display increased flank marking. In adolescent hamsters, exposure to anabolic steroids results in levels of sexual behavior comparable to adult hamsters. In contrast, steroid administration in adult hamsters results in decreased sexual behavior compared to untreated controls. These studies suggest that the adolescent brain is more vulnerable than the adult brain to the adverse behavioral consequences of exogenous steroids (DeLeon et al., 2002, Grimes and Melloni, 2002, Melloni and Ferris, 1996, Salas-Ramirez et al., 2008).",

The hamster provides a model to evaluate the deleterious effects of inadequate nutrition on fertility. A negative energy balance in hamsters suppresses ovulatory cycles and estrus behavior (Wade et al., 1996). Food deprivation decreases estrogen receptor immunoreactivity in the ventromedial hypothalamus, implying a direct neurological effect of food deprivation in sexual behavior. Treatment with leptin promotes female sexual behavior in ad libitum-fed hamsters; however, in food-deprived hamsters, leptin treatment fails to overcome the loss of estrus behavior associated with poor nutrition. Interestingly, leptin-induced changes in female sexual behavior are not accompanied by changes in estrogen receptor immunoreactivity of the hypothalamus, implying that leptin acts via another mechanism (Wade et al., 1997). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) may play a role in nutritional infertility. Injections of NPY into the central nervous system stimulate robust and long-lasting increases in food intake in hamsters while simultaneously reducing estrus behavior (Corp et al., 2001, Kulkosky et al., 1988). These studies provide strong evidence that multiple pathways (leptin and NPY) control alterations in female nutrition-associated fertility.",

            "text": "Dystonia, characterized by involuntary twisting movements and abnormal postures caused by co-contractions of antagonistic muscle groups, is the third most common movement disorder in humans (Raike et al., 2005). The disease is a heterogeneous disorder because patients display clinical signs associated with many different brain regions. Primary dystonia is inherited or arises spontaneously, and secondary dystonia follows brain trauma or insult. These disorders can be further classified, based on affected muscle groups, as focal (involving a small number of muscles) or generalized dystonia (involving all of the muscles throughout the body). The dtsz disorder exhibited in the Bio 86.93 inbred line of Syrian hamsters is an animal model of generalized dystonia (Loscher et al., 1989, Raike et al., 2005). The disorder in hamsters, originally designated sz because of the seizure-like presentation, is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion (Loscher et al., 1989). The mutation was later renamed dystonic and symbolized as dtsz. In hamsters, dystonic attacks last several hours, vary in severity, progress from the head to the extremities, and are partially age-dependent with signs mostly disappearing after 8 weeks of age (Raike et al., 2005). The dtsz phenotype is modified by hormonal fluctuations and late-term pregnant and nursing dtsz hamsters experience attacks (Raike et al., 2005). Attacks begin with rapid vibrissae twitching, flattening of the ears, and facial contortions, followed by stiffening of the hindlimbs, gait abnormalities, and falling episodes, ending with limb hyperextension, severe truncal torsion, and immobility (Loscher et al., 1989, Raike et al., 2005). The dystonic attacks are stress-induced and initiated by placing the hamsters in a new environment. The motor disturbances can also be pharmacologically initiated with subconvulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin, or inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonists (Gernert et al., 1999, Loscher et al., 1989). The generalized syndrome in humans shares many phenotypic features with hamster dystonia including prolonged attacks lasting up to 4 hours, onset in infancy or childhood, and attacks initiated by stress or excitement (Loscher et al., 1989).",

In normal hamster skin, eosinophils are rarely found; however, a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate occurs during cutaneous wound healing.

TRFK-5 is injected intraperitoneally 7 and 4 days before and on the same day as wound creation. An absence of eosinophils results in accelerated re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds, with wound closure occurring 4 days faster than in non-TRFK-5-treated animals. One mechanism which could explain the accelerated wound healing is a reduction in TGF-\u03b21, which is antiproliferative for keratinocytes.

Similar to cutaneous wounds, eosinophils infiltrate oral wounds and express TGF-\u03b21, however, they do not express TGF-\u03b1 (Yang et al., 1996). The lack of TGF-\u03b1 expression by eosinophils in oral wounds may reflect the presence of TGF-\u03b1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in hamster saliva. Oral eosinophils can be induced to express TGF-\u03b1 by first performing sialoadenectomy of the submaxillary and sublingual complex to knock-out the salivary-associated TGF-\u03b1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Yang et al., 1996). Furthermore, oral eosinophils cease producing TGF-\u03b1 when EGF is supplemented in the drinking water.

Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, when administered in conjunction with naproxen, results in a significant reduction in number and size of gastric ulcers without modifying gastric acid secretion (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999). This same protection is noted in humans (Dajani and Agrawal, 1995). Famotidine, an H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production, does not reduce the prevalence or number of gastric ulcers in the hamster (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999). Similarly, H2-receptor antagonists do not consistently reduce NSAID-induced gastric ulceration in humans (Dajani and Agrawal, 1995). These results suggest that gastric acid secretion is not the primary mechanism of naproxen-induced ulceration in hamsters or humans and that the naproxen hamster model accurately models NSAID-induced antral ulceration in humans (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999).",

The assay can be utilized both clinically and experimentally to determine human sperm fertility and it analyzes the ability of sperm to capacitate eggs, udergo the acrosome reaction, and fuse with the oocyte. Limitations of the assay are that it is labor-intensive, and difficult to standardize. Despite these limitations, results obtained in the hamster assay correlate well with human in vitro fertilization. Since intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is replacing standard IVF in many settings the utility of the zona-free hamster assay from a clinical perspective may be waning.",
