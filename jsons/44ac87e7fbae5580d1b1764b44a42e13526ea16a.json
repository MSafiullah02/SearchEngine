            "text": "ASPHO ABSTRACTS S19 Background: Children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at increased risk of having potentially fatal viral infections including adenovirus which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Cidofovir is a nucleotide phosphate analogue that competitively inhibits the incorporation of deoxycytidine triphosphate into DNA by viral DNA polymerase thereby disrupting further chain elongation. It has demonstrated in-vitro activity against a number of DNA viruses including adenovirus, herpesvirus, poxvirus, papillomavirus and polyomavirus when given intravenously (IV) . Recent case repots have described the safe and successful administration by inhalation for the treatment of respiratory viral infections. Objectives: To report the case of a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient treated with inhaled cidofovir for adenovirus pneumonitis. Design/Method: Case report and literature review Results: A 5 year old Hispanic female with past medical history of Fanconi anemia who developed multi-organ failure requiring dialysis and respiratory support for adenovirus pneumonitis 90 days after umbilical cord stem cell transplant. Tracheal aspirate at the time of intubation was positive for adenovirus by PCR. Despite maximal doses of IV cidofovir (adjusted for renal failure) her viral load continued to trend up and she was clinically deteriorating. After obtaining parental consent, she was treated with inhaled cidofovir 40mg diluted in 20mls of normal saline administered daily via ET tube for a total of 12 doses based on a previously published case report. She progressively improved clinically, eventually requiring minimal ventilator support and the adenovirus viral load in tracheal aspirate dropped progressively from 112,000 to 800 DNA copies/mL. No immediate complication was observed. Conclusion: Though adenovirus pneumonitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among pediatric HSCT recipients, its treatment can be challenging. Inhaled cidofovir offers an alternative to IV cidofovir for patients with renal failure in whom IV cidofovir might be contraindicated due to nephrotoxicity. Further well designed studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy inhaled cidofovir.",

While early diagnosis is crucial, non-specific clinical signs such as isolated prolonged fever often make correct identification of IFI a challenge. (1\u21923)-\u00df-D-glucan (BDG) is a major cell wall component of invasive fungi and is detectable in the serum to facilitate diagnosis of IFI. While BDG positivity has been validated for diagnosis of IFI in adult populations, correlation between BDG and IFI remains unproven in pediatric cancer. Objectives: To assess the correlation between detectable serum BDG (via Fungitell C assay) and IFI in at-risk pediatric populations with AML. Design/Method: This is a retrospective cohort study of pediatric subjects with AML <21 years at diagnosis treated at Miller Children's & Women's Hospital Long Beach with at least one reported BDG assay. Antifungal prophylaxis, quantity of detectable BDG, and any associated IFI evaluation (cultures, radiographic imaging, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, pathology) were collected and independently reviewed for this study. \"Positive\" IFI was defined as probable/proven according to the 2008 consensus EORTC/MSG guidelines (excluding BDG). Multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated with varying BDG thresholds ranging from 60 to 500 pg/ml. Using the best fit curve, we analyzed specificity, sensitivity, and true positive likelihood ratio (LR+) across thresholds to determine the optimal boundary limit of serum BDG associated with an IFI in this pediatric oncology population. Results: A total of 228 reported BDG assays and IFI evaluations were reviewed from 53 chemotherapy cycles administered to 18 eligible subjects. Routine antifungal prophylaxis was administered to all subjects (fluconazole or echinocandin);\"positive\" IFI was diagnosed in 6/18 subjects (33%). Inspection of the best fit ROC curve (AUC 0.856) identified a BDG threshold of \u08d980 pg/ml as associated with the highest \"correct classification\" (89%, LR+ 9.2) and balance of specificity (92.2%) and sensitivity (73.0%). Increasing the threshold to 120 pg/ml decreased correct classification (86.4%), and markedly affected sensitivity (51.4%) with only a minor improvement in specificity (93.2%). Conclusion: Detection of BDG at a threshold of \u08d980 pg/ml is sufficiently specific to aid in the diagnosis of IFI in pediatric populations with AML.",

Little is known about the effect of maternal drug use on the neonatal immune system and lymphocyte counts. We hypothesized that maternal drug use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal lymphopenia. Recognizing this possible increased risk of infection in this population can allow for appropriate counseling and precautions. Objectives: Identify if newborns exposed to intrauterine drugs experienced hematologic abnormalities, specifically lymphopenia. Design/Method: Retrospective chart review of neonates born between 2003 and 2014 with a documented drug withdrawal syndrome was conducted. Medical records obtained by an electronic search for infants with the following ICD-9 codes: 779.4 (drug reactions and intoxications specific to newborns), 779.5 (drug withdrawal syndrome in newborn), and 305.5 (nondependent abuse of opioids); gestational age of the infant at birth, birth weight, type of maternal drug used, duration of hospitalization, treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), infant's absolute lymphocyte count, documented co-morbidities, and duration of drug exposure were recorded. Results: 81 neonates had a documented diagnosis of NAS during the time period reviewed. 31 had complete blood counts drawn (mean time of 6 hours of life) available for review. Manual differentials were utilized when available. By using an ALC cut-off of 3400/uL (<10th percentile), 14/31 neonates (45%) with the diagnosis of drug withdrawal syndrome were lymphopenic. Lymphopenic infants were noted to have longer NAS treatment duration (12.7 days vs. 8.9 days) as well as longer length of hospitalization (29 days vs. 16 days). 36% of lymphopenic infants were preterm (<37 weeks gestation.) 86% of infants were exposed to opioids; exposure was confirmed by a positive maternal drug screen or positive neonatal meconium drug screen. Conclusion: 45% of infants with the diagnosis of drug withdrawal syndrome were lymphopenic and these infants required longer duration of treatment for NAS. We are investigating the possible relationship between severity of NAS and neonatal lymphopenia. Further analysis is needed to determine if this correlation is noted in a larger study population, if the effect is transient, and how the child's clinical status during the neonatal period and throughout childhood may be affected.",

            "text": "Background: Studies have shown that patients suffering from ITP have polarized Th1 or Th2 response and cytokine deregulation. The Th1/Th2 balance was well known to regulate the immune system under normal conditions and to be impaired in autoimmune diseases like ITP. In order to study the mechanism of T lymphocyte abnormalities in children ITP, we should ensure the homogeneity of the objects. Due to children ITP often have abrupt and severe onset of thrombocytopenia, we prescribe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at the first day of hospitalization to prevent hemorrhage, as well as methypredisolone (MP), which is often be used when exclusion of malignancy. For this reason, T lymphocyte function evaluation involved detection of cytokines secreted by Th1, Th2 and Th17 etc. might be interrupted by treatment we mentioned above. Objectives: Our study was designed to explore the influence of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone (MP) on cytokines secreted by T lymphocyte in children ITP. Design/Method: We enrolled 62 patients with first diagnosed ITP and ultimate duration was less than 3 months without recurrence (38 boys and 24 girls, age range 2-178 months, median 33 months). We enrolled children ITP at the onset of their disease from our department between December 2011 and March 2013. We followed them until 12months of their whole duration, choosing the patients whose ultimate duration less than 3 months and no recurrence. Cytokines measurement by cytometric bead array included IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF, IFN and IL-17. We divided patients into 3 groups according to the treatment they received before testing cytokines level, then we compared T cell cytokines' level among these groups. Results: We enrolled 62 patients with first diagnosed ITP and ultimate duration was less than 3 months without recurrence (38 boys and 24 girls, age range 2-178 months, median 33 months). We found IL-2 level is decreased in both group treated with MP for 1 day (N = 29, P = 0.042) and group in which patients treated with IVIG for 1 day (N = 18, P = 0.048) compared with group without any treatment (N = 15). While the other cytokines' level have no difference among groups. Conclusion: As for children ITP, although pathways of MP and IVIG in treating thrombocytopenia were different, they both could decrease IL-2 in children ITP ultimately. As a representative cytokine of TH1 cell, IL-2 has been demonstrated to be important in lymphocyte activation and mobilization. So we considered that MP and IVIG can reduce the T cell activation and production of auto-antibodies by decrease IL-2.",

All patients maintained platelet counts above goal following discontinuation of romiplostim. No adverse effects from romiplostim injections were observed. Conclusion: Romiplostim successfully treated TRT without any adverse effects in this case series. While possible risk of leukemic clone proliferation may limit use of romiplostim for TRT in children with hematologic malignancies, romiplostim could be a very beneficial treatment for TRT in children with solid tumors. It may limit treatment delays and dose reductions, ultimately leading to improved overall survival. Prospective studies on this use of romiplostim are warranted.",

Surgery is generally reserved for localized disease while conventional medical treatments like steroids and chemotherapeutic agents produce substantial side effects with variable results. Current evidence demonstrates an important regulatory function of the PI3-kinase/Akt/ mTOR pathway in vasculogenesis and supports mTOR inhibition with sirolimus as a therapeutic target. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in the treatment of patients with GLA and GSD. Design/Method: This study analyzed combined data from a multicenter systematic retrospective review of medical records of patients treated with sirolimus between January 2007 and June 2014 and from the prospective Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of sirolimus in the treatment of complicated vascular anomalies (NCT00975819). Disease improvement was determined by radiologic imaging, QOL measurements and clinical status assessments. Sirolimus dosing regimens, toxicities and side effect causality were evaluated. Results: Of the evaluable patients, nineteen had GLA or GSD (13 GLA, 6 GSD). As expected, no patients had complete resolution of clinical symptoms and radiologic disease with sirolimus. Overall partial disease response was 84% (92% GLA, 67% GSD) with 79% of patients with improved QOL, 63% with improved clinical status and 39% with improved radiological response. Improvement occurred in 83% of patients with pleural effusions and 50% with pericardial effusions; no patients with pre-existing pleural or pericardial effusions worsened on therapy. Disease progression occurred in 1 GSD patient due to reported decreased QOL. Five patients experienced grade 3 or 4 drug toxicities without requiring dose reductions. Most common side effects were bone marrow suppression, mucositis/stomatitis and hypertriglyceridemia. Conclusion: Sirolimus is a safe and well-tolerated treatment that appears to reduce symptoms and/or stabilize disease in patients with GLA and GSD. Given the significant morbidity and mortality in patients with complicated lymphatic malformations, future treatment studies need to address these specific phenotypes.",

            "text": "Background: Genetic alterations causing overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, are associated with a form of high-risk Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CRLF2 B-ALL). Activation of the CRLF2 receptor by the cytokine, TSLP, results in activation of the JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/MTOR pathways, both of which have been associated with chemoresistance and upregulation of Bcl2 family pro-survival genes. Objectives: To determine the effect of TSLP-CRLF2 mediated signals on expression of Bcl2 family proteins and the efficacy of targeting Bcl2 family pro-survival proteins in CRLF2 B-ALL. Design/Method: Flow cytometry and Western blot were used to evaluate Bcl2 family protein expression in CRLF B-ALL cells cultured with and without TSLP. Flow cytometry was used to for Annexin V/7-AAD and Caspase 3/7 assays of apoptosis following treatment of CRLF2 B-ALL cells with in the presence and absence of TSLP. Results: TSLP increased expression of the Bcl2 family pro-survival protein, Mcl-1, in CRLF2 B-ALL cell lines with activating JAK mutations (MUTZ5 and CALL4). Treatment with Mcl-1 inhibitor (Mim-1) reduced cell counts by >90% and this reduction was maintained in the presence of TSLP. Reductions in cell number were due to a dose-dependent increase in caspase-mediated apoptosis reaching >95% cell death after 3 days in concentrations of Mim-1 over 15 uM, even when TSLP was present. We saw increased expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl2 when doses of Mcl-1 inhibitor were 30 uM or higher, but very little change at lower doses, suggesting that observed increases are more likely to be selective survival of cells expressing high levels of these alternative Bcl2 family pro-survival molecules rather than compensatory upregulated expression. Conclusion: These data suggest that TSLP can contribute to chemoresistance via upregulation of the Bcl2 family protein, Mcl-1, even in cases of CRLF2 B-ALL with activating JAK mutations. These results provide evidence that therapy to target Mcl-1 could be an effective treatment for Ph-like ALL where CRLF2 is overexpressed.",

Most common reasons to avoid LMWH were paucity of literature, perceived increased bleeding risk and needle phobia. Conclusion: Despite the prevalence of VM in children our survey highlights the expected practice variability in the management of coagulopathies. Lack of evidence was recognized as the main obstacle for the use of anticoagulants. Further characterization of coagulation complications, as well as risk stratification for both bleeding/thrombosis can pave the way towards future guidelines. Background: Ikaros, a protein encoded by the IKZF1 gene, acts as a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by regulating expression of its target genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we showed that Ikaros binds to the promoter of the CDC42 gene in human ALL. The CDC42 gene encodes a small GTPase that acts as an oncogene in solid tumors, but it has not been associated with leukemia. We hypothesize that Ikaros regulates CDC42 expression and that CDC42 is involved in ALL pathogenesis. Objectives: 1) To determine the role of Ikaros in regulating CDC42 expression in ALL.",

Design/Method: Ikaros overexpression and knock-out was by transduction with retroviral vector containing Ikaros and Ikaros shRNA, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate Ikaros effects on the CDC42 promoter. Gene expression was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. DNA binding was measured by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP). Cell proliferation was assayed by WST and synergistic cytotoxic effects of compounds was analyzed using Calcusyn. Results: Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that Ikaros represses CDC42 transcription. CDC42 is overexpressed in B-ALL and T-ALL as compared to normal bone marrow. CDC42 overexpression correlates with high white blood cell count in ALL. Treatment of ALL with a specific CDC42 inhibitor (ML141) produced a cytotoxic effect. In leukemia, Ikaros binding to the CDC42 promoter and its ability to repress CDC42 is impaired due to phosphorylation by pro-oncogenic Casein Kinase II (CK2). Inhibition of CK2 with a clinically-tested inhibitor, CX-4945, restored Ikaros binding to the CDC42 promoter and transcriptional repression of CDC42. The use of CX-4945 in combination with the CDC42 inhibitor, ML141, produced a synergistic cytotoxic effect in both B-ALL and T-ALL. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that CDC42 is overexpressed in ALL and is a potential therapeutic target in leukemia. Expression of CDC42 in ALL is regulated by Ikaros and CK2. Targeting CK2 in combination with CDC42 inhibitors is a potential novel treatment for ALL.",

            "text": "Background: We have shown previously that the neuronatin gene (NNAT) undergoes aberrant DNA hypermethylation associated with transcriptional silencing in a majority of childhood acute leukemia cases. The clinical significance of loss of NNAT expression in childhood leukemia, however, is unknown. Objectives: The goal of our study was to correlate clinical characteristics and outcomes with NNAT expression in precursor B -acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Design/Method: Sixty seven consecutive cases of non-infant precursor B-ALL presenting between 2005 and 2011 were analyzed retrospectively utilizing bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis and data from the medical record. For each sample, site-specific NNAT methylation was quantitated by combined restriction/bisulfite analysis (COBRA) and NNAT mRNA expression was qualitatively determined by end point RT-PCR. Clinical characteristics including age at presentation, white blood cell count (WBC) at presentation, immunophenotype, induction response, and survival were compared between NNAT hypermethylator and normal methylator groups and between NNAT expressor and nonexpressor groups. Results: NNAT methylation and expression status was determined for 28 cases. Hypermethylation (defined as site-specific methylation > 60%) was identified in 16/28 ALL samples. NNAT silencing (loss of expression) was identified in 15/28 samples). We found cases exhibiting loss of NNAT expression were more likely than expressors to be associated with a WBC > 50,000/mm3 at diagnosis (p = 0.037). Also the EFS for the high-risk group approached statistically significant difference between the expressor and non-expressor groups. Conclusion: Loss of NNAT expression was associated with an elevated WBC count (>50,000/mm3) at presentation. While EFS and OS did not differ significantly between expressor and non-expressor groups in the overall analysis, when we restricted the analysis to patients exhibiting high-risk characteristics of elevated WBC or age > 10 years, the EFS advantage of expressors over non-expressors approached statistical significance. Given the relative stability of the tails of these EFS curves, analysis of additional patients may yield a statistically significance difference. While NNAT has been shown to regulate endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis in some cell types, the biological basis for clinical features associated with loss of NNAT expression in childhood PB-ALL remains to be determined.",

Results: The patient was a boy born at 32-weeks' gestation who presented with respiratory failure secondary to acute abdominal distension at 2 months of age. Ultrasound prior to delivery had shown a 6.9cm left hepatic lobe mass, and MRI confirmed a 7cm x5.2 cm left hepatic lobe hemangioma. On presentation, repeat ultrasound showed the hepatic mass to be stable in size without significant shunting or compression of hepatic vessels, with a large amount of ascites present. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were within range for age . Further workup failed to reveal a primary etiology for his ascites. Due to his critical status, decision was made to excise the mass. Pathology revealed a GLUT-1 negative vascular lesion consistent with a hepatic congenital hemangioma. Post-operatively the baby recovered well the ascites did not re-accumulate. Conclusion: There is a wide range of clinical presentations for focal hepatic hemangiomas, from asymptomatic to critically ill.

            "text": "Background: The t(10;11) CALM-AF10 translocation occurs in patients with T-ALL and AML and is associated with a poor prognosis. CALM-AF10 leukemias are characterized by upregulation of HOXA gene expression, which is a known driver of leukemogenesis. Interaction of the CALM-AF10 oncoprotein with the nuclear export factor CRM1/XPO1 is essential for upregulation of HOXA expression. We have previously demonstrated that CRM1 interacts directly with Hoxa chromatin, suggesting that CRM1 recruits CALM-AF10 to its target genes. However, other mediators may also be involved. In particular, NUP98 is a component of the nuclear pore complex that interacts with CRM1 during nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. Translocations fusing NUP98 with multiple different partners have been described in high-risk leukemias. NUP98 fusion oncoproteins can bind to and activate the transcription of HOXA genes. Objectives: To determine whether NUP98 cooperates with CRM1 and CALM-AF10 to transactivate HOXA genes. Design/Method: We previously created retroviral CALM-and CRM1-AF10 fusion vectors and demonstrated their ability to activate the transcription of a Hoxa7-luciferase reporter. We designed an inducible shRNA retroviral vector targeting Nup98. We performed transient co-transfections of the Hoxa7-luciferase reporter with Nup98 shRNA vectors, together with CALM-AF10, CRM1-AF10 or an empty vector in HEK293 cells. We also stably expressed the inducible NUP98 shRNA vector in NIH3T3 cells. Results: Luciferase assays showed that knockdown of NUP98 increased the baseline level of Hoxa7 transcription but had limited effect on the transcriptional activity of CALM-AF10 and CRM1-AF10. Inducible knockdown of Nup98 also caused an increase of endogenous Hoxa levels in NIH3T3 cells. Conclusion: Surprisingly, silencing of NUP98 increases Hoxa7 transcriptional activation and endogenous Hoxa transcripts. Since NUP98 is important for nuclear export, impeding NUP98 function likely results in nuclear retention of critical proteins and may indirectly deregulate Hoxa transcription. Experiments are underway to determine the role of NUP98 on Hoxa levels in cells expressing CALM-AF10 and CRM1-AF10. Of note, a recent report demonstrated Crm1-dependent direct binding of Nup98-Hoxa9 to Hox genes (Oka et al., Elife 2016) . This further highlights the important interactions among CRM1, NUP98, and Hox loci as a molecular basis for leukemogenic Hox gene dysregulation.",

They are most commonly found on the head, neck and trunk, but can also involve internal organs such as the liver, lung and central nervous system. Oftentimes these lesions can be treated conservatively. Medical management, when needed, consists of laser treatments, surgical excisions and medications including propranolol and steroids. Objectives: To describe a pediatric patient with diffuse hepatic and cutaneous IH and failure to thrive with progressive pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to pulmonary hemangiomas treated with sirolimus. Design/Method: The patient is a three year old African American female who presented shortly after birth with diffuse cutaneous hemangiomas, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and anemia. Abdominal MRI/MRA noted replacement of the entire liver parenchyma by numerous nodular lesions consistent with IH, as well as signs of early heart failure. Skin biopsy confirmed IH. She was started on propranolol and prednisolone for her hemangiomas, as well as medical management of her heart failure. Hepatic and cutaneous hemangiomas improved over time. At 23 months of age, however, she developed severe idiopathic PH diagnosed by right cardiac catheterization with systemic pulmonary artery (PA) pressures at rest responsive to oxygen and nitric oxide.

T cell immunomodulation may be a valuable adjunct to standard therapy. However, studies to date have only demonstrated direct effects of immunomodulation on tumor cell survival. Our work explores methods of manipulating the microenvironment to treat ALL. Poly I:C is a dsRNA analog that has demonstrated a direct effect on tumor growth via IFN pathways, and giving it anti-leukemic effects. However, this siRNA has not been studied on primary stroma in the ALL population, thus no complete understanding of its genetic microenvironmental effect has been offered. Objectives: To determine whether Poly I:C is an siRNA that (1) upregulates IFIT1 gene expression as a measure of activation of interferon pathways and (2) indirectly induces acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell tumor cell death by way of altering primary stromal gene expression. Design/Method: (1) Reverse transfection of 3 different stromal cell lines, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, followed by quantitative PCR to determine poly I:C siRNA mediated upregulation of IFIT1 gene expression. (2) Transfection of three primary stromal cell lines with poly I:C, followed by cell washing, and subsequent ALL cell plating. ALL cell survival will then be measured by flow cytometry. Results: (1) Poly I:C induced IFIT1 gene expression in stromal cells. (2) ALL cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of Poly I:C treated stromal cells. Conclusion: Poly I:C dramatically reduces the capacity of nonmalignant stromal cells to support the viability of primary ALL cells. This finding suggests that drug targeting of marrow stromal cells may provide new approaches to control ALL. Current studies in the lab are exploring the key changes in gene expression pathways induced by Poly I:C in nonmalignant stromal cells that lead to ALL cell death.",

            "text": "Background: Immunologic evasion is one of the hallmarks of cancer, but the mechanisms by which leukemia evades the immune system are incompletely understood. Our lab has found that calcineurin in BCR-ABL+ leukemia cells acts as a potent mediator of immune evasion during leukemogenesis. When the essential subunit of calcineurin is knocked down, immune competent hosts are able to suppress leukemia outgrowth but immunodeficient hosts succumb to disease. We hypothesize that BCR-ABL activates calcineurin and NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells). Objectives: To determine BCR-ABL's role in the activity of calcineurin, as measured by NFAT activity. Design/Method: Baf3 cells were transduced with either empty vector MiG or p190 (BCR-ABL+). Cells were kept in culture and exposed to varying doses of PMA and ionomycin in order to stimulate them. Calcineurin activity was measured via analysis of NFAT, a known downstream effector of calcineurin. Experiments to measure NFAT expression include western blot to assess protein and phosphorylation, real time PCR to assess NFAT dependent transcripts and an NFAT reporter assay to assess transcriptional activity. Results: NFAT activity is increased in BCR-ABL+ cells as compared to control MiG cells, as is evidenced by increased total protein as well as activated protein. Increasing doses of PMA and ionomycin also lead to higher levels of NFAT in both MiG and BCR-ABL+ cells, but is more pronounced in the BCR-ABL+ population. Conclusion: There is more total NFAT and activated NFAT protein present in BCR-ABL+ leukemia cells vs control, suggesting that BCR-ABL activates calcineurin.",

We phenotypically and genetically characterized a 2,000-member Amish pedigree with autosomal dominant VWD type 2M. Sequence analysis of VWF revealed heterozygosity for a missense mutation at position c.4120 (C>T) in 134 individuals. Even with an identical genetic mutation in VWF, these individuals show great variability in bleeding tendencies as measured by a quantifiable score provided by bleeding assessment tools (BAT). Objectives: To identify biologic and genetic variants outside of VWF that influence bleeding in VWD. Design/Method: Whole exome sequencing was performed in 16 members of the family (age and sex matched) that carry the R1374C mutation (7 with the least severe bleeding and 9 with the most severe bleeding). ANNOVAR, a software tool used to functionally annotate genetic variants, was utilized to analyze each variant and predict the effect on protein expression. Concurrently, we analyzed plasma from 12 of the above individuals using SomaLogic proteomics technology to quantify >1,100 proteins that are potentially associated with processes that are involved in bleeding. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to interpret results. Results: IPA analysis revealed differential protein expression within several pathways, of which the most significant include cellular movement (p-value 5.46 E-03), immune cell trafficking (p-value 8.44 E-03), and hematologic system development and function (p-value 9.61E-03). Within these pathways, proteins involved in cell adhesion (i.e. MMP2, VCAM1 and FN1), coagulation (i.e. PLG), and inflammation (i.e. IL1A, IL17A, and CD86) were differentially expressed between high and low bleeders. Analysis of whole exome sequencing revealed 93 genetic variants that were enriched in one group compared to the other. Interestingly, several of these variants correlated to pathways identified in the proteomic data, including KNG1, SELPLG, FGB, STAB2, C4BPA, and GP6. Conclusion: Preliminary analyses show a high prevalence of genes involved in inflammation, cell adhesion and the hematologic system that may be associated with bleeding variability within this Amish family. Further work will focus on replicating these variants in the rest of the members of the family, both affected and unaffected, as well as in hundreds of available unrelated cases with VWD. Background: Inhibition of MERTK with the small molecule inhibitor MRX-2843 decreases tumor burden and prolongs survival in acute leukemia cell line and patient-derived xenograft models. However, while treatment with MRX-2843 reduces leukemia in peripheral blood and spleen, it is less effective in clearing the bone marrow of leukemic blasts. Gas6, a MERTK, Axl, and Tyro3 ligand, is a poor prognostic factor in AML, mediates increased resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy in leukemia cells, and is present in the bone marrow stroma. Objectives: To determine if bone marrow stromal cell Gas6 induces resistance to MRX-2843. Design/Method: Acute leukemia cell lines were cultured in the presence of Gas6-producing fibroblast-like cell lines or bone marrow derived stromal cells (BMDSCs) from wild type or Gas6 knockout mice. Axl-Fc was added to co-cultures to bind and deplete Gas6. Induction of apoptosis and cell death was determined by flow cytometry after treatment with MRX-2843 or vehicle. Expression of MERTK and related kinases AXL and TYRO-3 was determined by immunoblot. Results: Co-culture with Gas6-expressing cell lines significantly reduced leukemia cell death in response to treatment with 300 nM MRX-2843 compared to leukemia cells alone (18.25% versus 93.09%, p<0.001). The protective effect was dose-dependent and reduced by titration of Gas6 with 1 u\u03bcg/mL Axl-FC (7.4% versus 16.5%, p = 0.022). Similarly, BMDSCs from wild-type mice protected leukemia cells from MRX-2843 induced cell death more effectively than BMDSCs from Gas6 knockout mice (4.28% versus 72.39%). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated increased expression of TYRO-3 in leukemia cells in response to co-culture.",

Nearly half (49%) were male; 43% had reported bleeding, 26% no reported bleeding, and 31% had no data on bleeding. Most (90%) had some reported bleeding laboratory test abnormalities, but only 45% had a specific diagnosis reported. Abnormal laboratories included prolonged PT (6.8%), aPTT (17%), PT/aPTT (5%) and platelet-related (10%). While 153 (79%) had single factor deficiencies, vWD or platelet disorders, 41 (21%) had multiple deficiencies. Overall, factor XI deficiency was most common (81) followed by platelet abnormalities (46), factor XII (34), and factor VIII (28). Factors XI+XII (11) and XI+VIII (7) were the most common combined disorders. Conclusion: These results support the importance of identifying bleeding disorders in patients with NS early in childhood, and particularly pre-operatively. The wide span of disorders and frequent presence of multiple disorders, from factor deficiencies to platelet function disorders and vWD, suggests screening needs to go beyond PT/aPTT and platelet count and should include assessment of platelet function. These results highlight the importance of early consultation with a pediatric hematologist specializing in coagulation disorders, and the need to rigorously document the extent of the work-up to accurately describe the types of disorders ruled-out.",

            "text": "Background: The receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility (RHAMM, CD168) has been identified as one of the leukemia associated antigens. There have been studies in which RHAMM alone or in association with CD44 and other proteins promote invasion and inhibition of apoptosis. Paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has good prognosis whereas acute myeloid leukemia (AML) does not. There is a lacunae in the study of RHAMM expression and its prognostic significance in pediatric acute leukemias. Objectives: To study the expression of RHAMM in paediatric acute leukemias and its prognostic significance. Design/Method: Paraffin blocks of 73 bone marrow trephine biopsies of paediatric acute leukemias were processed for immunohistochemistry by standardized automated technique. The primary antibody used was ABCAM USA. The relative proportion (percentage) of positively stained tumor cells was quantified by three observers. Blast percentage was done in the bone marrow aspirate taken at day 8 of induction to assess the immediate response. The percentage of RHAMM positive cells and the response to induction therapy were correlated. The clinical follow up of the cases with Kaplan-Meier plot and the initial RHAMM expression were also correlated. Results: AML: ALL ratio was 1:5 and the male: female ratio was 2:1. The mean age was 9.2 years (ALL) and 8.8 years (AML). The expression of RHAMM in AML was more than the expression in ALL. The blast percentage after induction therapy, relapse and the prognosis when correlated showed statistically significant negative correlation in both types of leukemia. The presence of more than 10% RHAMM positive cells in the initial biopsy correlated with residual disease, relapse and bad outcome. Conclusion: Significant negative prognostic effect of RHAMM expression is evident in acute pediatric leukemias. The expression was more in AML than ALL. Hence this marker maybe included in the diagnostic panel so that the parents of the patients can be counselled and the treatment can be intensified for a better prognosis. Evolution of an inhibitor for this marker as a promising targeted therapy for these patients warrants further research.",

NICU patients were excluded. Assessment of mobility, VTE risk factors and bleeding risk was required for patients >14 years, and in all ages with prior VTE history or provider concern for VTE. Patients were stratified into 3 risk groups based on a score that incorporated age, immobility and risk factors. Pharmacologic prophylaxis was recommended for patients at high VTE risk, mechanical prophylaxis for moderate VTE risk or high VTE risk with bleeding risk, and no prophylaxis for low VTE risk. HA-VTE was defined as 1) VTE diagnosed \u08d948 hours after hospital admission or 2) VTE diagnosed within 90 days of hospital discharge. Patients with HA-VTE were identified by ICD9 coding and chart review. Results: During 16 months from August 2013 to January 2015, a total of 13,067 patients underwent electronic VTE risk assessment. Provider compliance with completion of screen within 24 hours of admission was 97%. We identified 38 HA-VTE cases for a rate per 10,000 admissions of 29 (95%CI 21-40), similar to a rate of 25 (95%CI 21-29) observed from 2006 to 2013, prior to implementation of the screening tool. The rate of HA-VTE per 10,000 admissions increased with VTE risk: low risk rate was 17 (95%CI 11-26); moderate risk 78 ; high risk 350 (95%CI 188-592). Bleeding was assessed during a 4 month period; the relative risk for patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis was 9.9 (95%CI 3.8-25.3) for all bleeding and 6.8 (95%CI: 2.2-20.6) for major bleeding. Conclusion: An electronic VTE risk assessment tool identified patients at increased risk of HA-VTE. However, VTE rates have not significantly decreased with implementation of the screen, and increased bleeding was associated with pharmacologic prophylaxis. Additional studies are needed to improve risk assessment and prevention strategies. trial, including 34% of younger patients and 24% of older patients, which was statistically significant (P = 0.002). The differences between these rates and those from prior years in both age groups (38% and 27%, respectively) were not statistically significant (P = 0.15, 0.53). In our current data, the most common reason for the low enrollment rates was once again the lack of an open therapeutic trial. There were no statistical differences between the groups when other factors were analyzed. Conclusion: Despite initiatives at CHP and on the national level to enroll more AYA patients on clinical trials, our most recent data shows no improvement. The cause is multifactorial, but the primary reason we have found in our institution is the lack of an open clinical trial. This is a potentially remediable factor that needs to be prioritized nationally by the pediatric and medical oncology community. Objectives: To understand the role of cellular phosphorylation status and the influence of mutation (S34F) in the U2AF1 splicing factor on CSF3R splicing, specifically related to Class I vs Class IV. Design/Method: To study the effect of splicing factor mutations on CSF3R splicing, we constructed a minigene consisting of 5' exon of the CAT gene with an ATG site and a partial intron fused to intron region of CSF3R upstream of Exon 17. The retained intron is present in the exon 17 of CSF3R. We transduced 293FT cells with the minigene \u00b1 wild-type U2AF1 or U2AF1 S34F mutant. Cells were treated with sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) or phorbol myristic acetate (PMA). Na3VO4 inhibits tyrosine phosphatases, whereas PMA promotes activation of the protein kinase C pathway. qPCR was used to determine the expression of Class I and Class IV expression. Results: U2AF1, SRSF2 and SAM68 sites were identified in the nucleotide sequence of the spliced intron. We found that inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activity by Na3VO4 resulted in increased intron excision, but PMA did not. The data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important for intron excision. Exogenous expression of U2AF1 S34F showed a decrease in intron excision, suggesting that the mutation inhibits Class IV transcript formation. Background: Prophylactic factor replacement therapy is increasingly utilized to prevent bleeding complications in severe hemophilia. Increased prophylaxis utilization may lead to decreased admissions for bleeding complications and may alter inhibitor epidemiology. Publication of the \"Joint Outcomes Study\" (JOS) a phase 3 randomized controlled trial of primary prophylaxis in 2007, demonstrated that prophylaxis significantly improves joint outcomes in children with moderate to severe hemophilia A. The high-impact nature of the JOS offers an opportunity to study the epidemiological consequences of increasing prophylaxis use. Objectives: To determine differences in admissions for bleeding episodes and inhibitor bypassing therapies (a surrogate marker for inhibitors) as well as length of stay (LOS) and intensive care (ICU) utilization between timeframes before and after publication of the JOS. (14) were not included to avoid bias related to randomized prophylaxis during the active study period. Data from the remaining hospitals (43) were evaluated. Discharge diagnoses, defined by ICD-9-CM (international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification), along with medication charges were utilized to define bleeding episodes and bypassing therapies.",

            "text": "Results: There was no significant trend in bleeding episodes (bleeding diagnosis and use of factor replacement) or bypassing therapies. The overall LOS was shortened from 5.1 days to 4.5 days (P = 0.0009) and ICU stays decreased from 7% to 3.5% of admissions (P = 0.002) in the post-JOS era. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a decrease in overall hospital LOS and ICU utilization in the post-JOS era. There was no increase in bypass therapy utilization, suggesting that the incidence of inhibitor formation remained stable. These findings cannot be directly attributed to changes in practice resulting from publication of the JOS, since hemophilia severity and utilization of prophylaxis cannot be directly determined from PHIS. However, they suggest that increasing utilization of primary prophylaxis may decrease inpatient utilization without altering inhibitor epidemiology. Objectives: Here we describe the use of CRIPSR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 technology to create mutants in the epigenetic regulator chd1 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1) in zebrafish. Chd1 is known to interact with the spliceosome. Our studies will determine the in vivo importance of this interplay in hematopoiesis. Design/Method: To create double-strand breaks in the chd1 gene in zebrafish, in vitro transcribed guide RNA specific for chd1 and Cas9 protein were microinjected into fertilized zebrafish embryos. These injected F0 founder fish were then mated to generate F1 carriers. The F1 progeny were screened for the presence of a mutated chd1 by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the target region followed by a T7 endonuclease assay for detection of indels. Exact mutations were identified by cloning and Sanger sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. Results: From 13 screened F1 fish, 10 were found to carry mutations in chd1. Of those with mutations, 7 had mutations that are predicted to disrupt protein function through introduction of premature stop codons. Trans-heterozygous chd1 mutant F1 fish were incrossed and no defects in overall morphology or survival were noted, in line with our previous observations using morpholino-antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of chd1. Homozygous mutants for chd1 are now growing and will be characterized for hematopoietic defects and interactions with spliceosomal factors. Conclusion: Use of Crispr/Cas9 technology in zebrafish is an effective way of creating gene-specific mutations in MDS/AML factors to determine their in vivo contribution to disease. Understanding the pathophysiology and interaction between spliceosomal mutation and epigenetic factors will help identify prognostic factors and potentially guide treatment in MDS and AML. , with mild and rest were with severe disease. Family history was positive in 51% and in all the patients who presented before 6 months of age had severe hemophilia. APTT was prolonged in all the patients with the mean value of >1 minute. Severity of disease and family history has significant relation at p<0.005, while relation between severity of disease and the age at diagnosis is significant but compromised at p = 0.05, i.e. critical line. Post circumcision bleed (45.5%) was observed prominently as primary symptom followed by bruises and epistaxis, respectively. Life threatening bleed was reported in 9% and about 66% developed hemarthrosis. Only 2 patients had APTT done before circumcision. Most of the patients were on demand factor replacement therapy (74.6%) and only 5.4% of them were on primary prophylaxis. Conclusion: On the basis of early presentation and family history we can predict the severity of the disease. Performing PT/APTT before circumcision in all children is cost effective screening investigation as early diagnosis, adequate and timely prophylaxis can prevent early and late complications.",

Background: Tobacco use increases the risk of lung and many other tobacco related cancers, with higher risk conferred by longer duration and more intensive tobacco use. Further, tobacco use is associated with other adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and decreased physical fitness, all of which may result in shortened life span.

Cells are added to these plates and treated for 72 hours at which time cell viability is determined. Preliminary work in our laboratory used a library of 56 anti-cancer and targeted agents, which were tested on 16 AML cell lines and 8 ALL cell lines. Biological replicates were performed for each cell line and drug response data in the form of IC50s and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were calculated.

Conclusion: Further testing will include expansion of our drug library and application to ex vivo patient samples. The results from these studies can lead to the establishment of a drug sensitivity and resistance assay that could provide specifically engineered therapies for each patient. This form of precision therapy would lead to diminished toxicities from systemic therapies as well as allow for increased cure rates. Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises 5% of pediatric cancers and reports 5-year event free survival (EFS) of approximately 50% and overall survival (OS) of 60-70% following intensive multi-agent chemotherapy (1) . Anthracyclines are the cornerstone in treatment of AML; however, they are associated with both acute and late cardiac toxicities. Nearly 1 in 10 pediatric patients receiving anthracyclines may develop congestive heart failure (CHF) with higher incidences when cumulative doses exceed 300 mg/m2 (3). Importantly, current AML treatment in children commonly includes anthracyclines doses that are in excess of those known to cause CHF. Objectives: Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) previously adopted a standardized clinical practice of administering dexrazoxane prior to any non-liposomal anthracycline beginning in 2011. We are reporting the differences in cardiac and treatment outcomes in children and young adults with AML treated with and without dexrazoxane at CHW from 2008 to 2013. Design/Method: A retrospective chart review of children ages 0 to 21 years who received chemotherapy for AML at CHW between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013 was performed. Data collected from the electronic medical record included such variables as: anthracycline administration, echocardiogram measurements and relapse status. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software version 9.2 with two sided p value of \u08d8 0.05 considered statistically significant.

While promising, further studies in this patient population are needed to confirm these findings. While it was successful in identification of one medication error before it reached the patient, 19% of prescriptions were not verified. Since prescription bottles are usually obtained after a visit, verification of the actual bottles will require new workflows, such as additional clinic visits or uploading a picture via the patient portal. Involving the nurse in the review of oral chemotherapy not only identified a prescription error, but also highlighted issues within other aspects of patients' care, including a need for patient/family education and inconsistent documentation of the treatment plan. The inclusion of nursing in the review and management of oral chemotherapy has the potential to improve safety and outcomes for these patients. Background: Evidence-based guidelines do not exist for re-vaccination of childhood cancer survivors following chemotherapy. Objectives: To prospectively determine the response rate following re-vaccination with age-appropriate immunizations in this cohort of patients. Design/Method: We conducted a phase II, single center study of patients in remission following chemotherapy, excluding those who received an autologous or allogeneic HSCT. Immune recovery was defined by absolute CD3+4+ >200 cells/\u03bcL, T cell proliferative response to PHA> lower limit normal, and IgG>500mg/dl without supplementation of IVIG. Response to vaccine was defined as seroconversion to a positive titer. Results: Seventy-five patients, 1.1 -19.6 years (median, 9.2 years), 35 males, were enrolled at a median of 4.8 months (range, 3-20.5 months) post-chemotherapy. Patients had ALL (SR = 7, HR = 17); AML (n = 6); Hodgkin Lymphoma (n = 16); Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (n = 4); CNS tumor (n = 17); retinoblastoma (n = 3); germ cell tumor (n = 3); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1); and Wilms tumor (n = 1). Thirty-six patients completed all planned vaccines and follow-up serologic testing, 19 completed at least 75%, 22 completed less than 75%; reasons for incomplete participation included relapse, poor compliance or death. Time to start vaccination ranged from 3 to 21 months (median, 3 months). At base-line, protective titers were absent for 10-25% patients for polio, tetanus, diphtheria, 30-60% MMR, varicella, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae B, >90% for meningococcal (A, C, W and Y), pneumococcal and pertussis. Seropositivity for tetanus, diphtheria, polio, haemophilus influenzae B, hepatitis B, and pneumococcal was >98% at the completion of the trial. The rate of seropositivity for the remaining pathogens were pertussis, 52%; meningococcal A, 94%, C, 58%, Y 61%, W 44%; measles, 69%; mumps, 73%; rubella, 82%; and varicella 72%. Primary disease type was not predictive of response. Conclusion: This study confirms poor residual immunity to many vaccine preventable diseases in childhood survivors of cancer. Re-vaccination with age-appropriate vaccines and schedule may provide protective levels for many pathogens. However, some patients continue to be at risk for pertussis, meningococcal (C,W and Y), MMR and varicella.",

For most diagnoses, patients treated at pediatric oncology centers have much better outcomes, and children treated on standardized protocols do better than those who are not. The Project Every Child Protocol (APEC14B1) was recently launched by COG. This is a registry, eligibility screening, biology and outcome study that requires enrollment in order to participate in any COG treatment study. This requirement may lead to even fewer children of color being able to benefit from COG treatment protocols. Objectives: The goal of this study was to quantify the number of refusals to enroll in the COG registry ACCRN07 by race and ethnicity. Design/Method: We reviewed the database of oncology patients at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota to find patients offered participation in COG study ACCRN07 between April 2008 and December 2015. Data was collected on race and ethnicity as well as refusal to enroll. Racial differences were evaluated using the Fisher exact probability test. Results: A total of 921 patients were offered enrollment on ACCRN07. Information on race/ethnicity was available for 869 children. Of these, 64 families refused enrollment (7.4%). Only 33 of 716 white patients refused enrollment (4.6%). Refusal rates were much higher for patients of color (20.3%, p<0.0001). Asian patients had the highest refusal rate (31.6%, p< 0.0001) followed by our black patients (21.2%, p = 0.0002). Bi-racial, Native American and Hispanic refusal rates were also higher, but only the refusal rate of our bi-racial patients reached statistical significance (p = 0.009).",

The objective was to describe CIPN and balance deficits longitudinally in children during and just following treatment for non-CNS cancers. The impact of diagnosis and chemotherapy type on CIPN were also investigated. Design/Method: Children (N = 66, mean age 11.4\u00b13.5 years, 47% male) being treated for non-CNS cancer were assessed for Pediatric Modified Total Neuropathy Score (ped-mTNS) and balance (Bruininks-Oseretsky Test (BOT-2)) 3 to 6 months into treatment (based on diagnosis) and 3 and 6 month after completion of chemotherapy. Treatment was categorized by neurotoxic drug used (vincristine (V), V + Intrathecal Methotrexate (V+M), or V + Etoposide (V+E)). Results: Ped-mTNS scores decreased over time for the entire group (9.4 \u00b1 4.5 initial, 6.0 \u00b1 4.5 3 mo, 4.2 \u00b1 3.6 6 mo, F = 38.14, p<0.001, effect size = 0.6). After adjusting for age and sex, when compared to those with ALL (N = 26), children with other solid tumors (OST) (n = 15), but not lymphoma (N = 25), had higher ped-mTNS scores during treatment (7.7 \u00b1 3.1 ALL, 8.7 \u00b1 4.6 Lymphoma, 11.8 \u00b1 4.2 OST, F = 3.96, p = 0.02). 6-months post-treatment, both those with lymphoma and OST had higher peds-mTNS scores than those with ALL (2.3 \u00b1 3.1 ALL, 5.7 \u00b1 3.1 Lymphoma, 5.2 \u00b1 3.1 OST, F = 8.38, p < 0.001). Children treated with V+E (n = 20), compared to V (n = 15) or V+M (n = 29), had the highest ped-mTNS scores during treatment (9.3 \u00b1 1.0 V, 7.5 \u00b1 0.7 V+M, 11.5 \u00b1 0.9 V+E) and at 3 and 6 month follow-up.

Neither diagnosis nor treatment were associated with balance recovery at 6 months. Conclusion: While many children who experience CIPN from cancer treatment recover by 6 months post-treatment, those who are treated with vincristine + etoposide may have longer-term nerve dysfunction. All groups improved in balance over time, yet none achieve balance control comparable to population norms.",

Telemedicine is a resource that has the ability to lower the health care costs and bridge a geographic disparity that many patients and families face with a child that requires subspecialty care. However, the willingness to utilize telemedicine comes from both physicians and families. Objectives: Evaluate the cost and satisfaction of patients and families that could use telemedicine to deliver quality care to patients with hematology or oncology diagnoses that live in underserved areas. Design/Method: This is a cross-sectional study. Two subject groups aged 0-21 years old, with a Hematologic or Oncologic diagnosis that live >70 miles from Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City Missouri were evaluated in this study. The experimental group consisted of subjects who follow up at outreach clinics and have telemedicine capabilities. The control group are subjects who do not have outreach clinic options and must travel to Kansas City. A total of 32 patients per group were evaluated. The experimental group answered a cost analysis and a telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire following their telemedicine visit. Whereas the control group answered the same cost analysis and a utilization of telemedicine survey. Results: Study results are preliminary, and anticipated closure is February 2016. At this point in the study, the experimental group is noted: to have saved hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses, families have been able to miss less school and work, a majority thought the telemedicine visit was as good as an in-person visit, and a majority would be willing to utilize telemedicine with subsequent visits in comparison to the control group. Additionally, a majority of the control group would be willing to utilize telemedicine and they believe it would allow their family to save money, and miss less school and work. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first cost-analysis and satisfaction survey evaluating the use of telemedicine in the pediatric hematology oncology population. Preliminary results favor future research investment in telemedicine to care for a subspecialized patient population in underserved communities. ",

Thus, this series provides sufficient evidence for further investigation to determine which patients require interventions to prevent symptomatic hyperammonemia, which patients may have ammonia levels used as an asparaginase activity surrogate and which patients may achieve equivalent efficacy with abridged dosing. Background: Expanded access, also known as compassionate use, programs provide an opportunity for select patients to access investigational drugs, biologics or medical devices outside a clinical trial. A successful expanded access application requires the treating physician to obtain agreement from the pharmaceutical company developing the investigational agent, authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and authorization by the hospital's Institutional Review Board.

As such, there is a heightened awareness of previously under-appreciated long-term treatment-related outcomes, or late effects. The endocrine system, and particularly the growth hormone axis, is particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of current treatment modalities. The presence or absence of growth hormone deficiency and the attainment of final adult height have become the principal measures of interest in current medical literature focusing on height-related late effects. It has been well documented that cranial or craniospinal irradiation has a negative impact on height and that concurrent chemotherapy may intensify the growth deterring effects of radiation. However, the effect of chemotherapy alone on the growth hormone axis and final adult height in the absence of confounding variables such as radiation exposure and/or the presence of a CNS tumor is less well understood. Objectives: To investigate the effect of chemotherapy on the growth velocity of pediatric cancer survivors at various stages off therapy. Design/Method: This study is a retrospective chart review of 71 patients from the oncology long-term follow-up clinic registry at Nationwide Children's Hospital from 1/1/2008 -4/1/2013 who received chemotherapy without radiation and who did not have a primary brain tumor diagnosis. Results: Over the first 5 years off therapy, the percentages of patients with growth velocities at or below the third percentile for their specific age and gender were 14.08%, 18.31%, 26.76%, 22.54%, and 24.56%, respectively. The association of specific cancer types and chemotherapeutic agents on delayed growth velocity will be discussed. Conclusion: Chemotherapy alone can lead to delayed growth velocity in pediatric cancer survivors. Pediatric oncologists and general practitioners should have a low threshold for further work-up including bone age radiographs, growth hormone levels, and placement of an Endocrinology referral when growth delay is noted in this patient population.",

Mucocutaneous findings are pathognomonic for PHTS, including oral papillomatosis on the gingiva, though it may not appear until adolescence or early adulthood. Often, dentists are the first to refer patients for evaluation based on oral papillomatosis, and case reports show adults are being referred by dentists for PTEN evaluation. Individuals with PTEN gene mutations are at risk for several health problems, including vascular anomalies and malignancies of the breast, thyroid, and endometrium, and should be followed by appropriate specialists for recommended surveillance protocols. Early identification of at-risk individuals is of the utmost importance to prevent or treat these symptoms. Objectives: Determine gingival hyperplasia and gingivitis phenotype in cohort of five pediatric patients with PHTS, followed in the Vascular Anomalies Clinic at Texas Children's Cancer Center. Design/Method: Five pediatric patients with confirmed PTEN molecular diagnoses followed in the Vascular Anomalies Clinic at Texas Children's Cancer Center were noted to have a gingival hyperplasia phenotype.

Results: Five of five pediatric patients in the cohort of patients with confirmed PTEN molecular diagnosis have gingival hyperplasia, with dental records confirming moderate to severe gingivitis in three patients. Two dental record reviews are pending. Conclusion: Gingival hyperplasia and gingivitis may be an early indicator of the oral findings associated with PHTS. Pediatric clinical providers, including dentists, seeing patients with macrocephaly, gingival hyperplasia, and gingivitis should consider referral for PHTS evaluation. These may also be indicators to aid in identifying at-risk relatives that may be too young to have yet developed papillomatosis. Pediatric patients with confirmed PHTS should be referred to and followed by dentists for gingival hyperplasia and gingivitis surveillance and treatment.",

            "text": "Background: Many survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exhibit deficits in neurocognitive function following treatment. Despite generally uniform treatment protocols, individual neurocognitive outcomes are not predictable. One potential genetic risk factor for neurocognitive late effects is the apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 allele. This allele has been most strongly associated with increased risk for dementia and also has been implicated as a risk factor for cognitive deficits following various neurological stressors. Central nervous system (CNS)-directed chemotherapy, as utilized in childhood ALL treatment, may be considered a similar insult to the brain. Objectives: To evaluate the association between APOE genotype and neuropsychological functioning following treatment for childhood ALL. Design/Method: Participants were survivors of childhood ALL, treated with chemotherapy only, currently 8 to 18 years of age. During a routine clinic visit, blood was obtained for APOE genotyping, and participants completed a brief neuropsychological assessment battery to evaluate attention, processing speed, memory, and executive function. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were used to detect significant differences in neurocognitive performance variables between groups defined by APOE status while controlling for age, gender, education, and socioeconomic status. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (57.8% male; 51.9% Caucasian; mean age 12.82 years). The average age at time of ALL diagnosis was 5 years, with an average time to completion of treatment of 5 years. Fifteen participants (26.3%) were found to carry the APOE e4 allele. Preliminary results indicate that pediatric ALL survivors who carry the APOE e4 allele have no significant difference in attention, processing speed, memory, or executive function when compared to non-carriers of the e4 allele (all p > 0.05).",

Recently, we have observed that SCA is characterized by a unique cardiomyopathy, with features of both restrictive physiology (diastolic dysfunction, disproportionate left atrial (LA) enlargement and normal systolic function) and an anemia-related hyperdynamic state with ventricular enlargement. Restrictive physiology could lead to secondary elevation in tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and exercise intolerance, independent of pulmonary artery hypertension. Albuminuria is an early manifestation of sickle nephropathy. Albuminuria has been correlated with echocardiography-estimated pulmonary hypertension using TRV as a surrogate measure. Whether the sickle cardiomyopathy correlates with nephropathy is unknown. Objectives: Assess the relationship between sickle cardiomyopathy and albuminuria in SCA. Design/Method: Echocardiograms were performed in individuals with SCA (SS and S\u03b20-thalassemia) participating in a clinical trial of losartan for sickle nephropathy. We analyzed baseline (pre-losartan) results and correlated the cardiac phenotype with urine S40 ASPHO ABSTRACTS albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and hematological markers. Albuminuria was defined as UACR \u08d9 30 mg/g. Results: Thirty-six SCA patients were included (mean age 24.1y; 53% female). Fifteen had normal UACR (mean\u00b1SEM 9.2\u00b11.5 mg/g) while 21 patients had albuminuria (UACR 373\u00b187 mg/g 2\u00b10.3 g/dL, P = 0.04); however, there was no difference in TRV, LV mass, LV diameter or reticulocyte count between groups. 6MWD correlated significantly with the diastolic measures E/A and septal e'/a' (P = 0.013 and P = 0.015, respectively).

Design/Method: Adult patients with a diagnosis of ALL during childhood and off all anti-cancer therapy at least two years were recruited and signed informed consent for both imaging and NC testing. Quantitative 23Na MR imaging at 9.4T provided TSC maps from which regional TSC and BV values were measured. Mean BV values and linear correlations between regional TSC values and BV values were performed for the AS group. Validated NC assessments were performed on the AS group. Relationships between NC scores, regional TSC and BV were examined by Pearson correlation. Results: Ten AS (60% female, mean age 25.4 years) were enrolled. BV was decreased (P<0.015) from age-matched controls and significant inverse linear correlations existed between BV and regional TSC for frontal (p<0.011) & parietal (p<0.004) lobes, basal ganglia (p<0.001) and thalami (p<0.001) but not for temporal (p>0.05) or occipital (p>0.05) lobes (OL) in AS. NC performance was not related to BV. There was a suggestion of increasing NC performance with increasing OL TSC, most prominent in processing speed (p<0.020). Conclusion: Results of this exploratory study showed ALL and its treatment during childhood results in smaller cerebral volume and this decrease is correlated with regional increases in TSC, reflecting decreases in CVF in fronto-parietal and deep gray matter regions. Preliminary results also suggest a possible relationship between OL TSC and processing speed but the etiology of this relationship is unclear.

Objectives: To define the progression of cardiac pathology in SCA and determine the pathophysiology that underlies the diverse reported cardiopulmonary phenotypes including sudden death. Design/Method: Mouse models of SCA and iron-deficient anemia mice underwent a longitudinal comprehensive cardiac analysis, combining state-of-the-art cardiac imaging (cardiac MRI and echocardiography), electrocardiography, histopathology and molecular analysis to determine the basis of cardiac dysfunction. Results: SCA mice showed anemia-induced hyperdynamic physiology, with gradual additional development of restrictive physiology. There was a progressive increase in the left atrial diameter and diastolic dysfunction despite normal systolic function. This restrictive physiology was noticeably absent in chronic iron-deficiency anemia mice. In SCA mice, this was associated with increased extracellular volume by cardiac-MRI and resulted from microscopic myocardial fibrosis. Mitochondrial ultrastructural changes were consistent with severe hypoxia/ischemia/oxidative stress, and significantly shortened sarcomere diastolic lengths were noted. Transcriptionally, genes involving angiogenesis, extracellular-matrix, circadian-rhythm, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress/hypoxia were upregulated and ion-channel transport and fatty-acid metabolism genes were downregulated. A functional interaction network analysis suggested lowered expression of genes essential for normal cardiac conduction. Indeed, prolonged QTc, with remarkably increased prolongations occurring pre-mortem, arrhythmias and ischemic changes were observed prior to sudden death. Conclusion: Collectively, SCA mice developed a distinct sickle cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology from cumulative cardiomyocyte hypoxia/ischemia-induced fibrosis, resulting in an arrhythmogenic myocardium. Sudden cardiac death is common in restrictive cardiomyopathies and prolonged QT syndromes. This comprehensive longitudinal analysis and our finding of this cardiomyopathy in this preclinical SCA mouse model may be the unifying cardiac pathophysiology of the previously reported diverse cardiac phenotypes, which also explains the sudden death seen in this disease. Furthermore, it will also open new avenues for early diagnostics and targeted therapies for human SCA-related cardiac disease.",

Design/Method: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed or relapsed pediatric oncology patients between 11/2/2012 and 5/7/2015. Neuropathic pain was defined a priori as documentation of one or more of the following in the medical record: 1) \"neuropathic pain\"; 2) \"pain\" in a nerve distribution; 3) \"pain\" + qualitative neuropathic pain descriptor (i.e., numb, burning); 4) \"pain\" + initiation of neuropathic pain medication. Demographic variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression (forward stepwise selection method and \u03b1 = 0.10) was performed to find the best set of predictive factors for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. Results: Charts were reviewed for 162 patients. Median (IQR) age at cancer diagnosis was 7.5 (3.2, 13.8) years and 45% were female. Diagnoses included 55% leukemia/lymphoma, 32% solid tumors and 13% central nervous system tumors. Twenty-eight percent (95% CI 21-35%) of patients met our definition of neuropathic pain. Age was not significantly different between those with and without neuropathic pain (p = 0.110), but was significantly lower in those treated with vincristine (median age 5.8 vs. 12.7 years, p = 0.004).

Results: 21 patients experienced a total of 38 episodes of CIAE with symptoms lasting a mean of 5.8 days. Hands and feet were both involved in 71% of initial episodes. CIAE occurred following the administration of cytarabine [22 events in 13 patients (mature B-cell lymphoma in 7 patients, acute myeloid leukemia in 6 patients)] and methotrexate [14 events in 9 patients (ALL in 2 patients; osteosarcoma in 4 patients; and mature B-cell lymphoma in 3 patients, all 3 of whom also had CIAE following cytarabine)]. Administration of both agents together occurred prior to 2 events in 2 patients (both with mature B-cell lymphomas). Parenteral opioids were required for symptom control in 28.6% of patients. No genetic variants reached the genome-wide association threshold of P<5\u00d710-8. The top identified variant was intronic in MSRA (rs17708090, P = 1.09\u00d710-5, OR 7.7), with a risk allele frequency of 27.5% in cases and 9.4% in controls. Additionally, the intronic variant rs13214952 in MTHFD1L was also associated with an increased risk of CIAE (P = 4.25\u00d710-5, OR 5.7), with 90% of patients developing CIAE following methotrexate carrying the risk allele.",

            "text": "Background: Patients with Sickle cell anemia (SCA) have an 11% risk of overt stroke and up to 30% risk of silent infarction during their lifetime. Routine screening with Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) allows for selecting patients with the highest risk and providing chronic transfusions to decrease their risk of stroke by 90 %. Abnormal velocities on TCD are associated not only with an increased risk for stroke, but also with poor cognitive performance and irreversible changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. Even in the absence of MRI abnormalities patients with SCA can experience neurocognitive problems and decline in performance over time. Early laboratory predictors of TCD velocities would allow identification of patients at risk during the first years of life to introduce appropriate treatment modalities and educational support. Objectives: To study the linear correlations of early biomarkers with TCD velocities at different age intervals. Design/Method: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with SCA and Sbeta0thalassemia followed at Marian Anderson Center at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia. We identified 132 consecutive patients who meet inclusion criteria. Pearson correlations were calculated to explore linear associations of steady state biomarkers of anemia, hemolysis and inflammation with patients' maximum left middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities at different age intervals (2 to 6 years, 6 to 11 years, and older than 11 years). Results: In the 2 to 6 year age group, there was a positive linear correlation of TCD velocities of the left MCA with lactate dehydrogenase (n = 51, r = 0.341, p = 0.014), reticulocyte count (n = 92, r = 0.314, p = 0.002) and bilirubin (n = 71, p = 0.037 p = 0.037), white blood cell count (n = 94, r = 0.249, p = 0.015) and a negative linear correlation with hemoglobin (n = 94, r = 0.317, p = 0.002). In the 6-11 year age group the only significant correlation was lactate dehydrogenase (n = 29, r = 0.452, p = 0.014) and no correlation of laboratory biomarkers in the older than 11 age group. Conclusion: Decreased hemoglobin, increased white blood cell count, increased bilirubin and increased lactate dehydrogenase from the first few years of life correlate with increased MCA velocities in the 2 to 6 year age group and may help to identify high risk patients.",

Design/Method: This cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study included assessment of demographic measures and evaluation of data resulting from completion of the REALM-Teen and Newest Vital Sign (NVS) instruments by 75 Black, non-Hispanic adolescents with SCD followed at Children's Medical Center (CMC) in Dallas, Texas. Convenience sampling was utilized. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of one of the four primary genotypes of SCD and age 10-19 years. UT Austin and UT Southwestern Institutional Review Boards approved the study. Results: Thirty-seven males and 38 females were recruited for the study. Their mean age was 14.7 years (SD = 2.2; range 8.1). Their grade level ranged from 4 to 12 (mean 8.7; SD = 2.2). The following SCD genotypes were represented: SS (81.3%); SC (14.7%); S\u03b2+ (2.7%) and S\u03b20 (1.3%). Scores on the REALM-Teen ranged from 12 to 66 (mean 53.7; SD = 12.8). Scores on the NVS ranged from 0 to 6 (mean 2.37; SD = 1.33). These health literacy scores were lower using both the REALM-Teen and the NVS instruments when compared to scores in healthy adolescent and adult controls. However, the mean REALM-Teen score of this sample was slightly higher than Black controls from the validation study. Current grade level and health literacy scores showed a moderately high positive correlation (r = .52, p < .01). Health literacy scores were also significantly positively correlated with age (r = .49, p < .01) and income (r = .37, p < .01). Conclusion: Health literacy in adolescents with SCD appears to be suboptimal. Future research should include identifying facilitators and barriers to health literacy levels in a larger cohort of adolescents with SCD. Ratzan, S. C., & Parker, R.

Studies show that this growing cohort of young adult SCD patients aged 18-26 years old experiences a marked rise in medical complications and early mortality, coinciding with decreased use of life-prolonging therapies and increased use of emergency care. Objectives: We surveyed SCD patients who previously transitioned to adult care to determine: 1) If they currently had an adult SCD provider, 2) If they continued their pre-transition therapies, and 3) Their perception of the transition process. Design/Method: 441 SCD patients transitioned from pediatric care at Texas Children's Hematology Center (TCHC) between 01/1999 and 01/2014. We contacted these patients at their last known address and phone number to request completion of a 23 question survey assessing patient demographics, post-transition medical outcomes, and personal experiences. Results: 48 surveys were completed. 17 patients (35.4%) lack a provider, with top reasons being lack of insurance/funding (44%) and \"can't find a physician\" (38%). Patients without an adult physician within 6 months of transition were less likely to have a physician currently (p<0.017). 83.3% of patients on hydroxyurea as pediatric patients (15/18) continued hydroxyurea therapy after transition. Subjects reported difficulties with finding knowledgeable adult providers, medical insurance, and inadequate transition preparation. Examples of qualitative results include comments such as the following: \"The adult doctors are not aware of the disease \u2026They have to call the pediatricians.\" While another said, \"[It was] hard finding a physician in the two years after TCHC [because of insurance loss] \u2026 my health worsened because I wasn't getting the medication that I needed.\" When asked, 94% of patients wanted a dedicated SCD transition clinic. 12 patients were identified as deceased from all causes. Conclusion: This survey shows that the first 6 months after transition is a critical period in identifying a sickle cell healthcare provider, supporting the need for a dedicated transition clinic to facilitate transition for SCD patients. It also quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrates that lack of sickle cell focused healthcare providers for adults is a barrier to successful transition.",

The relative role of age when ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) are taken into account has not been addressed. Objectives: We sought to determine the impact of age on the number and/or maximum grade of chemotherapy-related toxicities during induction while controlling for BMI, ethnicity, and gender. Design/Method: Consecutive non-Down Syndrome patients with HR ALL aged >1 and < 22 years at diagnosis, treated on or as per the Children's Oncology Group protocols AALL0232/AALL1131, over the past 10 years, were identified through the pediatric oncology registry at Children's Health. A retrospective chart review was conducted and all toxicities graded using the CTCAEv4 system. Patient characteristics were summarized by quartile of age at diagnosis. Unadjusted trends between toxicity outcomes and age were tested using the Jonckheere-Terpstra nonparametric method. Trends between toxicity outcomes and age adjusted for BMI, ethnicity, and gender were tested using Poisson regression models. Results: The 158 patients experienced 69 distinct toxicities. Common toxicities included febrile neutropenia (FN), sepsis, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. There were 4 deaths during induction (ages > 13 at diagnosis). We omitted FN in analyses since patients did not have an infection. Unadjusted trends between age at diagnosis and both maximum grade of toxicity and number of grade 3-5 toxicities are significant with p = 0.011 and 0.009, respectively. However, multiple regression analysis indicates that when the relationships between age at diagnosis and toxicity are adjusted for BMI, ethnicity, and gender, the relationships are no longer significant. Conclusion: Age was not a significant risk factor for a higher number or greater severity of chemotherapy-related toxicity when adjusted for BMI, ethnicity, and gender. This ASPHO ABSTRACTS S45 research will allow for better supportive care measures and counseling of patients and their parents with respect to the risks associated with ALL therapy.",

However, the ability to identify and follow these cohorts relies on the use of a valid computable phenotype consisting of a defined set of data elements in the form of a computable query to an EMR data warehouse. Although such computable phenotypes have previously identified patient populations with various conditions, a computable phenotype has not yet been developed to identify patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Objectives: To develop a computable phenotype identifying our patient population with SCD using an algorithm approach and to validate and refine the computable phenotype as a means of improving its accuracy. Design/Method: This retrospective study utilized our computable phenotype to search our EMR data warehouse. Eligible patients included those ages 0-18 years, diagnosed with a qualifying SCD ICD-9 code, and being followed by the SCD clinic at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. The computable phenotype was developed as a series of queries to the data warehouse aimed at identifying our patient population with SCD. These queries included patients with a qualifying diagnosis of SCD who also had two outpatient visits at least 30 days apart or one hospitalization in the EMR. Validation studies using medical record numbers from the clinical program database were run against the results of the queries. Results: The computable phenotype identified 352 patients. Of these patients, 350 were confirmed to meet the inclusion criteria. Two patients identified by the computable phenotype were incorrectly identified as having SCD. The computable phenotype failed to identify 2 patients meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, the computable phenotype accurately identified 350 of 354 (98.9%) patients known to fit the inclusion criteria. Conclusion: The advent of EMRs provides a unique opportunity to track and follow known cohorts of patients with a given disease and is a rich resource for future clinical trials. The computable phenotype developed in this study allows for rapid and accurate identification of pediatric patients with SCD and provides a distinct advantage over administrative claims methods.",

A daily evaluation of pain can provide important insight on the clinical consequences of SCD that is not obtained from occasional inpatient or outpatient healthcare visits. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties (validity, reliability and responsiveness) of the Modified FPS-R in pediatric patients with SCD. Design/Method: This evaluation was conducted in the context of a randomized, multinational clinical study in pediatric patients with SCD, 7 to <18 years of age. Symptom intensity was reported in a daily diary during the 2 week screening period/prior to randomization starting at Visit 0 through Month 9. The Modified FPS-R asks patients to consider their pain related to SCD, and report their worst pain over the course of a day. Mean monthly scores were calculated based on the number below the chosen face selected by the patient (\"0\" = \"no pain\", \"10\" = \"worst pain possible\"). Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for test-retest reliability between Month 1 and Month 2. Pearson correlation between monthly mean intensity of sickle-cell-related pain and analgesic use and narcotic use was conducted to assess convergent validity. Responsiveness was assessed with correlations of calculated changes from baseline corresponding to changes in analgesic use and change in activity score from Month 1 to Month 9. Results: ICC was 0.77 (n = 42) indicating agreement among stable patients; moderate associations were shown between the Modified FPS-R and analgesic use (r = 0.39) and narcotic use (r = 0.44); and moderate-to-large associations were observed between the Modified FPS-R and change in analgesic use 0.39 (p<0.001) and activity scores 0.92 (p<0.001).",

The average rate of citrulline appearance, Rapp, was 11.1umol/hr/kg (+/-2.8 SD) and the average constant for citrulline removal, Krem was 1.06 (+/-0.19 SD). The mean clearance was 0.52L/hr/kg with a volume of distribution of 0.50L/kg. All subjects had a significant rise in their arginine level within one hour of receiving the bolus IV citrulline (mean increment of 182%). One subject transiently dropped the diastolic blood pressure by >20% within 30 minutes of study drug with no intervention needed. There were no other reported side effects. Further analysis using a simulated dosing scheme shows that a 20 mg/kg bolus dose of IV citrulline followed by a continuous infusion of 7 mg/kg/hour is needed to maintain the target citrulline concentration. Conclusion: Bolus intravenous L-citrulline is safe and well tolerated in patients with SCD but has a rapid clearance. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of continuous dose IV citrulline in SCD, including its effect on NO production as a potential novel therapeutic option for sickle cell pain crisis. Background: Asthma is a common comorbid condition in patients with sickle cell disease. It has been well reported that patients with sickle cell and asthma have increased risk of morbidity and mortality, especially in regards to acute chest syndrome.

Design/Method: Following development of a comprehensive institutional database, 68 of 223 patients were identified with sickle cell disease and comorbid asthma ages 6 to 12 years of age. An additional 43 patients were identified as phenotypic and age-matched controls. Rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, association with respiratory symptoms, and use of asthma controller medications were retrospectively analyzed over a 5 year period. Data collection and interpretation were accompanied by review of existing literature. Results: Over the study period, patients with sickle cell and asthma had an increased frequency of acute chest presentations and other respiratory symptoms, as previously established. Of note, a similar increase was seen in pain presentations (4.14 compared to 1.5 hospital encounters per patient). While results did not definitively show causation between respiratory symptoms and onset of vaso-occlusive crises, the data suggest a direct correlation. Additionally, a statistically significant association between use of asthma controller medications and patients presenting with pain was identified (p<0.05). Conclusion: Asthma management may have a role in the treatment of sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis as evidenced by more frequent pain presentations in patients with asthma, as well as, a correlation in those patients on controller therapy.

The most common subtypes were AML AML M3 and M5, each representing 28%. According to cytogenetic analysis, 49% AML with recurrent abnormalities, and of these 56% were promyelocytic AML, Background: Cerebrovascular disease is a severe complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) affecting 25-30% of patients1. The most common cerebrovascular events in SCD patients are ischemic, however there is an increase in hemorrhages in the 3rd decade of life attributed to Moyamoya disease2. Ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are thought to be responsible for 2% of intracranial hemorrhages in SCD. The incidence and prevalence of IAs remain unknown in SCD. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of IAs in a cohort of SCD patients who had not suffered stroke or been identified with an abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD). Design/Method: Retrospective review of the SCD database to identify patients meeting the objective who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) screening for headache or other non-stroke indication. Time period included patients scanned from 2010-2015. Demographic information collected included age (at scan), gender, genotypes, IAs, the indication for imaging, and management. All included patients didn't report history of stroke or abnormal TCD. Results: Forty-three patients average age 18.20 years (SD = 7.43) were included. Five of forty-three patients (11.6%) imaged by MRI/MRA were found to have incidental unruptured IAs. Four patients (80%) had HbSS and one patient had HbSbeta+. All patients were asymptomatic. Multiple aneurysms were seen in 3/5 patients (75%). IAs were located at both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation territory. 4/5 (80%) patients were managed conservatively with follow up scans. 1 patient was taken to the OR for aneurysm coiling and resection of an arterio-venous malformation. Conclusion: The 11.6% prevalence of unruptured IAs in this cohort is much higher than the 3.2% reported prevalence of IAs in the general population3. SCD patients with IAs are likely at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage as they age. None of the patients included in this cohort had a history of abnormal TCD. Larger prospective studies are needed to accurately identify the prevalence, outcomes and optimal management of unruptured IAs in SCD. Additionally, maintaining a high index of suspicion for IAs in SCD patients with neurologic symptoms is necessary. This study is limited due to a small sample size of selected population.",

The use of CAM is increasing among the Canadian pediatric population, but the incidence within pediatric oncology is not known. Objectives: To determine the incidence of CAM use within a Canadian pediatric oncology population. Design/Method: A questionnaire was developed and completed by parents/guardians of pediatric oncology patients (aged 0 to 18 years old) at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario from January 2015 to July 2015. The questionnaire on CAM included reasons for use or non-use, types practiced, frequency of use, unwanted side effects, satisfaction of therapy, amount spent and supervision. Demographic characteristics, including ethnicity, marital status, level of education and profession were also collected. Results: Of the 62 respondents, 61% of parents reported using CAM during their child's cancer treatment. Of those not using CAM therapies, the most common reason to not use CAM was that CAM \"may interfere with the medicinal therapies my child is on\" and that CAM \"is not scientifically based\" (n = 25%). Of those that used CAM therapies, the most commonly used modality was prayers/faith (n = 35%). Females (\u03bc = 61.0%) and males (\u03bc = 61.9%) were equally likely to use CAM. Ethnicity played a role in CAM use, as 100% of those that identified as European or Aboriginal used CAM, whereas approximately half of those that identified as Canadian (\u03bc = 57.4%), French (\u03bc = 50.0%), Asian (\u03bc = 60.0%) and African (\u03bc = 50.0%) used CAM. Parents who identified as married were least likely to use CAM (\u03bc = 59.8%) and those that were widowed were most likely to use CAM (\u03bc = 100.0%). Parents who completed a university degree were least likely to use CAM (\u03bc = 53.25%) and those who attained a college degree were most likely to use CAM (\u03bc = 70.0%). Only 57% of patients discussed their CAM use with a physician. Conclusion: There is significant variation in HU prescribing practices, even within a regional consortium. Protocoled guidelines and more study into pediatric use of hydroxyurea is needed to optimize prescribing practices and its impact in sickle cell disease.",

More cases were diagnosed with asthma which may be why they were treated with ICS on admission despite less severe ACS. Overall, initiation of ICS did not decrease ACS morbidity as measured by the need for transfusion, oxygen supplementation, or PICU intervention. While systemic steroids increase the risk of readmission for VOC, cases were not more likely to be readmitted after the use of ICS. Despite a plausible pathogenic mechanism to reduce airway hyperreactivity, our study did not demonstrate a significant benefit of ICS in the treatment of ACS.",

The interaction of healthcare providers (HCPs) and hospital staff with patients and families at the end of a child's life and after death profoundly affects the parental grief experience, offering a unique opportunity for the medical community to positively impact the bereavement experience. Objectives: To explore the role of the health care team and the institution in the grief journeys of parents who lost a child to cancer. Design/Method: Eleven bereaved parents participated in 2 focus groups. Responses to each of the 3 main prompts were coded and analyzed independently using semantic content analysis techniques. Results: Four main concepts were identified within the parental narratives, including the importance of strong and ongoing relationships between HCPs and bereaved families, the importance of high quality communication between HCPs and families, the effect of negative experiences between HCPs and families on parental grief, and the importance of the institution's role in the grief journeys of bereaved parents. Conclusion: Bereaved parents consistently identify the critical role played by HCPs and medical institutions throughout the grief journey.

            "text": "Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with airway hyper-reactivity (AHR), and with augmented inflammation and leukotriene production, known mediators of AHR. Zileuton is a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in the leukotriene synthetic pathway, and is licensed for asthma. However, its safety/pharmacokinetics is not investigated in patients with SCD, where liver and renal functions are often compromised. We hypothesized that zileuton will be safe in patients with SCD, with pharmacokinetics similar to asthma Objectives: The primary objective was to determine safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of twice daily administration of ZL (Zyflo CR) in patients with SCD. Design/Method: We employed a 3\u00d73 dose escalation/de-escalation design of twice daily zileuton for 6 weeks. Nine patients 7-30 years of age with SCD at steady state, who were not on hydroxyurea or chronic transfusions, were enrolled. Pharmacokinetics was performed after the first dose, using a Bayesian model. Total zileuton exposure was defined by the area under the concentration-time curve between zero and 24h (AUC0-24h) normalized by dose Results: Zileuton was well tolerated at doses of 2400mg/day and 3000mg/day. No significant changes in any clinical or laboratory safety parameters occurred. Adverse events were limited to grade-1/2, the most common being pain and hypertension. Pharmacokinetic parameters of zileuton were [mean, (CV %)]: plasma clearance (CL/F) 0.53 L/h/kg (36.4%); volume of distribution (V/F) 1.12 L/Kg (32%); absorption rate constant (Ka) 0.12 1/h (82.2%); elimination phase half-life (t1/2) 1.52 h (24.4%); AUC0-24h (per 1200 mg) 52.61 \u03bcg\u00b7h/ml (45.7%). The population CL/F estimate of 0.51 L/h/kg in the NONMEM analysis was consistent with MWPharm results (0.53 L/h/kg). Variability was smaller when CL/F and V/F were normalized to body mass, suggesting that differences in body weight helped to explain some variability. The coefficient of determination (R2) between body weight and CL/F was 0.44 (P < 0.1), and the R2 between body weight and V/F was 0.40 (P < 0.1). Conclusion: This phase-1 trial demonstrates that zileuton was safe, well tolerated by patients with SCD although there was significant inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability; and warrants a future phase 2/3 trial to study its efficacy in reducing AHR and associated pulmonary morbidity in SCD.",

Research into the parent's perspective of the quality of end of life care of their cancer children are scarce, particularly in developing countries like India. Objectives: This study aimed to identify the symptoms (medical/social/emotional) that most concerned parents during the last days of their child's life and to identify the strategies parents found to be helpful during this period. Design/Method: Parents who lost their child to cancer, treated in our institution were interviewed with a validated prepared questionnaire. Results: 50 % of them were able to understand the concept of palliation vs curative option while 20 % could not understand at all. 80% of them were able to come in terms with palliative mode of treatment while 20 % could not. Only 40 % of them opted for alternative medicine and 70 % of them accepted that it worsened the symptoms. 60 % of them wanted their child to be at the hospital during the period of death and 40 % opted home to be the place of death. When questioned about what made them to opt for aggressive therapy towards the end of life, 60% reported that they hoped for a miracle, while 30 % wanted to do everything possible to reduce the suffering. Retrospectively, 70% of them felt that what they did was right as they wanted to help the child in all possible ways. Towards death, dullness (30%), irritability (30%) and withdrawn from surroundings (10%) were the most common symptoms encountered. 30 % of the children had fear to be alone. 50% of the children had the fear of death. Pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, were the main distressful symptoms that these child suffered from parent's perspective. Conclusion: In developing countries, with scarce financial resources and the increasing magnitude of competing problems, little resources are left for hospice and palliative care services. However, the human factor should not be underestimated, and as end of life of care is far more than medical treatments and pain killers. Greater attention should be paid to symptom control and overall well-being of the child on end of life care.",

Complications include: pain crises, chronic fatigue, organ damage, infections, acute chest syndrome and stroke. Research shows that health related quality of life suffers along with daily activities. Stem cell transplant is an option for eligible patients. Cure by transplant can markedly improve quality of life, but how patients perceive this benefit is not clear. Objectives: The goal of this study was to explore self-reports of the effects of SCD on work or school along with common themes regarding participants' perspectives on life without SCD. The hypotheses were that patients (1) perceive greater disability of SCD as they age, and (2) recognize that transplant could relieve them of that disability. Design/Method: Mixed methods surveys were administered in person to patients seen at the UI Health Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center hospital, pediatric clinic, or adolescent transition clinic. Participant ages ranged from 10 to 40+. Exclusion criteria were: respiratory or contact isolation or extreme pain. Qualitative responses were examined using thematic analysis. Results: Themes identified by all ages about the effect of SCD on work and school included \"Disability,\" \"School absence,\" and \"Motivation to disprove odds.\" Thematic analysis identified that patients would live their lives differently if cured: \"More energy to improve myself,\" \"New educational goals\", \"Career aspirations.\" The potential that stem cell transplant would relieve their disability was recognized by nearly all subjects. Older age correlated significantly (P< 0.02) with responses that as relieving their disability, and almost universally the patients would pursue more in their career or education if cured. Conclusion: Advances in transplantation for SCD can achieve cure for adults and often reduces disability from pain. Heightened perception of benefits by adults supports the important role of adult SCD transplant programs. This survey is the first to examine perception of disability among the factors that patients consider in their decision about stem cell transplant for sickle cell. Further, few studies include both adolescent and adult sickle cell patients in a single survey, and this opens the door on age-related differences in perception of stem cell transplantation. Background: Families and caregivers of pediatric oncology patients can get overwhelmed when coping with the multitude of tasks required to maintain health, much less improve health. Although Children's Hospitals are loving and caring environments, there is no place like home. Objectives: Our goal in 2015 was to transform care delivery of a largely inpatient focused solid tumor chemotherapy team into one that could provide outpatient forward observation. This involved: a) facilitating outpatient chemotherapy, b) anticipating and preventing side effects, c) improving nutrition, d) providing resources to enable families and caregivers to take more active roles, and d) encouraging a \"forward observer\" mind set. Design/Method: Tools used to facilitate and foster forward observation and more active participation in improving health included: 1-improved EMR notes using the Snipping Tool to embed calendars, images, and photos into EMR notes for better team communication, 2-web resources (lotsahelpinghands.org; chemocare.org or ASPHO chemo; disease oriented groups such as ACOR for osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma), 3provision of calendars for families, pharmacy, and infusion nurses, 4-one-page summaries of care (including contact information, previous treatments) which provide the relevant clinical details to facilitate meaningful discussions during clinic visits and improved anticipation of plans and tasks, 5-flash drives containing articles+ nutrition info, images, calendars+ roadmaps, and summaries for caregivers, 6-advance directives information, 7-after-visit-summaries, and 8-creating things to look forward to (make-a-wish, college scholarships).",

Indications for CTT were prior stroke (2) and abnormal TCD (1). Surveillance magnetic resonance angiography showed progressive CNS vasculopathy. Spleens measured 9.5-13.5 cms. There was no evidence of alloimmunization. After careful consideration, these patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy. Mean hematologic parameters were compared by paired t-tests 6 months pre and post splenectomy. Results: Prior to splenectomy, mean pre-transfusion Hb was 7.4 gm/dL, reticulocyte count 20.7%, and Hb S 56%. Post splenectomy Hb was 9.5 gm/dL, reticulocyte count 3%, and Hb S 17%. Following splenectomy, there was a mean reduction in Hb S of 39.77% (95% CI 34.3-45.3, p<0.001). With a mean follow-up of 19 months, there were no perioperative or infectious complications. One patient appeared to have reduced iron burden with a mean reduction in baseline serum ferritin of 1,500 ng/mL, perhaps in part because his transfusions were spaced out due to improved Hb S control. Conclusion: This data suggest splenic sequestration may cause shortened red cell survival resulting in suboptimal Hb S control and increased risk of incident or recurrent stroke. Splenectomy may be a reasonable therapeutic option for select high-risk patients. Additional research is warranted into the causes of variable Hb S control in patients with SCD on CTT so that therapeutic options can be refined to reduce the risk of overt stroke. Background: Timely antibiotic administration in febrile neutropenic patients has been associated with improved outcomes. Analysis of our inpatient BMT unit revealed only 50% of patients with new onset fever received antibiotics within 60 minutes. The aim of this project was to increase the percentage of febrile BMT inpatients receiving antibiotics within 60 minutes, from 50% to 75% by October of 2015 using the Model for Improvement. Objectives: 1. Recognize the importance of timely antibiotic administration in immunocompromised patients2. Identify potential barriers to timely antibiotic administration3. Demonstrate the importance of establishing a standardized process for provider notification, antibiotic order entry and administration Design/Method: Through Pareto analysis and Failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), we identified variables and underlying causes associated with delays. Pareto analysis revealed: orders placed by the providers, delays in pharmacy processing, delays in order placement, and delays in notification of new onset fever were associated with 80% of failures. FMEA revealed insufficient awareness of pharmacy, nursing, and providers of new onset fever; no standardized ordering process; and lack of provider and nursing accountability as likely causes of timely antibiotic delivery failures. From these findings, we created key drivers and through small tests of change developed a standardized process consisting of: 1) bedside nurse notifying ordering provider, charge nurse, and safety coach of a febrile patient, 2) a standardized order set specifically used for inpatients with their first fever, 3) pharmacy notification of a newly febrile patient via a STAT sticker printing off when antibiotics were entered via the order set. We monitored compliance with the process via a software monitoring system called VigiLanz. Results: After implementing an antibiotic order set and developing a process in which the bedside nurse notified both the charge nurse and safety coach of a febrile patient, we saw an increase in the percentage of patients receiving antibiotics within sixty minutes of documented fever from a median of 55% to 80%. Our median time for antibiotic administration decreased from about 60 minutes to 45 minutes. Conclusion: Implementation of a standardized process for provider notification and order entry has resulted in improved times to antibiotic administration in our patients. A month later, she received two cycles of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 with good response. In January 2015, the platelet count went back to 12\u00d7109/L and she received a third course of Rituximab with no sustainable response. It was then decided to introduce Romiplostin in February at a starting dose of 2 mcg/kg and was increased to a maximal dose of 5 mcg/kg. Within a month, she had normalized her platelet count (from 9 to 444\u00d7109/L). Romiplostin was then titrated as per standard recommendation to maintain platelet count between 50 and 200\u00d7109/L. Although platelet count remained stable, ofatumumab was further given one month later to avoid relapse of the other immune manifestation of SLE. Given sustained normal platelet count, romiplostin was gradually weaned and ceased in September 2015. The medication was well tolerated and the patient did not experienced any side-effects nor any pain crisis. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of utilization of Romiplostin in a patient with SCD. The medication was efficacious and well tolerated. In particular, no increase in pain crisis was noted. In contrast to GCSF, romiplostin might safely be used in SCD.

An ACS severity assessment tool has been utilized in research but not validated in the real-world setting. Existing guidelines including from NHLBI do not provide a uniform grading for ACS severity. In contrast, evidence for role of incentive spirometry in preventing and decreasing severity of ACS is strong and incentive spirometry recommendations are included in guidelines. Objectives: To assess the current knowledge of resident physicians and nurses regarding two aspects of ACS: Severity assessment and Incentive spirometry. Design/Method: Our tertiary care hospital admits over 20 patients with SCD per month on the pediatric floor. Pediatric residents and nurses learn about ACS management and prevention through 2 didactic sessions on SCD/year and bedside teaching. An anonymous survey was administered to 40 pediatric residents/20 pediatric nurses who routinely engage in care of ACS patients. This was followed by a house-staff education session on ACS. Results: SEVERITY SCORING: 15% residents/5% nurses had been educated on the use of ACS severity assessment in past. An overwhelming 92% felt that a scoring system would be useful for assessing their patient's condition and guiding management, however only 5% residents /3% nurses had used a severity scoring for ACS in the past. A clinical vignette on ACS was answered incorrectly by 60% of the residents and nurses. INCENTIVE SPIROMETRY: 91% responded they were aware that incentive spirometry can decrease the severity of and improve outcomes of ACS. 90% of residents/95% nurses thought that the patients are compliant less than 50% of the time with incentive spirometry which is almost always ordered.",

Measles in recipients of immunosuppressive chemotherapy can have mortality rates up to 50%. Up to 35% of children < 7 Years lose humoral immunity to measles as a result of chemotherapy induced alterations in immune system. Despite proven strategies of the WHO for improving measles vaccine coverage, the disease still continues to circulate leading to outbreaks in developed countries. In 2015, the US experienced a major measles outbreak related to an amusement park in California. 189 cases (40% < 18 years) were reported across 24 states including our state. Measles is highly contagious from 48 hours prior to the first symptoms. Our pediatric oncology practice shares office and floor space with other pediatric practices, placing our patients at risk for measles infection. Objectives: Measles protective humoral immune status was checked in our patients because of the new risk of Measles in the period of the outbreak from January-June 2015. At the time, it was not our standard practice to check measles titer prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Design/Method: Patients <21 years receiving chemotherapy between January 2015-June 2015 in our department were included in the prospective review. We defined immunity according to our lab standards. Results: A total of 21 (13 female) patients were included. Three patients (15%) had non protective measles antibody levels. 2 of the patients were < 3 years at diagnosis and had leukemia, one was an adolescent with sarcoma. All three came weekly to the clinic and were admitted to floor for chemotherapy during this period and thus shared the common clinic and floor space. None of the patients developed measles.

Results: Our cohort included 70 patients with SCD (39 males and 31 females), with an age ranging between 4 and 18 years. According to their transfusion need prior to surgery, the patients were categorized into 3 groups; namely: no transfusion (group I), simple transfusion (group II) and exchange transfusion (group III).

Vasoocclusive crisis occurred in a comparable number of cases in all three groups (2, 1 and 1 respectively). Acute chest syndrome developed in 1 patient in both non-transfusion group and exchange transfusion group, and 2 patients in simple transfusion group. The pre-transfusion average hemoglobin value was significantly lower in simple transfusion group in comparison to the other 2 groups. Of note, patients with simple transfusion required almost half blood volume compared to those with exchange transfusion (9.1+/-3.3 ml/kg vs. 17.7+/-6.7 ml/kg), with statistically highly significant difference between both groups (p = 0.000).",

Objectives: 1) compare RVGLS and LVGLS in pediatric SCD with other pediatric non-sickling hemolytic anemias, 2) investigate the association of age, disease-modifying therapies, TRV, and global longitudinal strain in SCD. Design/Method: Prospective measurement of RVGLS and LVGLS by speckle-tracking and TRV by 2D M-mode echocardiography in children with Hb-SS and HbS\u03b20thalassemia (n = 151) and non-sickling hemolytic anemias (hereditary spherocytosis, Hb-E, pyruvate kinase deficiency; n = 16) ages 5-19 performed with central reading by one single cardiologist. TRV was categorized as normal (<2.5 m/s) or elevated (\u08d9 2.5 m/s). Results: In univariate analysis, increased (worsening) RVGLS and LVGLS were associated with age and any disease-modifying therapy in children with SCD (p = 0.00011 and 0.029). When controlling for age in a multivariate model, however, treatment was no longer associated with strain. For each 1 year increase in age, there is an increase in RVGLS of 0.26 (p = 0.0016). Elevated TRV was associated with increased LVGLS in SCD (rho = -0.17, p = 0.048). In non-sickling hemolytic anemias, age was associated with increased LVGLS (rho = 0.63, p = 0.096). LVGLS but not RVGLS was significantly decreased in SCD compared with non-sickling hemolytic anemias (-22.6 vs. -21.4, p = 0.049). More patients with SCD had elevated TRV compared with non-sickling hemolytic anemias (26.4 % vs. 0%, p = 0.029). Conclusion: Global longitudinal cardiac strain declines with age in children with hemolytic anemias and may represent an early marker of pathologic cardiac change. Elevated TRV was more common in SCD than in non-sickling hemolytic anemias and may modulate LVGLS. Global longitudinal strain should be further studied in longitudinal prospective cohorts of patients with hemolytic anemias for its value as a marker of early cardiac damage.",

            "text": "Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial malignancy of childhood. The Myc family of proteins regulates cell growth and proliferation and has been implicated in the etiology of many cancers, and MYCN amplified neuroblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis. Investigating specific tumor pathways will further our understanding of neuroblastoma pathogenesis and lead to future therapeutic options. Mxi1 is a member of the MAD family that inhibits N-Myc activity. Mxi0 is an alternatively spliced variant of Mxi1 with a different first exon (Exon 0) whose function has not been determined. Objectives: Test the hypothesis that Mxi1 and Mxi0 differentially impact N-Myc-dependent neuroblastoma cell proliferation. Design/Method: We expressed Mxi1 and Mxi0 in SHEP neuroblastoma cells, and SHEP cells stably transfected to express high levels of MYCN (SHEP/MYCN). We also utilized native neuroblastoma cell lines with inducible expression of Mxi1 and Mxi0. Cell proliferation and survival were quantified using BrdU and MTT assays, respectively. The impact of Mxi1 and Mxi0 on N-Myc expression was measured by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Results: Overexpression of Mxi1 inhibits neuroblastoma cell viability. Conversely, overexpression of Mxi0 in neuroblastoma cell lines leads to increased viability, suggesting that Mxi0 has a counter-regulatory role to that of Mxi1. Further examination reveals that these changes in viability are partially due to changes in cell proliferation, with Mxi1 decreasing proliferation and Mxi0 augmenting it. Additionally, we observed that N-Myc levels decrease in response to Mxi1 expression, and increase when Mxi0 is expressed. Compared with Mxi1, expression of Mxi0 results in enhanced chemoresistance of neuroblastoma cells to doxorubicin or etoposide. Conclusion: Overexpression of Mxi1 in neuroblastoma cell lines leads to inhibition of N-Myc-mediated cell proliferation, while Mxi0 appears to promote cell growth. Mxi1 expression enhances chemosensitivity of neuroblastoma cells, while Mxi0 has the opposite effect. These effects may partially be due to alterations in N-Myc expression. A better understanding of the interactions among Mxi1, Mxi0 and N-Myc and how the relative expression levels of these proteins affect neuroblastoma physiology may aid in developing more effective targeted therapies to improve outcomes in pediatric neuroblastoma patients.",

The United States Preventive Services Task Force, CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend screening different age groups and populations based on IDA risk and the potential for subsequent poor outcomes. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of screening for IDA at varying ages within both a high risk group and the general population. Design/Method: We used a Markov decision analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for IDA in 9, 12 or 18 month-olds within high-risk groups or the entire population. Identical hypothetical cohorts were evaluated over 27 months, tracking anemia severity over time and the possibility of neurodevelopmental outcomes with undiagnosed severe anemia. Clinical outcomes, utilities and costs were all obtained via literature review. We varied parameter estimates in one-way sensitivity analyses. Results: In the base case, screening high-risk 9 month olds gained 0.0054 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost $4.49 more than no screening, or $838/QALY gained. Screening all 9 month olds cost $5593/QALY gained, and screening all 12 month olds cost $15,403/QALY gained. Other strategies were eliminated due to dominance. Using an accepted standard of $50,000 dollars/QALY gained as being cost effective, screening all 12 month olds is the most cost effective strategy. Varying the most uncertain variables in our model over plausible ranges, specifically probability of neurodevelopmental outcomes, probability of anemia in high-risk populations, and the probability of being high-risk, the preferred strategy remained screening all 12 month olds. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, varying all parameters simultaneously over plausible distributions resulted in screening all 12 month olds being favored in 99.98% at a $100,000/QALY threshold. Conclusion: Screening all children at 12 months of age for IDA is an economically reasonable strategy. In light of this, reexamination of the various currently suggested guidelines may be warranted.",

Despite advances in therapy, including a multimodal approach, high risk neuroblastoma remains very difficult to treat. Current long term survival rates for high risk neuroblastoma are approximately forty percent. Biologically targeted novel therapeutics are potential treatments for neuroblastoma that could improve cure rates. Aberrant growth factor receptor (GFR) expression and receptor kinase signaling are associated with the pathogenesis of many malignancies. These kinases therefore serve as targets for a number of novel therapies. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) activate their cognate receptors (FGFR1-4) to stimulate cell proliferation and migration, and FGFR inhibition is effective in a variety of preclinical cancer models. Objectives: To test the novel pan-FGFR inhibitor ponatinib for efficacy in preclinical models of neuroblastoma. Design/Method: We treated a panel of established neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with increasing concentrations of Ponatinib and viability was determined using MTT assays. Additionally, neuroblastoma cell migration into a wound before and after treatment with ponatinib was monitored at 24 hour time intervals.

Epo level was undetectable, and In vitro testing revealed increased erythroid sensitivy with very rare Epo-independent erythroid growth. Search for JAK2 V617G and exon 12 somatic mutations were negative. A germline, heterozygous G6002A EPOR mutation was detected. Although this mutation had been previously reported among 16 other EpoR-mutations causing the dominantly inherited primary familial congenital polycythemia (PFCP), this mutation was found in no other family members. Given the development of moderate to severe headaches, phlebotomies were eventually initiated at the age of four to maintain a hematocrit <0.45. Over 14 yrs. of follow-up, he developed mild arterial hypertension, and hyperuricemia, but never had thrombotic complications under aspirin prophylaxis. Anti-hypertensive therapy was switched to enalapril at the age of 16 yrs. old. At the age of 17, in spite of well-controlled hematocrit level, anti-migraine agent zolimitriptan, a serotonin 5-HT receptor agonist was initiated due to worsening headaches. Phlebotomies were ceased for up to 24 weeks given stable hematocrit since the introduction of this medication. Bone marrow remained normal without evidence of marrow fibrosis. Conclusion: Although usually benign, inherited EpoR mutation may cause vascular complications such as hypertension. Given that serotonin has a known role in erythropoiesis, we propose that zolmitriptan alone, or in combination with angiotensin antagonist may be beneficial. Its effect should be evaluated in further studies. ",

Median age was 6years, and male: female ratio 20:11. Intent was palliative in 21patients (total 28courses); most were high risk NB and had received multiple courses of treatment, including Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in 3/21.

Previous research has reported that hyponatremia affects between 3.4-49% of hospitalized pediatric patients, but no studies have been done to evaluate the incidence of hyponatremia in pediatric oncology patients. In oncology the etiology of hyponatremia depends of many factors, illness, type of cancer, type of chemotherapy, type of hydration during chemotherapy. Objectives: To determine the incidence of hyponatremia in pediatric oncology patients by comparing those admitted for chemotherapy to those admitted for acute illness Design/Method: Retrospective cohort study involving chart review of all pediatric oncology admissions to the Children's Hospital of Illinois over an 18 month period. Results: During the study period, 74 eligible patients were admitted to receive chemotherapy and 63 due to acute illness. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to sex (p = 0.1385), and age (p = 0.9896). Most patients received fluids with 0.45% or 0.9% normal saline. A serum Na of < 135 was found in 15/74 (20%) patients admitted for chemotherapy and 27/63 (42%) of those admitted for acute illness (p = 0.0043). Even when accounting for differences in fluid type, hyponatremia was 3.1 times more likely to occur in patients admitted for acute illness in contrast to those admitted for scheduled chemotherapy (OR = 3.1 [1.4, 6 .7], p = 0.0044). In 45% patients had hyponatremia was present at the time of admission and 31% in the first 24 hours. None of the patients had symptomatic hyponatremia. There was no difference in the hospital length of stay (p = .00579) between the two groups Conclusion: Among the oncology patients those who present with acute illness are more likely to have or develop hyponatremia during their admission. Hyponatremia was subclinical and did not prolong the length of stay. We plan to compare the incidence of hyponatremia in patients receiving different regimens of chemotherapy and in patients with leukemia versus solid tumors.

The child had presented soon after birth with severe neonatal jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. In the blood smear red cells showed marked anisopoikilocytosis with dacryocytes, red cell fragments and macrocytes. In the bone marrow aspirate, erythroid cells showed prominent dyserythropoiesis, including megaloblastoid maturation, binucleation, nuclear contour irregularities and chromatin bridges; occasional multinucleated erythroids were present. Next-Generation sequence analysis of 29 genes associated with hemolytic and dyserythropoietic anemias was performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood. The patient was found to be compound heterozygous for two mutations in CDAN1 confirming the suspected diagnosis of CDA I. The first mutation, c.3051_3052delTG, is a previously unreported deletion that results in a frameshift. The second mutation, c.3071C>T (p.P1024L), is a missense variant that affects a highly conserved amino acid residue. Through the use of mutation prediction software, the amino acid substitution P1024L is predicted to be \"deleterious\" and \"probably damaging\". This variant is known as rs145041909 and was found in ExAC database, with very low MAF of 0.0001. Patient is currently managed with regular blood transfusions and iron chelation which has been effective, as monitored by MRI for liver iron, while the family is considering the option to try interferon-alpha therapy. Conclusion: CDA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of non-immune hemolytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. Next-Generation sequencing can provide a definitive diagnosis, may unveil new disease-causing mutations and may allow the consideration of other therapies like interferon-alfa that has been found to increase hemoglobin levels and decrease iron overload in patients with CDA I.",

To assess whether these proteins undergo nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation, cells were treated with Leptomycin B (LMB) to block nuclear export. Results: Examination of Mxi1 and Mxi0 subcellular location reveals that Mxi1 resides in the nucleus, while Mxi0 is found primarily in the cytoplasm. Exon 0 also displays cytoplasmic localization, indicating that the presence of Exon 0 contributes to differential localization. Treatment with LMB resulted in accumulation of Mxi0 in the nucleus, suggesting that Mxi0 cycles in and out of the nucleus in response to appropriate signals.

Design/Method: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed on pre-treatment tumor samples from three patients with MEGNT, as well as two additional post-radiation samples from one of these patients. Blood was available for germline WES in one case. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively by chart review. Results: All three patients underwent subtotal (Patients 1 and 2) or gross total (Patient 3) resection followed by involved field radiation therapy. Patients 1 and 3 had disease recurrence less than a year after treatment. Patient 2 has stable disease six months off therapy. Targeted clinical testing revealed Patient 1 to have both a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and a BRAF V600E mutation; WES identified an additional TSC1 frameshift mutation. RNA-seq analysis of patient 2 revealed an in-frame NTRK2-BEND5 fusion that is rarely found in pediatric high grade glioma. Patient 3 was found to have a BRAF V600E mutation by WES and RNA-seq revealed an in-frame SOS1-MAP4K3 fusion that has been previously reported in a case of thyroid cancer, but not CNS tumors. A post-XRT sample from this patient revealed TSC1 and TP53 mutations that were not seen in the primary tumor. Conclusion: Potentially targetable somatic alterations targeting the MAPK pathway were identified in all three cases of MEGNT, with TSC1 mutations indicating activation of mTOR signalling also found in two tumors. Molecular studies of larger series of MEGNTs are needed to confirm the primary role of these pathways in this rare tumor. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of agents (BRAF, MEK, NTRK, and mTOR inhibitors) targeting the genetic lesions identified in these patients are indicated.",

Design/Method: Different pediatric cancer cell lines were treated with varying concentrations of vorinostat or hydroxychloroquine, and cell viability was measured.

The combination treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability, with these two drugs cooperating in a dose-dependent manner. Hydroxychloroquine treatment resulted in profound conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicative of autophagy blockade, and this effect was greater in cells treated with both vorniostat and hydroxychloroquine alone. Finally, exposure to the combination of vorinostat and hydroxycholroquine resulted in decreased levels of phospho-ERK compared to single-agent treatment, signifying reduced cell proliferation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that when autophagy was inhibited by hydroxychloroquine in the presence of vorinostat, autophagosomes accumulated and cell viability/proliferation reduced. Conclusion: Our results show a clear and improved response when vorinostat is combined with hydroxychloroquine compared to vorinostat alone. We also observed an increase in autophagy inhibition as well as a decrease in cell proliferation in combination studies. Furthermore the IC50 concentration of vorinostat, about 200ng/ml, necessary for effect is well within the achievable clinical range of 150-500ng/ml. This combination of drugs has yet to be explored in pediatrics but has the potential to enhance the effect of an established chemotherapy agent with a well-known and easily accessible non-cancer drug.",

Standard of care currently includes local control (laser therapy), surgical approach (enucleation), radiation and chemotherapy as potential treatment options. Despite advances in chemotherapy administration, allowing pediatric oncologist to use intra-arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy in an attempt to avoid systemic chemotherapy side effects, recurrent cases continue to be challenging to treat while trying to preserve sight through avoiding enucleation. The use of plaque brachytherapy is not yet a well-established option in recurrent retinoblastoma. Objectives: Discuss the role of brachytherapy in relapsed retinoblastoma patients. Design/Method: Case report Results: A 15 month old male diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastoma group C disease in his right eye and group D in his left eye after presenting to his pediatrician with mild strabismus. He had an extensive treatment history due to continued disease recurrence. He has been followed closely with exams under anesthesia (EUAs) and local control with different laser therapies. He received five cycles of systemic chemotherapy (vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide), followed by intra-arterial chemotherapy (including: melphalan, carboplatin, topotecan and etoposide combinations) and then intravitreal chemotherapy (melphalan), and including left eye enucleation due continued disease recurrence. Despite all these measures a central macular tumor remained measuring 9cm x 12cm with a 4cm depth and choroidal invasion without seeding on the right eye. It was then decided to attempt plaque brachytherapy as salvage treatment. The plaque used was an EP2340N (Eye Physics 2340 Notched). It was a gold ophthalmic plaque with Iodine-125 seeds, 22mm in diameter containing 32 sources with varying activity from 0.53 millicuries to 3.17 millicuries delivering 45 Gy to depth of 7mm for treatment time of 48 hours. He tolerated brachytherapy well, with no significant immediate side effects and a continued excellent response with no evidence of active tumor 27 weeks after initial plaque placement. Conclusion: An excellent disease response can be seen with plaque brachytherapy, as seen in our case. The use of plaque brachytherapy should be considered a viable treatment option for retinoblastoma relapse cases.

Objectives: Characterize follow-up of patients with appendiceal carcinoid tumors. Design/Method: A retrospective chart review was performed at our institution of patients with a pathology diagnosis of appendiceal carcinoid from 2000-2015. Variables analyzed included demographics, tumor location, size, extent of invasion, surgical intervention, postoperative staging, surveillance, and tumor recurrence. Costs of follow-up, including financial, time, and family anxiety were noted. Results: Thirty patients were incidentally diagnosed with carcinoid tumor of the appendix after undergoing appendectomy as clinically indicated. Average age was 13.5\u00b12.8 years (range 8-18). Mean tumor size was 5.4\u00b14mm (range microscopic -15mm) with most occurring at appendiceal tip (n = 18, 60%). No node infiltration was found, though three patients had perineural and one patient had lymphovascular invasion. Six tumors (20%) had appendiceal perforation and five tumors had transmural invasion into mesoappendix. Nineteen (63%) patients were referred to oncology postoperatively for staging and surveillance examinations including ultrasonography (n = 11, 65%), MRI (n = 7, 41%) and CT (n = 6, 35%) scans. The majority (79%, n = 15) underwent serial 5-HIAA testing. Mean oncologic follow-up was 36\u00b134 months with 58% (n = 11) continuing surveillance. Two patients have ongoing follow-up 10 years after diagnosis, including referral to cancer survivor clinic. All surveillance testing was normal and no patients required further interventions. At least two patients traveled >4 hours for clinic visits and one patient commented on stressors related to the cancer diagnosis. Medical cost of follow-up including clinic visits, laboratory monitoring, and imaging ranged from $8,500 to $44,400 per patient. No patient without oncologic follow-up re-presented to surgery or oncology clinics. Conclusion: Appendectomy is an adequate treatment for pediatric appendiceal carcinoid <16mm despite presence of histologic risk factors.

Less commonly patients presented with a volvulus (N = 2) or a small bowel obstruction (N = 2). Four patients were febrile at presentation, two of which had documented bacterial infections. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology and when assessed, immunostaining was positive for D2-40, a marker for lymphatic endothelium. 15 patients underwent a gross total resection, 12 of which had partial bowel resection. Two patients had post-operative complications involving fever, feeding intolerance, and/or perforation. One patient underwent a biopsy alone followed by observation, has remained asymptomatic and has had stable growth of the malformation proportionate to size on imaging at 12 year follow-up. Length of follow-up for all patients ranged from 0-149 months with no recorded recurrences. Conclusion: Mesenteric lymphatic malformations in pediatrics are rare and patients commonly present with abdominal pain. Differential diagnosis includes abdominal solid tumors. Surgical resection has often been standard of care at our institution, however alternative management strategies, including medical therapy or sclerotherapy, warrant further investigation.",

Sixty-three percent of SLCT and gynandroblastoma (n = 46) were intermediately or poorly differentiated. Twenty-two percent (n = 16) of SLCT had heterologous elements, including 14% sarcomatous (n = 10) and 11% (n = 8) with a retiform pattern. Nineteen percent (n = 14) of patients had thyroid nodules and 8% (n = 6) had thyroid cancer. Four percent (n = 3) of patients developed metachronous ovarian stromal tumors, and 4% (n = 3) of patients had pleuropulmonary blastoma. In addition 14% (n = 10) reported other non DICER1-related tumors, 12% (n = 9) recurred and 4% (n = 3) died of progressive disease. Forty percent (n = 23) of the 57 patients tested had germline DICER1 mutations. Of patients with SLCT, 53% (20/38) of tested patients had germline DICER1 mutations as did 3 of 4 patients with gynandroblastoma. Preliminary analyses show 5 additional SLCTs with biallelic somatic DICER1 mutations. Compared to DICER1 germline negative patients, the prevalence of thyroid nodules (39% vs. 9%, p = 0.009) and thyroid cancer (26% vs. 0%, p = 0.003) was significantly higher among germline positive patients. Germline DICER1 mutations do not appear to impact outcome of the primary tumor, but are a risk factor for other tumors. The impact of biallelic somatic mutations in DICER1 is under investigation. Conclusion: Enrollment is ongoing. More than half of individuals with SLCT and 3 of 4 patients with gynandroblastoma had germline mutations in DICER1. Biallelic somatic DICER1 mutations were also found in SLCT. These findings warrant further investigation of germline and somatic DICER1 mutations and review of screening guidelines.",

The objective of the current study is to examine the role of this pathway in promoting chemoresistance in OS. Design/Method: We utilized immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, qPCR and immunofluorescence and bioinformatics tools and techniques to examine the role of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and its downstream effectors on OS cells and patient samples. Results: Using pathway analysis of gene expression datasets of human OS primary tumors, protein processing in the ER was found to be significantly enriched in OS tumors as compared to normal tissue. We confirmed the activation of ER stress pathways IRE-1, PERK and ATF6\u03b1in human OS cell lines and found that while all three pathways were differentially activated in the OS cell lines, only ATF6\u03b1 activation significantly enhanced chemoresistance to cisplatin, irinotecan and combinatorial treatment with cisplatin and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. This occurred via inhibition of Bax activation, suppression of RHEB-mTOR and inhibition of NOTCH signaling. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism of chemo-resistance in OS. Retrospective analysis of primary tumors from patients with OS showed that about 60% of these tumors expressed high levels of the ER stress induced transcription factor ATF6\u03b1 and its downstream pro-survival effectors such as BiP and PDI. This expression was associated with poor histological response and/ or poor survival in patients Conclusion: Our findings emphasize a previously uncharacterized role for ATF6\u03b1 as the nexus of a unique and versatile signaling network that regulates pathways that is crucial for the pathogenesis and therapy resistance of OS. Hence therapeutic targeting of the ATF6\u03b1 pathway holds promise as an innovative and effective treatment strategy for OS.",

Results: Case one is a girl admitted with multiple, diffuse hepatic hemangiomas that required liver transplantation. Histologic analysis of the resected liver revealed GLUT-1 positive HIH and islands of highly proliferative cellular atypia with malignant transformation. One year after the transplant, surveillance imaging detected pulmonary nodules. Two of the nodules were resected and histology revealed the same pathology. She completed six cycles of ifosfamide/doxorubicin and now remains in complete remission sixteen months after diagnosis.Case two is a boy admitted with a large hepatic mass, hypothyroidism and multiple pulmonary nodules. He underwent gross total resection and tumor pathology showed GLUT-1 positive HIH and islands of angiosarcoma. His disease progressed rapidly on sorafenib therapy. Therapy was changed to ifosfamide/doxorubicin, and after an initial partial response, his disease again progressed. He was subsequently switched to bevacizumab/gemcitabine/docetaxel, and despite good quality of life, he again experienced progressive disease. The newly formed metastatic hepatic nodules proved to be Glut-1 positive infantile hemangioma. He died fourteen months after diagnosis due to massive intratumoral hemorrhage. Conclusion: HIH may be a risk factor for developing angiosarcoma at a very young age. We recommend that hepatic Glut-1 positive hemangioma to be added to the potential cancer predisposition conditions. These patients should be monitored prospectively in vascular anomalies or cancer predisposition clinics, so that the incidence/true risk of developing angiosarcoma can be ascertained.

The mechanisms driving metastasis remain largely unknown, necessitating examinations into molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, novel targets and investigational therapies.

Our hypothesis is that upregulation of ITGB3 and its downstream signaling events perform important roles in metastasis of ES and may be a potential therapeutic target. Objectives: To investigate the role of ITGB3 and its downstream signaling pathways in driving establishment of metastasis in ES. Design/Method: We performed in vivo studies designed to gain insights into metastatic transcriptome and proteomic signatures for ES.

Our GEX and RPPA data also revealed two pathways of interest with statistically significant differences in both RNA and protein expression: KLF4 pathway and mTOR pathway. Derangements in both have been linked to multiple cancers, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone sarcomas. Conclusion: Our data suggest increased invasiveness as well as demonstrate statistically significant differences in both RNA and protein expression in pathophysiologically relevant pathways in radiation-treated bone sarcoma cells. We conclude that these findings warrant further investigation in both in vitro and in vivo models to elucidate mechanisms of radiotherapeutic resistance, and we are currently developing a Ewing sarcoma mouse model using our radiation-treated cell populations.

Novel approaches, such as expansion of gamma delta T cells, as opposed to alpha beta T cells, are being pursued. Gamma delta T cells are reasonable candidates for anti-neoplastic immunotherapy because they i) possess inherent anti-tumorigenicity, ii) require no priming, iii) direct tumor killing via recognition of stress-responsive ligands, and, as we show, iv) can be expanded in cGMP serum free media (SFM). Bioengineering of gamma delta T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can augment their anti-cancer effects. High-risk neuroblastoma is an appropriate choice for gamma delta T cell-based immunotherapy as na\u00efve gamma delta T cells are cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells and neuroblastoma cells express known target antigens. Objectives: Optimize expansion and transduction of anti-neuroblastoma gamma delta T cells. Design/Method: The effectiveness of gamma delta T cell expansion stimulated by IL-2 and bisphosphonates was evaluated in several SFMs. The expanded gamma delta T cells were evaluated for transduction efficiency using lentiviral vectors. Expanded na\u00efve and modified gamma delta T cells were assessed for cytoxicity toward neuroblastoma cells. Results: Of the SFM cultures, only one showed reliable expansion to clinically relevant numbers. OpTmizer media supplemented with high-dose IL-2 led to robust expansion as well as efficient transduction across multiple donors, comparable to that observed for alpha beta T cells with similar multiplicity of infection. Na\u00efve gamma delta T cells were cytotoxic toward a neuroblastoma cell line, which was enhanced by addition of an anti-GD2 CAR. Conclusion: An optimized method of gamma delta T cell expansion and transduction was developed that can be tested in early phase clinical trials. The absence of MHC-restriction affords the opportunity, with appropriate elimination of alpha beta T cells, for use in the allogeneic setting with limited risk of graft versus host disease, and the use of SFM provides a clinically safer and potentially more efficacious cellular immunotherapy. Gamma delta T cells display cytotoxicity toward neuroblastoma that increases with the addition of an anti-GD2 CAR.",

Despite real improvements in patient outcomes over the past decades, a diagnosis of metastatic osteosarcoma portends an exceptionally poor prognosis: the five-year survival rate of patients with metastases is less than 25% even with neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. PAR1, a G-protein coupled cell surface receptor, activates an intracellular signaling cascade when acted upon by thrombin, a secreted serine protease important in the coagulation cascade. PAR1 expression has been associated with increased osteosarcoma invasion and metastasis; we sought to determine the molecular mechanism by which this increase occurs. In endothelial cells, our laboratory observed that PAR1 stimulation caused activation of the inflammatory transcription factor family NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB activation is closely associated with the tissue invasion and extravasation steps of metastasis in osteosarcoma and other cancers. We hypothesized that an intracellular signaling complex, the CARMA3 / Bcl10 / MALT1 signalosome, may play a role in this signal transduction. Objectives: To identify the mechanism by which PAR1 activates NF-\u03baB in osteosarcoma and to determine whether this pathway is suitable for pharmacological inhibition. Design/Method: Activation of NF-\u03baB was examined using immunoblotting of phosphorylated Inhibitor of kappa-B (I\u03baB) and through the use of a luciferase reporter assay. NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription was evaluated by real-time PCR. To study osteosarcoma invasiveness in vitro, we used a transwell chamber (Boyden chamber) assay in which cells invaded through a matrigel layer. Results: We found that treatment of U2OS human osteosarcoma cells with either thrombin or with the PAR1-specific peptide agonist TRAP6 induced robust activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Specifically, we observed PAR1-dependent phosphorylation of I\u03baB, transcriptional activation of an NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter plasmid, and nuclear translocation of the RelA subunit of NF-\u03baB. Further, we discovered that siRNA-mediated knockdown of MALT1 completely abrogated PAR1-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in osteosarcoma cells. Additional gene expression profile array data detailing the metastatic reprogramming in PAR1-stimulated osteosarcoma cells will be presented. Conclusion: PAR1 stimulation caused NF-\u03baB activation in a MALT1-dependent fashion in osteosarcoma cells. MALT1 proteolytic activity inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy to combat osteosarcoma in the future. ",

It is typically slow growing and painless but can cause loosening and and displacement of teeth as well as anatomical distortion of teeth. The management of CGCG is conservative though a minority of patients may require more aggressive surgical management of the affected area. Denosumab, a RANK-L inhibitor, has been demonstrated to induce regression of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) though a distinct condition shares many similarities with CGCG. Objectives: To evaluate the off label use of denosumab in the management of CGCG. Design/Method: A 14-year-old male presented with an 8-year history of a large recurrent and progressive, non-tender mandibular biopsy proven CGCG. Although initially treated with numerous attempts at curettage, on subsequent progression, he also received intralesional steroids and calcitonin. With recurrence and ongoing progression, there was consideration of a more definitive surgical management consisting of partial mandibulectomy and reconstruction. To avoid a potentially morbid procedure, off label use of denosumab was initiated based on its current use in patients with GCTB. The patient received Denosumab 120mg SC every week for three weeks followed by Denosumab 120mg SC every month. Response to therapy was based on panoramic dental radiographs as well as physical exam. Results: Initial exam prior to start of denosumab showed an opaque, greyish, 2.5cm lesion of the anterior mandible that was nontender, nonmobile. Adjacent teeth were also loosened and mobile. Radiographs showed a radiolucent multiloculated anterior mandibular lesion. After four weeks of treatment with denosumab, the lesion showed regression on the lateral and medial aspects of the lesion with increased cortical stability. Radiograph showed calcification of the lesion. After 6 months of denosumab there is almost complete resolution of the lesion. There were no toxicities or adverse events from denosumab treatment. Conclusion: Although the underlying pathogenesis of CGCG is unclear, various studies implicate disregulation of odontoclasts, osteoclasts associated with resorption of deciduous teeth.

Only a subset of sarcomas harbor known recurrent genomic alterations or oncogenic gene fusions that are pathognomonic. Tumors that lack such recurrent alterations frequently represent a diagnostic challenge. Epigenetic modifications, such as global or specific changes in DNA methylation, are increasingly being recognized as a primary mechanism of oncogenesis in pediatric cancer. Genome-wide methylation profiling is emerging as a powerful tool to identify biologically and clinically relevant subgroups.",

Objectives: Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip Array (450K array) platform, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on a pilot/discovery cohort of pediatric sarcomas to identify their associated gene, promoter, and CpG island methylation signatures and explore key clinical and biological associations. Design/Method: We analyzed DNA from 61 pediatric sarcoma samples, including osteogenic sarcoma (n = 21), Ewing sarcoma (n = 15), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 10) and synovial sarcoma (n = 15). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to compare epigenetic signatures between and among disease subtypes. Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and synovial sarcoma tumours have distinct DNA methylation profiles whose distribution is associated with known histological subtypes. Although the DNA methylation profiles of rhabdomyosarcomas do not cluster distinctly, they tend to be grouped with either osteogenic or synovial sarcomas. Conclusion: We were able to identify epigenetic signatures that are distinctly associated with known histologic subtypes of pediatric sarcoma. These results suggest that DNA methylation profiling has diagnostic utility in these tumours. An exploratory analysis investigating the clinical and prognostic significance of the genetic/epigenetic changes is currently ongoing.",

            "text": "Background: Ependymoma (EPN) is the third most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Current standard treatment is maximally safe surgical resection followed by radiation therapy. Chemotherapies have not been proven to increase survival outcomes (5-year Event Free Survival 40-85%). Prognosis is even more dismal in those with recurrent EPN which occurs in nearly half of the patients, and there are no known curative options. Therefore, it is imperative to learn more about the biology of recurrent diseases and identify the cellular driver of EPN recurrence, as well as understanding the mechanisms of therapy resistance. We hypothesize that ependymoma recurrence is driven by a subpopulation of therapy-resistant tumors cells with enhanced tumorigenicity in SCID mice. Objectives: To study the tumorigenicity of recurrent pediatric ependymomas at the different clinical stages, whether at diagnosis, first recurrence, second recurrence, or beyond. Design/Method: Over the last 10 years, we have collected a total of 77 pediatric ependymoma patient tumor samples from across the country. Of those, we identified 9 patients with recurrent ependymomas in which we have collected tumor samples from each recurrence (n = 9 sets). The median age of these patients is 6 years old (ranges from 2 -10 years). The median time to first recurrence is 35 months (ranges from 9 -61 months). Each set has from 1 to 5 recurrences. To study the tumorigenicity of these brain tumors at the different clinical stages, we directly implanted tumor cells (1\u00d7105 cells/mouse) from all 9 patients into the matched locations in the brains of SCID mice (e.g., human cerebral tumors to mouse cerebrum, human cerebellar tumors to mouse cerebellum) and monitored for tumor formation. Results: In 3 of the 9 sets, tumor formation was confirmed in mouse brains from the latest recurrent patient tumor, while samples from the same patient from earlier stages either did not form tumors in mouse brains or are currently pending. Tumor formation in the remaining models are still pending. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings demonstrate progressive enhancement of tumorigenicity during ependymoma recurrence. This has become a very unique and extremely valuable platform to study brain tumor recurrence. Results: Seven patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 10 years, ranging between 5 and 15 years. The local recurrence rate was 0%. The consolidation time varied between 3 and 6 months, occurring on average 4.5 months after surgery. The limb function after consolidation was classified between good and excellent. They recorded three deaths, unrelated to the applied technique. Conclusion: This technique offers an alternative biological reconstruction, with the added benefits of allowing perfect bone fitting, easy adjustment to ligaments and tendons, not depend on bone bank or foreign material, provide more rapid consolidation, and have lower cost and greater graft longevity.",

There are currently no standard treatments for these patients. Docetaxol (Taxotere, T), Bevacizumab (Avastin, A), and Gemcitabine (Gemzar, G) have activity in sarcomas. One study of 3 children using \"TAG\" yielded a partial response in 2 patients, and stable disease in one (JPHO 2012 34:524-7). Objectives: We report our preliminary experience with this novel combination for 22 high-risk sarcoma AYA patients. Background: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Molecular profiling recently enabled the classification of MB into four distinct subgroups, of which group 3 patients have the worst prognosis. Objectives: We aimed to discover and validate targetable lesions in MB using a high-throughput functional screen. Design/Method: We performed kinase inhibitor screening on group 3-like MB cell lines D341, D425 and CHLA-01-Med. Comparing the sensitivities of the individual cell lines to each other, >400 primary leukemia samples and >100 established human cancer cell lines we identified recurring \"hits\" within pathways that were specific to particular lines. We then used targeted western blotting to evaluate the biochemical correlates of these pathways. In vivo efficacy was assessed using a murine model and clinically available inhibitors. Lastly, primary patient cells were expanded in an intracranial murine model then plated on our functional screen, the results interpreted as with the cell line data. Results: Kinase screening revealed clustering of sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, IGFR inhibitors and aurora kinase inhibitors in D341, D425 and CHLA-01-Med cells, respectively. Western blotting corroborated that these pathways were hyperactivated in the cell line of interest. Uniquely, exome sequencing of D341 revealed a novel somatic variant (A415V) with unknown functional significance in the tumor suppressor gene, TSC2. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 A415V mutation demonstrated diminished TSC1-interaction and protein destabilization in a heterologous expression system. In vivo studies showed targeted tumor suppression when using an FDA-approved mTOR inhibitor against D341 cells with minimal suppression of CHLA-01-Med cells, confirming that the screening reveals specific targetable pathways. Perhaps most importantly, we successfully obtained inhibitor data on a primary patient tumor, which is an important proof-of-concept that this tool can provide reliable information on primary samples in less than 72 hours. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings indicate that a subset of high-risk MB patients may have functionally relevant hyperactivation of targetable pathways, some of which may not have been found on traditional exome sequencing. This functional screen may offer an additional tool to inform adjunct treatment decisions in this complex and heterogeneous disease.",

Survival has remained stagnant for the past 20 years and new therapeutic combinations are desperately needed. Previous studies using IL-11R\u03b1 CAR T-cells have shown benefit for the treatment of OS. However, IL-11R\u03b1 CAR T-cell therapy alone did not completely eradicate the tumor. Up-regulation of the immune checkpoint pathway programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) in tumor cells have shown to limit immunotherapeutic efficacy. Anti-PD-1 blockade has shown survival and prognostic benefit in various tumors. Objectives: To investigate a combination approach using IL-11R\u03b1 CAR T-cells and an anti-PD-1 antibody to treat OS cells. Similarly, it was noted in a MYC induced lymphoma model that shRNAs directed against ATG5, an essential autophagy gene, augmented cell death following p53 activation (Amravadi et al 2007) . Based on the current literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesized that MYC driven medulloblastoma have high autophagy, which is the key mechanism of therapeutic resistance and cell survival. Objectives: Primary objective is to establish that increased MYC expression induces higher levels of autophagy in medulloblastoma cells, and that chemical inhibitors of autophagy can augment the effect of cytotoxic drugs used in treatment of medulloblastoma. Design/Method: The experimental model used to test this hypothesis were DAOY cells which are medulloblastoma cells derived from pediatric patient tumor with no known MYC amplification. Oncogenic MYC was introduced using a lentiviral construct (DAOY-MYC) and empty expression vector (DAOY-CTR) as the control in order to generate these isogenic cell lines. The primary assays utilized to assess autophagy and autophagic flux used the detection of LC3B and p62 protein levels by immunoblotting with and without lysomotrophic agents. Results: DAOY-MYC cells have consistently demonstrated higher basal autophagy compared to DAOY-CTR \u00ac as demonstrated by detection of higher LC3B proteins when not treated with lysomotrophic agent. One-hour treatment with HCQ demonstrates similar flux in both the cell lines, indicating the presence of functional autophagy. Furthermore, this phenotype was lost in when MYC was inhibited using RNAi in DAOY-MYC cells. Moreover, p62 protein expression was diminished in DAOY-MYC cells. Conclusion: Introducing MYC into medulloblastoma cells increases autophagy under basal growth conditions. This phenotype where autophagy is increased has been noted in our lab in other cell lines driven by KRAS oncogene, highlighting a shared resistance mechanism by these two distinct oncogenes.",

Apart from a single report of diagnostic delays in children with low-grade gliomas, no additional reports have evaluated this delay in the United States since the late 1980s. Objectives: To establish an accurate Ohio baseline from symptom onset to definitive diagnosis in children with newly-diagnosed CNS tumors. Design/Method: The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for over 300 children with newly-diagnosed CNS tumors from January 2004 to August 2015 at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

Objectives: Describe the case of a patient with a recurrent choroid plexus carcinoma, with no evidence of disease after undergoing treatment for abscesses in the resection cavity. Design/Method: Case Report Results: A 3-year-old girl was diagnosed with a right parietal choroid plexus carcinoma after presenting with progressively unsteady gait. Family history was notable for breast cancer in her mother. Subsequent genetic workup was positive for the TP53 mutation, and Li Fraumeni syndrome was diagnosed. She underwent a near total resection of the tumor, followed by 6 cycles of chemotherapy of etoposide, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide. Three months after completion of treatment, she was noted to have a large recurrence in the surgical cavity. After a repeat resection, she underwent radiation therapy. Her first brain MRI after radiation therapy showed an enhancing nodule; upon resection, this was found to be recurrent/residual tumor. She started on chemotherapy with temozolomide, irinotecan and bevacizumab. Ten days after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed subgaleal, epidural, and intraparenchymal abscesses along the surgical tract. Operative wound cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and treatment with antibiotics was initiated. Her course was complicated by recurrent wound dehiscence and unsuccessful primary closure despite multiple attempts. Due to deteriorating quality of life in the face of tumor recurrence, her parents chose to pursue palliative care, with continuation of oral antibiotic prophylaxis. After 3 months, repeat MRI of the brain showed persistence of the right parietal lobe abscess and peripheral enhancement around the surgical cavity more suggestive for an inflammatory reaction, rather than tumor. She was restarted on IV antibiotics for palliative purposes, and repeat MRI of the brain after 3 further months of antibiotic therapy showed a resolution of the abscess and no evidence of tumor. Conclusion: This case raises interesting questions regarding the role of immunomodulation in cancer therapy, given that following the development of an inflammatory response to bacterial intracranial abscess, a tumor previously resistant to numerous resections, chemotherapeutic agents, and cranial irradiation has apparently resolved.",

MRI of the brain identified a left parietal dural based mass. Surgical resection of the mass was performed and pathology showed a proliferation of histiocytes with nuclear atypia consistent with HS. The patient received proton beam radiation therapy and then started ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) based therapy which is ongoing, with evaluation after the third cycle. Conclusion: Currently there is no standard therapy for HS. Treatment strategies include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation. Complete surgical resection when feasible should be considered since it may provide a better prognosis.

No patients with gross total resection had progression of disease. Those with progression eventually received radiation therapy, all after age 5 years, with no further progression. All patients were living with no disease or stable imaging findings at the time of our review. Endocrinopathy was present in all non-cerebellar tumors, but neurological deficits were rare and typically involved visual defects. Conclusion: Gross total resection for cerebellar PMA prevented tumor recurrence in our cohort and was similar to findings for PA. Hypothalamic and chiasmatic lesion tumors were less apt to be completed resected and hence require different management. The hypothalamic and chiasmatic tumors also experience different late effects based on location and treatments. Our patients are all alive and hence have not revealed a poorer prognosis compared to PA although it will be important to observe these patients for a longer period of time to definitively establish progression-free survival and late effects in PMA patients compared to more mature PA patient series.",

Design/Method: With parental consent, background clinical information, history of presenting illness, results of relevant laboratory investigations, and intended course of management are reviewed. Results: Cordocentesis done on a 34-year-old woman at 30+4 weeks gestational age (GA) to investigate fetal hepatomegaly showed a hemoglobin of 70 g/L, leukocytosis (166\u00d710\u02c69/L) and thrombocytopenia (24\u00d710\u02c69/L). Further investigations, including morphologic examination and flow cytometry, confirmed the diagnosis of AML, monocytic type, in the fetus. Subsequent cytogenetic analysis showed mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) aneuploidy, but no MLL gene disruption. An exchange transfusion via cordocentesis was planned to extend gestation and optimize neonatal outcome, but the mother developed mirror syndrome, and at 30+6 weeks GA underwent an urgent caesarean section. A live female infant was born with edema, distended abdomen, petechiae, ecchymoses and no spontaneous respiratory effort. Labwork showed a hemoglobin of 66 g/L, white blood cell count of 218\u00d710\u02c69/L, platelets of 111\u00d710\u02c69/L, and abnormal coagulation profile. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and at two hours of life, parents chose to palliate their child. Autopsy demonstrated disseminated leukemia involving central nervous system, liver, bone marrow, and placenta. Conclusion: It is possible to diagnose hematologic malignancy in a fetus, but even in neonates there is little information to direct management. We intended to begin with exchange transfusion via cordocentesis to reduce leukocytosis and thereby prolong gestation. Then, once stable after delivery, to use low dose chemotherapy until the infant was term and thought to be able to tolerate full treatment. Unfortunately the mother and infant were not well enough to pursue this course. Fetal leukemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a fetus presenting with hepatomegaly. As similar cases are identified, clinicians should share their experience to provide future guidance in management.",

Signaling abnormalities in the beta-catenin pathway are associated with 90% of these tumors. In fact beta-catenin-YAP (Yes-associated protein) co-activation was observed in 80% of hepatoblastoma patients. Overexpression of YAP and beta-catenin in mice led to hepatoblastoma development. A gene array analysis of mRNA isolated from the tumor bearing livers revealed 5 genes that showed significant upregulation in the tumors and also had binding sites in their promoters of transcription factors TCF4 (which binds beta-catenin) and TEAD (which binds YAP). One of these genes was lipocalin 2, a small molecule protein with known antibacterial properties that has been found to be expressed in a variety of adult cancers. Objectives: To determine if lipocalin 2 is expressed in human hepatoblastoma. Design/Method: We used a tissue microarray of 74 patient hepatoblastoma samples from a tertiary care Pediatric Hospital to evaluate the presence of lipocalin 2 by immunohistochemistry. The tumors were classified by histology type and the degree of lipocalin 2 staining was graded on a 0-3 scale. Staining was further stratified as either nuclear, cytoplasmic, or both. Next, cell lysates from HepG2 cell culture (a human heptoblastoma cell line) were tested for the presence of lipocalin 2 using western blot analysis. Results: Lipocalin 2, which is normally not expressed in hepatocytes, was found to be present in either the nucleus or cytoplasm of 70 (95%) of the pediatric hepatoblastoma samples. The degree of staining for lipocalin 2 varied within each sample based on tumor histology. All embryonal components were strongly positive for lipocalin 2 with staining scores of 2-3. Ninety-six percent of crowded fetal histology components had positive lipocalin 2 staining, although the staining ranged from 1-2 in intensity. There was minimal to no expression of lipocalin 2 in blastema and small cell undifferentiated components.

Fundoscopic examination revealed bilateral optic disc edema with peripapillary hemorrhages, scattered retinal hemorrhages centrally, large areas of retinal whitening, and cotton wool spots. Differential diagnosis based on ophthalmologic examination included leukemic versus infectious retinopathy. MRI Brain/Orbit was negative for intracranial pathology, orbital masses, or optic nerve edema. Total white blood cell count was 1000 cells/\u03bcl with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 400 cells/\u03bcl, and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 100 cells/\u03bcl. Vitreous aspiration was performed with intravitreal injection of amphotericin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, clindamycin, and ganciclovir. Vitreous fluid was positive for CMV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CMV DNA was also detected in serum by quantitative PCR. Vitreous cells were negative for malignancy by flow cytometry. Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid were also negative for malignancy. Therefore the diagnosis of CMV retinitis was made. He was treated with a three-week course of valganciclovir followed by prophylactic dosing. Visual acuity is stable with improvement in retinitis by fundoscopic exam but he remains with visual field deficits. Conclusion: CMV retinitis has rarely been reported as a complication of ALL therapy without transplant but occurrence of CMV-reactivation should be recognized, especially in patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies.

The association between obesity and cancer has been widely studied, showing that obese patients are at risk for multiple side effects and poor outcome. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in pediatric patients in the US. There is no known effective treatment of NAFLD except diet and exercise. L-carnitine has been used in prior studies to treat chemotherapy-induced liver toxicity but has not been used in pediatric oncology patients with fatty liver. We have identified a high-risk group of pediatric oncology patients at risk for developing fatty liver and its complications. Objectives: Describe a pediatric patient with relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and fatty liver disease treated with L-carnitine. Design/Method: Review of medical record. Results: An obese thirteen year-old boy with relapsed T-ALL was found to have persistent elevations of liver enzymes (AST and ALT peaking at 2.5x and 10x normal respectively), despite breaks in chemotherapeutic regimen. Imaging performed showed changes consistent with fatty liver. Due to the risk of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), bone marrow transplant (BMT) was held. To maintain his remission, he was given further chemotherapy and additionally started on L-carnitine 1 gram orally twice a day in an attempt to lower his liver enzymes. After three months of treatment, both AST and ALT gradually improved to near normal levels and BMT with a haplo-identical donor was pursued. Transplant regimen was overall well tolerated, without evidence of SOS. The patient continues to be in remission and continues on L-carnitine with no side effects from L-carnitine observed. Conclusion: In this patient, L-carnitine was thought to improve the transaminitis, which enabled him to undergo BMT. Transaminitis due to fatty liver can be a significant factor leading to alterations or interruptions in chemotherapy regimens, increase transplant morbidity and thus affect overall survival and increase risk of relapse. L-carnitine supplementation along with a diet and exercise regimen may be able to improve transaminitis and reverse fatty liver. Overall, it is well-tolerated without significant toxicities. Further prospective studies are needed.",

Nasal endoscopy revealed pale and insensate mucosa, and imaging showed diffuse, nodular ground glass opacities throughout the lungs. Nasal biopsy revealed branching hyphe with septations, suggestive of Aspergillus. Voriconazole and micafungin were started empirically. On day 4 of culture, the fungus showed zygospores with a prominent beak and sporangiola characteristic of Conidiobolus species. The organism was resistant to all antifungal agents except terbinafine (amphotericin B and anidulafungin intermediate). Treatment was changed to liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), anidulafungin, and terbinafine. Bone marrow aspirate was negative for leukemia at day 17 of induction. Due to progressive pulmonary and sinus disease extending to the skull base, chemotherapy was temporarily halted and neutrophil support was augmented with daily GM-CSF, granulocyte infusions and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Granulocyte infusions were discontinued following endogenous neutrophil recovery 30 days after ALL diagnosis, while LAmB, GM-CSF and HBOT continued for several more weeks. Imaging dramatically improved, and sinus fungal cultures became negative.

Objectives: Objective: We present an infant with WS and bone marrow (BM) failure, found to have autosomal recessive (AR) infantile malignant osteopetrosis (OP). Design/Method: Design/Method: Case ReportA full term infant was found to have a murmur early in life. An echocardiogram showed supravalvular aortic and pulmonic stenosis, raising concerns for WS. Genetic testing confirmed this at 2 months of age, finding a characteristic 7q deletion. Soon after, she was evaluated for dehdyration and found to be anemic and thrombocytopenic. A BM biopsy demonstrated fibrosis, and she required periodic transfusions. Further work-up for BM failure syndromes, including Fanconi Anemia and Dyskeratosis Congenita, was negative, but imaging showed bony changes concerning for OP. A repeat BM biopsy showed increased osteoclasts, and genetic testing demonstrated pathogenicTCIRG1 mutations (c.304delG and c.1887+1G>A) consistent with infantile malignant OP, AR type 1. The patient then underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Results: Results: WS is a constellation of signs and symptoms caused by a deletion in chromosome 7. The American Academy of Pediatrics has established clinical guidelines for the care of patients with WS, including necessary surveillance, but hematologic issues are rarely associated with this syndrome, and not a part of these guidelines.OP can manifest at various ages depending on its mode of inheritance. The AR form, infantile malignant OP, presents early in life and is caused by mutations in TCIRG1, CLCN7, OSTM1, RANK and RANKL. It manifests as hypocalcemia, sclerotic bones, frequent fractures, and sometimes visual loss, hearing loss, and BM failure due to expansion of bone. HSCT can halt or slow disease progression by replacing defective osteoclasts. WS and OP have not been previously described together, although some WS mouse models have shown osteopetrosis-like features without the osteoclast dysfunction or deficiency seen in OP. Conclusion: Conclusion: While WS and OP have been well characterized, this is the first documented case of both diagnoses in the same patient. Further research into potential genetic associations between these two diseases may elucidate the pathophysiology of both further.",

            "text": "Background: Primary pleural synovial sarcoma (PPSS) is an extremely rare tumor. It was first described in 1996 as a case series of 5 patients, 3 of whom were children < 18 years. We report the first case of PPSS in association with paraspinal ganglioneuroma and serous cystadenoma of ovary with a mutation in MET oncogene of unknown significance. Occurrence of multiple different tumors in a young patient with a genetic mutation suggests a possibility of a hitherto unknown cancer predisposition syndrome. Objectives: Report a rare presentation of PPSS in association with paraspinal ganglioneuroma and serous cystadenoma of ovary. Design/Method: Case report Results: A 16-year-old, Caucasian female presented with 3 weeks of right chest pain in August 2013. Family history was significant for multiple solid tumors (laryngeal, thyroid, colon and renal). MRI chest showed a right pleural mass. Biopsy of resected mass was suggestive of monophasic synovial sarcoma with positive margin. Immunohistochemistry was positive for Vimentin, EMA and CK7. Cytogenetics revealed t(X;18)(p11.2-q11.2)(SYT-SSX). Metastatic workup revealed a left lumbar paraspinal lesion and right adnexal mass. Biopsy of the left paraspinal lesion revealed mature ganglioneuroma. Biopsy of resected adnexal mass was consistent with a diagnosis of serous cystadenoma of ovary. The genetic work up revealed constitutional heterozygous mutation in MET proto-oncogene-p.D208G(c.823A>G).The patient was staged as IRS GradeIII, StageIII, POG Grade III. She received 6 cycles of Ifosfamide + Doxorubicin (COG Protocol ARST0332) and 55.8 Gy of radiation. Currently, patient remains in remission. Conclusion: PPSS has never been reported in association with other tumors. Cell of origin for PPSS still remains an enigma. Based on recent demonstration of immunophenotypic overlap between SS and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (Folpe et al) besides constitutive expression of SS associated fusion genes (SYT-SSX) in neuroepithelial tissue (Brujin et al) and a genetic mutation of unknown significance in our patient, we hypothesize that the constellation of tumors in our patients may not be merely coincidental. These tumors may be arising from a common pleuripotent mesenchymal stem cell. We will verify this hypothesis by further immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analysis of ganglioneuroma and cystadenoma.",

IST and Bone marrow transplant are the first line treatment options. About 30 % of AA children will not respond to primary IST and will require second-line therapy, 15-30% of those who respond will relapse. Clonal evolution of hematopoiesis and PNH is thought to occur in about 10-15% of AA patients, with the clonal abnormality frequently detected at diagnosis. Clonal hematopoiesis and PNH may also develop years after IST treatment. These patients require a long-term follow up by a specialized care center knowledgeable in late manifestations of disease. A 9 year old Indian male who presented with symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus was found to have a large posterior fossa mass with a 'drop lesion' in the thoracic spine at T1 level. He had a near total resection and the pathology showed WHO grade IV medulloblastoma. He received radiation and chemotherapy with lomustine, vincristine and cisplatin. While on treatment, the patient developed an external mass over the surgical scar with associated posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Further imaging showed a new lesion in the subcutaneous plane infiltrating the erector spinae muscles with loco-regional lymph node metastasis. There was no simultaneous recurrence in the primary tumour bed and no other metastasis. Biopsy of this lesion confirmed subcutaneous recurrence of medulloblastoma. Aggressive surgical resection combined with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue was suggested as a curative option by the treating team but the family opted for a palliative approach with metronomic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide and etoposide. He had rapid disease progression with worsening lymphadenopathy resulting in internal jugular vein compression and facial edema as well as right facial nerve palsy. Metronomic chemotherapy was withdrawn and patient ultimately succumbed to the disease five months after the recurrence was noted.",

Reportedly shown to safely shunt metabolism of 6-MP away from the hepatoxic/myelotoxic 6-MMP metabolite and toward the more favorable/efficacious metabolite 6-TGN metabolite, the synergistic potential of allopurinol is now being employed by some cancer centers. Despite recent evidence to support the potential efficacious nature of this drug combination, users must remain cautious for possible myelotoxic and even life-threatening effects.

He was receiving combination mercaptopurine (50mg daily) and allopurinol therapy (100mg daily). Combination therapy was initiated 1-month previously due to unfavorable 6-MP metabolite profile while on mercaptopurine monotherapy (100mg daily) (6-MMP 16,157pmol/8\u00d7108RBCs (risk of toxicity when >5,700), 6-TGN 186pmol/8\u00d7108RBCs (most therapeutic when >230<400)). This metabolite profile was associated with mild pancytopenia, (WBC-2600/MM3, ANC-1100/MM3, Hgb-11.7g/dL, PLT-143K/MM3). The addition of allopurinol, even with a concurrent 50% dose reduction of mercaptopurine, resulted in significant elevations in both 6-MP metabolites, (6-MMP 26,874pmol/8\u00d7108RBCs, 6-TGN 463pmol/8\u00d7108RBCs).

Common AEs related to Cabozantinib include palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and nausea. In the adult patient population, these are often dose limiting, however both patients tolerated it well overall. One has had mild nausea requiring no dose adjustment; the other exhibited erythrodysesthesia that required a dose reduction with resolution of the AE.

He had frequent episodes of febrile illnesses with worsened pancytopenia that responded to oral steroids. A gradual rise of IgM and positive family history of hyper IgM syndrome (his mother) led to immune workup, although he has maintained age-appropriate immunoglobulin levels and lacked clinical evidence of deep seated sinopulmonary infections. Eventually, his mother was diagnosed with PI3KCD mutations (P110\u03b4 E1021K) which lead us to test him for the same (result pending). Although he never exhibited low IgG or IgA prior to starting supplemental IVIG, enumeration of T/B cell subsets revealed decreased numbers of regulatory T cells and isotype switched memory B cells (not absent) along with inverted ratio of na\u00efve vs. memory T cells (1:2), persistent lymphopenia, and compensatory increase in NK cell numbers. It is unclear how maternal PI3KCD mutation affected his clinical features. The patient has been clinically stable with sirolimus and supplemental IVIG. Conclusion: PI3KCD mutation can be manifested as predominant hematological abnormalities without hypogammaglobulinemia, but enumeration of T/B cell subsets may be informative before proceeding to gene mutation analysis.

Initial labs were significant for a platelet count of 8 K/uL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 seconds with international normalized ratio 1.3, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 87 seconds. The aPTT 1:1 mixing study demonstrated an inhibitor but the PT 1:1 mixing study revealed a factor deficiency, later found to be lupus anticoagulant and low Factor II activity, respectively. Other autoimmune workup revealed triple antiphospholipid antibody positivity (APA), positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies as well as low complement component 3 and 4 and positive direct antiglobulin test. Given the presence of the lupus anticoagulant as well as low Factor II activity, he was diagnosed with LAHPS. Initial therapy included intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (1 gm/kg) and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg oral daily. The peak platelet response after IVIg was 49K/uL. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed trilineage hematopoiesis and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, normal cytogenetics, and negative myelodysplastic syndrome panel by FISH. After the third dose of IVIg, his platelet count remains above 50k/uL and all clinical signs of bleeding have resolved. Conclusion: LAHPS is a rare phenomenon in children with predominant hematologic concern of thrombosis. A small percentage of patients can have bleeding complications typically due to thrombocytopenia. Due to these contrasting but very serious risks, patients need to be monitored closely by hematologists. Future assessments include serial monitoring of blood counts, renal function, APA, ANA, and dsDNA antibodies. Future therapies considered for LAHPS are typically chosen based on clinical symptoms and include corticosteroids and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy as well as thrombopoietin mimetics for worsening thrombocytopenia.

Y90 radio-embolization is an emerging therapy for liver tumors. Currently, there are no reports of either modality being used for local control of pediatric UESL. Objectives: We report the case of a 17yo female with an extensive UESL with diaphragmatic invasion. After a poor response to two cycles of neoadjuvant ifosfamide and doxorubicin, two cycles of gemcitabine and taxotere were administered. While the tumor showed a moderate volumetric response, the patient experienced gemcitabine-related neurotoxicity, the tumor remained unresectable and severe tumor-related pain persisted. Therefore, Y90 radio-embolization was performed on the largest portion of the tumor followed by TACE with doxo-eluting beads to the diaphragmatic portion of the tumor via the phrenic artery. Design/Method: This case is being reported due to the unique approach to the local control of this UESL. Y90 beads were chosen over TACE for the large inferior portion of the tumor from studies in HCC showing equivalent outcomes, but less pain with radio-embolization.

PAP was treated with whole lung lavages and ECMO with resolution of symptoms in patient one, however treatment options for PAP were limited for patient two due to underlying LPI. HLH and PAP have been described independently in patients with LPI. Our second patient unifies the picture of an inborn aminoaciduria leading to macrophage dysfunction and immune dysregulation causing HLH and PAP.

Design/Method: We conducted a search of PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar search using the terms \"Sotos Syndrome\" and \"Hodgkin\" and \"lymphoma.\" There were 11 previously reported cases of hematologic malignancies in association with Sotos Syndrome, but none of HL. Of note, these studies indicated that males are affected much often than females. Our case increases the number of reports to 12.",

Our search yielded 17 manuscripts. The patient was successfully treated with 3 cycles of doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and cyclophosphamide and has remained in remission now for 33 months. Conclusion: Sotos Syndrome is a rare genetic disease that appears to have an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma. Our case is the 12th such case and the first HL. We hope that this will increase awareness of the possible association of SS and HL and Background: Thymic carcinomas (TC) are rare in adults and less common in children, accounting for less than 1% of childhood mediastinal tumors. In adults, the first treatment is usually surgical resection. Approximately 30% of TC are metastatic at diagnosis and are unresectable. The medial survival with current platinum-based chemotherapy regimens is approximately 2 years. There are ongoing studies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for advanced thymic tumors, but no reports of their use in maintenance therapy in metastatic TC in children.",

Design/Method: A 13 year old male with autism, who presented with a mediastinal mass, was diagnosed with stage IV TC. The tumor was unresectable and there were multiple metastatic lung lesions. The patient was treated with cisplatin 75mg/m2 and docetaxel 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks. To prevent regrowth, we initiated maintenance therapy with sunitinib, a drug reported to stabilize disease in adults with advanced thymic malignancies. Results: After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, imaging revealed reduction of the anterior mediastinal mass (36% reduction) and decreased pulmonary metastases. Following 8 cycles of chemotherapy, repeat imaging showed further decrease in size (76% reduction) and number of pulmonary metastases. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, he was started on sunitinib 25mg oral daily. Side effects included discoloration of skin surrounding his g-tube which was used for administration and a faint, erythematous rash on his chest. Since starting sunitinib, the patient continues to have reduction in the primary tumor size. Most recent chest CT performed 22 months after initiation of sunitinib showed an 88% reduction from the original mass and further resolution of lungs metastases. Conclusion: Thymic malignancies are rare tumors that are aggressive and difficult to treat in advanced stages. We demonstrate disease response using sunitinib, a multi-TKI, as maintenance therapy to prevent regrowth. While on sunitinib, the patient continues to have disease reduction with minimal side effects. Given the rarity of these tumors, this is a promising therapeutic approach for an advanced-stage tumor in a pediatric patient.",

Up to 30% of A-T patients will develop cancer, mostly of lymphoid origin. These patients pose a unique challenge due to their sensitivity to radiation and increased risk of chemotherapy complications such as hemorrhagic cystitis and severe infection. Objectives: We discuss a 12-year-old female with A-T who presented with two weeks of neck swelling. Excisional biopsy revealed mature B-cell lymphoma. Staging PET/CT scan showed localized disease. Design/Method: The patient's treatment was based on the successful treatment of elderly patients with high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma with 6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) combined with rituximab (375 mg/m2), which resulted in complete response (CR) rate of 85% which was modified therapy to limit toxicity. She received one cycle of COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) with near CR on MRI. For her first cycle of R-CHOP, cyclophosphamide dose was reduced and she remained hospitalized for count nadir and recovery due to risk of infection.

Results: Following four cycles of R-CHOP, MRI showed CR. Following her fifth cycle she was admitted with fever, neutropenia, and hypotension requiring vasopressor support. Echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 22% following a cumulative anthracycline dose of 250 mg/m2. She was intubated, and developed worsened hypotension and desaturation, progressing to cardiac arrest. Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation, spontaneous cardiac function did not return, and patient died. Signs of heart failure were evident on limited autopsy of chest, however underlying etiology remained unclear. Conclusion: Despite superior treatments for many non-Hodgkin lymphomas, patients with A-T continue to present obstacles due to their exquisite sensitivity to commonly employed anti-cancer therapies. R-CHOP may be an acceptable regimen for these patients, but may still be too toxic. Increased risk for cardiac toxicity has not been reported, and may be another sensitivity in A-T patients. Additional studies are warranted to further understand this special patient population, leading to adaptation of treatments or improved protection from toxicities. Background: Ulcerated primary melanoma is associated with a poor prognosis. Studies show that ulcerated melanoma treated with adjuvant pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2b) has improved recurrence-free survival in adults with cutaneous melanoma. Objectives: To report our experience using pegylated interferon alfa-2b in a pediatric patient with ulcerated stage IIIB Melanoma. Design/Method: Case report Results: An 8-year-old girl presented with a right lower extremity lesion with pathology revealing a malignant melanoma with spitzoid features invasive to at least Clark level IV, Breslow depth of at least 1.4 mm with a microscopic focus of ulceration, and a mitotic rate of 3/mm2. A PET scan showed increased uptake in a right inguinal lymph node with no distant metastasis. She underwent a wide local excision with full-thickness skin grafting and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Pathology was negative for residual disease with a 1.5 cm margin. One lymph node was focally involved by metastatic melanoma (0.7 mm). A radical inguinal lymph node dissection was performed and negative for disease.Given the presence of high-risk disease with ulceration, she was started on PEG-IFN-\u03b1-2b induction therapy for 8 weeks. With limited pediatric data she was started at the maintenance adult dose of 3 mcg/kg/dose by weekly subcutaneous injection. The dose was increased by 1 mcg/kg each week to the full induction dose of 6 mcg/kg. Following induction she continued on maintenance therapy, 3 mcg/kg/week for 52 weeks. Side effects and organ toxicity were monitored monthly throughout her course. Despite premedication with acetaminophen, the patient experienced a low-grade fever with chills and myalgias following the first dose. Subsequent injections were followed with scheduled acetaminophen for 24 hours, which prevented symptoms. She reported mild fatigue for one to two days following each injection, but denied symptoms of depression, headache, and nausea or vomiting. Monthly laboratory monitoring for myelosuppression, hepatic and renal dysfunction was performed along with a TSH and triglyceride level every three months. No persistent abnormalities were seen. Conclusion: Our patient tolerated pegylated interferon alfa-2b with no significant adverse side effects or organ toxicity. This is the first reported pediatric patient with melanoma treated with this therapy. Background: Tumors with the t (7;12) and ACTB-GLI1 fusion are a recently described entity, usually arising in the soft tissue. Two prior published articles reported six cases, two of them in children, both arising in the tongue. Objectives: To report an unusual gastric tumor arising from the pyloric wall of the stomach in a 9-year old child harboring the exceptionally rare translocation t(7;12) resulting in ACTB-GLI1 gene fusion. Design/Method: Case report Results: A 9-year-old previously healthy female, presented with one episode of abdominal pain and vomiting. An epigastric mass was palpated. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed a localized 6cm X 7cm X 6cm solid and cystic mass arising from the distal stomach. Preoperative differential included gastrointestinal stromal tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. The child underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a mobile mass attached to the anterior portion of pylorus. The mass was completely resected, and a Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty was performed. Microscopic examination of the mass revealed a spindle cell proliferation diffusely positive for CD56 and vimentin and focally for EMA and CD10. Initially the pathology was reported as angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma. Cytogenetic studies showed a balanced translocation involving the short arm of chromosome 7 at p22 and the long arm of chromosome 12 at q13 [46,XX,t(7;12)(p22;q13)]. The diagnosis was changed to pericytoma t(7:12). The presence of ACTB-GLI1 fusion transcripts was confirmed by RT-PCR and genomic DNA amplification. The child was in remission at 6 months follow-up. Conclusion: Our case is the first report of a gastric tumor with the translocation t(7;12)(p22;q13) and confirmed ACTB-GLI fusion gene, in a pediatric patient. The unusual location and morphology made the differential diagnosis quite difficult, making genetic and molecular analyses imperative for the correct diagnosis. No evidence of recurrence or metastasis has been documented in the prior reported cases and resection seems to be the treatment of choice. He has a history of refractory epilepsy, severe intellectual disability and was diagnosed using whole exome sequencing with a very rare potassium channelopathy due to a heterozygous mutation in the KCNT1 gene. He also has a history of recurrent volvulus with significant colonic resection, pseudo-obstructive syndrome with colonic neuropathy and TPN-dependent intestinal malabsorption. Results: Colonoscopy revealed a tubular villous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia consistent with CIN. Staging workup, including CEA and CA19-9 evaluation was negative. Reanalysis of the exomic data for 56 known cancer-related genes revealed a heterozygous c.851C>G mutation resulting in a stop codon p.Ser284X in the PMS2 gene, not present in his mother's exome sequencing. Conclusion: This case report presents a novel PMS2 mutation, uniquely observed in a patient with a known channelopathy. The emerging role of PMS2 mutation in pediatric cancer, possible mechanisms of a second hit and the therapeutic dilemma of CIN in patients with LS are important considerations illustrated by this unique case. We will also highlight the ethical dilemmas surrounding reporting of incidental findings in whole exome sequencing in the context of detection of clinical oncogenetic potential.",

They fall along a spectrum of tumor maturity, which dictates tumor aggression and course. Ganglioneuromas and intermixed ganglioneuroblastomas are the most mature subtypes that tend to present with unifocal disease and have a benign course. Objectives: We present a unique case of a 3-year-old boy with multiple tumors identified at initial presentation, with histology consistent with multiple soft tissue ganglioneuromas and an abdominal intermixed ganglioneuroblastoma. Design/Method: Our patient is a previously healthy boy who presented with a mass on the posterior aspect of his right thigh that was increasing in size over a 1-month period. An MRI of his thigh revealed 3 well-circumscribed lesions within the muscle. The biopsy of these lesions was in keeping with a ganglioneuroma. An abdominal MRI performed as part of a staging work-up revealed a mass in the right adrenal fossa. The biopsy of this mass was consistent with an intermixed ganglioneuroblastomas. N-MYC was not amplified in either lesion. The remainder of the staging work-up including urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), a bone scan, bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, and a MIBG scan were unremarkable. Although metastatic disease was present upon presentation, based on the histological subtypes of his tumors, the likelihood of progressive disease was low.

Conclusion: Reports of metastatic ganglioneuromas and intermixed ganglioneuroblastomas in the literature are limited. To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case with concurrent adrenal ganglioneuroblastoma and multiple soft tissue ganglioneuroma metastases present at the initial diagnosis. This rare presentation of multifocal soft tissue ganglioneuromas, with an abdominal intermixed ganglioneuroblastoma, raises the possibility that these lesions were once less mature neuroblastic tumors that underwent maturation. Given the distribution of disease in our patient, it is possible that our patient once had a stage IV-S neuroblastoma, with subsequent maturation of the primary tumor and metastases. Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, and the most common cancer in infancy (1). It is a tumor which may present with a spectrum of paraneoplastic syndromes. Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) has been described in a small number of children with neuroblastoma unrelated to the gastrointestinal involvement by cancer, and has been thought to be either a rare paraneoplastic syndrome due to catecholamine effects on the gut or to lymphatic obstruction from mass effect (2) . Noonan Syndrome has been associated independently with neuroblastoma and with PLE (3). Objectives: To describe the clinical course of phenotypically normal baby with concurrent neuroblastoma and PLE whose tumor DNA was found to have a mutation in the PTPN11 gene. A biopsy was performed, due to tumor unresectability, which noted myofibroblastic proliferation with marked inflammation consistent with IMT. Next-generation sequencing revealed an alteration in the CPS1 (A347S) gene, previously reported as a poor prognostic marker in rectal cancers, and a normal ALK-1 gene. Initially, she was treated with celecoxib and methylprednisolone; however, the tumor ruptured and resulted in abdominal compartment syndrome with hypertension, obstipation, bladder outlet obstruction, and bilateral hydronephrosis. She was then transitioned to VAC chemotherapy, which consisted of a 21-day cycle of vincristine (0.025 mg/kg/dose) weekly, dactinomycin (0.025 mg/kg/dose) on day 1, and cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg/dose) on day 1, in addition to daily celecoxib therapy. She has tolerated 5 cycles of therapy with minimal side effects and occasional growth factor support. The most recent imaging reveals tumor measurements of 3.7\u00d74.2\u00d76.7 cm. She has had complete resolution of her hypertension, obstipation, bladder outlet obstruction, and marked improvement of her bilateral hydronephrosis. She will continue this regimen until complete resection is feasible. Conclusion: VAC used in combination with celecoxib may be a therapeutic option for inoperable ALK-1-negative IMT.",

A response-based local control approach has been attempted in patients with group III vaginal RMS, eliminating the need for RT. Objectives: To describe a new surgical approach for localized vaginal RMS using minimally invasive surgical resection followed by autologous buccal graft vaginoplasty reconstruction. Design/Method: Case series of 3 patients with localized vaginal botryoid RMS from 3 institutions who were treated with chemotherapy as per ARST0331, subset B. Results: All 3 patients were under 3 years of age (range 11-30 months) and had botryoid RMS. All patients received a maximum of 4.8 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide followed by vincristine/dactinomycin therapy. Surgery was performed at different times (weeks 0, 12, and 16), and all patients underwent a subtotal or total vaginectomy with autologous buccal graft vaginoplasty reconstruction. In one patient the surgical margins were positive, and in the other two the closest margins were 1 and 2 mm. No patient received RT.

Background: Pure choriocarcinoma of the testis is a highly malignant tumor derived from trophoblastic cells with the potential for early metastasis. It accounts for 0.3% of all primary testicular germ cell tumors. Given its rarity and propensity in older patients, pure choriocarcinoma is often not in the differential for patients who present at pediatric oncology services.

Design/Method: We report a case of a previously healthy, normally developing, Tanner IV, 14-year-old male patient who presented with an asymmetrically enlarged right testicle following blunt trauma with subsequent right-sided chest pain, fever, and emesis.

The patients in reported cases (n = 17) range from age 18 to 63 years (mean age 31.3). Our patient is the youngest known reported case. Pure choriocarcinoma is often initially misdiagnosed given its tendency to present with symptoms secondary to lung, skin, and/or brain metastasis, as opposed to testicular swelling like other testicular tumors. Its misdiagnosis may be related to the gap in knowledge regarding peri-pubertal testicular tumor differential and workup. While puberty plays an important role in the frequency of testicular tumor types, teenage and adolescent patients, like the presented patient, often fall between pre-and post-pubertal studies in the literature. Research studies often use age cut-offs when studying preversus post-pubertal testicular tumors; yet, the variability of age of puberty onset and the variety of puberty stages suggests that age-defined cut-offs are suboptimal. Conclusion: Peri-pubertal boys are at risk for testicular cancers that are typically identified in the 15-to 35-year-old cohort. Our report of testicular pure choriocarcinoma in a 14-year-old highlights unique characteristics of this tumor and the importance of puberty status in pediatric oncology workup algorithms.",

We found no reports of this mutation but have found a missense mutation resulting in a splicing variant as well as a number of indels occurring at c.672.

Treatment with monthly denosumab 120mg was initiated. Dramatic improvement was noted clinically and radiographically. After forty months asymptomatic and stable, denosumab was discontinued. One month later, he presented with nausea and vomiting, hypercalcemic at 15.5 mg/dL with acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 2.4 mg/dL). Calcitonin, hyperhydration and lasix were unsuccessful. He was treated with denosumab with rapid resolution of hypercalcemia. In the following five months, hypercalcemia recurred twice, both with resolution within 48 hours of treatment with denosumab 20mg and 10mg, respectively. Results: While GCTB is a benign histologic diagnosis, its locally aggressive nature complicates treatment. Definitive management is often surgical, which was precluded by our patient's metastatic disease. Tumor cell expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) interacts with RANK on monocytes, activating osteoclasts, their precursors and giant cells, promoting bone resorption. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody, binds and inhibits RANKL, suppressing bone turnover. Upon discontinuation of denosumab's inhibitory effects, osteoclast hyperactivity may cause rebound hypercalcemia. This phenomenon may be more pronounced in a skeletally immature child with increased rate of bone metabolism. Treatment with denosumab resolves these episodes of hypercalcemia. Conclusion: This patient highlights the utility of low dose denosumab in managing severe hypercalcemic episodes following long-term treatment with denosumab. Further research is needed to determine ideal dosing, effects of recurrent treatment, recommended monitoring and the potential need for gradual discontinuation of therapy.",

            "text": "Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is associated with other autoimmune diseases, namely thyroiditis, celiac disease and autoimmune gastric disease. Two conditions at initial presentation, however, is exceedingly rare. Here we describe a child with novel, simultaneous presentation of thrombocytopenia and hyperglycemia, leading to concurrent diagnoses of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and T1DM. Objectives: Describe a child with severe thrombocytopenia and hyperglycemia, leading to new diagnoses of both ITP and T1DM. Explore known co-morbid autoimmune diagnoses, and the significance behind less commonly reported pairs. Design/Method: A five year-old male presented with bruising. He had a viral URI one week prior. CBC and CMP revealed thrombocytopenia of 2 K/cmm and hyperglycemia to 457 mg/dL. Urinalysis was positive for glucose, negative for ketones. Bleeding history was negative. Physical exam revealed wet purpura and scattered bruises. Presentation was consistent with ITP, and his hyperglycemia was attributed to an acute illness stress response. He received IVIG with platelet improvement to 83 K/cmm. Elevated serum glucose persisted overnight. Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 7.8%, indicating chronic hyperglycemia. Autoantibody testing obtained prior to IVIG demonstrated an elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, diagnostic for T1DM. He started insulin therapy with stabilization of serum glucose. Results: Pleomorphic by nature, with non-specific symptomatology, autoimmune diseases can be challenging, confounded by associated conditions. Genetic and immune dysregulation disorders are considered when presented with associated conditions. Thrombocytopenia and T1DM are an unusual pair. To our knowledge, only five pediatric cases have described this association, none with simultaneous presentation. T1DM results from T cell destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. ITP is mediated by circulating autoantibodies to platelets. Both conditions share a basis in autoimmune dysregulation, but by independent mechanisms. These associations may have significant implications for treatment. Recent studies suggest when traditional treatments fail, rituximab (anti-CD20) therapy targeting B lymphocytes may prove beneficial for many autoimmune disorders, including T1DM and ITP.",

It was recognized in the 1970s in the Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation as a clinically distinct entity from polycythemia vera and has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. A specific mutation in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene results in an R200W amino acid substitution leading to an upregulation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1, HIF-2) despite normal oxygen levels. This leads to a chronic increase in red blood cell production. The mutation is in the VHL gene on chromosome 3p25.4. This mutation was subsequently found in people of European, African-American, and Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnicities. Our patient is a 9",

Objectives: Describe a rare case of Chuvash Polycythemia, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in a pediatric patient. Design/Method: Case Report Results: An extensive workup for polycythemia was conducted after confirming the hgb and hct levels for primary and secondary polycythemia. Work up for polycythemia vera (JAK2, Exon 12&14) was negative and erythopoetin levels were normal. Additionally, P50 (oxygen affinify) studies were found to be normal. Gene testing was performed and revealed a homozygous R200W mutation on the VHL gene, confirming the diagnosis of Chuvash Polycythemia. To date, there is no treatment for Chuvash polycythemia. However, symptom management with phlebotomy is thought to be acceptable. Phlebotomy can help with headaches, ruddy complexion and other morbidity but may lead to iron deficiency anemia. There is also a significant increase in stroke and other thrombotic events in these patients. Paradoxically, there is an increase in bleeding events as well, and some of the strokes are hemorrhagic. Other complications include pulmonary hypertension and hemangiomas. Conclusion: Chuvash polycythemia is a rare cause of polycythemia that should be promptly diagnosed and treated based upon clinical symptoms to prevent long term morbidity or mortality.",

Metastatic evaluation demonstrated sub centimeter nodules in addition to extensive skeletal disease involving the bilateral femurs, bilateral humeri, skull, ribs and pelvis. Complete blood count done prior to biopsy was remarkable for a white blood count 6100/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 12.3g/dl and Platelets 32000/\u03bcl.

This is an extremely rare diagnosis for which there is no defined epidemiologic incidence, and no organized treatment approach. Currently, treatment approaches include steroids alone, immunosuppressive agents, multi-agent chemotherapy and even autologous stem cell transplant. The current 5yr median survival is roughly 80%, but this depends greatly upon the phenotype of the T cell receptor (TCR). The \u03b1\u03b2 phenotype has a significantly better prognosis than the aggressive \u03d2\u03b4 phenotype that is often associated with hemophagocytosis. He was found to have a \u03b2\u03d2 TCR, concerning for the more aggressive phenotype. Thus, we have begun treatment with a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. He has received two cycles of of doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide per AHOD 0431. He is now receiving methotrexate and cytarabine per AALL1231. MRI of the extremities and CT of the abdomen after 2months of therapy showed near resolution in the size and induation of his plaques. We plan to treat for at least 6 months pending response.

Now, they face the challenge of thousands of healthcare mobile applications (apps) available on smart phones. An app is a self-contained program or piece of software designed to run on handheld devices to perform a specific purpose. Objectives: To identify a need for pediatric-specific apps for the pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) community as a tool to improve workflow and enhance trainee and patient education. Design/Method: Hematology/ Oncology MeSH terms from the 2015 list were searched in the Apple iTunes Store as simple keywords in the English language. A master list of unique apps was created and the apps were divided into four categories (medical teaching, provider tools, resources and consumer) and several subcategories. Results: A search of the 51 hematology-oncology MeSH terms in the iTunes Store resulted in 689 apps for the iPhone and 476 apps for the iPad. A total of 41 iPhone apps (6%) were considered potentially useful to the PHO field. Categories of medical teaching (42%) and provider tools (31%) yielded the highest number of interesting apps. However, in resources only 12% were found to be pediatric hem/onc-oriented (staging 0%, journals 6.6%, conferences 0% and few useful handbooks). In consumer-related apps (22% potential useful) only four non-english apps (Spanish) apps were found. Conclusion: Mobile technology and apps are convenient and may lead to superior and faster clinical decision-making, improved accuracy and enhanced productivity for PHOs. However, there is clearly a need for design of pediatric hemato/oncology-specific apps. ASPHO can take the lead in coordinating a response to this fast-moving field by designing and organizing these apps and encourage PHOs for using those new PHO-specific Apps to optimize patient care and education.

Clinical manifestations include fever and abdominal symptoms (pain, distention, cramping, tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea). Diagnosis is confirmed with imaging and treatment is broad spectrum antibiotics. Tuberculous enteritis is rare in the United States (US) with non-specific signs and symptoms, often resulting in diagnostic delays. Objectives: Report AML complicated by both typhlitis and tuberculous enteritis. Design/Method: Case report Results: A 15 year-old Hispanic female with AML received treatment on Children's Oncology Group-protocol (AAML1031-Arm B). Following Induction-I, during neutropenic status, computed tomography (CT) revealed abnormal mucosal enhancement of her ascending colon. CT scans during the remainder of treatment demonstrated necrotic abdominal lymph nodes (LN) and persistent ileocecal inflammation that remained primarily unchanged despite antibiotic therapy and bowel rest. At the end of therapy, she had persistent fevers in the setting of a protracted course with typhlitis. Imaging showed a mildly prominent left supraclavicular LN and partial improvement in the colonic wall thickening with confinement to the cecum and proximal ascending colon. CT also revealed nonspecific pulmonary nodules with no lung parenchymal disease or hilar adenopathy. Excisional biopsy of the left LN showed necrotizing granulomas with rare acid-fast bacilli (AFB). AFB stains, tuberculosis (TB) polymerase chain reaction testing and stool culture were also positive. She was born in the US with family from El Salvador and reported visiting two years prior to her diagnosis. No known TB exposures. Two-weeks after starting anti-tuberculous therapy, she defervesced and neutrophil counts improved. Nine months post completion of therapy she remains in first remission with a hypocellular bone marrow. Bone marrow AFB stains and cultures are negative to date. Conclusion: Tuberculous enteritis is rarely suspected and even harder to identify in pediatric oncology populations due to the overlap in symptoms from their cancer treatment. Published reports of gastrointestinal TB in children commonly reported abdominal pain, fever and weight loss as presenting symptoms highlighting the deceptive clinical presentation of this disease in the setting of a cancer diagnosis. (13), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (9), chronic myelogenous leukemia (3), biphenotypic leukemia (2), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (1) . Donor types were haploidentical (20), matched unrelated donor (4) and matched sibling donor (4). Of the patients that had MC alone, 15 of 16 (94%) responded to DLI. Three of the 15 responders (20%) developed grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and 2 of 15 (13%) developed limited chronic GVHD. Of the patients with MC who were also MRD positive, 2 of 10 (20%) responded to DLI; one of the responders developed extensive chronic GVHD. Both of these responders had low-level MRD (0.04% and 0.03%) at the time of DLI. Of the nonresponders with MC and MRD positive disease, 3 of 8 (38%) developed GVHD. Neither of the 2 patients with MC and morphologic relapse had a response to DLI, nor developed GVHD. MC predated morphologic relapse by 64 and 65 days in the two patients in which DLI was delayed. Conclusion: When administered promptly after evidence of MC alone, DLI from any donor type can increase donor chimerism with a low risk of GVHD, and may prevent relapse. We advocate close monitoring of donor chimerism after HCT and early administration of DLI using a dose escalation regimen.",

            "text": "Background: Donors for patients of African descent requiring a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are limited in national registries. The donor pool is further limited because matched donors are disqualified if the total nucleated cell (TNC) counts of marrow grafts are below required donation thresholds. This is probably more likely in people of African descent who often have lower white blood cell counts than their European counterparts. In addition, for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), TNC thresholds are higher than in other diseases (3.5 -5\u00d7108 TNC/kg of recipient's body weight versus 2\u00d7108 TNC/kg). This threshold was established anecdotally based on the hypothesis that higher TNC dose would decrease the rejection risk. Graft dosing is traditionally done using TNC but CD34 graft content may be a better predictor of transplant outcomes. Objectives: In a diverse population of HSCT donors, determine whether TNC concentration and CD34 percentage differ by ethnicity. Determine whether TNC or CD34 dose affects post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Design/Method: Retrospective chart review of allogeneic HSCT donors and recipients from 2000 to 2014. The Mann Whitney U test was used to compare TNC concentration and CD34 percentage between groups and a univariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate transplant outcomes. Results: We included 132 allogeneic HSCT patients and 134 donors. Diagnoses were: SCD (n = 35, 26.5%), leukemia/lymphoma/myeloma (n = 48, 36.4%), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 7, 5.3%), or other (n = 42, 31%). Donors were Caucasian (37.9%), Black (37.1%), Asian (4.5%), Hispanic (9.1%), and other/unknown (12.9%). TNC concentration of bone marrow grafts was lower for Black vs. non-Black donors (n = 49 vs 85, median 0.16 vs 0.2\u00d7108/ml, p = 0.01). Median CD34 fraction was higher in Black vs. non-Black donors (1.57 vs 1.22%, p = 0.003). Time to engraftment, incidence of acute or chronic GVHD, incidence of rejection, and mortality did not vary significantly based on TNC or CD34 dose. Conclusion: Our data shows significantly lower TNC concentration but higher CD34 fraction in grafts collected from Black vs non-Black donors with no difference in outcomes. This suggests that the TNC threshold for bone marrow harvest should be lower for Black donors.",

Results: As of January 1, 2016, 34 patients (aged 3.7-29.2 years) enrolled in the study at a mean of 6.0\u00b13.3 years after alloHCT.

As survival improves, assessment of long-term outcomes is often hampered by patient attrition and distance from treating centers. Objectives: We piloted a methodology to remotely study parental and patient perspectives of behavioral and emotional functioning following HCT for IMD. Design/Method: The University of Minnesota BMT Database was queried for surviving IMD patients and disease characteristics. Parents/patients were invited for study participation. The Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system was used to electronically administer and retrieve the standardized Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) survey tools in a one-time cross-sectional analysis. The responses for parent/patient pairs were then analyzed by paired samples t-test in the subscale areas of anxiety, depression, atypicality, and attention problems. Results: We identified 421 patients transplanted for IMD between 1982 and 2015. Of 239 survivors, 96 parents and/or patients (40%) were enrolled. Of those, 8 parent/patient pairs successfully completed the BASC-2 surveys. IMD diagnoses included Hurler syndrome (4 pairs), adrenoleukodystrophy (2 pairs), mannosidosis (1 pair) and Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (1 pair). The median time from transplant to assessment was 9.8 years (IQR, 4.7 to 15.6, range 2.1 to 19.9). There was not a significant difference in perceptions of anxiety (p = 0.38), depression (p = 0.16), atypicality (p = 0.11) or attention problems (p = 1.0) when comparing parent and patient responses. The majority of patients performed at average level in comparison to age and gender based norms from a parent (84% of scores) and patient (88% of scores) perspective in all subscales analyzed. Conclusion: Effective, remote assessment of behavioral and emotional function via electronic methods is feasible in a large cohort of IMD patients surviving HCT. Importantly, the scores for anxiety, depression, atypicality, and attention disorders did not significantly differ between parent and patient report. This suggests that when patients are unable to provide self-reported functioning, parent perspectives may serve as adequate representation. Continued follow-up of this population is critical to provide appropriate counseling regarding long-term outcomes for patients and families considering HCT as a treatment option for IMD. Background: Infants and young children who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at increased risk for late effects due to exposure of developing organs to chemotherapy and radiation therapy typically utilized as part of conditioning regimens. Busulfan (Bu)-based myeloablative conditioning regimens were developed to eliminate radiation exposure in these young children with the hope that late effects would be minimized. As most reports of late effects to date have focused on outcomes in older children and adults, there remains a paucity of data regarding late effects in very young children undergoing HSCT following Bu-based regimens.",

            "text": "The median age at transplant was 1 year (range 0.1-2) and median age at follow-up was 13.8 years (range 7.7-23.8). Overall survival at 10 years post-CBT was 93% (range 84.9-96.8). Nearly all patients (98%) experienced at least one significant late effect; two or more late effects were documented in 83.3% of patients and 3 or more in 64.7%. Dental problems were documented in 92.2% of patients. Other commonly observed late effects included short stature (55.9%), cognitive (53.6%), pulmonary (18.6%), and pubertal delay/gonadal failure (14%). Short stature and cognitive deficits were more frequent in patients with inherited metabolic diseases. Conclusion: Avoiding irradiation in the very young undergoing CBT may decrease, but does not eliminate late effects. These results will inform clinical care and guidelines for long-term follow-up, as well as add to the growing information regarding late effects of HSCT in general. Long-term survivors of CBT in infancy and early childhood require regular follow-up to identify these late effects and ameliorate associated consequences. Background: Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at increased risk for invasive fungal disease (IFD). There is no gold standard fungal prophylaxis regimen during HSCT. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) utilizes three alternative dosing strategies for antifungal prophylaxis in this population: genotype-directed voriconazole, alternate-day micafungin and once-weekly liposomal-amphotericinB (L-AmB). There is limited data regarding the efficacy of these regimens or comparing superiority. Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess efficacy of these regimens in preventing IFD in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients. Secondary aims included: safety comparison and pharmacoeconomic assessment. Design/Method: A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients \u08d818 years who received an allogeneic HSCT between January 2010 and July 2015. Proven, probable and possible IFDs were defined using updated 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer' and the 'Mycoses Study Group' definitions and examined during the first 100 days post-transplant. Results: Of the 396 allogeneic transplants performed in 374 patients, 244 patients met inclusion criteria. Seventy-eight patients (32%) received L-AmB, 98 (40%) received micafungin and 68 (28%) received voriconazole starting day zero. Proven or probable IFD occurred in 6 patients; three in the micafungin group (Candida parapsilosis), 2 in the voriconazole group (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata) and 1 in the L-AmB group (Candida glabrata) (p = 0.66). In eighteen patients, antifungal prophylaxis was changed due to 'possible' IFD, 13 (72%) of these occurred in the micafungin group. Overall, the micafungin group had only 2 adverse events (AEs) out of 103 total AEs, compared to 43 in L-AmB and 58 in voriconazole group (p < 0.0001).",

Sub analyses are ongoing to further delineate which of these patients had active GVHD and were on increased immune suppression. These data along with the pharmacoeconomic results will add more insight into risk and benefit balance between each of these regimens. Background: Cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a ubiquitously expressed proline directed serine/threonine kinase. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that Cdk5 activity lies at the cross-roads of neuroscience, inflammation and cancer immune surveillance. Our lab has identified a novel role of Cdk5 in T-cells and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). We hypothesize that Cdk5 inhibition in donor T-cells leads to reduced migration into secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and reduced severity of aGvHD in murine models of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT).",

The translational goal is to use Cdk5 inhibition as a novel strategy to prevent aGvHD. Design/Method: Small molecule inhibitor (CIP5) and Roscovitine were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments for pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5, respectively. Donor T-cells from Cdk5 knockout hematopoietic chimeric mice were adoptively transferred into haploidentical mice (B6 into B6D2F1) to study the role of Cdk5 in T-cell functions and aGvHD. Lineage specific T cell Cdk5 knockout (Cdk5Tko) mice will be used for future experiments. Fluorescence activated cell sorting was used to study quantitative differences in migration of Cdk5Tko and Roscovitine treated donor T-cells versus appropriate controls. Cellular interaction patterns of differentially labeled T-cell subsets were used by real time imaging with 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. Results from our baseline syngeneic experiments will be compared with allogeneic model. Results: 1) Loss of Cdk5 expression in donor T-cells is associated with reduced migration, proliferation and differentiation of donor T-cells. 2) Cdk5 expression is important for development of aGvHD. 3) Loss of Cdk5 in donor T-cells reduces mortality and morbidity due to aGvHD.

We have previously developed knockin mice producing normal (AA) or sickle (SS) human hemoglobin recapitulating severe anemia, hyposthanuria and limited lifespan found in SCD patients. Reduced intensity preparative regimens decrease transplant toxicity and are preferable in non-malignant disorders. Newer agents under development include Treosulfan, an alkylator, and anti-c-kit antibodies (ACK2), which create bone marrow (BM) niches by blocking c-kit function.",

            "text": "Objectives: To optimize non-myeloablative conditioning in a murine model of SCD that allows for sufficient donor RBC chimerism and disease amelioration. Design/Method: Mice received varying conditioning regimens (+/-rescue with control AA marrow), including irradiation (2-8 Gy, TBI), Treosulfan (2-5g/kg; IP), or ACK2 (100-500ug; IP). The hematologic effects of respective treatments were determined by assessment of marrow cellularity, peripheral CBCs, and erythroid donor chimerism (by Iso-electric focusing). Urine concentrating ability, a surrogate of renal tubular function, was also assessed. Results: Erythroid hyperplasia was noted in the BM of SCD mice. ACK2 and Treosulfan, independently and in a dose-dependent manner, decreased BM cellularity and induced cytopenia in control and SCD mice. Overall, SCD mice were able to tolerate \u00df50% dosing of Treosulfan (and TBI), relative to controls. While all Treosulfan-treated SCD mice (3g/kg) had evidence of donor erythroid engraftment 2 weeks post-transplant, only 25% had sustained donor erythroid chimerism. Normalization of reticulocytes and urine osmolality was found in SCD mice with sustained donor erythroid chimerism, while non-engrafted mice remained hyposthanuric. These animals are being followed long-term for fertility and survival. Conclusion: SCD mice closely mimic human disease in phenotype and ablative conditioning intolerance. Treosulfan alone was unable to sustain erythroid chimerism in the majority of SCD-transplanted animals, suggesting that current dosing is non-myeloablative. Nonetheless, animals with at least 50% donor erythroid chimerism had normalization of urine osmolality and CBCs. This is consistent with the clinical experience with SCD transplants where incomplete donor erythroid engraftment is sufficient to ameliorate the disease phenotype. Current studies are now assessing the combinatorial effect of ACK2 and Treosulfan. Background: Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) occurs in around 30% of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. However, TA-TMA in pediatric patients receiving HCT for hemoglobinopathies has largely been undescribed. Herein, we report three patients with hemoglobinopathies whom developed sequelae from severe progressive TA-TMA despite treatment with eculizumab. Patient 1: 2 year old male with sickle cell disease (SCD) presented with TA-TMA related massive pericardial effusion, tamponade and uncontrolled hypertension 70 days post myeloablative matched related umbilical cord blood transplant. Despite discontinuation of tacrolimus, the effusion worsened and he required polypharmacy anti-hypertensive therapy. After treatment with eculizumab, his effusion resolved, hypertension improved, and TMA labs normalized. He is now 20 months post-transplant and continues to have chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR 45 ml/min/1.73m2). Patient 2: 25 year old male with SCD developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with seizures 18 days following reduced-intensity matched sibling bone marrow transplant. Despite discontinuation of tacrolimus, one month later he presented with refractory status epilepticus requiring six anti-epileptics and hypertension. Imaging confirmed recurrence of PRES with left temporal hemorrhage. Laboratory testing was consistent with TA-TMA. Post treatment with eculizumab, his seizures abated and TMA labs normalized. He is currently 15 months post-transplant and has residual neurocognitive defects. Patient 3: 7 year old Asian female with beta-thalassemia major received a myeloablative matched unrelated bone marrow transplant. Six months post-transplant she presented with TMA related intractable hypertension, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and seizures. Renal biopsy and MRI brain showed changes consistent with TMA. She had minimal response to discontinuation of tacrolimus and therapeutic plasma exchange. Following eculizumab therapy, her hematological parameters normalized and she was taken off dialysis. However, she developed severe chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR 35ml/min/1.73m2) and hypertension. She died sixteen months post-transplant due to respiratory failure caused by RSV.",

Further investigation is needed in order to determine if pre-emptive eculizumab may be warranted for treatment of TA-TMA in this seemingly high-risk population. Objectives: The use of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and a CD34+ selected, T-cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft will allow engraftment with a low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Design/Method: Between 2009-2015, ten pediatric SCD patients underwent CD34+selected, T-cell-depleted transplantation from alternative donors. Indications for transplantation included vaso-occlusive pain crisis (n = 6), concurrent Kostmann's (n = 1), stroke (n = 2) and conditional transcranial Doppler, developmental delay with nocturnal hypoxia (n = 1). Patients received a median of 26 pRBC transfusions (range 4-31) within three years prior to transplantation. Conditioning regimen consisted of melphalan 140mg/m2, thiotepa 5mg/kg x 2, fludarabine 40mg/m2\u00d75, and rabbit-ATG 2.5mg/kg x 4 without post-transplant immunosuppression. Six patients received rituximab during conditioning. Seven patients received a planned donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) between days 33 and 42 with methotrexate IV for GVHD prophylaxis on a companion study. Two patients received therapeutic DLI infusions post-transplant. Results: Median age at transplantation was 14.7 years (range 5-23). Eight patients had mismatched-related and two had matched unrelated donors. Median PBSC dose was 18\u00d7106 CD34+/kg (range 9-25) and all patients received <1\u00d7104 CD3+/kg. All patients engrafted with an ANC>500 at median 14.5 days (range 10-17). Nine out of ten patients (90%) are alive with median follow-up of 33 months (range 4-60). Three patients had EBV-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and one died as a consequence of treatment for PTLD. No other serious viral disease was observed. No acute grade II-IV GVHD developed after transplant and before DLI and only one case occurred after DLI. No patient had chronic GVHD. Conclusion: A reduced-intensity conditioning regimen followed by a T-cell-depleted alternative donor transplantation provided reliable engraftment and a low incidence of GVHD. This approach may increase the availability of transplantation for pediatric patients with SCD who do not have a matched sibling donor.",

As the future for umbilical cord blood (UCB) expansion technologies is bright, we assessed whether this typically-overlooked graft characteristic impacted various outcomes following UCB transplantation (UCBT) for non-malignant disorders (NMD). Objectives: To determine the impact of ABO match status on outcomes of interest in patients undergoing first UCBT for NMD. Design/Method: A prospectively maintained institutional BMT program database was queried for all patients undergoing first UCBT for NMD and their demographic, disease and transplant-related characteristics. UCB and recipient ABO compatibility was considered (1) matched, (2) major mismatched (recipient isoagglutinins against UCB antigen), (3) minor mismatched (UCB isoagglutinins against recipient antigen), or (4) bi-directional mismatched. In double UCBT, compatibility status of the dominant unit was considered. The impact of ABO incompatibility was assessed on the following: overall survival, graft failure, aGvHD (grade II-IV and III-IV), cGvHD, times to neutrophil and platelet recovery, post-transplant pRBC transfusion requirements, and donor hematopoietic chimerism. Results: Through December 2014, 270 patients have undergone first UCBT for various NMD. Sixty-one percent had an underlying storage disorder; 26% had marrow failure; 13% had another indication. Among all four ABO compatibility groups, no significant difference was seen in age, gender, NMD diagnosis category, conditioning intensity, HLA-matching, cell dose, number of UCB units, transplant era, performance score, GvHD prophylaxis, or CMV serostatus. ABO compatibility status did not appear to impact any outcomes assessed, though a trend toward increased grade III -IV aGvHD was seen in recipients of major mismatched units. In multivariable and initial subgroup analyses, ABO compatibility did not significantly impact study end-points, including post-transplant pRBC transfusion burden. Conclusion: ABO compatibility status did not appear to impact selected post-transplant outcomes following UCBT for our large NMD cohort. ",

Design/Method: All SCID patients more than 2 years post-transplant attending the post-transplant clinic follow up were invited to answer the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Generic Score Scale v4.0 questionnaires as part of the routine psychology assessment. The PedsQL questionnaires consist of parent and patient reports, both have 6 domains (physical, emotional, social, school, psychosocial and total). Results: Fifty-nine of 88 (67%) patients responded; comprising 45/73 (62%) patients aged >5 years and 49/77 (64%) families. Fourteen children aged <5 years old were excluded from the child questionnaires. Twenty-eight patients were not contactable and three refused.

Parents of IL2RG/JAK3 SCID reported significantly lower QoL in 3 domains compared to UK normal, whilst parents of ADA SCID reported significantly lower QoL across all except the emotional domain. The QoL scores were not significantly different between IL-7Ra and Artemis deficient SCID (all domains). Parents and children of RAG1/2 SCID reported significantly lower QoL in school domain. Parents of IL2RG/JAK3 SCID with on-going intravenous immunoglobulin therapy reported lower QoL compared to those without the therapy. Conclusion: In contrast to previously (1), a number of SCID genotypes were associated with normal QoL. Particular risk factors include ADA SCID and need for ongoing medication.

Conclusion: GVHD following UCBT is not associated with increased mortality",

Mohamed Elshinawy, Nada Al Marhoobi, Rashid Al Abri, Taimoora Alsubhi, Heba Omar, Yasser Wali Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Muscat, OmanBackground: Adenotonsillar hypertrophy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) can predispose to several complications including obstructive sleep apnea, vasocclusive crisis (VOC), pulmonary hypertension, and acute chest syndrome (ACS). Traditionally, all children with sickle cell disease (SCD) indicated for adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy have been exposed to exchange transfusion preoperatively aiming at reduction of both surgical and SCD-related complications in the postoperative period. Objectives: To address the need for transfusion in patients with SCD undergoing adenotonsillectomy and to report its risks and benefits. Design/Method: All patients with SCD admitted in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital for adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy or both from July 2006 till January 2015 were included in the study.

DBA is known in the majority of cases to be caused by haploinsufficiency of one of the small or large ribosomal protein (RP) subunits. In addition, there is a cancer predisposition in DBA. Indeed, somatic and germline RP mutations have been associated with a number of malignancies. Objectives: To quantitate the incidence of neoplasia in patients with DBA.

Baseline PD-1 expression was determined by flow cytometry during cell expansion. CAR T-cells were co-cultured in-vitro with human LM7 OS cells with and without an anti-PD-1 antibody. Cytotoxicity was measured and compared for both groups using a calcein release assay. Change in PD-1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry in both untreated and anti-PD-1 treated CAR T-cells after co-culture at different time points. Purified T-cells served as control. Results: PD-1 expression increased during CAR T-cell and purified T-cell expansion when compared to baseline PD-1 expression. After exposure to tumor cells, surface PD-1 expression decreased on both CAR T-cells and purified T-cells. Successful blockade of surface PD-1 expression was achieved via an anti-PD-1 antibody. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway using the anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with the IL-11R\u03b1 CAR T-cell therapy did not provide additional benefit against LM7 cells (compared to IL-11R\u03b1 CAR T-cells alone.) The same response was noted with control T-cells in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (compared to control T-cells alone).Conclusion: Combination therapy with IL-11R\u03b1 CAR T-cells and an anti-PD-1 antibody against LM7 OS cells did not provide additional benefit to the IL-11R\u03b1 CART-cell therapy alone. Further studies are needed to test how to better combine these therapies, understand the downstream effects of blocking the PD1/PDL-1 pathway in OS, and how blocking this pathway may have an impact on other immunosuppressive pathways.POSTER #723TARGETING AUTOPHAGY IN MYC AMPLIFIED MEDULLOBLASTOMAAditi Bagchi, Jeffery MacKeigan, Albert CorneliusTheVan Andel Research Institute Graduate School, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United  States    Background: Medulloblastoma harboring multiple copy numbers the MYC oncogene is associated with therapeutic resistance and relapse.

Use of fixed dose regimens with minimal laboratory monitoring should be further explored, especially in selected populations, such as post-operative patients.Background: Myelodydsplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of bone marrow disorders frequently terminating in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutually exclusive mutations were recently identified in splicing factors U2AF1, SF3B1, SRSF2, SF3A1, ZRSR2, and LUcL72 in 50-85% of MDS cases. The granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R) is indispensable for normal production of neutrophils. Two of the seven isoforms of CSF3R have clinical relevance: Class I (full-length form) and Class IV (alternatively spliced form). Compared to Class I, Class IV isoform is differentiation-defective and mediates enhanced proliferation. Increased expression of the Class IV isoform has been found in MDS/AML patients. Hypothesis: Aberrant splicing of the CSF3R promoted by mutations in splicing factors drives abnormal granulopoiesis in MDS due to increased expression of the differentiation defective Class IV CSF3R.",

We conducted extensive data extraction from all detailed case reports/series. Data was included in the analysis only when mentioned in the articles. Descriptive statistics were performed, while related variables were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and linear-by-linear test, with p-values < 0.05 considered significant. Results: A total of 142 patients (age 0-18 years) from 101 articles were included in the analysis, with a slight male predominance (64%) and a bimodal age distribution during infancy and mid adolescence. Long-term morbidity (30%), mortality (18%) and acute complications (55%) were assessed as outcomes. Cancer-related SVCS (31% of cases) We have conducted a comprehensive evidence-based analysis of pediatric SVCS. Identified factors such as infant age, multiple signs/symptoms on presentation, lack of collaterals and presence of acute complications may have prognostic utility that can influence clinical advice and surveillance practices. Future studies may benefit from our subgroup analysis and should focus on elucidating outcome-based guidelines for the treatment of pediatric SVCS. Our Preliminary data suggests that JQ1 significantly decreases STAT5 activation in myeloid leukemia cells and significantly inhibits leukemic cell proliferation at levels not toxic to CB cells. Should this be confirmed in further studies, JQ1 may be an alternate therapy for treatment of myeloid leukemia. Woods, Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012.Birkenkamp Leukemia 2001.Wyce Oncotarget 2013.Ott, Blood 2012. DVT location and extension, thrombophilia testing, and outcomes were extracted. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate for predictors. Results: There were 105 cases that met eligibility criteria. Median age at presentation was 1.3 years of age (range, 0 -18 years). Primary clot location was as follows: 5% abdominal, 41% upper extremity, 54% lower extremity. Seventy-seven percent of clots were associated with a central venous catheter. Thrombophilia testing was performed in 49 patients, and was positive in 39% of patients that were screened. Fifty-nine percent of DVTs resolved with anticoagulation. However, there were no statistically significant predictors of thrombosis resolution. PTS was assessed in clinical follow-up in 94 cases, with 14% reporting symptoms. There was no significant difference in the development of PTS by age, sex, primary site, or presence of an inherited or acquired thrombophilia. Conclusion: Our study is one of the larger studies looking at thrombosis resolution and PTS development in children. Though 41% of DVTs did not resolve, only 14% of subjects reported symptoms of PTS at clinic follow-up. There were no statistically significant predictors of either outcome, suggesting that other factors not commonly assessed may be playing a role in adverse outcomes in the treatment of DVTs. Large prospective cohort studies need to be performed to better delineate these findings. Our preliminary data suggests that patients with FLT-3/ITD+ AML may benefit with 2CDA/ara-C + sorafenib as induction and consolidation regimen followed by oral MCT + sorafenib as maintenance. CO has an elevation of 1600m and is considered intermediate altitude.Higher incidences of adult VTEs at altitude have been reported, but there are no studies on the incidence of pediatric VTE at higher altitudes. We hypothesize that children at altitude also have an increased incidence of VTE compared to children at sea level. Objectives: To investigate the incidence of pediatric VTE at intermediate altitude. Design/Method: After obtaining COMIRB approval, a retrospective case control study was performed investigating the pediatric VTE incidence at intermediate altitude. The incidence was determined by identifying patients with distinct ICD-9 diagnoses for VTE seen at Children's Hospital Colorado during 2010-2014. Diagnostic validation was performed through chart review. Patients presenting from outside the Denver area were excluded. Results: 540 unique patients were identified with ICD-9 codes for VTE (males 54%, females 46%). Median age was 13.26 years (range: 1 day to 18.84 years). Patients presenting with primary diagnosis of VTE comprised 29.4% (159 patients) of the population. Patients diagnosed with a secondary VTE within 48 hours of admission made up 30.7% (166 patients) and patients with hospital-acquired VTE diagnosed 48 hours after admission made up another 39.8% (215 patients).The gender distribution of primary VTE patients favored females (59.1%) over males (40.9%) with 75% of patients presenting between 14.73-18.13 years.In consideration of risk factors, 42% had positive family history for thrombophilia or \"blood clots,\" 39% had evidence of inflammation such as a viral illness in the previous 4 weeks before diagnosis, 18% had significantly reduced mobility, 22% of patients took oral contraceptives and 15% were obese. Conclusion: This epidemiologic study of pediatric VTEs diagnosed at a single institution at intermediate altitude suggests that there is an increased rate of VTE at moderate altitude. The incidence was 2 per 10,000 children, which is doubled from the upper limit incidence of 1 child per 10,000 cited by studies at sea level. Comparison of data to other institutions at altitude and additional screening for confounding factors are needed. We constructed a second generation CAR using a VLR sequence targeting CD5 as our antigen recognition sequence and high titer CD5 VLR CAR self-inactivating lentivirus was produced. To test the CAR construct, CD5 expressing Jurkat cells were transduced with various doses of lentivirus, and activation was measured. For cytotoxicity studies, NK-92 cells were used as the effector cell with CCRF-CEM being the target cell. Cytotoxicity was measured at different effector: target ratios using a flow cytometry based assay. Activation directly correlated with lentiviral copy number and CAR expression in Jurkat cells. NK-92 cells expressing the CD5 VLR CAR showed a \u00dftwo fold increase in cytotoxicity towards CCRF-CEM cells when compared with na\u00efve NK-92 cells; however, low transduction efficiency and copy numbers (<0.5) were problematic. To improve, we created a bicistrionic vector expressing GFP and CD5 VLR CAR. Jurkat cells with the new construct showed a direct correlation between GFP expression and activation, thus confirming dual expression and function of both proteins. Transduced NK-92 cells with the new construct were sorted and expanded. These cells expand robustly, demonstrate CAR expression and have the functional characteristics for targeting T-cell disease. Conclusion: Our studies show the usefulness of VLR-derived CARs and provide the foundation to move these studies into preclinical testing as a treatment for relapsed childhood T-ALL. To analyze the clinical data of disease in a developing country with limited resources so that we can predict how can we prevent morbidity and improve the quality of life in our set up.

Over half of parents identified a member of the healthcare team who helped them communicate about decisions, most commonly bedside nurses. These data highlight a potentially important role for besides nurses in supporting communication and decision making for parents in the PICU. While decision regret scores were low and pFS-ICU DM scores were high, room for improvement exists. We aim to discuss the clinical presentation, associated molecular defects, and outcome of five pediatric patients with HPCD as well as review related data in the literature. Design/Method: Data were collected from the medical records of five pediatric patients with HPCD treated at our institution. Literature review included 82 patients with HPCD. We included only papers written in English that provided at least clinical presentation and/or outcome for the cases they studied. Results: Our sample includes two males and three females with median age of two years(2-14 y). Three cases were positive for c.1163 C>T (Ala388Val) mutation while the other two had c.1297 G>A (Gly433Ser). In all cases, PF was atypically delayed beyond the first year of life. Only one case we found in the literature with PF beyond one year and this was positive for c.8514 G>A (Ala267Thr) mutation. Protein C activity was reported less than < 1% in all cases. Blindness was seen in four of our cases in comparison to 16/82 (20%) cases in the literature reviewed. Of the four cases who developed blindness, two were found to have the rare congenital ophthalmic finding of Peter's anomaly. One case had intraocular bleeding shortly after birth preceding PF which occurred 16 month later. In contrast 17/82 (21%) cases in reviewed literature found to have ocular bleeding simultaneously with PF. All patients are survived. Conclusion: We defined two genetic defects causing HPCD with atypical presentation of late-onset PF and isolated intraocular bleeding. No previous reports have provided clinical data for these particular mutations. Weather these molecular defects contributed to this atypical expression is yet to be answered. The association between Peter's anomaly and HPCD has never been reported. This observation merits further study in a large center.Background: Childhood cancer treatment in the US is typically offered at tertiary centers, located in large urban settings. For children who reside in outstate areas, travel increases the family burden of care. Greater distance from the treating hospital is associated with greater economic hardship, emotional stress and family burden. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a community-based pediatric cancer center on burden of care as measured by travel distance, cost and time. Similar results were seen for lymphoma and sarcoma, proportional to the number of scheduled visits in each treatment scenario. Conclusion: Community-based pediatric cancer centers can reduce the burden of care for families by minimizing their travel time and its associated hardships. This analysis does not include travel for unscheduled visits or off-therapy visits, nor does it consider the additional expenses generated by travel (housing, food, child care, missed work).Over the course of a child's cancer treatment, care closer to home magnifies the savings of time and costs, reducing the overall burden of care for families. Our goal was to evaluate if patients with VWD and PFD who were prophylactically treated with IV DDAVP had a lower rate of postoperative bleeding than historical controls who did not receive DDAVP. Design/Method: We performed a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients seen in the coagulation clinic for a DDAVP challenge at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from January 2011 to December 2013. Inclusion criteria were patients under 22 years old who had VWD, low Von Willebrand factor (LVWF) or PFD, responded well to DDAVP and had surgery. Prophylactic IV DDAVP with or without aminocaproic acid was used perioperatively. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative bleeding in the first 24 hours (early bleeding) and between 24 hours and 10 days (late bleeding). Results: Of 194 patients who underwent a DDAVP challenge, 58 had surgery. The mean age was 8.6\u00b14.4 years and 50% were female. 42 patients (72%) had Type 1 VWD, 5 (9%) had LVWF, 10 (17%) had a PFD and 1 (2%) had evidence for both Type 1 VWD and a PFD. These patients underwent 72 procedures. Postoperative aminocaproic acid was used inconsistently. There was no early postoperative bleeding for any patient and 3 patients (4%) had late bleeding, all after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. 27 procedures (38%) were a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy and had a bleeding rate of 11%. None of our patients who had other procedures developed postoperative bleeding. Published bleeding rates for large series of untreated patients with known bleeding disorders were as high as 32%. Conclusion: Patients with VWD and PFD who received prophylactic IV DDAVP had a lower rate of postoperative bleeding versus untreated patients with the same diagnoses. It is unclear if aminocaproic acid provides additional benefit.SPEAKING TO THE \"NEW NORMAL\": WOULD FAMILIES VALUE A DAY 100 TALK IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF CANCER CARE?Angela Feraco, Joshua Gagne, Sarah Brand, Susan Block, Joanne WolfeDana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United StatesBackground: The first six months of childhood cancer treatment may lead to changed illness understanding and altered communication needs among families compared with those at diagnosis, but currently, there is no framework to guide communication in this early treatment period.

Results: Median age at diagnosis for both groups was 4.8 years with ranges (min: 1.1-max: 13.8) & (min: 1.1-max: 14.8) for relapsed and non-relapsed respectively.12 (19%) were more than 10 years in relapsed whereas 55(14%) in other group. 7%) T-cell and 16(4%) Biphenotyptic in others. 23(36.5%) patients in relapsed group had abnormal cytogenetics compare to 110 (28%) in others. Amongst relapsed 1(1.58%) was positive for MLL against 12(3%) in others whereas Trisomies 4, 10 or 17 was positive in 2(3%) in relapsed vs 56 patients (14.2%) in non-relapsed .26 patients (41.2%) died in relapsed group with a five year overall survival of 56.8% compare to 12deaths (3%) in non-relapsed with a five year overall survival of 97%(P<0.001) and a five year event free survival of 11.1% and 97% respectively (P<0.001).Background: Treatment response is considered the most important prognostic indicator for Pediatric Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Also induction phase therapy carries the highest mortality risk for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia due to disease complications and treatment related toxicity. This audit reviewed treatment response at day 28 and mortality characteristics for children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia at completion of induction therapy. Objectives: To evaluate the end of induction morphological remission status and mortality among children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. Design/Method: Retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the remission status and mortality characteristics at the end of induction therapy among pediatric leukemic patients treated from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2014. Charts were reviewed to look for clinical characteristics of the disease, bone marrow morphological remission status and mortality characteristics at day 28 of the (MNH ALL protocollocally revised from the UKALL2003) induction phase therapy.Results: Acute leukemia accounted for 16.66% (156/629) of all children treated. Out of which 105 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 86.62% (92/105) had files reviewed. At the end of induction therapy, 70.65% (65/92) of the patients were alive, 63.03%(41/65) got treated on an intermediate-risk regimen and 36.93%(24/65) on the low risk regimen. At the end of induction therapy 31.7% (13/41) of the patients on the intermediate risk regimen and 33.3%(8/24) on low risk regimen were confirmed to be in morphological remission respectively. For the remainder of the patients, 40.07% (28/65 bone marrow samples were not taken on day 28 or the results were reported as inconclusive. By day 28, 29.35%(27/92) of the patients died before the end of induction therapy and the causes of death included anemia and bleeding, febrile neutropenia and tumor lysis syndrome.Conclusion:The results of this audit highlight the need to improve our documentation and attention to protocol requirements. Induction phase mortality was unacceptably high underscoring the need for efforts to improve early access to treatment and improvements of supportive care for patients presenting with high disease burden and experiencing high treatment related toxicity rates.POSTER #628A PHASE I PHARMACOKINETIC AND SAFETY STUDY OF INTRAVENOUS L-CITRULLINE IN STEADY STATE SICKLE CELL DISEASE Hafsat Mashegu, Frederick Barr, Rommel Tirona, Marshall Summar, Kim Adcock, Richard Ogletree, Gary Cunningham, Melissa Rhodes, Suvankar Majumdar University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, United States",

Intensification of treatment lead to significant improvement in cancer outcomes and also to significant complications. Admission to Pediatric Oncology Intensive Care Unit (POICU) is a costly event. Pediatric risk of mortality score (PRISM III) is a physiologically based predictor for outcome of critically ill patients. Objectives: Assessment of the efficacy of PRISM III in predicting the risk of mortality in patients with cancer admitted to POICU, following them up during POICU stay, assessing the relationship between PRISM III and length of stay in POICU and assessing the effect of other factors as type of malignancy, septic shock, number of organ failures and type of intervention used on mortality risk in POICU Design/Method: A prospective study conducted from 1\\1\\2014 to 1\\1\\2015 in four-bedded POICU, Pediatric Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute (SECI), Assiut University. The study population consisted of pediatric cancer patients admitted to POICU from Pediatric Oncology Department. Results: One hundred twenty three pediatric cancer patients were admitted to POICU. Median age was 5 years(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15).Male: Female ratio was 2:1.Death rate was 20%.Patients with hematological malignancies and lymphomas represented 75%.Sepsis and respiratory failure were the main indications of admission. Median length of stay was 5 days.First PRISM III (within the 1st 24 hours of admission) mean was 19 (0-61).First PRISM III correlated significantly with outcome (p = 0.000), indication of admission (p = 0.000).First PRISM III correlated weakly positive with length of stay (r = 0.2 p = 0.024).PRISM III was done serially every 3 days during POICU admission. At discharge, Mean PRISM III for survivors was 5 (0-25) p = 0.000 Mean PRISM III for non survivors was 40 (19-61) p = 0.004. Outcome also correlated with number of organ failures (p = 0.000), indication of admission (p = 0.03), stage of treatment (p = 0.001) and intervention used (inotropes (p = 0.000), ventilation (p = 0.000), oxygen therapy (p = 0.015). Conclusion: PRISM III can be used in predicting risk of mortality and following up patients with cancer admitted to POICU. Cancer related risk factors as indication of admission, stage of treatment and number of organ failures should be considered.ESTABLISHING A ROLE FOR ASTHMA MANAGEMENT AS ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISIS Taumoha Ghosh, Lorraine Canham, Ashley Munchel, Regina Macatangay University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, United States",

Cure rates are much lower in low-income countries (LIC). Lack of technology to perform accurate risk-classification contributes to this disparity. The assessment of the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery at the end of induction has been reported as a significant independent predictor of ALL survival in HIC. Objectives: to determine if early recovery of absolute lymphocyte count ALC is an independent prognostic factor for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving standardized therapy in Guatemala, a low income country (LIC). Design/Method: Retrospective review of patient's age 0 -18 year with ALL, treated at Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica (UNOP) in Guatemala, between May 2007 and May 2011. Results: 389 eligible patients were included, 349 were evaluable: 274 were < 10 years of age, and 295 had < 50,000 WBC at the time of diagnosis. 232 had negative CNS, 105 positive CNS and 51 no data available. The majority of patients had pre-B ALL. There was not ability to do cytogenetic analysis. The ALC recovery at day 8 (ALC-8), 15 (ALC-15) and 33 (ALC-33) were assessed. ALC-15 and ALC-33 were significant discriminators of prognosis. Patients with an ALC-15 <350 cells/\u03bcL (n = had a 3-year EFS of 45% (P = 0.002) vs. 66% with an ALC-15 >350 cells/\u03bcL (P = 0.0415). Three-year EFS for patients with ALC-33 <350 cells/\u03bcL was 30% vs. 68% for patients with an ALC-33 > 350cells/ml (P = 0.0024. Conclusion: ALC <350 cells/\u03bcL during induction predicts poor prognosis in Guatemalan children with ALL. ALC-15 and ALC-33 \u08d9 or \u08d8 350cells/\u03bcL differentiates survival groups by a difference of 21% and 38%, respectively. This finding implies that a patient with an ALC-15 and ALC-33 <350 cells/\u03bcL has a 68% higher probability of recurrence compared with a patient with an ALC-15 and ALC-33 > 350cells/\u03bcL. In LIC the ALC recovery at the end of induction may be used as a surrogate of MRD to allow post-induction risk stratification for ALL. This finding needs to be confirmed prospectively in current ALL therapy in Guatemala. FLOW CYTOMETRY OF RED CELL BOUND IMMUNOGLOBULIN TO EVALUATE ALLOANTIBODY FORMATION IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE Melissa Frei-Jones, Wendy Beres, Sandra Nance, Geralyn Meny University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas, United States Background: Blood transfusions are essential in the treatment and prevention of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)-related morbidity and mortality. Standard ABO/Rh cross matching attempts to prevent acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, but does not address alloantibody formation. The risk of developing alloantibodies after a single transfusion is 2%, but may be as high as 8-13% in patients receiving multiple or chronic transfusions. Objectives: To evaluate the use of flow cytometry (FC) to detect red cell bound immunoglobulin in patients with SCD. Design/Method: An IRB-approved, prospective cohort study was performed. All patients with SCD of any genotype between 0-21 years were eligible, with no exclusion criteria. Baseline testing included serologic tests, direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) by FC and tube and Gel techniques; repeated every six months, on acute admission and two weeks after discharge. FC and Gel testing was performed using de-identified, blind samples. Clinical data including SCD genotype, number of transfusions, alloantibody history, and medications were collected. Results: Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled; 38% (11/29) were male; average age 14 years (range 1-19) with 76% (22/29) SCD-SS, 10% (3/29) SCD-SC, and 14% (4/29) SCD-SB0/+. Transfusion history included 14% (4/29) chronic transfusions; 72% (21/29) at least one transfusion; 14% (4/29) no previous transfusion. Standard serologic tests were positive in one patient with concordant gel and FC results. Eight patients had negative serologic, tube, gel and FC results. Thirteen patients had negative serologic, tube and gel tests, but positive FC results. Four patients had negative serologic tests but positive tube or gel tests with concordant FC results. One patient had insufficient sample. Seven patients had multiple samples; four progressed from IgM to IgG on FC with negative serologic tests. One patient became IgM and IgG positive and subsequently developed clinical evidence of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction although serologic testing remained negative and maintained positive red cell bound IgG on subsequent FC testing. The patients whose samples were negative in all tests had no signs of clinical transfusion reaction. Conclusion: We present a novel method used to evaluate red cell destruction in patients with SCD. Further investigation correlating FC results with alloantibody formation is needed. RELATIVE FREQUENCY AND SURVIVAL OF DIFFERENT IMMUNOPHENOTYPES OF ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS ADMITTED AT MUHIMBILI NATIONAL HOSPITAL, TANZANIA Catherine Taylor, Shakilu Jumanne, Sean Rooney, Luke Harrington, Patricia Scanlan Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Background: Internationally, the proportion of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) diagnosed of T-lineage is around 10-15%. Some studies suggest that T-cell ALL may be more common in non-Caucasian populations. There have been no published series of ALL with immunophenotyping in sub-Saharan Africa. Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) has the only comprehensive pediatric oncology service center in Tanzania and flow cytometry has been recently established in clinical use. Objectives: To determine the relative frequencies and overall survival of different immunophenotypes amongst new diagnoses of ALL at MNH. Design/Method: Retrospective cohort study of children aged 0-20 years diagnosed with ALL at MNH June 2012-June 2015. The majority of flow cytometry was done at MNH using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur with remote review by medical scientists and hematologists Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Ireland. If the FACSCalibur was unavailable or results were equivocal, samples were shipped to Ireland for flow cytometry (in TransFix solution(tm)) or for histopathology. All of the patients were treated with a modified UKALL protocol. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meier method and compared using Log-rank test. Medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: We identified 151 patients with ALL or suspected ALL, Charts were available for 95% (144/151). Of those with a known immunophenotype 31.1% (n = 32/103) hadT-cell ALL, 64.1% had pre-B cell ALL (n = 66/102) and 4.9% (n = 5/103) had other immunophenotypes including mixed lineage, Burkitt and NK cell. Twenty-four had an unknown immunophenotype of ALL and 17 died with a working diagnosis of acute leukemia before definitive diagnosis of ALL was made. Patients with T-cell ALL had worse overall survival compared to pre-B cell ALL (Kaplan-Meier log rank p = 0.045), were older (median 10 vs 5 years; p = 0.08) and had higher white cell counts at diagnosis (median 146\u00d7109/L vs 26\u00d7109/L; p<0.001).Conclusion:In this cohort of East African pediatric patients with ALL we have found that, in contrast to published series, the proportion of T-ALL is over double that seen on the large consortium trials in the US and Europe. This may reflect biologic differences in ALL in this population. As expected, the patients with T-cell ALL have worse survival and higher risk features.EVALUATION OF AN ORAL MORPHINE PROTOCOL FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE PAIN CRISIS IN SICKLE CELL PATIENTS IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTINGHugo Paquin, Evelyne D. Trottier, Yves Pastore, Nancy Robitaille, Marie-Joelle Dor\u00e9 Bergeron, Benoit Bailey CHU Ste-Justine, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada Background: Sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is one of the most frequent causes of emergency visit and admission in children with this condition.Objectives: To evaluate whether the implementation of an oral morphine protocol has led to improved care of sickle cell disease (SCD), translated by a reduced hospitalization rate, an increased oral administration rate and faster opiate administration time, comparing cohorts of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) and hematology outpatient clinic (HOC) with VOC pre and post implementation. Design/Method: Retrospective chart review of patients with SCD followed at CHU Ste-Justine. Patients with a VOC diagnosis during the study periods were selected in each department's database. The primary outcome was to evaluate the hospitalization rate. The rate of oral administration and the opiate administration time were also calculated. We estimated that 35 patients per arm would be sufficiently powered to detect at least a 30% rate reduction of admissions, with a power of 80% and a significance of 0.05. Results: Over the two periods, a total of 105 patients were included from the ED and 62 patients from the HOC. Both departments showed a reduction in hospitalization rate: a difference of 48% (95% CI 32, 61) in ED and 38% (95% CI 13, 57) in HOC. Both showed an increase in the rate of oral administration: a difference of 36% (95% CI 19, 50) in ED and 33% (95% CI 8, 53) in HOC. There was a non-significant difference of 10 min (95% CI -10, 25) in the opiate administration time in ED, as opposed to HOC where a significant difference of -45 min (95% CI -71, -6) was found, with both presenting median times over the recommended 60 minutes post implementation. Both settings showed an increase in the percentage of patients without IVs; a difference of 17% (95% CI 4, 30) in ED and 55% (95% CI 72, 31) in HOC.Conclusion:This study validates the use of our oral morphine protocol for the treatment of VOC, by showing a significant reduction in hospitalization rates. Although delays remain in our opiate administration time, our protocol decreased the number of IV procedures.THE ROLE OF IMMUNOPHENOTYPING AND CYTOGENETICS IN ACUTEMYELOID LEUKEMIA PROGNOSIS: 10 YEARS PROFILE IN A PAEDIATRIC BRAZILIAN HOSPITAL Ana Luiza Fabro, Juliana Nardelli, Ana Paula Azambuja, Flora Watanabe, Edna Carboni, Ana Paula Pedro Bom, Gabriela Fernandes Luiz, Camile Vicentini, Cilmara Kuwahara, Samantha Nichele, Euripides Ferreira Hospital Pequeno Pr\u00edncipe, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil Background: The aid of immunophenotyping and cytogenetics became essential complement to the study of AML, because the prognosis is directly related to patient risk stratification, as well as the established treatment. Objectives: Identify the phenotypes that were related to greater or lesser survival of patients and evaluate the response to induction treatment correlated with cytogenetic and phenotypic profile. Design/Method: Conducted review of medical records of children with AML diagnosed and treated in the Pequeno Principe Hospital between January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2012. Results: Evaluated 67 children, included 50 (34 children were treated according to BFM-98 protocol, 3 St. Jude AML protocol 02, the 2-BFM 87, BFM 2004 and 1st BFM-83). 27 boys. The age ranged from three days to 17 years, median of 6.98 years.",

Drug labeling gives prescribing guidance for use in adults, but use in children is based on expert consensus and not randomized trials. This leads to variation in HU initiation, counseling, monitoring, and discontinuation. Objectives: To describe prescribing practices of HU for children with SCD, and identify areas for improvement. Design/Method: We conducted an online survey of HU prescribing practices among providers in the New England Pediatric Sickle Cell Consortium caring for approximately 1000 children with SCD, from September-October 2013. Results: We had responses from 13 providers from 10 New England institutions. Six providers estimated that they had > 50% of eligible patients on HU. HU initiation indications used by >70% of respondents included: all patients with hemoglobin SS and SB0-thalassemia, conditional TCD velocities, \u08d93 pain episodes/year, multiple hospitalizations, and parental request. All providers felt HU was safe for children >2 years old, 7/11 offered it in children <2 years. Respondents reported that patient or family declining was the most common reason for not initiating HU; reasons given included the increased frequency of office visits, difficulty of daily medications, fear of side effects, concerns for dependency, and loss of fertility. Other reasons for ineligibility included hepatic or renal dysfunction, splenic sequestration, neutropenia, high baseline hemoglobin, and history of poor adherence. 90% of prescribers either provided or referred patients for counseling about birth control, 7/12 performed urine pregnancy tests routinely, and 33% of providers required documentation of birth control in females. Respondents typically started HU at 15-20 mg/kg/d, but maintenance doses varied widely, from 15 to 35mg/kg/d. Lab monitoring was done every 2-4 weeks during escalation, and every 2-3 months with stable dosing. Adherence was most commonly monitored by self-report and inferred by lab values. The top three indications to discontinue HU included missed visits, poor adherence or neutropenia.",

Treatment is multimodal and includes anti-inflammatories like corticosteroids. While systemic corticosteroids may decrease length of hospital stay for ACS, the risk of readmission for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) has limited their use. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may be a safe alternative, but efficacy is currently unknown. Objectives: To investigate the effects of initiation of ICS at the time of hospital admission in reducing ACS morbidity. Design/Method: A case control study compared SCD patients with a discharge diagnosis of ACS who received ICS (cases) at admission to those who did not (controls). History of asthma and severity of ACS (unilateral infiltrate vs. bilateral) were collected. Outcome measures included transfusion and oxygen requirement, rate of PICU transfer, intubation, or BiPAP initiation, and need for readmission. Statistical analyses included Pearson chi-square and student t-tests. Results: One hundred twenty SCD patients (55 controls, 65 cases) were included in this study. A significantly higher proportion of controls had bilateral infiltrates (40% vs. 20% of cases, p = 0.03), but fewer had asthma (12.7% vs. 52.3% of cases, p<0.001). Twelve cases (18.3%) and 9 controls (16.3%) were transferred to the PICU (p = 0.80). While a lower proportion of cases required intubation (8.3% vs. 33.3% of controls, p = 0.15), more cases required BiPAP (15.3% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.02).",

To develop and implement a population-based SCA newborn screening and neonatal infection prevention program in Blantyre, Malawi to set the foundation for sustainable longitudinal care. Design/Method: The University of California Los Angeles, the Pediatrics Department at Blantyre's Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, and a UK Malawi based charity, Friends of Sick Children in Malawi initiated a collaborative effort in September 2015 to build local SCA screening capacity for 1,500 Blantyre children age 0 to 12 months.Three screening methods (RFLP, cellulose acetate, and gel electrophoresis) were tested to determine the most accurate and feasible method. A local research nurse conducted SCA education, mapped residences and conducted home visits, built population level trust, and promoted long-term SCA infection prevention adherence. Instituting early detection of SCA in a large Malawi city appears feasible using a multi-institutional collaborative that builds local SCA public health and medical care capacity. Longitudinal data is needed to assess how well screening and infection prevention can reduce morbidity and mortality in children under age 1, and to inform the cost and value of service expansion throughout Malawi.",

            "text": "NEUROFIBROMA VOLUME CHANGES IN NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United StatesBackground: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mutation in the NF1 gene. Approximately 25-40% of patients with NF1 will develop plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Though histologically benign, PN can be associated with significant morbidities. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the effect of targeted therapies on PN volume. However, no previous study has assessed for an association between an increase in PN volume and development of morbidities. Objectives: To utilize data obtained through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NF1 Natural History study to assess the hypothesis that increasing PN volume in NF1 is associated with increased morbidity. Design/Method: Retrospective chart review of patients enrolled on the NF1 Natural History study with \u08d9 10 years of historical data available. Patient morbidities were assessed at two time-points: time of baseline PN MRI with volumetric analysis and time of MRI with maximum PN volume. Many patients with NF1 had significant PN related morbidities even at baseline assessment, and this study reinforces the need for long-term evaluation to see changes in PN associated morbidities. There was an increase in motor morbidity with increased PN volume as well as a trend towards increased need for pain medications with increased PN volume. Future analyses of larger patient populations are ongoing and may help elucidate these associations. The genetic cause of DC varied (one patient with DKC1, five TINF2, two TERT, one RTEL1, one PARN, three with unknown gene). Ten patients (77%) underwent hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for BMF or myelodysplasia. Two patients' PAVMs were diagnosed prior to DC diagnosis, and five (38%) were prior to HCT. Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was decreased out of proportion to other pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including in patients with PF, with reported range of 12-55% of predicted. Bubble echocardiography with agitated saline was indicative of PAVMs in all but one patient. The majority of PAVMs in DC were multiple and microscopic. Conclusion: This case series establishes PAVMs as an important pulmonary phenotype of DC that can occur independently of HPS. Clinicians should be vigilant of respiratory symptoms and abnormal PFTs, particularly decreased DLCO, which are not explained by other pulmonary pathology. Early detection of PAVMs is key to timely symptomatic management, however further research and clinical trials are needed to determine a curative treatment for these patients.",

Objectives: To identify and characterize pediatric malignancies with INI1 loss by IHC and inactivating mutations in the SWI/SNF complex. Design/Method: We conducted a search of the pathology database for tumors with loss of INI1 over a 15 year period(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015). Tumors from 396 pediatric participants in a clinical sequencing study were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing. Tumors with mutations in the SWI/SNF subunits SMARCB1, SMARCA4, and ARID1A were identified. Results: From the pathology database, 78 patients were identified with tumors with INI1 loss by ICH. Tumor types included atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (n = 41), rhabdoid tumor (n = 23), epithelioid sarcoma (n = 7), chordoma (n = 2), and one each of choroid plexus carcinoma, neuroblastoma, papillary carcinoma, glomus tumor, and synovial sarcoma. Tumor sequencing revealed three patients with inactivating mutations in one or more of the SWI/SNF complex subunits: ARID1A, SMARCA4, and SMARCB1. Diagnoses included two patients with glioblastoma multiforme and one patient with malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney. Missense mutations with unknown functional significance in at least one of the three genes were present in 18 cases. Relevant IHC tests to evaluate functional consequence of these variants of unknown significance (VUS) are underway. Conclusion: INI1 loss or inactivating SWI/SNF complex mutations were identified in a variety of pediatric malignancies, some not previously recognized to harbor SWI/SNF inactivation. These results may have implications for the design of future clinical trials of EZH2 inhibitors in pediatric cancer patients.",

Design/Method: A 12 month old female (A) and a 23 month old male (B) both presented with abdominal distension, urinary retention and constipation and were found to have sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT) with somatic transformation to central PNET. In case A, upfront resection was not possible due tumor encasing the rectum. In case B, upfront surgical resection was complicated by tumor rupture. Both were treated with a modified Head Start regimen which consisted of vincristine (VCR) 0.05 mg/kg, cisplatin 3.5 mg/kg, etoposide (VP-16) 4 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide (CTX) 65mg/kg. High-dose methotrexate was excluded from the regimen to avoid additional toxicity since the tumors were extracranial. In case A, chemotherapy was followed by gross total resection with positive margins. Both patients underwent consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with carboplatin 16.7 mg/kg, thiotepa 10 mg/kg and etoposide 8.3 mg/kg followed by autologous peripheral stem cell rescue. Neither patient received radiation therapy. Results: The chemotherapy regimens were tolerated well. Patient A developed post-operative wound dehiscence. Patients A and B are currently without evidence of disease after a follow-up period of 18 months and 12 months respectively. Conclusion: We present two cases of SCTs that underwent SMT into central PNET treated with the same modified Head Start regimen followed by HDCT. High-dose methotrexate was excluded from the regimen since there was no need to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

Retinoid therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cisRA) has contributed to improved outcomes. The synthetic retinoid fenretinide has demonstrated in vitro toxicity against neuroblastoma cells that have developed resistance to other retinoids, and has a favorable toxicity profile in Phase I trials. Skeletal effects, including premature physeal closure, have been described with other retinoids, but have not been described in children treated with fenretinide to date. Objectives: To report two patients with neuroblastoma who developed premature physeal closure following protracted fenretinide therapy. Design/Method: Retrospective chart review Results: Patient 1 (Caucasian girl), and Patient 2 (African American boy) were diagnosed at ages 6 and 5 years respectively with HR stage 4, single copy MYCN neuroblastoma. Both failed induction therapy and received investigational 131I-MIBG followed by consolidation chemotherapy and stem cell rescue, local radiation therapy, and 13cisRA. Due to persistent metastatic disease, both received oral fenretinide (capsular formation, 800 mg PO TID) for a total of 70 and 61 cycles, respectively, and ultimately achieved complete remission. During treatment with fenretinide, both developed asymmetric premature physeal closure of multiple long bones, resulting in limb length discrepancies and angular deformities. Nearly a decade off therapy, both are alive and in remission from neuroblastoma. Conclusion: Phase I and II studies of fenretinide in children have not reported skeletal toxicity as a late effect of therapy. The unusual and strikingly similar radiographic and clinical findings strongly suggest that the skeletal abnormalities may be a consequence of protracted fenretinide exposure. Further study of potential skeletal toxicity in neuroblastoma patients receiving retinoid therapy is indicated to better understand the mechanism and risk factors of retinoid bone toxicity.POSTER #779A NOVEL PMS2 MUTATION IN A YOUNG ADULT WITH KCNT1 POTASSIUM CHANNELOPATHY AND COLORECTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (CIN): A CASE REPORT AND REVIEW OF LITERATUREFadi Nossair, Virginia Kimonis, Lilibeth TornoChildren's Hospital of Orange County, Orange, California, United StatesBackground: Pediatric colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 2.1% of all cancers in patients aged 15-29 years. Lynch syndrome (LS), a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, occurs in 3 -5% of adults with CRC but is rarely seen in pediatrics. Mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 genes result in defective surveillance/repair during DNA replication, resulting in microsatellite instability. If a second hit occurs due to acquired local stresses, malignant transformation may result. PMS2 mutation is more represented in biallelic germline mutations of MMR (>50%), though it accounts for only 2% of LS mutations. Objectives: Report a novel PMS2 gene mutation in a young adult with CIN. Examine the ethical and therapeutic dilemmas highlighted by this case and discuss potential mechanisms of malignant evolution. Design/Method: A 21-year-old male, conceived via sperm donation from a male of Ashkenazi-Jewish descent, presented with persistent rectal bleeding.

The majority of these tumors are functional with approximately 60% of patients experiencing endocrine symptomatology typically characterized by Cushing's syndrome (40%) or a mixed hormonal picture of Cushing syndrome seen in association with virilization. Rarely, patients present with a pure hormonal syndrome of feminization or hyperaldosteronism, 6% and 2.5%, respectively. Objectives: To report a rare case of primary hyperaldosteronism associated to ACC. Design/Method: Case report Results: A 16 year old girl presented with neuromuscular symptoms (inability to rise her arms above her head), severe hypokalemia (1.6mmol/l), hypernatremia (147mmol/l) and borderline hypertension (131/70 mmHg). No signs of virilization were noted. Laboratory evaluation showed hyperaldosteronism with plasma aldosterone 69 ng/dL and plasma renin activity 0.4 ng/mL/h. A CT of the abdomen showed a 5.8 cm noncalcified vascular mass arising from the right adrenal gland, impinging on the posterior inferior vena cava. The patient underwent open adrenalectomy and a diagnosis of stage 3 ACC was made due to the presence of tumor thrombus on the adrenal vein. Pathology report revealed poorly differentiated (grade III) adrenal cortical carcinoma. A strong family history of cancer was noted: mother died at the age of 25 of breast cancer, maternal grandfather had testicular cancer and died of lung cancer at age 47. Maternal great-grandmother died of skin cancer at 29 years old. Maternal great-great grandmother died of breast cancer at the age of 20. A maternal great-aunt died of abdominal organ cancer at 51. This prompted genetics testing that revealed a heterozygous mutation, c.154_157delinsGACCTG in the P53 gene, which is known to be associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The patient's biochemical laboratory data normalized postoperatively. She was enrolled on a COG clinical trial for ACC and completed therapy with mitotane, etoposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin in December 2009. She is currently alive without evidence of disease, but the long-term side effect of adrenal insufficiency. Conclusion: While rare, aldosterone-secreting adrenal cortical carcinomas may occur and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adrenal tumors in children.PTPN11 MUTATION INA CHILD WITH NEUROBLASTOMA AND PROTEIN LOSING ENTEROPATHY: THE MISSING LINK?

            "text": "Design/Method: A 6 month old Caucasian female with PLE was referred for evaluation of a retroperitoneal mass. Laparoscopic biopsy confirmed diagnosis of favorable histology neuroblastoma. It was the unusual constellation of clinical abnormalities which raised concerns about our ability to predict how either the tumor or the PLE would respond to first-line anti-neuroblastoma treatment. This led us to have her tumor evaluated for actionable mutations which might provide treatment options if needed. Results: Next generation sequencing of the tumor identified a mutation in the PTPN11 gene. PTPN11 was normal in her DNA from peripheral blood. Thus, she did not have Noonan Syndrome, the most common form of which results from an autosomal dominantly inherited constitutional PTPN11 mutation. The possibility of mosaicism as an explanation for these comorbidities remains to be evaluated. Conclusion: We conclude that the finding of PLE in children should raise consideration of PTP11 mutations. Identification of mutations of PTPN11 in tumors of patients with neuroblastoma should prompt consideration of study of constitutional and other tissue for evidence of full blown or mosaic Noonan Syndrome. Rare pediatric cancers and increasing capabilities for genetic analysis provide an opportunity to decipher the missing links which explain unusual case presentations including paraneoplastic syndromes.1.

Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice; however, this is not always feasible due to anatomical challenges. Case reports have demonstrated tumor reduction of inoperable IMT's with the use of anti-inflammatory agents, a variety of chemotherapy drug combinations, and targeted therapy with crizotinib for IMT's with ALK-1 gene rearrangement. Currently, a standardized approach for inoperable IMT's has not been established.

Objectives: Three cases of scurvy presenting with hematological complications. Design/Method: Retrospective review of three cases of scurvy presenting to a pediatric hematology/oncology center. Results: Seventeen year-old with gingival hyperplasia, presented with subungual hemorrhages, lower extremity ecchymosis and swelling. Bloodwork revealed hemolytic anemia, hemoglobin of 8 g/dL, total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL and PT/INR 17.1/1.4. Physical exam revealed perifollicular hyperkeratosis with corkscrew hair. Dietary history revealed 1-2 liters of diet Pepsi per day, bread, peanut butter and jelly; devoid of vitamin C containing foods. After ruling out coagulation deficiencies; Vitamin K, Cholecalciferol, and Ascorbic Acid were started empirically, to which he responded remarkably. Five year-old with tuberous sclerosis (TS), on ketogenic diet for epilepsy, presented with difficulty ambulating secondary to bone pain, anemia and petechial rash. CT scans were normal; X-rays of knee, wrist and ankle demonstrated metaphyseal lucency with soft tissue swelling, seen with salter 1 fractures or inflammatory conditions. Bloodwork revealed hemoglobin of 5.6 gm/dl, thrombocytopenia (135,000/mcl) and coagulopathy (PT/INR 16.6/1.4). Inappropriate reticulocyte response prompted bone marrow biopsy which ruled out malignancy. Physical exam, dietary history and negative marrow raised concerns for scurvy and Vitamin C was initiated. She demonstrated immediate clinical improvement. Twelve year-old presented with a year long history of left knee pain, and recent leg limp. MRI and bone scan revealed chronic relapsing multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) versus bone malignancy. Bone biopsy showed osteonecrosis with new bone formation and marrow fibrosis, consistent with CRMO or \"metabolic\" bone disorders. Dietary history revealed a restrictive diet, devoid of fruits and vegetables.All three patient's had vitamin C level <0.1mg/dL Conclusion: Restrictive diets can lead to multiple nutritional deficiencies. Avoidant/Restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), a published DSM V disorder, highlights associations of restrictive diets, pediatrics and nutritional deficiencies(2). Scurvy often presents with bleeding manifestations and bone pain resulting in a referral to pediatric hematologist/oncologist.RARE CASE OF CONGENITAL EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA OF THE HANDMohamed Elsaid, Leys Charles, Kara Gill, Thomas Warner, John Heiner, Diane PuccettiUniversity of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, United StatesBackground: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the single most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. Two-thirds of cases are diagnosed in children younger than six years of age but it is rare in neonates. Extremity tumors present more commonly in adolescents and are frequently of the alveolar type. The presence of a congenital extremity RMS is extremely rare but should be considered in such presentation. Objectives: To increase the clinical suspicion of the congenital embryonal RMS in neonates who present with extremity soft tissue mass. Design/Method: We report a unique case of congenital embryonal RMS of the hand. Immediately after birth, a term neonate was noticed to have an approximately 1cm x 2cm soft mass over the left thenar eminence. There was no overlying skin discoloration noted. The mass size progressively increased over a period of two weeks with dorsal extension, and concomitant change in the mass consistency from soft to hard. On day of life 19, MRI scan of the left hand showed a T2 hyperintense mass that had interdigital extension to the second, third, fourth metacarpals. Surgical biopsy was obtained on day of life 34. The pathology report was consistent with an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, spindle cell variety. Tumor cytogenetic was normal. A clinically non-palpable left axillary lymph node was noticed to be enlarged on staging imaging CT scan. Subsequent biopsy of the left axillary lymph node was negative for metastatic disease. A whole body PET scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease. According to the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG), Pretreatment Staging System our patient disease was stratified as non-metastatic group III intermediate risk RMS. Results: The RMS was treated as per the COG protocol ARST0531 regimen A (VAC only) with multi-agent chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dactinomycin. Local control obtained at with radiocarpal disarticulation. Patient is now 20 months from completion of treatment without evidence of disease relapse. Conclusion: This is the third case in medical literature describes congenital RMS of the hand. Clinicians should be aware of such rare presentation to establish diagnosis and start early treatment.POSTER #787A UNIQUE CASE OF METASTATIC TESTICULAR PURE CHORIOCARCINOMA IN A PERI-PUBERTAL MALE WITH A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURELindy Zhang, Daniel WeiserAlbert Einstein College ofMedicine, Bronx, New York, United States",

            "text": "#790 EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA IN A PATIENT WITH FREEMAN SHELDON SYNDROMERida Abid, Akash Nahar, Jinglan Liu, Ayman Samkari, Marta Rozans, Gregory HalliganSt. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United StatesBackground: Freeman-Sheldon Syndrome (FSS) is a rare distal arthrogryposis characterized by contractures of face and distal extremities. The main cause is mutations in the embryonic skeletal myosin (MYH3) gene that lead to altered muscle physiology. Most patients have one of the three mutations: R672C, R672H, and T178I. Although the incidence of soft tissue sarcomas, especially embryonal RMS (eRMS), is higher in children with abnormal muscle development, it is not reported with FSS. Objectives: We report a case of orbital embryonal rhabdomyosaroma in a child with FSS and discuss a possible association in this population. Design/Method: A five-year-old Caucasian male, with a known diagnosis of FSS, was diagnosed with right orbital eRMS after presenting with five days of progressive right eye swelling. Family history is positive for FSS in mother. His FSS course involved G tube placement, bilateral hearing aids and multiple surgical procedures for marked contractures. Results: Metastatic work up was negative. A microarray (CMA) on the orbital mass revealed cytogenetic heterogeneity, with near triploid chromosomes, with gains, losses, and uniparental disomy. A CMA of the blood showed a normal male karyotype. MYH3 testing on peripheral blood confirmed mutation of C.2015 G>A resulting in amino acid substitution of arginine with histamine p.R672H. He was treated per COG protocol ARST 0031 with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He remains in remission 8 months after completion.Conclusion: MYH3 is important for normal development and expressed mainly in utero but may persist through adult stages, especially in extra-ocular muscles. Mutations in MYH3 lead to aberrant muscle development and possible block in differentiation that predisposes to tumerogenesis. Development of eRMS in our patient could suggest mutated embryonic myosin continues to influence contractile function postnatally and leads to permissive environmental changes for spontaneous development of eRMS. Fernandez et al demonstrated a similar concept with the spontaneous development of muscle derived eRMS after one year of age in mouse models of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2D. Further reporting of similar cases and histologic studies may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism.GEMCITABINE INDUCED RADIATION RECALL MYOSITIS IN A PATIENT WITH RELAPSED NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMADanielle Johnston, Rajkumar Venkatramani, Arnold PaulinoTexas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Houston, Texas, United StatesBackground: Background: Radiation recall is a characterized by inflammation of the skin and superficial tissue in the radiation field following administration of chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin and taxane. Involvement of the skeletal muscle in radiation recall is rare. Objectives: To report on a patient with relapsed nasopharyngeal carcinoma who developed radiation recall myositis following administration of gemcitabine containing regimen. Design/Method: Case report. Results: A 16-year-old female with stage III (T2, N2, M0) nasopharyngeal carcinoma was treated as per Children's Oncology Group protocol ARAR0331. She received 61.2 Gy radiation to the nasopharynx and bilateral neck. At the end of therapy, she developed a new right hip pain. Positron emission tomography scan showed multiple bone metastases along the axial skeleton and a left 9th posterior rib bone and soft tissue lesion. She was started on gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) every 2 weeks. After 4 cycles, she had complete resolution of all lesions. At the end of 7th cycle, she developed bilateral neck swelling and pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck showed diffuse muscle swelling consistent with myositis. The neck swelling resolved spontaneously. After the 8th and final cycle of chemotherapy, the neck swelling recurred. The area of myositis corresponded to the radiation field. She was started on, steroids with immediate improvement. Since then she has required multiple courses of steroids, and is currently on a low-dose maintenance steroid regimen with good control of symptoms for 3 months. Conclusion: Unlike other radiation sensitizing agents, gemcitabine may induce radiation recall injury to deeper tissues. With increasing use of gemcitabine in pediatric salvage regimens, pediatric oncologist should be aware of this rare side effect in patients who have received prior radiation therapy. Steroids can provide symptomatic relief for gemcitabine induced radiation recall myositis.LOCAL CONTROL OF UNRESECTABLE RELAPSED SARCOMA WITH MINIMALLY INASIVE ABLATIVE THERAPIES IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS: SEVEN CASES Destiny Hause, Kacie Steinbrecher, Amanda Ross, Bulent Arslan, Paul KentRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United StatesBackground: Relapsed Osteosarcoma (R-OS) or Relapsed Ewing Sarcoma (R-EWS) has a poor prognosis with a 20-30% 5-year survival. Re-inducing remission with aggressive systemic and local control provides the best chance of survival. When surgery or radiation is not possible, minimally invasive ablative therapies such as Irreversible Electroporation (IRE), Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) or Microwave Ablation (MWA) may offer promising alternatives for local control. IRE has been described for solid tumors, while unreported in primary bony sarcoma. RFA has been described only rarely in pediatric EWS/OS. Objectives: We report outcomes of cases of R-EWS/R-OS treated with minimally ablative therapies for local tumor control. Design/Method: We collected retrospective data on 7 patients with R-EWS/R-OS treated with IRE, RFA and/or MWA in the last 3 years at our institution. Results: Seven patients (median age 19, age range 11-29, 2 R-EWS, 5 R-OS) were treated 13 total times (IREx4, RFAx6, MWAx3). From first intervention, 2 patients are in remission (CR), 2 have stable disease (SD) and 3 had progression and death (PD). The patients included:(1) 12year-old female with R-EWS of sacrum treated with IRE, CR at 27 months;(2) 29year-old male with R-EWS of T10 vertebrae and lung treated with RFA of T10 lesion, CR at 23 months;(3) 21year-old female with R-OS of femur and lung treated with RFAx2 of lung lesions, PD at 11 months; (4) 29 year-old male with R-OB of pelvic bone, spine and lung treated with IREx2 of lung and paraspinal lesions, PD at 6 months;(5) 11year-old male with R-OS of femur, lung and heart treated with RFA of lung lesion, PD at 2 months(6) 17year-old male with R-OS of fibula, femur and lung treated with RFAx1/MWAx2 of lung/paramediastinal lesions, SD at 2 months; (7) 17 year-old male with R-OS of femur, humerus and lung treated with RFAx1/MWAx1/IREx1 of lung lesions, SD at 1 month.Complications included a spinal cord infarction post-operatively (patient 2) and recurrent pneumothorax (patient 6). Conclusion: IRE, RFA and MWA may be promising alternatives to achieve local control of select tumors in children and young adults with metastatic R-EWS/R-OS. Additional research is warranted.REPORT OF A RARE CASE OF PLEUROPULMONARY BLASTOMA WITH DICER1 GENE MUTATION Priscilla Hor, W. Bowman, Anish RayCook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, Texas, United StatesBackground: Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) is a rare pediatric lung tumor typically composed of primitive lung mesenchyme. Studies have reported that familial cases of PPB are associated with DICER1 gene mutations(1). Objectives: Although most congenital lung cysts are benign and require no further intervention, it is important to consider rare entities such as PPB. For patients with PPB, their prognosis is impacted by prompt evaluation, intervention, and histological classification(2). We also aim to stress the importance of DICER1 gene mutation analysis for patients diagnosed with PPB and their families. Design/Method: We report a previously healthy two-year-old girl who presented with a several week history of fever and intermittent cough. Review of family history revealed the patient's father was diagnosed with a right lower lobe lung cyst and underwent surgical resection during adolescence. In addition, the father is currently undergoing evaluation of new thyroid nodules. Computed Tomography of the patient's chest demonstrated a large cystic mass with a solid mural nodule in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. The patient underwent resection of the cyst with corresponding lobectomy. Histological diagnosis was consistent with Type II PPB with negative margins. No evidence of metastatic disease was identified. Results: Through genetic investigation, the patient was found to be positive for DICER1 gene mutation. She is currently receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide, dactinomycin, doxorubicin and vincristine. She remains free of tumor and plans for follow-up include surveillance for malignancies associated with DICER1 gene mutations.Conclusion:The association of this autosomal dominant mutation with PPB has prompted genetic counselling for our patient and others, in order to identify at-risk relatives of all ages with the mutation who may benefit from surveillance (3). Our recommendations include: 1. Increased awareness of this rare tumor among Pediatric Oncologists, Pathologists and Surgeons. 2. Encourage appropriate clinical evaluation of all pediatric lung cysts and surgical resection aimed towards securing negative margins, given that recurrent and metastatic PPBs are associated with poor outcome(2). 3. Stress the need for multi-institutional collaborative research to improve our understanding of DICER1 gene mutations and familial manifestations of PPB.POSTER #794A RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE MALIGNANT RHABDOID TUMOR (MRT) WITH A NOVEL SOMATIC MUTATION IN A THREE-MONTH OLD INFANTJames League-Pascual, Wendy Chang, Patrick Malafronte, Kimberly Fagen, Javed Kahn, Kip Hartman Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, United States Background: The differential diagnosis for a soft tissue mass in an extremity of an infant can span the spectrum of benign, e.g. vascular malformations, fibroblastic tumors, to malignant, e.g. rhabdomyosarcomas. MRT is a very rare and extremely aggressive cancer with a 5-year overall survival of 24% (SEER database). Most occur in the central nervous system and kidneys, and less frequently in soft tissues. Objectives: We present the case of a three-month old previously healthy male who developed a rapidly growing mass within the left axilla. Initial biopsy resulted in the diagnosis of primitive sarcoma, but the tumor exhibited interval growth despite standard chemotherapy. Further pathologic review of the primary biopsy was suspicious for MRT. The tumor continued to progress, and the patient was taken to surgery, requiring extremity amputation due to the extent of neurovascular involvement. A chest CT revealed pulmonary metastasis and the disease progressed rapidly with the patient succumbing to his disease five months after diagnosis. Design/Method: Case Report. Results: Subsequent evaluation of the patient's tumor by whole exome sequencing and SMARCB1 mutation analysis revealed a mutation of the hSNF5/SMARCB1/INI1 gene in exon2, c.118C>T. The mutation is predicted to result in the insertion of a novel stop at codon40 in exon2 (p.Arg40*) resulting in the loss of expression of the INI1 protein. MRTs typically have loss of heterozygosity of SMARCB1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex that drives tumorigenesis by epigenetic dysregulation. Mutations are frequently detected in the germline; our patient is the first to have a somatic mutation of its kind. Epigenetic targeted therapies for SMARCB1 mutations hold promise in the treatment of MRTs. Potential therapeutic agents include inhibitors of histone deacetylation, DNA methylation, histone methylation, cyclin-dependent kinases, and Aurora A kinase. Pre-clinical animal models show promising results in MRT response, and pediatric phase I/II clinical trials are currently underway for several of these agents. Conclusion: This case illustrates the occurrence of a rare malignancy in an infant, the dismal prognosis of MRTs, and the need to pursue improved targeted treatments. Earlier identification of actionable mutations, particularly for SMARCB1, can lead directly to targeted therapies. RECURRENT, SEVERE HYPERCALCEMIA UPON DISCONTINUATION OF LONG-TERM DENOSUMAB FOR TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC METASTATIC GIANT CELL TUMOR Allison Foertsch, Liz Hunt, Alan Homans University of Vermont Children's Hospital, Burlington, Vermont, United States Background: Giant Cell Tumor of Bone (GCTB) is a rare diagnosis in pediatrics, accounting for 1-2% of GCTB diagnoses. Histologically benign, 2% of tumors metastasize. Recent studies have shown response with denosumab, however little long-term data is available.",

Strategies to treat patients with MC have varied. Objectives: Our aim was to study the efficacy and safety of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in patients with leukemia and MC after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Design/Method: We evaluated 28 consecutive patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic HCT at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between July 2005 and February 2014, and received DLI following HCT for MC. MC was defined as 99% or less donor chimerism from 21 days to 1 year after HCT by variable number of tandem repeats. The dose of DLI was based on donor type, and was gradually escalated as tolerated. A patient was considered a responder if donor chimerism increased and there was no evidence of leukemia. Results: Diagnoses included acute myelogenous leukemia",

Background: VOD/SOS is typically considered an unpredictable, potentially life-threatening hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complication; however, there is a known risk post-chemotherapy without HSCT. Severe hepatic VOD/SOS (with multi-organ dysfunction [MOD]) may be associated with >80% mortality. Defibrotide is approved for severe hepatic VOD/SOS treatment in adult and pediatric patients in the EU. In the US, a new drug application was filed in 2015; there are no approved treatments. Objectives: Describe updated efficacy and safety results of defibrotide in patients with VOD/SOS post-chemotherapy. Design/Methods: Defibrotide is available in the US through an ongoing expanded-access protocol for patients with hepatic VOD/SOS (Baltimore/modified Seattle criteria or biopsy) post-HSCT or -chemotherapy, with/without MOD (renal and/or pulmonary dysfunction). Dosing: 25 mg/kg/d, 4 divided doses, recommended for \u08d921 days. Results: Of 857 patients developing VOD/SOS with \u08d91 defibrotide dose through April 18, 2015, 101 (11.8%) received chemotherapy without HSCT; 49 (49%) had MOD. Median age: 7 years (range, 0 months-69.0 years); 81 patients (80%) were \u08d816 years (59 aged 2-11); 55% were male. Most common primary diseases: acute lymphocytic leukemia (49%), acute myelogenous leukemia (13%). Chemotherapeutic agents received by >30% of patients: vincristine, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-L-asparaginase. Gemtuzumab and inotuzumab were received by 2 and 0 patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimated Day+100 survival was 77.0% overall (95% CI, 67.5-84.1%), 71.4% (56.6-82.0%) for patients with MOD, and 82.3% (68.7-90.4%) for patients without MOD. Sixty-two patients (61.4%) reported \u08d91 adverse event (AE): 22 (21.8%) assessed as at least possibly defibrotide-related, most commonly hypotension (4.0%); nausea (3.0%); and vomiting, epistaxis, hematochezia, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary hemorrhages Conclusion: Significant hormonal (growth, thyroid, gonadal) late effects are noted after intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with triple ASCR. In our patient cohort there were minimal renal and cardiac long term effects. Survivors treated for HR-NBL require life-long follow-up to ensure appropriate surveillance for and treatment of such sequelae.",

Severe cases, defined by multi-organ dysfunction (MOD), may result in >80% mortality. Objectives: Present updated day+100 survival and complete response (CR) analyses from the pivotal phase 3 trial on defibrotide in VOD/SOS with MOD, including data obtained in response to US health authorities. Design/Methods: Multicenter, open-label, phase 3 historical control (HC) study. Eligible patients: Baltimore criteria \u08d8day+21 post-SCT, plus MOD (renal and/or pulmonary dysfunction) \u08d8day 28 post-SCT. Exclusion criteria: severe liver or gut graft-versus-host disease, clinically significant bleeding, or need for \u08d92 pressors. A blinded medical review committee determined unequivocal VOD/SOS with MOD in HC patients' medical charts. DF dose: 25 mg/kg/d, 2-hour IV infusions q6hx4. Recommended treatment duration: \u08d921 days. Primary endpoint: day+100 survival. Key secondary endpoint: day+100 CR. Survival and CR rate differences, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using propensity score-adjusted estimates. Number needed to treat (NNT): absolute risk reduction reciprocal (1/ARR); ARR equals the control minus experimental event rates. Results: Patients: 102 defibrotide-treated and 32 HCs. Baseline characteristics were similar. Day+100 survival in the defibrotide and HC groups was 38% and 25%, respectively (propensity-stratified difference in survival: 23.0% [95.1% CI, 5. 2-40.8 ], P = 0.0109), for an NNT of 5 (1/0.23). Observed day+100 CR rates were 25.5% and 12.5% (propensity-stratified difference in CR: 19.0% [95% CI, 3.5-34.6], P = 0.0160), respectively, for an NNT of 6 (1/0.19). In the defibrotide-treated group, 45% had an adverse event (AE), 21% had a serious AE at least possibly related to defibrotide. Patients with \u08d91 AE leading to death were similar between defibrotide and HC patients (64% and 69%), as were hemorrhagic AEs (64%, 75%) and hypotension (39%, 50%). Conclusion: Defibrotide-treated patients had a 23% improvement in day+100 survival and 19% improvement in day+100 CR rate. Based on these numbers, the expected NNTs to prevent one death or achieve one CR are 5 and 6, respectively. Overall hemorrhage and fatal AE incidences were similar between groups; AEs were consistent with those expected in this critically ill population.",

In the US, a new drug application for defibrotide proposed for the treatment of hepatic VOD/SOS with MOD post-HSCT was filed in 2015. In the US, defibrotide has been available through an ongoing, expanded-access study. Objectives: Investigate the impact of time-to-defibrotide treatment initiation (TI) in patients with VOD/SOS with/without MOD post-HSCT. Design/Method: In the expanded-access study, patients with VOD/SOS (Baltimore/modified Seattle criteria or biopsy) with/without renal/pulmonary MOD received defibrotide 25 mg/kg/d in 4 divided doses for a recommended \u08d921 days.Day+100 survival in HSCT patients was examined post hoc based on time from VOD/SOS diagnosis to defibrotide TI. Two analyses were conducted: (1) survival rate by TI for all patients before or after days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14 (Fisher's exact test) ; (2) survival rate for those patients with TI on a particular day: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , and \u08d915 (Cochran-Armitage test for trend across days). Results: Among HSCT patients enrolled through April 18, 2015, who received \u08d91 defibrotide dose, TI date was available for 755 patients (426 with MOD). Defibrotide was started on the day of diagnosis in 31.7% of patients; 93.0% of patients started defibrotide on or before day 7 post-diagnosis. In the population-wide analysis of initiation before/after days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 , and 14, earlier defibrotide TI was associated with higher survival rates, and was statistically significant for all cut-points except day 14 (with only 2.8% of pts with TI post-day 14). In the analysis of relationship between Day+100 survival and TI day, there was a statistically significant trend over time for higher Day+100 survival with earlier initiation (P<.001). Conclusion: Data indicate decreased Day+100 survival associated with longer treatment delays, confirmed by the Cochran-Armitage test (P<.001). Thus, consider defibrotide initiation as soon as possible after VOD/SOS diagnosis (with/without MOD), as no day post-diagnosis provides a viable cut-point for better outcome.",

A 2 year-old female with severe aplastic anemia, following 6 months of neutropenia unresponsive to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor presented with Rhizopus sinusitis obliterating her nasal septum and invading her cribriform plate despite prophylactic therapy with voriconazole for 5 months and 1 month of micafungin.Objectives: Demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-modal approach to Rhizopus infection including surgical debridement, systemic and topical anti-fungal medications, granulocyte infusions and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT); the importance of tailoring pharmacotherapy based on fungal susceptibilities and pharmacokinetic monitoring; and the short-term safety of intravenous posaconazole and isavuconazole in a profoundly immunocompromised pediatric patient. Design/Method: The patient was treated with twice daily intranasal amphotericin B irrigations, periodic surgical sinus debridement with topical amphotericin B washes and tissue sampling. Her initial culture growing Rhizopus revealed susceptibility to posaconazole and amphotericin B. Treatment with oral posaconazole and liposomal amphotericin B preceded alloHCT conditioning (cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin) and radiation by one month. Posaconazole was held during cyclophosphamide administration and restarted as intravenous therapy. During her conditioning regimen and until neutrophil engraftment, the patient received 7 donor granulocyte infusions. After 7 weeks of therapy, the patient's Rhizopus demonstrated resistance to posaconazole and increased amphotericin B MIC. As such, posaconazole was discontinued and amphotericin B dose increased. After isavuconazole was confirmed susceptible, treatment was initiated to achieve a minimum goal trough level of 4 ug/ml. Studies thus far have found no correlation between trough levels and efficacy/safety and no report to date of use in a pediatric patient. The patient engrafted neutrophils on day +14 following alloHCT. Background: Outcomes for high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL) remain sub-optimal. Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) have improved survival rates, but long-term sequelae emerge over time.",

Second malignant neoplasms in this cohort have been reported. Design/Method: We retrospectively reviewed data from 63 patients who were treated on or following the Chicago Pilot 2 protocol; 58 patients who received contemporary standard intensive NBL chemotherapy followed by triple ASCR between 1991 and 2011 were evaluable. Triple ASCR conditioning chemotherapy included: two cycles of carboplatin/etoposide and one cyclophosphamide/thiotepa. All received focal radiation to the primary site of disease; none received total body irradiation. Data included: age at diagnosis, gender, chemo-radiotherapy prior to and post ASCR, height, weight, blood pressure, BUN/Cr, ejection and shortening fractions, fT4/TSH, and gonadal status. Results: Twenty-three patients (40%) are alive; 19 with complete data. Focal radiation sites included: whole abdomen, left flank, right flank, mediastinum, chest, pelvis, focal brain and spine. Short stature, defined as either failure to reach mid-parental height 3 (16%) or growth <5th% 12 (63%), occurred in 15 (79%). Seven patients have hypothyroidism (37%), including 2 with surgical hypothyroidism due to papillary carcinoma. Gonadal failure occurred in 6 (32%; 5 females, 1 male); there were no cardiac morbidities. All had normal renal function as calculated by CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation ( (UCBT= 25, haplo=4) . Acute GVHD complications were the cause for 15 admissions (UCBT=11, haplo=4). Relapse was the etiology of admission in 10 patients (UCBT=8, haplo=2). In both groups, the first readmission and the number of subsequent readmissions did not have an influence on outcome.Conclusion: There was a trend towards more readmissions in the UCBT group. However, significant differences were not reached in number of readmissions caused by each source in this cohort. The leading cause of admissions was documented infections in both groups.

Objectives: We report the first data for pediatric/young adult patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies (n=40) treated with nonmyeloablative haploidentical BMT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy). Design/Method: The majority of patients (n=36) received a preparative regimen of IV fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) days -6 to -2, IV low-dose cyclophosphamide (14.5 mg/kg/day) days -6 and -5, and total body irradiation (200 cGy) day -1. Two patients received the above along with alemtuzumab, and two patients received IV busulfan (0.8mg/kg IV every 12 hours) days -6 to -3 instead of Cy. All patients received haploidentical, T-cell replete bone marrow (n=37) or peripheral blood stem cells (n=3) on Day 0. Post-transplant immunosuppression consisted of IV cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day) days +3 and +4, mycophenolate mofetil through day +35, and tacrolimus through days +60 to +180. Results: Median age was 20 years (range 1-25) and diagnoses included AML (n=9), ALL (n=9), mixed-lineage leukemia (n=1), MDS (n=5), CML (n=1), Hodgkin lymphoma (n=14), and NHL (n=1). Seventeen patients (43%) had undergone prior myeloablative BMT. Donor engraftment occurred in 29/32 (91%) of patients evaluable at Day 60. Median time to neutrophils >500/\u03bcL was 16 days (range 13-22) and platelets >20,000/\u03bcL without transfusion was 18 days (range 12-62). Cumulative incidences of acute GVHD grades II-IV and grades III-IV at day 100 were 33% and 13%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 23%, including 7% moderate-severe chronic GVHD. Transplant related mortality (TRM) at 1 year was 13%; causes included infection (n=3) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (n=1). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 52%. With a median follow-up of 20 months (range 3-148), actuarial overall survival is 58% and event-free survival is 43% at 2 years. Conclusion: We demonstrate excellent rates of engraftment, GVHD, and TRM in pediatric/young adult patients treated with this regimen, comparable to published adult data. This approach is safe and feasible for young patients with high risk hematologic malignancies, including those with co-morbidities that preclude eligibility for myeloablation. Clinical trials are warranted to directly assess the benefit of preparative regimen intensity. Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can halt the progression of Krabbe disease (KD) via engraftment of donor-derived, enzyme-producing cells in the bone marrow, brain, and other organs. While HSCT prior to the development of symptoms is associated with improved survival, there remains a paucity of information regarding the long-term function and quality of life for surviving patients.",

Design/Method: The records of 19 patients followed by the Duke Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program after HSCT for KD at < 2 months of age were reviewed for information regarding long-term functional outcomes. Overall survival and descriptive statistics were calculated. Functional outcomes were compared between those transplanted at <30 days (n = 12) and >30 days of life (n = 7). Results: All patients were diagnosed due to family history (n = 16) or via newborn screening (NBS, n = 3). Median age at transplant was 27 days (range 19-61). Five and 10 year overall survival (OS) post-HSCT were 84.2% (95% CI: 58.7-94.6%) and 78.6% (95% CI: 52.5-91.4%). Median time from transplant was 11.3 years (range 0.01-18.2). One death due to disease progression occurred 15 years post-HSCT. Sixteen patients survived > 5 years post-HSCT. Nine patients (56%) were able to communicate normally. Eleven patients (69%) attended school at the appropriate grade level. Twelve patients (75%) were able to feed themselves independently. Ten patients (63%) remained ambulatory. Poorer outcomes occurred more frequently in those who were transplanted at >30 days than those transplanted at <30 days in the domains of communication (P=0.01), feeding (P=0.01), and mobility (P=0.004). Conclusion: Improved functional outcomes were observed in patients with presymptomatic infantile KD for whom HSCT was performed in the first month of life. Defining this critical period for early intervention emphasizes the need for accelerated pre-HSCT evaluation and decision-making, and will influence public policy regarding NBS. UCBT when compared to other alternative donor sources and has shown that GVHD following UCBT has no impact on overall survival. Objectives: We aimed to define the course and long-term outcomes of GVHD following UCBT. Design/Method: Eighty-one patients were enrolled on an IRB-approved, UCBT trial between January 1996 and July 2007. Thirteen patients were excluded from analysis due to death prior to engraftment (7), graft rejection (4), or re-transplantation (2) . GVHD activity, use of immunosuppressive therapy, and overall survival were collected at 1, 2 Conclusion: Anti-HLA antibodies are detectable in a significant portion of stem cell transplant recipients. Prior pregnancy and >20 prior transfusions are both significant risk factors for the development of anti-HLA antibodies. The presence of general anti-HLA antibodies in the recipient does not correlate with patient outcomes after stem cell transplantation. Background: Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is increasingly used for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with the goal of maintaining therapeutic efficacy while limiting toxicity. Current understanding of late endocrine effects using RIC HSCT is extremely limited. While the risk of infertility after myeloablative HSCT is known to be high (>80%), there is currently no data regarding infertility risk with RIC HSCT.

Subjects were evaluated for pubertal development, hormonal status, and some subjects had a semen analysis performed. Results: Preliminary results were obtained from 14 subjects. Most subjects received Fludarabine and Melphalan +/-Campath, without total body irradiation. Five of 14 subjects (36%) had received prior chemotherapy for malignancy. The median age at time of HSCT was 13.6 years (range 3.4-24.3). The average age at time of evaluation was 20.3 years (range 15.6-25.2), with a median time from HSCT of 5.6 years (range 1.9-10.0). Eleven subjects were pubertal. Of the 9 pubertal subjects with available laboratory testing, only one (11%) had abnormally elevated gonadotropins (LH and FSH). Similarly, only one (11%) had an abnormally low testosterone level. The remainder had normal testing for Tanner stage. Four of 9 (44%) had abnormally low inhibin B levels, suggestive of reduced fertility and Sertoli cell dysfunction. Semen analysis was abnormal in all 8 subjects tested: 7 had azoospermia and 1 had oligoteratospermia. Conclusion: Results suggest that RIC HSCT may be associated with a high risk of infertility. However, gonadotropin and testosterone levels appear to be normal in most young male after RIC HSCT, therefore, normal pubertal development does not ensure normal fertility potential. Our data suggests that inhibin B levels could be a useful screening test; however semen analysis remains the gold standard to test fertility potential. Risk of infertility should be included in counseling about RIC HSCT, and fertility preservation should be discussed and offered prior to HSCT.",

            "text": "Background: Radiation therapy induces chronic oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) leading to impairment of HSC self renewal ability, induction of senescence and increase in oxidative DNA damage. This results in premature exhaustion of HSC reserves with subsequent development of late bone marrow injury. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT-3) is a mitochondrial protein deacetylase which reduces cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by activating mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. Though mitochondria is the seat of cellular respiration and the main source of cellular ROS, it has yet to be proven whether mitigating mitochondrial ROS can play an essential role in HSC maintenance under stress conditions like radiation. Objectives: To determine whether radiation induced chronic oxidative stress can be ameliorated by Sirtuin 3 overexpression. Design/Method: Sirtuin 3 overexpressing transgenic (T3TG) and cre mice strains were used. Each strain of mice was divided into 2 groups. One group was exposed to 6.5 Gy X-ray total body radiation, while the other group was not radiated. All mice were sacrificed 4 weeks later and the HSC population (Lin-ckit+Sca-1+CD150+ ) was isolated. ROS levels were detected after incubating HSCs with 2',7' dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) for 30 min. Data was collected with LSRII flow cytometer and then analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar). Results: On comparing the HSC population between the irradiated and unirradiated cre mice, we noted a 1.6 fold increase in ROS level after radiation. Similarly in the SIRT3 overexpressed mice the HSC population exhibited a 1.5 fold increase in ROS level after radiation. HSCs in both mice strains demonstrated persistent oxidative stress a month after radiation; however the ROS levels of T3TG mice were not significantly lower than in the cre mice. Conclusion: Our study was limited by its small sample size and failure to optimize radiation dose according to the body surface area of the mice. Though we were unable to demonstrate the protective effect of Sirtuin 3 overexpression in significantly decreasing radiation induced chronic oxidative stress, yet our results did show this interesting trend and we aim to explore it further in future experiments after correcting for the aforementioned factors. developed protracted disseminated adenovirus (nasopharynx, gastrointestinal tract, blood) 7 months after HSCT. Due to persistent positive infection and continued concern for GVHD flare of the GI tract, the patient continued on weekly cidofovir for 8 months total, at which time she presented with 2 week history of injected and irritated eyes without other symptoms of infection or GVHD. Patient was referred to ophthalmology. Design/Method: Differential diagnosis included infectious etiologies which were ruled out by chart review and ongoing surveillance as part of standard BMT care (adenovirus pcr, CMV pcr). Results: Diagnosis was chronic bilateral uveitis though complete exam was hindered from poor dilation as a result of iris synechaie. Vitreous was clear and ultrasound of eyes within normal limits. She was treated with cessation of cidofovir and steroid drops, which was feasible at the time due to recent negative blood adenovirus PCRs and absence of diarrhea despite positive stool test.",

Objectives: We hypothesized that chemotherapy preparative regimen was the source of cardiac injury and subsequent LVSD seen in the first 100 days after SCT in pediatric patients. Design/Method: We retrospectively assayed cardiac biomarkers cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from stored specimens in 12 patients with new LVSD and 13 controls, at six time points peri-transplant. LVSD was defined as ejection fraction less than 55% or shortening fraction less than two standard deviations below the age adjusted mean, newly occurring during the first 100 days post-SCT.Results: Among 145 samples tested for cTn-I, elevation \u08d90.03 ng/mL occurred in 49 samples (33.8%), and 15 of 25 patients (60%) had at least one sample with elevated cTn-I. Among 143 samples tested for NT-proBNP, elevation \u08d9450 pg/mL occurred in 80 samples (55.9%), and 21 of 25 patients (84.0%) had at least one sample with elevated NT-proBNP. Among patients with LVSD by day 100, on day 7, 50% had cTn-I \u08d90.03, whereas only 8% of controls had elevated cTn-I (p=0.03). In our cohort, cyclophosphamide preparative chemotherapy (CPC) was associated with new LVSD (8/12 with LVSD v. 2/13 control; p=0.02). No association was seen with previous anthracycline use, cell source, bacteremia, total body irradiation, thrombotic microangiopathy, or acute graft versus host disease. Conclusion: Cardiac injury occurs frequently in patients undergoing SCT as evidenced by elevated cTn-I in up to 34% of patients. In those who develop LVSD in the first 100 days post-SCT, an association with CPC and day 7 cTn-I is evident. We are now prospectively monitoring patients receiving CPC with cTn-I measurements during and after infusion. aGVHD occurred in 25 patients post-HCT -14 with skin only and 9 with GI aGVHD.

However, rates of graft failure in non-malignant populations exceed those of patients with malignant indications for HCT. Salvage conditioning regimens and outcomes for second allogeneic HCT for graft failure vary immensely in the literature. Objectives: We sought to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of a reduced intensity busulfan-based conditioning regimen for patients with non-malignant diseases requiring a second allogeneic HCT for graft failure. Design/Method: We report 19 consecutive patients with non-malignant diseases who underwent a second allogenic HCT for graft failure at the University of Minnesota Children's Hospital from January 2000 to July 2014 using a single reduced intensity regimen. Median time to second HCT was 85 days (IQR 67-119 days). For their second HCT, patients received intravenous busulfan 1.6 mg/kg/day divided Q6H (2.0 mg/kg/day if <4 years of age) on day-8 and day-7 (total 3.2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, respectively), intravenous fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on days -6 to day -2 (total 200 mg/m2), and a single fraction of 200 cGy total body irradiation on day-1. Cyclosporine and mycophenylate mofetil began on day-3 for GvHD prophylaxis. Graft sources included umbilical cord blood in 68%, unrelated bone marrow in 21% and unrelated peripheral blood stem cells in 11% of the patients. Results: Seventy-nine percent of patients (15 of 19) achieved stable donor hematopoiesis, with a 3 year overall survival of 74% (95% CI, 47-88%).

Patients with CHS experience a life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like disorder termed accelerated phase (AP). Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the sole curative therapy to prevent AP. Objectives: Describe the clinical course of a CHS patient who underwent HLA-matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant (MUD BMT) with successful outcome despite very low donor T cell chimerism. Design/Method: Case report. Results: Patient underwent a myeloablative 10/10 MUD-BMT at the age of sixteen months. Preparative regimen included IV busulfan (4.4 mg/kg/day x 4 days with targeted pharmacokinetics) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day x 4 days). He received an unmanipulated bone marrow (BM) graft of 5.21 x 108 TNC/kg. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate. Initial course was complicated by engraftment syndrome and coronavirus requiring intubation and steroids. He had engraftment of neutrophils on day +21 and platelets on day +33. BM donor chimerism was 98% at day +30 but fell to 88% at day +60. Subsequent peripheral blood (PB) monitoring showed T-cell sorted chimerism stable at 89-92%. BM donor chimerism at day +90 was only 43%. Despite an early cyclosporine taper, PB T-cell sorted chimerism continued falling to 41% on day +224 when he began donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). He received a total of 7 DLIs with CD3 doses ranging from 1 x 106/kg to 1 x 108/kg. At the completion of DLI, PB T-cell sorted chimerism was 20%, and whole blood chimerism was 12%. These levels have remained stable for one year. He has had occasional fluctuating mild neutropenia and several viral infections without evidence of AP. Conclusion: Despite recurrence of his underlying disease, the patient is currently alive and well with no episodes of AP during viral infections for 2 years post-BMT. Similar to HLH, very low levels of T-cell donor chimerism may be sufficient for prevention of AP.",

Though transplant-related complications are common in patients with Hurler syndrome, we have observed infrequent hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in this patient population. Furthermore, medical reports suggest a therapeutic effect on severe HC from intra-vesicular administered glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Interestingly, GAG accumulate in high levels in untreated Hurler patients due to impaired catabolism. Objectives: We aimed to determine the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis following HSCT for Hurler syndrome and compare it to that following HSCT for other IMD. Design/Method: We identified all patients with IMD transplanted at our center between 1995 and 2013 following a myeloablative regimen containing cyclophosphamide and/or TBI. Allograft sources varied. The incidence of HC was determined for patients with Hurler syndrome and compared to that in patients with other IMD. Results: 190 patients were included for analysis: 27% with Hurler syndrome; 44%, cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD); 17%, globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD); 12%, other IMD. The observed frequency of HC in each disease was as follows: Hurler syndrome, 2%; cALD, 37%; GLD/MLD, 27%; other IMD, 14% (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between patients with Hurler syndrome and those with non-Hurler IMD with respect to the following characteristics: allograft source, the use of serotherapy, or exposure to TBI. As the median age at transplant between Hurler (1.4 years) and non-Hurler IMD (8.1 years) was significantly different, an age-matched non-Hurler IMD sub-cohort was identified from the larger group (n = 30 patients, median age at HSCT of 1.6 years; p = 0.02, difference in median age at HSCT compared to patients with Hurler syndrome). This age-matched non-Hurler IMD sub-cohort continued to demonstrate a higher incidence of HC compared to patients with Hurler syndrome (14% versus 2%; p = 0.04, difference in observed frequencies).",

Due to wide inter-patient variability from polymorphisms and variable bioavailability within the pediatric population, therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole is essential to assess safety and efficacy. Previously all patients received a standard dose of 4mg/kg every 12 hours. Currently voriconazole is dosed 12mg/kg every 12 hours for patients <2 years and 8mg/kg every 12 hours for patients <2 years in addition to dual anti-fungal therapy with caspofungin until the trough is therapeutic (\u08d9mcg/mL). Results of a study evaluating alterations in voriconazole dosing practice to determine the effect on attaining therapeutic troughs and incidence of breakthrough fungal infections are reported. Objectives: The primary objective was time to first therapeutic voriconazole trough, and secondary objectives included corresponding dose at therapeutic trough, concomitant dosing factors, incidence of breakthrough fungal infections, and adherence to protocol changes. Design/Method: A retrospective single-center chart review of pediatric patients admitted to the BMT service, receiving voriconazole for primary antifungal prophylaxis between July 1, 2011 and August 31, 2014 was performed. Patients were divided based on dosing: weight based versus age-and-weight based. Results: Fifty-seven patients were included for analysis. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between groups. Age-and-weight adjusted dosing increased the probability of reaching a therapeutic trough level by more than six-fold (29 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.05). Higher dosage ), drug-drug interactions ) and the oral formulation of voriconazole ) were associated with a lower probability of achieving a therapeutic level. The incidence of fungal infections was not statistically significant between groups. Overall, protocol adherence also decreased after the institution change.Conclusion: Age-and-weight based dosing is superior to weight based dosing in achieving therapeutic voriconazole trough levels. Due to limitations of the study, we are unable to conclude a definitive association between dose and time to therapeutic trough. Larger, prospective studies should be performed to determine optimal dosing in pediatrics, specifically in children \u08d82 years of age.",

The use of CD3/CD19 depletion as a graft manipulation method helps retain large numbers of important immune cells in the graft as well as \"unaltered\" CD34+ cells.Objectives: The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the outcomes and risk factors for survival of pediatric patients who received an allogeneic transplant from a mismatched and/or full haploidentical relative donor using a CD3/CD19-depleted graft. Objectives: Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) has become an interesting strategy to avoid this problem, but the required T-cell depletion produce a profund and long-lasting inmunosupression, as well as graft failure and rejection. As na\u00efve T-cells (identified by CD45RA expression) are believed to cause graft versus host disease (GvHD), while memory T-cell (CD45RA-) provide inmediate anti-infection, anti-leukemia and anti-rejection effects, allogeneic HCT using CD45RA depletion arises as a novel approach to haplo-HCT. Design/Method: Six children, 5 of them with high-risk malignancies and 1 with a immunodeficiency were transplanted following nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. Each patient received two cell products, one created by CD34 selection and the other through CD45RA depletion from the CD34-fraction by CliniMACS device. Results: Graft consisted in a mean of 7x106/kg CD34+ cells/kg (4,5-9,89x106/kg), 3x105/kg CD3+ cells/kg (6,9x103-1x106/kg), 1x106/kg CD45RA+ cells (1x104-4,98x106/kg) and 7x108/kg CD45RO+ cells (3,8x108-1,9x109/kg). CD45RA depletionresulted in a mean of 3 log (2,2-4,29 log). All six patients engrafted with a mean of 11 days (10-12) and rapidly achieved 100% donor chimerism. No graft failure was observed. Only one patient developed GVHD>II that was sensible to steroids. T-cells led immune recovery. They achieved values higher than 700 cells/mcL and 1000 cells/mcL at day 30 and 60 respectivelly. Most of T cells were both CD8+CD45RAand CD4+CD45RA-T cells (median of 395x106/mm\u00b3 and 243x106/mm\u00b3, respectively), while the number of CD8+45RA+ and CD4+45RA+ cells remained low (median of 0.7x106 and 0.07x106 respectively), recapitulating the CD45RA depleted graft composition. A total of 4 patients presented CMV reactivation, but none progressed to disease. With a mean of 100 days of follow up two patients relapsed, both had minimal residual disease positive at haplo-TPH and two patient died, one debt to leukemia progression and one because cardiogenic shock. Conclusion: CD45RA depleted haplo-HCT is well tolerated with a rapid engraftment, minimal risk of GvHD and an accelerated inmunologic reconstitution.",

Design/Method: A cross-sectional study of IL2RG/JAK3 SCID patients who underwent HSCT from 1987-2012. The conditioning regimens used were reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) (Fludarabine/Melphalan), low toxicity myelo-ablative conditioning (Treosulphan/Fludarabine or Treosulphan/Cyclophosphamide) and myelo-ablative conditioning (MAC) (Busulphan/Cyclophosphamide). CD4+ na\u00efve cells (CD3+CD4+45RA+) measurement was used as an indicator of the thymic output post-transplantation. Background: Reports indicate that pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are frequency afflicted by vitamin D deficiency. Whether vitamin D deficiency affects HSCT outcomes in pediatric patients is yet to be proven. Objectives: To report the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in pediatric patients that underwent HSCT and to determine its short term impact on survival. Design/Method: We reviewed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels performed prospectively before starting HSCT (baseline) and at 100 days after transplantation in children that presented for HSCT from January 2011 to December 2014. We also abstracted demographic, laboratory, co-morbidity and treatment data. Results: Seventy-two children (39 males and 33 females), with a median age of 9 (range 0.25-22 years) were assessed. At the pre-HSCT stage, the median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 25.5ng/ml (range: 19-34ng/ml) with only 2 patients on supplemental therapy. Forty-five of 72 patients (62.5%) had a suboptimal vitamin D level (< 30 ng/mL) before HSCT and about half had severe vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL). Prevalence did not change after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (p-value = 0.7) with 63% of the patients having suboptimal (< 30ng/mL) vitamin D levels and 45% having severe vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/mL) at 100 days after transplantation despite supplemental therapy in 74% of subjects. There were no statistically significant associations between low Vitamin D levels prior to HSCT and the development of acute or chronic GVHD, infectious rates or immune recovery. However, severe vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) at pre-HSCT was associated with decreased overall survival after transplantation (P = .007, 1-year rate of overall survival: 65% versus 92.6%). Conclusion: Majority of pediatric patients that come to transplant have vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D may play a role in outcomes of pediatric HSCT. Further studies investigating its impact are needed. ",
