In those countries that experienced the brunt of the outbreak, health care workers were a primary population at risk for contracting SARS. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS [2], [3], [4] and the virus causes a similar disease in cynomolgous macaques [5].",

After 2\u20137 days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough and short of breathing. The patients' clinical features varied from subclinical, mild to very severe situation, and their disease courses might be from a few days to weeks or months [6], [7]. Treatment of SARS included antiviral drugs and steroid. It has been demonstrated that administration of high dose methylprednisolone [8] or corticosteroid [9] was associated with clinical improvement, especially in subsets of SARS patient with severe pneumonia. However, long-term side effects of high dose steroid have been reported [10]. Today, no clinical or laboratory judgment is accurately used for speculation of the disease progression or evaluating the need of steroid treatment.",

Accordingly, determination of neopterin concentrations in body fluids is useful for the monitoring of cellular (=Th1-type) immune activation in various diseases such as infections, autoimmune diseases, malignant disorders, and to early detect allograft rejection episodes [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. In particular, increased neopterin concentrations in blood or urine are an early and sensitive indicator for the presence of a broad panel of viral infectious diseases including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [11], [20], and the degree of neopterin elevation, e.g., in patients with HIV-1 infection, is of predictive value [11], [20]. During acute infections with HIV-1, cytomegalovirus or rubella, increased neopterin concentrations were observed before specific antibodies became detectable [15], [21], [22], [23]. However, increased neopterin concentrations are not specific for virus infections.",

To confirm our hypothesis, we detected concentration of neopterin in 306 serum samples collected from 129 confirmed SARS patients and 156 sera from healthy blood donors. Our results showed that the level of neopterin markedly increased in acute infection of SARS-CoV as early as the first day of the onset and returned to normal level in the convalescence period. It is also found that the higher level of the neopterin is associated with longer fever period in these patients. Nevertheless, neopterin levels in these patients did not relate to their specific antibody response.",

There is a significant difference in neopterin concentrations between 129 acute SARS sera (34.2 \u00b1 20.0 nmol/L, mean \u00b1 SD) and either 129 convalescent SARS sera (5.1 \u00b1 1.9 nmol/L) or 156 healthy blood donors (6.7 \u00b1 2.0 nmol/L). All SARS patients had elevated neopterin concentrations (>10 nmol/L) within 9 days after the onset. In contrast, the mean CRP concentrations in both acute and convalescent SARS sera were found below the reference level (<10 mg/L). The kinetics of neopterin concentrations based on the 129 SARS patients indicates that an early neopterin elevation can be detected already 1 day after the onset of symptoms and quickly reaches its peak level 3 days after the onset. The neopterin concentration maintained at high level up to 8 days after the onset to prevent false negative result. This observation fits well to data obtained from other virus infections such as HIV [21], [23], Rubella [22], or also Ebola [30] and it agrees with results from, e.g., the experimental infection of rhesus macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [31]. Data available primarily from studies with HIV-1 infection [20], [32] imply that a predictive value of neopterin concentrations might exist also in patients with SARS, those with lower neopterin concentrations being more likely to recover than others. Notably, behavior of neopterin concentrations in acute SARS patients is similar to cytomegalovirus (CMV) or rubella infection [15], [22] but differs considerably from patients with HIV-1 or animals with SIV infection [21], [23], [31]: like in SARS patients, acute CMV and rubella infection causes a sharp increase of neopterin concentrations which is followed by seroconversion and a drop of neopterin concentrations into the range of healthy controls. By contrast, in the majority of patients with acute HIV-1 infection the drop of neopterin concentrations after seroconversion does not reach the normal range, elevated neopterin concentrations in the subsequent asymptomatic phase indicating continuous presence of virus and its replication albeit at a low level. Thus, normal neopterin concentrations in convalescent SARS patients suggest absence of vial replication.",

This shows that neopterin can be an early indicator of the severity of SARS. The clinical progression of SARS is described as a tri-phasic pattern [2]. Increased neopterin levels of SARS patients in phase I prior to seroconversion indicate increased activity of the cellular immune system, which is primarily due to the effect of viral replication and cytolysis. The symptoms generally improve after a few days. As the disease progresses into phase II, the neopterin levels return to the reference range after seroconversion. The lung damage at this phase is related to immunopathological damage as a result of an exuberant host response, rather than uncontrolled viral replication. Therefore, there was no correlation between neopterin levels and antibody titers. Recurrence of fever, onset of diarrhea, oxygen desaturation, and shifting radiographic shadows occur. Phase III is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating ventilatory support. Patients may develop nosocomial sepsis during this phase of end-organ damage and severe lymphopenia. To minimize both the risk of progression to the chronic phase of ARDS and the side effects of steroid treatment, early assessment of the severity of SARS is critical for the treatment design. Using neopterin to quantify the severity of SARS, patients can receive proper medical treatment at an early stage, thus producing a good recovery rate, contributing considerable economic gains for both patients and hospitals and minimizing the risk of infection transmission.",

This implies that neopterin level may be a useful marker of inflammatory activity in SARS. Proinflammatory cytokines released by stimulated macrophages in the alveoli have a prominent role in pathogenesis of SARS, resulting in cytokine dysregulation [33]. Using steroids in the treatment of SARS patients is to modulate this cytokine response and prevent a fatal outcome. However, steroids may lead to permanent suppression of the cellular immune reactions associated with the T cells and thus to an increased susceptibility to infection by opportunistic germs. By stratifying patients according to the severity of the disease, suitable dosage of steroid can be applied to minimize the major side effects. Interestingly, the use of neopterin monitoring to classify patients for steroid therapy has been already suggested for patients with sarcoidosis [34].",
