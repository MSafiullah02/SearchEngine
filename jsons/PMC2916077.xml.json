            "text": "Enveloped viruses constitute a significant global health problem and potential bioterror hazard. This group of viruses includes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza virus, members of the coronavirus family, and all of the high risk pathogenic viruses, including the arboviruses, filoviruses and poxviruses. All viruses require host cell factors for completion of their life cycle and the identification of these factors presents an opportunity to discover therapeutic targets that in principle should be less susceptible to virus evasion by mutation (Lama and Planelles, 2007). Genome-wide high-throughput screening has emerged as a powerful technique for identifying host factors that regulate virus replication and budding (Brass et al., 2008, Konig et al., 2008, Krishnan et al., 2008, Randall et al., 2007, Tai et al., 2009, Zhou et al., 2008). This is of particular interest with respect to developing effective methods to characterize novel or emerging viruses (Snowden, 2008). Although identification of specific viruses requires at least partial knowledge of the protein or DNA composition of the virus, improvements in sequencing technology have made it possible to discover novel viruses using microarray chips (Wang et al., 2002), cDNA amplification (van der Hoek et al., 2004) or next-generation sequencing methods (Briese et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2006). However, few of these methods are compatible with high-throughput screening approaches.",

Alternatively, reporter virus particles can be produced by translational fusion of a specific virus component to a reporter gene such as chloramphenicol transferase (Sato et al., 1995, Wu et al., 1995, Yao et al., 1999), luciferase (Asokan et al., 2008, Kolokoltsov and Davey, 2004, McCarthy et al., 2006) or alkaline phosphatase (Iro et al., 2009). A similar concept is the incorporation of translational fusions with fluorescent proteins to observe trafficking of individual virions (Fritz et al., 2008, McDonald et al., 2002, Muller et al., 2004). However, in many cases the reporter gene interferes with infectivity of the virus (Furnes et al., 2008, Shih et al., 2004) and careful optimization is required for each individual virus construct. To develop more general labeled-virus assays, the reporter gene should be incorporated by a means common to a large group of viruses.",

It has been proposed that virus budding originates in lipid rafts, and as a consequence lipid raft-localized host cell proteins are highly enriched in viral membranes (Hammarstedt and Garoff, 2004, Hammarstedt et al., 2000, Manes et al., 2000, Ono and Freed, 2001). This property can be used to target enzymatic reporter activities to the virus membrane by modification of the reporter with a lipid raft anchor, a strategy that has previously been used for pseudotyping of virus particles (Pickl et al., 2001). The present report shows that host cells expressing GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase can be used to detect diverse enveloped viruses as RSV, HSV1, HIV and human coronavirus 229E. The method thus allows the detection, isolation and characterization of a wide variety of known enveloped viruses and in principle could be applied to unknown or poorly characterized emerging viruses.",

One of these, placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) fused to CD16b GPI-anchor (AP::CD16b; Fig. 1A) proved suitable for the purpose. AP::CD16b was expressed on the cell surface of cells as shown by flow cytometry analysis using specific antibody against AP (Fig. 1B). Treatment with PI-PLC resulted in a reduction (67.7 \u00b1 11.2%) of the amount of AP::CD16b on the cell surface, confirming that AP::CD16b is anchored by a glycosylphosphatidyl lipid. The release of AP activity into supernatant (SN) upon co-expression of MoMLV Gag-Pol was measured as a surrogate for virus infection. The MoMLV Gag protein has been shown to be sufficient to form virus-like particles in the absence of retroviral RNA or other structural proteins and thus serves as a good model system for membrane incorporation of host proteins (Mergener et al., 1992). In the absence of Gag-Pol, very little AP activity was detected in supernatant (Fig. 1C). In the presence of Gag-Pol, a 4-fold increase in AP activity in supernatant of cells expressing AP::CD16b was detected, indicating specific release of AP activity as a consequence of Gag-Pol expression (Fig. 1C). To determine, whether AP activity was associated with virus-like particles (VLP), AP activity in the soluble (Fig. 1D) and particulate fraction (Fig. 1E) after ultracentrifugation was measured. Very little AP activity was associated with the soluble fraction, while the majority of the activity was recovered in the particulate fraction (Fig. 1D and E). In the presence of Gag-Pol, a 10-fold increase of AP activity in the particulate fraction was detected (Fig. 1E). AP::CD16b was present at similar levels in cell lysates in the presence or absence of Gag-Pol. In contrast, full-length AP::CD16b was detected only in supernatants from cells expressing Gag-Pol, but not control cells (Fig. 1F). We conclude that AP::CD16b is expressed on the surface of virus-like particles and allows monitoring Gag-Pol induced particle formation.",

To determine whether cells had been infected with HCoV 229E, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-HCoV antibody that is highly specific for the 229E sub-type of HCoV, but not for OC43. A single band was detected in infected cells but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 3H). Thus, this system can be used to detect viruses of the coronavirus family in MRC5 cells.",

Successful screening of several viruses for cellular host factors has been reported including HIV (Brass et al., 2008, Konig et al., 2008, Yeung et al., 2009, Zhou et al., 2008), HCV (Lupberger et al., 2008, Randall et al., 2007, Tai et al., 2009), West Nile virus (Krishnan et al., 2008) and Influenza virus (Hao et al., 2008). Targeting host cell factors for antiviral strategies may overcome virus resistance to conventional virus-targeted therapies that arises due to the high mutation rate of the viral genome. It would be interesting to identify host cell factors that are common to different pathogenic viruses, thus enabling \u201cpan\u201d-viral therapeutic targets. However, screening of multiple different viruses is difficult to achieve, largely because individual assays for each virus have to be established and optimized. The development of general virus detection methods would allow cross-virus screening. Prior to our study, a small molecule screen for SARS based on the observation of cytopathic effects was reported (Ivens et al., 2005). In principle, the detection of cytopathic effects is applicable to multiple viruses, but effects on general toxicity need to be controlled for. In addition, quantitation of cytopathic effects is much harder to achieve and less sensitive than enzymatic reporter systems. As such, cytopathic effects are largely a qualitative measure of general cytotoxicity rather than virus infectivity.",

The natural GPI-anchor of placental alkaline phosphatase incorporates effectively into the membrane of diverse enveloped virus particles. Other anchor sequences such as the extracellular domain of the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor that has been used to funtionalize lentiviral particles (Nesbeth et al., 2006) may be used as alternative targeting motif. Several studies have demonstrated that the incorporation of reporter enzymes in the virus genome impacts budding and infectivity of the virus. The system described here is based on expression of the reporter in trans, thus enabling the detection of multiple viruses. The impact on budding, viral yields, potency and the immune profile when expressed in cis need to be addressed separately in future studies as these would be important aspects to address the suitability of this system for gene delivery and gene therapy approaches. Since the system described here does not modify integral virus components, but rather decorates the virus particle with the reporter enzyme, it has potentially a minimal effect on the virus structure itself. This is underscored by the demonstration that infectious HIV particles can be obtained by immuno-capture using anti-Flag antibodies.",

Second, the assay is amenable to high-throughput screening and can be used for multiple enveloped viruses. Third, a magnetic purification scheme is described that enables the recovery of infectious virus for further analysis. Thus, this system enables detection and subsequent analysis of enveloped viruses without prior reference to their composition. One limitation of this system is cell culture adaptation as a pre-requisite for virus screening. Vero cells have proven as suitable host for multiple cell culture adapted viruses, but may not be suitable for all enveloped viruses. In such cases, the use of alternate hosts such as MRC5 or MDCK cells can be explored. We propose that this tool will be highly useful as a research tool for characterization of known and novel enveloped viruses.",
