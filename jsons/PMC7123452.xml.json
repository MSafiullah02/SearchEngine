In addition, governments and political leaders are no different; they too pursue this illustrious goal through laws, policies, and organizations. Look at most political elections \u2013 some of the main reasons the electorate vote for a certain candidate is their belief that the candidate will be able to make an economy free of turmoil or a nation safe from large-scale disasters domestically and internationally. However, whereas most people try to be proactive in preventing disaster from touching their lives, governments have been historically reactionary when it comes to disaster management response. Jeong, Yak-yong, a renowned Korean scholar and government official in the late Joseon Dynasty, said, \u201cAlways prepare for disaster because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d This notion is wise and poignant; however, it seems difficult to follow as society is becoming more complex, interconnected, and ripe for new types of disasters with intricate and devastating ripple effect. We can see this in five disaster events that have taken place recently: the 2003 Daegu Subway fire in the Republic of Korea, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in Japan, the 2015 Tianjin explosions in China, the Ebola virus, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that has infected people around the globe. Each of these events exposed their respective governments to their ill preparedness to catastrophic events.",

The 2003 Daegu Subway fire in the Republic of Korea was a human-triggered disaster caused by one person\u2019s angst against society in combination with poor staff education and training dealing with subway accidents and a poor safety culture that left passengers too powerless and untrained to use emergency exits. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and the following Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident in Japan, was a \u201csupercomplexed\u201d disaster in combination with a natural disaster that triggered a technological disaster.",

The 2015 Tianjin explosions in China were an increasing disaster risk combined with industrialization and a concentration of high-risk facilities, which falls within Normal Accident Theory. And, the Ebola virus and the MERS-CoV are newly emerging disasters triggered by interconnectivity of the world, making local infections easily transmittable to other countries and insufficient information sharing among countries, such as a lack of sharing of medical status of symptoms. From 1976 to 2013, the Ebola virus that struck sub-Saharan Africa occurred mainly in isolated villages and killed all inflicted people so it was rarely transmitted to the outside world. However, after a significant increase of activity between the United States (USA), Europe, and Africa, the Ebola virus that stuck West Africa in 2014 was easily transmitted from its origin source to Europe and the USA. MERS-CoV, in 2012, was also easily transmitted outside of its origin source in Saudi Arabia to the rest of the world through greater interconnectivity.",

In ancient times, people mainly understood major disasters as God\u2019s punishment and placated them through rituals and prayers. After the 1790 Lisbon earthquake, scholars tried to understand what constituted disaster, called hazard, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, and a volcanic activity. Leaders used this knowledge to start developing policies and laws to reduce risk due to hazard. In modern times, we have tried to understand vulnerability that is interrelated with social structure, such as population density, patterns of urbanization and industrialization, and social inequality. Through planning, understanding risk, developing disaster mitigation plans, education and training programs, and so forth, modern scholars and leaders strive to push hazard and vulnerability as far away from society as possible.",

            "text": "Currently, Complexity Theory is coming to the forefront of explaining the characteristics of disasters. Complexity Theory, which began from research on complex natural phenomena such as meteorology, has been recently applied to the characteristics of disaster as recent disasters have been triggered by various and complex causes. Pelling (2003) argued that Complexity Theory possesses a very important lesson to understanding ways to respond to disasters. For example, one of the characteristics of Complexity Theory is emergence, and it shows a trait of disasters that take place with unexpected causes at an unexpected place. In addition, studies by various scholars, such as Barton et al. (1994), Becerra et al. (2006), Janczura and Weron (2012), and Jo and Ko (2014), indicate that the relation between event frequency and its magnitude regarding earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods follows the power law, which is one of the characteristics of a complex system. However, most previous studies on disaster and complexity have been limited by focusing on specific types of disaster. To understand the characteristics of disaster in a country, additional and comprehensive analysis about the characteristics of all types of disasters that have occurred in that nation needs to be scrutinized using comprehensive data sets of natural and social disasters. The power law has a significant implication for enhancing disaster risk management in that long-tailed distributed events in the power law function will have a severe impact on social systems due to damage beyond acceptable and comprehensible levels even though the events are infrequent. Birkland (1997) noted that these events, labeled as \u201cfocusing event,\u201d could provide a window of opportunity for policy change by concentrating the attention of various organizations, government officials, and media. However, there has been little research done on the dynamics of policy change after a focusing event irrespective of its benefit and advantage, which is one of the reasons we decided to focus our attention on this monumentally missed opportunity, an opportunity to help people and society become safer and happier.",

In the twenty-first century, disaster risk in Korea is increasing due to the emergence of new types of sudden disasters, such as MERS-CoV, the increase of complex disasters, and the heightened probability of a slow onset severe drought interwoven with climate change. However, research on disasters in Korea has been limited by focusing on the effect of a single disaster, finding the cause of a disaster, or making policy recommendations based on a study of other nations\u2019 disaster management systems. To remedy this, it is essential, for the future development of an effective disaster response policy, to understand the characteristic of power-law distributed disasters and to analyze the dynamics of various elements, such as political will and media, on policy change in the wake of focusing events. Therefore, research needs to be conducted and focused on the dynamics of disaster response policy change and power-law distribution in Korea.",

The initial awareness of disaster management began in AD 6, when the Roman emperor Augustus organized a professional fire brigade as well as vigilantes to monitor different areas of Rome. The 1000 strong vigilantes were responsible for seven quadrants of the city, being placed in seven groups to handle the 14 administrative districts of Rome. These seven groups were responsible for preventing, monitoring, and extinguishing threatening fires within their designated area of responsibility. In AD 64, a massive conflagration broke out \u2013 known later as The Great Fire of Rome. In the wake of the disaster, the ruling emperor, Nero, instituted a series of building codes to prevent the recurrence of disastrous fires, which included the use of geometric architectural forms and open spaces to prevent the rapid spread of a fire, if one broke out again. Additionally, he further introduced several systematic disaster management measures to handle a fire as well as the masses trying to flee it. Some of these measures were water nods, built around the city to secure supplies of water for the fire brigades; dedicated people, appointed to manage water supplies; and fire shelters, created as a safe haven for the masses to escape an inferno.",

According to the Samguk Sagi Vol. 34, a royal palace was established in the 21st year of Hyeokkeose and was named Golden Palace. Thus, it can be inferred that the south gate of Golden Palace, which was a palace in the early Silla period, was collapsed because of an earthquake. The third and fourth most recorded disasters were cold-weather damage due to frost and hail, with 24 records, and flood with 23 records. Severe floods took place mostly in April and July by the lunar calendar, and there were two major floods in April and July in the 5th year of Soji of Silla (AD 482).

Earthshocks, landslide, heavy snowfall, fire and smallpox are disasters further recorded in the era. Also, there was damage from a gale-force wind (the Korean word \u201cdaepoong\u201d).1\n",

For example, there were records of a ritual for rain after an extended period of drought \u2013 the king would hold a memorial service as a priest \u2013 as an effort to minimize damage when droughts continued. Samguk Sagi recorded seven rituals for rain in Silla, four in Baekje, and one in Goguryeo.

Efforts by the government to create small and large reservoirs for irrigation and to minimize damage from disaster in each town were partly registered in Samguk Sagi. At this time, one of the representative reservoirs was the Byeokgolje Reservoir Site in the Baekje period, and its embankment remains from Pogyo-li to Walsong-li in Buryang-myun, Kimje-si, Jeollabuk-do. The Byeokgolje Reservoir Site is the largest reservoir among ancient reservoirs that remain until now and was created in the 27th year of King Biryu (AD 330) who was the 11th king of Baekje.

Research into earthquakes using scientific methods began in earnest, and preparations for future disasters began to be codified and implemented into construction, public works, and city planning. Hereby, people began to move away from the traditional God-centered disaster management theory.

Those events, which almost completely destroyed Messina, are recorded as one of the biggest natural catastrophes that had occurred in Europe until that time.

For the reconstruction of the city, the USA, together with several European countries including Russian Federation (Russia), United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK), and France, assisted in the recovery efforts after the great disaster. The 1908 earthquake spurred the adoption of the first seismic design regulations in Italy in 1909, which were issued by Royal Decree.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the former part of Joseon Dynasty suffered from drought and flood damage every year. The fact that such disasters took place every year in the Joseon society, where agriculture was the basis of the state, shows that those disasters affected not only the daily lives of the people but also the political stability of the Dynasty. Droughts were concentrated in the regions such as Youngseo in Gangwon province, the northwest of Hwanghae province, the southwest coast of Pyungahn province, and eastern Kyungsang province.

Thus, the Joseon Dynasty took practical and concrete measures against disasters, such as drought and flood that could hugely impact agriculture production, and put efforts to improve the disaster management system. First, the measures were concentrated on irrigation facilities because they were essential in solving the agriculture-related problems caused by the shortage or the excess of water. Irrigation facilities of the Joseon Dynasty include a bank that was to block valleys with dikes and irrigate water with a water gate. Blocking water is to build banks to block seawater, and irrigation facilities to draw water for irrigation water called a river port are the major irrigation facilities. Representative irrigation facilities of the Joseon Dynasty are threefold: the Korean word \u201cJe\u201d that was to block valleys with dikes that incorporated a water gate, the Korean word \u201cEon\u201d that was to build bank to block seawater, and the Korean word \u201cBo\u201d that was to draw water from a river for irrigation.",

Also in the ninth year of King Taejong, Woo Hee-yeol, governor of Wojnu, handed in public appeals to build Je-Eon, and he argued that Je-Eon was very important for preparing for or preventing drought, and there was a need to establish a government agency for the tasks (The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, King Taejong Vol. 17).",

In time, it repaired the Byeokgolje Reservoir Site in Kimje, the Nulje reservoir in Gobu, and the Sutong reservoir in Bupyung and created the Gareungpodaeje reservoir in Ganghwa. Such irrigation facilities were mainly about repairing or creating reservoirs on a large sale in the early period, and to correspond to the needs of farmers for small reservoir sites was also secured. Also in 1679, the fifth year of King Sookjong, Hojo\u2019s minister Oh Jung-wui suggested a department of embankment (The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, King Sookjong Vol. 8). As a result, a regular department of embankment called the \u201cJe-Eon Sa\u201d was established to control and coordinate regional offices' management of irrigation facilities. Secondly, within the expansion of irrigation facilities, the Joseon government practiced religious ceremonies such as rituals for rain, gicheongje,10 and worship at noted mountains and large rivers; at Jongmyo, a royal ancestral shrine; and at Sajik, an altar where ritual ceremonies were performed for the purpose of overcoming drought and flood damage altogether. Such method was transcended from the ancient times with an idea that disaster is the punishment by the heavens. Thirdly, in the Joseon Dynasty when Confucianism was accepted, the king himself responded to disaster as a way to become a virtuous man to win respect and take the lead service. That is, several policies were initiated such as asking for measures to overcome disaster to retainers; banning construction practices such as duty work, tribute, and donation; banning military training; avoiding power cuts which is to avoid activities in the midst of power outage; and reducing number of food and personnel affairs such as resignation according to a degree of damage from disaster. These indicate a will to overcome natural disasters with the royal regime instead of heavenly mandates such as ritual for rain that was mentioned in the second point (NEMA 2005). During the reign of Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty, instruments for astronomical observations like a rain gauge were invented along with the development of astronomy; various astronomical books and charts were studied and published. In that period, knowledge for agriculture, such as an almanac, the 24 divisions of the year, and chronemics, was considered as the basic of Imperial politics. Therefore, kings in the early Joseon Dynasty invested in astronomical phenomena, namely, the world of the sun, the moon, and the stars. Also, they were considered one of national supreme studies as the movements of heavenly bodies were connected to the livings of human. The study of astronomy is vital not only for the dignity of King but also for the stability of agriculture-based economies and the enrichment of the people.",

Since the nineteenth century, many countries had started to develop national relief systems, which laid the foundation of the establishment of specialized organizations on disaster management and the development of disaster insurance systems. From the mid-twentieth century, comprehensive research started on the vulnerability of society as well as natural phenomena like typhoon and earthquake.",

The development of science and technology and an increased interest in human society has made disaster shift from God\u2019s domain to natural and social science areas. In addition, increased citizenry rights made governments become actively engaged in disaster management.",

When disasters take place, a perspective to interpret disasters as Gods\u2019 act was dominant in the ancient world, and this belief became weaker in modern society. Although some cases that still view disaster as a supernatural phenomenon from a religious point of view can be found even in contemporary societies, disaster response ways have evolved through more comprehensive and systematic understanding of hazard, vulnerability, and the characteristics of the contemporary society in the wake of triggering events, such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.",
