            "text": "The use of a next-generation sequencing approaches in RNA sequencing has facilitated understanding and defining the expression profiles of cellular responses during pathogen infection. This method has been proven to be helpful in explaining the pathogenesis of various viruses [1, 2], including Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) [3, 4]. Furthermore, the increasing availability of complete genome sequences for a number of model organisms makes host transcriptome analysis a valuable tool for elucidating mechanisms of virus pathogenesis and host responses to virus infection. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is thought to be the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Understanding the molecular basis of FIPV pathogenesis will provide valuable information to devise effective treatments and formulate vaccines with higher efficacy. Once established, focus can be directed at disrupting the virulent determinants or formulating new vaccine or even designing gene therapy treatment. Facilitating this, the complete 1.9X cat genome, using the Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) approach, provides valuable information for bioinformatics analysis of feline host responses following pathogen infection. Moreover, the cat genome contigs were aligned, mapped, and annotated to NCBI annotated genome sequences of six index mammalian genomes (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog and cow) using MegaBLAST [5]. In this chapter we describe a pipeline for transcriptome analysis using FIPV infection of feline cells in culture as an example. Specifically, mRNA harvested from CRFK cells 3 h post infection with FIPV strain 79-1146 were sequenced using Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. The generated data was then analyzed using CLC bio Genomic Workbench, where the genes were compared to Felis catus 1.9X annotated shotgun reference genome. Kal\u2019s Z-test on expression proportions [6] was used to determine significantly expressed genes. Genes expressed with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05 and >1.99- and <-1.99-fold change were considered for further analysis.",

Absence of one or both of the ribosomal peaks indicates poor sample preparation or poor sample pipetting technique. The second feature of a successful run is a complete ladder electropherogram. A complete ladder electropherogram must feature one marker peak and six RNA peaks where all seven peaks are well resolved.Adapters used by common high-throughput sequencing vendors such as Illumina and SOLiD were predefined and are available by the software. Removing the adapters will increase the specificity of the raw sequence reducing false match.Perform expression analysis based on the method described by Mortazavi et al. in 2008 [7] and CLC bio manual, CLC bio tutorials and recommendations from CLC bio support services.In short, high quality trim value allowed low quality base or base with low Phred quality score to be included in the sequence. The ambiguity trimming trims the sequence ends based on the presence of ambiguous nucleotides usually denoted as N making the sequence more specific.\nOther Bioinformatics analysis: A gene in eukaryotic organism is commonly regulated by other genes and proteins in its system. The interactions among genes expressed and between gene expressed and other genes can be elucidated by means of computer or in silico analysis. In silico analysis, a part of bioinformatics analysis, able to do this by integrating data with available data on bioinformatics databases. Such integration will allow a researcher to make accurate predictions and designing experiments to test the hypothesis. The main objective of in silico analysis is gene ontology which is defined as the process of elucidating associated pathways, molecular function, biological process, cellular components and protein products of a gene [8].The bioinformatics database used to analyze gene identity and gene interaction is Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships Classification System or in short known as PANTHER (http://www.pantherdb.org/). It is a unique resource that classifies genes by their functions, using published scientific experimental evidence and evolutionary relationships to predict function even in the absence of direct experimental evidence and is a part of the Gene Ontology Reference Genome Project (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.refgenome.shtml#curation).PANTHER provides tools for gene expression analysis for data interpretation (http://www.pantherdb.org/tools/genexAnalysis.jsp). Multiple gene lists will be mapped to PANTHER molecular function, biological process, and cellular component categories as well as to biological pathways. The gene expression data interpretation is conducted by comparing genes in a given list and statistically compares the list to the reference list to look for under and over represented functional categories. The step-by-step method and the statistical test employed are described in detail at http://www.pantherdb.org/tips/tips_binomial.jsp. For the statistical analysis, a cutoff of less than 0.05 is selected as significant p-value.\n",
