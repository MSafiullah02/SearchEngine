However, over the last decade, the role of viruses in outbreaks associated with foodborne illness has increased such that together, they represent a significant threat to global public health (FAO/WHO 2008). Moreover, there continues to be an ever growing list of emerging viral pathogens that could threaten the food supply. These include such well-known agents as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and avian influenza, as well as the lesser known Aichi and Nipah viruses.\n",

Most foodborne illnesses are either underreported or not reported at all leaving many gaps in our understanding of the impact of viruses in food (Fischer Walker et al. 2010; Mead et al. 1999; Newell et al. 2010). A large percentage of documented viral foodborne outbreaks are not associated with retail, but rather through away from home establishments (Matthews et al. 2012) such as restaurants, cruise ships, and healthcare facilities. Of those that do occur at home, outbreaks may be due not to the nature of the food at purchase, but as a result of contamination of the food source after the product has been purchased (Fein et al. 2011; Henley et al. 2012; Hoelzl et al. 2013). These factors in food safety suggest the current methods of microbiological control, which mainly are based on coliform bacterial identification and enumeration to assess fecal contamination, may not be sufficient.",

A recent survey of foodborne outbreaks in the USA revealed that regardless of the means of spread, over 40 % of the recorded outbreaks were due to virus infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). Globally, estimates suggest that viruses may account for between 8 and 68 % of the total number of foodborne infections (FAO/WHO 2008). A significant proportion of these cases are due to the continuing increase in food importation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013; FAO Trade and Markets Division 2012). Many of these countries do not have the capacity to incorporate food safety practices including hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP), good hygiene practices (GHP), and adherence to the standards of the Codex Alimentarius, in particular, Guidelines for the Validation of Food Safety Control Measures (Codex Alimentarius 2008). Yet, imported foods are actively sought by an increasing exotic appetite in the developed world. Without proper surveillance activity, many viral agents can move freely across borders without detection (Buisson et al. 2008; Jebara 2004).",

Most documented cases are respiratory in nature, however, two particular strains, Ad40 and Ad41 have been implicated in gastroenteritis and foodborne transmission in many areas of the globe (Ahluwalia et al. 1994; Aminu et al. 2007; Brown 1990; Bryden et al. 1997; Dey et al. 2009; Grimwood et al. 1995; Herrmann et al. 1988; Johansson et al. 1994; Saderi et al. 2002; Shinozaki et al. 1991a; Tiemessen et al. 1989) particularly in children under 2 years of age (Shinozaki et al. 1991b; Uhnoo et al. 1984). The main source of these viruses is unsafe water, which can either contaminate fish or produce through irrigation. For example, Hansman et al. (2008) identified that 52 % of 33 packages of clams collected from Japanese markets were positive for adenoviruses. Similarly, Cheong et al. (2009) found the presence of adenoviruses on spinach, lettuce, and chicory; a result of irrigation with unsafe water. Based on laboratory studies of the persistence of these viruses on foods, there was no significant loss of infectivity after 1 week (Verhaelen et al. 2012). A similar study by Diez-Valcarce et al. (2012) showed that 36 % of the mussels sampled from three European countries had the presence of the gastrointestinal adenoviruses.",

The virus has been implicated in an outbreak associated with the consumption of oysters (Le Guyader et al. 2008) and has been linked to other incidences of gastroenteritis (Oh et al. 2006), although the food source was not determined. The virus is stable on produce (Fino and Kniel 2008a) and in shellfish (Sdiri-Loulizi et al. 2010).",

The predominant route of infection is water (Abad et al. 1997) and the virus can persist on fomites for several days (Abad et al. 2001), suggesting that foodborne infections are due to improper food handling.

The virus is abundant worldwide and present in many regions of the world including developed countries such as Italy (Campagna et al. 2012) and The Netherlands (Whelan et al. 2013). Studies in the laboratory have shown that HAV is highly stable in the environment (Siegl et al. 1984) and can easily be found in shellfish growing in contaminated waters (Diez-Valcarce et al. 2012). In agricultural settings, the virus can be internalized into produce such as spinach (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013), tomatoes (Carvalho et al. 2012), and strawberries (Niu et al. 1992). While there is ample evidence to suggest that the virus can easily be involved in retail as a result of improper food processing (Wang et al. 2013), there is also significant evidence showing that the virus can also be transferred through food handling (Tricco et al. 2006). The virus can transfer easily through environmental surfaces, known as fomites (Abad et al. 1994) including knives and graters (Wang et al. 2013), and can remain infective for several hours in acidic conditions (Scholz et al. 1989).",

Transmission is generally mediated through water, however, foodborne outbreaks have occurred, primarily through the ingestion of improperly cooked meat products including swine, boar, poultry, venison, ovine, and beef products (Meng 2011). HEV has also been found in shellfish (Koizumi et al. 2004; Song et al. 2010), in pig livers (Berto et al. 2012; Bouwknegt et al. 2007), and in agricultural produce (Ceylan et al. 2003), but the risk associated with these two routes is significantly smaller than that of livestock and game meats.",

The viruses were first discovered in 1972 (Kapikian et al. 1972) in an isolated case of pediatric diarrhea. Over the three decades that followed, the noroviruses were found to be globally abundant and identified as the cause of winter vomiting disease, stomach flu, and cruise ship illness. There have been over 900 documented cases of norovirus foodborne outbreaks (Matthews et al. 2012), many of which were determined to be due to retail and RTE purchases.",

In contrast, nonenveloped viruses have an external protein shell that can resist environmental stressors and many disinfectants (Maillard and Russell 1997; Sattar et al. 1989). In the context of foodborne viruses, the major contributors to infection, i.e., the astroviruses, Aichi virus, caliciviruses, HAV, and HEV, are all small and nonenveloped. The adenoviruses are also nonenveloped although somewhat larger in size, meaning controlling them may be somewhat easier (Maillard and Russell 1997).

These data correlate well with the fact that foodborne infections due to rotavirus are limited to shellfish and raw produce irrigated with water from unsafe sources (Brassard et al. 2012; Le Guyader et al. 2008; Mattison et al. 2010; Vilarino et al. 2009). In contrast, the nonenveloped viruses can survive and spread throughout the entire food continuum from processing (Baert et al. 2008; Van Boxstael et al. 2013) to storage (Brandsma et al. 2012; Butot et al. 2008; Shieh et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2012; Verhaelen et al. 2012). Moreover, these viruses are well adapted to survive on hands (Greig et al. 2007; Richards 2001; Todd et al. 2009), increasing the potential for contamination both in processing as well as in preparation (Mokhtari and Jaykus 2009).",

While diagnostic tests continue to improve, there continues to be a large variation in testing results. The reasons for this have been excellently reviewed by Stals et al. (2012). In addition, while the detection of viruses in different food sources continues to improve, the applicability of these diagnostic tests has been less than favorable. All the viruses identified in these priority areas have relatively low dose responses and thus require a very low detection limit. This requires highly sensitive methods such as the diagnostic tool, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which identifies the genetic material of a virus, and the more recently developed lab on a chip, in which not only the genetic material but other pieces of the virus including proteins can be detected (Yoon and Kim 2012). However, these are hindered by the requirement for a large sample size to best assess a food source. This challenge has yet to be overcome.",

One study revealed that norovirus can reach as high as 1010 virus particles per gram of fecal matter (Atmar et al. 2008) while symptoms are being experienced. Lower levels can be found even before symptoms have begun (Gaulin et al. 1999) and for several weeks after symptoms have subsided (Gallimore et al. 2004). With the infectious dose of this particular virus being less than 100 particles (Teunis et al. 2008), the chance for contamination leading to infection is particularly high. Yet the most likely chance for contamination in this case occurs at the foodhandling stage, which is the last step before food products are provided to the consumer. As Michaels et al. (2004) and Mokhtari and Jaykus (2009) have both shown, food handlers represent the most likely reservoir leading to high levels of viral contamination and subsequent infections to the consumer.",

For example, the increase in HEV infections has been directly attributed to the zoonotic potential of the virus from swine (Banks et al. 2010; Berto et al. 2012; Bouwknegt et al. 2007; Casas et al. 2011; Di Bartolo et al. 2008; Fu et al. 2010; Leblanc et al. 2010; Pavio et al. 2010; Scobie and Dalton 2013). The presence of the virus not only in the liver of swine, but also their feces, suggests that this particular virus could cause infection either through the traditional fecal\u2013oral route or through the bloodborne route during processing. In contrast, within the context of the viruses identified by the FAO/WHO, there is little evidence to demonstrate the likelihood of HAV or rotavirus infection through a zoonotic route. Additionally, the noroviruses have shown potential, albeit no confirmed zoonotic route has been documented. Surveillance for noroviruses in animals has revealed that they can harbor human noroviruses (Mathijs et al. 2012; Mattison et al. 2007) and that without proper handling of animals could lead to transmission of the virus to humans, particularly farmers and food workers. Interestingly, Summa et al. (2012) have suggested that pet dogs may also serve as a route for infection. While this may not pose a risk for food processing, at the food handling level, where pets may be a part of a food service complement, a potential risk could be implied.",

Yet the use of hand hygiene measures at all stages of the food continuum continues to be an issue, particularly with compliance (Hoelzl et al. 2013; Strohbehn et al. 2004; Todd et al. 2010a). In 2008, for example, Strohbehn et al. (2008) conducted an assessment of foodservice workers in restaurants, childcare institutions, and facilities providing assisted living for the elderly and schools. In comparison to the Food Code requirements of handwashing, which ranged from 7 to 29 handwashing moments per hour, the results were disappointing. In the context of providing RTE foods, this result suggests that there is a significant risk posed to the consumer. Similar results have been seen in other retail markets such as butcheries, supermarkets, and delis (Tebbutt 2007).",

Reasons for these poor results have been investigated (Green et al. 2005, 2006, 2007; Pragle et al. 2007) and a combination of factors including high workload, inappropriate staffing, lack of managerial support, and personal beliefs have been identified.

In a more comprehensive study, Tuladhar et al. (2012) investigated the thermal stability of viruses by measuring the time required to inactivate by 1 log10 (90 %). The results showed that 53 \u00b0C is inadequate to attain proper food safety for adenovirus, poliovirus, MNV, and adenovirus; the time required was well over 5 min and as long as 15 min for MNV-1. The results were significantly improved at 73 \u00b0C, with the required reduction being achieved in less than 2 min. Bertrand et al. (2012) reviewed the available literature and found similar observations for HAV and astroviruses. The data clearly show that higher temperatures than those used for bacteria are required to attain proper inactivation of viruses.

Studies investigating the use of nonresidual disinfectants have been undertaken to reduce the levels of viruses on the surfaces of foods and also in waters used in the food continuum. Kahler et al.

In a similar manner, Su and D\u2019Souza (2011) investigated the use of water containing 5 % trisodium phosphate (which has a similar activity to hypochlorite) on produce. They found the solution was sufficient to inactivate over 7 log10 of MNV after rinsing for 30 s. Fraisse et al.

HPP has the ability to reduce the viral load of foods, including complex matrices, while maintaining food quality (Kingsley et al. 2004, 2013). Kingsley has reviewed the literature on the use of HPP and found that all but the Aichi viruses may be inactivated in 5 min by pressures ranging from 400 to 500 MPa (Kingsley 2013). However, there has yet to be a fully standardized protocol associated with HPP to ensure proper activity against all viruses. Upon finding a harmonized and standard protocol, HPP may see a rise in its use.",

UV light has been known for over a decade to inactivate foodborne viruses (Nuanualsuwan et al. 2002) at levels over 0.1 J/cm2. Fino and Kniel (2008b) found that UV light at a concentration of 0.24 J/cm2 was effective at inactivating over 99 % of HAV, Aichi virus, and the human norovirus surrogate feline calicivirus (FCV) on experimentally contaminated lettuce and onions. The use of UV was not, however, applicable to strawberries due to shielding of the virus in the seed pockets as well as the three-dimensional nature of the surface allowing shadowing. Jean et al. (2011) investigated the use of pulsed-UV light to reduce MNV and HAV on inanimate surfaces. When exposed alone, a 2 s burst consisting of 1.27 J/cm2 overall was enough to inactivate over 99 % of virus. However, when a complex mixture was used (comprising of 5 % fetal bovine serum), that level was reduced significantly. Thus, this method would likely be sufficient when surfaces are cleaned on a regular basis.",

However, gamma irradiation is far less effective against foodborne viruses. At 4 kGy, Feng et al. (2011) have shown that inactivation of MNV is not sufficient to reduce the virus by more than 3 log10 on the surface of various produce. In a similar experiment, Espinosa et al. (2012) showed that 4 kGy was somewhat effective at reducing the levels of poliovirus by at least 1.5 log10 and satisfactory against rotavirus at levels of 3 log10. While there is significant promise for the use of irradiation, both the cost and the requirement for highly trained personnel suggest that this method is not applicable for retail but may be used in prior steps to ensure food safety.",
