A determinant factor in the pathology of the angiostrongilosis seems to be related to the location of the parasite in the host. Their presence inside the arteries and ramifications, promoting a mechanical and/or metabolic action on the wall of the vessels, may alter the hemostatic pathway, being able to induce to a coagulopathy of intravascular consumption, and changes in the hematological profile. Experimental studies suggest that infection with parasites, causes thrombocitopenia and changes of the coagulation profile developed subsequent to 6 weeks and paralleled the apparent host inflammatory response to the parasite (Schelling et al., 1986).",

All the dogs were treated with anti-helminthic drug in two doses (nitroscanate, 50 mg/kg). Additional exams were performed from 7-day intervals to confirm that animals remained free of parasites. All of the dogs were immunized against parvovirus, coronavirus and distemper virus, in three doses at 1 month interval. The dogs were divided according to their weight in three groups of five animals. Groups A and B were inoculated, by oral route, with 50 and 100 infective larvae/kg of body weight, respectively. Group C was not inoculated and provided a control for the experiment. The third stage infective larvae (L3) were obtained by experimental infection of aquatic snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, maintained in laboratory, with 400 larvae of first stage/snails. After 25 days after inoculation (dai), feces were collected daily and examined by Baermann method to determine the prepatent period.",

Red and white blood cell counts were also processed in an automatic cell counter (CELM CC510). The remaining 5 ml of citrated whole blood, was centrifuged at 100g during 5 min to obtain the plasma rich in platelets (PRP) and, afterwards, at 500g for 10 min obtaining the plasma poor in platelets (PPP). The PPP was used for prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and of V and VIII clot factors measurements, while the PRP was used for platelet aggregation test in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was employed as an agonist. In the coagulation evaluation, PT and PTT were assessed by using calcic thromboplastin (Pacific HemosthasisR-ThromboScreenR) and cephalin containing celite as an activator (Biolab, Merieux), respectively, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

With regard to the differential leukocyte count, the kinetic of the immature and segmented neutrophils presented inverse profile on the 45 dai, suggesting migration of the segmented neutrophils to the tissues and a rapid release of immature neutrophils to the peripheral blood. Neutrophils that have migrated into tissue do not return to the bloodstream, normally, they migrate into the lung, gastrointestinal tract, liver and spleen (Osgood, 1954). Since A. vasorum is known to have a pulmonary phase and this may cause an inflammatory process in the lungs. Neutrophils are attracted to the tissues in response to stimuli from inflamed area and may secrete cytokynes that further influence the number of these cells in the bloodstream, as well as the release of immature neutrophils. Traumatic injury produced by adult worms, causing tissue necrosis, larvae elimination and migration, would justify the mobilization of immature neutrophils from bone marrow to the bloodstream and subsequently to the tissues. It is possible that constituents of tissue necrosis may result in enhanced cytokynes production by lymphocytes that promote myelopoiesis (Nimer and Goldi, 1995).",

            "text": "Eosinophils are present in the blood and some tissues, predominantly the skin, lungs, intestines and genitourinary tract. They migrate from bone marrow to peripheral blood, both in marginal pools and the circulation, as well as to the tissues. Eosinophils levels depend on the activity of different eosinophilopoietic factors and the contributions of margination and recirculation. The most common causes of blood and tissue eosinophilia are hypersensibility reactions and parasite infection. It is known that acute pulmonary eosinophilic infiltrates with blood eosinophilia may be caused by immune reactions to antigens localized in the lungs including drugs and parasites, frequently (Galli and Goetzl, 1995). Based on the host/parasite interaction, it is possible that the peaks in four periods, observed for eosinophils in the present work (on 10, 20, 72 and 160 dai) to be associated to the maturation of the L3 larvae to the early L5 stage within mesenteric lymph nodes and subsequent migration of the latter via the hepatic portal system to the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries during the initial periods of infection. During the growing of adults worms and patency, immunogenic particles released from the parasites may produce eosinophilia by multiple interactions involving macrophages and lymphocytes. These results are similar to those of Mishra and Cens (1971), who observed peaks, associated the with infective larvae migration, growing of the adults worms and patency. Eosinophils alterations were reported by Rosen et al. (1970), Bwangamoi (1972), Perry et al. (1991), however, Prestwood et al. (1981) and Cury (1995) did not find any consistent hematological abnormalities in dogs infected experimentally with A. vasorum.",

Due to the possible presence of vascular lesion, which would be caused by parasites and/or antigen\u2013antibody complexes deposition, a greater afflux of platelets to the area could happen resulting in the reduction of the number of circulating platelets. The lower number of platelets resulted in a decreased platelet aggregation.

However, they agreed with respect to the moment when the alterations arise, suggesting a role for larval migration in the development of the coagulopathy of consumption. Although elevated plasma levels of factor VIII are found in inflammatory processes. However, the coagulopathy of consumption would justify the lower factor VIII levels found in this study.
