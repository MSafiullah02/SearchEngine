Eligible households were identified by computers, whereas ineligible telephone numbers such as fax numbers and commercial telephone numbers were automatically screened out. Inclusion criteria were being able to communicate in Korean and capable of answering a telephone interview. Within each eligible household, 1 adult aged 18 years or older whose birthday was closest to the survey date was invited to participate in the study. Unanswered household telephone numbers were called at different times and days for up to 4 times before replacement with new numbers. More than 70% of the calls were made after 6:00 p.m. to avoid oversampling of the nonworking population. Respondents agreeing to participate completed a telephone interview based on a standardized questionnaire.",

Internal consistency (Cronbach's a) for the above core measures was generally acceptable ranging from 0.61 (for perceived social norms in MERS prevention) to 0.90 (for perceived susceptibility to MERS and worry about MERS) (Table 1\n). The items used to assess each core measure are detailed in Appendix Table S1. Mean scores and/or proportions of risk perception variables and attitudes toward quarantine were calculated and their variability by age, gender, and educational attainment was assessed using multivariate logistic/linear regression models.",

In such circumstances, trust in the government is likely to plunge as initial confusion about sources of infection and efforts to understand and control outbreaks sees numbers of cases rocket.9 Distrust was perhaps amplified by government's initial attempt to withhold the names of hospitals involved in treating the first batch of infected patients, which were the main sources of subsequent infection, particularly among higher-educated and younger people who may easily access information from other sources, such as the Internet.",
