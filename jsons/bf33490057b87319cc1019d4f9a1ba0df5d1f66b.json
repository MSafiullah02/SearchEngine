The adult stage of the beetle is an extremely important pest when manure is spread on \u00deelds during warmer months. The adult is capable of \u00dfight and will move en masse toward arti\u00decial lights generated by residences near \u00deelds on which beetle-infested manure has been spread (Axtell 1999) . This behavior has resulted in poor community relations and may result in very costly litigation.
