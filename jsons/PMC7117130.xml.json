PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 25-kb in length (Zhang, 2016). Compare to the complete genome of another two common swine enteropathogenic coronaviruses (PEDV, TGEV), the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain (GenBank no: MF280390) shares 43.39%, 42.79% nucleotide identity with PEDV GDS01 (GenBank no: KM089829.1) and TGEV AHHF (GenBank no: KX499468.1), respectively. Since it was first detected in 2012 in Hong Kong during a molecular epidemiology study of CoVs (Woo et al., 2012), PDCoV subsequently had been reported in at least 9 states of the United States, Thailand, Vietnam, Lao PDR, South Korea, Canada, and mainland China (Leyi et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017; Sunhee Lee, 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2018). These molecular surveillance studies indicated that PDCoV was a common viral pathogen of pigs around the world.",

Currently a few studies have reproduced clinical diarrheal disease by experimentally infecting gnotobiotic and conventional pigs with the isolated PDCoV strains (Chen et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Kwonil et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018). As expected, the 11\u201314 day-old gnotobiotic pigs inoculated orally with PDCoV strain OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 showed severe diarrhea, vomiting, and atrophic enteritis (Kwonil et al., 2015). In addition, all infected pigs had PEDV-like lesions characterized by thin and transparent intestinal walls and accumulation of large amounts of yellow fluid in the intestinal lumen (Kwonil et al., 2015). Further, histology analysis exhibited acute diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis and mild vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells in cecum and colon (Kwonil et al., 2015). The pathogenicity of PDCoV in conventional pigs were also confirmed with the subsequent isolation (Chen et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018). All these studies target suckling piglets, however, there are still sporadic outbreaks of diarrhea in weaned piglets with unknown reasons.",

Currently it is known that PDCoV infection inhibits the production of interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2) through suppressing the activation of RIG-signaling pathway (Luo et al., 2016) in vitro. Nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) of PDCoV was a newly identified IFN antagonist by cleaving NEMO (Zhu et al., 2017a) and destroyed subsequent type I interferon signaling by cleaving STAT2 (Zhu et al., 2017b). In addition, another protein (NS6) of PDCoV was also found to antagonize IFN-\u03b2 production by interfering with binding of RIG-I/MDA5 to double-stranded RNA (Fang et al., 2018). However, little is known about the innate immune responses in vivo against PDCoV infection.",

Consistent with the type I interferon results, PDCoV could increase the mRNA expressions of PKR (p < 0.05) in Peyer's patches from weaned piglets infected with PDCoV at 3 d.p.i., but not other antiviral effector genes like OAS and Mx1, indicating that PKR plays a critical role against PDCoV infection (Fig. 5, Fig. 6\n).",

We infected the 33-day-old weaned piglets with the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain via oral feeding. PDCoV causing severe diarrhea in weaned piglets strongly suggested that PDCoV posed a huge threat to weaned piglets like newborn piglets in pig farms. Interestingly, unlike in newborn piglets, PDCoV infection did not cause vomiting and death in weaned piglets at a high dose (1 \u00d7 109 TCID50/head) in 7 days, indicating that newborn piglets were more susceptible to PDCoV infection than weaned piglets. This phenomenon demonstrated that PDCoV infection is another age-dependent disease severity like PEDV and TGEV (Moon et al., 1975; Isao et al., 2000). Furthermore, we collected fecal swabs from the PDCoV-challenged piglets and detected the viral fecal shedding by real-time PCR. PDCoV RNA was detected from 1 d.p.i. to 7 d.p.i., while no RNA was detected in the negative control piglets during the study, indicating that the infection with PDCoV by fecal-oral contamination might be the major mode of transmission for diarrhea in pig farms. In addition, microscopic lesions were obviously observed in jejunums of the 33-day-old piglets at necropsy at 3 d.p.i. and 7 d.p.i., similar to observations in PDCoV infected newborn piglets (Xu et al., 2018). What is more, no microscopic lesions were observed in any other organs of PDCoV-challenged weaned piglets (data not shown), indicating that intestinal tract might be the target organ of PDCoV. Consistent with the histopathological results, the PDCoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the PDCoV-challenged weaned piglets by immunohistochemical analysis. Together, all these results confirmed that the PDCoV could also cause enteric diseases in weaned piglets.",

            "text": "It might not fully reflect the body's immune status because the immune system of the neonatal suckling piglets is fragile and immature when virus infection occurs. And we found that PDCoV did not activate T lymphocytes of Peyer's patches from newborn piglets (data not shown). In addition, PDCoV was highly pathogenic to the weaned piglets. Taken together, we attempted to turn to pigs with more mature immune system like weaned piglets to study the impact of PDCoV infection on the immune system. Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against a wide variety of pathogenic infections (Li et al., 2013). Pathogen associated pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are essential portion of the innate immune response in hosts against viral infection. Several classes of PRRs have been identified: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), Nod-like receptors (NLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (Iborra and Sancho, 2015; Mosser and Suresh, 2013). Of these PRRs, TLRs and RLRs play a critical role in recognition of RNA virus infection (Akira and Takeuchi, 2009). TLR3, which localize on the endosomal membrane, recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Lena et al., 2001). It was reported that PEDV infection induces NF-\u03baB activation through the TLR3 pathways in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (Cao et al., 2015). The small intestinal mucosa is thought to be the primary site for defense against enteropathogen (Yuan et al., 2018). And Peyer's patches serve as the primary inductive sites for intestinal immunity (Fang and Vazquenz-Torres, 2000), which occupy most of the area in the ileum (Van Kruiningen et al., 2002). In the present study, we found that the mRNA expression of TLR3 was induced in Peyer's patches from PDCoV-infected weaned piglets, indicating that PDCoV could active innate immune response in pigs. After recognition of viral nucleic acids, TLRs could recruit downstream kinases that phosphorylate downstream adaptor proteins to transmit signals to activate transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which are mainly involved in IFN and pro-inflammatory genes induction (Wang et al., 2018). Our results demonstrate that PDCoV infection could induce the expression of IL-12 in Peyer's patches at 3 d.p.i., which might be the result of TLR3 activation. However, PDCoV did not affect the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) in vivo. It seems that the body will activate cellular immunity against PDCoV infection at the later stage. In addition, we also found that PDCoV could increase the mRNA expressions of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in Peyer's patches at 3 d.p.i. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as important cytokines induced by virus induction could establish an anti-viral state in infected cells and neighboring non-infected cells, and also regulate the adaptive immune response (Xie et al., 2018). It is known that IFNs production trigger the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) against virus infection (Lenschow et al., 2007), such as dsRNA activated protein kinase R (PKR) (Williams, 1999), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) (Sanfilippo et al., 2018) and Mx proteins (Zhou et al., 2018). In this study, we found that PDCoV could increase the mRNA expressions of PKR in Peyer's patches. Interestingly, other ISGs like OAS and Mx1 did not increase upon PDCoV infection, indicating that the body restrain the PDCoV RNA transfer mainly by PKR. In addition, all results shown that innate immunity occurred only at 3 d.p.i., but not 7 d.p.i., indicating that virus might have overcome the innate immunity to infect the body at 7 d.p.i. Since PDCoV induced innate immune response in vivo, several important questions are raised. For example, What\u2019s the viral protein of PDCoV inducing the expressions of these cytokines in vivo? And what\u2019s the exact underlying mechanism? How to overcome the innate immune response to cause damage when PDCoV infection occurs? More efforts will be required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.",
