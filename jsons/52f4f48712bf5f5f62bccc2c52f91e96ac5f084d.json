AHA database: no articles pertaining to ILCOR question Cochrane: no relevant reviews DISCUSSION: There is a diverse variety of mental, written and electronic checklists or aide-memoires used within medical practice (and even more used as part of educational and professional assessments) but little data on their effectiveness as interventions in improving clinical outcomes during emergency situations such as resuscitation. The limited evidence that does exist relates to proxy measures, such as performance in simulations and recall of factual information needed for resuscitation, and, often applies only to part of the resuscitation protocol and potential benefits or harm may be specific to the type of checklist used and the scenario rather than generalisable.",

The short checklist and no checklist groups had similar levels of overall performance using while the detailed long checklist did significantly better than no checklist in performing key steps (p<0.02) and ratio of compressions to ventilation breaths (p<0.01). Importantly, this single study shows proxy outcomes which are highly checklistspecific. A major limitation of this study is that the intervention which worked would not be practical for use in public.",

One studied skill retention in non-medical hospital employees given an animation-assisted reminder tool on their mobile phone at the time of retesting compared to no tool at more than 6 months after CPR training (Choa, 2009) . Simulator performance in particular with chest compression was greater with the intervention (p<0.001). The same group found improved performance comparing their animated instruction to telephone instruction by dispatcher (Choa, 2008) . In both cases the study commenced after the animated video clip was started eliminating any delay in starting resuscitation from the intervention. Two other studies looked at devices compared to no additional input in members of the public. In one (Ertl, 2007) , although there were improvements in the performance of BLS, the personal digital assistant was operated by an assistant following the candidate's instructions. In the other (Zanner, 2007) , the mobile phone first aid application given for use when \"they thought it to be beneficial\" resulted in a significant delay in the time to complete two complete cycles of CPR (4.24 vs 2.41 min; p<0.001).",

            "text": "Three studies looked at the use of checklists or cognitive aids by anaesthetic residents in simulated emergencies, viz. malignant hyperthermia (Berkenstadt 2006 , 530, Harrison 2006 , advanced neonatal resuscitation (Bould 2009, 570), VF/pulseless VT and bradycardia (Schneider 1995, 358) . The Berkenstadt (2006, 530) and Schneider (1995, 358 ) studies used computer-based aids, on which the doctors had training immediately before the studies started, while the Bould (2009, 570), and Harrison (2006, 551) studies each provided a poster, with instructions to the participants about its availability, in the first study, and no instruction, in the second. Both general and specific factors in the interaction between participants and the aids used in these scenarios are likely to have influenced the effectiveness of any specific aid on improving or impairing performance. For example, the effect of immediate pre-study training with a computer is likely to have artificially favoured the outcome of the aid; similarly, the 20-minute timescale of gradual clinical deterioration in the malignant hyperthermia scenarios might make the use of any aid more appropriate and useful (such as in ensuring accurate drug dosing). In contrast, the more acute neonatal emergency required a more rapid response within the 5-minute timescale of the Bould study (2009, 570) , and, therefore, even though instructed that a poster would be available, timepressure was identified as a factor by 24% of participants for not using it. In addition, the lack of any practical experience of newborn resuscitation during their anaesthetic residency might have contributed to a lack of insight into their own competence, and might explain the response by 29% that a checklist was not needed despite the universal poor performance.",

            "text": "The more simple use of an aid in factual recall of correct doses of drugs, fluids for resuscitation or reversible causes of cardiorespiratory arrest may be less prone to cognitive errors during the stress of performing ALS. This benefit of cognitive aids has been studied as an outcome in some the above simulation studies and, if artificially separated from the more complex individual and team performance, would seem to be supportive of their use. Two further studies reinforce this point (Dyson 2004 , 457, McCallum 2004 . Comparison of different aide-memoires on recall of causes of electromechanical dissociation was studied by telephone survey in junior doctors one month after receiving one of two aide-memoires (Dyson 2004, 457) . Median recall improved more in the \"EMD-aide\" than the \"4Hs+4Ts\" group (p=0.03). This may have been related to an increase in time spent studying the new aidememoire compared to revision of \"4Hs+4Ts\" (which the Resuscitation Council introduced in 1997) rather than being specific to this mnemonic. Unfortunately, it did not include a \"no checklist\" control to allow assessment of mnemonics as an intervention against the effect of being in a study. As a checklist it only covers a limited aspect of the whole resuscitation protocol. The use of a portable resuscitation card (McCallum 2004, 477) improved accuracy of calculations when assessed by questionnaire but both these lacked a \"no checklist\" control. The latter study was more comprehensive as it also assessed how to call for assistance, estimate weight and select endotracheal tube size. Percentage of correct answers improved from 58 to 92% with the card. The effect of introducing an aid and any training associated with its introduction is likely to have a significant learning effect but there is no evidence that this effect is more than short-term. In this light, the introduction of checklists and aids to reinforce education and improve performance might be justified because of the potential of a non-checklist specific training effect on knowledge retention and performance by resuscitation teams if it were accompanied by frequent training but not without those controls. As the purpose of this review is to consider the evidence or any specific effect on outcomes from the use of cognitive aids or checklists, I have not included any contribution of potential educational benefits in the treatment recommendation.",
