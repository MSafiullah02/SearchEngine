Moreover, investigating the impact on long term outcomes and working 347 towards the standardization of reporting data about first responders systems is highly emphasized. 348 suggest that first responders may be able to timely reach the OHCA before ambulance arrival and 353 reduce the intervention-free time by starting CPR and attaching an AED. These advantages could 354 lead to an improvement in rates of CPR performed before ambulance arrival and survival to hospital 355 discharge or at 30 days. We identified several differences among first responder systems and found 356 that the right choice of strategy and technological implementation play a critical role in their 357 effectiveness. However, RCTs are needed to provide conclusive data. n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a Good Samaritan [31] n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a PulsePoint Respond",

The first strategy prioritized first responders to reach the OHCA site 200 directly to deliver early CPR and discretionally retrieve an AED[19,21,22,24,35,44] significantly 201 shortening the total intervention time and the time of CPR initiation (197 s [120-306 s] vs. 275 202 [184-414 s]; p < 0.001) in one observational study [35]. In the second strategy, the closest first 203 responders were instructed to collect an AED and the remaining went directly to the patient. 204 [20,25,32,41,43,45] A third strategy organized a team of three responders with two of them 205 reaching the event site (one for performing CPR and one for coordinating) and the third one 206 collecting the AED.
