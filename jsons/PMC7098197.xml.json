Any drug that stops activation of the classical pathway will affect the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Inhibition of the activation pathways may disrupt an individual's capacity to mount an adaptive immune response, although therapeutic inhibition later in life is less detrimental as adaptive immunity is established and developed in older individuals. Anti-complement drugs may also disrupt normal lipid metabolism or interfere with the healing and resolution of injuries. All of these potentially damaging effects need to be considered when deciding whether and when to use an anti-complement drug and which part of the system to target. With appropriate prophylactic measures such as immunization and antibiotic therapy, and with careful consideration of the target, most of these effects can be managed.",

These strategies have spawned drugs that have entered the clinic, in some instances with dramatic effect. The C5-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) eculizumab prevents MAC formation; opsonization is thus unaffected by eculizumab treatment and the risk of meningococcal infection can be mitigated through vaccination and antibiotics. The C3 blocker compstatin and an antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) directed against Factor D (FD), administered intravitreally, have undergone clinical trials for AMD19,20. The compstatin derivative APL-2 (Apellis Pharmaceuticals; a long half-life form) has just entered Phase I trials for add-on to standard-of-care in PNH; it will be interesting to see how systemic administration affects the risk of infection. Chimeric agents, comprising a complement ligand-targeting modality linked to a complement inhibitor, localize activity at the disease site. This concept has shown promise in murine models and has been developed as a therapy for PNH21,22. For any anti-complement drug, short-term inhibition for acute indications in a hospital setting is unlikely to incur serious risk of immune complex disease, and infection risk can be managed with tailored antibiotic cover.",

There are several discrete ways in which an agent might act to influence complement (Fig. 1). An agent might inhibit progression in the activation or terminal pathways, act as an antagonist of an activation product, or cause activation and consumption of complement. Another broad distinction can be drawn between those drugs that inhibit complement systemically and those that are directed to specific sites of pathology to localize their inhibitory activity. Anti-complement drugs can also be divided into categories based upon their molecular characteristics: purified or recombinant forms of naturally occurring human regulators; modified protein copies or mimics of natural regulators; copies of pathogen-derived regulators; mAbs or fragments of mAbs; naturally occurring or synthetic small-molecule inhibitors; or antisense or similar nucleic acid constructs. Finally, anti-complement agents can be grouped according to the part of the system they target, a convention that we follow in this Review.",

            "text": "Targeting the binding and assembly of the initiating complex. Initiation of classical or lectin pathway activation involves the recognition of an activating surface; in the classical pathway this activation occurs through a surface-bound antibody that ligates C1q, whereas in the lectin pathway this occurs via specific sugars on the surface that bind to MBL or collectins (Fig. 1). Agents that block these events would switch off the respective activation pathways at the very first step, an attractive prospect given the amplifying nature of the complement system51. A potential classical pathway inhibitor might block C1q-binding sites on the antibody or the antibody-binding sites on C1q. A lectin pathway inhibitor might mask surface MBL-binding sugars or the sugar-binding sites on MBL. In either case, the agent would need to bind the target with higher affinity than the physiological ligand to compete effectively. Alternatively, an agent could disrupt or prevent the assembly of the multi-molecular complex, which comprises the recognition unit (C1q and MBL in the classical and lectin pathways, respectively) and the associated enzymes (C1r and C1s in the classical pathway and MASP1 and MASP2 in the lectin pathway) that are essential for pathway activation52. Both complexes circulate preassembled in plasma, so any agent targeting the complex would need to dislodge the bound enzyme to be effective; surprisingly, the C1s- and MASP2-targeting mAbs from True North and Omeros, respectively (described below), both achieve this effect. Another approach to inhibiting activation of the complexes would be to develop a molecular lock that restricts the conformational changes in C1q or MBL that occur upon ligand binding and are essential for activation of the associated enzymes. Such approaches have been used successfully to develop small-molecule inhibitors of chemokine receptor activation53,54, but have not yet been reported for C1 or the MBL\u2013MASP complex.",

The enzymatic activity of the classical or lectin pathway-initiating complexes is provided by the serine proteases C1s and MASP2, respectively. In the C1 complex, immunoglobulin binding induces conformational changes in C1q, triggering auto-activation of C1r that in turn cleaves and activates C1s in the same complex. The precise steps involved in activation of the MBL\u2013MASP complex are less clear but probably involve a similar multi-step process58. The serine protease enzymes in these complexes are potential targets for pharmacological inhibition. Both the pharmaceutical industry and nature itself have invested heavily in the development of serine protease inhibitors (SPIs), and numerous SPI drugs have been made, of differing specificities and compositions, to target the myriad serine proteases essential for digestion, haemostasis, immunity, reproduction and many other physiological and pathological processes. The biggest problem in designing an SPI drug to inhibit a particular protease is specificity \u2014 almost all SPI drugs have some 'off-target' effects that can limit their use. Even nature struggles \u2014 the sole natural inhibitor of C1r and C1s is an SPI, C1 inhibitor (C1INH; also known as SERPING1), but C1INH also controls MASPs and proteases in the coagulation and kinin systems. Indeed, deficiency of C1INH leads to dysregulation in all these proteolytic cascades that, in aggregate, cause the disease HAE59,60. C1INH removes activated C1r and C1s from C1q to form a stable complex in which C1INH itself is cleaved and inactivated.",

More than 40 years ago, patients with HAE were shown to be deficient in C1INH and to respond to plasma replacement, provoking efforts to purify C1INH for treatment of acute attacks59,61. Remarkable successes in these early studies rapidly led to the adoption of plasma-derived C1INH as the standard of care for acute episodes in HAE. The obvious advantage of this approach is that a plasma-derived molecule should be low risk (once infectious agents are eliminated) and non-immunogenic. The widespread availability of industrial-scale protein-fractionation facilities \u2014 established for the production of immunoglobulins, albumin and other plasma products \u2014 made this a viable approach for purifying C1INH. Unfortunately, concerns about viral transmission in plasma-derived proteins have led to its removal from the clinic in several countries, including the United States. Recent methodology improvements and new approaches to production of C1INH have changed this unsatisfactory situation; two ultra-pure plasma-derived C1INH products, Cinryze and Berinert (CSL Behring) are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies. Some companies invested in better methods of purifying plasma C1INH, whereas others set about making it. A full-length recombinant C1INH was first reported a decade ago. This agent, termed Ruconest (Salix Pharmaceuticals), has been approved for therapy of acute attacks in Europe and, very recently (July 2014), also in the United States.",

The C3-cleaving enzymes of the classical, lectin and alternative pathways, C4b2a and C3bBb, are assembled in quite different ways despite their functional and structural similarities (Fig. 2). In the classical and lectin pathways, C4 is cleaved by activated C1s (or MASP2) in the surface-bound C1 (or MBL\u2013MASP) complex; the large C4b fragment binds to adjacent surfaces via a nucleophilic attack on a thioester group, captures C2 and presents it for cleavage by C1s or MASP2 as above. The C4b2a complex is the C3 convertase of the classical and lectin pathways. C2a is a serine protease that cleaves C3 to form C3a and the opsonin C3b; C2a can also cleave C5 (when properly presented) to form C5a and C5b. These two complement proteins are the sole substrates of the C2a serine protease. Assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase requires C3b, generated through classical and lectin pathway activation or from tickover activation on surfaces. C3b binds to FB, triggering major conformational changes that expose FB to cleavage by FD, a unique plasma serine protease that has FB as its sole substrate. The C3bBb complex is the C3 convertase used in the alternative pathway; the Bb fragment, generated from FB cleavage, is a serine protease that cleaves C3 and C5 in precisely the same manner as C2a in the classical pathway. The key amplifying role of the alternative pathway makes it a very attractive source of drug targets that can be targeted in a variety of ways (Fig. 2).",

Agents might target the assembly of one or more of the complexes, preventing complex formation and/or causing complexes to break up. They might target one or more of the serine proteases responsible for formation of the convertase (C1r, C1s, MASP2 or FD), convertase activity (C2a or Bb) or convertase regulation (FI). Alternatively, they might target the substrates of these enzymes, C3 or C5, by blocking binding to or cleavage by the convertase or acting as molecular locks to prevent conformational changes essential for activation. Agents might also target active fragments (C3a, C5a, C3b or C5b) to block their downstream effects. Indeed, nature has adopted some of these strategies to keep complement in check. The convertases are naturally labile and break up in a matter of minutes; regulatory proteins that accelerate this decay exist both in plasma and on membranes, and they function by binding to the complex and displacing the enzyme. Some of these regulatory proteins remain bound after decay and act as cofactors for the further cleavage and irreversible inactivation of C3b or C4b by the plasma serine protease FI.",

To date, none of the other plasma regulators has entered the clinic despite a large amount of research and preclinical activity. In vitro studies more than 35 years ago showed that modest (around 10% above baseline) increases in the concentrations of the complement regulators FH and FI markedly reduced plasma alternative-pathway activity, provoking the suggestion that augmentation of these proteins might be of therapeutic benefit74; however, large (and probably frequent) doses will be required to substantially alter the levels of these abundant proteins. Despite this, there has been considerable recent interest in using plasma-derived FH as a therapy, particularly in those diseases strongly linked to FH polymorphisms and mutations. Deficiency of FH is rare and always associated with severe C3 dysregulation in plasma or on cell surfaces that leads to a range of renal diseases, including C3 glomerulopathy and aHUS; FH deficiency has been successfully treated with plasma exchange, strongly suggesting that FH would be an effective therapy in these diseases75. Indeed, in FH-deficient mice, therapy with human FH reversed renal injury76. AMD is strongly linked with the FH Y402H polymorphism, and this has provoked intense interest in giving at-risk individuals the protective Y402 form of FH to prevent or treat AMD. Several companies established programmes to produce plasma-derived or recombinant FH with this as the primary aim, but none of these programmes survive. Of note, some evidence from mouse models and human studies suggest that FH would need to be administered intra-ocularly in AMD to control complement dysregulation locally and alter the course of disease77,78.",

The membrane regulators of the C3 convertases present a different challenge compared to the plasma regulators in that they cannot readily be purified for testing as potential drugs. The only way to test whether a membrane regulator might work as a therapeutic is to make a recombinant soluble form. The first of these, described in 1990, was a soluble recombinant form of CR1 (known as sCR1 or TP10) comprising the entire extracellular sequence of thirty short consensus repeats (>1,800 amino acids). The protein was a powerful inhibitor of both classical and alternative pathway convertases in vitro in human and rodent sera; pre-treatment with sCR1 protected against reperfusion injury in a rat model of myocardial infarction88. Over the ensuing two decades, this agent provided an excellent proof-of-principle for complement inhibition in diverse models of human disease, effective in a wide range of disease models and in rodents, pigs and primates. After initial development work by SmithKline Beecham, Avant Immunotherapeutics took sCR1 into clinical trials in adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury and cardiopulmonary bypass; although some positive results were described37, there were also many failures, notably in large sepsis trials, and sCR1 has not progressed for these indications. More recently, guided by success in animal models, sCR1 entered clinical trials in dense deposit disease (CDX-1135; Celldex Therapeutics); regrettably, this study terminated in 2014 because of recruitment issues.",

Although the empiric use of cobra venom in therapy has a long history in everything from cancer to cosmetics, CVF as a drug has severe limitations: first because it is immunogenic, which renders repeat injections ineffective, and second because rapid and complete activation of complement by CVF generates high concentrations of C5a, causing circulating neutrophils to activate and aggregate in the lungs and other organs102. It is also unclear whether CVF can deplete complement locally in tissues. Attempts to address immunogenicity through humanization of CVF have created a hybrid that is 94% identical to human C3; small stretches of CVF-derived sequences in the C3 \u03b1-chain are sufficient to retain CVF-like complement consumption103.

Similar to other GPCRs, those that bind C5a and C3a are attractive drug targets; many specific small-molecule blockers have been developed for cytokine receptors, although few have been developed for chemokine receptors, which more closely resemble the C3a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor (C3aR) and C5aR1 (Ref. 108). Domp\u00e9 Pharmaceutical have described small-molecule C5aR1 blockers and claim potential for therapy of a wide panel of diseases; however, no trials are yet reported. Perhaps the most studied C5aR1 blocker is the cyclic hexapeptide PMX53, invented by Taylor and Woodruff and developed first by Peptech and then Arana Therapeutics109. This agent, modelled on the C terminus of C5a, showed high specificity and nanomolar affinity for C5aR1 and worked across many species; this latter property enabled the testing of PMX53 in a broad sweep of rodent models of inflammatory disease, and in many of these models this peptide had good efficacy. A number of Phase I and IIa clinical trials with PMX53 were initiated in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis and AMD; the molecule proved safe, but all trials were terminated because of poor efficacy. One possible reason for these failures was the poor oral bioavailability and tissue penetrance of PMX53 (Ref. 110). A modified version of PMX53, PMX205, shows improvements in these parameters and may re-surface in future trials, perhaps in combination with other agents. An orally active small molecule that blocks C5aR1 has also been developed by ChemoCentryx; this agent, CCX-168, has completed Phase II studies in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, in which it was successful in enabling the reduction and elimination of high-dose corticosteroids and demonstrated improvement in renal health parameters. In 2014, CCX-168 was granted Orphan Drug status in both ANCA-associated vasculitides and aHUS. Emerging evidence for the role of C3a as a 'modulator' of the C5a-driven inflammatory response highlights the potential for C3aR agonism in acute neutrophil-driven pathologies such as ischaemia\u2013reperfusion injury106,111.",

InflaRx have developed a blocking mAb against C5a (IFX-1) that is currently in a Phase II trial for early sepsis and septic shock. Noxxon described a series of L-RNA aptamers (Spiegelmer; NOX-D19 to NOX-D21) that block C5a; these agents were effective in models of sepsis and transplant rejection112,113, but have not yet progressed to humans. All of the above suggests that pharmacological blockade of C3a and/or C5a activities might be relatively straightforward; however, such an approach will only work in those situations in which these molecules are the major drivers of pathology, such as in neutrophil-mediated disorders including ANCA-vasculitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lupus.",

The small fragment, C5a, is a powerful chemoattractant, and therapeutic blockade of its activities is described above. The larger fragment, C5b, forms the foundation of the MAC. Assembly of the MAC involves the non-enzymatic aggregation of the five terminal pathway components (C5b and C6\u2013C9) into a pore that inserts into and through the cell membrane. C5b, while still attached to the convertase, binds sequentially to C6 and C7; the C5b67 complex is released from the convertase and binds to the membrane via a labile hydrophobic site. C8 and multiple copies of C9 are recruited in turn to build the pore. MAC activity is naturally regulated by inefficiencies built into the assembly system and by regulators policing the membrane to block complexes that reach the surface. The hydrophobic binding site in C5b67 is intrinsically unstable, decaying by interaction with water in a fraction of a second. Additionally, there are several proteins in the plasma that bind to the MAC to further restrict its capacity to bind to the membrane: clusterin and vitronectin (also known as S protein) are multifunctional proteins that, among their many roles, inhibit MAC assembly in this way, and C8 is an efficient inhibitor if it binds to C5b67 in the fluid phase. Once bound to the membrane, C5b67 is protected from these plasma inhibitors and recruits C8 and C9 to form the MAC. The last line of defence is the membrane regulator CD59, a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that binds to the forming complex and prevents the completion of the MAC pore.",

            "text": "Opportunities for therapeutic inhibition are legion. The first obvious target is the first MAC component, C5b. Cutting off the supply of C5b by targeting the C3 and C5 convertases will inhibit MAC production; alternatively, C5 itself can be targeted to render it resistant to cleavage, which is the mode of action of the C5 monoclonal eculizumab, the most successful complement-specific drug to date. The success of eculizumab (Box 2) has triggered interest in other ways of preventing C5 cleavage. Novartis have taken a C5-specific mAb, LFG316, into Phase II trials of intraocular therapy in advanced AMD (completed but unpublished) and, more recently, in choroiditis and panuveitis114. In August 2015, Novartis announced Phase I trials to assess the safety and efficacy of LFG316 in patients with PNH (NCT02534909). A recombinant human C5-specific mAb fragment, Mubodina (Adienne Pharma & Biotech), that prevents cleavage of C5 has undergone early-stage trials in aHUS and other renal diseases, although no development has been reported recently. Ornithodoros moubata complement inhibitor (OmCI), a small (16 kDa) lipocalin present in the saliva of soft ticks, is a potent C5 inhibitor that probably protects the tick from complement in its blood meal115. Recombinant OmCI (Coversin; Volution Immuno Pharmaceuticals) blocked C5 in numerous species and inhibited disease in rodent models116,117. The drug bound C5 at a site remote from the convertase cleavage site, suggesting that it functioned by either blocking the interaction of C5 with the convertase or preventing conformational change essential for cleavage. Coversin completed Phase I trials in 2014 and is in development for PNH and other MAC-driven diseases. SOBI002 is a C5-blocker that is based on Affibody technology and developed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum. Inclusion of an albumin-binding motif extends the plasma half-life of SOBI002. This small (~12 kDa) protein, derived using phage display, avidly binds to C5 and prevents cleavage; the simple structure of SOBI002 makes synthesis easy and inexpensive. SOBI002 is currently in a Phase I trial, which was recently listed as terminated (NCT02083666). Various non-biologic approaches have also been developed and are either soon to be tested or already in clinical trials. Ophthotech have developed a C5-specific aptamer (ARC1905, also known as Zimura) that, when given intraocularly in a Phase IIa study in combination with an antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), improved outcomes in patients with wet AMD. The RNAi approach taken by Alnylam is described above; at the 2014 American Society of Haematology (ASH) meeting, Alnylam reported effective knockdown in non-human primates using ALN-CC5 (see Further information), and Phase I trials are now underway with PNH as the primary indication. Interim Phase I data demonstrate substantial knock-down of C5 in single-ascending-dose studies in humans (as announced in a recent Alnylam press release). RaPharma have developed a cyclic peptide that binds to C5 and prevents cleavage and activation; promising preclinical data were reported at ASH 2014 (see Further information), and Phase I studies are proposed for the near future. As with many of the C5-targeting agents reported here, the primary indication is likely to be PNH. The crowded 'landscape' in the C5 space (Fig. 3) clearly illustrates the activity generated by the success of eculizumab and the desire to block the activities of this key component in the cascade.",

Blocking C5 cleavage by any of the above strategies will stop the production of C5a as well as the MAC and this may have important consequences if continued long term. To specifically target the MAC, agents with activities downstream of C5 cleavage are needed. Agents that mimic the ability of the natural inhibitors clusterin and vitronectin (and C8) to compete for the membrane binding site on C5b67 might further reduce the efficiency of membrane attack, whereas mimics of CD59 that block the final steps of MAC assembly might be effective blockers of lytic pore formation. Soluble recombinant CD59 (sCD59) has been generated and shown to inhibit lysis in vitro; however, in vivo, sCD59 binds to plasma proteins, markedly reducing its inhibitory effects118. Recombinant CD59, attached to the same membrane-binding motif as in Mirococept, has been generated and shown to protect PNH erythrocytes from lysis ex vivo and ameliorate arthritis development in a rat model when administered intra-articularly at the time of disease induction119,120. Alternatively, any one of the terminal pathway components, each of which is essential for MAC formation, could be targeted. Regenesance BV has targeted C6 with both blocking C6-specific mAb and antisense approaches, and the latter was effective in animal models105. Regenesance also described a small-molecule inhibitor of C6 in development for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but further development was not reported. A recent publication describes a small molecule (aurin tricarboxylic acid) that inhibits MAC assembly by blocking C9 binding; the agent prevented the lysis of PNH erythrocytes by serum ex vivo121.",

It is important that the drug that is delivered to the site is able to 'recycle' and release its target once inactivated, otherwise the target surface will rapidly become saturated with useless agent. More than 20 years ago, we described a prodrug approach whereby recombinant forms of natural regulators were generated as Fc fusion proteins in which regulatory activity was absent because of steric hindrance.

Today, we boast just two anti-complement drugs that are being marketed, approved only in rare orphan diseases (HAE, PNH and aHUS), which is a rather disappointing outcome given the investments made by researchers and companies. However, the future looks much brighter; new therapeutics are entering the clinic, targeting different parts of the complement system, with different half-lives, different routes of administration and each with its own range of activities and side effects (Fig. 3). Importantly, although the emphasis on orphan applications was pivotal in getting the first agents to the market, many of the new agents target common acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, for example AMD, arthritis and cardiovascular disease.",

Short-duration complement inhibition, particularly in a controlled clinical environment, carries the least risk, and anti-complement drugs will probably first become mainstream for acute indications, such as reperfusion injuries. For chronic conditions, cost, ease of administration and safety may be substantial issues. Cost will become less of an issue as increased competition (the emergence of small-molecule inhibitors) and increased use should, theoretically, bring prices down rapidly. The experience of chronic therapy with agents that block complement is still relatively short-term, and it is possible that the elimination of molecules, such as C5a, may affect other activities of this multi-functional molecule, such as modulation of adaptive immunity, in the long term106. However, eculizumab was approved for use in PNH in 2007 and for aHUS in 2011 and, although the long-term consequences of C5 blockade remain uncertain, it is encouraging that after almost a decade of use no substantial adverse effects have been noted in carefully monitored and compliant recipients.",

Alternatively, a drug may be engineered to deliver complement inhibition where it is needed at the site of disease.

            "text": "Selecting the right agent or agents will be crucial to success in trials, and here a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which complement drives pathology in the target disease is a sine qua non. Biomarkers that reflect complement activation in fluids and tissues can inform the selection of the right drug for the right patient, demonstrating engagement of the target and efficacy of the drug, and monitoring response to therapy. A lack of good biomarkers often handicaps early stage trials and simple readouts of effectiveness are crucial. In some cases this is obvious; for example, blockade of MAC formation can be demonstrated in serum through simple haemolytic assays. When activation fragments such as C3a, C5a, C4d, Bb and terminal complement complex (TCC) are present in the disease their levels can be monitored to demonstrate response to therapy and confirm target engagement. In some diseases, such as PNH, there is an obvious clinical readout of target engagement \u2014 eculizumab treatment prevents intravascular haemolysis in PNH. However, for diseases restricted to specific sites, for example, the retina, central nervous system or kidney glomerulus, plasma complement biomarkers may not reflect the response to therapy and are poor tools for assessing target engagement. There is thus a need for effective, non-invasive methods to detect complement activation and deposition within affected tissues without resorting to biopsy. Methods for imaging complement activation in vivo may fill this need; agents comprising the C3-binding domain of CR2 have been used to detect C3 fragments deposited in the kidney by magnetic resonance imaging in mouse models127. Antibodies against C3dg have also been developed as imaging agents and shown to identify retinal lesions in a mouse model of AMD128. Further development of the capacity to image complement activation in vivo will inform the conduct of future clinical trials by providing measurable outcomes and early proof of target engagement.",

Activation is triggered through classical (antibody) or lectin (sugar) pathways that rapidly converge to form a complement C3-cleaving enzyme (C3 convertase), C4b2a. The alternative pathway can be independently activated to generate its own C3 convertase (C3bBb) but, more importantly, amplifies activation regardless of trigger. C3 fragments, both soluble and surface-attached, engage specific receptors on expressing cells to mediate key activities. The C5 convertase, formed by the recruitment of an additional C3b into the C3 convertase, cleaves C5 to release a small fragment, C5a, which binds to receptors on expressing cells to mediate activation events. Formation of C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway; sequential recruitment of components C6, C7, C8 and C9 creates a pore in the target membrane \u2013 the membrane attack complex (MAC) \u2013 that can activate or kill the targeted cell. The complement system presents many targets for inhibition with drugs. In the activation pathways these include the initiating complexes and enzymes, the initiators of the alternative pathway loop and the C3 convertases. In the C3\u2013C5 axis, potential targets include the individual components (for example, C3 and C5), the activation fragments (for example, C3a and C5a) and the C5 convertases. In the terminal pathway, agents might target individual components (such as C5, C6 or C7) or intermediates (such as C5b6 and C5b67), block the functional MAC pore or inhibit the downstream signalling events that mediate cell activation or destruction. \nPowerPoint slide\n",

Tight regulation is provided in the plasma by enzymes and cofactors that remove the C3 fragment C3b from the feedback cycle for breakdown into smaller fragments. As a consequence, the C3b feedback cycle normally operates at a very low rate (tickover). The balance between activation and regulation is disturbed in disease; a healthy balance can be restored by providing extra control (for example, increasing regulation, such as that provided by the complement regulatory protein Factor H (FH), thereby increasing 'feed out' from the amplification loop) or by preventing the formation of C3b in the feedback cycle (for example, by blocking convertase enzyme, thereby decreasing 'feed in' to the amplification loop).
