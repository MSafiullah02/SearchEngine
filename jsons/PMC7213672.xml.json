These cases were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Further analysis through unbiased sequencing and isolation of airway epithelial cells revealed a previously unknown betacoronavirus, named 2019-nCOV (2019 novel coronavirus), which became the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans 2. Early reports suggested the onset of a potential coronavirus outbreak because of the high reproduction number. By the end of January 2020, 7,734 cases were confirmed in China, with 90 others being reported in other countries including Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan, Republic of Korea, United States, India, Australia, Canada, France, and Germany. At this time, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On April 4, 2020, the most recent date covered by this review, the WHO reported 1,051,697 confirmed cases and 56,986 deaths in 207 countries affected by the epidemic 3, after coronavirus disease (COVID-19, named by the WHO on February 11, 2020) was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 4.",

This phenomenon brought the attention to the greatest challenge posed by this disease: the high demand for health-care services versus the capability of health-care systems 5. The rapid growth in the numbers of infected individuals has drastically increased the demand for health services, which has led to social and health-care adaptations, ranging from social distancing to the reformulation of health-care delivery 6.",

For this review, an article was considered relevant if it (a) is related to the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) suggested approaches directly affecting surgery dynamics (e.g., reducing staff numbers, remodeling the circulation of staff and patients in the operating room, using different protection methods for patients and staff, and adapting different equipment usage), (c) suggested any kind of screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for surgical patients, or (d) had any kind of recommendation about elective procedures.

The involvement of medical students in the clerkship and subinternship periods in teaching hospitals also leads to a similar problem as trainee involvement. The use of electrocautery is controversial because it produces a high concentration of contaminated gases 20. Therefore, an article suggested avoiding its use in a pandemic setting 28. Another article suggested allowing the use of electrocautery with some modifications, such as adjusting to the lowest possible effective power and employing a smoke absorption device 15.",

Regarding surgical practice recommendations, we believe that surgical staff should be reduced to the minimum, without compromising the procedure and any operation should be performed by the most experienced surgeon, so that the procedure time is reduced. An institutional workflow to assist medical staff in decision making and in dealing with mental health issues should also be established.",
