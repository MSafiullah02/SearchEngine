Testing capacity has improved; however, access remains limited and test sensitivity is modest, which results in false negatives.4, 5 Test performance is further compromised by variations in test quality, sample collection, and duration of symptom onset, increasing the potential for error.6 For example, for a patient presenting with disorganised thinking or altered mental status, determining the date of onset of non-specific symptoms such as a cough might be difficult. Thus, the pretest probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could be hard to estimate. Fundamentally, when the sensitivity of a test is limited and the disease course for a patient is unknown, the test outcome could be unreliable and infectious patients could be placed erroneously in treatment facilities.",
