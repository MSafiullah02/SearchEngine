There is considerable diversity in the sequences and folds found in different lectin families, and more interestingly, there is also significant diversity in the quaternary structures and oligosaccharide recognition profiles found within the same family (Vijayan and Chandra, 1999). Every new structure-function study, therefore, is a precious addition to the lectin knowledge base.",

The \u03b2-prism-I fold that its subunits adopt appears to be a popular fold among known lectins across different plant classes, ranging from monocotyledonous cereals to higher plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana (Raval et al., 2004). The quaternary structures of the lectins in this family available in the PDB, commonly known as jacalin-related lectins (JRLs), also span a wide range including different types of dimers found in calsepa, banana, and the Japanese chestnut, the latter in fact resembling a hexamer; tetramers found in jacalin, artocarpin, and Maclura pomifera agglutinin; and an octamer found in heltuba. Remarkably, these variations occur despite strong sequence and fold conservation in the family and can be structurally explained by small sequence changes at subunit interfaces.",

Interestingly, a similar arrangement was observed previously in the crystal structures of another family of lectins, those from bulbs such as snowdrop and garlic. Understandably, this type of swapping enhances the intersubunit interactions, rendering subunit association much stronger. In some sense, this also suggests the dimer and not an individual subunit as the minimum biological unit, hence exerting a strong selective pressure for evolution of stable dimers. This is particularly important in view of the observations that variation in quaternary structure appears to have provided a strategy for generating diversity in carbohydrate recognition (Vijayan and Chandra, 1999).",

There is also a 3-fold sequence motif and structural repeat within each subunit, a scenario again very similar to that found in bulb lectins but unlike that in many other JRLs. Most JRLs have only one well-established binding site in their subunits; however, the recent structure of banana lectin (Singh et al., 2005) indicated two clear binding sites with weak hints about a possible third. The 3-fold internal repeat in sequence, completely missing from JRLs of higher plants (Sankaranarayanan et al., 1996), is quite visible in the monocotyledonous banana and has become clearer in the more primitive griffithsin. These two features put together are suggestive of a gene-triplication event early in lectin evolution, which has diverged sufficiently in higher plants beyond easy recognition. Thus, the study of griffithsin from an alga has provided an important clue to understanding the evolutionary trace of this class of lectins.",

            "text": "The importance of multivalency in the function of lectins is well recognized (Weis and Drickamer, 1996). It is commonly believed that multiple binding sites on each monomer are occupied simultaneously by different sugars of oligosaccharide molecules, thereby enhancing affinity in a cooperative fashion. Although there are some reports to show that different residues of the same oligosaccharide molecule can bind to two or more sites on a single lectin molecule, affinity enhancement is better explained by the formation of supramolecular assemblies formed through the crosslinking of the lectin molecules through the sugars (Sacchettini et al., 2001). Such crosslinking, which could be a generic feature of all lectins, is enabled by the multiple binding sites present on lectin molecules. Extensive computational studies carried out for garlic lectin indicated that a mannosyl nona-saccharide of the type typically present on cell surfaces cannot simultaneously occupy more than one site on a given subunit or even in a dimer, but instead crosslinks different protein molecules, with the sugars forming the required bridges (Ramachandraiah et al., 2003). Different types of crosslinks are enabled by either a different number of binding sites on the same subunit or by different quaternary structures of the same fold.",

Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al. (2006) present data to show inhibition of both replication and cytopathicity of the SARS coronavirus by griffithsin, possibly due to its binding to the glycosylated spike protein, in addition to the previously reported binding and inhibition of HIV (Mori et al., 2005). While the modes of binding at the monosaccharide level are likely to be the same in both cases, it would be interesting to understand the modes of recognition at the oligosaccharide level, for which the structure of griffithsin reported here provides a framework. Regardless of that, these data highlight the scope of lectins as useful markers in the detection and typing of different viruses.",
