Ascribing causality in this situation is difficult in view of the lack of a comparably ill control group not treated with ribavirin, the likely contribution of the underlying disease, the long intracellular half-life of ribavirin, and the lack of rechallenge information. Health authorities in Canada have restricted the use of ribavirin on the basis of a lack of in vitro antiviral effect against SARS coronavirus at therapeutic concentrations [18] and the high incidence of ribavirin-associated AEs in treated patients [19]. A recent retrospective Canadian study highlights that ribavirin may not have clinical efficacy, may actually adversely affect outcome, and may need to be prematurely discontinued because of AEs in almost 20% of patients [20]. However, widespread use of ribavirin continues in Hong Kong, where AEs comparable to the Canadian experience have not been reported and where continued use has been justified by the potential nonspecific immunomodulatory activity of the drug and in vivo activity in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus model [10]. In view of the long half-life of ribavirin, the potential for teratogenicity, and the potential for significant drug-associated morbidity and mortality, vigilant monitoring for both short-term and long-term AEs is needed for patients exposed to this drug. The Canadian experience with ribavirin in the treatment of SARS suggests that the benefits of use may not outweigh the risk of AEs and the potential for ribavirin to have negative economic consequences on hospitals endorsing its use.",
