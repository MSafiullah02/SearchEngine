It is an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) with significant infection risk to surgeon, anaesthetist and theatre staff. Open surgical tracheostomy and percutaneous dilation tracheostomy have differences in terms of aerosol generation. While the choice of technique is beyond the scope of this letter, we would like to emphasise that the surgeon or intensivist performing the tracheostomy should use the technique they are accustomed to reduce risk.",

            "text": "The first percutaneous dilation tracheostomy was performed using multiple sequential dilators over a guide wire. Over the years, two major advances were introduced: use of a single dilator and use of an intubating bronchoscope down the tracheal tube [1] . The latter is, in our view, an indispensable tool to allow safe percutaneous dilation tracheostomy. The bronchoscope allows visualisation of the needle, its correct positioning in the midline and avoidance of the posterior tracheal wall, injury of which can lead to a tracheoesophageal fistula with potentially disastrous consequences [2] . The main drawback to using a bronchoscope in COVID-19 patients is the increase risk of aerosolisation at the insertion point of the bronchoscope at the tracheal tube connection (catheter mount with suction window). We describe a closed, in-line suction system to seal the bronchoscope and reduce the risk to operators and nursing staff.",

The sheath needs to be circumferentially cut at the suction-valve end of the system ( Fig   1A) with particular attention paid to maintain integrity of the sheath. The suction catheter is removed (Fig 1B and 1C) and a single use videobronchoscope (Ambu\u00ae aScope\u2122, Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) is advanced through the sheath and the one-way valve. The sheath is then tightly taped around the proximal end of the bronchoscope shaft using a Tegaderm\u2122 (3M Healthcare, Germany) film dressing or similar tape (Fig 1D) . Length and mobility of the sheathed segment of the bronchoscope need to take into account the length of the tracheal tube, and this can be tested using an identical tracheal tube away from the patient (Fig 1E) .",
