The SARS-CoV is moderately infective, with an attack rate that ranges from 2.4 to 31 cases per 1,000 exposure hours3 and may be transmitted by aerosolization. The SARS epidemic affected thousands of people in five continents (26 countries) over a period of 9 months following its first appearance in November of 2002 in the south of China. The case fatality rate associated with SARS is about 15%. However, a higher mortality occurs in the elderly and in patients with comorbid conditions.4\n",

There were 206 patients with probable SARS in Singapore, 15% of whom died (32 patients). Of the patients who survived, 46% declined participation, could not be contacted, were underage, or could not perform the battery of tests. The 94 subjects included in this study (half of them were health-care workers) had pulmonary function tests done and the authors administered the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire. Unfortunately, exercise testing was not performed. Ong et al11 found that at 1 year, 20 to 30% of the patients had cough, sputum production, or shortness of breath, but the mean values for lung volumes were in the normal range. According to the American Thoracic Society criteria, mild and moderate impairment were present in 32% and 5%, respectively. Only 12% of the study population required admission to the ICUs for severe acute respiratory failure, and only 7% were intubated. Interestingly, the outcomes of the patients with severe respiratory failure were similar to the patients who were not admitted to the ICU. Overall, however, patients who survived SARS had worse health-related quality of life than normal subjects.",

All of these studies12, 13, 14 report common abnormalities in pulmonary function tests, but most if not all of the abnormalities were mild. It is important to emphasize that in a previous communication by Ong et al,12 in patients evaluated at 3 months after SARS, up to 78% patients had mild-to-moderate impairment of exercise capacity, although none of the patients showed ventilatory impairment during exercise. The limitations during exercise in this group may be related to poor conditioning or residual muscular problems. An important limitation of the current study is the lack of exercise test results, as we do not know the real impact of the alterations present in the breathing tests and in the health-related quality of life questionnaire.",
