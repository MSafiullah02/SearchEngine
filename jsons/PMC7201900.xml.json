Community ecology and biogeography seek to detect patterns in communities and to understand the processes that cause these patterns (Townsend, 1989). Ecologists have traditionally focused on external (i.e. abiotic environment) and intrinsic (i.e. biotic interactions) processes (Power et al., 1988), whereas biogeographers emphasise the role of historical factors (see Myers & Giller, 1988; Cornell & Lawton, 1992).",

The relative effects of historical and multi\u2010scale ecological factors may vary according to the spatial scale of the study. In a large\u2010scale study, history may be more important than in local studies, in which patterns can be explained by environmental variables alone (Townsend et al., 2003). Several studies have sought to identify the distribution of macroinvertebrate patterns in both large geographical areas (Wright et al., 1984; Corkum, 1989; Quinn & Hickey, 1990; Marchant, Barmuta & Chessman, 1995; 2001, 1999) and small ones (Ormerod & Edwards, 1987; Gra\u00e7a, Fonseca & Castro, 1989), revealing the strong relationship between aquatic biota and environmental variables. However, the historical factor has usually been overlooked.",

Therefore, both historical and environmental characteristics should be used to explain contemporary aquatic organism distribution. In the Iberian Peninsula, two historical factors are significant in defining present aquatic biota: (1) the lack of strong glaciations during the Quaternary, which played an important role in increasing biodiversity; and (2) the incorporation of part of the Baetic\u2013Riffian Massif (south and southeast of Spain) with the Hesperic Massif at the end of the Miocene (Baetic ranges) (Rosenbaum, Lister & Duboz, 2002). This joining of the Eurasian and African plates enabled North\u2010African species to enter the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula and neo\u2010endemisms to develop there (Ribera et al., 1996; Ribera, 2000).",

Because of the high endemicity and diversity of species in the Iberian Peninsula and the low number of trichopterologists, knowledge of their larvae is incomplete (Vieira\u2010Lanero, 2000). Given this, few studies have focused on the autoecology of immature stages (but see Puig et al., 1981; Gallardo\u2010Mayenco, Prenda & Toja, 1998), and no large\u2010scale study has looked at the distribution of the species and factors involved in this distribution. However, some studies have been reported in other European countries (Leuven, Vanhemelrijk & Van der Velde, 1987; Czachorowski, 1994; Wiberg\u2010Larsen et al., 2000), North America (Ross, 1963) and South Africa (de Moor, 1992).",

If historical events and ecological factors are important driving forces determining caddisfly distribution in Iberian Mediterranean basins, then we would expect to find significant contributions by both in explaining community variability. If species distributions are the result of the interaction of several multi\u2010scale filters, we would expect caddisfly distribution to respond to a mixture of basin, reach, and bedform factors, and that different assemblages would be found in different combinations of environmental conditions.",

Overall, a thermal and pluviometric gradient is present, with annual precipitation ranging from less than 300 mm in the most arid areas in the southeast to over 800 mm in northern regions or in some mountain areas. Limestone and other sedimentary rocks and deposits are dominant, although some siliceous areas are also found in the Sierra Nevada, Pyrenees and Montseny ranges (Fig. 1). Sclerophyllous and evergreen trees and shrubs are dominant, although in some areas there are deciduous and coniferous forests. Because of Mediterranean climate conditions, rivers are characterised by high seasonality, with frequent torrential floods in autumn and spring and droughts in summer (Molina, Vidal\u2010Abarca & Su\u00e1rez, 1994).",

In general, 15 sites per basin were selected, in an attempt to cover all river types present.

Samples were first examined in the field, and successive samples were taken until no more different families were found. Samples were preserved in 70% alcohol and sorted in the laboratory. Caddisfly taxa were identified to the maximum level possible (see Bonada et al. 2004a) for more information about the collected species), and rank of abundances for each taxon were recorded: 1 from one to three individuals, 2 from four to 10, 3 from 11\u2013100 and 4 for more than 100 individuals. Because of the large number of undescribed larvae in the Iberian Peninsula (Vieira\u2010Lanero, 2000) and the small size of many individuals (first larval instars), we were not able to identify the species of all larvae with certainty. When possible, pupae and adults were collected in the field to ensure correct identification. In some cases, mature larvae were reared in the laboratory. Consequently, different taxonomical levels were mixed between sites and even within a single site, which may hinder the achievement of some objectives at the community level (Cuffney et al., 2002). To minimise this problem, the caddisfly data matrix with all individuals identified at the maximum possible level (called \u2018caddis\u2010max\u2019) was compared with the same matrix in modified form (called \u2018caddis\u2010mod\u2019). This modified matrix was constructed as follows: the unidentified taxa were deleted from the analyses when they represented a small proportion of the sample, and most individuals were identified to species. In contrast, when most of the individuals remained unidentified because they were too small or too young or for taxonomical reasons, all individuals were clumped to genus or family level. Both matrices, caddis\u2010max and caddis\u2010mod, were compared using Mantel's standardised correlation coefficient (r\nM) tested by random permutations (999 runs) (Mantel, 1967).",

A dummy variable, with a value of one if the site was located in the Baetic\u2013Riffian region (Almanzora, Aguas, Adra and Guadalfeo Basins) or in the transitional area (Segura Basin), and a value of 0 if it was located elsewhere (Bes\u00f2s, Llobregat, Mijares, Turia and J\u00facar Basins), was included in the multivariate analysis to characterise the historical phenomenon.

Several canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) and partial canonical correspondence analyses (pCCA) were performed: (1) a CCA with the historical variable; (2) a CCA with the ecological variables; and (3) a pCCA with environment as variable and history as a covariable; or (4) a pCCA with history as a variable and environment as a covariable. The sum of canonical eigenvalues of each analysis compared with the sum of all eigenvalues (i.e. inertia) was retained to calculate the relative influence of both factors. Because the ecological data matrix included samples collected during different seasons, the effect of seasonality (measured as four dummy variables: spring, summer, autumn, and winter) was tested with a CCA. The relationship of this matrix with environmental variables was extracted with a pCCA. Finally, non\u2010explained variability was also calculated.",

Results of this analysis indicated that the first DCA axis has a gradient length of 5.70 standard deviation units, justifying the use of unimodal response models (Lep\u0161 & \u0160milauer, 2003). Therefore, an indirect analysis of correspondence analysis (CA) using biological data was performed. To detect how environmental variables determine organisms\u2019 patterns, direct ordination was used. A pCCA was performed instead of a simple CCA to extract the influence of temporal patterns, because significant differences between seasons in caddisfly communities were found after an Multi\u2010Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) test (A = 0.003; P = 0.022). Most significant environmental variables were selected by forward selection method and rare species were down\u2010weighted to avoid bias in the final results in CA and pCCA analysis. Canonical axes obtained with pCCA ordination were tested for significance using a Monte Carlo permutation test (199 runs). Eigenvalues of CA were kept and compared with the ones obtained in pCCA to show whether the measured environmental variables used in the pCCA reflect the gradient shown by CA. Finally, Pearson correlations were calculated between the projections of samples in CA and pCCA axes, to decide the number of axes to be interpreted. The CANOCO program was used to compute all ordinations (ter Braak & \u0160milauer, 1998).",

A stepwise discriminant analysis using the Wilks\u2019 Lambda method was used to select the most significant environmental variables that defined each k\u2010means group in a hierarchical way.

A total of 69 taxa were obtained, although species richness was somewhat higher, because we grouped some species at the generic level (e.g. Sericostoma, Wormaldia).

This is related to the difficulties of measuring them and to the lack of a complete phylogeny and phylogeography for the species (Ribera, 2000). Their relative weight depends on the extent of the geographical region used and the presence of strong environmental gradients (see Motzkin et al., 2002).

In some cases, a greater degree of similarity was found between the South of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa than between the South of Iberia and more northern areas (S\u00e1inz\u2010Cantero & Aceituno\u2010Castro, 1997; S\u00e1inz\u2010Cantero, Garrido & Valladares, 1997; Ribera, 2000). The results of our study add to previous knowledge that caddisfly species composition in Mediterranean basins shifts from a dominance of Palearctic species in northern basins to an increasing presence of North African and endemic species in southern basins, with the Segura Basin's mix of species making it the richest of all. Vascular plant records from the Segura region also indicate that it is one of the most diverse regions in the Iberian Peninsula (2000a, 2000b). Similarly, studying aquatic Coleoptera and Heteroptera in the Segura Basin area, Moreno et al. (1997) noticed high richness of taxa with different biogeographical origins. Therefore, considerable evidence indicates the importance of historical factors that occurred at the coming together of Southern Europe and North Africa in explaining terrestrial and aquatic species distributions.",

Our study shows that history itself accounts for up to 3.1% of all variability in caddisfly distributions in the Iberian Mediterranean area. However, despite the relative importance of historical factors and the large scale used in our study, ecological variables better explained caddisfly distribution. There are three possible explanations: (1) contemporary species patterns may have faded with time, because the historical event we are considering occurred long ago and macroinvertebrates, especially many caddisflies, show high dispersion and colonisation capacities (Sheldon, 1984); (2) the effect of history could be masked by the strong environmental gradient in the area (see Robles et al., 2002); and (3) some historical events may influence ecological variables, for example geology. However, although basin geology is related to paleogeographic origin, the result is usually a mixture of calcareous, siliceous and sedimentary materials. Thus, with the environmental variables used to measure basins\u2019 geological composition, we mostly distinguished between materials and not between regions. In addition, most of these environmental factors interact weakly with the historical event in explaining caddisfly distribution, as the fact that only 0.3% of variance is explained by the environment\u2013history interaction shows.",

Combinations of all these significant variables resulted in five groups of sites with their corresponding caddisfly assemblages, which could be explained mainly by geology and longitudinal zonation. All basin variables but only half of the reach and bedform variables were significant in the discriminant analysis. In a study analysing the influence of basin, reach and bedform variables on macroinvertebrates, Townsend et al. (2003) found that large\u2010scale variables were more important than local variables in explaining macroinvertebrate composition in a New Zealand river. In fact, the relative influence of large\u2010scale variables compared with local ones depends on the range of human\u2010modified and natural environmental conditions, the area of study and the predictor used to measure macroinvertebrate communities (e.g. assemblage attributes, relative abundance or presence/absence) (Weigel et al., 2003).",

For example, the significant presence of shredders and woody\u2010cased caddisflies in group 1 [Halesus sp., Chaetopteryx sp., Glyphotaelius pellucidus (Retzius) and Potamophylax spp.] might characterise this group with a higher riparian structure than others in which these species were not significant. Similarly, in midstream reaches of group 4, the best indicator species jointly with those with significant but low indicator values [Cheumatopsyche lepida (Pictet) or R. dorsalis] distinguished different conditions of water quality because the species have differing degrees of tolerance to pollution (Bonada et al., 2004b). In this study, other local factors such as ephemerality [one important characteristic of Mediterranean climate rivers \u2013Gasith & Resh (1999)\u2013 not significant in our study] were associated with several species in the pCCA, such as G. pellucidus in group 1 or S. argentipunctellus and M. aspersus in group 3, but at the same time these species were mixed with other species associated with perennial streams, such as Hydropsyche dinarica Marinkovic\u2013Gospodnetic (Bonada et al., 2004a) or H. infernalis (Ruiz et al., 2001). These trends shown by rare species within the main classification suggest that they may respond to local and subtle factors particular to each group.

Rare taxa are reported in a high proportion in most stream macroinvertebrate studies (Lenat & Resh, 2001). However, although our study included samples collected over four seasons, on calculating the percentage of rare species for each season, the levels we found were much higher (a mean of about 12% higher) than those found in literature dealing with a large set of sites (Wiberg\u2010Larsen et al., 2000; Boyero, 2003). However, a large number of rare taxa may be possible in Mediterranean fauna because of the high diversity and endemicity recorded there, making the area distinctive in biogeographical terms and one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world (Balletto & Casale, 1991; Cowling et al., 1996; Blondel & Aronson, 1999; Myers et al., 2000). In fact, the Iberian Peninsula hosts more caddisfly species than any other part of Europe (390 species in the Iberian Peninsula \u2013 Gonz\u00e1lez, 2003 \u2013 in comparison with, for example, the 198 recorded in the British Isles \u2013Wallace, Wallace & Philipson, 1990; Edington & Hildrew, 1995), but has similar numbers to other countries around the Mediterranean Sea Basin (e.g. Italy, with 381 species \u2013Cianficconi, 2002). However, although Austin & Greig\u2010Smith (1968) found that the percentage of variability explained in principal components analysis dropped on increasing the number of rare taxa included, the numerous rare taxa found in our study did not imply a lower percentage of explained variability by measured environmental factors than in other studies (e.g. 34% of explained variability in Aguiar, Ferreira & Pinto, 2002). Furthermore, explained variability was higher than the values reported by M\u00f8ller & Jennions (2002) (but see Peek et al., 2003) in a meta\u2010analysis study using published data from many different sources, in which it was found that the mean amount of variance explained by the factors used was 2.51\u20135.42%. This would imply that, in spite of the high number of taxa found, they respond to measured variables. Thus, studies involving many rare taxa should include as many environmental variables as possible to ensure good explanation of species variability, since the relationship between rare species and environmental factors is difficult to characterise (Marchant, 2002). In addition, factors such as interactions between organisms, dispersal abilities, or chance, are examples of factors not considered in our study that could reduce the amount of unexplained variability.",
