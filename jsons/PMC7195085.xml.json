It is easy to see it as the thing that is making us ill, not a symptom along with other things like a runny nose or sore throat. \u201cPeople often equate fever with the cause of the fever \u2013 even many doctors struggle to get their heads around that separation of fever being the response to a problem, and not necessarily the problem itself,\u201d says Peters.",

From all these perspectives, it makes sense to want to bring temperatures down as quickly as possible.

In a study of 72 children, those who weren't given drugs known to reduce fever recovered faster. Likewise, a study of 56 people infected with one of the viruses that causes the common cold found that those who took certain fever-reducing drugs remained infectious for longer.",

One reason for this may be that bacteria and viruses find it easier to replicate and infect cells at temperatures below 37\u00b0C. \u201cBy increasing your body temperature, you may be slowing down the ability of a virus to multiply,\u201d says Davis.",

Immune cells that act as first responders to infection, such as dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils, have been shown to arrive at the scene faster, and have an improved capacity to engulf and destroy infectious agents at 38\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. Fever also seems to make these cells better at recruiting and activating T-cells, which coordinate longer-term \u201cadaptive\u201d immune responses, such as antibody production. And T-cells and antibody-producing B-cells also better respond to instructions from the immune system at these temperatures.",

He wanted to explore whether it was feasible to let their temperatures rise as high as 39.5\u00b0C before administering fever-reducing drugs, instead of 38\u00b0C, which is the current practice in most UK hospitals. The children continued to receive other treatment. The trial showed that there were no adverse outcomes from treating at higher temperatures, but it wasn't designed to test if this resulted in faster recovery.",

The question isn't whether we should treat fever, but in which patients we should do it, says Edward Walter, an intensive care doctor at Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, UK, who recently reviewed the medical literature on fever. Rather than seeing it as a single thing, he says that running a high temperature can be a response to various problems. In addition to infection, these include brain injury, heatstroke and taking certain drugs such as ecstasy, so our response to it might need to be more nuanced, he says.",

With pneumonia triggered by a bacterial infection, for instance, antibiotics will often treat the pneumonia, in which case there may be limited benefit to letting a fever run.",

The current advice from the World Health Organization is that either paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to treat symptoms of the illness.
