Over the years, Hong Kong had acted as a \u201cshelter\u201d receiving a large number of natives fleeing from Mainland China in pursuit of political stability and economic opportunities. Hong Kong's economic openness and desire to attain economic security enabled Hong Kong to supply goods and services to the rest of the world. The rise in income and demand was the result of the successful outcome of the supply-driven economic strategy.",

The Central People's Government in Beijing adopted the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d approach in the post-1997 Hong Kong. Since 1985, Hong Kong experienced economic revival and wealth appreciation, but the rapid growth was soon fuelled with speculation in stocks and properties in the early 1990s, resulting in the economic bubble that eventually burst after the outbreak of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) in 1997\u20131998. The economic problem facing the post-AFC Hong Kong economy was structural imbalances with unemployment rate exceeding 7% in 2002. Such short-term fiscal incentives as the creation of temporary employments and assistance to small- and medium-sized industries have been introduced. After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the spring of 2003, additional demand-driven solutions aimed to revive the Hong Kong economy, including the entry of visa-free Mainland travelers and the conclusion of two Closer Economic Partnership Agreements in 2003 and 2004 that permitted tariff-free exports of goods and services to Mainland were introduced. Economic optimism resulting from demand-driven policies has picked up and it is expected that when the new Disney Theme park opens in September 2005, the Hong Kong economy would have recovered considerably.",

The empirical analysis show strongly that structural rigidity rests largely on the non-tradable service sector. For Hong Kong to achieve economic revival, economic recovery is the first step, but resources reallocations to the more competitive tradable industry and service sectors will strengthen Hong Kong's advantage and expand Hong Kong's economic base and capacity. The results clearly show the vulnerability and insufficiency of the demand-drive school, and demonstrate that it would be the successful application of supply-driven policies that could lead the Hong Kong economy to a new stage of achievement.",

The linked exchange rate system can automatically adjust the Hong Kong dollar prices of tradable goods and services. Thus, Hong Kong's tradable sectors remained price competitive despite wage increases. The rise in price of non-tradable sector is simply the result of expansion in the tradable sector, and a strong domestic demand is reflected in the increase in the value-added content of the non-tradable sector. Thirdly, Hong Kong's advantage lies in its ability to provide business clusters that keep Hong Kong competitive despite the low production cost in Southern China. Cost of production becomes secondary if business opportunities are good and profits are made. The international, open and free nature of Hong Kong is itself a powerful competitive edge that few economies in the neighboring economies possess.",

By the mid-1990s, the Hong Kong economy was speculation-led, characterized by a falling level of domestic exports and rising cost. Statistics on wage increase showed that in the period 1981\u20131997, tradable goods have twice experienced a two-digit wage increase in both current and constant price terms, while such non-tradable services as electricity and gas, transportation, and storage and communication, have experienced a total of four or five occasions of two-digit wage increase in both current and constant price terms (Li, 2001). Hong Kong's economic structural rigidity is the result of two separate economic trends (Li, 2002). On the one hand, sharp expansion in speculative activities boosted the nominal economy that merely involved monetary transactions. On the other hand, industrial hollowing and the fall in domestic exports resulted in the shrinkage of real economic activities that involved a reduction in employment, industrial output and exports. When the economic bubble burst, the structural imbalance was exposed when the shrinking real economy could not support the collapse of the nominal economy.",

For example, all hotel services are regarded as producer services, but hotels accommodation is demanded by tours to Hong Kong that are consumer related.

            "text": "This paper raises new questions on the relevance of sector composition in Hong Kong industries. The debate between demand-driven and supply-driven policies can complement each other. A flexible economic structure facilitates the function of the free market. The flexible economic structure means that Hong Kong should pursue supply-side strategies, as the availability of additional resources can attract further demand. In policy terms, this requires the continued investment in infrastructure, investment in human capital and the provision of more resources, typically land resources that can promote the economic capacity of Hong Kong. A long-term strategy that projects a multi-dimension economy is more suitable than to use short-term policies to reduce temporary economic ills, and repetition in the use of short-term policies could deprive the benefits of a long-term policy. Hong Kong cannot be a national economy, but a diversified economic base permits productivity to improve both extensively and intensively.",
