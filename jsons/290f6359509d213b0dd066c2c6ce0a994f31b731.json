            "text": "Dear Editor, we read with great interest the study by Xiao and colleagues [1] on evidence for gastrointestinal infection of COVID-19. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of 73 hospitalized patients resulted in virus detection in 53.4% of subjects, both with and without gastrointestinal manifestations (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding). In addition, COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive in faeces of 23.3% of patients in which respiratory samples had already turned negative. Stool positivity after respiratory sample switched negative had already been reported by Tang et al [2] . As the Authors stated, these findings support a possible role of faecal-oral transmission and suggest the need of enhanced control measures especially during the convalescence period of infected patients.",

            "text": "However, the reported data have also other potential consequences that deserve further investigations. First, stool sampling could be a complementary, non-invasive test for initial diagnosis. Currently, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs is the recommended modality for etiological diagnosis [3] . However, false-negative are documented and can be responsible of misdiagnoses or missed isolation of sources of infection [4] [5] . Even if the study by Xiao and colleagues evaluated only patients with positive throat swabs, stool sampling could be effective for detecting viral load even in patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs. Large-scale studies would be useful to determine accuracy of this non-invasive test. Furthermore, with the growing spread of COVID-19 infection, concerns should raise on how to guarantee safety for Endoscopy operators. Undetected cases (asymptomatic patients or during the latency period) could undergo endoscopy for many indications. Currently, local authorities from a high-incidence area in Italy recommend the use of extraordinary personal protective equipment (PPE) only for micro-aerosol generating procedures, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, unrecognized exposure to potentially infectious biologic samples during endoscopy is well documented [5] ; thus, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools, as found in the present study, could lead to a not negligible risk of transmission also for colonoscopy in endemic areas, especially in absence of additional protection measures. Dedicated PPE should be provided to all clinical staff.",
