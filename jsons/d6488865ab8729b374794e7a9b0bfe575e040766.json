Children aged 6 to 59 months who presented to a tertiary pediatric hospital between influenza seasons 2008 and 2012 with fever and acute respiratory symptoms were enrolled, and nasal samples were collected. Respiratory viruses were identified by culture and polymerase chain reaction. We compared demographics, presenting symptoms, and clinical outcomes of children with a single-virus infection and those in whom 2 or more viruses were detected (virus-virus codetection). We used logistic regression models and estimated marginal means to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and probabilities of symptom presentation, prescription of antibiotics, and hospitalization.",

Two or more viruses were detected in 25% of these children. After we adjusted for demographic factors, children with virus-virus codetection had greater odds of presenting with cough (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.1) and rhinorrhea (aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9) than those with a single-virus infection, although both symptoms were common. Children with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus combined had the highest probability of hospitalization (55%; 95% CI, 35%-73%), which was significantly greater than for those with influenza infection alone (22%; 95% CI, 16%-29%).",

Therefore, routine screening for virus-virus codetection in this population should be restricted to those with common respiratory pathogens, and efforts to reduce cross infection should focus on these specific pathogens.",
