This report describes air-leak syndrome and obstructive uropathy occurring simultaneously in a teenage patient affected by SJS. Case presentation: A 17-year-old Malay female with SJS suffered from bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, and obstructive uropathy as early complications of her disease. She required intubation, chest tube insertion, and bilateral ureteric stenting as part of her intensive care management. These extracutaneous complications of renal and pulmonary systems were likely secondary to widespread epithelial detachment. Conclusion: Despite paucity of cases in adult literature, post-renal causes for acute kidney injury must be considered in SJS, especially in the setting of gross haematuria. Bedside point-of-care ultrasonography may be a useful tool for excluding obstructive uropathy. Pneumothorax is a rare but documented complication of SJS in paediatric cases and, to a lesser extent, adult patients. Extra care should be exercised when caring for mechanically ventilated patients suffering from SJS.",

These clinical and histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Severity of illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN score) on admission was 2. The trigger for her SJS remains uncertain. ALDEN scoring for all drugs was \u2212 3; onset of red eye symptom was taken as probable index day [1] .

Twenty-four hours later, at the end of day 3 of admission, she developed sudden onset severe respiratory distress with desaturation and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Clinical examination demonstrated extensive subcutaneous emphysema. Chest X-ray confirmed presence of right-sided pneumothorax, small left-sided pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum (Fig. 6, left) . A chest tube was inserted for the right-sided pneumothorax. Pneumomediastinum and contralateral pneumothorax remained stable on several follow-up images throughout the hospital stay, including CT scan for characterisation (Fig. 6 , right).

Although case reports suggest that a single dose co-amoxiclav is sufficient for eruption [2] , application of a stringent definition of \"probable index day\" shows that her SJS process had likely already started prior to medication exposure [3] . Rather, prescription of co-amoxiclav and symptomatic medications were reflective of prodromal symptoms of SJS that were already marking disease onset (protopathic bias) [4] . SJS is driven by cytotoxic T cell destruction of the epidermis. T cells produce cytolytic proteins such as granulysin. The link between drug/infectious agent exposure and T cell-mediated destruction of the epidermis remains poorly delineated. Therapeutic principles for management of SJS include removal of culprit agent, multi-disciplinary care of the patient, and transfer of patient to tertiary care in severe cases. Meticulous daily attention to involved mucosal surfaces, pain requirements, fluid demands, thromboprophylaxis, and calorific requirements are the tenets of ICU care. Active therapy may be instigated as part of expert multi-disciplinary decision making. We point readers to current guidelines for further reading [5] .",

Notably, in a 4-year-long retrospective series of 221 adult cases of SJS where chest radiographs were monitored as part of the study protocol, there was not a single record of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum [18] . A Japanese 6-year registry of adult and paediatric cases of SJS described mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema as observed complications, but did not comment upon the incidence of air-leak nor age of patients involved [19] . Literature search yielded only seven reported cases of air-leak; the majority are paediatric cases [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , with only one case described in a young adult [26] . Air leak presented as pneumomediastinum in all of these cases, with subcutaneous emphysema documented in six of the seven cases. Pneumothorax was described in three cases only: unilateral in two cases and bilateral in one case.",

Pneumomediastinum is then the consequence of released alveolar air dissecting through the pulmonary interstitium along the broncho-vascular sheaths toward the pulmonary hila, into the mediastinum [27] . This hypothesis may also explain the predominance of paediatric cases due to smaller calibre airways. Forceful coughing due to hypersecretion and irritation from bronchial denudement may also contribute to alveolar rupture. Our patient had thick bronchorrhea and difficulty managing her secretions prior to respiratory deterioration. Bronchorrhea in the setting of SJS is described as clear yellow fluid, without the presence of any bronchial casts and may represent part of the exudative process of SJS rather than secondary to denudement [17] . Mechanical ventilation could be a contributing factor in our patient, although previously published case reports had air leak at presentation to hospital and therefore unrelated to the onset of mechanical ventilation. In the only other published adult case report of pneumomediastinum/ pneumothorax in SJS, air leak occurred prior to the onset of mechanical ventilation [26] .",
