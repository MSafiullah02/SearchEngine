As a postdoctoral fellow in Michael Diamond\u2019s laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis, my research focused on another flavivirus, West Nile virus (WNV), particularly the roles of different interferon subtypes in restricting viral neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. But after 5 years in the Diamond Laboratory, I was on the job market and looking for open areas of research where I could distinguish myself as a new investigator.",

            "text": "The emergence of new pathogens (and re-emergence of old ones) is a constant theme in arbovirus research, as travel and commerce move infected humans, animals, and arthropod vectors into new areas. Examples in recent decades include the introduction of WNV to North America in 1999; independent introductions of chikungunya virus to Southern Europe in 2007 and to the Western Hemisphere in 2013; and the spread of Schmallenberg virus across Europe since 2011. This is not a new phenomenon (the trans-Atlantic slave trade brought yellow fever virus to the Americas in the 17th century) but modern travel has expedited it, and climate change is likely to expand the geographic areas affected. I wanted to be prepared to study the next emerging arbovirus, and I did not have to look far to see evidence that this approach could pay off: my own postdoctoral mentor had started his laboratory at Wash U in 2001, just as WNV was making its way westward across the United States. Although Mike had planned for his new lab to work on dengue virus, the focus of his postdoctoral training, he was able to adapt this expertise to an emerging flavivirus, quickly becoming a leader in the field. More recently, what had started as a minor research area in the Diamond Laboratory, chikungunya virus, had gained new relevance when this virus was introduced to the Caribbean in 2013 (Diamond, 2015, Racaniello, 2016).",

To get started, I requested a sample of Usutu virus from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). While I was at it, I also requested some other potential emerging flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV). This virus was even more obscure than Usutu virus (almost no experimental science published), but it was causing outbreaks in the South Pacific, so had potential to spread further.",

Fortunately, we were able to draw on our extensive experience studying other flaviviruses in mice. Knowing that WNV causes lethal disease in wild-type (C57BL/6) mice but that dengue virus replicates very poorly even in highly immunodeficient mice, I infected both wild-type mice and ones with defective antiviral responses. These included mice that cannot respond to interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) (Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212), mice that lack transcription factors required for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Irf5\n\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Irf7\n\u2212/\u2212), and mice with defective pattern recognition receptor signaling (Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212), all of which succumb rapidly to WNV infection (Lazear et al., 2013, Suthar et al., 2010). We eventually tested at least 18 different mouse lines at different ages with a variety of ZIKV strains, doses, and inoculation routes. Among weaned mice (3 weeks and older), we only observed morbidity or mortality in lines that lacked an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response (Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212, Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Ifngr1\n\u2212/\u2212, or Irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Irf5\n\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Irf7\n\u2212/\u2212), consistent with what other groups have since reported (Aliota et al., 2016, Dowall et al., 2016, Rossi et al., 2016, Yockey et al., 2016).",

Realizing that ZIKV was a much more significant human pathogen than we had initially appreciated, we felt a new sense of urgency to publish our mouse infection data, since small animal models are incredibly valuable for understanding mechanisms of viral pathogenesis as well as evaluating potential vaccines and therapeutics. However, in my new laboratory I did not yet have pipettes or a freezer, let alone the large colony of knockout mice that would be necessary to complete this paper. I am grateful to members of the Diamond Laboratory, including Jonathan Miner, Amber Smith, and Jennifer Govero, who expended tremendous effort to complete additional experiments in record time. They infected hundreds of immunodeficient mice with different ZIKV strains, watching and waiting to see whether any additional lines would succumb to infection. They detected high viral titers in tissues such as the brain and testes that we now think are important for ZIKV pathogenesis. They also demonstrated that ZIKV can replicate in wild-type mice administered an IFNAR1-blocking monoclonal antibody, resulting in high viremia (though not lethality). Subsequent work in the Diamond laboratory by Jonathan, Jennifer, and others demonstrated that this increase in viremia is enough to elicit key ZIKV disease presentations including transplacental transmission, ophthalmological pathology, and damage to the testes with a concomitant decrease in male fertility (Govero et al., 2016, Miner et al., 2016a, Miner et al., 2016b). Although there are inherent limitations to studying viral pathogenesis in the absence of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, having small animal models that replicate severe manifestations of ZIKV infection is important for developing interventions and for understanding the basic biology of ZIKV. Thanks to the effort and dedication of everyone involved, we were able to submit our paper to Cell Host and Microbe in March 2016 (Lazear et al., 2016). The urgency surrounding ZIKV research was reflected in the paper\u2019s rapid turnaround: the revised version was accepted 10 days later. Unbeknownst to us, Rossi and colleagues had already submitted a report of ZIKV infection in Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice to the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (Rossi et al., 2016); when we first saw their publication (on the day ours was accepted), we knew this was the beginning of a deluge of ZIKV publications.",

When I told Mike that I was pregnant, he asked that I stop doing BSL-3 sharps work, due to the risk of a needlestick exposure. Nearly all of my experiments involved infecting mice with WNV and harvesting their tissues, so it was no small request when Mike asked another postdoctoral fellow in the lab to do these experiments for me. I was shocked and felt that my project was being taken away, and it was embarrassing to be burdening someone else in the lab with my work. Ironically, this postdoc was herself pregnant, though she had not yet revealed this to Mike or to the rest of the laboratory. She continued to do her experiments and mine, and my experience discouraged her from disclosing her pregnancy any earlier than necessary. Two years later, when I was pregnant with my second child, we decided not to change any of my experimental procedures. My experience left me sensitive to the complex motivations involved in these decisions, particularly for a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow with an intellectual and emotional investment in a project. Now that I am a Principal Investigator, I have come to appreciate that the risks I might knowingly take upon myself exceed those that I would accept for my trainees.

            "text": "When considering the proper policies to adopt for ZIKV research, our IBC\u2019s questions ranged from the risks of a splash exposure to whether I would be nimble enough to catch an escaped mouse. We ultimately agreed on a system of enhanced information and consent for all laboratory workers, additional warning signs, and accommodations for women who declined to work with ZIKV. We decided that cell culture work was low-risk under routine BSL-2 containment and that the main exposure risk was needlesticks. Therefore, pregnant women would be advised to avoid sharps work with ZIKV. These precautions were reasonable and enabled my new laboratory to begin work on most of our ZIKV research projects but left me unable to do the mouse infections that were my primary expertise; I owe many thanks to Ken Plante, then a postdoctoral fellow in Mark Heise\u2019s laboratory, who stepped up to infect mice with ZIKV while I could not. The irony, given the measures we took to find someone from another lab to assist me with sharps work, was that I had spent the earliest part of my pregnancy injecting ZIKV into as many mice as possible (at least 157 by my records), frantically trying to generate data before leaving Wash U. Of course, none of us had heard of microcephaly then. As the evidence for Congenital Zika Syndrome grew, along with indications that the first trimester may be an especially vulnerable time for infection, I was thankful that I had no reason to think that I had had an exposure during those early experiments. My healthy baby was born in June 2016 and 10 days later he was the youngest attendee (I presume) at the American Society for Virology meeting at Virginia Tech (see Figure 1\n), where I convened one of the late-breaking sessions on ZIKV and presented our work developing a mouse model of ZIKV pathogenesis.",

However, I do think that my experience has made me especially aware of the privilege I had to avoid exposure to ZIKV while I was pregnant, which sadly is not an option for many women in ZIKV endemic areas. This highlights the need for a vaccine to prevent ZIKV infection, as well as better data about the factors that mediate transplacental transmission and the long-term prognosis for children exposed to ZIKV in utero, along with access to comprehensive family planning services (including contraception and abortion) so that women confronted with ZIKV exposure can make informed decisions.",

There are also technical hurdles to overcome for the development of serological diagnostics and an effective vaccine. The importance of these questions has attracted researchers with diverse expertise; studying Zika virus has provided an exciting opportunity to work with colleagues in neuroscience, developmental biology, and maternal-fetal medicine, as well as other virologists and immunologists. I have had the great fortune to be starting my new lab at UNC among incredibly supportive neighbors and colleagues who have made it possible for my laboratory to move our ZIKV research forward, even before I was able to get all of our equipment and assays up and running. My laboratory has broad and ongoing interests in ZIKV pathogenesis, including the impact of genetic changes between historical and contemporary ZIKV strains on pathogenesis; the innate immune mechanisms that control viral invasion across anatomical barriers; and the impact of host genetics and prior flavivirus immunity on susceptibility to ZIKV disease. Mouse infection systems, and particularly the model we reported in our Cell Host & Microbe paper in 2016, are proving to be key resources for addressing these and other questions in ZIKV research.",
