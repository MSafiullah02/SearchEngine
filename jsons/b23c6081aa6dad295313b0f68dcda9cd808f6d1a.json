The outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 by the World Health Organization. The dramatically raising number of general population and health care professionals infected in Western countries is profoundly changing daily clinical practice. Resources of health care systems across Europe and globally have been temporarily reallocated to cope with the pandemic. As no vaccine is effective to date, social distancing has been promoted in order to decrease the diffusion and reduce the preventable deaths from overloading the public health system. All nonurgent procedures such as elective surgery and diagnostic testing have been markedly impacted. In this particular environment, the lack of availability of operating theaters, endoscopic suites and infusion sessions, radiation planning, or planned hospital admissions has forced the entire oncologic community to carefully consider how to deliver best care to cancer patients during this crisis.",

Cancer patients are vulnerable, and the balance between fear of immunosuppression, with the threat of COVID-19, and a compromised cancer outcome due to either delays in treatment or the use of suboptimal alternatives is a matter of great concern taking place daily in MDTs throughout the world. The Chinese experience to date highlights these concerns, in particular the added risk of Infection due to cancer-associated or treatment-induced therapy, as well as poorer outcomes from infection itself with higher risk of severe events. Patients who underwent chemotherapy (CT) or surgery in the prior month had a clinically severe form in 75% of cases, with an odds ratio of 5.34 (95% confidence interval 1\u00b780-16\u00b718; P = 0\u00b70026). 1 Therefore, the risk of acquiring COVID-19, and its implications with respect to mortality in particular, is highly relevant at this time in treatment planning and informed consent. 2",

Moreover, the rate of postoperative major respiratory complications is high, at approximately 25%; hence, a severe acute respiratory syndrome, from COVID-19, would present a major risk to life, particularly if respiratory and intensive care resources were unavailable or suboptimal. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] A key question consequently, uncertain at this time, is the timing of progression of an esophageal cancer that can be treated with curative intent from the initial clinical presentation and staging. We acknowledge the insufficiency of data on this topic and suggest that doubling time and metastatic potential is likely to be highly variable across the spectrum of tumor biology seen in esophageal cancers, and most estimates in this context are speculative.",

The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) adds that therapies that have been considered standard of care should be reconsidered. ESTRO also gives some guidance about the modification of radiotherapy treatments under a tumor-type basis in their recent publication. In respect of esophagogastric tumors, while gastric tumors should be treated with CT only, esophageal tumors in the view of the ESTRO should be treated by 'resection or CRT rather than trimodality therapy.' 18 To apply these recommendations, it would appear that starting or extending CRT for localized esophageal tumors (including cT2N0 stages) should be a valid option to consider for these patients, this is also consistent with the French proposal. 15 If services are disrupted, patients should be prioritized for treatment accordingly, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline's prioritization system is a useful resource in this scenario. 19",
