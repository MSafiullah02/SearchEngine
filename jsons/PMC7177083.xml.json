Several programs developed strategies to reduce inpatient adolescent admissions, including refining eating disorder admission criteria. Several programs discussed that they had implemented protocols that allowed for more rapid refeeding. These changes, combined with a reduction of patients presenting to the hospital, resulted in significant reductions in the inpatient census at these institutions. To preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and promote social distancing, inpatient consultations in some institutions were being conducted by telehealth or phone. In some programs, hospitalized patients on COVID precautions were given specially programmed tablets to communicate directly with nurses and medical staff, thereby preserving PPE. Across institutions, reduced numbers of team members participated in in-person patient care, with a focus on limiting in-person visits to those that involved performing a physical examination. Similarly, numbers of people involved in in-person patient care conferences was limited, and social distancing was addressed with chair spacing. Several programs had developed strategies for direct admission for eating disorder patients to reduce risk for emergency room exposure. Some hospitals had adopted strategies to increase regional adult bed capacity, including closing community pediatric wards and directing all pediatric admissions to the children\u2019s hospital, or admitting young adult patients to the children\u2019s hospital.",

Several programs had established daily morning \u201cVital Sign Clinics\u201d where patients would come in for heart rate, blood pressure and weight assessment that was either followed by, or preceded by, a telehealth visit. Some programs were enlisting parents to monitor vital signs, including teaching parents to take pulses, using \u201cfit bit\u201d pulse features, and assessing weights on home scales. A few programs had developed triage mechanisms by experienced clinicians and mechanisms to offer in-person visits to a select group of new patients based on medical or mental/behavioral health criteria for urgency. In some programs, new eating disorder visits for patients with less urgent needs were being co-managed with primary care providers until safe in-person visits could be arranged, and programs were in the process of developing strategies to initiate care using telehealth.

We provide care to many AYA populations with comorbid physical and mental/behavioral health issues, as well as those who are physically healthy but have substantial mental/behavioral health needs. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it is causing in young people\u2019s lives will likely have ongoing impact for all young people.5 We need to be actively engaged in identifying opportunities to support the mental health and well-being of young people through these challenging times.",
