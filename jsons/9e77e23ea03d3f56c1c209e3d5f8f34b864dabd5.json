Except for 37 severe or critically ill patients, the rest of the 157 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 190 (97.94%) patients were confirmed during the three times nucleic acid test. The main clinical symptom of the patients were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 30 patients (15.46%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 141 patients (72.68%) showed abnormal density shadow, while 53 cases (27.32%) had no obvious abnormality in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 109 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and 9 patients died. The ACE2 expression levels were up-regulated in patients of severe type and critically ill type. Conclusion Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and CT imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19. ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19.",

At present, patients with COVID-19 are the main source of infection through respiratory droplets and contact [18, 19] . Clinically, patients with SARS had a triphasic pattern of disease, including fever, a nonproductive cough, sore throat, and myalgia [20] . In the present study, patients with COVID-19 had [21] . However, we found that the ACE2 protein levels were up-regulated in severe type and critically ill type compared with the adjacent normal tissue of lung, especially in critically ill type. This result demonstrates that ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19. Recently, Hoffmann et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor [22] . They also reveal the important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention, because there is no specific drug for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 now.",
