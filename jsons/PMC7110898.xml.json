Different IBV strains may be responsible for distinct illnesses. Based on virus neutralisation (VN) tests, IBV exists as dozens of serotypes. Although vaccines have generally been used in controlling the clinical disease, infectious bronchitis (IB) outbreaks occur frequently owing to the antigenic differences between serotypes (Arvidson et al., 1991, Bochkov et al., 2006, Cook et al., 2001, Gelb et al., 1981, Gelb et al., 2005, Hofstad, 1981, Ladman et al., 2006, Marquardt et al., 1982) and the development of vaccines from local field isolates is necessary for control.",

            "text": "It is well known that the spike (S) protein of IBV induces antibodies for VN and haemagglutination inhibition (Cavanagh, 2007). The S glycoprotein is proteolitically processed into two non-covalently bound peptide chains known as S1 and S2 (Stein and Sefton, 1982). The S1 protein of IBV has serotype-specific and neutralisation-specific epitopes, and serotypic evolution and the genetic diversity of IBV are mainly monitored by analysis of the S1 gene. As might be expected, cross-protection tends to diminish as the degree of amino acid identity between the S1 proteins of two IBV strains decreases (Cavanagh et al., 1997, Gelb et al., 2005). It has been reported that comparing IBV S1 gene sequences is a better predictor of immune response to challenge in chickens than serotyping by VN (Ladman et al., 2006), and gene sequence comparisons were used in these studies for virus typing. However, VN is probably a more practical method in terms of control strategies for performing protection studies (protectotype) with the field isolates (Cook et al., 1999).",

Proventriculitis was observed in in vivo pathogenicity experiments, but no kidney swelling was observed (Yu et al., 2001a). These data suggested that the three isolates might be a new emerging IBV variant associated with the alimentary tract, especially the proventriculus (Yu et al., 2001a). We have also previously isolated IBV isolates (CK/CH/LDL/97I-type) between 1997 and 2001, indicating that this type of IBV has continued to circulate in vaccinated and non-vaccinated chicken flocks in recent years. However, as observed previously (Liu et al., 2007) and in the present study, only mild proventriculitis was observed in a few sick chicks and gross lesions were mainly confined to the kidneys. This is similar to the case with a Taiwan IBV isolate, 2992/02, belonging to the CK/CH/LDL/97I-type by S1 gene comparison (Huang et al., 2004). The nephropathogenic 2992/02 strain was isolated from a Ma5-vaccinated broiler farm built near the migratory bird wetland in Yilan in Taiwan in 2002 (Huang et al., 2004).

CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains clearly belonged to different clusters in comparison to the reference strains (Fig. 1), suggesting that the CK/CH/LDL/97-type strains may differ genotypically not only with the selected vaccine strains, but also with other types of IBVs circulating in China.

However, in most cases, it is reported that IBV isolates with high S1 homology induce a high degree of cross-protection. Accordingly, IBV strains with low S1 homology provide little or inconsistent cross-protection (Cavanagh, 1997, Ladman et al., 2006). Little S1 similarity between CK/CH/LDL/97I and the vaccine strains in this study could explain the poor clinical and respiratory protection conferred against CK/CH/LDL/97I challenge in the chickens vaccinated with heterologous viruses. This might be why the birds from which CK/CH/LDL/971-like isolates were recovered developed disease in spite of being vaccinated with IBV vaccines (Liu et al., 2006b, Yu et al., 2001a).",

This was determined by re-isolation of the virus from kidneys 5 days post-challenge and is a useful tool in evaluating protection conferred by IBV commercial vaccines against IBV challenge (Alvarado et al., 2003). It was shown that circulating antibody levels were of minor importance in the protection of the respiratory mucosa against challenge (Hofstad, 1967, Holmes, 1973, Macdonald et al., 1981). However, nephritis can be induced by infection of the respiratory tract presumably following viraemia. Although circulating antibody against IBV played only a minor role in protection of the respiratory tract, humoral immune mechanisms directed against viraemia appeared to be of particular importance in protecting the kidney (Holmes, 1973, Macdonald et al., 1981, Marquardt et al., 1982). All of the vaccinated birds showed seroconversion after 20 days post-inoculation and this antibody contributed to protection of kidneys against the nephropathogenic CK/CH/LDL/97I challenge.",
