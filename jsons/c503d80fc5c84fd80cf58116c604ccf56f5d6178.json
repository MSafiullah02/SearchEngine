The purpose of understanding the interactions between microbiota, virus, and host is to identify practical, effective, and safe approaches that target microbiota for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases in humans and animals, as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available. The initial step for achieving this goal is to gather clinical evidences, focusing on the viral pathogens-from human and animal studies-that have already been shown to interact with microbiota. The subsequent step is to identify mechanisms, through experimental evidences, to support the development of translational applications that target microbiota. In this chapter, we review evidences of virus infections altering microbiota and of microbiota enhancing or suppressing infectivity, altering host susceptibility to certain viral diseases, and influencing vaccine immunogenicity in humans and farm animals.

This new field of research on microbiomevirus-host interaction is made possible by the massive advances in the nucleotide sequencing approaches, metagenomic analysis and data mining, and bioinformatics analytical software. 3, 4 Most available data on the microbiome describe the gut microbiota; however, microbiota is pertinent not only to enteric viral diseases, but also to viral diseases that affect every organ and system in the body. Although the majority of the microbiota resides in the gut, there are large populations that also reside in the mouth, urinary tract and on the skin. [5] [6] [7] Most principles learned from the study of gut microbiome apply to microbial habitats throughout the body. The study of microbiota-virus-host interactions in each specific location of the body allows the understanding of localized immunity and susceptibility to invading viruses and how the local microbiota factor into these processes.",

Up to one-half million deaths occur annually, with close to five million reported cases. 45 The best defense thus far is the yearly strain-specific vaccine.

All five of these groups differed significantly in their relative abundance of 15 different bacterial genera. 2 When looking at the implications of certain taxa within the NOP CSTs on susceptibility to influenza, results showed a negative association between Bacteroidetes and NOP CST 4, of which the highest relative abundance was both Streptococcus and Neisseria, on host susceptibility to influenza infection. A positive correlation was noted between Alloprevotella and Prevotella and infection susceptibility. 43 Lee et al. also demonstrated notable differences in the microbiome of people of different ages in regards to concurrent influenza infection. Of the NOP CSTs defined in the study, NOP CST 4, which was associated with a decreased vulnerability to influenza infection, was not as abundant or stable in children and showed a consistent increase in prevalence with increased age of a given participant. 2 This suggests the greater occurrence of influenza among young children can be attributed to immature and underdeveloped microbial networks in the nose/throat. 2 The microbiome of the nasopharynx may also play a role in severity of disease and the development of secondary bacterial infections related to influenza. Ding et al. showed that both influenza A and B infected individuals had a nasopharynx microbiome containing taxa such as Dolosigranulum and Staphylococcus. 8 These genera have been correlated with the development of pneumonia, a common sequela of influenza in elderly patients, and Dolosigranulum also has been identified as a causative agent in septicemia. [47] [48] [49] This study classified nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from infected and healthy subjects into four different NP types. NP type A was most prevalent in influenza-infected patients, and consisted of the two bacteria mentioned above. 8 NP type B was significantly enriched in the healthy control group and was dominated by Corynebacterium, NP type C was dominated by Moraxella, and NP type D had a high prevalence of Staphylococcus. 8 Corynebacterium has been shown to hinder Streptococcus pneumoniae growth in vitro and has been demonstrated to be abundant in children lacking S. pneumoniae nasal colonization. 9 Corynebacterium has also been shown to have antimicrobial effects against S. aureus. 50 The discoveries made in the study conducted by Ding et al. support the previously mentioned study's findings, with NP type B being dominated by Corynebacterium with relatively low levels of Staphylococcus. 8 These results reiterate the need for more focused studies on the therapeutic potentials of certain bacteria among microbiota and how they can alter vulnerable patient outcomes.",

            "text": "A recent study using a mouse model of influenza virus infection has shown that fermentable dietary fiber increased survival of influenza-infected mice by dampening airway inflammation through several immune modulating mechanisms. 10 Dietary fiber inulin altered the intestinal microbiota in mice and exhibited butyrogenic properties. In inulin-treated mice, the microbiome structure was significantly improved, and beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including Bifidobacteriaceae, became dominant. Inulin or SCFAs intake prevented excessive neutrophil influx into the airways by blunting the levels of CXCL1 produced by lung monocytes and macrophages. In addition, inulin and SCFAs increased antiviral immunity through CD8 + T cell activation. 10 Another study in a mouse model of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) reported similar findings that fermentable dietary fiber can reduce virus replication, protect the lungs against inflammation and pathological changes induced by RSV infection through microbiota-derived acetate in mice. 51 Since fermentable dietary fiber play a role in regulating immunity by promoting the growth of SCFA-producing bacteria, taking fermentable dietary fiber and reducing the excessive immune response and lung pathology caused by the viruses are a causal relationship, not just a correlation. To date, there are no human clinical studies on using fermentable dietary fiber to prevent influenza or other respiratory viral infection or to reduce the disease severity. This area of translational research warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization, 1.7 million new HIV cases occurred globally in 2018, and nearly 38 million people currently are living with the infection. 52 This disease typically is spread through sexual contact, and the disruption of cervicovaginal microbiota has been correlated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection. 53 Investigation of the cervicovaginal microbiota's influence on HIV infection susceptibility could lead to the development of therapeutic agents for preventing HIV in especially at-risk communities, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 24 million people are infected, and young women are eight times more likely than men to acquire the virus. 13 Though the majority of the human microbiota resides in the gut, the cervix and vagina maintain their own commensal microbial communities. 13 A cervicovaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus, specifically L. crispatus, is associated with many health benefits, including reduced risk of contracting HIV. 52 When cervicovaginal dysbiosis occurs, Lactobacillus communities are disrupted and other resident microbes, such as Gardnerella or Mobiluncus, become the predominant species, resulting in bacterial vaginosis. 11 A study conducted by Fredricks et al. demonstrated increased bacterial diversity in women with bacterial vaginosis, and a relatively \"normal\" vaginal flora dominated by L. crispatus in women without the disease. 11 A HIV study by Gosmann et al. showed that none of the participants who contracted HIV had a cervicovaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus prior to infection. 13 They also demonstrated that women who maintained the most diverse microbiome were significantly more likely to contract HIV than those with less diverse communities dominated by L. crispatus. 13 These results are consistent with the notion that a Lactobacillus dominated cervicovaginal microbiota for the prevention of HIV is critical. Several anaerobic bacteria also were implicated in the increased susceptibility to HIV infection in this study, including Prevotella and Sneathia. 13 These bacteria were shown to increase inflammation in the genital tract, further decreasing the participants' immune robustness against HIV infection. 13 Bacterial vaginosis and high diversity/low L. crispatus presence in the vagina has been associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection, partly due to resulting genital inflammation and the vulnerability of cell types that dominate the inflamed genital tract. 12, 54 Genital inflammation has been shown to lead to disturbances in the vaginal epithelium, making women especially susceptible to HIV infection. 13, 54 Anahtar et al. found that a diverse cervicovaginal microbiota is strongly linked to genital inflammation, including an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. 12 Fusobacterium, Aerococcus, Sneathia, Gemella, Mobiluncus, and Prevotella were all found to have a significant association with an increase in inflammatory cytokines. 12 These results were confirmed in vitro when human epithelial cells co-cultured with these bacteria, specifically Prevotella amnii, Mobiluncus mulieris, Sneathia amnii, and Sneathia sanguinegens were shown to have a marked increase in cytokine secretion than those co-cultured with L. crispatus, which showed no detectable levels of cytokine secretion. 12 Women with increased proinflammatory cytokine levels attributed to highly diverse cervicovaginal microbiota also had higher levels of CD4+ T cells, one of HIV's main target cells, establishing a strong link between increased bacterial diversity and an increased risk of contracting HIV. 12 Along with cervicovaginal microbiota diversity and the implications it has on HIV status and pathogenesis, gut microbiota diversity has also been identified as playing a significant role in these areas in regards to HIV. Because HIV is known to replicate in gut lymphoid tissues, it is relevant to discuss the implications the disruption of the gut microbiota and subsequent inflammation may have on HIV pathogenesis and vice versa. 55 HIV has been previously associated with gut dysbiosis, and again represents a potential tool that can be used to mitigate the impact of HIV infection. 56 In a meta-analysis performed by Tuddenham et al., it was demonstrated that diversity of the microbiome in HIV-1 positive individuals was significantly decreased prior to controlling using demographic categories. 56 When controlling for sexual preferences and gender, this held true for men who have sex with women (MSW) as well as men. 56 Men who have sex with men (MSM) showed no significant association with microbiota diversity and HIV status; however, when controlling for MSM, HIV positive men were more likely to have a decreased diversity than HIV positive women. 56 This study highlights the complicated relationship between many factors involved in HIV infection, including diversity of the microbiota. In future studies, it will be beneficial to investigate the role the other factors play in diversity and how therapeutics can be tailored based on factors like gender and sexual preference.",

[58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Several factors contribute to the enhancement of HIV infection, including cervicovaginal and gut dysbiosis. The resulting inflammatory and immune-related sequelae can have significant impact on the progression and outcome of the disease. The prevention and management of HIV infection in developed countries has improved dramatically since the first cases were reported in the 1980s; however, there are still millions of people in underdeveloped areas who would benefit from microbiota research in regards to HIV prevention. 52 The findings in the above studies show promise for the development of accessible and personalized medicine alternative to help these areas recover from a several decades long HIV epidemic.",

Due to the ease of transmission, cases of HuNoV tend to be concentrated and typically are more problematic in children, especially in low-income regions. 63 In more developed countries, HuNoV is known to cause outbreaks of gastroenteritis in all age groups. 63 HuNoV is of great concern in public health practice, but due to the lack of reliable and well-established in vitro cell culture systems, the development of therapeutics has been slow. 66 Certain microbial populations can positively contribute to gut health and microbial balance, and one of the most intriguing benefits of these bacteria is their ability to influence outcomes of infectious diseases. 67 When the gut microbiota is disrupted, the protection potential is diminished and the host becomes susceptible to numerous infections. 14,67 Nelson et al. conducted a study whose results suggest that HuNoV infections are capable of causing significant alterations in human gut microbiota. 14 In this study, 20% of HuNoV-infected subjects showed significant changes in their gut microbiota, including an increase in Proteobacteria populations, especially Escherichia coli, and a decreased bacterial diversity. 14 Proteobacteria are associated with gut microbiota disruption, further suggesting the study participants had a disrupted microbiota at the time of sampling. 14 These patients were identified as being at risk for developing postinfection disease, such as irritable bowel syndrome. 68 ",

            "text": "infection Along with establishing the need for a stable gut microbiota as a natural defense against HuNoV infection, other studies have identified a potential link between human genetic signatures, such as histo-blood group antigen (HBGA), specifically secretor status, the gut microbiome, and their combined influence on immunity to HuNoV infection. Secretor status of an individual is determined by the functionality of the FUT2 gene, which is responsible for producing an enzyme critical to generating glycans present in saliva and mucus. 69 These glycans can serve as an infection initiating binding site of certain HuNoV strains. 69 When both alleles of this gene are altered and nonfunctional, a person is deemed a non-secretor. 69 Nonsecretors have been shown to be highly resistant to symptomatic HuNoV infections due to the mutation in the FUT2 gene, which diminishes the norovirus's ability to bind to receptors in the intestine, thus preventing HuNoV from entering cells and causing infection. 69 Several studies also have shown secretor status to be linked to microbiota composition. 15, 70 In a study by Rodriguez-Diaz et al., human patients were shown to have a correlation between their gut microbiota diversity, secretor status and susceptibility to HuNoV infection. 15 Host anti-HuNoV salivary IgA titers were obtained from the participants and were used as an indicator of previous infection susceptibility. 15 Though no significant differences in phyla composition of the gut (obtained through stool samples) and secretor status were found, significant family-level differences were present between nonsecretors and secretors; with significantly higher levels of Prevotellaceae and Paraprevotellaceae found in non-secretors. 15 The study then involved separating the obvious groupings into operational taxonomic groups (OTUs) and were then analyzed for diversity levels. Sixteen of the more than 5000 groups were found to have significant differences, and consisted of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, found in non-secretors. There were also significant differences in richness of the sampled microbiota, though they were not significant in regards to secretors versus non-secretors. 15 Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were the most abundant phyla categorized from both secretors and non-secretors. This study also found anti-HuNoV IgA levels were significantly correlated with secretor versus non-secretor status, with secretors maintaining higher levels of the two groups. 15 The viral infectivity and host susceptibility to HuNoV was negatively correlated to the level of Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium present in host samples. When these insights are combined with the negative correlation between anti-norovirus IgA titers and susceptibility to HuNoV infection, the notion that host microbiome, secretor status and susceptibility are all reliant on each other to some extent is apparent. 15 More thorough research is needed to evaluate other factors that simultaneously play a role in microbiome composition of all secretors and nonsecretors and how this influences host immunity. 15 This is especially important for the determination of the best strategies to protect those in low-income areas in which HuNoV is of greatest public health concern, and the microbiome is likely an effective target for future personalized therapies. 63 ",

            "text": "(Gn) pig model To study the role of microbiota in response to virus infection and vaccines, animal models that are without a preexisting microbiota and can be colonized with well-defined microbiota, (i.e., Gn animals) are an indispensable tool. Gn animals have played a critical role in the understanding of interactions among microbiota, viral pathogen or vaccine antigen, and the host. 71 The neonatal Gn pig model is well suited for the study of HuNoV and microbiome interaction because Gn pig model of HuNoV infection reflects HuNoV biology in terms of supporting the natural oral route of infection and results in diarrhea, transient viremia, and fecal virus shedding. 72, 73 Recently, we established a human gut microbiota (HGM) transplanted Gn pig model of HuNoV infection and disease, using a well-characterized stool sample from a healthy infant as HGM transplant and a HuNoV GII.4/2006b strain for virus inoculation. 16 Compared to germ-free Gn pigs, HuNoV inoculation in HGM transplanted Gn pigs resulted in increased HuNoV infection, characterized by significantly higher shedding titers and significantly longer mean duration of virus shedding. HuNoV infection also dramatically altered intestinal microbiota at the phylum and genus levels in HGM transplanted Gn pigs. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria (95.6% versus 56.5%) and Firmicutes (3.6% versus 0.5%) significantly decreased, while Bacteroidetes (0.1% versus 42.9%) significantly increased; at the genus level, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, and Anaerococcus significantly decreased, while Bacteroides and Lactobacillus significantly increased in HGM transplanted pigs infected with HuNoV compared to HGM transplanted pigs without HuNoV infection. In summary, enhanced GII.4 HuNoV infection was observed in the presence of HGM, and significant intestinal microbiota alterations were observed under HuNoV infection in HGM transplanted Gn pigs. 16 The mechanisms underlying the enhancing effect of HGM on HuNoV infection are probed using transcriptome analysis of the ileum tissues of the Gn pigs. One of the most important impact of HGM is the down regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03bb gene IFN-1L expression. IFN-\u03bb is known to play a critical role in the host defense against enteric viruses, including rotavirus, reovirus 74 and norovirus. 75 ",

            "text": "Rotaviruses belong to the genus Rotavirus within the family Reoviridae, which are characterized by a segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. HRV is the leading cause of severe, dehydrating diarrhea among children under 5 years of age worldwide. 76 Annual mortality rates due to RV infections have declined from 528,000 in 2000 to 215,000 in 2013 76 owing to the implementation of HRV vaccines RotaTeq \u00ae and Rotarix \u00ae in the national immunization program in many countries. These two vaccine vaccines are highly efficacious (80-90%) in high income countries, but the efficacies are significantly reduced (40-60%) in low-income countries. Studies indicated that several factors, including microbiota dysbiosis, 77 concurrent uses of poliovirus oral vaccines, 78,79 enterovirus infections, 80 and malnutrition 81 contributed to the observed impaired efficacy of the oral RV vaccines, 79 likely by changing intestinal environments and homeostasis. 82, 83 Harris et al. 17 analyzed the serum IgA antibody responses to Rotarix \u00ae in 78 Ghanaian infants and their fecal microbiome. Comparing between the 39 responder and non-responder pairs and to the Dutch infants, the overall microbiome composition was significantly different, with the responders more similar to healthy Dutch infants than nonresponders. Responses to Rotarix \u00ae correlated with an increased abundance of Streptococcus bovis and the lack of response is correlated with the high abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum, especially several bacteria related to species from the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera. 17 Another study was reported for Pakistani infants. 18 IgA antibody responses to Rotarix \u00ae correlated with higher abundance of bacteria belonging to Clostridium cluster XI and Proteobacteria, including bacteria related to Serratia and Escherichia coli. Abundance of these Proteobacteria was also significantly higher in Dutch infants when compared to non-responders in Pakistan. These clinical studies showed that the intestinal microbiota composition correlated with seroconversion rate in infants after vaccination and identified microbiome signatures of vaccine responder versus non-responder infants. Identification of key bacterial phylotypes that correlate with vaccine-induced responses could be used as indicator to predict which infants are at risk for vaccine failure and to design an intervention through modulating gut microbiota to improve rotavirus vaccine efficacy. 18, 77 A study of microbiome diversity in RataTeq vaccinated versus unvaccinated children in Spain did not find any differences. 84 2.4.2 Study of microbiota and immunogenicity of HRV vaccine in Gn pig model To clearly identify the role of microbiota in the immunogenicity of HRV vaccine, a Gn pig model of enteric dysbiosis was developed to evaluate the effects of different HGM on immune responses to HRV vaccination and protective efficacy. 19 Fecal samples collected from infants from Nicaragua were analyzed and classified as healthy (HHGM) or unhealthy (UHGM) based on enteropathy score and seroconversion status after vaccination with RotaTeq \u00ae . Newborn Gn pigs were transplanted with the HHGM or UHGM, followed by oral vaccination with the live attenuated Wa HRV and challenged with virulent HRV. Prior to HRV challenge, HHGM in Gn pigs was predominantly composed of bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, whereas UHGM was composed of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. When challenged, the severity of illness among vaccinated HHGM pigs was much lower compared to vaccinated UHGM pigs. Analysis of fecal microbiome post-challenge showed a significant increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes in HHGM transplanted Gn pigs and a significant decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia abundance. Stronger vaccine-induced immune responses (HRV-specific IgG, IgA and VN antibodies; and CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + and CD8+ IFN-\u03b3 + T cells) were facilitated by HHGM, hence conferring a stronger protection against HRV disease among vaccinated HHGM pigs than UHGM pigs. 19 Similar results were also observed in Gn pigs colonized with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, commensal bacteria commonly found as part of the microbiota of breast-fed infants. 20 Findings in Gn pigs are highly translatable to humans and as suggested by Dr. Harris \"Correlate microbiome composition with vaccine effectiveness in appropriate experimental platforms will lead to the identification of safe, vaccine-supporting microbiota targets that are relevant to populations in need of improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.\" 18 ",

Due to the well-documented crosstalk between the gut and liver, the microbiota and its immunomodulatory effects on HBV and HCV infections have recently become a topic of interest in the research community. 85,85a As was demonstrated by the previously discussed studies, certain phyla and families of beneficial bacteria appear to be underrepresented in patients with certain viral diseases. In a study by Wei et al., it was shown that patients with chronic HBV infection that had progressed to cirrhosis were lacking in Bacteroidetes composition in the gut, as well as showing increased Proteobacteria concentration, a phylum known to contain several pathogenic bacteria. 21 There was also marked prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Streptococcaceae, which made up for less than 1% of the gut microbiota sampled from healthy patients. 21 In two HCV studies by Aly et al. 22 and Bajaj 23 et al., low diversity of gut microbiome composition was associated with inflammation and disease. Interestingly, Aly et al.'s data showed chronic HCV patients had a significant increase in Bacteroidetes, as opposed to the previously discussed HBV patients, who had a marked decrease of this phylum in their composition. 21, 22 In the HCV patients, Prevotella was significantly increased, perhaps explaining the increase in Bacteroidetes phylum composition in this group. 22 This study also demonstrated a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in the healthy control group, dissimilar to the HBV study, which showed a higher abundance in the HBV group. 21, 22 In the HCV study, ill patients also displayed significant prevalence of Acinetobacter, Veillonella, and Phascolarctobacterium, as well, with no detection of Bifidobacterium genus, which was of relatively increased richness in two healthy patients. 22 Ruminococcus was also significantly enriched in healthy patients versus those with HCV, and this genus is considered to be largely beneficial in the gut. 22, 23 Though more research is needed in regards to the gut-liver axis and its role in immunity against HBV and HCV infections, the current literature has demonstrated a strong link between the gut microbiota and how the immune system functions in acute and chronic viral diseases. The disadvantage that remains is the microbiota's complexity, as is shown by the differences in compositions between patients with two different strains of the same virus. Fortunately, due to the development of vaccines, new hepatitis cases have dramatically decreased across the world, though chronic infections continue to pose a threat to those who do contract the virus. The gut microbiota may be a means to harness new therapies to relieve the increased mortality that comes with progression of chronic hepatitis infection.",

Poultry eggs and meat are crucial components to maintaining food security all over the globe. Fast-growing domestic poultry species are exposed to many environmental factors that can affect their health, performance, and productivity. To protect poultry from factors that may render them vulnerable to disease, scientists continuously investigate internal and external factors that may affect their health and productivity. The gastrointestinal tract has been a central part of these investigations as the gut health, function, and integrity are essential for overall wellbeing of birds. The gut microbiota, which contains tremendous numbers of bacterial species, has recently been extensively characterized in some avian species including chickens, turkeys, and ducks. [95] [96] [97] The influence of viral infections on the gut health and the homeostasis of commensal microbial populations of affected birds have been also investigated. Viral infections are also known risk factors for coinfection by other secondary, opportunistic pathogens as they cause damage to local and systemic immune defenses. 98 Here, we review the interplay between a number of viral pathogens and the gut microbiota of their respective natural avian hosts.

            "text": "The effect of LPAI infection on the homeostasis of the gut microbiota of poultry has been investigated very recently. Experimental infection of young chickens with H9N2 virus caused alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition. In infected chickens, the bacterial numbers of the phylum Proteobacteria were increased and the bacteria belonging to the genera Vampirovibrio, Pseudoflavonifractor, Ruminococcus, Clostridium cluster XIVb, and Isobaculum were enriched differentially. 24 Proteobacteria contains important gram-negative pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genera Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella, and Helicobacter. 100 In uninfectedapparently healthy-chickens, differential enrichment of the genera Novosphingobium, Sphingomonas, Bradyrhizobium, and Bifidobacterium was observed. 24 Comparing the same chicken group before and after infection, Yitbarek et al. observed notable changes in the relative abundance of bacteria at various taxonomic levels. 24 Pre-infection, chickens were characterized by the increased abundance of two families and three genera of bacteria, while postinfection differential enrichment of members from one class, two orders, and one genus of bacteria were recorded. In a study by Li et al. 25 at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was increased-as observed in the study above-while that of Firmicutes was decreased in H9N2 virus-infected young chickens. The relative abundance of endogenous bacterial genera within the family Enterobacteriaceae was increased; these genera included Escherichia-especially E. coli which colonized the ileum-, Clostridium, and Veillonella. On the other hand, a severe reduction in the probiotic organisms including the lactic acid-producing bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus), Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and SMB53 was observed. 25 These findings clearly indicate that an influenza virus infection can disrupt the commensal microbial population in affected chickens. Waterfowl species are natural reservoir of IAV and infections in these birds, unlike chickens, are asymptomatic. The composition and diversity of cloacal microbiome and their relationship with the active status of IAV infection and affected host have been studied in five waterfowl species: A. acuta (northern pintail), A. americana (American wigeon), A. carolinensis (green-winged teal), A. clypeata (northern shoveler), and A. platyrhynchos (mallard). 101 Six bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes (ordered based on proportions of abundance) were consistently represented in IAVnegative, i.e., healthy, ducks of the above-mentioned five species. These phyla composed an average of 97.1% of the ducks' microbiota and thus were further investigated in the study. The relative abundance of bacterial phyla was drastically different within the various host species, with no unique patterns across species. However, green-winged teals and mallards showed the same pattern of abundance for all phyla, while northern shovelers showed the opposite pattern. The relationship among the various groups of bacterial taxa was evaluated using a microbiome diversity measurement, bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) co-occurrence patterns. The observed OTUs in IAV-positive and -negative birds showed no consistent patterns among host species. Moreover, the number of observed OTUs by IAV infection status was only significant in two out of five duck species. 101 Findings from this study indicates that host genetics (and possibly other environmental factors, e.g., feed and habitat) may play a crucial role in the response of waterfowl to influenza virus infections. Another study on juvenile wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) only analyzed the differences in the cloacal microbiome of IAV-infected birds as compared to healthy ones. 26 Overall, the cloacal microbiome in healthy mallards was more rich, diverse, robust, and uniform than that in IAV-infected birds. Among 41 identified OTUs, IAV-infected mallards were found to have 12 versus 24 in healthy birds. Thus, IAV-negative mallards were richer in OTUs and had greater OTU diversity and evenness than those of IAVpositive group. The same six bacterial phyla listed above were also represented in both IAV-positive and -negative birds at similar levels of relative abundance. The higher differences were observed within the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Members of the genus Streptococcus and species Veillonella dispar and Rothia mucilaginosa were major contributors to these differences. 26 ",

In intestinal microbiota-depleted chickens, H9N2 virus infection caused significant increase in oropharyngeal and cloacal virus shedding. Also, the mRNA expression of type I IFNs (i.e., INF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and IL-22 was suppressed in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. 102 ",

            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV, aka avian paramyxovirus 1) belongs to species Avian orthoavulavirus 1, genus Orthoavulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae, with a negative sense, single-stranded, monopartite RNA genome. 105 NDV affects a wide variety of avian species, among them the most susceptible and economically important are chickens and turkeys, 106 which can virtually be infected at all ages. Depending on the strain and tropism of the virus, NDV can cause a variety of symptoms involving the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, the respiratory system, and the reproductive system of affected birds, leading to up to 100% morbidity and mortality. 107 The adverse effect of NDV infection on the development of intestinal microbiota in chickens has been recently reported by Cui et al. 27 Although the study was performed in newly hatched chicks which were infected in ovo with NDV, it presented significant insight into the impact of such an infection on the intestinal microbial communities in chickens. In uninfected chicks, the duodenum had a richer (indicated by higher OTU counts and abundance indices) and more diverse microbiota than the cecum. In normal duodenum, the predominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, with six more less-dominant phyla. At the genus level, bacteria from Serratia, Escherichia, Chitinophagaceae unclassified, Saprospiraceae unclassified, and Lactobacillus were represented the most in the normal duodenum among other genera. In the cecum of uninfected chicks, the prevailing bacterial phyla were only Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with five more marginally-represented phyla detected. At the genus level, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Erwinia, Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Serratia constituted the great majority of the normal cecal microbiota. 27 Comparing NDV-infected with uninfected chicks, the richness and diversity of duodenal microbiota were lower in the former. The cecal microbiota was almost unaffected by the NDV infection. As for the microbial composition, both duodenal and cecal bacterial communities were adversely affected in a similar manner. An increase in Sinobacteraceae and Rhodoplanes family members was observed. Also, at the genus level, a massive loss was observed in members of the following families in both duodenum and cecum of NDVinfected chicks: Xanthomonadaceae, SC-I-84, Cytophagaceae, Bacteroidales, Chitinophagaceae, Gemm-1, Saprospiraceae, Ignavibacteriaceae, Rhizobiales, Sphingobacteriales, Ellin6067, Acidimicrobiales, and Pseudomonas. Moreover, a dramatic reduction was found in the abundance of Xanthomonadaceae and Cytophagaceae family members. 27 A significant reduction in the relative abundance of Serratia and Clostridium genera residing in the duodenum was recorded as opposed to greatly increased numbers in the ceca. This implied a possible translocation of these genera from duodenum to cecum of NDV-infected chicks. Moreover, authors proposed a translocation of several bacterial genera from the cecum to the duodenum of infected birds according to changes in their relative abundance. 27 Talebi et al. studied the effect of a mixture of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, and Bifidobacterium bifidium), administered in water, on the antibody response and production performance in NDV-vaccinated broiler chickens. 108 The study showed enhancement in birds' body weight and feed conversion rate; however, the humeral immune response to NDV vaccination was similar to that of untreated, vaccinated groups. Similar results were later revealed by Bautista-Garfias et al., 109 who studied the effect of oral administration of L. casei (ATCC7469 strain) on the humeral immune response to NDV vaccination and production performance in fighting roosters. Blood anti-NDV antibody levels in L. casei-treated group were comparable to those of the vaccine control birds. On the other hand, the natural mortality rate and body weight gain were significantly improved in the probiotic-treated group, compared with the untreated one. 109 The use of two (cecal and jejunal) bacterial isolates of L. reuteri PIA16 strain in feed, either alone or with a prebiotic (mannan oligosaccharide), demonstrated substantially enhanced humoral immune response to NDV vaccine in broiler chickens. The cell-mediated immune response; however, remained largely unaffected throughout the course of the experimental period. 28 Results from the probiotics studies indicate that these beneficial bacteria can boost the performance and overall health status in poultry. Although these studies showed generic positive impact on NDV-vaccinated chickens, the associated changes in the intestinal microbiota have not been examined. Moreover, whether the supplementation of these probiotics/prebiotics has an enhanced protective effect for NDV vaccines against the consequences of an NDV challenge is yet to be investigated.",

            "text": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus, family Birnaviridae, with a double-stranded, segmented RNA genome. 110 IBDV affects chickens at young ages and causes an acute, immunosuppressive disease, infectious bursal disease. IBDV infection causes depression of the local and humoral immune responses (due to a direct effect on B lymphocytes); and induces damages in the primary lymphoid organs, mainly the bursa of Fabricius, in addition to the spleen, thymus, and cecal tonsils. 111, 112 The role of IBDV in modulating the commensal microbiota in chickens has recently been studied. 29 Young chickens were infected with IBDV and the changes in the cecal bacterial communities were analyzed in comparison with uninfected, healthy birds. Regardless of the infection status, nine bacterial phyla were represented in the chicken cecal microbiota, with Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes members forming more than 95% of total bacterial population in the cecum. At the family level, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae composed the majority of cecal microbiota, with the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae decreasing over time and that of Ruminococcaceae increasing over time for up to 7 weeks of age. At the genus level, an increase in the abundance of Faecalibacterium was observed till 4 weeks of age, and decreased thereafter. IBDV infection of young chickens caused immediate and obvious alteration in the composition of cecal microbiota. Changes were continuously seen over a three-week observation period postinfection, 29 though no certain pattern was observed. At the genus level, in comparison to uninfected group, IBDV-infected chickens had a lower abundance in the commensal Clostridium XlVa at day 3 postinfection, which became higher thereafter. On the other hand, after 7 days of IBDV infection chickens had a higher abundance of Faecalibacterium (Gram-positive bacteria) than uninfected ones, which became lower thereafter. A reduction in the abundance of Escherichia/Shigella (Proteobacteria) was observed in chickens until 3 weeks postinfection, which contributed to the overall decrease recorded for family Enterobacteriaceae. 29 These changes in the cecal microbiota were associated with IBDV-induced immunosuppression, the manifestations of which is described below. Another study showed that the infection of young chickens with IBDV or Campylobacter jejuni, either alone or combined, provoked significant modifications in the composition of gut microbiota, as compared with uninfected chickens. 30 Changes in the abundance of OTUs from the following bacterial genera were observed in the cecal contents of infected chickens: Campylobacter, Clostridium XIVa, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia. The abundance of Campylobacter was increased in IBDV/C. jejuni-infected chickens and it was higher in birds inoculated with bacteria at 7 days versus 9 days postinfection. Obviously, the exposure time to a secondary pathogen following an immunosuppressive viral infection has a significant impact on its pathogenicity, colonization, and persistence, as is the case here with IBDV and C. jejuni. Similar observations have been reported for hemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys-a siadenovirus-based immunosuppressive disease-and secondary E. coli infections. 113 The particular effect of immunosuppression-inducing IBDV infection on the colonization and shedding of C. jejuni and Salmonella in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens has been investigated. Unlike C. jejuni, Salmonella is pathogenic in poultry; however, both are important pathogens in human and can cause severe food-borne gastroenteritis. 114, 115 Apart from C. jejuni and Salmonella infections, inoculation of young chickens with various strains of IBDV resulted in atrophy and pronounced lesions in the bursa of Fabricius, bursal B cell depletion, reduction or depletion in circulating B lymphocytes as well as those localized in the cecal lamina propria and cecal tonsils, and a reduced thickness of cecal mucosa. 27, 29, 32, 116, 117 Virus replication in the bursa, cecal tonsils, and cecum was detected for up to several weeks postinfection. 27, 29, 116 In IBDV-infected chickens with immunosuppression, unlike C. jejuni only-infected birds, the bacteria colonized the small intestines, and was detected at an earlier time point and at much higher titers in the cecum and cloaca (i.e., virus shedding). 27, 116 These results were consistent with the reduced B lymphocytes and the lack of C. jejunispecific IgG antibodies in the cecal lamina propria. 27 Likewise, IBDV infection of chickens exacerbated Salmonella multi-organ colonization, pathogenicity, fecal shedding, and persistence in chickens exposed to infections at early ages. 31, 32, 117 The highest Salmonella-mediated pathogenicity and mortality rates were recorded in chickens coinfected with IBDV and S. enteritidis, 31,32 but not S. typhimurium. 117 Both intestinal mucosal 41 and systemic (Salmonella-specific IgG) antibody responses were lower in chickens coinfected with IBDV and Salmonella, which coincided with the immunosuppressive effects described above. However, unlike C. jejuni, Salmonella clearance appeared not to be related to the antibody response. Numbers of localized T lymphocytes and cell-mediated immune responses did not seem to be affected by IBDV infections. 27,32",

            "text": "Turkey adenovirus 3, commonly known as hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), belongs to genus Siadenovirus, family Adenoviridae, with a doublestranded, linear DNA genome. 118 HEV is present naturally in two strains; virulent, which causes an immune-mediated, acute disease characterized by bloody diarrhea, enteric hemorrhage, and death; and avirulent, which is widely used as a vaccine strain. Both strains cause transient period of immunosuppression and splenomegaly and target the IgM + B cells in the spleen and peripheral blood. In addition to turkeys, HEV causes immune-mediated diseases in pheasants and chickens characterized by pulmonary edema and splenomegaly. Lesions in several organs have been also reported in affected birds. 113 Changes in the abundance of microbial populations between HEVinfected and uninfected turkeys have recently been investigated. Analysis of OTUs detected in the gut of healthy turkeys revealed the presence of four abundant phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In healthy turkeys, Firmicutes was the predominant phylum (80-100%) in the three small intestinal sections, while in the cecum a more heterogeneous population containing representatives from Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria was observed. 33 The diversity of cecal microbial population was also observed throughout the developmental stages of turkeys up to 16 weeks of age. The bacterial populations were also dissected at the genus level in the different gastrointestinal tract sections and Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium XI were the prevailing genera forming nearly 80% of the total microbiota. An interesting finding was that Campylobacter spp. was most abundant in the cecum of turkey poults at 10 weeks of age. 96 Interestingly, similar to turkeys, both chickens and ducks have a greater microbial diversity in the cecum as compared to the rest of the small intestine. 96, 119, 120 The abundance of jejunal bacterial populations at the family level was altered by natural infections of HEV in turkeys. Compared to uninfected turkeys, infected birds with clinical signs and HEV detected in the intestines-indicating an early-phase infection-had a lower abundance in Micrococcaceae and a higher abundance of Propionibacteriaceae, while those turkeys with no clinical signs and virus detected in the spleen-indicating a late-phase infection-had a much lower abundance in both families. The abundance of family Bacteroidaceae was extremely increased in HEV-infected turkeys as compared to uninfected controls. For the phyla Firmicutes, a substantial reduction in Lactobacillaceae and an increase in Clostridiaceae was observed in intestinally-positive turkeys with clinical signs. An opposite trend was recorded for turkeys with positive spleens and no clinical signs. However, both groups of infected turkeys showed an increased abundance of three other families belonging to Firmicutes. Family Campylobacteriaceae increased in abundance by 18-to 26-folds in HEV-infected turkeys. 33 HEV infection of turkeys has been associated with secondary E. coli infections during the transient immunosuppression period. 34 HEV is transmitted through fecal-oral route and eventually reaches the blood stream. In the spleen, the virus replicates rapidly in B lymphocytes and to a much lower extent in macrophages. Hyperplasia of the splenic white pulp occurs as a result of infiltration with high numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells. The interplay among these various types of immune cells within the site of viral replication leads to the production of very high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines of type I and II IFNs. The latter activates macrophages, inducing the production of the antiviral and immunosuppressive nitric oxide (NO). Most likely, IFN-I and NO play a role in clearing the virus later from the spleen. [121] [122] [123] Moreover, it was suggested that the intestinal hemorrhage in the jejunum area occurs through inflammation-induced \"diapedesis.\" 124 This might be associated with a compromised intestinal epithelial cell barrier of the gut as noticed with other enteric viral infections.",

Specific pathogen-free chickens were placed for a few days with age-matched peers in commercial and back yard farms with previous history of enteric and respiratory problems. Intestinal samples were then collected and the enteric virome and microbiome were analyzed. 125 The analysis revealed that the new viruses which colonized the gut of SPF birds belong to the families Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae. This implies that members of these families are associated with enteric diseases in chickens. In these birds, alterations of the gut microbiome were also observed, specifically in the Lachnospiracea family and the Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera. Other virus families that were represented in the enteric virome of chickens included Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Leviviridae, Siphoviridae, and Retroviridae. 125 In another study, the fecal virome in healthy commercial chickens was analyzed by viral nucleic acid purification, illumina sequencing, and de novo assembly. 126 Analysis of the assembled viral genome sequences indicated the presence of viruses belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae. 126 Additionally, novel, unclassified, viruses with circular single-stranded DNA genomes were identified. The fecal virome of wild waterfowls has been also recently analyzed in various species of migratory wild ducks. 127 The DNA and RNA viral genomes were isolated from purified viral particles, their nucleotide sequences obtained, and analyzed. The most abundant viral familied recognized in the duck's virome were Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae, and Myoviridae. 127 In a more recent study on healthy waterfowl and shorebirds, the presence of 27 viral species was reported. These species represent the families Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, and Parvoviridae. Variations in virus abundance and diversity were detected among the various species studied. 128 The results signify the potential of wild birds as reservoir of disease-causing poultry pathogens.",

Antibodies generated by the sow during and after gestation have been successful to an extent but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from PEDV na\u00efve sows. 149 Bacterial composition of the neonatal gastrointestinal tracts 35 often begins with the colonization of aerobic or facultatively aerobic bacteria belonging to Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Streptococcus spp. The consumption of oxygen within the GIT of the newborn piglets allows for the subsequent colonization of anaerobes such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, Oscillibacter, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Ruminococcaceae spp. 150, 151 Analysis of the microbiota composition in the small and large intestines of PEDV infected piglets showed an increase in abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium, and Veillonella. 39 In parallel to this, a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria such as Rikenellaceae (RC9 gut group), Butyricimonas, and Alistipes were also observed among infected piglets. 40 A reduction in SCFA production within the GIT has been linked with an increased state of dysbiosis in piglets implicating reasons for severity of PEDV infection. 152, 153 Huang et al. showed that bacteria belonging to Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Porphyromonadaceae, were associated with healthy piglets as compared to PEDV infected piglets. 39 ",

Along with the large-scale application of high throughout sequences and metagenome techniques, literatures in characterization and variation of microbiota in ruminant animals increased explosively.

The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased in healthy calves, while Proteobacteria was abundant in rotavirus diarrhea samples. 43 This was consistent with human rotavirus diarrhea cases that the phylum Proteobacteria is associated with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. 41 At the genus level, in rotavirus-infected calves, there was significant increase of the genera Escherichia, Clostridium, and Streptococcus. However, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Coprococcus were decreased. Notably, Lactobacillus was significantly decreased in the rotavirus diarrhea calves. At the species level, Lactobacillus species such as L. gasseri and L. amylovorus were found to be relatively abundant in healthy calves. L. gasseri is known to prevent the severity of acute self-limiting diarrhea in adults. 42 In rotavirus-infected calves, the relative abundance of G. formicillis, B. glucerasea, B. coccoides, and B. obeum were significantly higher in the healthy group. Two species of C. perfringens and E. coli associated with the diarrheic calves were identified. 43 This study demonstrated that rotavirus infection changed the structure of the gut microbiota, which would affect the follow up diagnosis and administration.",

Meanwhile, the virus propagation ability of BLV strains was negatively correlated with one taxon of Sanguibacteroides. Besides causing lymphoproliferation and leukemia, BLV infection may decrease energy production efficiency in the infected cows through modification of rumen and hindgut microbiota. 44 According to function speculation of the bacteria detected in the differential abundance analysis, energy production loss in the rumen and hindgut was assumed, which may explain the secondary negative effects such as increased susceptibility to other infections and decreased lifetime milk production and reproductive efficiency.

These data are very important in terms of viral infection, as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available. Further understanding of the interactions between viral pathogens, host species and their microbiota will eventually allow us to tailor the contents of the microorganisms to the extent that it is able to protect the host from certain life-threatening viral infections. More research is needed to establish concrete cause and effect relationships between the microbiota composition and viral infection, as many of these studies did not address other factors that also are known to influence microbiota composition, such as genetics, diet, and environment. It should also be noted that some of these studies focused on small cohorts of participants, and more work is needed to establish trends among larger populations.
