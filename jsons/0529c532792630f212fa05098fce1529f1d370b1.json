The roots of this failure lie in the problem of defining asthma, and the consequent difficulty of reproducible and conclusive case ascertainment; in the transient nature of the principal symptoms, the fact that asthma is heterogeneous in its underlying pathophysiology; and in the absence of simple sensitive and specific markers for the condition. However, the epidemiology of asthma and allergy is currently undergoing a rapid expansion and has shifted attention from traditional risk factors which may exacerbate asthma, to protective factors that may prevent respiratory allergies and asthma. This growth of interest is occurring in the context of major concerns about the increasing burden of respiratory allergy and asthma morbidity, and the realization that previous etiological theories based on animal models of asthma and clinical observations do not appear to explain the large global increases in asthma prevalence.",

Symptoms can be induced by inhalation of allergens, even at very low concentrations. Individuals that are not sensitized to these allergens will usually not show symptoms even with very high exposure. Symptoms in sensitized subjects are caused by inflammatory reactions initiated by allergen-specific IgE antibodies present in the airways.

Several studies have found the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma to be substantially lower than the prevalence of asthma symptoms in the community (e.g., Asher et al. 1998 ). This is not surprising since a clinical diagnosis of asthma can only be made if a person presents him or herself to a doctor.

Measurements of lung function are the most frequently used and provide important information on airflow limitation including variability, reversibility, and severity.

Spirometry is the preferred method and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 /, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) can be derived from this method as indicators for airway obstruction. Pre-and postbronchodilator treatment is important since it will establish whether obstruction is reversible and will distinguish it from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which obstruction is mostly irreversible. Reversibility of airway obstruction defined as FEV 1 of 12% and 200mL from the prebronchodilator value is generally accepted as a valid indication of asthma (GINA 2006) . However, due to the highly variable nature of the condition, repeated lung function tests are required. PEF meters are inexpensive and easy to use, but they are less precise than spirometry and may underestimate the degree of airflow limitation (Aggarwal et al. 2006) .",

Standardized questionnaires on asthma symptoms have therefore become the cornerstone of large studies of the incidence or prevalence of asthma (Burney et al. 1994; Asher et al. 1995) . This approach allows a large number of participants to be surveyed without great cost, in a short time period. Wheezing, chest tightness, breathlessness, and coughing are all symptoms clinically associated with asthma, but epidemiological studies have shown that wheezing is the most important symptom for the identification of asthma, and the majority of questionnaires used to assess asthma prevalence are based on this symptom (Pearce et al. 1998a ) (see Sect. 56.4.1 for more detail).",

            "text": "Ten years ago it was widely believed that asthma was an atopic disease caused by allergen exposure. The fundamental etiological mechanism was that allergen exposure, particularly in infancy, produced atopic sensitization, and continued exposure resulted in asthma through the development of eosinophilic airways inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that this picture is, at best, too simplistic (Ronchetti et al. 2007; Weinmayr et al. 2007) . A systematic review of population-based studies ) has shown that the proportion of asthma cases that are attributable to atopy (defined as skin prick test positivity) is usually less than one-half. Standardized comparisons across populations or time periods also show only weak and inconsistent associations between the prevalence of asthma and the prevalence of atopy. For instance, a comparison of asthma and atopy in 9-to 11-year-olds in Albania and the United Kingdom (Priftanji et al. 2001) showed large differences in the prevalence of current wheeze (4.4% and 9.7%, respectively) and exercise-induced bronchial reactivity (0.8% and 5.4%), but not in skin prick test positivity (15.0% and 17.8%), suggesting that large variations in asthma prevalence can occur without differences in frequency of atopy. This was confirmed by the International Study of Allergies and Asthma in Children (ISAAC; see Sects. 56.5.3 and 56.5.4 ) which showed that the association between atopy and asthma symptoms differed strongly among populations but increased with the level of economic development (Weinmayr et al. 2007) . In this study, the proportion of current wheeze attributable to atopy ranged from 0% in Ankara (Turkey) to 93.8% in Guangzhou (China); the overall proportion of asthma cases that were attributable to atopy was only 41% in affluent countries and 20% in non-affluent countries. This is consistent with a recent study among 3,960 children in Ecuador which found a population attributable fraction of only 2.4% for recent wheeze and atopy (Moncayo et al. 2010) . A similar study in Salvador, Brazil suggested the proportion of asthma attributable to atopy to be 24.5% (Souza da Cunha et al. 2010), which, although higher than in Ecuador, is substantially lower than the 50% in most Western countries. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (see Sects. 56.5.2 and 56.5.4) found that the proportion of asthma attributable to atopy in adults ranged from 4% to 61% between individual study centers with an overall estimate of only 30% for all centers combined ). Finally, time trend studies have shown different patterns for atopy and astma in the same geographical areas. For example, a recent study in Sweden in 7-to 8-year-olds showed a significant increase in allergic sensitization over a 10-year period (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) despite asthma symptoms remaining stable over the same period (Bjerg et al. 2010) .",

This results (through T-helper-2 (Th 2 / responses) in the production of allergen-specific IgE. Once allergic, a subject can develop symptoms minutes after being exposed. This is known as the early phase allergic reaction, and symptoms develop as a result of mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators through allergen IgE antibody complexes at the surface of the mast cells, causing contraction of bronchial smooth muscle and edema in the airways. Clinically, this results in a decreased lung function and symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.",

Patients may have severe and persistent asthma in the absence of eosinophilic inflammation and may experience an exacerbation of asthma without an increase in eosinophilic inflammation (Turner et al. 1995) . Repeated assessments of airway inflammation over time have shown that the non-eosinophilic asthma phenotype is reproducible both in the short (4 weeks) and long term (1 to 5 years) (Simpson et al. 2006) . However, the underlying mechanisms of non-eosinophilic/non-allergic asthma are not fully understood. One study in 93 non-smoking adult asthmatics found elevated sputum airway eosinophilia in 41% of all asthma cases, 20% had elevated levels of neutrophils, 8% had a mixed inflammatory profile with both cell types being elevated, and the remainder (31%) had no signs of airway inflammation with eosinophil and neutrophil levels both being within the normal range (Simpson et al. 2006 ). This suggests that asthma can be categorized into four inflammatory subtypes based on the sputum eosinophil and neutrophil proportions: eosinophilic asthma, neutrophilic asthma, mixed granulocytic asthma, and paucigranulocytic asthma (Simpson et al. 2006) .",

However, in practice, asthma incidence is very difficult to measure, both because of the intensive long-term monitoring required and because of the difficulty of establishing the date of onset of the condition. Therefore, most studies involve prevalence rather than incidence. Similar techniques to those described in this section can be used in incidence studies, although incidence studies may involve more intensive monitoring to enable a diagnosis of asthma to be more firmly established. Asthma prevalence reflects both the incidence of asthma and the average duration of the condition. Thus, a population may have a high prevalence of asthma either due to a high exposure to factors (genetic or environmental) which induce asthma or because of high exposure to factors which incite, exacerbate, or prolong asthma symptoms in those who have previously developed the disease (Dolovich and Hargreave 1981).",

            "text": "Although asthma can be conceptualized either in terms of symptoms such as wheezing or in terms of the underlying bronchial inflammation, the essential feature of asthma (at least in clinical and epidemiological terms) is variable airflow obstruction which can be reversed by treatment or is self-limiting (see Sect. 56.2.4 ). This poses several problems with the use of \"diagnosed asthma\" in asthma prevalence studies, since the diagnosis of \"variable airflow obstruction\" usually requires several medical consultations over an extended period. It is therefore not surprising that several studies have found the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma to be substantially lower than the prevalence of asthma symptoms. For example, Ehrlich et al. (1995) , in a survey in school children in Cape Town, found that among children with more than 12 attacks of wheezing in the previous 12 months, only 60% were reported as asthmatic and only 55% as receiving regular treatment. These problems with using \"diagnosed asthma\" as an outcome measure in epidemiological studies not only affect prevalence estimates but also affect time trends (Hill et al. 1989 ) and geographical and social patterns of asthma prevalence. For example, some studies (e.g., Peckham and Butler 1978) have found diagnosed asthma to be more common in upper social class children, possibly because of greater access to health care and therefore greater likelihood of being labeled as asthmatic. The same concerns apply, perhaps to a greater extent, in surveys of use of asthma medication or health services. Although such information may be of value in asthma morbidity studies, it is of very limited use in prevalence studies .",

Thus, operational definitions of asthma involve specification of the time period during which symptoms may have occurred. In particular, \"current symptoms\" are usually defined as symptoms at any time in the previous 12 months. Although there has been concern that repeated questioning of subjects could increase awareness of respiratory symptoms, a comparison of findings from an intensive longitudinal study and a prevalence study within similar populations found very similar symptom prevalence suggesting that repeated questioning of the longitudinal study population had not biased the prevalence estimates (Sears et al. 1997) .",

Strictly speaking, the term exposure refers to the presence of a substance (e.g., house dust mite allergen) in the external environment, whereas the term dose refers to the amount of substance that reaches susceptible targets within the body, such as the airways. In some situations (e.g., in a coal mine), measurements of external exposures may be strongly correlated with internal dose, whereas in other situations (e.g., indoor exposure to house dust mite allergen), the dose may depend on individual lifestyle and activities and may therefore be only weakly correlated with the environmental exposure levels. However, in this chapter we use the term \"exposure\" in the very general sense to denote any attribute or agent which may increase the risk of experiencing the outcome under study. It includes demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, social class) and genetic factors as well as environmental risk factors (measured externally and/or internally).",

The risk of developing sensitization to an allergen may be much greater if the duration of exposure is long and/or the exposure is high, and the total cumulative exposure may therefore be important. However, once a person has become sensitized, then the concentration may be crucial in provoking an acute attack, and such attacks may occur after exposure of a relatively short duration. For protracted etiological processes, the time pattern of exposure may be important, and it is possible to assess this by examining the separate effects of exposures in various time windows prior to the occurrence and recognition of clinical disease (Pearce 1992) . For example, several studies have found that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the first years of life may be as relevant as current exposures with regard to current asthma symptoms (e.g., Shaw et al. 1994) . Similarly, it has been suggested that occupational asthma is most likely to occur after about 1 to 3 years of exposure to a sensitizing agent .",

Thus, if positive findings do occur, one can be confident that these are not due to inaccuracies in the exposure data; however, if no association (or only a weak association) is found between exposure and disease, then the possibility of non-differential information bias should be considered. In general, the aim of exposure assessment (see also chapter Exposure Assessment of this handbook) is to (1) ensure that the exposure data is of equal quality in the groups being compared and (2) ensure that the data is of the best possible quality given the former restriction.",

Thus, if the aim is to measure historical exposures, then historical information on exposure surrogates may be more valid than direct measurements of current exposure or dose levels. This situation has long been recognized in occupational epidemiology, where the use of work history records in combination with a job-exposure matrix (based on historical exposure measurements of work areas rather than individuals) is usually considered to be more valid than current exposure measurements (whether based on environmental measurements or biomarkers) if the aim is to estimate historical exposure levels (Checkoway et al. 2004 ).

However, atopy may also modify the effect of dust mite allergen exposure, that is, non-asthmatic atopic persons may be more likely to develop asthma symptoms than non-atopic persons at the same level of dust mite exposure.

Although measuring FE NO shows promise in the diagnosis and management of asthma, other factors not directly related to asthma such as smoking, atopy, height, and sex affect FE NO levels (Kharitonov et al. 1995; Olin et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2007; Dressel et al. 2008) . Furthermore, increased FE NO levels may only be associated with atopic or eosinophilic asthma, as patients with non-atopic or non-eosinophilic asthma appear to have normal FE NO levels, regardless of disease severity (Porsbjerg et al. 2009 ). Thus, despite FE NO being used in large population studies, it is a poor single diagnostic marker of asthma as has been demonstrated in community-based population studies (Travers et al. 2007) .

Exhaled NO (see above) measures only one aspect of airway inflammation which therefore does not provide a complete picture of the inflammatory responses underlying respiratory allergies and asthma. Initial studies on airway inflammation in asthmatics have relied upon bronchoalveolar lavage taken during bronchoscopy, but this technique is invasive and unsuitable for large-scale epidemiological studies. Sputum induction testing and exhaled breath condensate testing are methods involving non-invasive procedures that have the potential to be used in population-based studies.",

Lung function is measured in between each inhalation period and subjects given inhaled \" 2 -beta agonist if their FEV 1 drops below 15 to 20% of baseline. The subjects are asked to cough up any sputum after each dose of hypertonic saline and samples will be used to analyze cell types and inflammatory markers and mediators (e.g., IL4, IL5, IL8, ECP). These tests can be done in children from age 8 to 10 years and adults but given the laborious procedures involved the population sample size will necessarily be limited. An increasing number of population-based studies are being conducted using sputum induction testing, and these and previous studies have clearly shown that asthma consists of at least two inflammatory phenotypes (see Sect. 56.3.1). Further studies are currently in progress to assess the clinical and epidemiological importance of these findings.",

In addition, non-volatile substances (i.e., proteins including a number of cytokines) in the lower respiratory tract can be transported in the form of aerosols in exhaled breath. Successful collection of EBC has been reported using a variety of devices including teflon-lined tubing in an ice bath and specially designed double-wall glass condenser systems (Hoffmeyer et al. 2009 ). EBC has been shown to contain a range of inflammatory markers and mediators, including nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitrites, eicosanoids, and various cytokines (Kharitonov and Barnes 2006; Hoffmeyer et al. 2009 ). The significance of breath condensate analyses is that this technique is straightforward, non-invasive, and completely safe and could be widely used in population-based surveys of asthma (including young children in whom more invasive procedures are not possible). However, EBC results have been highly variable between and within laboratories, and further validation work is therefore required before the technique can \"routinely\" be used in epidemiological studies of respiratory allergies and asthma (Czebe et al. 2008 ).",

Nevertheless, most studies, which have determined the prevalence of asthma symptoms using the same methodology in the same community at different times, have reported that asthma prevalence has increased in recent decades and that the magnitude of the increase has in some cases been substantial (Table 56 .2).

During 1926 -1961 , the prevalence of asthma recorded at call up examinations was in the range of 0.02-0.08%. However, asthma prevalence increased from 0.29% in 1966 to 1.79% in 1989. The authors concluded that the increase was unlikely to be due to improved diagnostic methods and that much of the increase was likely to be real. This conclusion was strengthened by a concomitant rise (from 0.12% in 1966 to 0.75% in 1989) in exemptions and discharges due to asthma. This study is consistent with other evidence that the increases in asthma prevalence in industrialized countries appear to have commenced after the Second World War, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.",

The key problem is to gain information on large numbers of people in random samples collected in a comparable manner across social groups, regions, and countries. Thus, comparisons of asthma prevalence are increasingly being based on a simple comparison of symptom prevalence in a questionnaire survey in a large number of people, followed by more intensive testing of factors related to asthma (e.g., BHR) and risk factors for asthma (skin prick test positivity, serum IgE, and environmental exposures) in a subsample, and a repeat of the prevalence survey over time.

Thus, it is not inherited in the simple Mendelian fashion that is characteristic of single-gene disorders. A particular genetic factor may affect one or more aspects of the complex etiological processes potentially involved in asthma including atopic sensitization, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), airway inflammation, innate immunity, etc. Whether this genetic potential is expressed will depend on various factors, including whether sufficient exposure to environmental factors occurs. Investigating possible genes for the individual etiological factors is also fraught with difficulties, since control of these factors (e.g., IgE production and BHR) are also multifactorial (Zamel et al. 1996) . Also, as noted earlier, asthma is an extremely heterogeneous disease including a variety of phenotypical and clinical manifestations which are likely to be associated with different (combinations of) genes. Another potential source of phenotypic variability is that asthma development, exacerbations, and progression may involve different environmental triggers and genetic factors. Nonetheless, it is well established that people with a family history of asthma are more likely to develop asthma themselves, and parental asthma is a stronger predictor of asthma in the offspring than parental atopy. However, this association is not necessarily due only to genetic factors but could also reflect similar lifestyles and exposures in family members (Sandford et al. 1996) .",

However, the concordance was still only 19%, and even this may in part be due to similar environmental exposures in monozygotic twins, including a common intrauterine environment (Godfrey et al. 1994) . Other large population studies have yielded similar findings, but this may be because these studies have determined asthma on the basis of questionnaires or hospital and pharmacy records, whereas smaller studies with more intensive diagnostic methods have generally yielded higher concordance (Sandford et al. 1996) .",

However, these associations were relatively weak and the genetic variants very common. As a result, despite these associations being highly statistically significant, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying asthmatics based on these genetic variants was poor (Ober and Yao 2011) . Also, many \"asthma genes\" previously indentified in candidate gene association studies (using a hypothesis-driven approach) were not replicated in these large GWAS meta-analyses. This may be because GWAS studies are not able to detect some of the rarer variants (Michel et al. 2010) , or, alternatively, the previously indentified candidates may be false-positive results. Whatever the reason, it is clear that our knowledge of the genetics of asthma is currently still very limited, but future GWAS for asthma on well-defined asthma phenotypes may shed some more light on the importance of genetics in the development of asthma.",

One possible explanation is that the average age of onset in childhood and adolescence may be later in females. Levels of cord blood IgE are lower at birth in girls than in boys (Weeke 1992) , indicating a lower risk of the subsequent development of asthma. Some authors have noted that boys have smaller airways than girls, relative to lung size, and that this may explain the greater frequency and severity of lower respiratory tract illness in boys, even though infection rates are similar for both sexes (Martinez et al. 1988 ). Alternatively, it is possible that boys have more exposure to factors that increase asthma incidence or duration. The relatively higher prevalence (or smaller reduction in prevalence) in females than in males after puberty could be due to hormonal influences on allergic predisposition, airway size, inflammation, and smooth muscle vascular functions (Redline and Gold 1994) . Premenstrual asthma may be especially relevant to the hormonal involvement of asthma since it may not only cause asthma exacerbations but may thereby affect the frequency and duration of asthma symptoms, resulting in an increase in the prevalence of \"current asthma.\"",

Studies have shown associations between body weight and asthma in both adults (Braback et al. 2005 ) and children . Prospective studies of children suggest that obesity precedes asthma signaling a causal link (Gilliland et al. 2003; Gold et al. 2003) , as do studies showing associations between asthma and both weight gain and weight loss in adults (Hakala et al. 2000) . Nonetheless, some studies have failed to show an association (Brenner et al. 2001) , while others showed an association only in one sex (Mannino et al. 2006) . Several reported an association only with respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheeze), but not BHR (Bustos et al. 2005) , although this may merely indicate that obesity increases asthma risk through mechanisms other than BHR. Obesity may also increase severity in subjects with preexisting asthma (Akerman et al. 2004 ).",

In particular, it has been speculated that the increase in asthma prevalence may be due to a change in dietary patterns in the past few decades, that is, as cultures have become more \"westernized,\" they have shifted from a tradition of growing and consuming locally grown foods to consuming more processed foods with an overall increase in the intake of refined sugars, fats, and additives, as well as a reduction in the intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, and fish. Several observational studies have shown protective effects of fruit and vegetables, whole grain products, and fish (Devereux 2007) , and these findings are consistent with an ecological analysis of the ISAAC Phase I survey (Ellwood et al. 2001) . Fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain products are rich in antioxidants and may reduce airway inflammation by protecting the airways against both endogenous and exogenous oxidants (Devereux 2007) . Fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which may also protect against airway inflammation and subsequent symptoms of asthma (Devereux 2007 ). However, dietary supplement studies focusing on antioxidants and n-3 fatty acids have not shown convincing evidence of a protective effect on allergies and asthma (Reisman et al. 2006; Almqvist et al. 2007 ).",

Also, a large number of studies have reported associations between direct measurements of air pollution levels and exacerbation of preexisting asthma, both in children and adults (Boezen et al. 1999; WHO 2005) . Some studies, including a recent birth cohort study (Brauer et al. 2007) , have also suggested that air pollution may cause new onset of asthma and allergic disease. In particular, several large prospective studies have suggested a role for ozone (McDonnell et al. 1999; McConnell et al. 2002) , although significant associations with some asthma outcomes were also shown for PM2.5, soot, and NO 2 (Brauer et al. 2007 ). Nonetheless, although it is clear that air pollution can provoke exacerbations in preexisting asthma and a positive association between outdoor air pollution and asthma prevalence at the population level has been shown , the weight of evidence does not currently support a major role for outdoor air pollution as a cause of the initial development of asthma.",

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Californian EPA concluded that SHS was causally associated with the development of asthma in children (EPA 1992; OEHHA 1997) . The 2006 Surgeon General's report on \"health effects from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke\" (DHHS 2006) concluded that the evidence was suggestive, but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship. This analysis was based on a previous meta-analysis conducted by Strachan and Cook (1998) and did not include the most recent epidemiological studies. However, the more recent meta-analysis including studies published between 1970 and 2005 concluded that household SHS exposure was positively and consistently associated with the incidence or new onset asthma (Vork et al. 2007 ) not only in younger but also older children.",

Estimates of the total proportion of adult asthma which is thought to be occupational in origin range from 2 to 15% in the United States (Chan-Yeung and Malo 1994), 15% in Japan (Chan-Yeung and Malo 1994), 5% in Spain (Kogevinas et al. 1996) , 2% to 3% in New Zealand (Fishwick et al. 1997) , and 2% to 6% in the United Kingdom (Meredith and Nordman 1996) . However, much higher estimates have also been reported. For example, a study of the entire employed population of Finland from 1986 to 1998 estimated the attributable fraction of adult-onset asthma due to occupation to be 29% for men and 17% for women (Karjalainen et al. 2001 ). More than 250 agents have been identified as causes of OA (Department of Health and Senior Services, State of New Jersey 2006).

(2002a) found that antibiotic exposure in early life was associated with an increased risk of asthma diagnosis, but the association was reduced when the data were adjusted for consulting behavior. They also reported that exposure to antibiotics in utero was associated with a dose-related increase in the child's risk of asthma, hay fever, and eczema (McKeever et al. 2002b ). However, Celedon et al. (2004) found no significant association between antibiotic use in the first year of life and the subsequent development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema at age 5 years.

There was a dose-dependent increased risk of current asthma symptoms. However, the association was weaker than that observed for antibiotic use in the same data set (see above; Foliaki et al. 2009 ), and the association reduced (from 1.77 to 1.46) when adjusted for antibiotic use and other asthma risk factors, indicating that the elevated risk was, at least in part, due to confounding.

The global patterns of asthma prevalence are also inconsistent with the hypothesis that air pollution is a major risk factor for the development of asthma (Asher et al. , 2006 Beasley et al. 1998 ). Regions such as China and Eastern Europe where there are some of the highest levels of traditional air pollution such as particulate matter and SO 2 generally have lower asthma prevalence than the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand which have lower levels of pollution. It also appears very unlikely that the international prevalence patterns can be explained by differences in smoking (Mitchell et al. 2002) or in occupational exposures.",

Similarly, Fig. 56 .3 shows data from seven Australian surveys in centers with widely differing levels of mite allergen exposure; the overall prevalences of sensitization and asthma were both unrelated to the levels of house dust mite allergen (Der p 1) exposure in the six centers. The dominant allergen varied between regions, but there was little overall difference in the prevalence of sensitization or of asthma despite the major differences in mite allergen levels. Similarly, von Mutius et al.

The initial interpretation was that growing up in a more hygienic environment with less microbial exposure may enhance atopic (Th 2 / immune responses, whereas microbial pressure would drive the response of the immune system -which is known to be skewed in an atopic Th 2 direction during fetal and perinatal life -into a Th 1 direction and away from its tendency to develop atopic immune responses. More recently, an alternative interpretation has been offered which involves inadequate immunoregulation by T regulatory cells wich control both Th 1 and Th 2 immune responses. Active regulation through T regulatory cells is believed to be critical in maintaining tolerance to allergens through a balanced Th 1 /Th 2 immune response. The hypothesis is that a lack of microbial exposure may result in reduced immune suppression of T regulatory cells allowing upregulation of both Th 1 and Th 2 immunity, thus rendering subjects more susceptible to developing allergies (as well as Th 1 conditions including autoimmune disease which has also increased in prevalence in the past few decades).

(2004b) showed that having had a cat before the age of 18 protected against atopy to outdoor allergens, airway hyperreactivity, current wheeze, and current asthma. These results should, however, be interpreted with caution, since avoidance behavior (removal of pets in the families with sensitized and/or symptomatic children) may have contributed to this inverse association. However, in a longitudinal study in which subjects with childhood asthma at enrolment were excluded from the analyses, the protective effects actually increased (de Meer et al. 2004b) , whereas a decrease would be expected if selective avoidance was a major issue. There are also studies that have found no association, or a positive association, between pet exposure and asthma, despite showing an inverse association with atopy (Apelberg et al. 2001; Kerkhof et al. 2009 ). In other parts of the world (Guinea-Bissau and Nepal), it has been shown that pigs and cattle in the home are associated with less atopy (Shaheen et al. 1996; Melsom et al. 2001) .

These protective effects for allergies and asthma have also been observed in adult farmers (Leynaert et al. 2001; Kauffmann et al. 2002; Kilpelainen et al. 2002; Portengen et al. 2002 Portengen et al. , 2005 Braback et al. 2004; Eduard et al. 2004a, b; Koskela et al. 2005; Radon et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007; Douwes et al. 2007; Smit et al. 2007 Smit et al. , 2008 despite the increased risks of other respiratory conditions such as COPD, reduced lung function, and farmers' lung (Schenker et al. 1998) . The fact that similar effects are found in low-income countries (Weinberg 2000; Viinanen et al. 2007) , where people have less opportunity to move away from farming because of allergies and asthma, further suggests that selection effects are unlikely to explain the often substantial lower risk in farming communities ).",

Farm animals are associated with high exposures to microorganisms, in particular bacterial endotoxin (Douwes et al. 2002b) . Also, an upregulation of several innate immune receptors specific for microbial products (TLRs and CD14) has been shown in farmers' children (Ege et al. 2006) suggesting that microorganisms and microbial products may be involved. In fact, a recent study showed that exposure to a wide variety of environmental microorganisms as well as exposures to specific fungal and bacterial species explained a substantial fraction of the inverse association between farm upbringing and asthma (Ege et al. 2011) . Exposures early in life including the prenatal period appear particularly protective, although continued exposure may be required to maintain optimal protection ).",

Also, although housing conditions are unlikely to have become more hygienic in United States inner city populations, asthma prevalence has increased significantly in those populations, particularly among African Americans living in poverty (Crater et al. 2001 ). Finally, the hygiene hypothesis is unlikely to explain why asthma prevalence is now apparently falling in affluent countries, as exposures to factors that have previously been identified as being \"protective\" (family size, endotoxin exposure, infectious diseases, pets) are likely to have decreased in more recent times rather than increased. These findings thus further emphasize the potential limitations of the current hygiene hypothesis . Nevertheless, whatever mechanism is involved, it is becoming increasingly clear that the \"package\" of changes associated with westernization may be contributing to the global increases in asthma susceptibility and prevalence.",

Until fairly recently and with some notable exceptions, most asthma epidemiology was done by clinicians rather than professional epidemiologists, and epidemiology was largely regarded as a means of \"confirming\" clinically based observations and theories (e.g., that allergens can cause asthma exacerbations and therefore \"must\" also cause asthma itself) ). The field was perhaps comparable to the situation in cardiovascular disease and cancer in the 1950s. For these diseases, the first epidemiological step in exploring the etiology of these conditions involved descriptive epidemiology (\"person, place, and time\"), particularly international prevalence or incidence comparisons such as the MONICA project (Tuomilehto et al. 1987) and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (Doll et al. 1966 ). These naturally led to the development of hypotheses as to the possible explanations for the observed global patterns, which were investigated in analytical studies (cohort and case-control studies), eventually evolving into more complex studies involving the use of biomarkers and genetic testing.",

As a result, we have developed theories of asthma etiology (e.g., the TH 1 /TH 2 theory, and the associated \"hygiene hypothesis\") which work well in mice, but do not seem to work so well in Latin America or inner city populations in the US (see Sect. 56.6.4) (Pearce and Douwes 2006) . In the last couple of decades, epidemiology has played the major role in rectifying this situation, for example, by mounting standardized international prevalence surveys to provide global asthma maps, and other population comparisons (see Sect. 56.5), as a starting point for the more careful and appropriate development of theories of asthma etiology which not only work in the laboratory but which have the potential to explain what is happening in the population context. Of course, such population comparisons are not the solution by themselves, but they are an essential first step in the process of identifying and understanding the causes and etiology of asthma.",

Despite some major therapeutic disasters (Pearce et al. 1998b) , symptoms are relatively easy to control (at least for the eosinophilic phenotype; see Sect. 56.3.1). However, there has not been the same clarity in understanding the etiological mechanisms by which variable airways obstruction occurs, or in the methods used for measuring asthma in prevalence studies . Epidemiology can make an important contribution in the development of a better understanding of the etiology of asthma and whether it constitutes several different conditions or a single condition. This in turn will help to redefine the best methods of defining asthma in clinical practice and in epidemiological surveys.",

Thus, although we have learnt a great deal about immunology in mice in the past few decades, these mouse models have provided only limited understanding of the underlying immunological mechanisms of human asthma. Nonetheless, most biomedical research on asthma continues to be conducted in mice. Similarly, the overemphasis of allergen exposure as the \"causal\" factor of asthma, as well as the lack of appreciation of the heterogeneity of asthma in many epidemiological studies, has guided biomedical and clinical research into studying (almost exclusively) allergic mechanisms and allergy-specific treatment options, with very little consideration of other potentially relevant mechanisms. In particular, there are now several studies suggesting that corticosteroid treatment is less or non-effective in asthma phenotypes that do not involve allergic mechanisms and subsequent non-eosinophilic airway inflammation (Berry et al. 2007) , despite these phenotypes being very common (Douwes et al. 2002a; Simpson et al. 2007) . Also, studies of asthma genetics continue to be based on populations of mixed phenotypes limiting the potential to find meaningful results. This \"tunnel vision\" has led to assumptions that findings in Western countries can be extrapolated to the rest of the world, and it has taken international collaborations such as the ISAAC study, to show that, for example, the strong associations between atopy and asthma symptoms that have been repeatedly observed in Western countries are not so evident in low-and middle-income countries (Weinmayr et al. 2007 ). Thus, considering the complex interplay between environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, immunological mechanisms, as well as social and cultural factors involved in asthma development -and indeed most non-communicable diseases -an interdisciplinary approach bringing together expertise from each of these disciplines is most desirable, as it is likely to open up new avenues of cutting edge research, yielding greater explanatory power, more efficient use of research funding, and more efficient translation into disease prevention. Also, a closer link with biomedical research will ensure the development of more sensitive and valid methods that can be widely applied in population studies to improve both disease definition (including the assessment and recognition of disease phenotypes) and relevant exposures.",

In particular, a large number of potential risk factors for asthma have been identified including genetic factors, allergen exposure, demographic parameters, diet, obesity, indoor and outdoor pollution, passive and active tobacco smoking, occupational exposures, viral infections, stress/anxiety, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen). However, none of these risk factors on their own appears to explain the substantial global increases in asthma prevalence observed in the last few decades. They also cannot explain the significant differences in asthma prevalence between countries. Recent studies have shown that the increase in asthma prevalence appears to have leveled off in many high-income countries, with some even showing a decrease. The reasons for this are also unclear. As a consequence, a single target for intervention has not (yet) been identified.",

            "text": "Understanding why these changes in prevalence are occurring, and ascertaining which elements of the \"package\" of twentieth century economic development and lifestyle changes are responsible, is essential in order to develop effective intervention programs to halt the current global asthma epidemic. Recent epidemiological studies have provided innovative theories of the etiology of asthma, such as the hygiene hypothesis, which have considerable potential to guide the development of feasible primary (and secondary) prevention options. However, given the complex gene-environment interactions (Vercelli 2009 ) and diverse asthma phenotypes (Douwes et al. 2002a) , any single type of intervention is unlikely to prevent all or even a substantial proportion of asthma cases -a \"one size fits all\" approach is unlikely to work. Epidemiology (alongside other disciplines) has a major role to play in developing new theories regarding asthma causation and the subsequent development and evaluation of effective prevention strategies. However, for these efforts to be maximally effective, they would need to be part of a multidisciplinary program that includes expertise (in addition to epidemiology) in biomedical, clinical, genetic, psychological, and other disciplines.",
