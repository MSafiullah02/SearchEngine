Older adults, in particular, are negatively impacted by this pandemic (Lipsitch et al., 2020) . Current estimates suggest that the COVID-19 mortality rate stands at 15% for those over the age of 80, but 0 for those under the age of 10 (Worldometer, 2020b) . Hence, there is no doubt that age poses a major risk for COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, there are incidental reports of centenarians, who recovered from COVID-19, and of younger adults, who have not (Coffey and Oransky, 2020; Lanese and Writer, 2020) . Moreover, the prevalence of younger people infected by the virus is higher than that of older adults (Surveillances, 2020) . Hence, age alone is likely an insufficient criterion for predicting the direct medical impact of the outbreak.",

Ageism is defined as stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination toward people because of their age (Ayalon and Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 2018; Officer and de la Fuente-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 2018) . Although ageism can be both positive and negative (Ayalon and Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 2018) , in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen an out surge of negative manifestations of ageism. Intergenerational tension, characterized as conflict between people of different generations, also has been intensified as a result of the outbreak and has fuelled the response to the pandemic. It is argued here that the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbate and oftentimes supersede its direct medical impact, which to date, has received a substantial amount of research attention (World Health Organization, 2020) .",

In China, where the COVID-19 outbreak had started, the tension between the generations has been manifested in anger toward older adults because of the refusal of some older adults to wear face masks (Eckersley, 2020) . This is consistent with the prediction that at times of scarce resources, symbolic threats, manifested in disputes over values and beliefs, intensify (Stephan and Stephan, 2017) . Overtime, the public focus has shifted to financial donations made by poor older adults, who sacrificed their living in an effort to support the fight against the pandemic. Both in the case of face masks and in the case of financial donations, older adults were portrayed as a separate, homogenous group in society, defined by its chronological age. In the former example, older adults were seen as a threat to society, as they \"selfishly\" refused to conform to current societal practices. In the latter example, on the other hand, older adults were presented as a selfless, yet vulnerable group, which is willing to risk its own being in order to help society at large.",

The single most lethal combination cocktail is when grandma meets her grandchild and hugs him\" (Gross and TOI Staff, 2020) . This statement explicitly argues for an age division between the generations and portrays intergenerational contact as THE problem. Following the same logic, in the UK, the first response to the outbreak was \"business as usual.\" In fact, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had suggested that older adults over the age of 70 should self-isolate for a period of 4 months, while all other age groups continue as usual (Sparrow, 2020) . A similar approach has been advocated in other countries, which had stressed the importance of socially isolating older adults, rather than the entire population (Armitage and Nellums, 2020) . This approach was attributed to the fact that older adults already have their pensions and thus are not likely to be impacted financially by social isolation.",

The Brexit in the UK (Banaji and Mejias, 2018) , voting rights for those whose life expectancy is lower than 18 years in Germany (Maschiach, 2019) , or the climate change have been depicted as sources of intergenerational divide with the younger generations blaming older adults for \"stealing their future\" (Morrison, 2020) . The social isolation and abandonment of older adults are not new and have been noted in other emergency situations, such as the Chicago 1995 heat wave, for instance (Klinenberg, 2015) . In fact, the higher vulnerability of older adults in the face of emergency situations has been attributed to their limited social capital, defined by the quantity and quality of informal (e.g. friends and family) and formal (e.g. community and volunteers) social ties (Durant Jr, 2011) . When social isolation and intergenerational distancing are promoted as the norm, as in the case in the current pandemic, older adults' ability to face natural atrocities deteriorates even further.",

There is a high variability in old age, which in fact becomes even greater as people grow older (Lowsky et al., 2014) . This should be acknowledged and guide the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Decisions concerning the rationing of treatment should not be based solely on chronological age. Instead, people's values and preferences as well as shortterm outcomes should be taken into consideration (Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences, 2020). Moreover, old age should not be automatically equated with vulnerability and dependency, as this results in substantial harm to people's perceptions of their own aging selves and intensifies the division between the generations. An alternative framing, which portrays the negative implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on all member of society, regardless of their chronological age, should be advocated.",

We should also avoid using terms such as social distancing and instead use the more neutral term physical distancing. The latter term implies that while for our safety, physical contact might be minimal to non-existent, social contact should be maintained and even strengthened. In fact, social capital (Durant Jr, 2011) , including intergenerational contact, is a major asset in emergency situations and its absence makes older adults particularly vulnerable.",
