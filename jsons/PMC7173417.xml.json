The RNA genome is the template for synthesis of additional RNA strands (a molecule of RNA is the template and molecules of RNA are produced). During replication of RNA viruses, there are at least three types of RNA that must be synthesized: the genome, a copy of the genome (copy genome), and mRNAs. Some RNA viruses also synthesize copies of subgenomic mRNAs. RdRp is the key player for all of these processes (Fig. 10.1\n).",

Positive or plus (+)-strand RNA viruses have genomes that are functional mRNAs (Table 10.1\n). Upon penetration into the host cell, ribosomes assemble on the genome to synthesize viral proteins. Genomes of positive-strand RNA viruses are single-stranded molecules of RNA and may be capped and polyadenylated. During the replication cycle of positive-strand RNA viruses, among the first proteins to be synthesized are those needed to synthesize additional genomes and mRNAs. Thus the infecting genome has two functions: It is an mRNA and also serves as the template for synthesis of additional viral RNAs.

They actively modify host cell membranes to construct viral replication scaffolds. Positive-strand RNA viruses of animals also use a common strategy to express RdRp. RdRp is a nonstructural protein, meaning that it is not found within the assembled virion. Instead it is translated directly from the infecting genome shortly after penetration. RdRp and other viral proteins needed for viral RNA synthesis are encoded as a polyprotein that is cleaved by virally encoded proteases. In the case of the picornaviruses and the flaviviruses, all viral proteins (structural and nonstructural) are synthesized as part of a single long polyprotein. Other positive-strand RNA viruses (i.e., togaviruses, coronaviruses, arteriviruses) synthesize an RdRp-containing polyprotein from genome-length mRNA, but use subgenomic mRNAs to encode structural and other proteins.",

            "text": "There are three additional groups of RNA viruses whose genomes are not mRNAs. They are the negative or minus (\u2212)-strand RNA viruses, the closely related ambisense RNA viruses, and double-stranded RNA viruses (Table 10.2\nand Box 10.2\n). For each of these groups of viruses, the first synthetic event after genome penetration is transcription (Fig. 10.3\n). This is accomplished by viral proteins (including viral RdRp) that enter cell with the genome. Transcription/replication complexes usually contain between two and four proteins. They associate with the genome through interactions with RNA-binding nucleocapsid (N) or capsid proteins. Therefore, naked (purified away from protein) genomic RNA is not infectious, cannot be translated, and will eventually be degraded if transcription is blocked. Before genome replication can proceed, viral mRNAs must be transcribed and translated. Because the virion of a negative-strand RNA virus contains RdRp, it is possible to synthesize viral mRNAs in a test tube (Fig. 10.4\n). If purified virions are gently lysed under appropriate buffer conditions, with the addition of NTPs, mRNAs will be transcribed in the test tube. However, genome RNA will not be synthesized under these conditions (Table 10.1).

DNA sequences (promoters) direct RNA polymerases to the \u201ccorrect\u201d position on the DNA genome. Promoters can be quite long and complex and promoter regions themselves are not transcribed. What mechanisms do viral RdRps use to prime viral RNA synthesis? It is particularly important, in the case of genome synthesis, that genetic information not be lost or modified; however, mRNAs are often capped and polyadenylated. Are the methods for priming viral mRNA synthesis the same or different from the methods of priming genome replication? The RNA viruses seem to have experimented widely. Various mechanisms by which RdRps initiate RNA synthesis are described below.\u2022De novo or primer-independent transcription and replication employs the RdRp, the RNA template, an initiation NTP, and a second NTP. The initial NTP can be considered the primer. The initial complex is not highly stable.\u2022De novo initiation is sometimes used to generate short RNA oligonucleotides that are subsequently used as primers in a mechanism known as prime and realign. The short internally initiated oligos slip back to extend from 5\u2032 end of the template. Bunyaviruses and arenaviruses use this process. As a result the 5\u2032 ends of the genome and copy genome contain nontemplated nucleotides.\u2022RNA structures such as hairpins can be used for priming in a process where the 3\u2032 end of the template RNA loops back upon itself to serve as the primer. This process is \u201ctemplate priming\u201d as part of the template (the genome) functions as the primer.\u2022Some RNA viruses (i.e., picornaviruses) use a protein to prime RNA replication. A tyrosine hydroxyl group on the primer protein (VPg) is linked to GTP to serve as the first nucleotide in the new strand. The protein interactions between VPg, RdRp, and the RNA template form a stable initiation complex (Chapter 11: Family Picornaviridae).\u2022Some RNA viruses (for example, influenza viruses) \u201csteal\u201d short (10\u201315 nt) capped oligonucleotides from cellular mRNAs to prime viral mRNA synthesis (a process called cap-snatching) (Chapter 23: Family Orthomyxoviridae). This priming process cannot be used for genome synthesis and indeed, the genome segments of influenza viruses are primed by a de novo process.\n",

The fidelity of RdRps has been studied and they generate transition mutations at a frequency of 10\u22123\u201310\u22125 (one transition mutation for every 103\u2013105 nt synthesized) and transversion mutations at a frequency of 10\u22126\u201310\u22127 (one transversion mutation for every 106\u2013107 nt synthesized). A rate of one mutation per 105 nucleotides synthesized ensures that during an infection, many progeny will contain a mutation. The significance of the quasispecies model for RNA viruses is that there is no single \u201cfittest\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d genome sequence. The population is fitter than the individual (Box 10.3\n).Box 10.3RNA Virus Quasispecies and FitnessThe RdRps of RNA viruses control RNA synthesis error rates. Molecular/biochemical studies have revealed that RdRp mutations can have a measurable impact on fidelity and this in turn measurably impacts virus fitness. A well-studied example is polio virus (PV) a picornavirus. Vignuzzi et al. (2006) characterized a PV mutant with a high-fidelity polymerase. While the mutant replicated as well as the wild-type virus (produced equivalent numbers of virions), there was measurably less diversity in the population. The less diverse population performed poorly, when compared to the wild-type virus, when exposed to adverse growth conditions. (Adverse conditions included exposure to an antiviral drug in cultured cells and inoculation into mice.) The more diverse population was more adaptable and fit under these circumstances!Based on this result, it might be tempting to assume that a PV mutant with a less faithful RdRp (generating a more highly mutated, thus diverse population) would have increased fitness compared with wild-type PV. However this is not the case, as demonstrated in a study published by Korboukh et al. (2014). These researchers identified a PV with a single amino acid substitution in the RdRp that produced a \u201cmutator phenotype.\u201d The progeny population was 2\u20133 fold more diverse than the wild-type population. This mutant population could not compete with the wild-type population and was driven to extinction in direct competition studies. Thus increasing the wild-type mutation rate was also deleterious. There were simply too many mutations in each genome produced; the progeny were not viable.While these studies might seem esoteric, they actually provide practical and valuable insights. For example, they have led to proposals that drugs to increase RdRp error rates (as opposed to inhibiting these enzymes) will increase RNA virus mutation rates to a catastrophic level. On the other hand, attenuated vaccine strains might be engineered to have more faithful RdRps thereby decreasing their ability to revert to virulence (Fig. 10.6).",

The RdRp always initiates mRNA synthesis at the very 3\u2032 end of the genome. After polyadenylating an upstream mRNA, RdRp must remain associated with the genome to initiate synthesis of the downstream mRNA. If the RdRp dissociates from the genome, it cycles back to the 3\u2032 end to reinitiate transcription. Because RdRp does often dissociate from the genome during transcription, the downstream genes are produced in lower quantities. Note that the N protein (a structural protein required in large amounts) is positioned at the 3\u2032 end of the genome while the L protein (the RdRp), an enzyme is positioned at the 5\u2032 end of the genome.",
