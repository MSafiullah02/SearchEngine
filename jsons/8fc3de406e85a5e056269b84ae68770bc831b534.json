We offer detailed perioperative management strategies and present a specific protocol designed to improve safety during pediatric laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. Several methods of using disposable drapes for various procedures are described, with the goal of constructing a tent around the patient to decrease widespread contamination of dispersed droplets and generated aerosol. The concepts presented herein are translatable to future situations where aerosol generating procedures increase risk for any pathogenic exposure.

            "text": "The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, instigated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Despite the fatality rate appearing to be lower for COVID -19 than other coronavirus outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the elevated transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, long incubation period and asymptomatic spread have resulted in a large number of deaths, quickly surpassing the combined totals of the SARS and MERS outbreaks. [1] Transmission to healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 was described as early as January 2020, which soon translated to healthcare provider deaths. [2, 3] The first reported physician death related to COVID-19 was an otolaryngologist in Wuhan, China. [4] Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients are thought to be responsible for the rapid spread of COVID-19, accounting for up to 79% of documented cases. [5] Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from these patients is common because viral shedding begins before the onset of symptoms. [6] [7] [8] The airway of infected patients has been shown to have a high viral load, especially in the nose, throat and trachea. [9] Otolaryngologists, oral surgeons, dentists, ophthalmologists, and anesthesiologists are among those at highest risk for infection, given the procedures they perform in or near the upper aerodigestive tract. Additionally, airway procedures often result in aerosolization of viral product, placing all healthcare workers present during these procedures at high risk for infection. [10] Various societies have recommended that only essential procedures be performed and that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is required during the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.entuk.org/covid -19) . [11] Appropriate PPE for all airway procedures should include, at minimum, an N95 respirator, face shield, gown, cap, and gloves that cover the gown. [4] There have been reports of practitioners donning PPE, including an N95 respirator, who have still been infected with COVID-19 during aerosolization procedures such as sinus surgery. [10] The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends prioritizing negative pressure rooms and powered, airpurifying respirators (PAPRs) for aerosol-generating procedures (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html).",

Protocols have been proposed to help protect healthcare workers and their patients in the setting of necessary aerosol-generating procedures including a reusable acrylic barrier enclosure during standard intubation. [12] While having a reusable barrier saves on resources, it may be difficult to fully disinfect and could potentially spread the virus across patients. Other groups have provided extremely helpful broad insights on how to manage various necessary high-risk otolaryngologic procedures during the current pandemic, including rigid microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB). [13, 14] In this article, we offer further detailed perioperative management strategies and present a novel specific protocol designed to improve safety by decreasing intraoperative aerosolized viral product during pediatric MLB by utilizing disposable drapes to create a contained tent immediately around the patient. While this protocol was developed to be used during the COVID 19 pandemic, the concepts are likely translatable to any future pandemic where aerosol generating procedures increase risk of pathogenic exposure. This protocol is the result of a collaborative effort between pediatric otolaryngologists, anesthesiologists, occupational medicine specialists, nursing staff and medical engineers from Children's Hospital Colorado, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and Boston Children's Hospital.",

However, donning PPE is essential for MLBs because they are high-risk procedures for aerosolization from an open airway unsecured by an endotracheal tube (ETT) that can place all operating room staff at risk for infection. Therefore, preoperative planning is imperative to avoid unnecessary procedures. Surgeries should be evaluated and ensured to fulfill the following criteria: The surgery is 1) potentially life-saving, 2) may prevent rapid patient deterioration, 3) may prevent permanent disability or dysfunction, or 4) failure to perform the surgery may lead to metastatic or infectious progression. We recommend open discourse between physicians for each case so that various opinions may be solicited, and a consensus agreement achieved regarding the need to proceed. Airway foreign bodies and critical airway obstruction are two presentations that fulfill these criteria.",

Currently, there is variability across institutions with respect to access to testing, duration of testing, and reliability of results including false negative rates that at some institutions may be as high as 30-40%. [15] Protocols from northern Italy include obtaining a chest x-ray and oximetry for preoperative patients who screen negative for COVID-19 to capture false negative cases (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ_IYo44Ixs). While a negative test is insufficient to negate the need for intraoperative airborne precautions given the risk of false negatives and a high-risk procedure, it may decrease the need for pre-and post-operative airborne isolation, thereby preserving limited PPE.",

While many centers perform MLB to evaluate for and remove an airway foreign body, there are frequently \"negative\" bronchoscopies where no foreign body is found. [16] To minimize negative bronchoscopies during the current COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend considering low-dose, non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) to confirm the presence of a foreign body if the patient is an appropriate candidate and does not require general anesthesia to obtain the imaging. CT imaging as a first investigation in suspected airway foreign body has routinely been used prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. [17] It has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific to identify foreign bodies and to decrease negative bronchoscopy rates. [18] If a foreign body is absent and clinical suspicion remains low, the surgery can be cancelled, and the patient can be followed closely as an outpatient. CT imaging may also be used to gloves that cover the gown sleeves, and shoe covers should also be used by all. Some have suggested wearing two gowns and two gloves for these procedures. A neck covering that can be doffed without contamination should be considered. Again, this approach is not dependent on COVID-19 test results given that this is a high-risk aerosolization procedure.",

[19] Only essential personnel should be in the operating room to decrease unnecessary healthcare worker exposure and PPE use. Unfortunately, this will mean limiting trainee participation in cases involving an unsecured airway if the procedure can be safely done without the trainee's presence. We have been able to complete these procedures with only an attending anesthesiologist, attending surgeon, circulating nurse, and scrub nurse/technician, all of whom remain in the room for the duration of the procedure. This does not mean that limiting resource expenditure should outweigh patient safety. All necessary resources including personnel and PPE may be utilized to safely complete each case, but care must be given to limit unnecessary waste. The procedures may also be filmed where appropriate and the videos may be used for trainee education. Operating room doors must remain closed to prevent viral spread. Internal and external communication from the OR is essential to decrease the need for repeated door opening.

If deemed safe, preoperative sedation may calm the patient to facilitate intravenous line placement or mask induction. The anesthesiologist may wish to use an aerosol/droplet barrier between him or her and the patient. If positive pressure ventilation using a facemask is required, it should be performed with low fresh gas flows, small tidal volumes and low ventilatory pressures, using a two-handed technique. After induction, airway management depends on the nature of the procedure being performed. We recommend the placement of a supraglottic airway device or a cuffed endotracheal tube prior to draping the patient to minimize air leak during the draping process. A poorly seated supraglottic airway device may not seal the airway and result in aerosolized particles leaking around it, so a cuffed ETT may be used if not contraindicated. A standard blade videolaryngoscope is favored over a standard laryngoscope for airway exposure as it increases the mouth-to-mouth distance between the patient and anesthesiologist or surgeon ( Figure   2 ).

Regardless of the type of drape and suspensory equipment selected, the principle aim is to create a surgical tent that acts as a barrier to decrease widespread dissemination of aerosolized viral product once the airway is unsecured during bronchoscopy. The smoke evacuator continually removes aerosolized viral product underneath the surgical tent and decreases oxygen accumulation, thereby reducing the risk of a surgical fire. If suspension laryngoscopy will be required for a supraglottoplasty or intratracheal procedure, a microscope drape can be attached to the microscope lens and then inverted over the patient and surgical table instead of draping the microscope. The microscope is then available for use as needed during the procedure (Figure 4 ). All drapes should cover the patient and operating room table with the open end directed towards the patient's feet. The airway and suction circuits are all passed through the open end. We do not recommend fully enveloping the patient in the drape because it needs to be removed easily at the end of the case to prevent spread of settled viral particles.",

To do so, either cut a 12-inch working hole in the clear drape near the top of the patient's head, or cut two small slits approximately 1.5 feet apart and gently slide draped arms through the opening(s) (www.ORLPED.com/covid-19-or-draping). The scrub nurse can also don sleeves and insert their arms into the side of the tent to pass instruments safely to and from the surgeon.",

To insert the flexible bronchoscope, a swivel adapter with tape or a Tegaderm (Tegaderm, 3M, MN, USA) covering the diaphragm opening is attached to the LMA or ETT. A hole is punctured in the tape or Tegaderm and flexible bronchoscopy is performed through the closed airway circuit to minimize leak and aerosolization. Lidocaine may be administered to the vocal cords and carina through the flexible bronchoscope.",

If no PPE monitor is available, having a written doffing protocol to follow or implementing a buddy system whereby each person watches and coaches the other while doffing can be helpful.

The additional equipment required can be easily found in most operating rooms or institutions and modifications can be made where required. The principles are sound to decrease aerosolization and droplet contamination in the operating room. This protocol imparts little to no added risk to the patient, as the drapes may be rapidly removed if the patient decompensates or other concerns arise.

Intraoperative Protocol 3.1 Prior to Procedure This protocol was developed to protect healthcare workers and to decrease widespread environmental contamination by containing aerosolized viral product in a surgical tent created from clear surgical drapes immediately surrounding the patient (Figure 1). Even with this surgical barrier in place, procedures should be performed in a negative pressure room if possible. The surgeon and all operating room staff should be in full PPE for airborne precautions, preferably with PAPRs where available or fittested N95 masks with face shields if PAPRs are not available.

A drape or surgical towel is placed under the patient's head and a clear 1010 drape (3M, MN, USA) is placed over the patient's chin, neck and chest. As an alternative, an aperture drape (1020, 1030; 3M, MN, USA) can be used with the aperture positioned to expose the mouth while the drape covers the rest of the patient. An ultrafiltration smoke evacuator is secured to the clear drape on the patient's chest with the open end facing towards the patient's head. This device filters viral particles as small as 52-55 nm (HPV) and, therefore, should be effective at filtering the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has a diameter of approximately 120 nm. Placing a surgical towel between the evacuator opening and the drape prevents the latter from being suctioned into the evacuator. The smoke evacuator must be used in addition to the normal surgical suction due to the sheer volume of air that it can clear. This is far superior to the normal surgical suction alone as demonstrated in the following video (https://youtu.be/J6U1iamfZ0A). An ether screen is then placed over the patient at the level of the chest and secured to the operating room table. As alternatives, a mayo stand with tray removed or IV poles may be used if an ether screen is unavailable. A second ether screen or mayo stand may be positioned 8-12 inches above the patient's abdomen. A clear impermeable surgical drape is then placed over the patient's head and body, and suspended by the ether screen(s).
