The development of viral pseudotypes and virus-like particles (VLPs) has made research and drug discovery into virus entry and uncoating possible at a reduced containment level [13] [14] [15] . By contrast, analysis of subgenomic replicons enables uncoupling of viral replication, transcription and translation from virus assembly, host cell egress, entry and uncoating. Replicons are broadly defined as autonomously replicating DNA or RNA molecules, whereas viral subgenomic replicons are usually produced by deletion of one or more genes coding for structural proteins or insertion of or replacement by a reporter gene and/or selectable marker [16] [17] [18] [19] . Replicons have been made possible by the advent of reverse genetics: a process of storage and manipulation of entire viral genomes hosted on plasmids, and the recreation of viral RNA genomes by in vitro or in vivo transcription of these plasmids. In cases where replicons cannot be established, plasmid-driven coexpression of replication factors necessary to drive replication of a reporter RNA create minimal replication systems termed minigenomes. These reporter RNAs usually contain the genomic 5\u2032 and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) which are essential for replication, transcription and translation. Whereas most replicons can be maintained in cell lines by antibiotic selection and passed on during cell division, minigenomes based on plasmid transfection have a limited lifespan and need to be recreated before experimentation. Although not exhaustive, Table 1 lists established replicons and minigenome systems for many medically relevant viruses. Since their conception, replicons and minigenomes have been used in low-and high-throughput screens of compound libraries, to elucidate the biological mechanisms of drug action and to screen for drug escape-mutants arising in the replicon-harbouring cell pool owing to generally poor fidelity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). This review will briefly cover the modern success story of the establishment and use of subgenomic replicons in the development of drugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and then illustrate the potential of dengue virus, togavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and norovirus replicons, and the Ebola virus minigenome, in the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors.

Most HCV strains will not establish productive infection in cell culture and it was not until 2005 that JFH-1 was shown to be the first strain that could be propagated in a cell culture system without adaptive mutations [26, 27] . To overcome this limitation, in 1999 Lohmann et al. defined NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B as the minimal set of HCV proteins necessary to facilitate autonomous replication by replacement of the coding region for Core, Envelope protein 1 and 2, p7 and NS2 with a neomycin resistance cassette. Expression of NS3-NS5B was driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES), establishing a bicistronic HCV replicon [18] (Figure 1a ). This development started DAA discovery which eventually led to the licensing in 2011 of first-generation DAAs boceprevir and telaprevir, both NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Replicons were used to assess efficacy and bioavailability of drug candidates, as well as analysis of escape mutants during discovery and optimisation of candidates, reviewed in [28, 29] . However, boceprevir and telaprevir act on HCV genotype 1 only, making development of subgenomic replicons of other genotypes necessary to facilitate discovery of drugs acting on some or all genotypes. To date, subgenomic replicons have been developed for HCV strains 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5a and 6a to ensure testing of pan-genotype effectiveness of drug candidates [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . These replicon systems have aided in the development of second-generation DAAs such as ledipasvir, acting on the viral NS5A regulatory protein, and sofosbuvir, a nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrug inhibiting the NS5B polymerase [36, 37] .
