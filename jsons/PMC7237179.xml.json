However, limited data are available on factors independently associated with mortality. In The Lancet, Matthew Cummings and colleagues10 add to our knowledge by reporting the results of a prospective cohort study describing clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of 257 critically ill patients (87 [34%] women and 170 [66%] men, median age 62 years) admitted to high-dependency and intensive care units in two hospitals in New York City over a period of 4 weeks. Notably, critically ill patients with COVID-19 represented 22% of all patients admitted.",

This could be explained by the high incidence of obesity, which affected 39 (71%) of those 55 younger patients. Other common comorbidities were hypertension (162 [63%]), diabetes (92 [36%]), chronic cardiovascular disease (49 [19%]), chronic kidney disease (37 [14%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (24 [9%]). 203 (79%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, median respiratory system compliance was low (26 mL/cm water), and all patients required a high fraction of inspired oxygen despite having relatively high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (median 15 cm water). Although obesity might have affected the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, these findings underline that the optimal management of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure remains poorly understood.",

In particular, it shows that the disease is characterised by a high mortality (101 [39%] after a minimum follow-up of 28 days) and prolonged clinical course, as shown by the high percentage of patients still in the hospital (94 [37%]) at the end of follow-up. The multivariable Cox model analysis showed that history of chronic pulmonary disease had the highest adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for mortality (aHR 2\u00b794 [95% CI 1\u00b748\u20135\u00b784]). Other independent predictors of death were history of chronic cardiovascular disease (aHR 1\u00b776 [95% CI 1\u00b708\u20132\u00b786]), older age (aHR 1\u00b731 [95% CI 1\u00b709\u20131\u00b757]), higher concentrations of IL-6 (aHR 1\u00b711 [95% CI 1\u00b702\u20131\u00b720] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1\u00b710 [95% CI 1\u00b701\u20131\u00b719] per decile increase) on admission. There appear to be no differences by sex. The association of mortality with higher concentrations of IL-6 and D-dimer is particularly relevant for two reasons. First, it confirms the key pathogenic role played by the activation of systemic inflammation and endothelial-vascular damage in the development of organ dysfunction. Second, it provides the rationale for the design of clinical trials for measuring the efficacy of treatment with immunomodulating and anticoagulant drugs.",
