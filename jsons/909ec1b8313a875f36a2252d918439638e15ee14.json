Veling, MD b Most otolaryngologists see pediatric patients and treat disorders associated with chronic upper respiratory inflammation (rhinitis, otitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis) as a routine part of their practice. In 2009, otolaryngologists were surveyed by telephone as part of the Pediatric Allergies in America Survey. Otolaryngologists estimated that they saw 43 patients aged 4 to 17 years per week and that 41% were diagnosed with AR. 1 Pillsbury and colleagues 2 noted that AR was the most common International Classification of Diseases-9 code used by otolaryngologists in a workforce study conducted in 2000. Because allergy is a common contributor of upper airway inflammation, a working knowledge of pediatric allergy is beneficial in the evaluation and treatment of children presenting to otolaryngologists. Upper and lower airway inflammation is linked epidemiologically and physiologically. 3 Therefore, considering and appropriately identifying coexisting lower respiratory inflammation (eg, asthma) is also logical. Identifying asthma in otolaryngology patients is especially compelling because unmanaged asthma impairs quality of life and can be fatal. It is also likely that asthma is underdiagnosed and undertreated. 4 This article informs the otolaryngologist about the development, manifestations, and treatment of allergy in pediatric patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 41, "end": 45, "text": "MD b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 479, "end": 480, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 943, "end": 944, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1275, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inhalant Allergies in Children"}, {"text": "Atopy is the predisposition to develop allergic diseases. The phenotype of allergy seems to have a complicated and variable genetic contribution. Gene-environment interactions have been identified, 5 and add another layer of variability to the development of allergic disease. There is no single genetic test to identify if an individual is likely to be atopic. Genetic studies looking at single nucleotide polymorphism have focused primarily on allergic inflammatory cells and mediators. Although hundreds of associations have been identified, each alone tends to be difficult to reproduce or represents only a small percentage of allergic individuals. 6 Large genome-wide association studies use a hypothesis-independent strategy to identify which genes are statistically different between an affected and nonaffected population. In asthma, genome-wide association studies have identified a small number of genes, such as ORMDL3, 7, 8 of which the functions remain unclear. Currently, the allergy phenotype probably represents multiple and variable combinations of genetic predispositions many of which require a specific environmental interaction to be manifested. So far, the genes identified suggest alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity play a significant role in allergic disease. 9 As suggested by the complicated genetics, family history of allergy is a risk factor, but inheritance does not follow a simple pattern. For AR, family history of atopy is one of several risk factors that include cigarette exposure; higher socioeconomic class; first-born or only child; and elevated total IgE (>100 IU/L) before age 6 years. 10 In the Danish twin study of asthma by Skadhauge and coworkers, 11 the proban-wise concordance of monozygotic males to develop asthma was 0.51 (0.39-0.63), whereas dizygotic opposite sex twins was only 0.07 (0.03-0.11). Another study showed that of those with one asthmatic parent, 26% developed asthma. Of note, maternal history was more predictive. 12 Although not definitive, asking about allergies in first-degree relatives is useful in the evaluation of a child with chronic upper or lower respiratory inflammation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 199, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 654, "end": 655, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 932, "end": 934, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 935, "end": 936, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1300, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1644, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1710, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 1997, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GENETICS"}, {"text": "There have been multiple studies investigating if variables in pregnancy affect the later development of allergies including the time of year the child is born, maternal diet, or route of delivery. One study suggested that North American children born in the late fall have a higher risk of developing asthma. 13 This is attributed to the role of winter respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, occurring in the first few months of life increasing the risk of asthma. However, the authors are not aware of any recommendations advising timing of pregnancy based on allergy risk because studies are conflicting and the overall evidence insufficient. Restricting maternal diet in pregnancy from proallergic foods has been shown not to affect the development of atopy in the child. 14 Some studies have shown some protection from atopy in children delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean section. 15 The affect is attributed to the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which is discussed later. IgE in cord blood has also been of interest. Nonspecific IgE is produced in utero starting around 11 weeks gestation, but specific IgE is first identified after birth. Initial reports of IgE levels in cord blood predicting atopy have not been supported in later prospective studies. 16 Difficulties in identifying children at high risk for allergy beyond parental allergic history complicates research aimed at attempting to prevent the development of allergic disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 310, "end": 312, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 932, "end": 934, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1300, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IN UTERO"}, {"text": "Although inhalant allergy is not prevalent during the first 2 years of life, there are clues in infancy as to the risk of later developing inhalant allergic disease.

Attention has been focused on T-helper cell lymphocytes because they direct much of the immunologic response to antigens. Stimulated T-helper lymphocytes produce different cytokine profiles that are broadly classified as Th1 or Th2 (a Th3 phenotype has also been described). 17, 18 Th1 cytokines primarily influence the immune system to act against bacteria and include interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-g. Th2 cytokines direct activity more appropriate toward parasites. The Th2 influence toward IgE and eosinophils also occurs in allergic inflammation. Th2 cytokines include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. At birth, T-helper lymphocytes are Th2 biased (or allergy biased), and as the immune system develops the T-helper cells change to a Th1 bias. The \"hygiene hypothesis\" suggests that challenges to the immune system early in life facilitate the shift to a Th1 bias, which protects against allergy. Infections early in life, 19 or increased risk of infections represented by exposure to siblings or by early entry into daycare, 20 have been associated with a decreased risk of later developing allergic disease. Some studies of T lymphocytes from infants at high risk for atopy have shown not only bias toward Th2, but also a decreased production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. It may be that the greater reduction of stimulated Th1 cytokines accounts for most of the imbalance compared with controls. 21 Paradoxically, as infancy has become more sanitized in developed countries, atopy has become more prevalent. The reason for the increase in allergy is likely to be more complicated than the \"hygiene hypothesis\" alone and multiple competing theories from changes in exposures, to nutrition, to air pollution exist.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 403, "end": 406, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 407, "end": 409, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1051, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1154, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1528, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFANCY: 0 TO 2 YEARS"}, {"text": "Manifestations of allergy in infancy include food allergy and atopic dermatitis, which are both risk factors for the later development of inhalant allergy. Food allergy is commonly seen in infants and is frequently the first identifier of the atopic child. 22 Ten percent of 1 year olds have an elevated IgE to a food, most commonly milk or egg. 23 Infants with milk or egg food allergy are at increased risk for developing AR and asthma. 23, 24 Atopic dermatitis is another marker of atopy in infancy. Atopic dermatitis in infancy frequently presents as pruritic eczema of the cheeks and flexural surfaces of the elbows and knees. Infants with atopic dermatitis have a 30% risk of developing asthma and a 35% risk of developing AR. 25, 26 Early sensitization to inhalant allergies in infancy occurs, but infrequently. Herr and colleagues 27 used a standardized questionnaire in 1850 infants at their 18th-month examination to identify children with AR-like symptoms defined as runny nose, blocked nose, and sneezing apart from a cold. Of the 1850 infants, 9.1% were found to have AR-like symptoms. All children were then assessed with a specific inhalant IgE screen, total IgE, and eosinophilia. There was no difference in eosinophilia or total IgE in the \"AR-like symptoms\" group compared with the \"no AR-like symptoms\" group. Inhalant-specific IgE was elevated in 5.5% with AR-like symptoms versus 2.7% (P 5 .04) of those without symptoms. However, the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines include both specific IgE sensitization and symptoms in the definition of AR. 28 Only 9 of the 1850 children had both AR-like symptoms and elevated inhalant-specific IgE. In comparison, there were 43 of 1850 infants with elevated inhalant-specific IgE that were identified in the \"no AR-like symptoms group.\" This suggests that AR is rare at 18 months of age and that screening infants for elevated specific IgE would lack specificity in identifying infants with clinical symptoms. Of interest, five of the nine infants with both AR-like symptoms and inhalantspecific IgE elevation were sensitized to dust mite. 28 Although AR is uncommon in infancy, viral rhinitis is prevalent. Children less than 6 years old average six to eight \"colds\" annually with symptoms lasting 10-14 days. 29 Rhinovirus accounted for 46% of childhood upper respiratory infections in one study. 30 Distinguishing between AR and viral rhinitis is clinically significant because a physician might reasonably treat an infant with AR with antihistamines, but antihistamines have been demonstrated as ineffective compared with placebo in viral rhinitis. 31 Lower respiratory inflammation in infants has a similar clinical dilemma in differentiating viral bronchiolitis from asthma. Viral bronchiolitis (wheezing and tachypnea) accounts for outpatient visits in 15% of infants and 3% are hospitalized. 32 The common causes include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. Viral-triggered asthma and bronchiolitis are difficult to distinguish from each other, but viral-triggered asthma tends to occur in children who have multiple wheezing episodes, are older than 2 years, and have a family history of atopy. 33 Once children are older than 2 years, an association between viral-induced wheezing and asthma risks (elevation in inhalant-specific IgE, maternal asthma history) becomes significant. 34 The clinical distinction between bronchiolitis and asthma affects pharmacologic treatment. Although bronchodilators and corticosteroids are mainstays of asthma treatment, neither bronchodilators 35,36 nor corticosteroids 37 have been shown to be effective in uncomplicated viral bronchiolitis (discussed later).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 259, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 346, "end": 348, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 439, "end": 442, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 443, "end": 445, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 733, "end": 736, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 737, "end": 739, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1597, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2131, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2302, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2390, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2642, "end": 2644, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2891, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3233, "end": 3235, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3420, "end": 3422, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3644, "end": 3646, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFANCY: 0 TO 2 YEARS"}, {"text": "Attenuating the development of allergy through environmental manipulation has not been very successful.

The effect on quality of life is subdivided into either \"mild disease\" (no impairment of daily activities, no sleep interruption, and no troublesome symptoms) or \"moderate to severe disease\" (one or more of the previously mentioned symptoms). Other guidelines (and the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) divide AR into seasonal and perennial. 54 AR is estimated to affect 60 million people in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing. 55 The prevalence of AR in children is possibly as high as 40%, 56 making it the most common chronic disease in the pediatric population. However, whether AR is self-described, physician diagnosed, or includes allergy testing affects the reported incidence and prevalence. 27 Additionally, there is profound geographic variability. 57 Most individuals develop symptoms of AR before 20 years of age, with 40% of patients becoming symptomatic by age 6 years. In adults diagnosed with AR, 40% have perennial AR and 20% have seasonal AR; an additional 40% have perennial AR with seasonal flare-ups. 10 The recently published Pediatric Allergies in America Survey suggests that children are more likely to have seasonal allergies compared with perennial AR. 1 The most common triggers of nasal symptoms in the allergic children were pollen, dust, and animal dander.

Family and twin studies have indicated that genetics play an important role in the development of allergy and asthma. Twin studies suggest that approximately 60% of asthma susceptibility is caused by genetic factors, with indicators of allergic sensitization, such as serum IgE levels, also demonstrating heritability. 89 Genome-wide linkage studies and case-control studies have identified 18 genomic regions and more than 100 genes associated with allergy and asthma. 9 Recently, the gene ORMDL3 has been identified as exhibiting a highly significantly association with asthma, a finding that has been replicated in several populations. 90 Although genetic predisposition is clearly evident, environmental factors also play a large role in asthma susceptibility and are likely to underlie the increases that have occurred in recent decades. 91 Observations of migrating populations and of Germany after unification have strongly supported the role of local environmental factors in determining the degree of expression of asthma within genetically similar populations. 92 During early childhood, certain viruses have been associated with the development of the asthmatic phenotype. In a landmark 2008 study, Jackson and colleagues 93 showed that wheezing with rhinovirus at age 3 years was more predictive of asthma at age 6 years (OR, 25.6) than aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.4). Respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza are among viral pathogens associated with wheezing in the first few years of life. 94 In contrast, exposure of an infant to a substantial number of infections, as suggested by the hygiene hypothesis, is seen as protective against the development of the asthma phenotype. 95 Although this theory has been supported by some studies of allergy prevalence, 96 it has been partially refuted by recent studies of asthma prevalence suggesting that although large family size (more than four children) is associated with a decreased risk of asthma, birth order is not involved. 97 Wheezing and asthma are not synonymous in children. Although some 50% of preschool children have wheezing with viral respiratory infections, only 10% to 15% have a diagnosis of asthma by the time they reach school age. 98 Wheezing in early infancy and childhood has been divided into three courses: (1) transient wheezing, (2) persistent wheezing, and (3) late-onset wheezing. 99 Transient wheezing in early infancy has been well characterized, with decreased airflow rates on pulmonary function testing at birth, onset of wheezing within the first year, and resolution by mid-childhood with no lasting effects on pulmonary function. 98 Transient wheezing is the most prevalent form of early wheezing and accounts for 60% of the children who wheeze in infancy. It has no significant relationship to atopy but maternal smoking during pregnancy has been identified as a variable significantly associated with this phenotype. 100 It is suspected that these children have smaller airways, which seems to be associated with maternal smoking, and as they grow the episodic narrowing of the already small airway by viral-induced inflammation becomes asymptomatic. 98 Children with persistent wheezing can be subdivided into nonatopic and atopic. Nonatopic persistent wheezing comprises 20% of wheezy children under the age of three years and is associated with the first episode of wheezing occurring less than 1 year of age. 98 It is believed that this phenotype may be caused by an alteration in the regulation of airway tone leading to viral-induced wheeze. 101 The atopic persistent wheezing phenotype is found in 20% of children who wheeze during the first 3 years of life and symptoms typically present after age 1 year. Risk factors associated with atopic wheeze include male gender, parental asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilia at 9 months, and a history of wheezing with lower respiratory tract infections. 101 This phenotype is also associated with early sensitization to food or inhalant allergens 102 and reduced lung function at age 6 years (compared with children with no history of wheezing with lower respiratory illnesses). 98 Late-onset wheezing (wheezing absent before age 3 years, but present at age 6 years) seems to represent another phenotype. These children are more likely to be male, have mothers with asthma, be sensitized to allergens, and have early rhinitis than children who never wheezed.
