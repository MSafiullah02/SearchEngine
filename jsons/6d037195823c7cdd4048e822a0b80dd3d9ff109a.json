            "text": "44 Ageing results in a decline in immune function. We showed previously that healthy older 45 humans (>65 years old) have reduced antigen-specific cutaneous immunity to varicella 46 zoster virus (VZV) antigen challenge. This was associated with p38 MAP kinase driven 47 inflammation that was induced by mild tissue injury caused by the injection of the antigen 48 itself. Here we show that non-specific injury induced by injection of air or saline into the skin 49 of older adults recruits CCR2 + CD14 + monocytes by CCL2 produced by senescent 50 fibroblasts. These monocytes reduced TRM proliferation via secretion of prostaglandin E2 51 (PGE2). Pre-treatment with a p38-MAPK inhibitor (Losmapimod) in older adults in vivo 52 significantly decreased CCL2 expression, recruitment of monocyte into the skin, COX2 53 expression and PGE2 production. This enhanced the VZV response in the skin. Therefore, 54 local inflammation arising from interaction between senescent cells and monocytes leads to 55 immune decline in the skin during ageing, a process that can be reversed. 56 ES Chambers et al 4 | P a g e Introduction: 57 Immunity decreases during ageing as evidenced by the increase in susceptibility to 58 infections such as pneumonia and influenza, re-activation of latent infections such as 59 varicella zoster virus (VZV; herpes zoster or shingles), decreased vaccine efficacy and 60 increased incidence of cancer (Ciabattini et al., 2018; Diffey and Langtry, 2005; Gavazzi and 61 Krause, 2002). A key challenge is to identify mechanisms that can be manipulated to boost 62 immunity and reduce morbidity and mortality in older individuals. Low grade systemic 63 inflammation, termed inflammageing is characterised by high serum levels of the 64 inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and C reactive protein (CRP) (Franceschi et al., 65 2017). Elevated levels of inflammatory proteins are a strong predictor for frailty and mortality 66 (Dinh et al., 2019; Furman et al., 2017). However, it is not clear how inflammageing inhibits 67 antigen-specific immunity during ageing. Mechanisms that contribute to inflammageing may 68 include increased gut permeability and subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a TLR4 ligand) 69 leakage (Kim et al., 2016; Thevaranjan et al., 2017), increased presence of damage-70 associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) and increased visceral fat that can 71 activate mononuclear phagocytes (Franceschi et al., 2017). In addition, senescent non-72 lymphoid cells in tissues (such as fibroblasts) can also secrete many inflammatory proteins 73 as part of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (Campisi, 2013; Freund 74 et al., 2010; Hall et al., 2016). 75 We previously identified reduced antigen-specific cutaneous recall responses in healthy old 76 compared to young donors in vivo (Agius et al., 2009; Akbar et al., 2013; Vukmanovic-Stejic 77 et al., 2008; Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). This difference was not due to decreased 78 numbers or the responsiveness of antigen-specific circulating or skin resident-memory T 79 cells (TRM) (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2015)",

One such 81 change was the propensity to exhibit amplified inflammation in response to mild tissue injury 82 in the skin after saline-injection, that was not observed in young subjects (Vukmanovic-Stejic 83 et al., 2018). There was a direct association between the propensity to exhibit inflammation 84 in older subjects and the decreased response to VZV antigen challenge in the skin since 85 short-term systemic treatment with an oral anti-inflammatory drug (Losmapimod; p38 86 mitogen-activated protein kinase [p38 MAPK] inhibitor) significantly increased the cutaneous 87 VZV response (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). A crucial unanswered question was the 88 mechanism by which inflammation inhibited immunity in vivo. 89",

In 96 addition, Losmapimod treatment significantly reduced COX2 expression and PGE2 97 production confirming that p38 MAPK signalling is upstream of COX2 (Dean et al., 1999; 98 Guan et al., 1998).

To assess whether the CD14 + monocyte infiltration was a characteristic of 321 all aged individuals or only those with reduced VZV-specific immunity, we investigated the 322 infiltration of these cells after saline in old VZV responders (red circles) and low responders 323 (filled circles). Old responders to VZV exhibited a similar low extent of CD14 + monocyte 324 infiltration to younger adults (black squares). However, the majority of older donors with a 325 low clinical score (filled circles) had elevated infiltration of these cells. When all the data was 326 combined there was a significant negative correlation between the fold change in CD14 + 327 monocytes in response to saline challenge and the VZV clinical score (R=-0.38 and p=0.04; 328 Figure 1E ).

Immunofluorescence staining was performed on normal skin to determine 408 expression of EP4 on CD4 + TRM (as identified by co-expressing CD69; Figure 4A ). The 409 majority of CD4 + TRM expressed EP4 (81.2%), indicating that they have the capacity to 410 respond to PGE2 produced by monocytes. We next assessed the co-localisation of CD14 + 411 monocytes and CD4 + TRM cells in normal and saline injected skin from old subjects. In normal 412 skin, CD14 + monocytes were on average 15.86\u03bcm away from CD4 + TRM, however after 413 saline injection the monocytes were significantly closer to the CD4 + TRM (9.47\u03bcm; Figure 4B  414 and C). This increased proximity was likely due to increase in the number of monocytes in 415 the skin after saline injection. To confirm that monocytes have the ability to suppress skin 416 CD4 + TRM proliferation, CD4 + TRM were isolated from the skin using suction blister technology 417 as described previously ( Figure 4D ) (Akbar et al., 2013) . Skin CD4 + TRM cells were pre-418 labelled with CellTrace Violet and stimulated with CD3 and IL-2 in the presence of either 419 stimulated or unstimulated monocytes for four days. We observed a significant reduction in 420 CD4 + TRM cell proliferation in the presence of stimulated when compared to unstimulated 421 monocytes ( Figure 4E Figure 4B) . Furthermore, after Losmapimod there was a 445 significant reduction in the number of CCL2 + cells and the number of CCL2 + senescent 446 fibroblasts as defined as being p16 + FSP-1 + (Figures 5D, 5E) . We confirmed experimentally 447 that the treatment of senescent dermal fibroblasts with Losmapimod in vitro significantly 448 reduced their CCL2 production, suggesting Losmapimod could have a direct effect on 449 senescent fibroblast in vivo (Supplementary Figure 4C) . As a result of the reduced CCL2 450 there was significantly reduced monocyte infiltration in saline injected skin Post-Losmapimod 451 ( Figure 5F ).

The recruited monocytes inhibit TRM proliferation via upregulation of COX2 and subsequent production of the lipid mediator Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The treatment of older adults with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, Losmapimod, results in reduced CCL2 production from the senescent fibroblasts and reduced monocyte infiltration. In addition, p38 MAPK is upstream of COX2 signalling, therefore the treatment with Losmapimod also inhibits COX2 upregulation and reduced PGE2 production. This significantly increases the T cell response to VZV in the skin of older subjects",

We and others have shown that there are increased 354 numbers of senescent fibroblasts in the skin of older humans (Dimri et al., 1995; Pereira et 355 al., 2019; Ressler et al., 2006) and CCL2 is a known component of the senescence 356 associated secretory phenotype (SASP)(Campisi, 2013). Indeed, using p16 as a marker of 357 senescence we found that FSP1 + p16 + fibroblasts were the main source of CCL2 after saline 358 injection of old donors (Figure 2Gand H). Senescent fibroblasts made up 61.8% of 359 CCL2 + FSP1 + cells in normal skin which increased to 70.7% in saline-injected skin (data not 360 shown). Although some non-senescent fibroblast evidently expressed CCL2, our previous 361 data showed that senescent fibroblasts produce significantly more CCL2 than the non-362 senescent fibroblasts (Pereira et al., 2019). Therefore, the early production of SASP-related 363 mediators by senescent fibroblasts after saline injection (including CCL2) may lead to the 364 recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the site of skin challenge. This interaction between 365 senescent cells and monocyte recruitment is supported indirectly by the significant 366 correlation between the number of senescent fibroblasts present in the skin and the extent of 367 CD14 + monocyte infiltration after saline injection (Fig. 2I). 368 369 Monocytes inhibit TRM proliferation through production of Prostaglandin E2. 370 We next investigated the mechanisms by which the recruitment of monocytes reduced 371 antigen-specific immunity in old subjects. We first assessed the expression of inhibitory 372 pathways in normal and saline injected skin pre-and post-Losmapimod by RNAseq. We 373 found that saline injection (in old individuals) resulted in increased expression of a number of 374 immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) receptors such as LILRB3 (ILT5), LILRB2 (ILT4), 375 LILRA2 (ILT1), LILRB4 (ILT3) and LILRB1 (ILT2), inhibitory ligands such as CD274 376 (programme-death ligand 1; PDL-1) and PDCD1LG2 (PDL-2), ligand for the T cell receptor 377 TIGIT and PVR, as well as inducible COX2 enzyme PTGS2 (Figure 3A). 378 PTGS2 (encoding COX2) was one of the most highly upregulated genes in saline-injected 379 skin of the old subjects (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018) and elevated COX2 expression 380following saline injection was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistology (Figure 3B",

LPS treatment significantly increased COX2 387 expression in monocytes compared to untreated controls (Supplementary Figure 3) (Dean et 388 al., 1999; Mestre et al., 2001). Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated monocytes were co-389 cultured with autologous peripheral CD4 + T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and IL-2 and 390 proliferation was assessed at after four days. Stimulated monocytes inhibited CD4 + T cell 391 proliferation as compared to control (unstimulated) monocytes (Figure 3E-F). However, 392 production of the cytokines IFNy, IL-2 and IL-10 was not affected at day 4 post-culture (data 393 not shown). To determine if COX2 expression was involved in the inhibition of CD4 + T cell 394 proliferation, a COX2-specific inhibitor NS-398 was added to the co-cultures. Treatment with 395 NS-398 led to a significant increase in the proliferation of the CD4 + T cells (Figure 3G). 396 COX2 is involved in the production of a range of lipid mediators, the most common being 397 PGE2 (Kalinski, 2012). To establish if PGE2 was involved in the inhibition of CD4 + T cell 398 proliferation, we blocked the receptor for PGE2, EP4, on CD4 + T cells using the inhibitor MF-399 498. The blockade of PGE2 signalling significantly increased the proliferation of the CD4 + T 400 cells in the presence of inflammatory monocytes (Figure 3H). To confirm that PGE2 did not 401 alter the monocyte phenotype we cultured monocytes with PGE2 and assessed their 402 inhibitory receptor (CD112, CD155, Galectin 9, ILT3 and PDL-1, PDL-2) expression and 403 cytokine production. We did not observe any significant effects on the expression of these 404 receptor expression in monocytes (data not shown), confirming the effect of PGE2 was on 405 the CD4 + T cells directly.

To investigate if p38-MAPK inhibition altered CCL2 429 production and inflammatory monocyte recruitment in the skin, RNAseq analysis was 430 performed on biopsies collected from normal skin and from skin 6 hours after saline injection 431 with saline both before and after Losmapimod treatment (study design Figure 5A). We 432 stratified our subjects in the RNAseq analysis according to the extent of clinical score 433 improvement. The individuals that had no improvement in clinical score are represented as 434 white and those who had the biggest improvement in clinical score after Losmapimod 435 treatment represented by dark green (Figure 5B). A list of all differentially expressed genes 436 can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Saline injection resulted in a large pro-inflammatory 437 response with a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory genes such as CCL2, 438 CCL8, FOSL1, IL1B and TREM1 at 6 hours pre-Losmapimod treatment (Figure 5C). This 439 response to saline was reduced after Losmapimod pre-treatment (Figure 5C) and the top six 440 upregulated genes that were significantly different between normal and saline injected skin 441 were no longer significantly different post-Losmapimod treatment (Supplementary Figure 442 4A).

We found that Losmapimod pre-treatment was 484 associated with a significant increase in CD4 + (Figure 7C,7D) and CD8 + (Figure 7F, 7G) T 485 cell infiltration into the skin 7 days after VZV injection. The increased number of CD4 + and 486 CD8 + T cells in perivascular infiltrates was associated with an increased proliferation of 487 these cells in situ indicated by Ki67 expression (Figures 7E and H) (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2015). Taken together our data show that short-term blockade of inflammation using the p38 489 MAP kinase inhibitor Losmapimod can significantly enhance the cutaneous immune 490 response to antigen challenge in older adults.Discussion:Furthermore, older adults who had the greatest tendency to mount inflammatory responses 494 after mild tissue injury induced by saline injection had the lowest response to recall response495 to VZV antigen challenge in the skin (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). This suggested that 496 increased propensity to exhibit inflammatory responses leads to inhibition of VZV-specific T 497 cell responses in the skin. The fact that the temporary blockade of inflammation in these old 498 individuals with a p38-MAPK inhibitor in vivo enhanced the response to VZV antigen 499 challenge in the skin supports this contention (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). However, the 500 source of inflammation in the skin of older subjects or the mechanism by which the 501 inflammation inhibited TRM cell function was not known. 502 We now show that senescent fibroblasts in the skin of old subjects secrete an array of 503 chemokines including CCL2 in response to tissue injury, such as those induced by injecting 504 saline, VZV or air. This leads to recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into the skin that 505 inhibit skin TRM activation in part by secreting lipid mediators such as PGE2 via a COX2-506 dependant pathway. However, short-term systemic p38-MAPK blockade induced by treating 507 old donors with Losmapimod, leads to significantly reduced CCL2 (and other chemokine) 508 production by senescent fibroblasts, reduced monocyte infiltration and reduced COX2 and 509 PGE2 expression in response to injection of saline or VZV antigens. This results in 510 significant improvement of VZV-specific cutaneous T cell responses (Figure 8). Therefore, 511 p38-MAPK inhibition can act by significantly reducing the recruitment of inflammatory 512 monocytes into the skin and also by inhibiting the function of those that still manage to 513 extravagate into the tissue. 514 Ageing leads to the accumulation of senescent cells that is observed in many tissues 515 including the skin (Pereira et al., 2019; Ressler et al., 2006); therefore, the recruitment of 516 inflammatory monocytes in response to signals from senescent fibroblasts may contribute to 517 age-related decreased immunity in other organs as well as the skin. CCL2 is involved in the 518 recruitment of monocytes into the skin and it is a component of the SASP (Pereira et al., 519 2019). The significant correlation between the number of senescent fibroblasts that were 520 present in the skin before injection and the extent of CD14 + monocyte infiltration indirectly 521 supports the interaction between these cells. Although the abundance of senescent cells 522 increases in the skin during ageing (Dimri et al., 1995; Pereira et al., 2019; Ressler et al., 523 2006) there is no overt expression of inflammatory mediators in un-manipulated skin of old 524 subjects (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2015). This suggests that at the steady state, the 525 propensity to mount inflammatory responses including the SASP is inhibited in this tissue. In 526 support of this idea there are increased numbers of Foxp3 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) and 527 increased expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 by cutaneous TRM cells, which may 528 contribute to the control of inflammation in this tissue I older individuals (Vukmanovic-Stejic 529 et al., 2008; Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2015). One possibility is that Tregs may inhibit the 530 secretion of inflammatory mediators by senescent tissue stromal cells and this requires 531 further investigation. The breakdown of homeostasis induced by tissue injury, may override 532 pre-existing inhibitory processes and allow the secretion of SASP-related factors leading to 533 the subsequent events that we have described 534 We found that skin infiltrating monocytes secrete PGE2 via a COX2 dependent pathway. 535 PGE2 has disparate roles in immune responses as it has been shown to be pro-536 inflammatory (causing oedema formation and pain) as well as contributing to resolution of 537 inflammation (Kalinski, 2012). Here we show that PGE2 produced by COX2 expressing 538 inflammatory monocytes inhibits T cell proliferation in vitro and may directly inhibit antigen-539 specific TRM activation in the skin. PGE2 has been shown previously to directly inhibit CD4 + T 540 cell proliferation in humans (Okano et al., 2006). Furthermore, this inhibition may occur via 541 increased expression of COX2 and production of PGE2 by monocytes (Chen et al., 2011). 542 During chronic viral infection PGE2 can also directly suppress CD8 + T cells delaying viral 543 clearance (Chen et al., 2013). We now show that PGE2 can directly suppress the activation 544 and proliferation of human skin derived TRM cells. PGE2 may also induce the expansion and 545 increase the function of Foxp3 + Tregs (Baratelli et al., 2005; Sharma et al., 2005) explaining 546 why these cells increases in the skin during ageing (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2008; 547 Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2013). 548 Elevated PGE2 concentrations are also found at the sites of chronic viral infection and virus-549 specific T cells in the liver of Hepatitis B infected individuals express the PGE2 receptor EP4 550 (Chen et al., 2015; Okano et al., 2006). The observation that PGE2 is found in tumour sites 551 prompted the suggestion that COX2 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of colon cancer 552 and basal and squamous cell carcinoma (Pandeya et al., 2019; Steinbach et al., 2000). In 553 addition, PGE2 may promote immunosuppression by inducing the anti-inflammatory cytokine 554 IL-10 by mononuclear phagocytes (MacKenzie et al., 2013; Nakanishi and Rosenberg, 555 2013). We now show that the PGE2 receptor, EP4, is expressed by the majority of skin-556 resident TRM that facilitates the inhibition of these cells by this mediator. 557 Monocytes were historically regarded as precursors of macrophages, however more recent 558 data shows that they can be effector cells in their own right (Cros et al., 2010; Goritzka et al., 559 2015). We confirmed previous studies showing that monocytes can inhibit antigen-specific 560 responses (Sammicheli et al., 2016; Watanabe et al., 2017). Monocytes were shown to be 561 increased in the leukocyte infiltrates in the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 562",

Although CCR2 + monocytes can contribute to the 572 inflammatory environment in the skin, they are also actively involved in the resolution of 573 inflammation, for example in in the gut (Farro et al., 2017). Therefore, microenvironmental 574 cues may determine the function of monocytes that are recruited into different tissues. 575 Excessive inflammation has been shown to inhibit antigen-specific immunity (Pence et al., 576 2012) and reduce vaccination efficacy (Fourati et al., 2016; Muyanja et al., 2014; Parmigiani 577 et al., 2013). We have shown that the effects of inflammation on inhibiting immunity can be 578 reversed with a p38-MAPK inhibitor. Studies with other inhibitors of inflammation such as 579 mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin have shown that they can enhance the response to influenza 580 vaccination in older subjects by 20% (Mannick et al., 2014). Additionally, in non-human 581 ageing models, metformin and rapamycin can increase life-span and immune function 582 (Cabreiro et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2011; Neff et al., 2013). In addition, in a murine model of 583 breast cancer COX2 inhibitor could improve DC-based vaccine efficacy by increasing IFN\u03b3 584 production and cytotoxic CD8 function (Basu et al., 2006). Therefore, many anti-585 inflammatory drugs are already licenced for use in humans or have been through phase III 586 clinical trials. Our observations with the p38-MAPK inhibitor Losmapimod provide a proof-of-587 principle demonstration that the efficacy of these drugs could be tested for their ability to 588 prevent the deleterious effects of inflammageing resulting in the enhancement of antigen-589 specific immunity in older humans in vivo. 590 RNA-seq samples.

ANA was involved in the overall design of 605 the study, initiated and coordinated the collaborative interaction between the different 606 research groups, interpreted the data, contributed writing and edited the manuscript. 607 We thank Dr. Iain Laws, Dr. Ruchira Glaser, Dr Lea Sarov-Blat and Dr. Robert Henderson at 608 GSK, Dr Veronique Birault at the Francis Crick Institute and Professor Mahdad Noursadeghi 609 at University College London for support in developing this project. We are also grateful to 610 Glaxo-Smith Kline for providing the drug Losmapimod (MICA agreement with the MRC) and 611 to the Losmapimod team at GSK for organizing the dispatch of the clinical supply of the drug 612 in this Investigator Led study. We would especially like to thank the blood and skin donors 613 who volunteered for this study and to our research nurses Ms Megan Harries-Nee and Ms. 614 Michelle Berkley for their outstanding work 615 616Competing interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests related Recruitment of monocytes to sites of injection in the skin A, Schematic of visits for blood and skin sampling by old (>65 years) and young (<40 years) donors taking part in this study. B, representative image of a skin section stained with DAPI (white), CCR2 (red) and CD14 (blue), pink arrows indicate CD14 and CCR2 co-staining and blue arrow indicates CD14 single stain. Cumulative delta change in number of CD14+ or CCR2 + CD14 + cells in C, salineinjected (10 young and 14 old). D, cumulative data showing the frequency of monocytes in normal (N) and Saline (6 hours; S6) in skin biopsies collected from young (white) and old (grey) individuals as assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were identified as mononuclear phagocytes if they were CD45 + Lineage positive but negative for CD3, CD19, CD20 CD56 and HLA-DR + . The CD14 + and CD14 + CCR2 + cells were assessed as a percentage of CD45+ cells present in the skin. E, Cumulative delta change in number of CD14 + or CCR2 + CD14 + cells in VZV-injected skin a (5 Young and 5 old) as compared to normal skin. F, Correlation between delta change in number of CD14 + cells in the skin after saline injection as compared to normal skin in relation to their VZV clinical response. Old donors are in black filled circles (VZV score 0-3), Old responders in open red circles (VZV clinical score \u22654) and young donors are in open black square.
