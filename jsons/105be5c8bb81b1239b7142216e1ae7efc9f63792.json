The role of nanomaterials is rapidly increasing in many aspects of everyday life. This is promoting a wide range of research needs related to both the design of new materials with required properties and performing a comprehensive risk assessment of the manufactured nanoparticles. The development of nanoscience also opens new areas for QSAR modelers. We have begun this contribution with a detailed discussion on the remarkable physical-chemical properties of nanomaterials and their specific toxicities. Both these factors should be considered as potential endpoints for further nano-QSAR studies. Then, we have highlighted the status and research needs in the area of molecular descriptors applicable to nanomaterials. Finally, we have put together currently available nano-QSAR models related to the physico-chemical endpoints of nanoparticles and their activity. Although we have observed many problems (i.e., a lack of experimental data, insufficient and inadequate descriptors), we do believe that application of QSAR methodology will significantly support nanoscience in the near future. Development of reliable nano-QSARs can be considered as the next challenging task for the QSAR community.",

In the nanometer-scale, finite size effects such as surface area and size distribution can cause nanoparticles to have significantly different properties as compared to the bulk material [16] . For instance, by decreasing the size of gold samples one induces color changes from bright yellow through reddish-purple up to blue. However, from the physico-chemical viewpoint, the novel properties of nanoparticles can also be determined by their chemical composition, surface structure, solubility, shape, ratio of particles in relation to agglomerates, and surface area to volume ratio. All these factors may give rise to unique electronic, magnetic, optical, and structural properties and, therefore, lead to opportunities for using nanomaterials in novel applications and devices [16] .",

For example, the strength of nanocrystalline nickel is five orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding microcrystalline nickel [18] . Interestingly, the observed strength of crystalline nanomaterials is accompanied by a loss of ductility, which can result in a limitation of their utility [19] . However, some of the nanocrystalline materials have the ability to undergo considerable elongation and plastic deformation without failing (even up to 100-300%). Such machinability and superplasticity properties have been observed for ceramics (including monoliths and composites), metals (including aluminum, magnesium, iron, titanium), intermetallic elements (including iron, nickel, and titanium base), and laminates [20] . Although the atomic weight of carbon nanotubes is about one-sixth of the weight of steel, their Young's modulus and tensile strength are, respectively, five and 100 times higher than those of steel [21] . In addition, nanoparticles, because of their very small sizes and surface/interface effects such as the fundamental change in coordination, symmetry, and confinement, they may exhibit high magnetic susceptibility. A variety of nanoparticles reveal anomalous magnetic properties such as superparamagnetism. This opens new areas of potential application for them, such as data storage and ferrofluid technology [22] .",

For instance, the high biocompatibility of magnetite nanocrystals (Fe 3 O 4 ) makes them potentially useful as the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents [23] . One of the unique aspects of nanoparticles is their high wettability, termed by Fujishima [24] as superhydrophilicity. Depending upon the chemical composition, the surface can exhibit superhydrophilic characteristics. For example, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), at sizes below a few nm, can decrease the water contact angle to 0\u00b11 \u2022 [24] . Nano-sized composites, due to the chemical composition and viscosity of the intercrystalline phase, may provide a significant increase in creep resistance. It has been demonstrated that alumina/silicon carbide composites are characterized by a minimum creep rate, three times lower than the corresponding monolith [25] .",

Conversely, it is well established that nano-sized particles, due to their unique physical and chemical properties discussed above, behave differently from their larger counterparts of the same chemical composition [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Because of the difference between nanoparticles and bulk chemicals, the risk characterization of bulk materials cannot be directly extrapolated to nanomaterials. The biological activity of nanoparticles and their unique properties causing harmful effects are highly dependent on their size. Nanoparticles, because of their small size, may pass organ barriers such as skin, olfactory mucosa, and the blood-brain barrier [32] [33] [34] , readily travel within the circulatory system of a host, and deposit in target organs. This is not possible with the same material in a larger form [35] . Indeed, reduction of the particle's size to the nanoscale level results in a steady increase of the surface to volume ratio. As a consequence, a larger number of potentially active groups per mass unit is \"available\" on the surface and might interact with biological systems [35] . This is one possible explanation why nano-sized particles of a given compound are generally more toxic than the same compound in its larger form [36] .",

However, when a large dose of strongly electrophilic nanoparticles enter the body, the balance between reduced glutathione (GSH) and its oxidized form (GSSG) is destroyed [47] and the unscavenged oxidants cause cell injuries by attacking DNA, proteins, and membranes [48] .

In general, the descriptors can be classified according to their dimensionality. Constitutional descriptors, socalled \"zero-dimensional,\" are derived directly from the formula (e.g., the number of oxygen atoms). Descriptors of bulk properties, such as n-octanol/water partition coefficient or water solubility, are classified as \"one-dimensional\" descriptors. Topological descriptors based on the molecular graph theory are called \"twodimensional\" descriptors and characterize connections between individual atoms in the molecule. \"Three-dimensional\" descriptors reflect properties derived from the three-dimensional structure of a molecule optimized at the appropriate level of quantum-mechanical theory. \"Four-dimensional\" descriptors are defined by molecular properties arising from interactions of the molecule with probes characterizing the surrounding space or by stereodynamic representation of a molecule, including flexibility of bonds, conformational behavior, etc. [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Only a little is known about applicability of those \"traditional\" descriptors for the characterization of nanostructures. Some authors [80] [81] [82] postulate that the existing descriptors are insufficient to express the specific physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles. Thus, novel and more appropriate types of the descriptors must be developed. A group of nanoparticles is structurally diversified. In fact, this group has been defined arbitrarily in some way, taking into account size as the only criterion of the particles' membership. Therefore, structures as various as nanotubes, fullerenes, crystals, and atom clusters as well as chemical species of such different properties as metals, non-metals, organic compounds, inorganic compounds, conductors, semi-conductors, and isolators were put together into one single group. Since nanoparticles are not structurally homogenous, a common mechanism of toxicity cannot be expected for all of them. In consequence, toxicity and other properties should be studied within the most appropriately chosen sub-classes of structural and physico-chemical similarity.",

For instance, a nanoparticle of ceramic zirconium oxide, existing in bulk form and synthesized at a temperature of 800 \u2022 C can be expressed by the code \"Zr,O,O,CER,%E\" [80] . Similar to the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), the international chemical identifier (InChI) might also be used directly as a descriptor of chemical composition [89] . Another possibility is to apply descriptors derived from either molecular graph (MG) or the graphs of atomic orbitals (GAO) theory [90] [91] [92] . In the first case, vertexes in the graph represent atoms, while edges represent covalent bonds. In the second method, vertexes refer to particular atomic orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p, etc.), while edges connect the orbitals belonging to different atoms (Figure 14-1) . Based on the molecular graphs, Faulon and coworkers [93] [94] [95] [96] have developed the signature molecular descriptor approach for the characterization of fullerenes and nanotubes.

However, in many cases these two-dimensional characteristics are insufficient to investigate more complex phenomena. In such a situation, a more sophisticated approach must be employed to describe the structure appropriately. As mentioned previously, quantum-mechanical calculations can deliver useful information on the three-dimensional features (see Chapter 2). Among others, they include: molecular geometry (bond lengths, valence, and torsion angles), electron distribution, ionization potential, electron affinity, surface reactivity, and band gap. When performing quantum-mechanical calculations, there are always two important assumptions to be introduced. First one is an appropriate molecular model; the second one is the appropriate level of the theory. Both assumptions are closely related: when the model (system) is too large, the calculations at the highest levels of the theory are impossible, because of large computational time and other technical resources to be required [97] .",

In general, there are two strategies for modeling of crystalline solids: (i) an application of the periodic boundary conditions (PBSs) and (ii) calculations based on the molecular clusters. In the first approach, calculations for a single unit cell are expanded in the three dimensions with respect to the translational symmetry by employing appropriate boundary conditions (i.e., the unit cell should be neutral and should have no dipole moment). In doing so, the model includes information on the long-range forces occurring in the crystal.

            "text": "As previously mentioned, in addition to calculated properties, experimentally derived properties may also serve as descriptors for developing nano-QSARs (Table 14-1). The experimental descriptors seem to be especially useful for expressing size distribution, agglomeration state, shape, porosity, and irregularity of the surface area. Interestingly, the experimental results can be combined with numerical methods to define new descriptors. For example, images taken by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or atomic force (Figure 14 -2) might be processed with use of novel chemometric techniques of image analysis. Namely, a series of images for different particles of a given nanostructure should first be taken. Then, the pictures must be numerically averaged and converted into a matrix containing numerical values that correspond to intensity of each pixel in the gray scale or color value in the RGB scale. New descriptors can be defined based on the matrix (i.e., a shape descriptor can be calculated as a sum of non-zero elements in the matrix; porosity -as a sum of relative differences between each pixel and its \"neighbors,\" etc.) [104] . Without doubt, an appropriate characterization of the nanoparticles' structure is currently one of the most challenging tasks in nano-QSAR. Although more than 5000 QSAR descriptors have been defined so far, they may be inadequate to express the supramolecular phenomena governing the unusual activity and properties of nanomaterials. As a result, much more effort in this area is required.",

The B3LYP functional and the standard 6-31G(d) Polple's style basis set were applied by Shukla and Leszczynski [106] to investigate the relationships between the shape, size, and electronic properties of small carbon fullerenes, nanodisks, nanocapsules, and nanobowls. They found out that the ionization potentials decrease, while the electron affinities increase in going from the C 60 fullerenes to the closed nanodisks, capsules, and open bowl-shaped nanocarbon clusters. In similar studies performed for capped and uncapped carbon nanotubes at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory by Yumura et al. [107, 108] , the authors demonstrated that the tube lengths, edge structures, and end caps play an important role in determining the band gap expressed as a difference between the energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) and vibrational frequencies. Wang and Mezey [109] characterized electronic structures of open-ended and capped carbon nanoneedles (CNNs) at the same theory level (B3LYP/6-311G(d)) concluding that conductivity of the studied species is strictly correlated to their size. Only very long CNNs structures have band gaps sufficiently narrow to be semiconductors, while the band gaps of very short and thin structures are too large to conduct electrons. Similarly, Poater et al. [110, 111] observed that the Parr electrophilicity and electronic movement described by the chemical potential increase with increasing length of the carbon nanoneedles and very \"short\" structures (containing four layers and less) have a HOMO-LUMO gap too large to allow conductivity. Moreover, Simeon et al. [112] , by performing B3LYP calculations, demonstrated that a replacement of the fullerene carbon atom with a heteroatom results in a significant change of electronic and catalytic properties of the fullerene molecule.",

            "text": "Regarding the five OECD principles for the validation of a (Q)SAR as discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, an ideal QSAR model, applicable for regulatory purpose, should be associated with (i) a well-defined endpoint; (ii) an unambiguous algorithm; (iii) a defined domain of applicability; (iv) appropriate measures of goodness-offit, robustness, and predictivity; and (v) a mechanistic interpretation, if possible. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to fulfill all of these principles for (Q)SARs applicable to nanomaterials. There are two main difficulties related to the development of nano-QSARs. The first one is lack of sufficiently numerous and systematic experimental data, while the second one is very limited knowledge on mechanisms of toxic action. As we mentioned many times, regarding their structure, the class of nanomaterials is not homogenous, combining a range of physico-chemical properties, as well as possible mechanisms of metabolism and toxicity. Thus, it is impossible to assume one common applicability domain for all nanomaterials. Each mode of toxicity and each class of nanomaterials should be studied separately. Analyzing the literature data (Section 14.3) it must be concluded that even if a class of structurally similar nanoparticles is tested with the same laboratory protocol, the number of tested compounds is often insufficient to perform comprehensive internal and external validation of a model and to calculate the appropriate measures of robustness and predictivity in QSAR. For instance, Limbach et al. [116] have proposed two rankings of cytotoxicity of seven oxide nanoparticles based on the in vitro study of human and rodent cells. The rankings were as follows: (i) Fe 2 O 3 \u2248asbestos > ZnO > CeO 2 \u2248ZrO 2 \u2248TiO 2 \u2248Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and (ii) ZnO > asbestos\u2248ZrO 2 > Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 \u2248Fe 2 O 3 \u2248CeO 2 \u2248TiO 2 , respectively, for human (mesothelinoma) and rodent cells. In another paper by the same research group, the authors have found that for four metal nanoparticles -namely, TiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , Mn 3 O 4 , and Co 3 O 4 -the chemical composition was the main factor determining the formation of reactive oxygen responsible for toxicity toward human lung epithelial cells [117] . Obviously, the results cannot be combined together and a data set containing five or six compounds is too small to build an appropriately validated QSAR model. Do these restrictions and problems mean QSAR modelers are not able to provide useful and reliable information for nanoparticles? We do not believe this to be true. The amount of data will increase along with increasing number of nanotoxicological studies. However, no one can expect the accumulation in the next few years of such extensive data for nanomaterials, as it is now available for some environmental pollutants, pharmaceuticals, and \"classical\" industrial chemicals [118, 119] . Despite the limitations, there are some very promising results of preliminary nano-QSAR studies which are reviewed below.",

The authors applied CODESSA descriptors, namely, RNCG -relative negative charge (Zefirov's PC); 2 ASIC -average structural information content of the second order; E min ee (CC) -minimum exchange energy for a C-C bond; 1 IC -first-order information content; and RPCS -relative positive charged surface area. Interestingly, the models were calibrated on 15 compounds including 14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing between two and six aromatic rings and the fullerene. Although values of solubility predicted for the fullerene seem to be reasonable, the authors did not validate the applicability domain of the models. Indeed, the structural difference between 14 hydrocarbons and the fullerene is probably too large to make reliable predictions for C 60 (the polycyclic hydrocarbons are planar, but the fullerene is spherical). In addition, the experimental values of log S for 14 PAHs ranged from -3.80 to 0.22 in heptane and from \u22123.03 to \u22120.02 in octanol, while the experimental values for the fullerene were \u22124.09 and 4.18 in heptane and octanol, respectively.",

The example of the DCW(InChI) calculation is presented in Table 14 -2. The values of CW(I k ) were optimized by the Monte Carlo method. All of the above models refer to physico-chemical properties as the endpoints, thus they are also termed quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs). Currently, there are only a small number of QSARs related directly to nanomaterials' activity. In 2007 Tsakovska [128] proposed the application of QSAR methodology to predict protein-nanoparticle interactions. In 2008 Durdagi et al. published two papers [129, 130] presenting QSAR-based design of novel inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 aspartic protease (HIV-1 PR). In the first work [130] the authors developed a three-dimensional QSAR model with comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) method for 49 derivatives of fullerene C 60 . The values of R 2 and Q 2 for the training set (n=43) were 0.99 and 0.74, respectively. The absolute values of residuals in the validation set (n=6) ranged from 0.25 to 0.99 logarithmic units of EC 50 (\u03bcM). The second model [129] were characterized by lower values of the statistics (n=17, R 2 =0.99 and Q 2 =0.56). However, in that case the predictions for an external set of compounds (n test =3) were possible with an acceptable level of error. In addition, the authors proposed nine novel structures indicating possible inhibitor activity based on the model obtained. They concluded that steric effects play the most important role in the inhibition mechanism as well as electrostatic and H-donor/acceptor properties. However, the last two types of interactions are of lower importance. Similarly, SMILES-based optimal descriptors have been successfully applied for modeling HIV-1 PR fullerene-based inhibitors [131] . The model reported by Toropov et al. [131] was described by the following equation and parameters: The DCW descriptor in this case is defined as the following (Eq. 14-12):",

In many cases, lack of data precludes an appropriate implementation of statistical methods, including necessary external validation of the model. The problem of the paucity of data will be solved only when a strict collaboration between the experimentalists and QSAR modelers is established. The role of the modelers in such studies should not be restricted only to rationalization of the data after completing the experimental part, but also they must be involved in the planning of the experimentation. Since the experiments on nanomaterials are usually expensive, a kind of compromise between the highest possible number of compounds for testing and the lowest number of compounds necessary for developing a reliable QSAR model should be reached. Regarding the limited amount of data and high costs of the experiments, the idea of applying novel read-across techniques enabling preliminary estimation of data (Chapter 7) [82, 133] is very promising.
