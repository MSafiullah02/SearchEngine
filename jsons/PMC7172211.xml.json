            "text": "Picornaviruses are ubiquitous and commonly associated with inapparent or mild illness in humans. However, severe illness is well-recognized, particularly in young children [1]. The role of picornaviruses in acute infections in children (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, acute paralysis) is often under-recognized due to lack of appropriate specimens from early in the course of illness and to the lack of testing for certain common picornaviruses, such as parechoviruses (PeV), in most hospitals. Enterovirus (EV) and Parechovirus are genera within the family Picornaviridae that are genetically and biologically distinct but share many epidemiologic and clinical characteristics [2]. Morbidity and mortality associated with EVs and PeV may occur at all ages, but generally more severe infections occur in younger age groups [1]. Among pathogens detected in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] specimens, EV and PeV are common, particularly in young infants. Systemic disease associated with EV and PeV can result in seizures, multi-organ involvement, and death, particularly in neonates [2].",

Advances in laboratory techniques, particularly in molecular methodologies, have allowed for the rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of EV and PeV infections for clinical and public health purposes.

Urine culture for one EV-positive case-patient was positive for Escherichia coli. Acyclovir was empirically administered to 6 (46.2%) EV-positive case-patients and 3 (27.3%) PeV-positive case-patients. Among case-patients with non-traumatic LP (defined as CSF red blood cell count < 500 /\u03bcL), the median CSF white blood cell count was 2 cells/\u03bcL (range 0\u2013720) for neonates aged < 30 days (n = 10) and 5.5 cells/\u03bcL (range 1\u201395) for infants aged \u2265 30 days (n = 8) (Table 2\n). Typing was successfully performed for 11 (84.6%) of the EV-positive cases and revealed a diversity of types (Table 2). Each of the following 9 types was identified in a unique case: coxsackieviruses (CV) A6, A10, A16, and B4 and echoviruses 3, 7, 11, 17, and 25. CV-B5 was identified in 2 separate cases. In comparison, the PeV-positive cases were dominated by a single type, PeV-A3, which was identified in 10 (90.9%) cases. PeV-A4 was identified in 1 case.",

Half of the positive case-patients were initially admitted to ICU, but hospital length of stay was brief and illnesses were generally self-limiting. The picornaviruses detected in CSF represent a range of common circulating types, with most children presenting with acute febrile illness [3,4]. In previous retrospective studies using comparable populations, EV positivity ranged from 3% to 14% and PeV-positivity ranged from 5% to 17%, possibly reflecting differences in study methods and timing of enrollment relative to the seasonal and annual variations in picornavirus circulation [[13], [14], [15]]. A prospective study spanning 4 years found EV in 37% and PeV in 15%; however, EV typing was only successful on 6.5% and PeV-typing on 3.4% [16]. The availability of specimens earlier in the course of illness and the inclusion of multiple years may have contributed to the higher proportions of EV and PeV detected in comparison with this study. As noted in previous studies, EV and PeV detections were concentrated among children aged <2 months [14,16,17].",

Most clinical laboratories do not perform qualitative testing to detect PeV even though pan-PeV assays are available [6].
