The main clinical feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is represented by bilateral pneumonia with radiological signs of ground glass opacification [6]. One third of symptomatic COVID-19 patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and around 30% of these patients show signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6]. The high mortality of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is associated with intractable respiratory failure in up to 98% of all non-survivors, based on retrospective observational cohort studies from Wuhan, China [7, 8]. Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) represents a potentially life-saving modality for patients with terminal respiratory failure [9]. However, early experiences from COVID-19 \u201chot zones\u201d in China reported a high mortality rate of 50\u201382% in adult patients with ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [10, 11]. In the present case report, we describe the successful rescue treatment of a critically ill patient with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and discuss the critical variables for effective ECMO therapy in this highly vulnerable patient cohort.",

On March 6, 2020, she presented with an unstable ankle fracture to a local hospital and underwent surgery by open reduction with internal fixation the following day. Prior to her surgery, she had reported \u201cmild cold symptoms\u201d. Upon awakening from general anesthesia, during extubation she was noted to have an unusual consistency of her respiratory secretions described as \u201cpink and frothy\u201d. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated for the treatment of a presumed aspiration pneumonitis. The patient deteriorated over the subsequent days with fever, hypoxemia, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 testing was performed by nasopharyngeal swab and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was transferred to our center, an established ECMO program, for higher level of care 1 week after her initial admission.",

We illustrate the technical aspects and crucial variables related to the indication and the ultimate positive outcome of this patient. Of note, our ECMO program consists of a multi-disciplinary team of specialists in which all major clinical decisions on ECMO patients are discussed during comprehensive twice daily team rounds attended by intensivists, cardiac surgeons, perfusionists, critical care nurses, pharmacy, and respiratory therapy, as previously described [16]. Monitoring of the ECMO circuit is performed by the perfusion team with 24/7 in-house coverage [16]. The current literature established a consensus that optimal outcomes in patients with profound respiratory failure and ARDS are achieved at specialized centers with full institutional commitment to advanced respiratory therapies [17].",

            "text": "Consistent with current guidelines by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO), our institution has embraced the concept that ECMO should only be considered at programs that have established and dedicated programs [18]. Figure 3 demonstrates the decision-making algorithm for ECMO consideration, endorsed by the ELSO guidelines [17, 18]. In addition to the ELSO guidelines we utilize the RESP score developed by ELSO to determine optimal candidates for ECMO intervention. Conversely, while salvage therapies might be considered outside of an existing program, in part due to the poor outcomes associated with this approach, centers are discouraged from embarking on ECMO program development at this time for the singular purpose of providing support for COVID-19 patients [18, 19]. Another key component of the successful outcome in the patient presented in this report is the timing of the initiation of therapy. While the literature reports varying thresholds in which veno-venous ECMO should be considered for acute respiratory failure, the general indications are profound respiratory failure refractory to conventional medical and ventilator management [9, 20, 21]. This includes preceding attempts for \u201csalvage\u201d therapies with inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning ventilation, and judicious use of paralytic agents [9, 20, 21]. Patients with profound hypoxemia, hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, and worsening pulmonary compliance in the absence of mechanical causes are typically considered ECMO candidates [9, 20, 21]. Contraindications to ECMO include concerns for acute neurologic insults, such as anoxic brain injury, contraindications to anticoagulation, and baseline comorbidities that predict either futility of ECMO or limited 2-year survival [9, 20, 21]. Current indications for ECMO in COVID-19 patients were recently proposed based on the early experience with the pandemic in China [22, 23]. As the pandemic spreads and resources (such as ECMO circuits) become limited, we advocate potentially limiting ECMO to those patients who have the best predicted outcomes. While the Survival After Veno-arterial (SAVE) and RESP scores [12] are helpful in selecting patients, they do not inherently account for poor ECMO outcomes such as acute or worsening end-organ damage and advanced age. We advocate ECMO for those patients with isolated single organ (pulmonary) dysfunction, few co-morbidities, and limited acute \u2013 and potentially reversible \u2013 end-organ dysfunction. Appropriate candidates should also probably be relatively young and otherwise hemodynamically stable.\n",

While it is reasonable to consider adjuvant therapies \u2013 like inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning ventilation, the care team must define clear thresholds for when the potential success of these adjunctive therapies may be considered exhausted and ECMO therapy should be considered. In the context of COVID-19 patients whose respiratory capacity can deteriorate very quickly, the decision to initiate therapy must be anticipated in advance and before the onset of potentially irreversible end-organ dysfunction. Unequivocal thresholds for considering ECMO are particularly important in this current COVID-19 pandemic as concerns of limited resources are prompting discussions of rationing therapies to those who might benefit the most from their use [24]. It is also important to realize that ECMO might have other potential benefits beyond supporting oxygenation and ventilation needs. When configured in a veno-arterial mode, cardiac output for patients in acute systolic heart failure can be supported [20, 21]. Since COVID-19 is also associated with hyperpyrexia and cytokine storm, all of which can increased metabolic and oxygenation requirements, ECMO may also play a role in active quiescence of COVID-19 patients [18]. Preliminary United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization has been given to special \u201cECMO filters\u201d that might assist in viral clearance (www.fda.gov/media/136867/download).",

An additional benefit of ECMO is to provide improved tissue oxygenation, carbon dioxide clearance, and systemic acid-base balance resolution to avoid end-organ physiologic shock, all of which are significant causes of mortality in the COVID-19 patient [31].",
