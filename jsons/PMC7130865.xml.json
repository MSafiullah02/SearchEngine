VNs influence regulatory T cells and are important in maintaining immunological homeostasis [3]. They have significant anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic roles particularly in immune privileged sites including the eye. They are potent vasodilators and are essential for the maintenance of blood supply. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway [4] and are present in the retina of different mammalian species [5]. VNs activate AC and have a key role in converting ATP to cAMP, hence setting balance levels for ATP and cAMP. Importantly, ATP is critical for cell survival and cAMP has a central role in neurological metabolism including influencing blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, coordination of neuroregulatory pathways, and protecting against neuronal apoptosis.",

This hypothesis was suggested to account for the multi-faceted and confusing symptomatology of some fatigue-related conditions e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and fibromyalgia (FM). The constellation of symptoms associated with these conditions is consistent with compromise of receptors associated with VIP and PACAP.

This murine model of retinal degeneration is associated with autoimmune reactivity and breakdown of the blood\u2013retinal barrier [12]. This finding may be a cardinal feature of postulated VN autoimmune disorders in humans because of the critical role of cyclic AMP in maintaining endothelial integrity in blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB) settings. A sound blood supply is essential for retinal survival and its compromise will have serious consequences [13]. Retinal vasculitis is a potentially blinding condition with a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases. Noninfective retinal vasculitis is likely to be an autoimmune condition although preceding infection and cross reaction to putative autoantigens is suggested [14]. Compromise of the endothelial barriers and the BRB may instigate inflammatory responses setting up a chain of events involving VNs in a manner which provokes autoimmunity to them.",

However, contradictory findings have been reported [16]. Ocular blood flow is regulated by NO derived from the endothelium and efferent nitrergic neurons. However, induced NO expressed under influences of inflammatory mediators evokes neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis and may lead to serious ocular disease including retinal injury [17]. Other inflammatory mediators also play a role in retinal pathology [18]. Moreover, PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract [19] and PACAP attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons [20] suggesting that compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability though glutamate toxicity. Additional effects of VN compromise would possibly occur through unopposed vasoconstriction and inflammation.",

VNs not only protect against retinal pathology, but may themselves undergo autoimmune disruption to affect normally immune privileged regions of the eye. An association of VN autoimmunity with retinopathy in humans should be investigated as preventive and treatment opportunities may already exist. Clinical trials for VN replacement, PDE inhibitors and other interventions may then be considered for the treatment of autoimmune eye conditions and potentially the prevention of blindness in them.",
