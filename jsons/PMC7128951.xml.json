Among them, viral ARIs are one of the leading causes for paediatric and geriatric hospitalization and clinic visits [2], [3]. Each year, seasonal influenza causes >200 000 hospitalizations and more than $10 billion direct medical costs in the United States. In specific populations (e.g. immunocompromised patients, neonates, and chronic pulmonary disease patients), the high complication and mortality rates from viral ARIs is a major concern [4]. Moreover, empirical antibiotics are commonly prescribed to patients with viral ARIs because of the lack of rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods and nonspecific symptoms, which delay proper treatments and precipitate antibiotic resistance [4], [5], [6].",

However, these methods were either insensitive, time consuming, labor intensive or operator dependent [7], [8], [9]. New technologies have emerged as a result of massive clinical demands, such as melting curve analysis, microfluidic device and nucleic acid amplification technologies [5], [6], [10], [11], [12], [13]. These molecular diagnostic tools have shorter turnaround times and higher sensitivity for viral pathogens [14], [15]. In addition, they allow for detection of a broader panel of viruses and coinfection [15], [16], and they thus have become more widely used than the conventional virologic assays [8], [17], [18], [19]. In particular, multiplex PCR (mPCR) is a validated strategy for the rapid detection and precise identification of a large number of respiratory viruses [19], [20], [21], [22] by incorporating several primers within one reaction tube to amplify genomic fragments of many pathogens [22], [23]. With the use of a mPCR panel, one study demonstrated a 30% to 50% increase in the diagnostic yield of respiratory viruses compared to direct fluorescent antibody and culture [24].",

The Verigene RV+ test is based on gold nanoparticle technology and silver signal amplification. Lastly, Hologic Gen-Probe Prodesse launches several assays with variable run sizes that also utilize melting curve analysis but with limited multiplexing ability. Although each Prodesse assay can only detect two to three viruses at a time, the Prodesse assays are still viewed as mPCR [25]. These three mPCRs were chosen because they have shorter turnaround times and have more available studies for analysis among a number of FDA-approved mPCRs.

We included conference abstracts, posters and oral presentations only if they provided sufficient information to calculate the sensitivities and specificities of the FDA-approved mPCR systems. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: (a) they only analysed clinical specimens previously determined to be positive (without negative specimens), (b) they used our target mPCR systems as the sole standard to validate other mPCR systems and (c) they used an mPCR assay not approved by FDA as reference. In addition, we excluded reviews, guidelines, case reports, editorials, panel discussions, letters, notes and comments. For multiple publications, only the latest available publications with complete data of the same patient group were included. Studies that compared more than one FDA-approved mPCR systems with the same reference standard, used different reference methods for different viruses, used different samples for different viruses or reported prospective and retrospective samples independently have separate data sets for each comparison. Three reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts from PubMed and Embase. Disagreements or uncertainties were resolved by discussion.",

The 2 \u00d7 2 tables were further used to calculate sensitivities and specificities of the target assays. For the reference methods, virus culture and direct fluorescent antibody were grouped together because they are universally recognized as the reference standard [28], [29]. Reverse transcription (RT) PCR referred to both commercial RT-PCRs and in-house RT-PCRs. Composite reference standard was defined as a standard that used more than one comparator assays. Discrepant analyses encompassed studies that resolved discrepancies between target assay and comparator assay by bidirectional sequencing, RT-PCR, repeated testing or other methods. Studies were also grouped on the basis of whether they incorporated FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and Hologic Gen-Probe Prodesse assays as part of a composite reference standard. Studies that had <5% of the samples taken from the lower respiratory tract were categorized as using upper respiratory specimens. Children were defined as patients younger than 18 years. Studies that included both children and adult population were categorized as mixed.",

Although the rapid influenza diagnostic test can detect FluA and FluB in respiratory specimens in approximately 15 to 30 minutes, its sensitivity is limited, as reported by a previous meta-analysis [32]. This may give false-negative results, which prevents its use as a reliable excluding diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Furthermore, commonly used reference standards such as RT-PCR or virus culture may take several days to yield results and have little value for treatment decision.

Similarly, an overall LR+ for FluA of 76.9 translates into a posttest probability of 95.06%. In other words, approximately 19 of 20 patients who tested positive for FluA truly have FluA infection. In the same population with a 20% prevalence of FluA infection, a LR\u2212 of 0.0928 (FilmArray RP), 0.058 (Verigene RV+) and 0.053 (Prodesse ProFlu+) translates into a posttest probability of 2.27%, 1.43% and 1.31%, while an overall LR\u2212 for FluA of 0.06 translates into a negative predictive value of 1.48%. That is, among 200 patients who tested negative for FluA, only three with FluA infection may be missed.

Our meta-analysis synthesized data across different studies encompassing 5510 patient samples and may present a more accurate estimate of the real situation.

Our results revealed that mPCRs are highly sensitive and specific for RSV and hMPV, and they offer a more rapid and accurate alternative to traditional methods [7], [36]. The current treatment is ribavirin for high-risk infants and young children [37], with several clinical trials for novel RSV treatments underway [38], [39], [40], [41]. In contrast, for adenovirus, FilmArray RP had a moderate to low sensitivity (<70%), but its superior specificity (>0.99) makes it a reliable rule-in tool. The literature has demonstrated that commercial FilmArray RP (v1.6) has low sensitivity for adenovirus [24], [42], [43], [44], but its sensitivity greatly improved in the commercial FilmArray 1.7 [42], developed later.

Not only did we provide detailed comparison on the characteristics of the three systems but we also provided quantitative accuracy measure for the different viruses by different systems. There are several limitations to our study, however. Firstly, some included studies did not provide sufficient details regarding the version of FilmArray RP used (premarket or commercial). We traced their publication dates and contacted the FilmArray RP manufacturers as well as the authors of the original study at an attempt to confirm the version of FilmArray RP. However, sensitivity analysis showed no clinically significant difference between the sensitivities and specificities of precommercial and FDA-approved commercial assays (data not published). Secondly, some included studies have a retrospective study design; they failed to specify their inclusion criteria, and they used only previously stored samples from patients with unknown characteristics. There is also concern regarding diagnostic review bias, in which the interpretation of the result of reference test is made with knowledge of the index test result [45]. However, a test review bias is highly unlikely because the interpretation of the index tests (mPCRs) was objective. Of note, five of the included studies adopted the case\u2013control design, which tends to give an overestimation of the accuracy of the index test [45]. In addition, results of this study only showed the accuracy of three commercial mPCR systems for diagnosis of respiratory virus infection. Whether they have equal strength in therapeutic guidance remains to be validated. Lastly, our study does not provide an answer to whether mPCR systems improve the outcome of patients with respiratory virus infection compared to clinical diagnosis alone.",

The great improvement of the sensitivity of the rapid diagnosis of influenza may have the potential to change current modes of diagnosis and management. However, not all of these systems are equally useful in terms of inclusion or exclusion diagnosis. Clinicians should interpret the results on the basis of likelihood ratio and pretest probability. The next step would be to assess whether provision of information from these mPCR tests can modify clinical outcomes.",
