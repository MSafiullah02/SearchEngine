            "text": "The girl, who was diagnosed with posterior fossa desmoplastic nodular medulloblastoma, underwent tumour resection followed by unspecified chemotherapy for 9 months. One month after the last chemotherapy cycle, she developed CMV hepatitis with a viral load of 347 000 copies/mL. She started receiving ganciclovir 5\u22127.5 mg/kg twice a day as a 4-week course. Following treatment initiation, her liver function levels corrected with decreased viral load to 30 700 copies/mL. However, her ganciclovir therapy was discontinued despite detectable viral load. Ten days after treatment discontinuation, she was readmitted for colitis, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and relapsing hepatitis. Her viral load was 2 347 000 copies/mL, suggesting rebound CMV hepatitis.",

            "text": "The girl's ganciclovir therapy was restarted at 7.5 mg/kg twice a day which increased up to 10 mg/kg four times a day to attain and maintain a serum drug concentration of 0.6\u22121 mg/L. Initially, her viral load decreased, but a resurgence in viral load was reported at the end of week 5 of treatment. Gene analysis documented a mutation in the M460 codon (UL97) confirming a emergence of UL97 resistance to ganciclovir. Therefore, she was switched to foscarnet 90 mg/kg twice a day monotherapy. Despite an initial reduction in the viral load, she developed pneumonitis causing acute respiratory distress syndrome within the third week of foscarnet therapy. She was shifted to the pediatric ICU and underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Thoracic CT scan findings were consistent with interstitial pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid testing revealed CMV, parainfluenza virus type 3 and pan-picornavirus. It was considred that parainfluenza virus type 3 might have contributed to her acute respiratory distress syndrome. After 34 days of foscarnet initiation and on day 13 of ECMO, she developed nephrotoxicity. Therefore, she started receiving IV infusion of letermovir 7 mg/kg once a day as compassionate use. Her letermovir dosage were increased to a maximum of 24 mg/kg twice a day after 2.5 weeks due to a persistent high viral load of 360 000 copies/mL. After 3 weeks of letermovir treatment, a significant decrease in viral load was observed due to combined effect of foscarnet and letermovir. However, she developed massive fatal subdural haemorrhage, which was a complication of long-term ECMO support. Lung histology following autopsy revealed constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans, interstitial fibrosis and intra-alveolar haemorrhages without CMV pneumonitis. However, a PCR assays were positive for CMV and negative for parainfluenza virus type 3. It was thought that CMV infection might have contributed to her lung condition.",
