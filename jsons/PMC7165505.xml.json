            "text": "To investigate anti\u2010 and proviral host responses to HCV infection of human livers, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to examine the differential gene expression between two groups of liver samples, containing high and low HCV loads. To exclude the involvement of other variables, we divided nontumorous liver tissues into two groups, one with and one without liver cirrhosis, which were obtained from patients with chronic hepatitis in the early stages of HCC. HCV load differed markedly (>100\u2010fold) between the two groups, but the clinicopathological features were not significantly different according to the statistical analyses (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo). We identified candidate genes from livers with chronic hepatitis in the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis and verified 26 genes that were up\u2010regulated in livers with high HCV loads using chronic hepatitis livers without liver cirrhosis (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo). Of the 26 genes, seven were ISGs; OASL (2\u2032\u20105\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate synthetase\u2010like), an ISG of unknown function, inhibited HCV replication in vitro\n, as described previously.15 Thus, most genes that were up\u2010regulated in the HCV\u2010high group were related to an antiviral response. However, it is not known whether several genes are associated with anti\u2010 or proviral responses or how they function during infection. Among the genes up\u2010regulated in the HCV\u2010high group (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo), we focused on TMPRSS2, which is a member of the hepsin (HPN) subfamily of type II transmembrane serine proteases.21 TMPRSS2 was one of the top three most differentially expressed genes in addition to OASL and HLA\u2010DQA1; these genes had the lowest P value (<0.003 by Mann\u2010Whitney's U test) and showed a more than 3\u2010fold change. Because the current understanding of the physiological functions of type II transmembrane serine proteases has highlighted their contribution to human disease, it seemed important to determine whether TMPRSS2 is involved in the life cycle of HCV or its pathogenesis. Up\u2010regulation of TMPRSS2 in HCV\u2010high livers, compared with HCV\u2010low and HCV\u2010negative livers, was confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 1A). The TMPRSS2 protein was also highly expressed in the HCV\u2010high liver, as shown by immunohistochemistry (IHC); it was localized heterogeneously in liver tissue and strongly positive at the apical membrane of hepatocytes (Fig. 1B).",

Among the inhibitors to five classes of proteases, only serine protease inhibitors, including \u03b11\u2010antitrypsin, SBTI, and AEBSF, inhibited the infectivity in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 2). To confirm the role of trypsin\u2010like serine proteases on the cell surface in an early stage of HCV infection, HCVcc were inoculated in the presence of trypsin. HCV infectivity was enhanced up to 2\u2010fold by 0.2 mg/mL of trypsin (Fig. 2), which had no effect on cell morphology. To determine which step during the early stage of infection (attachment or entry of HCVcc to the cells) was inhibited by SBTI, HCVcc were incubated with cells at 4\u00b0C for the first hour for attachment, and then, after removing the HCVcc inoculum, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for a further hour to allow entry (Fig. 3A). Then, cells were incubated for 1 day to determine HCV infectivity by IF staining of HCV\u2010positive cells. Even when SBTI was present only during the second 1\u2010hour step of entry, most of the HCV infectivity was inhibited (Fig. 3Ac). HCV replication postentry was not inhibited by SBTI (Fig. 3Ae,3B). These results suggest that the trypsin\u2010like serine protease is involved at an early stage of infection, particularly during entry of HCVcc into cells. SBTI also inhibited HCV infection, to some extent, with chimeric viruses containing other genotypes 3a and 1b of structural genes, which was not statistically significant (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo).",

We determined the mRNA levels of 10 transmembrane serine proteases pre\u2010 and postinfection with JFH\u20101 HCVcc. FURIN and HPN were expressed in Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cells, but TMPRSS2 was absent (Fig. 4A). FURIN mRNA was up\u2010regulated 2\u2010fold after infection with HCVcc (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, normal human livers predominantly expressed four proteases. HPN was the most abundant, followed by FURIN, TMPRSS6, and TMPRSS2 in descending order (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo). Only TMPRSS2 was up\u2010regulated in HCV\u2010high livers (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo and Fig. 1). Cell\u2010surface serine proteases in Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cells were measured using synthetic fluorogenic substrates containing various amino acid sequences of P3\u2010P2\u2010P1 in the cleavage site (Fig. 4B). The highest protease activity was against QSR. The activities against QAR, QRR, FSR, and RVRR were of similar levels and less than half that of QSR. The substrate specificity profile of the Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cells was quite different from that of pancreatic trypsin (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of FURIN and HPN by their respective siRNAs had no effect on the focus formation of infected cells (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo).

The cell\u2010surface proteases of the TMPRSS2\u2010WT clones were specifically activated against the substrates, QAR and QGR, putative substrates of TMPRSS2, but not the proteases of the TMPRSS2\u2010mutant and \u2010negative control clones (Fig. 5C). When influenza A virus HA was introduced by transfection of the expression plasmid into the cell clones, HA induced cell\u2010to\u2010cell fusion only in the TMPRSS2\u2010WT cell clones 18 and 25 (Fig. 5D,E). The fusion depended on TMPRSS2 activity and was not induced in the TMPRSS2\u2010mutant and \u2010negative cell clones. However, trypsin treatment induced cell fusion in the TMPRSS2\u2010mutant and \u2010negative cell clones. Immunoblotting of TMPRSS2 showed WT\u2010dependent autocleavage of TMPRSS2; a 24\u2010kDa peptide was generated from the C\u2010terminal active domain in TMPRSS2\u2010WT cell clones, but not in the TMPRSS2\u2010mutant cell clones (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo). Thus, TMPRSS2\u2010WT cell clones showed functional protease activity against synthetic peptides in vitro and native substrates in vivo. HCV infectivity was also enhanced in a WT\u2010dependent manner by the TMPRSS2\u2010positive cell clones. TMPRSS2\u2010WT cell clones were more sensitive to HCV infection than the TMPRSS2\u2010mutant and \u2010negative cell clones (Fig. 5F).",

Unexpectedly, well\u2010known antiviral genes were rather highly expressed in livers with HCV\u2010high loads, including ISGs, inflammation/immune response\u2010related genes, and anti\u2010viral genes. For example, a markedly up\u2010regulated and typical ISG, OASL (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo), the function of which was initially unknown, inhibited replication of JFH\u20101 HCVcc, as described previously.15 Interestingly, epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT)\u2010related genes22, 23 are notably up\u2010regulated (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo), because an active EMT state was inhibitory to tight junction\u2010mediated viral infection, such as measles virus infection,24 and, most likely, for HCV infection. Thus, our comparative study showed that among two possible host responses to HCV infection and anti\u2010 and proviral responses, the antiviral response was the chief response in livers with high HCV loads. Antiviral responses are considered to result from high HCV loads, whereas proviral responses are a cause of high HCV loads. The persistence of high HCV loads may be caused by an unknown proviral mechanism by which the response is not sufficient to reduce HCV loads. Only six genes, including 4 ISGs, overlapped with previous studies that compared HCV\u2010negative and \u2010positive livers (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo).6, 8, 9, 25, 26 The genes first identified in this study are useful in elucidating the mechanisms of HCV control and persistence in the human liver. Genes such as TMPRSS2, whose roles are unknown in HCV control or persistence, remained to be described.

            "text": "We demonstrate here that trypsin\u2010like serine proteases are involved in the early stage of HCV infection, and that TMPRSS2 activates HCVcc infection in vitro. TMPRSS2 is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family21 and an activating protease in the airway epithelium for influenza virus infection. TMPRSS2 cleaves the surface glycoprotein, HA, to produce a fusion peptide and, so, facilitates the spread of the virus.27, 28, 29, 30 Thus, tissue expression of TMPRSS2 affects viral pneumotropism and pathogenicity. Recently, TMPRSS2 has also been shown to contribute to the spread of other respiratory viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and parainfluenza viruses, by cleaving the viral spike protein and F protein, respectively, leading to cell\u2010to\u2010virus and cell\u2010to\u2010cell fusion.31, 32, 33, 34, 35 Current reports using TMPRSS2\u2010knockout mice indicate that TMPRSS2 is essential for influenza virus pathogenesis in mice.36, 37, 38 It is not known yet what the target protein of TMPRSS2 is in HCV infection or whether fusion activity is induced. TMPRSS2 is preferentially localized at the apical membrane of hepatocytes in human livers with high HCV loads (Fig. 1B), and TMPRSS2\u2010induced protease activity was detected at the surface of Huh7 cells (Fig. 5C). Therefore, TMPRSS2 might also be involved in HCV entry or spread at or close to the tight junctions of hepatocytes in the human liver, where the components, claudin\u20101 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN), are key molecules for HCV entry and spread.39, 40 On the other hand, TMPRSS2 cleaves newly synthesized HA in the secretory pathway within the influenza virus\u2010infected cell30 and also plays a role in the release of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.41 To determine whether activation by TMPRSS2 occurs at the early stage of HCV entry and/or spread or at the late stage of HCV release, it is crucial to identify a protein cleaved and activated by TMPRSS2 during HCV infection.",

QSR and QTR are also sensitive sequences, shown by native proteins as targets. An active form of TMPRSS2 generated by autocleavage at QSR was produced in stably transfected cells in an enzyme\u2010dependent manner (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27426/suppinfo). TMPRSS2\u2010activated, HA\u2010mediated fusion occurred using the H3 subtype of HA (Udorn/72), in which the cleavage site is QTR (Fig. 5D,E). Thus, TMPRSS2 is broadly active on several cleavage\u2010site sequences; QXR, QAR, and QGR are the most sensitive, but RVRR is clearly resistant (Figs. 5C and 6B). Recently, the substrate for TMPRSS2 was characterized using various HA subtypes; most of the 18 subtypes of HA examined were cleaved by TMPRSS2, but with varying efficiency.42 Surveying the cleavage\u2010site sequences, such as (Q/E)XR, in the surface proteins of lipoviroparticles and host entry factors in HCV infection identifies several possible proteins as candidate targets of TMPRSS2: E2; apolipoprotein (APO)B; APOE; low\u2010density lipoprotein receptor; scavenger receptor class B, type I; CLDN1; and OCLN. The HCV fusion process depends on pH, the lipid composition of viral and target membranes, HCV E2, CD81, and CLDN1, though it remains unclear whether cellular proteases are required for this step.40 To identify the target of TMPRSS2 will be helpful in highlighting a novel activation mechanism for HCV infection.",

The cell\u2010surface, trypsin\u2010like serine protease was required for an early event in HCV infection/HCV entry. These results suggest that host transmembrane serine proteases, such as TMPRSS2, support HCV entry at the cell surface in human liver cells. The target of TMPRSS2 is a key molecule for proviral infection and its discovery will provide a new insight into antiviral strategy.",
