They affect many aspects of plant growth and their adaptation to the environment. These include seed germination, pollen development, fruit ripening, wounding responses and resistance to insects and pathogens. Particularly, jasmonates play vital roles in signaling processes that link environmental changes, including abiotic and biotic stresses, to an intracellular response from plants [2].",

            "text": "Many jasmonate responses are mediated via changing levels of synthesis of the jasmonate-regulated proteins (JRP). Some of these JRPs with diverse physiological functions have been characterized in detail, such as proteinase-inhibitors [3], [4], thionins [5], [6], phytoalexin-synthesizing enzymes [7], [8], cell wall proteins [9], pathogenesis-related proteins and osmotin [10], and lipoxygenase [11]. In barley leaves, jasmonate treatment activates the de novo synthesis and increases the accumulation of some proteins with relative molecular mass of 23,000 [12], 32,000 and 37,000 [13]. However, the functions of the 32,000 proteins named JRP-32, are still unclear [14]. The JRP-32 mRNAs were first detected in jasmonate-treated barley leaves but these sequences are only present in the GenBank database (GenBank accession numbers AF021256, AF021257, AF021258) and no further experimental work has been documented. We have identified a cDNA encoding the wheat homologue for JRP-32 namely Ta-JA1\n[14]. Ta-JA1 encoded protein together with some related proteins from Gramineae plants are modular proteins that contain the disease response and jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domains. They form a small protein family related to JRLs.",

Lectins function as central mediators of information transfer in biological systems by interacting with glycoproteins, glycolipids and oligosaccharides [15]. Plant lectins can be classified into 12 families according to their molecular structures, biochemical properties and sugar-binding specificities. Some lectin families, such as the legume lectins and the chitin-binding lectins composed of hevein domains, have been extensively studied [16]. The other types of lectins, namely jacalin-related lectins and the amaranthin family lectins, are less well characterized [16]. It is generally suggested that most plant lectins are directed against foreign glycans and other organisms either in recognition or in defense-related processes and that they therefore may play a crucial part in defense response against different pathogens (bacteria and fungi), phytophagous invertebrates and herbivorous animals. There is also data to suggest that some lectins may be also involved in cellular regulation and signaling [17].",

Newly identified JRLs exhibit a preferential binding with mannose and are probably involved in plant defense responses. Because Ta-JA1 protein contains both disease response and JRL domains, it would be interesting to know that if it belongs to a new family of lectins and its roles in plant disease resistance.

All other classical jacalin-related proteins clustered to another group (JRL, Fig. 1), including AiJacalin from Artocarpus heterophyllus, Calsepa from Calystegia sepium, Ipomelin from Ipomoea batatas, MornigaG and MornigaM from Morus nigra, Heltuba from Helianthus tuberosus, Banlec from Musa paradisiaca, Horcolin from Hordeum sativum\n[41], and OsSalT (also called Orysata from Oryza sativa\n[21]. These two groups of proteins, Monocot JRL and JRL, were more closely related to each other than to the monocot mannose-binding lectins (Fig. 1; Monocot Man Lec, ASAL from Allium sativum, LECCVA1 from Crocus vernus, LECCAMA1 from Arum maculatum, and TLCI1 from Tulipa gesneriana) and were mainly differentiated due to the presence of an additional N-terminal disease response domain in Monocot JRL. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe they represent the two different types of lectins. We tentatively name Ta-JA1 and related proteins as monocot jacalin-related lectins (Monocot JRL, Fig. 1).",

            "text": "Classical plant lectins including legume and chitin-binding lectins are constitutively expressed in plant tissues, but there is increasing evidence that some newly identified lectins are induced by biotic or abiotic stimuli [17]. The jacalin-related lectins (JRL) may be involved in plant defense responses, particularly for the sub-family of mannose-specific homologues (mJRL). It has been shown that treatment with methyl jasmonate can induce lectin activity in the leaves of rice, barley, wheat, maize and rye. Purification and characterization of the cDNA clones revealed that these lectins all belong to cytoplasmic mJRL [42]. This suggests that the induction of mJRL by jasmonates is a common phenomenon in cereals. Ta-JA1 is similar in protein structure to mJRL, as it contains a jacalin-related domain and has the beta-prism architecture [14]. Furthermore, an N-terminal domain equivalent to disease response protein is found in Ta-JA1. This inducible JRL with modular structure has been proposed as a different type of JRL [17]. Here the phylogenetic analyses of JRLs and monocot mannose-binding lectins confirmed that Ta-JA1 together with other related proteins might form a new type of lectins, namely monocot jacalin-related lectins (Monocot JRL). Monocot JRLs have two features that are distinct from classical JRLs. (1) All Monocot JRLs are found in the Poaceae family. The evolutional analysis of Crs-1 indicated that Monocot JRL homologues were present in tribe Triticeae (barley and wheat), Oryzeae (rice), and Andropogoneae (maize and sorghum), while being lost in the Aveneae [40]. (2) Monocot JRL proteins contain two functional domains. A disease response domain is located in their N-termini, while a JRL domain is located in their C-termini, in contrast with the classical JRL proteins that just have a JRL domain. Hence, Monocot JRL proteins can be regarded as modular proteins composed of an N-terminal disease response domain followed by a JRL domain. Physiological functions of Monocot JRL proteins remain largely open to be investigated. Their insect resistant properties have been demonstrated by feeding Drosophila melanogaster larvae with TaHfr-1 protein, a similar Monocot JRL protein that can be induced by wheat Hessian fly [43]. Crs-1 is a Ta-JA1 homologous gene in creeping bentgrass with up-regulation upon inoculation of dollar spot pathogen, implying a possible role in pathogen reactions [40]. There is currently no evidence for the involvement of Monocot JRL proteins in disease resistance.",

            "text": "The levels of Ta-JA1 protein in E. coli were quite low (Fig. 2). Generally, the low levels of protein may be due to two reasons. Firstly it may be that some membrane proteins cannot be synthesized in E. coli cells [44]. Ta-JA1 protein could be induced at low temperature (Fig. 2), therefore this was not case for Ta-JA1. Second, it may be that the induced protein is toxic to E. coli cells as is the case with the viscotoxins from European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) [45]. As shown in Fig. 3b, induction of Ta-JA1 protein markedly inhibited E. coli growth compared to control cells with just empty pET32a vector, with 55.8%\u201351.2% reduced cell density in logarithmic growth period. This indicated that the inhibition on cell growth of Ta-JA1 protein was caused by its toxicity to the cell. Direct supplement of the purified Ta-JA1 protein in LB medium, however, did not inhibit the growth of E. coli (unpublished data). This suggests that Ta-JA1 protein is active after entering the cell. Furthermore, the overexpression of Ta-JA1 gene in transgenic tobacco increased the disease resistance to bacterial (wildfire disease), fungal (black shank disease) and viral (TMV) pathogens. Therefore, Ta-JA1 has a broadened role in the plant defense response, which can act on general bacteria (E. coli) and harmful pathogens (wildfire, black shank and TMV pathogens). Inhibition of E. coli growth has been reported for a lectin that contains chitinase domain, BjCHI1 [46]. Transplastomic tobacco expressing BjCHI1 have also shown anti-fungal activities against different pathogens, including Colletotrichum truncatum, C. acutatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Ascochyta rabiei\n[47]. The actions of Ta-JA1 on disease resistance look similar with that of BjCHI1. Compared with specific disease resistant genes, the actions of Ta-JA1 on pathogens are not very strong, suggesting Ta-JA1 confers a basal but broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens. Ta-JA1 is the first Monocot JRL protein that has been shown to increase disease resistance. Considering Ta-JA1 as a jasmonate-regulated protein, which is in downstream of jasmonate-induced processes, Ta-JA1 may interact with microbes instead of inducing the other gene actions. In contrast, overexpression of an AP2/EREBP transcription factor, OPBP1, has been shown to enhance both disease resistance and salt tolerance of tobacco through regulating expression in sets of stress-related genes [31]. The mechanism of Ta-JA1 with microbes is interesting and warrants further investigation.",

Probability values between the control and transgenic tobacco were estimated by the Student's t-test and significant differences at P0.05 and P0.01 levels are marked by * and **, respectively.",
