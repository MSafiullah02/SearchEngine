Many organisms grow well in the absence of light (in fact natural sunlight will often kill them). Given these simple requirements for growth, it should be no surprise that environmental micro-organisms are ubiquitous in the indoor environment. Abundant growth, leading to high concentrations, can occur on any surface with sufficient water. This includes building materials that have been damaged by flooding, ground water or spillage [17] , anywhere that condensation of water occurs, such as air conditioning systems or where there is standing water, such as water cooling towers, and humidification systems. Microbial contamination has been identified within all parts of modern ventilation systems, including filters [18, 19] , air conditioning chillers [20] [21] [22] , drip pans [20] , humidifiers [23] , and ducts [24, 25] . In addition, mold and bacterial contamination is common in areas of food preparation or consumption.",

In almost all instances health effects result from inhalation of airborne microbial organisms, antigens, or toxins. This means the microbial substances must be aerosolized -in one of several ways. The most obvious is disturbance by human activity, including normal work activities, and cleaning. The latter can cause \"bursts\" of very high concentrations of microbes, creating a particular hazard for those present [26, 27] . In the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems the moving currents of air can act to aerosolize, and then efficiently disperse the microbes or their products throughout the occupied spaces. Once aerosolized the microbes, and their antigens or toxins, will remain airborne for some time and therefore can be inhaled by humans in that environment.",

Direct infectious complications are those that result from true infection of the human host by a microbial pathogen. Acquisition of infection is almost always by inhalation, although the infectious particles can impact on the upper or lower airways, with different resultant clinical manifestations. For example rhinoviruses that cause the common cold and influenza viruses, preferen-tially impact in the upper airways perhaps because they are bound to small airborne dust particles. By contrast, airborne TB bacteria are in droplet nuclei of 1-5 microns size. Particles of this size will reach the alveolar level of the lung and therefore cause a pneumonia-like condition. Other examples of potentially airborne microbes that cause direct infectious health effects include measles and SARS. Some organisms can cause infectious diseases, or immune mediated syndromes. For example Legionella pneumophila can result in pneumonia, termed \"Legionnaire's disease\", [29, 30] but can also be a systemic illness that is immune mediated, termed \"Pontiac Fever\" [29, 31] . It is unknown if these manifestations reflect differences in the infecting dose, or the host response.",

These include endotoxin -produced by certain bacteria, and mycotoxins produced by certain fungi. Experimental exposure to high concentrations of endotoxin has produced fever, difficulty breathing, and short-lived changes in lung function. [32] [33] [34] . In crosssectional population based studies, exposure to relatively low levels of endotoxin has been linked to non-specific building related symptoms, and sickness absence [35] [36] [37] . However, in these cross-sectional studies, the findings could also have been due to substantial confounding, since no relationship between endotoxin levels and health effects was found in several other studies. The health effects of mycotoxins, produced by certain fungi, such as Stachybotrys Atra, are more controversial [38] . Mycotoxin exposure has been linked to health effects in uncontrolled case reports and case series [39] . In one casecontrol study this toxin was linked to pulmonary haemorrhage in infants [40] . However in a subsequent publication, this study's methods were heavily criticized, findings reversed in re-analysis, and conclusions withdrawn -by the same agency that conducted the original case-control study [41] . In summary, although many microbes produce toxins, and intuitively toxins can not be good, there is inconclusive evidence they actually cause health effects in the concentrations found in the indoor environment.",

Typical outbreaks involve a large number of affected individuals who have similar clinical manifestations [21, [45] [46] [47] . Subsequent investigation revealed substantial microbial contamination by one, or multiple, microbes. In all outbreaks, improvement occurred when the source was eliminated. Interestingly, in a few outbreaks that were carefully investigated, exposed persons exhibited a range of clinical manifestations ranging from severe disease requiring treatment, to mild symptoms [45, 46] . Those with milder manifestations might normally have been overlooked or considered to have symptoms unrelated to the indoor environment. The microbial cause for these mildly affected persons was established only because others within the same indoor environment were more seriously affected. The variability of clinical manifestations in these outbreaks is unexplained, but most likely reflects variation in individual susceptibility due to age, gender, co-morbid illnesses, cigarette smoking, or other factors [48] . This variability of response has been repeatedly demonstrated, including under carefully controlled conditions [49] [50] [51] [52] .",

This is because in non-outbreak situations microbial levels are lower [54] [55] [56] [57] , and the link between these low microbial levels and health effects is much harder to establish. At lower concentrations of organisms, only the most susceptible of the exposed individuals will be affected, and their clinical manifestations may be mild and non-specific [48, 54] . As well, lower levels of microbial contamination are more difficult to measure accurately because of the variability of concentrations related to time of day, human activity, ambient temperature and humidity [58, 59] . When microbial concentrations are very high, these variations are relatively unimportant, but become progressively more important at lower concentrations. There is some evidence of the population impact of microbial exposures in the home environment from surveys of the health effects of bacteria and fungi in homes or residences [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Although not directly applicable, this is the most important source of information on the health effects of microbes. Even here the most consistent relationships with health effects have been with markers of bacterial and fungal growth, such as visible mold, or damp damage, and not with actual measured airborne microbial concentrations [61, 63, 66, [68] [69] [70] .",

In one study, an office worker with contagious TB infected many of her co-workers, some of whom had no direct contact but worked in offices ventilated with the same re-circulated air as the affected worker. This implied that the ventilation system, by recirculating germ-laden air, acted to disseminate the infection throughout the building. Transmission was mathematically related to ventilation level in this study [73] . A second study detected significantly higher transmission of TB infection to hospital workers on clinical units with lower levels of ventilation [74] .",

Prevention implies preventing the conditions that favour microbial growth. Given the dependence of microbes on water, the most successful and practical approach is to prevent water accumulation, condensation, or infiltration, as well as any subsequent water damage. This means installation of dehumidification systems where humidity levels are high such as environments at or below ground level (obviously not a problem on aircraft!). Prevention of water infiltration means water proofing the building shell, particularly at or below ground level [17] . Prevention of condensation with air-conditioning systems is not possible. Instead the objective is rapid removal of all condensate, because if water accumulates it will quickly become contaminated. Humidification systems should be designed without a reservoir of standing water. The best systems use steam humidification, rather than ultrasonic or other forms of nebulization of cool water [77] .",

In some cases, such as cleaning ventilation ducts, or changing filters, these actions can result in important release of microbial products, resulting in very high, albeit transient microbial exposures [26, 27] . Therefore these activities should be performed when the occupants are not present, and significant care must be taken to prevent an occupational hazard to those performing these tasks [27] . Microbial reduction can also be accomplished with germicidal chemicals, but it is important to recognize that these chemicals may themselves be associated with health effects. Therefore chemical cleaning must be done when the occupants are absent, and appropriate precautions must be taken to ensure the workers doing the cleaning are not exposed. Furthermore, sufficient time must have elapsed before the occupants so return, that all traces of the chemicals have dissipated.",

However, in other areas, such as within the HVAC system, UVGI is potentially highly useful within the ducts to sterilize the air, or to irradiate the air-conditioning systems to eliminate condensaterelated microbial contamination [81] . In one recent study UVGI irradiation of air-conditioning systems in 3 large office buildings resulted in a signifi-cant reduction of allergic, and systemic syndrome-type symptoms in 771 office workers [82] . The most significant improvement was seen in the most susceptible -i.e. workers who had a history of atopy or allergy, as well as non-smokers.

Filters can be effective to eliminate viable and non-viable microbes, as well as microbial particles. However, the efficiency of the filter is an important determinant of the beneficial effects. Although filters found in most HVAC systems will trap microbes that are adherent to airborne dust particles, they will not trap particles of 1-5 microns size [83] . These are termed respirable particles, as they can reach the alveoli when inhaled. Particles of this size may contain microbial antigens, such as proteins or cell wall parts, or viable bacteria, such as tuberculosis. These pathogenetically important particles will only be trapped by more efficient HEPA filters (high efficiency particulate air filters). HEPA filters will trap more than 99% of particles of 0.3 micron size or larger [83] . However these filters are much more costly, and because of their greater resistance they require greater fan strength and energy to operate, further increasing their cost, and limiting their applicability. An additional limitation of filters is that they must be changed frequently, as they become contaminated. Several reports have documented that poorly maintained filters can become a source of airborne microbial contamination [19, 84] . At the time of changing the filters, there can be a substantial airborne burst of microbes released which can pose significant hazards to those in the occupied space [85, 86] . Therefore it is recommended that filters are changed when the indoor environment is not occupied and the occupational hazard for those changing the filters is prevented by suitable protection [85, 86] .",

At very low indoor air exchange rates, very high concentrations of indoor contaminants can be seen. As ventilation is increased, these concentrations will decline rapidly at first, but the benefits become progressively less, with progressively higher air exchange rates, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 . Above six air exchanges per hour, further increases in ventilation will have little additional benefit. The disadvantages of increased ventilation include the increased fan strength required to achieve the ventilation, and the substantial energy costs to heat or cool as well as to humidify or dehumidify the outdoor air brought in [71] . It is because of these energy costs that outdoor air exchange rates have been reduced over the past 20 years in modern buildings and aircraft. Microbial transmission from human to human that is mediated by droplets or direct contact will not be affected by environmental conditions. Increasing levels of outdoor air supply will have little beneficial effect. However organisms that are transmitted from human to human by the airborne route, such as tuberculosis, measles, or influenza, will be affected by changes in ventilation [1, 3, 9, 10, 73] . Increasing the outdoor air supply will increase the removal of the airborne microbes, by replacing contaminated air with clean outdoor air. This will result in reduced probability of inhalation by humans. However, as with all other indoor pollutants, dilution of infectious microbes by outdoor air will be most effective if pre-existing ventilation levels are low, but will have diminishing returns above a certain level.",

There is some evidence of airborne transmission of microbes within aircraft, mostly from investigations of potential transmission of tuberculosis [88] . Tuberculosis has received more attention than other pathogens for several reasons. The disease is serious. Tuberculosis bacteria can survive in airborne droplet nuclei for more than 24 hours -potentially important during prolonged airflights. The condition is rare in many populations nowadays, making transmission events easier to detect than for common viruses such as the rhinovirus. Nine investigations of potential TB transmission aboard commercial aircraft have been published [13] [14] [15] 89] . In only two of the nine was evidence of transmission found [13, 15] . One was related to a flight attendant who was infectious for a prolonged period of time; despite this, the risk to passengers was very low, and far less than the risk for household contacts of the same contagious cases [13] . These investigations provide useful information because this transmission of TB can be considered a proxy of airborne transmission of many other pathogens whose transmission is much more difficult to measure [88] .",

This means screening the passengers as well as the crew. During the height of the SARS epidemic passengers were screened for fever and cough, although often only after arrival in certain countries. To prevent SARS transmission (and also prevent transmission of many other respiratory pathogens) one would have to screen all passengers and crew for fever and cough. Embarkation would be denied to anyone failing the screening. Apart from the logistic difficulties of screening all passengers rapidly prior to embarkation, this would also have substantial cost implications because of delayed travel. Other approaches to limiting transmission of potentially contagious respiratory disease would be to require wearing of masks by such passengers. However, wearing masks may be seen as branding the passengers, creating stigma and substantial anxiety for the affected passenger and all around them. This would also raise the possibility of later legal repercussions. Nonetheless, in an epidemic of a serious airborne transmitted illness such as SARS, these measures may be justified to protect other passengers, and to diminish the international spread of disease.",

These energy costs have driven aircraft manufacturers and operators to minimize outdoor air supplied to aircraft cabins over the last two decades. However certain minimum standards must be maintained in order to minimize the risk to passengers.

For these situations source control is the only effective method, but this implies screening passen-gers prior to embarkation, with denial to ill passengers on grounds of possible contagiousness.
