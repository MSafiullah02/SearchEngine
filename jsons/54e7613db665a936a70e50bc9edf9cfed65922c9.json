            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 infection which causes acute encephalitis, hepatitis, and chronic demyelination, is one of the experimental models for multiple sclerosis. Previous studies showed that lethal infection of \u00df 2 -microglobulin 'knockout' (\u00df 2 M(-/-)) mice required 500-fold less virus and viral clearance was delayed as compared to infection of immunocompetent C57Bl/6 (B6) mice. To investigate the mechanism of the increased susceptibility of \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice to MHV-A59, we studied organ pathology and the distribution of viral antigen and RNA during acute and chronic infection. A59-infected \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice were more susceptible to acute encephalitis and hepatitis, but did not have increased susceptibility to demyelination. Viral antigen and RNA distribution in the brain was increased in microglia, lymphocytes, and small vessel endothelial cells while the distribution in neurons and glia was similar in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice and B6 mice. Acute hepatitis and thymus cortical hypoplasia in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice were delayed in onset but pathologic changes in these organs were similar to those in B6 mice. The low rate of demyelination in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice was consistent with the low dose of the virus given. A less neurotropic virus MHV-2, caused increased parenchymal inflammation in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice, but without demyelination. Thus, CD8+ cells were important for viral clearance from endothelial cells, microglia and inflammatory cells, but not from neuronal and glial cells. In addition, CD8+ cells played a role in preventing the spread of encephalitis.",

MHV infection of the CNS induces enhanced expression of MHC class I antigens on brain cells in vitro and in vivo [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, the significance of MHC induction in mHV infection is still not clear. It can poten-tially enable cytotoxic phenomena on neural cells including oligodendrocytes, by CD8+ cells which require recognition by MHC class I antigens on the surface of the target cells. In SCID mice, in which the B-and T-cell immune components are nonfunctional, infection by MHV does not produce significant demyelination [20] , suggesting that a subset of the affected immune cells in SCID mice are important for demyelination. The cells which affect the rate and quality of the demyelinating process were characterized as Thy1+ cells [21] , presumably a subset of T cells.",

In order to examine whether CD8+ cells also affected demyelination, we previously studied the ability of MHV-A59 to produce demyelination in \u00df 2 -microglobulin 'knockout' (\u00df 2 M(-/-)) mice [24, 25] . Since the \u00df 2microglobulin is part of the MHC class I protein, disruption of \u00df 2 -microglobulin expression interferes with normal expression of MHC class I and the development of functional CD8+ cells in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice [26] . We found that demyelination developed in some \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice following infection with a lethal dose of MHV-A59, thus CD8+ cells were not an absolute requirement for demyelination [24] . However, the pathogenesis of the disease and the reasons for the increased susceptibility of \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice to MHV infection were still unknown. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effect of lack of CD8+ cells on organ pathology, and the cellular reservoirs for viral infection, in both acute and chronic MHV infection of \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice.",

Disease in either B6 or 129/J mice was identical. Normal susceptible mice (B6) infected with 5,000 PFU/mouse (1-2 LD 50 dose) of the neurotropic virus MHV-A59 developed both encephalitis and hepatitis. Following IC inoculation with 10 PFU of MHV-A59 (2 LD 50 ), \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice developed clinical signs of acute disease including ruffled fur, hunched position, decreased motility and appetite, lethargy, limb weakness, and eventually death. These clinical signs were similar to the ones observed in B6 mice infected with 5,000 PFU of MHV-A59. Thus, \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice required 500-fold less virus than B6 mice to produce a similar mortality rate and clinical disease. Previous analysis of viral titers in organs of the two types of mice infected with MHV-A59 showed that \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice infected with 10 PFU had higher and more sustained titers of virus as compared to B6 mice infected with 5,000 PFU of MHV-A59 [24] . These results were consistent with the hypothesis that CD8+ cells play an important role in MHV clearance from the organs of infected mice.",

We asked whether the number of infected cells was increased and whether additional cell types served as reservoirs for viral replication during infection of \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice with MHV-A59. We performed immunohistochemistry on brain sections from \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice, during acute infection with MHV-A59, to detect the presence of viral antigen. Immunohistochemistry in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice revealed viral antigen in neurons in a similar intensity and anatomic distribution to that seen in B6 mice [28] . The infected neurons seen during acute encephalitis were generally found in the same anatomic location of the inflammatory infiltrates (as described in the previous section). However, there was increased viral antigen in numerous microglia, lymphocytes, endothelial and meningeal cells in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice as compared to B6 mice [28] which rarely presented viral antigens in these cell types during infection with MHV-A59 ( fig. 1 ). We performed in situ hybridization on tissue sections of MHV-A59-infected \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice with MHV-specific probes, in order to determine the distribution of viral genome during acute encephalitis. Viral RNA and antigen had similar distribution. The signal of viral RNA in MHV-A59-infected \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice was seen within neurons in olfactory-limbic areas in addition to many microglia, perivascular lymphocytes, and in capillary endothelial cells. Double staining with GFAP revealed many GFAP-negative cells, positive for viral RNA. There were also many GFAP-positive cells which were negative for viral RNA. Many of these cells had abundant cytoplasm and ramified thick processes characteristic of reactive astrocytes, indicating reactive gliosis. Occasional GFAPpositive cells were also positive for viral RNA suggesting that only a small percent of astrocytes are infected ( fig. 1 ). Thus during acute infection of \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice with MHV-A59, the distribution of viral RNA and antigen were similar in neurons, microglia endothelial cells and a small number of glial cells including GFAP-positive astrocytes. The pathologic changes during acute meningoencephalitis also included reactive gliosis. In situ hybridization for viral genome combined with RCA-1 staining showed viral genome in microglia and endothelial cells, similar to the immunohistochemical results for viral antigens.",

Four-week-old \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice were inoculated i.c. with MHV-2 and analyzed, at various intervals postinfection, for histopathology and viral titers in organs. Histology revealed both acute hepatitis and acute encephalitis. Acute encephalitis was observed in several periventricular areas especially the lateral and 4th ventricles. Mononuclear lymphocytic infiltration involved the choroid plexus, the ependyma and in the surrounding brain parenchyma especially in the brainstem ( fig. 2 ). There was no involvement of other areas of the brain including areas that are typically involved in A59 infection of B6 mice. By contrast, B6 mice infected with MHV-2 showed mostly inflammation of the meninges and choroid plexus while brain parenchyma was only minimally involved. Sustained titers of infectious virus were detected by plaque assay were detected in both brains and livers of \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice infected with MHV-2.

The amount of involvement of neuronal and glial cells infection was relatively similar in \u00df 2 M(-/-) mice and B6 mice.

However, the two strains differ in the degree of CNS involvement. While MHV-A59 produces acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination, MHV-2 produced much less encephalitis and no demyelination.
