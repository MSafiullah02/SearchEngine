The worldwide outbreak affected more than 8000 patients from over 30 countries with an associated cumulative mortality of 9.2% 1. A new coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) has been aetiologically linked to SARS 2, 3, 4. The supporting evidence includes serological studies, detection of the viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010based molecular methods, and viral isolation from respiratory specimens 2, 3, 4, 5. Although a highly sensitive diagnostic test is not available and SARS\u2010CoV is not detected in every clinically\u2010defined case 5, monkey inoculation experiments reproduce a similar disease in the primate to that in the human and further strengthen the aetiological role of SARS\u2010CoV 6. Much has been documented on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS. Epidemiological modelling shows that SARS\u2010CoV is highly contagious. However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS\u2010CoV are limited.",

These viruses have only rarely been associated with more severe respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia in neonates, the elderly or immunocompromised patients 7, 8, 9. However, SARS is a lower respiratory tract disease. Upper respiratory tract symptoms are uncommon and mild 10. Moreover, the genomic sequence of SARS\u2010CoV is distinct from other coronaviruses, including the two known human pathogenic coronaviruses 229E and OC43 11, 12. On the basis of ultrastructural findings, SARS\u2010CoV appears to infect lung pneumocytes 13, 14. However, extra\u2010pulmonary manifestations including diarrhoea, lymphopaenia, impaired liver function, and elevation of non\u2010cardiac creatine kinase are common and suggest that the virus may have tropism for non\u2010pulmonary tissues 10. Thus, the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS\u2010CoV is likely to be distinct from that of the known human coronaviruses. At present, comprehensive documentation of the various cell types and organs infected by SARS\u2010CoV is lacking. In this report, we investigate the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS\u2010CoV in fatal SARS cases by in situ hybridization.",

Six SARS autopsy cases in our hospital outbreak in March 2003 were included and the outbreak was also epidemiologically linked to outbreaks in other countries 10, 15. The diagnosis of SARS was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 16 and in these six cases, SARS\u2010CoV was isolated from post\u2010mortem tissues. All patients but one had received high\u2010dose steroids and ribarvirin treatment and all died with respiratory failure. The lungs and trachea, but not the other upper respiratory tract tissues, were studied. All other major organs and tissues, except the brain, were also available for investigation. The post\u2010mortem findings were dominated by diffuse alveolar damage 10. Virus culture results were also available. In brief, coronavirus isolation was performed using an African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell line. When a cytopathic effect was observed from Vero cells, the supernatants from these positive cell cultures were tested by reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2010PCR. Among these six cases, SARS\u2010CoV was isolated from lung tissues in three of six cases and small intestinal tissues in four of five cases. Virus was not isolated from other tissues, including the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen in all cases, and lymph nodes, bone marrow, and muscles in two cases (Table 1).",

RNA from SARS\u2010CoV strain Su10 (Genbank Accession No AY282752) was used as a template to generate a 700\u2010bp RT\u2010PCR product. The RT\u2010PCR product corresponds to nucleotides 26 401\u201327 100, matching the putative membrane protein of SARS\u2010CoV. The nucleotide sequence of this probe does not show significant homology to the genomes of other coronaviruses, including the two known human pathogenic strains 229E and OC43. The probe was labelled with digoxigenin by nick translation (DIG\u2010Nick Translation Mix, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Two micrograms of the RT\u2010PCR products was incubated at 14 \u00b0C for 2 h. Completion of labelling was checked by testing an aliquot of the reaction mix on 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. Smearing and disappearance of the \u223c700 bp band were used to judge the adequacy of labelling. Formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin wax\u2010embedded tissues were cut into 5 \u00b5m sections. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were treated with microwave heating in an 800 W domestic microwave oven at medium power for 10 min in 0.01 m sodium citrate buffer. Post\u2010fixation was carried out in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min after washing and cooling in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS). Hybridization was performed at high stringency with 2 ng/\u00b5l denatured probe at 42 \u00b0C for 16 h in 50 \u00b5l of hybridization mix [50% formamide, 10% dextran sulphate in 2\u00d7 saline sodium citrate (SSC)] under a 22 \u00d7 50 mm coverslip in a moist chamber. Excess probe was removed by washing in 2\u00d7 SSC for 5 min at room temperature. This was followed by three high stringency washes in 0.1\u00d7 SSC for 10 min at 61 \u00b0C. Immunological detection was conducted using a DIG Nuclear Acid Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after incubation with 1% Blocking Reagent (bottle 5) for 30 min, the sections were incubated with sheep anti\u2010digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (vial 3) diluted at 1 : 375 for 2 h at room temperature. After three separate washes with washing buffer [0.1 m maleic acid, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.5), 0.3% Tween 20], the signal was developed using 5\u2010bromo\u20104\u2010chloro\u20103\u2010indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium salt (NBT) (vial 4), which produces an insoluble blue precipitate indicating hybrid molecules. Sections were counterstained with methyl green. Cell block preparations from Vero cell cultures with and without inoculation with SARS\u2010CoV were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The signal specificity was also assessed by (1) digestion of the sections with RNase A (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma; RNase A was pretreated by boiling at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min to remove possible DNase contaminants) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C before the hybridization and (2) omission of the probes in the hybridization mixture. In addition, tissue sections form three autopsy cases of non\u2010SARS patients collected during the SARS outbreak in our hospital were included as negative controls. All three of these cases were negative for viral isolation and serology for SARS. Tissues sections of various organs, including lung, intestine, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow and muscles, were studied.",

Positive ISH signals were detected in those samples only when SARS\u2010CoV was isolated by virological cell culture in SARS patients. Lung sections from three cases and small intestinal sections from four cases were all positive for viral culture. These samples were all positive for ISH (Table 1). Other tissue samples, including the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and muscles, were all culture\u2010negative and they were all found to be ISH\u2010negative (Table 1).

The viral genome, as revealed by ISH, either was present diffusely throughout the cytoplasm of the infected cells or formed aggregates within the cytoplasm. In the lungs of fatal cases, multinucleate cells are one of the characteristic features of SARS. Detectable signals, however, were not seen in these cells. Detached cells in the alveoli might be detached pneumocytes or macrophages. The nature of the viral RNA\u2010positive detached cells in the alveolar spaces was ascertained by immunofluorescence\u2013FISH with cytokeratin (AE1/AE3, Figures 3A and 3B) and macrophage (CD68) markers (Figure 3D).

FISH showed the same findings as ISH in the small intestinal sections. Double immunofluorescence\u2013FISH with cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) further confirmed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010positive cells were enterocytes (Figure 5A, arrows). The no\u2010probe control (Figure 5B) again indicated that autofluorescence signals were minimal in the detached surface enterocytes (arrows). It is important to note that the tissue responses in the intestines were quite different from those in the lungs.

Human coronavirus or coronavirus\u2010like particles (CVLPs) have been suggested to be the aetiological agent of diarrhoea in susceptible subjects, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and in children from developing countries 20, 21. However, enteric tissue tropism of SARS\u2010CoV has not been documented. Our results indicate that the surface enterocytes are infected by the SARS\u2010CoV, but in contrast to the lungs, no evidence of tissue destruction or inflammatory processes was seen in association with viral infection in the intestines. The mechanism underlying diarrhoea in SARS remains unclear. However, our observations suggest that the underlying pathology might well be in the small intestine and that active viral replication within intestinal cells rather than an inflammatory lesion might be responsible for the pathophysiology of the SARS\u2010related diarrhoea. Nevertheless, our study indicates that tissue responses to SARS\u2010CoV infection are distinct in different organs.",

Emerging data suggest that differences in the spike protein of the virus may be related to tissue tropism of bovine coronavirus 22. The host cell surface proteins are also important. The membrane protein aminopeptidase N (CD13) acts as a receptor for human coronavirus 229E and mediates its tissue tropism 23. CD13 is expressed on various polarized epithelial cells, including surface enterocytes, but not pneumocytes. It is also interesting to note that the macrophages in the lungs in these cases also expressed CD13 (KFT, unpublished data). However, even in areas with virus\u2010positive pneumocytes, none of the adjacent macrophages were infected. The surface receptor for SARS\u2010CoV is currently unknown, but our data suggest that CD13 is probably not the receptor for SARS\u2010CoV.",
