            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia causing by unknown virus were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, origin of the virus was traced back to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. On January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV [1]. The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-Cov-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), with which it shares more than 79% of its sequence [2]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses which belong to order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae [3], and have been classified into four major groups: \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b2-CoVs, \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs [4]. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV [5]. The whole genome sequence of Wuhan new virus (WH-Human_1) was first released on Jan 10, 2020 [6]. Five typical ORFs were identified on one complete SARS-CoV-2 genome (29870-bp, excluding the poly (A) tail) in GenBank (accession number MN908947), including ORF1ab polyprotein (7096-aa), spike glycoprotein (1273-aa), envelope protein (75-aa), membrane protein (222-aa), and nucleocapsid protein (419-aa) [7]. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused epidemic in China, as well as infection cases worldwide. This report describes diagnostic process of a COVID-19 patient from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene, then to two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) by RT-PCR testing. The case provides an example for diagnosing suspected COVID-19, despite successive negative results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the early stages. Successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR as well as clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images, should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence.",

He disclosed that he had dinner with friends in the restaurant in Ningbo on January 14. He and his friends had no tour history to Wuhan, the epidemic focus of COVID-19 outbreak in China. After dinner, he visited Ningbo Haishu Third Hospital for drunkenness, nausea, and vomiting (details not available). He had a fever three days later, and the highest temperature was up to 38.5 \u00b0C. On January 18, he presented to the emergency in Ningbo First Hospital, with cough, chills, headache dizziness, and muscle ache, but without expectoration, stuffy nose and running nose, chest distress and chest pain. Routine blood test revealed lymphocytopenia (Table 1\n). The empiric therapy were administrated with levofloxacin, cefuroxime axetil and aloxicillin (details not available). He still had a fever and visited Ningbo Haishu Third Hospital on January 22. C-reactive protein increased to 8.50 mg/L, antigen test for influenza A and B was negative, chest CT images showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung.",

The policy was initiated that fever patients can only visit fever clinic at first. RT-PCR testing is the gold standard to diagnose SARS-Cov-2. On January 26, first batch of four registration certificate of Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit was issued by the State Food and Drug Administration for the emergency, without a series of clinical trials.",

Given successive single positive nucleocapsid gene on day9 and day 10, we hypothesize that this fluorescent quantitative PCR kit is more sensitive to amplify nucleocapsid gene than orf1ab gene, samples with low viral load might result in single positive nucleocapsid gene. From Fig. 1, Ct value of nucleocapsid gene on day 10 (31.54) was less than it on day 9 (32.84), which showed a trend toward increasing levels of virus. On day 16, two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) were tested along with higher viral load. If we comply with the pending criterion of single positive gene in old edition guidelines, diagnosis of a COVID-19 patient with low viral load will be delayed or even missed. Therefore, it\u2019s advisable to amend the diagnostic criterion of single positive gene. Fortunately, we treated this case as a COVID-19 patient, 20 days before fifth edition guidelines published on February 21 [9].",

In this case, therapies for recurrent fevers were ineffective in the early stages, we considered the patient as a COVID-19 one, despite negative results of RT-PCR testing on day 3 and day 8. Successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR caused results of single positive nucleocapsid gene on day 9 and day 10, two positive target genes on day 16. However, false negative factors should be excluded: poor sample quality; sample collection time (too early or too late); incorrect storage, transportation and handling; virus mutation, PCR inhibition and so on. Single positive nucleocapsid gene was reported on day9 and day 10, but deep sputum specimen on day 10 was reported negative, we speculate the negative result might be a false negative for poor sample quality. The sputum specimen was difficult to be collected because of small sputum volume. Although by atomization with hypertonic saline, the sputum specimen was very sticky, we speculate the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction was incomplete, and affected the accuracy of the testing result subsequently. Therefore, collecting a qualified specimen plays a key role in obtaining a correct result.",

Although secondary bacterial infection was considered, and moxifloxacin administration was effective, but we hypothesize that the virus load increased along with the continuous replication of the virus, then the patient\u2019s immunity was consumed to cause secondary bacterial infection. Moreover, secondary bacterial infection accelerated the replication of the virus, even promoted the transfer of the virus from deep part of the lung to the throat. The hypothesis needs further observation and verification, which provides a new way to diagnose highly suspected cases with negative results of RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2.",
