Samples should be taken from the affected individuals and their contacts (serum, swabs, spinal fluid, tissue, etc.) and from the environment (water, feces, food [especially seafood and fish], etc.). Implementation of systematic procedures and databases, including integration of sample labeling, registration of essential information (such as date and place of collection, nature of the sample, and any other relevant data), conservation, and storage are always critical points to track back every result obtained during the investigation (20). Samples should ideally be split into aliquots and immediately processed as soon as they are received at the laboratory, but adequate means for conservation and storage of samples should be available in case further analysis will be required. In this regard, it should be noted that enteric viruses are usually relatively stable and persist in normal environmental conditions for long periods; therefore, liquid samples are adequately stored at 4\u00b0C for several days and at \u221270\u00b0C for years, but freeze-thaw of samples should be avoided.

Coarse material might be decanted for at least 2 h at room temperature or, preferably, overnight at 4\u00b0C. If the decanted water still contains too many fine particles in suspension, it can be prefiltered through a Whatman filter paper, or further cleaned up by centrifugation at 9800g for 20 min in a Beckman (Avanti J25 I) centrifuge using a JA-14 rotor. This procedure yields a clarified supernatant already suitable for filtration.Filtration: We use the filtration system outlined in Fig. 1. Basically, a peristaltic pump drives the liquid sample through a prefilter and an electropositive filter (see\nSection 2) placed consecutively down the flow. Optimal flow rate is dependent on the size of the filter. For CUNO 47-mm filters, the maximum flow rate is 70 mL/min.Elution: Once the sample has been filtered, the filter must be removed from its cassette and incubated for 5 to 10 min, with shaking, in 10 mL elution buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 9.5, with 3% beef extract [see\nNotes 2 and 3]).Neutralization: Because excessive exposure to alkaline pH may produce loss of virus viability, the pH of the eluate must be neutralized by the addition of 0.1 M HCl immediately after incubation (see\nNote 4). After neutralization, and before storage, we find that filter sterilization of eluates through 0.2-\u00b5m pore-diameter syringe filters is useful to have them ready for further analysis that require sterile conditions, such as virus isolation in cell culture.\n\n",

Stored viruses must be labeled and registered in a way that allows easy identification. Registration data should include at least: name of sample, origin, date, and cells used for isolation and number of passages.

Similarly, solid samples (food, feces) are better stored after the extraction step. In the case of seafood, filtering organs (gills) accumulate virus filtered from the water; thus, a minimal processing step consisting of dissection and separation of gills will facilitate their storage.The volume of elution buffer necessary for an adequate virus recovery is determined by the surface of the filter.To prevent microbial growth, it is convenient to filter-sterilize the elution buffer and store it at 4\u00b0C, being careful to open it under sterile (laminar flow hood) conditions.Some viruses completely lose their viability upon alkaline treatment during filtration through electropositive filters. On the other hand, at high concentrations, beef extract is directly toxic for most cell cultures, thus being necessary to \u201cdilute the concentrates\u201d to avoid this effect (this drawback can be partially overcome by reducing the beef extract content of the elution buffer to 1%). Consequently, the filtration-elution method is less effective when virus infectivity is to be tested. However, detection of virus by molecular methods is not affected by these drawbacks.For this purpose we use ultracentrifuge rotor SW28 (Beckman). The capacity of the tubes for this rotor is approximately 38 mL. For higher volumes of sample one should fill as many tubes as needed, whereas for volumes lower than 38 mL, one should dilute it with distilled water up to 38 mL, or, alternatively, use tubes and rotors suited for lower volumes, i.e., SW41 (12 mL).Virus recovery is increased when, before resuspension, pellets are kept overnight at 4\u00b0C with a RNase-free water overlay.The homogenization is more efficient after an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with extraction buffer.One aliquot can be treated with chloroform, and another one can be filter-sterilized. Comparison of the results of infectivity in cell culture obtained in each case indicates whether the cytopathic effect is due to enveloped or nonenveloped viruses.Many commercial kits for RNA extraction are optimized for tissue or cell extractions, and thus are not well suited for liquid samples. We have found that those labeled as \u201cviral RNA extraction kit\u201d are better suited for the purposes discussed in this chapter.The volume of the inoculum should ideally be high enough to overlay all the surface of the cell monolayer, but as low as possible to increase virus concentration to facilitate virus-cell contact. As a general rule, 15 to 20% of the volume of medium used for cell growth is adequate for inoculation.Low fetal calf serum (FCS) concentrations during the infection (1\u20132%) are recommended in most cases, as the growth of many enteroviruses is prevented by FCS components, and remarkably by bovine serum albumin.It is helpful to \u201cmock-infect\u201d one flask in parallel as a control for null CPE.To increase virus content in the supernatant, before clarification, freeze-thaw the centrifuge tubes containing the infection supernatant three times successively.When the thermal cycler does not have a top heater, then overlay the reaction mixture with 30 \u00b5L of mineral oil.Extreme care should be taken when manipulating ethidium bromide, as it is a powerful mutagen. Gloves should be worn when working with solutions containing the mutagen and all reactive and gels in contact with it should be carefully discharged in appropriate containers.\n",
