In contrast, most female COVID-19 patients have elevated testosterone levels (60%) without alterations in dihydrotestosterone levels.

First SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans were reported in December in Wuhan, China 1 . It is believed to have a zoonotic origin, albeit the animal reservoir is still under investigation. However, the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 possessed the ability to transmit from human-to-human, thereby rapidly spreading worldwide. On February 11 th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). One month later, on 11 th March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be broad, ranging from mild upper respiratory illnesses to severe primary pneumonia with respiratory failure and death 2 . A retrospective cohort study, which enrolled 191 inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, analyzed patient demographics and laboratory findings on hospital admission since its first occurrence in December 2019 in China. They reported that older age, high SOFA score, d-dimers greater than 1\u00b5g/ml as well as comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, type II diabetes) present poor prognostic markers at an early stage 2 . In January 2020, first patients in Europe were diagnosed with the COVID-19, describing 3 male and 2 female patients, all of whom had travelled from China 3 . In New York City, a case study on 5,700 hospitalized patients also revealed hypertension, obesity and diabetes as the most common comorbidities 4 . A total of 373 patients (33.5% female) were treated in intensive care units and 320 of them received invasive mechanical ventilation 4 . With SARS-CoV-2 continuing to infect humans worldwide, it was repeatedly reported that men with COVID-19 are at higher risk to develop severe and even lethal outcome compared to women, independent of age 5 . Thus, it has become of utmost importance to understand why men are more likely to die from COVID-19 than women.",

Herein, 14.3% of males showed low, 28.6% very low and 25.7% extremely low testosterone levels. Importantly, of the 9 male COVID-19 patients who died, 7 had low testosterone levels, 1 patient had normal testosterone levels at the lowest percentile and 1 patient presented testosterone levels within normal range (data not shown). In contrast, 60% of females showed elevated testosterone levels. Among the 3 female patients who died, one had elevated testosterone levels. In general, the majority of male COVID-19 patients (68.6%) present reduced testosterone levels, while the majority of female patients (60%) show elevated testosterone levels (Figure 1a) . We then measured levels of the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in male and female patients. Majority (98%) of total testosterone is bound to SHBG and only 2% is in its free, bioavailable form. Thus, in some cases, testosterone deficiencies might be masked by elevated SHBG levels. Most female patients (60%) presented elevated testosterone levels. In contrast, 28.5% of male COVID-19 patients presented elevated SHBG levels. Interestingly, in 7 of these 10 patients, elevated SHBG was not combined with low testosterone levels (data not shown). This suggests that an additional 7 patients with \"normal\" appearing testosterone levels might indeed suffer from masked testosterone deficiencies. Taken together, these data suggest that the vast majority of male COVID-19 patients present low testosterone levels. Moreover, male COVID-19 patients with low testosterone levels seem to have an elevated risk to die than those with normal testosterone levels.",

Only levels of eotaxin, which is produced e.g. by IFN-\u03b3 stimulated endothelial cells and TNFactivated monocytes, were slightly reduced in female patients. Thus, cytokine and chemokine responses do not seem to differ between male and female COVID-19 patients simply due to their sex. (Figure 2m ). IL-2 is mainly produced by activated T-cells. High IL-2 levels are associated with the vascular leak syndrome 15, 16 . Lung endothelial cells, which express high-affinity IL-2R, the receptor of IL-2, are believed to induce via IL-2 binding, vascular permeability that in turn leads to life-threatening pulmonary oedema. These findings show that differential cytokines and chemokines correlate with disease severity in males and females. In males, an increase of a series of inflammatory cytokines correlates with disease severity. Herein, particularly factors involved in angiogenesis and endothelial function seem to be altered in their homeostasis. In females, only IL-2, which is also involved in vascular homeostasis, seems to be a correlate of disease severity.",

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were elevated in 4 out of 35 male patients (11.4%). Elevated FSH levels in these male patients were combined with elevated LH levels. In 40% of female patients, FSH levels were reduced, which may indicate loss of ovarian function. Other hormones, such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3 and T4 were within normal ranges in almost all male patients (91.4% (TSH), 91.4% (T3), 97.1% (T4)) and the majority of female patients (70% (TSH), 70% (T3), 100% (T4)). This does not indicate major defects in the general metabolism, indicating no impairment of thyreotrope axis or other dysregulations due to critical illness. Cortisol levels were elevated in 51.4% of male and 80% of female COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that a distinct proportion of male patients (6 out of 35; 17.1%) show primary hypogonadism. The remaining proportion on the other hand (18 out of 35; 51.4%) of male COVID-19 patients present low testosterone levels that is not of testicular but likely of hypothalamic origin. Obese male COVID-19 patients are more likely to have elevated estradiol levels Estradiol levels were elevated in 45.7% of male COVID-19 patients and reduced in 22.9%",

Interestingly, most of the cytokines and chemokines altered in male COVID-19 patients are involved in inflammation (IL-6, IL-1\u00df, IFN-\u03b3), immune activation and migration (MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-5, IL-7), anti-inflammatory pathways (IL-10), angiogenesis and endothelial function (FGF, VEGF, IFN-\u03b3), wound healing (PDGF-BB).
