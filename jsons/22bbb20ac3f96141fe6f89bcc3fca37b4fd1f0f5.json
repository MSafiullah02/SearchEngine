            "text": "In response to the global pandemic of the last four months, some progress has been made in understanding the molecular-level host interactions of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-hostmicrobiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by the viral invasion. We carry out a comparative functional analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight COVID-19, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients and twenty healthy controls. The resulting functional profiles clearly separate the cohorts, even more sharply than just their corresponding taxonomic profiles. We also detect distinct pathway signatures in the respiratory tract microbiome that consistently distinguish COVID-19 patients from both the CAP and healthy cohorts. These include increased vitamin, drug, nucleotide, and energy metabolism during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contrasted with decreased amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. This comparative analysis indicates consistent differences in COVID-19 respiratory tract metatranscriptomes compared to CAP and healthy samples.",

Additionally, understanding changes in the microenvironment within the host can yield insights into related biological processes perturbed by the virus. The respiratory tract microbiome community composition during pathogen infections has been studied previously, along with its predictivity of clinical outcomes and associated potential probiotic interventions. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Studies profiling the respiratory microbiome community in COVID-19 patients are also beginning to appear. 1, [8] [9] [10] To better understand the role of the microbiome in COVID-19, we introduce a functional analysis of recently published metatranscriptomes 8 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients, healthy subjects, and communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. While Shen et al. 8 focused on the SARS-Cov-2 genomes and taxonomic profiling of the microbiomes, here we perform functional profiling to characterize active biological processes.",

Several features with decreased relative abundance were related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Similar observations were recently made in a comprehensive study of microbiomes in mice infected with the influenza virus. 15 With limited clinical data available for these patients it is unclear if administered therapies had an effect on the detected microbiome differences and the detected subclusters of COVID-19 samples. The comparative approach taken here carefully avoids possible experimental variation and resulting biases within individual samples, and focuses on detecting robust and consistent differences between cohorts.",
