In addition there are a number of other viruses and bacteria that colonise the oral cavity and respiratory tract as well as blood borne microbes which represent a pathogenic risk. Notably, there is an increase in occurrence of antimicrobial\u2010resistant bacteria within hospital environments which subsequently represent a growing healthcare problem (6). Pathogenic microorganisms have the potential to be transmitted in dental settings through (1) direct contact with blood, oral fluids, or other patient materials; (2) indirect contact with contaminated objects (e.g. instruments, equipment or surfaces); (3) contact of conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa with droplets containing microorganisms (aerosols) generated from an infected person and propelled by coughing, sneezing, talking or use of dental instruments, e.g. sonic/ultrasonic scalers; and (4) inhalation of airborne microorganisms that can remain in the environment for long periods (7). It is therefore necessary that infection control procedures address issues of hand hygiene, instrument sterilisation, sharps handling and the use of protective barriers.",

Within University hospitals, where new dental personnel are trained and large numbers of patients are treated, it is therefore imperative that thorough and robust training in infection control procedures is provided. Indeed dental undergraduate students provide a significantly increased potential for cross\u2010contamination compared with more experienced members of the dental team, emphasising the need to ensure that they are thoroughly trained and aware of protocols necessary to minimise the risk both to themselves and to their patients (8, 9, 10).",

Indeed, UK General Dental Council (GDC) guidelines state that dental graduates should be able to \u2018implement and perform satisfactory infection control and prevent physical, chemical or microbiological contamination in the practice of dentistry\u2019 (11). In addition, the generation of qualified dentists educated in infection control procedures is important in extending compliance in private dental practices within the community. Employing dentists not only have a responsibility to protect patients, but are also required to provide a safe environment for their employees by ensuring staff immunisations, eye and face protection, surgery clothing, protection against saliva/blood splatter and inoculation injuries. Indeed, \u2018failure to employ adequate methods of cross\u2010infection control would almost certainly render a dentist liable to a charge of serious professional misconduct\u2019 (12). Whilst an effective infection control programme and concerns over transmission of disease has always been an essential and integral part of the dental practice, over the past decade, guidelines for infection control have become more evidence\u2010based, enabling strategies to be devised which can prevent disease transmission by interrupting one or more links in the chain of contamination.",

Student competency in infection control was determined by a three component assessment which included; (a) a written test, covering the key points in the \u2018Hospital Infection Control Policy\u2019 (Fig. 2); (b) a hand hygiene exercise, where, following instruction on correct hand washing technique, students\u2019 were assessed on their ability to wash their hands to a satisfactory standard using the \u2018Glitterbug\u2019 (http://www.arrowscientific.com.au/glitterbug.html) hand\u2010washing system [efficient removal of the \u2018GlitterBug\u2019 (fluorescent dye) was determined by ultra\u2010violet light illumination and competency required complete removal of fluorescent dye as determined by a single examiner, using predetermined criteria]; (c) a unit management exercise which assessed students on their ability to (i) decontaminate and set\u2010up a unit prior to treatment of their first patient, and (ii) demonstrate the correct procedure for oiling dental hand pieces (Fig. 3). On discussion with teaching and support staff these areas were selected as procedures that were core to infection control and which all new clinical students needed to master prior to treating patients on clinic. As this competency course assessment evolves the incorporation of other procedures will also be considered (e.g. handling of sharps).",

In addition positive student and staff questionnaire feedback was received which indicated increased student knowledge and application in this area. It is possible that these results were achieved due to increased student understanding of the rationale for compliance with the infection control programme due to the incorporation of additional teaching. It was also notable that significantly more students passed the infection control competency test in the second year of its implementation and that there was also a marked improvement in student performance.

It is also important that routine infection control procedures are adopted for all patients as carriers of latent infection may be unaware of their condition (16, 17) or choose not to inform the dental practitioner. It should also be remembered that it is unethical to refuse dental care to patients with a potentially infectious disease. New pathogens and risk areas constantly emerge, and as a result, infection control recommendations and guidelines are constantly changing to adapt to the new evidence base, so it is essential to have a dynamic and modifiable undergraduate curriculum. Thorough training of our undergraduate dental students in infection control is a necessity and areas that could potentially be perceived as trivial by the student cohort require particular attention. Indeed, hand hygiene may possibly represent one such area. Recent studies have shown hand hygiene to be the single most critical measure for reducing the risk of transmitting organisms (2) between patients and dental staff and in particular for controlling the spread of multi\u2010resistant organisms. Clearly, the aim of hand hygiene procedures is to eliminate transient microflora and reduce resident microflora for the duration of the dental procedure as skin bacteria are capable of rapidly multiplying under surgical gloves if hands are not washed thoroughly with antimicrobial soap (18, 19, 20, 21). It is therefore imperative for students to learn and adhere to high levels of hand hygiene to avoid the potential of pathogens contaminating the operator's hands during dental procedures or entering the oral cavity through torn gloves.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that dental unit waterlines can become colonised with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa which potentially pose an epidemiologic risk (22, 23, 24, 25). Dental hand pieces and other devices can also retain infectious material with the potential to subsequently transmit disease. A recent study of general dental practitioners within the UK found issues relating to instrument decontamination (26). Indeed, recently 4089 patients from a dental clinic in Scotland were contacted due to a dentists admission of periodic use of unsterilised equipment. Subsequently, 1005 patients were screened for HBV, HCV and HIV although the investigation found no evidence of patient\u2010to\u2010patient transmission (27). A separate report however did demonstrate that patient\u2010to\u2010patient transmission of HBV via contaminated instruments has occurred (28).",

In addition, the varied modes of delivery of the teaching of the infection control competency course, including the didactic lecturing, student centred learning and \u2018hands\u2010on\u2019 application, can potentially enhance student interest and facilitate a \u2018deep\u2019 learning approach to the subject (31); however, follow up of subsequent student cohorts will be required to confirm these findings. The limiting of student class size during the infection control competency exercise facilitates student centred teaching, enabling active engagement of the students in the learning process (13). Combined, these approaches should assist a \u2018deep\u2019 rather than a \u2018surface\u2019 learning, enabling subsequent application of knowledge (31, 32). Whilst it is assured that our modified curriculum will continue to guarantee all dental students have a sufficient level of knowledge to enable safe management of patients, it will be of interest to monitor the performance of the student cohorts in the latter years of the dental undergraduate course. Our preliminary data indicates potential improvements in student awareness and application and therefore it is conceivable that these benefits may be apparent in infection control assessment exercises, such as OSCE, and also importantly, during clinical procedures. Indeed it is proposed that further information will be gathered to determine any long\u2010term benefit in infection control performance, as the students progress through the course.",
