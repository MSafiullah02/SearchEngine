Previously, SARS CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Lin, C. W., Lin, K. H., Hsieh, T. H., Shiu, S. Y. et al., FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2006, 46, 375-380) . In this study, proteome analysis of the human promonocyte HL-CZ cells expressing SARS CoV 3CLpro was performed using 2-DE and nanoscale capillary LC/ESI quadrupole-TOF MS. Functional classification of identified up-regulated proteins indicated that protein metabolism and modification, particularly in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, was the main biological process occurring in SARS CoV 3CLpro-expressing cells. Thirty-six percent of identified up-regulated proteins were located in the mitochondria, including apoptosis-inducing factor, ATP synthase beta chain and cytochrome c oxidase. Interestingly, heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (HSP70), which antagonizes apoptosis-inducing factor was shown to down-regulate and had a 5.29-fold decrease. In addition, confocal image analysis has shown release of mitochondrial apoptogenic apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c into the cytosol. Our results revealed that SARS CoV 3CLpro could be considered to induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.

Confocal imaging of the stained cells revealed that the release of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria was found in the SARS CoV 3CLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7A, right) , but not in mock cells (Fig. 7A, left) . In addition, cytochrome c, the other mitochondrial pro-apoptotic protein, was also found to be released from mitochondria to cytosol in 3CLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7B) . The results indicated that SARS CoV 3CLpro induced mitochondria alternations in release of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c, therefore responsible for activation of upstream caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 194, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 517, "end": 526, "text": "(Fig. 7A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 690, "end": 706, "text": "(Fig. 7A, right)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 731, "end": 746, "text": "(Fig. 7A, left)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 909, "end": 918, "text": "(Fig. 7B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Subcellular localization of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c"}, {"text": "In this study, 73 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated proteins in 3CLpro-expressing cells were identified using the combined analysis of 2-DE and Q-TOF MS ( Figs. 1 and 2 , Tables 1 and 2 ). Of the up-regulated proteins identified, 36% (26/73) were mitochondrial proteins that are associated with many biological processes, particularly in electron transport, ATP synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and apoptosis (Fig. 4A , Table 1 ). By contrast, only 19% of down-regulated proteins were located within mitochondrion (Fig. 4B) . Up-regulation of activation of the mitochondrial electron transport system coupled with ATP synthesis was identified in SARS 3CLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3 ), in which ATP synthase (Spot ID 19) and cytochrome c oxidase were also in involved in the control of mitochondrial membrane potential DCm and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [31] . This finding could be associated with generation of ROS in 3CLpro-expressing cells as described in our previous report [16] . Protein metabolism and modification was the major biological process for up-regulated and down-regulated proteins in 3CLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 5) . However, analysis of the biological process indicated that proteolysis and protein modification were significantly up-regulated, but protein biosynthesis and protein complex assembly were downregulated in 3CLpro-expressing cells. Significant increases of Figure 5 . Comparison of biological processes associated with up-regulated and down-regulated proteins in 3CLpro-expressing cells compared with mock cells. Biological bioprocesses associated with up-and down-regulated proteins were classified using Panther Classification system (http://www.pantherdb.org/). Percent of biological process was calculated as the number of identified proteins in the indicated biological process/the number of the total identified proteins6100. the 26S protease regulatory subunit 6A (Spot ID 21) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N (Spot ID 24), which is involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway was demonstrated by sliver staining of 2-DE gels and Western blotting (Figs. 1, 2 and 6 ). Interestingly, up-regulation of proteasome subunits was also found in SARS CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and hepatitis virus B (HBV) HBx-expressing mice [20, 22] . The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a central role in several cellular processes including antigen processing, apoptosis, cell cycle, inflammation, and response to stress [32] , and is involved in the replication of several viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (murine coronavirus) [33, 34] , adenovirus [35] , hepatitis C virus [36] , and human immunodeficiency virus [37] . Therefore, up-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway induced by SARS-CoV 3CLpro protein might be involved in the SARS pathogenesis. Five kinds (C1/C2, A/B, D0, A2/B1 and M) of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) were identified as being significantly up-regulated in SARS-CoV 3CLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 1, Table 1 ), and responsible for transcription, pre-mRNA processing, mRNA splicing, and nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism ( Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). The finding was in agreement with the protein profiling of SARS-CoV-infected cells in a previous report [20] . HnRNP have also been reported to be involved in the replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [38, 39] . In addition, hnRNP A2/B1 and A/B have been demonstrated to interact with the negative-strand MHV leader RNA and to enhance Figure 6 .

Apoptosis-inducing factor (Spot ID 55) was also released from the mitochondria of 3CLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7A) .

Moreover, the other mitochondrial apoptogenic protein cytochrome c has been demonstrated to be released from mitochondria (Fig. 7B) . Since the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 has been demonstrated previously to be involved in 3CLpro-inducing apoptosis [16] , release of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c in the cytosol ise suggested to interact with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and dATP/ATP to activate apoptosomemediated caspase-9 and process downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3.
