Due the rapid dissemination of this respiratory disease, increased deaths and resource depletion, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus as pandemic [1] [2] . This international public health emergency is rapidly mobilizing the government, the industry and the scientific community to respond effectively to this new disease that represents a highrisk for human population and a negative impact for others areas such as economy, education, politics, etc. By April 30, 2020, 3,096,626 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 217,896 deaths were globally reported to World Health Organization (WHO) [3] . On February 29, 2020, the first two cases of Covid-19 were reported in Mexico. By April 30, the total number of infections was 17,799 and 1732 deaths in this North American country [4] . Regarding Mexico City, by April 30, 2020, there have been confirmed 6412 cases and around of 379 persons have died due to the Covid-19 disease [5] .",

In this section some important approaches are summarized. In the works [10] and [11] are presented studies about the power of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate new information collected from Twitter for public health research. Other contributions, such as [12] , demonstrated experimental findings that give rise to future research works on when to use Twitter information for public health. In order to show the effectiveness of use social media information as strategy for public research in [13] and [7] are presented some analysis. Both research papers conclude with a recommendation to combine social media information with other techniques to measure disease surveillance and spread. In [14] is presented a real time system for the prediction and detection of the proliferation of an epidemic by identifying disease tweets by graphical location. A seminal paper published by [15] proposes combining Twitter data with Goolgle Trends data to track the spread of infectious diseases. A study conducted by [16] analyzed Twitter data collected during some infectious disease outbreaks. The experimental findings helped to learn more about how act people with panic disorder into a health contingency. Other interesting proposals are related to applications for surveillance with data source from Twitter. For example: monitor H1N1 pandemic [17] , monitor Dengue in Brazil [18] , monitor Covid-19 symptoms in Bogota, Colombia [19] , and monitor Covid-19 in South American Population [20] .",
