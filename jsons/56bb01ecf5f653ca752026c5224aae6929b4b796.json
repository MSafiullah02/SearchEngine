It can also create tensions within the family unit: fear of illness, unusual promiscuity, fear of a deteriorated economic situation, the need to take care of children's schooling at home while continuing to work from home. These tensions can lead to intra-family violence, of which children are often the first victims and which will be a major risk factor for later psychiatric disorders. ",
