            "text": "Emerging viruses is a term used to describe the appearance of viruses whose presence has increased over the past twenty years or whose presence threatens to increase in the years to come. Emerging viruses include those that have been diagnosed in the civil population as a new or that may have been present before but are now rapidly increasing in their global range [1], [2]. A number of viruses that meet this definition include the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of subtype H5N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, hantavirus, the Middle East respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika, West Nile etc. Diseases caused by emerging viruses threaten human and animal health [1], [2], [3], [4]. Most of emerging viruses are zoonotic. Their appearance is believed to be driven by a number of factors such as socio-economic, environmental and ecological changes [4]. More local interaction with wildlife in undeveloped countries, greater levels of global travel and trade, and different land use have also been identified as contributing factors for their rapid emergence [5]. Such factors, together with a substantial increase of human population over the past five decades, and enormous urbanization in developing countries, have contributed to the increased chance of viral diseases emergence and re-emergence [3]. Virological factors which can increase the transmission potential of emerging human viruses have been analyzed [6].",

Over the past ten years, there have been intermitten outbreaks of a number of emerging and reemerging zoonotic viral diseases in Southeast Asia. Importation of emerging virus infection from this region into Europe [9], Canada [10], Sweden, Denmark and Australia [11] have been reported. The incidence of Nipah virus (NiV) in Malaya from the month of September 1998 to the month of May 1999 resulted in 265 cases and 105 fatalities [12]. In 2001\u20132002, the outbreak of NiV in Malay pig farmers led to several fatalities. Fruit bats are considered to be the reservoir for NiV [13]. Avian influenza is a major public health threat due to its high mortality rate of the disease together with its ability to produce novel forms of influenza virus which can cause pandemics [14]. By 9th May 2016, a total of 850 cases had been reported internationally with 449 fatalities. Of these, the Indonesian archipelago, together with Egypt in Africa, have diagnosed more cases than other countries. The total number of cases diagnosed in Indonesia by the same time was 199, or 23% of the global diagnosed cases. Globally, the mortality rate linked to influenza A H5N1 infection is 53% (449/850). In the Indonesian archipelago the mortality rate is 84% (167/199), while in Egypt it is 33% (116/350) [15]. In addition, major outbreaks of dengue disease were reported in Indonesia in 1998 and 2004 [16]. The circulation of other emerging viruses such as West Nile [17], Chikungunya [18], Zika [19] and coxsackievirus [20] have also been recently reported in Indonesia.",

As of March 11th, 2015, the outbreak had involved 24 282 reported cases and 9 976 reported deaths. As the outbreak was occurring in some of the poorest and least accessible parts of the world, the actual numbers are predicted to be significantly higher [24]. The outbreak is a major health concern in the African Sub-Saharan region. The illness was characterized by fever, severe diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality (30%\u201390%) [25]. The genus Ebolavirus is one of three members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus), along with the genus Marburgvirus and the genus Cuevavirus. The genus Ebolavirus is made up of five distinct species: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus\n[26]. Three ebolavirus species have been recorded which cause substantial outbreaks in the African sub-Saharan region: EBOV, SUDV, B. ebolavirus. Potential sources of Ebola virus are fruit bats of the species Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata. They are found in large areas of West Africa, indicating the likelyhood that the Ebola virus has been circulating silently in this area over a period of time. The incidence of Ebola in Guinea signifies the possibility of EBOV outbreaks in the greater area of West Africa [27].",

Typical outcomes of biological risk assessment are the identification of risks that have to be properly managed as well as the determination of appropriate biosafety levels to be implemented [44]. When working with emerging viruses, there may not be sufficient information to make an informed assessment of biorisk. In early stages of any emerging disease, the level and nature of associated biorisk will be uncertain, and uncertainty causes fear. Laboratory workers are at risk from infection by a disease with novel and frightening properties, for which, there may be unproven treatments or none at all. The level of risk to laboratory workers should be assessed using the best-available information of the emerging viruses such as the route of spread, stability in the environment, presence in various body sites and sample types, and the number of cases likely to be encountered. Risks to laboratory personnels should be reduced to the minimum by the provision of appropriate equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE), procedures, and an adequate level of training [24]. Immediate communication with the scientific community has also been found to be helpful in the biorisk assessment and management of exposure to emerging viruses which do not have approved treatment procedure or any post-exposure prophylaxis treatment [33].",

The mechanism of transmission in nature is not understood. It seems likely that SARS-CoV is transmitted by close personal contact. Airborne transmission of SARS virus has been shown [47], [48]. SARS may also be spread through droplets, aerosols and possibly fomites. The original source of SARS-CoV is not known. SARS-CoV may be detected in the respiratory system, blood, or faeces. The precise transmission mechanism of SARS-CoV-laboratory-acquired infection has yet to be elucidated. Experiments requiring any manipulation of non-inactivated specimens should be undertaken in BSL2 facilities with the application BSL3 practices. All aerosol-generating procedures should be carried out in BSC, and the necessary PPE needs to be worn.

The saliva of infected animals is highly infectious, and biting is the commonest method of transmission. The highest viral concentrations are to be found in the central nervous system (CNS) tissue, salivary glands, and saliva. The most likely sources for infection are accidental parenteral inoculation, cuts, or pricking by needles using contaminated laboratory equipment, biting by infected animals, and exposure of mucous membranes or broken skin to contaminated tissue or fluids. BSL2 and/or animal BSL2 practices and facilities are recommended for all experimentation using known or potentially infectious materials or animals. Vaccination for Rabies is a necessary precaution for all workers prior to experiments on the rabies virus or Rabies-infected animals [45]. Rabies is lethal to humans [49]. However, recovery from the disease by subject not receiving any treatment has been reported [50].",

Laboratory workers are at risk of inhaling the virus from aerosols produced by infected animals or by the aspiration, dispension, mixing, centrifugation or other forms of manipulation of virus-infected samples. Laboratory workers may also be infected directly by inoculation of mucus membranes via virus-contaminated gloves after the handling of tissues, feces or other secretions of infected animals. Work involving HPAI viruses in laboratories requires increased caution because of the likelyhood of infection of laboratory personnels.

The dynamics of accidental infection risk in research laboratories is dominated by infective aerosols and, to a smaller extent, percutaneous infection [28]. Aerosols are suspensions in the air (or other gaseous medium) of solid or liquid particles which are small enough for them to remain airborne for long periods because of their low-settling rate. The sizes at which particles exhibit aerosol behavior also depends on the median diameters at which they become deposited in the lower respiratory tract after inhalation [58], [59]. Four characteristics of virus\u2013host relationship have been proposed to determine aerosol transmission which include the amount of available virus, virus or virus aggregate particle size, level of mucosal inflammation, and efficiency of viral replication in susceptible mucosa [60]. For example, the importance of aerosols in the transmission of influenza virus has been indicated [61], [62].",

SARS-CoV, HPAI H5N1, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus are representative of the emerging viruses assigned to BSL3 facilities. The high containment BSL3 emphasizes additional primary and secondary barriers to reduce or eliminate the release of infectious organisms into the immediate laboratory space and the general outside environment. Additional measures to prevent transmission of viruses are appropriate respiratory protection, HEPA filtration of exhausted laboratory air and strictly controlled laboratory access [45], [70].",

The initial choice of a chemical disinfectant is related to the resistance of the viruses being handled. Enveloped viruses are the most susceptible to chemical disinfection. Nonenveloped viruses are the least susceptible. Consideration needs also be given to practicability, stability and compatibility with materials and the health hazards.

Bioterrorism, and its effects, can impose heavy demands on the public health care system which will be needed to handle the consequences.

This also highlights the complexity of the system that leads to the emergence of viral outbreaks. Emerging viral threats need to be met with deliberative actions such as improved surveillance and outbreak response measures. Speedy identification of emergent of disease-causing viruses is an essential component of any responsive program for control. To successfully control emerging viruses, knowledge of many key aspects of their pathogenicity, molecular characteristics and information on factors causing efficient person-to-person spread, viral immunology and immunogenetics is critical. This is a challenging task, and the roles of the laboratory in diagnosis and research of emerging viruses are indispensable. To be confident in handling pathogenic emerging viruses, it is vital to develop and implement biosafety principles for safe handling of the viruses in the laboratory and preventing laboratory viral exposure and infection. Biosafety programmes should, therefore, be in place. Keys to the biosafety programmes are an assessment process for biorisk and a biorisk management by implementation of containment systems. As emerging viruses might be of dual-use concern, a biosecurity system is also important. Increased capacity in the safe handling of emerging viruses will in turn improve surveillance and strengthen preventive and control procedures. Although a tendency in the emergence of pathogenic viruses is increasing, prediction in this area remains difficult for the occurrence of future viral diseases and the size of the public health burden and economic threats posed. Development and implementation of laboratory biosafety principles is therefore critical as part of a response for preparedness to future outbreaks of emerging viruses.",
