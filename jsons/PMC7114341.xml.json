            "text": "Chikungunya is the most rapidly spreading infectious virus which is resulting in a new threat to the public health globally. It is transmitted into the human body from two types of infected mosquitoes i.e. Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis. This virus can spread in three ways: (1) Infectious female mosquitoes can transmit CHV to healthy humans. (2) Infectious humans can transmit it to healthy female mosquitoes. (3) Infectious female mosquitoes can lay infectious eggs. It was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania. According to World Health Organization, 6,93,489 suspected cases and 37,480 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) regional office. Out of these, 2,65,000 suspected cases were from Brazil, 1700 cases from Kenya and 19,000 were from Bolivia and Colombia respectively [1]. Henceforth, chikungunya remains a threat for the region. CHV has been identified in 60 countries of Africa, Asia, America and Europe. The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to dengue and zika virus which include most common symptoms like high fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, red eyes, nausea and rashes [2]. To differentiate CHV from dengue and zika virus, symptoms based comparison is represented in Table 1\n. In Table 1 \u2018+++\u2019 indicates the major symptoms of dengue, zika and chikungunya virus, \u2018++\u2019 represents the symptoms which are not so major but they are still significant indicators of these viruses, \u2018+\u2019 represents symptoms which are very less frequent and they may or may not appear in person suffering from these viruses and \u2018\u2212\u2019 indicates the symptoms which are absent in the person suffering from corresponding disease.",

The published work has been compared on the basis of 11 important specifications i.e. major contributions, application domain, IoT, cloud computing (CC), fog computing (FC), prediction model (PM), real time perspective (RTP), outbreak role index (ORI), alert generation (AG), security mechanism (SM) and comparison with infectious diseases (CD). These systems have various limitations such as diagnostic tests are not readily available, lack of people involvement in providing vital information about their health and environment conditions, and traditional method to diagnose and monitor proactive diseases. Sometimes, it is not possible for the patient to visit the hospital for routine checkup or doctors cannot monitor each patient regularly by visiting them.

Even, many healthcare applications using mobile technology and context-aware technology are migrated onto the cloud platform, which can provide services remotely in a real time [3]. However, there exist many challenges in these systems such as latency issue, location awareness and transmission of big data. As big data is transmitted over a network, the chance of error is high because data transmission latency and packet dropping possibility are proportional to the volume of transmitted data. In case of emergency, single error in data transmission causes inaccurate diagnosis as well as delay in alerting the user which affects the human life. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the data transmission between mobile end users and cloud servers. Healthcare applications also require immediate analysis of data and real time decision without any delay which is not possible in cloud computing. So, a fog layer is included in between the cloud server and mobile end users. First layer consists of IoT based sensors to generate data for further processing on second layer. Second layer is fog layer to pre-process the data which is generated by IoT devices in first layer for real time decisions. Third layer is the cloud layer for storing and processing the data which cannot be processed by fog layer. Use of fog computing in IoT based healthcare system facilitates various benefits such as effective utilization of resources, quality of service assurance, availability of medical data on time and immediate emergency notification [4]. These major benefits encourage the use of fog as a middle layer between IoT sensors and cloud computing layer to identify CHV infected users and also to generate real time notifications to end users in time.",

The collected data include health data, environmental data, medicinal data, location based data and meteorological data. Data are collected from the wireless hardware devices embedded into the user's body, inside and surrounding places of user. These devices have the capability of sensing and transmitting data in real time. Table 3\nprovides an overview of various sensors to monitor user's health signs and related events. Table 4\ndescribes the sensitivity, selectivity, reliability and dynamic range of each and every sensor in detecting CHV. Value of all these attributes is transmitted to fog layer to classify user as possibly infected or uninfected. The detailed description of dataset is described below:(a)\nHealth data: Health data set comprises of vital signs of user health. This type of dataset includes high fever, joint pain, headache, body pain, red eyes, rashes on the body, nausea, muscle pain and vomiting. Various health sensors are embedded in the user's body to capture such kind of data.(b)\nEnvironmental data: This dataset considers information about users nearby mosquito dense sites and mosquito breeding sites. This information is captured continuously through wireless mosquito sensors which are placed at different locations. Air temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide values around standing water of ponds, lake, dam, river, tube well, refrigerator, cooler, and air conditioner are also measured by sensors to evaluate the environment condition under which the mosquitoes may lay eggs. Sewer quality and water flow rate are also sensed by various sensors embedded at different places of home and surrounding areas.(c)\nMedicinal data: Medicinal data include medication procedure of the user/patient. It comprises of medicine name, medicine form, quality and ingestion time of the medicine which are included in the medication procedure of the user/patient. This data is acquired through RFID tags. Time is trivially annexed by gateway to this dataset.(d)\nLocation data: It includes location of possibly infected users, location of mosquito dense sites and breeding sites. These locations are sensed by Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors to get travel history of each user during CHV infection.(e)\nMeteorological data: It includes climate data such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, amount of rainfall and humidity. These are sensed by various climate sensors.\n",

            "text": "Classification is an important tool for taking decision in various medical diagnoses. This component provides an initial diagnosis to users by classifying them depending upon their CHV attribute values using FCM classifier as possibly infected and uninfected. FCM [23] is the technique of clustering of data in which a dataset is organized into n clusters such that the each data point in the dataset belongs to each cluster to a definite amount of degree. The degree of the belonging or membership of certain data point in the cluster is high when it lies close to the center of that cluster and the degree of the membership is low when it lies far away from the center of a cluster. FCM repeatedly computes the centroids of each cluster and the fuzzy pseudo-partition until the partition does not change with time. A set of ten data points are denoted as Y\n = {Y\n1, Y\n2, Y\n3, Y\n4, Y\n5, Y\n6, Y\n7, Y\n8, Y\n9, Y\n10} where these Y\n1, Y\n2, Y\n3, Y\n4, Y\n5, Y\n6, Y\n7, Y\n8, Y\n9, Y\n10 refer to the attributes i.e. fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, red eyes, skin rash, nausea, sore throat, itching and fatigue. Two fuzzy clusters, S\n1, and S\n2 are subset of all possible fuzzy subsets of Y which are used to classify users by grouping their dataset into two clusters in which one cluster contains uninfected users and second cluster contains possibly infected users. The main objective of FCM is to minimize errors in the objective function. Mathematical form of objective function is shown in Eq. (1).(1)J   (U,   A,   Y)=   \u2211i=12\u2211j=110uij   mdij2(yj,   ai   )\nJ   (U,   A,   Y)=   \u2211i=12\u2211j=110uij   m\u2016yj\u2212   ai\u20162where U is the partition matrix such that U\n = \nu\nij, i\n = 1, 2 and j\n = 1, 2, \u2026, 10. u\nij is the membership value of the jth data to the ith cluster. Y is the set of data points. A is the set of cluster centers A\n = \na\ni. m is the fuzzy strength parameter and is generally chosen as 2 for optimal statistical results. It controls the fuzziness of the system. ||y\nj\n \u2212 \na\ni||2 is the Euclidean distance between data points y\nj and cluster centers a\ni of the ith cluster.

Diagnostic alert message contains diagnosed category of user as possibly infected or uninfected of CHV. If user is classified as possibly infected from CHV, infected user is continuously monitored with various events such as medicinal, environmental, climate and location. In this case, sensitivity factor with respect to time of various events is calculated as:Sensitivity   Factor=P(S(E1\u222aE2\u22ef\u222aEn))where S denotes the user's health category infected as CHV. {E\n1, E\n2, \u2026, E\nn} represents the probability of occurrence of n events in current time. If the sensitivity factor of infected user is greater than predefined threshold then automatically alert is generated to concerned user for taking necessary actions in the direction of wellness. It also provides information about nearby hospitals to the users depending upon the location of user and shares his/her status of infection with nearby doctors to immediately perform test for CHV. Threshold value of each patient is predefined based on the health condition and health history. Otherwise, no alert is generated on user's mobile if sensitivity factor is less than threshold. These alerts are also stored on cloud storage to share with doctors and healthcare professionals during emergency state of the patient. Therefore, sensitivity factor based alert generation enhances the decision making capabilities of doctor in a time sensitive manner and reduces the number of false alert generation.

Tools and techniques of SNA are useful if a social network graph has been created efficiently. So, Algorithm 4 provides step by step computation for creating global SNA graph. In this graph, once user is screened as possibly infected by classification component, his/her travelling locations are traced through GPS enabled mobile phones. These locations are added in the global SNA graph and make edges between these locations and user. It is created and updated on time. Different color schemes are also used for different regions as well as different users while creating SNA graph as shown in Fig. 2\n(a). In SNA graph, red color for infected regions and possibly infected users, green color for uninfected regions and uninfected users, and yellow color for risk prone regions. Infected regions are those regions where one or more individuals are infected. Uninfected regions are those where no one is infected from CHV.

FCM classifier was implemented on an Intel i7 CPU at 2.50 GHz with 4 Gbytes memory using Matlab running on windows 7 using the dataset of 5000 cases. The dataset is first normalized to transform symptoms values accepted in \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 into the interval [0,1] according to the strength of each symptom to avoid numerical difficulties during calculation. The classification accuracy of FCM algorithm is tested with fuzzy strength parameter \u2018m\u2019 which varies in the range [1], [2]. For each choice of \u2018m\u2019, we test the various statistical parameters namely, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recall and error rate. Finally, the one with lowest error rates and the highest accuracy are selected as the optimal fuzzy strength parameter. Table 9\nsummarized the results of classification performance of FCM in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall and error rate. From Table 9, we can see that the results of the classification performance of FCM classifier with different value of \u2018m\u2019 parameter are very close. But highest accuracy is achieved with \u2018m\u2019 = 2. The results show that the system is able to efficiently classify the users into possibly infected or uninfected with high value classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision & recall and low values for error. Fig. 3\nrepresents the comparison of different classification algorithm namely, NN (Neural Network), FKNN (Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors) and NB (Naive Bayes) using different number of cases. The accuracy of classification algorithms is shown in Fig. 3(a) which shows that the FCM based classification algorithm performs better than all other algorithms. Fig. 3(b) shows the classification time of different algorithms using different datasets. Fig. 3(c) represents the classification execution time of FCM classifier with different datasets which are transmitted to health fog rather than being sent to the cloud for processing and analysis. The graphical trend shows that proposed system through health fog computing layer identify category of user as possibly infected or uninfected with less time than directly through cloud computing. It is because fog computing provides various resources such as compute, storage and communication in the close proximity of mobile users as compared to cloud computing. It also avoids unnecessary flow of raw information from mobile end user to cloud server while processing and sharing the information.",

The main aim for statistically analyzing the efficiency of alert generation component is to verify the false positive alerts. These alerts are based on total number of alerts and evaluate alert generation in terms of delay to deliver information to the user and doctor. Delay time is calculated between time to deliver alert about the occurrence of event to user and time at which event occurred. As a comparative model, cloud based alert generation to doctors as well as users are compared with fog based alert generation in terms of response time. Fig. 4\nrepresents the results which are depicting the estimated delay time for both cloud and fog based computing. The results show that real time notification from fog system is far efficient as compared to the notification from cloud with low value of delay during the occurrence of any abnormal or emergency situation. Various other statistical parameters are also considered for this purpose, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, coverage, mean absolute error, root average square error, root relative squared error and relative absolute error. All these results are shown in Table 10\n. Statistical parameters indicate that proposed system is highly accurate and effective as the low value of false positive alerts.

These datasets are transmitted to both proposed system (health fog system and cloud computing system) and other system using only cloud computing technique for comparing the power consumption rate. The comparison results are shown in Fig. 6 which represents the comparison of power consumption rate of both fog computing and cloud computing with respect to different datasets. The trend of graph shows that power consumption is more in case of cloud computing as compared to fog computing. It is because the fog computing provides computation and communication services in the close proximity of end users. It reduces the volume of data transmitted over network which leads to less traffic resulting in low latency rate and ultimately less power consumption. But in case of cloud computing, large amount of data is transmitted to cloud server for processing which leads to higher traffic congestion over network. This has an adverse effect on response time and power consumption rate.",

Due to the advancement in information and communication technology with IoT, fog computing and cloud computing, it is now possible to enhance the level of information acquisition, storage, efficiently diagnose, and provide a global information access to users, doctors and healthcare professionals. In this paper, fog based intelligent system is proposed to accurately diagnose user as possibly infected or uninfected from CHV by using FCM clustering and immediately send diagnostic alerts to user's mobile from fog system. The main feature of this paper is the use of sensitivity factor with respect to time of various events for determining the health severity. On the basis of health severity, emergency alerts are generated for delivering event information to user's mobile on time through fog network. Furthermore, SNA is used to represent the state of outbreak. ORI is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts in due time to uninfected users those are visiting or living in risk prone or infected regions. It will help uninfected residents to take immediate precautions to prevent the outbreak of these viruses and government healthcare agencies to control the problem effectively. The experimental results of proposed system are compared with cloud computing technology. The results reveal that proposed framework achieves bandwidth efficiency, minimum execution time, and minimum delay in generation of real time notifications.",
