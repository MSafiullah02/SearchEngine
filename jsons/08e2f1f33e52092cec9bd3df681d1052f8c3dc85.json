As our understanding of the proteome becomes more complex, demand is rising for rapidly generated antibodies of higher specificity than ever before. It is therefore surprising that few investigators have moved beyond the classical methods of antibody production in their search for new reagents. Despite their long-standing efficacy, recombinant antibody generation technologies such as phage display are still largely the tools of biotechnology companies or research groups with a direct interest in protein engineering. In this chapter, we discuss the inherent limitations of classical polyclonal and monoclonal antibody generation and highlight an attractive alternative: generating high specificity, high affinity recombinant antibodies from alternative immune sources such as chickens, via phage display.",

(4) When an immune response to a human protein is raised in mice, the large regions of sequence similarity between murine and human proteins may lead to a restricted number of immunogenic epitopes. (5) To generate antibodies that crossreact with homologs from multiple species of mammal is particularly tricky, as the common epitopes among mammals are the very ones that are unlikely to provoke a strong immunoglobulin response in the mouse. (6) Tolerance issues can become even harder to circumvent when the protein of interest is from a mouse or rat. Creating \"knockout\" mice, in which the endogenous copy of the gene for the target protein has been disabled, can often break tolerance, but this is a highly laborious and time-consuming process that few laboratories have the resources to undertake.

Display Technologies as an Alternative Source of Specific Antibodies bacteriophage, Smith et al. were able to generate libraries of gene fusions with the key phage coat protein p3. After transformation into E. coli, the viral replication system packaged the genome (and therefore the cloned gene) into a highly stable complex carrying the gene product on the tip of the phage particle, as a fusion protein with p3. By subsequently selecting expressed virions on an immobilized antibody with specificity for a known protein that had been cloned in the phage genome, they were able to show 1,000-fold enrichment of the gene product. This set of experiments showed that \"genotype-to-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defined the basis of all display technologies developed since.",

Phage production is thereby induced, genotype-to-phenotype linkage is created, and the expressed phage particles are interrogated for the presence of useful protein sequences via target binding. This selective step may be performed by simply immobilizing the target protein on, for example, a protein-binding plastic surface such as an ELISA plate, adding phage, and allowing binding to occur via the antibody-p3 fusion proteins. Nonbinding phage are removed by washing the immobilized surface, and the remaining bound phage are eluted. The eluted phage is then reinfected back into a fresh culture of E. coli to retrieve the selected gene sequences. This process is not perfect, however, and two to four rounds of selection/reexpression/ selection are normally performed iteratively to remove all unwanted clones and enrich the binding population from the background of the library. Nonetheless, this process can be spectacularly powerful, massively enriching specific antibodies in a single selection round (8) . Furthermore, the use of multiple forms of the target antigen in sequential selection rounds and the inclusion of competitor proteins can drive the selected pool toward a highly specific set of epitopes.",

By random recombination of V H and V L sequences from human lymphocyte cDNA (9), or, by using degenerate oligonucleotides to create diversity of DNA sequence in the loops associated with target binding (10), several groups have created very large libraries of antibody gene sequences for phage display. These libraries are analogous to the na\u00efve antibody repertoire in an animal, and selecting from them can result in the identification of antibody fragments that exhibit high specificity and occasionally high affinity for the target protein. Several major studies have proven that with appropriate application of this technology, specific antibodies can be raised to proteins, peptides, haptens, and even carbohydrates. In the most exemplary studies, antibodies have been raised with equivalent affinities to those associated with a strong humoral immune response (11) (12) (13) (14) .",

Raats et al. (52) have also illustrated that anti-idiotype scFvs from an immune chicken scFv library were of considerably higher sensitivity than those derived from a human antibody library in the same study. The generation of highly selective scFvs towards the PrP protein, which is highly conserved in mammals, further demonstrates the advantage of the chicken as an immune model, as isolated scFvs were shown to react with murine, ovine, and bovine orthologs of the protein (47) .",

The target proteins of interest are mixed in a single adjuvant preparation and each immunized animal receives all proteins simultaneously. Spleen and bone marrow tissues from the immunized animals are then used to generate relatively small phage display libraries and specific antibodies are derived via selection of the library separately on the individual proteins originally used for immunization (31) . The immunized chickens appear to react to the proteins fully independently, as the phage display libraries generate individual scFv antibody clones that are fully specific by western blot and ELISA, showing no reactivity to their co-immunogens (31, 54) . This approach has major benefits practically and ethically, as it allows the use of a single library to derive high affinity antibodies to a group of proteins of interest. Multiimmunization methods also simultaneously minimize animal use and raise the likelihood of success in generating an immediately useful reagent (31, 54) .",

First, the simplest scenario combines multiple unrelated proteins, which leads to unrelated B-cell responses after immunization. To derive antibodies of greatest specificity during a multitarget immunization of this kind, it is important to ensure that each of the protein immunogens is highly purified and that no closely related proteins are co-immunized into a single animal. Secondly, to derive antibodies that are cross-reactive to orthologs of a conserved protein from multiple species, it is likely to be beneficial, but not necessarily essential, to include each ortholog in the mix of immunogens given to each animal. Iterative selection rounds that change ortholog each time can then be used to bias toward the isolation of cross-reactive antibodies.",

The level of further downstream analysis carried out on positive hits identified during the binding ELISA depends on what the end user requires. Specific binding function may suffice for scFvs that are to be used simply as reagent antibodies for in vitro analysis of samples via ELISA or western blotting.

These thiol groups can then be used to covalently couple the fragment to a thiol-activated surface (63) .
