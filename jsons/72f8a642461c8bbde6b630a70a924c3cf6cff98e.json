These residents are by no means the only victims within the health care system; this virus has claimed the lives of attendings, nurses, and other essential healthcare providers.",

We were taught that the most important thing is to make sure you are safe, your partner is safe, and then worry about the patient. We do not let firefighters run into buildings without the proper equipment; it follows that we should not let doctors and nurses tend to the ill unprotected. When we took the Hippocratic Oath, we agreed to run into a burning building for the sick, but we did not agree to do it naked. Without protecting our healthcare workers, our healthcare system will fail.",

At hospitals across the country, oral-maxillofacial surgery residents and faculty have been redeployed to ICUs to take care of these COVID patients given.

Viral shedding can occur in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients and is greatest in the nasopharyngeal region. Many of these private practice offices do not have the proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to provide care to patients in today's environment. Surgeons are calling every distributor they can think of and ordering masks and gowns whenever possible with many of the major distributors on backorder.",

Andrew Artenstein, the Chief Physician Executive and Chief Academic Officer at Baystate Hospital, recently published a correspondence explaining how he attempted to buy PPE for his hospital. He went with trucks to try to execute the purchase. However, before he could wire the funds, two FBI agents arrived and started to question him. The Department of Homeland Security was trying to redirect the PPE that the hospital was trying to purchase. It took the intervention of their Congressional representative to allow the hospital to keep the PPE 5 .",

OMSs are on the front lines of this battle, both in our private practices and in the hospital settings. Governors and other state officials have called on us to donate our PPE to hospitals, but still expect us to see emergency patients in the private setting to reduce the strain on the emergency system. We must not waste the lessons learned in this crisis. We should use it as an opportunity to become better integrated and recognized as a vital part of our health care system and help strengthen it.",
