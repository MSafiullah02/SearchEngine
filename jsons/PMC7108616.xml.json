A former military physician with \u2018considerable experience of tropical diseases\u2019, including cholera, in 1849 Parkes was elected a special professor of clinical medicine at University College where he was also appointed as a physician.8 He had published at least three works on cholera: \u2018On Asiatic and Algide cholera\u2019, written during his service in India, was published in 1847; \u2018Intestinal discharges in cholera\u2019 and then \u2018Early cases of cholera in London in 1848\u2019. A frequent contributor to the medical journals of the day, he also authored several well-regarded textbooks. And, from 1852 to 1855, he was editor of the then prestigious British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review in which his review of Snow\u2019s work was published.",

Snow was not the only author to propose a waterborne disease.

In a review of the Horsleydown data, for example, \u2018instead of leaving the origin of the first case uncertain\u2019, Parkes writes, Snow assumed without conclusive evidence its source; at Albion Terrace he insisted without proof that cholera \u2018must\u2019 have entered local drainpipes in the water even though other investigators argued different explanations.",

At a 2013 conference celebrating the 200th anniversary of Snow\u2019s birth, I argued the obvious limits of Snow\u2019s work and the appropriateness of his contemporaries\u2019 criticisms and cautions.22 And, too, I argued the falsity of the claims made on Snow\u2019s behalf by modern historians. Snow did not create \u2018show leather\u2019 epidemiology or mapped cartography. He did not create the experimenta cruces. He did not prove cholera was waterborne. Other contemporary researchers\u2014Reverend Henry Whitehead, William Farr,23 John Simon etc.\u2014were more exacting and better epidemiological researchers than Snow. And yet we persist in the modern myth of Snow, a myth born in a 1901 textbook on the Principles of Sanitary Science and Public Health,24 and later expanded in the 1930s25 as a broad truth.26",
