This article used police-recorded open crime data to understand how the frequency of common types of crime changed in 16 large cities across the United States in the early months of 2020. Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of crime in previous years were used to forecast the expected frequency of crime in 2020 in the absence of the pandemic. The forecasts from these models were then compared to the actual frequency of crime during the early months of the pandemic. There were no significant changes in the frequency of serious assaults in public or (contrary to the concerns of policy makers) any change to the frequency of serious assaults in residences. In some cities, there were reductions in residential burglary but little change in non-residential burglary. Thefts of motor vehicles decreased in some cities while there were diverging patterns of thefts from motor vehicles. These results are used to make suggestions for future research into the relationships between the coronavirus pandemic and different crimes.",

This article outlines initial evidence on how crime is changing, using data from a group of large cities in the United States. This evidence is necessarily limited and it will be possible to understand more detail as the pandemic progresses and more data become available. Nevertheless it is likely to be useful to consider the available evidence now, both to help the development of research questions and data collection for further research, and to provide the best-available evidence on a topic of substantial public interest.",

One of the main mechanisms for achieving these goals was 'social distancing' , i.e. reducing person-to-person transfer of the virus by minimizing the circumstances in which people were in close contact with one another (Qualls et al. 2017 ). This was done by closing schools, cancelling public events (including almost all sports and public entertainment) and advising or ordering people to stay home except for essential trips. California became the first to issue a state-wide stay-at-home order on 19 March, with Illinois, New Jersey and New York following over the next 3 days. Thirty-four more states issued similar orders within the following 2 weeks (Mervosh et al. 2020 ), during which time all 50 states had ordered or recommended school closures (Education Week 2020).",

For example, a purse-snatching in a public park requires not only that a purse and a purse-snatcher be in the same place at the same time, but that other park-goers (potential target guardians) do not intervene, that the park authorities (place managers) have not taken steps to create an environment that makes purse-snatching more difficult, and that the offender's girlfriend (a potential offender handler) has not dissuaded them from offending by threatening to end the relationship if they do.",

Fewer people on the street may have meant fewer targets for street robbery, but also fewer guardians. More people in grocery stores may mean more potential shoplifters, but queuing systems and more staff refilling depleted shelves may have led to more-active place management. Social distancing advice to keep 6-feet apart from others may have made pick-pocketing almost impossible, while only having minor effects on other types of crime.

Disasters cause widespread changes to routine activities through deaths, evacuations and disruption of working and leisure patterns, as well as through damage to the physical environment. Lebeau (2002) and Frailing and Harper (2017) found increases in burglaries in the immediate aftermath of hurricanes in the United States, possibly due to more properties being unattended if residents have evacuated or been hospitalized (Leitner and Helbich 2011) . Studies of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina found an increase in homicide, possibly due to the disruption and subsequent informal reorganization of drug markets (Frailing and Harper 2017) . However, Roman et al. (2007) found that violence more generally in New Orleans actually fell after Katrina, before rising to a higher level than before the hurricane. found that violence was broadly stable in other Louisiana parishes hit by the storm. Varano et al. (2010) studied violent and non-violent crime rates in cities that hosted large numbers of Katrina evacuees and found no widespread or pervasive changes. Prelog (2016) , studying associations between crime and the frequency and severity of natural disasters at the county level, found disasters were associated with higher property crime but no change in violence.

This is difficult because so many factors influence how much crime occurs. A number of media outlets have attempted to understand changes in crime during the pandemic by making week-to-week or year-on-year comparisons of weekly or monthly crime counts. However, these comparisons risk drawing false conclusions because they ignore long-term trends (which affect year-on-year comparisons) and seasonal variations (which complicate week to week comparisons). Perhaps most importantly, these comparisons take no account of random variation, even though crime counts over short periods typically show a relatively large amount of statistical noise (Gorr et al. 2003) . For example, on 27 March The Washington Post reported that both burglaries and assaults in New York City had dropped by 18% compared to the previous week (Jacobs and Devlin 2020). But across the 16 cities for which data were available for the current study, the absolute week-to-week change in burglary was greater than 18% in an average of 16 weeks each year between 2016 and 2019 and the absolute change in serious assaults greater than 18% in an average of 20 weeks each year. That apparently newsworthy changes in crime are actually commonplace might help explain why 6 days later on 2 April, the New York Post was able to report that felonies in New York City had increased 12% year-onyear \"despite coronavirus\" (McCarthy, 2020) .",

These forecasts acted as a synthetic comparison group against which to compare the actual frequency of crime during the pandemic. Due to the large number of such comparisons (one for each crime type in each city in each week), some actual frequencies would be expected to be different from the forecast frequency by chance. Controlling for this (for example by adjusting the significance threshold) is not straightforward, since the data are temporally autocorrelated. For the purposes of this analysis, actual crime counts outside the 99% confidence interval (rather than the more conventional 95%) of the forecast crime count were considered to be significantly different to the expected count of crime in the absence of the virus, but only if the actual count was outside the confidence interval for at least two consecutive weeks. While it is not possible to exclude other sources of variation One alternative approach to modelling the influence of an event on the frequency of crime over time is the interrupted time series design, in which the presence of a relationship between the event and crime can be identified using a dummy variable denoting whether a crime count occurred before or after the event. This approach was not used here because the coronavirus pandemic was a slowonset emergency that may have a relationship to crime that changes over time (Frailing and Harper 2017) . Interrupted time series designs are not appropriate in such circumstances because they assume that a clear distinction can be made between crimes occurring before and after the event under study (Kontopantelis et al. 2015) . Such designs also provide only a single overall measure of the relationship between crime and an external event, whereas it is important to be able to identify evolving relationships caused by, for example, people adjusting to a new normal as an emergency unfolds (Varano et al. 2010) .",

The first is that comparing actual crime to expected crime based on a forecasting model assumes that the frequency of crime would (in the absence of coronavirus) have continued to be shaped by the same forces as in previous years. While this will be true in many cases, it is likely that-for some types of crime in some citiesother factors will have lead crime frequency in 2020 to diverge from what might have been expected based on the frequency of crime in previous years. This can be seen, for example, in thefts of vehicles in Chicago, which were below the confidence interval even in late January. This is an inherent limitation of the synthetic comparison approach used in this study, but is likely to be unavoidable in the context of a global pandemic that meant there were no unaffected places to provide comparison data. The MASE values discussed above also show that, despite this limitation, the current approach is likely to be less error-prone than simple month-to-month and similar comparisons.",

This is unsurprising, since although by 1 March there had been 2500 cases of COVID-19 globally, only 30 of those were in the United States (across seven states) and there had been only one US deaths. By the time the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March (World Health Organization 2020), the number of US cases had increased to 1105 in 40 states, while from 22 March onward there were more new cases in the US each day than in any other country. Future researchers should therefore ensure their analytical methods do not conflate data from before and after early March, which might risk masking any effect.",

            "text": "The third general finding from the figures presented below is that no type of crime changed uniformly in all of the cities under study. This should also be unsurprising, since crime is known to be heavily context dependent and the contexts of different cities vary considerably. To give two simple examples, median household income in San Francisco is more than double that in Baltimore, while population density is more than six times higher in Chicago than in Louisville (US Census Bureau 2020). Understanding the context underlying different relationships between coronavirus and crime is likely to be an important question for future researchers in this area. Figure 2 shows that the frequency of assaults in public places was below that estimated by the SARIMA model in five of eight cities, but in no case was the frequency consistently outside the 99% confidence interval of the model. This suggests the observed variation was within what would be expected based on the frequency of serious assaults in previous years. In some cases the confidence intervals are quite wide, reflecting the substantial week-to-week changes in crime frequency mentioned above. Overall, the frequency of serious assaults appears not to have systematically changed during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. This is theoretically unexpected, given the data discussed above showing that the amount of time people spend in public places decreased substantially during the pandemic. This change in people's routine activities might be expected to have led to a decrease in assaults in public, but this does not appear to have happened. Further research into this question may need to explore any changes in who is involved in serious assaults during the pandemic. Since serious violence is known to be concentrated among a small number of persistent offenders and repeat victims (Jennings et al. 2012) , and that offenders who commit serious offences are also more likely to commit minor infractions such as breaching stay-at-home orders (Roach 2018) , it may be that those involved in serious assaults were no less likely to be on the streets during the pandemic than before. Future research should also look at the types of public place in which assaults have occurred: it may be that during the pandemic public assaults were displaced from those facilities seeing fewer people (such as retail malls) to those seeing more (such as parks). In the first weeks of the pandemic there was substantial concern among lawmakers and practitioners that the stay-at-home orders issued by many cities and states would lead to an increase in domestic assaults because victims would be trapped at home with their abusers (Elinson and Chapman 2020; Taub 2020) , with some media reporting that such increases had occurred. For example, in an online news article Tolan (2020) reported that of \"20 large metropolitan police departments that provided data to CNN, nine saw double-digit percentage jumps in domestic violence cases or 911 calls in March, either compared to the previous year or to earlier months in 2020\". Notwithstanding that month-to-month comparisons between February are flawed because March has 11% more days than February, such comparisons ignore that 11 of the departments did not see an increase and month-to-month comparisons take no account of the variability of crime over time. Figure 3 shows that, at least during the early part of the epidemic, concerns of a surge in domestic violence may have been unfounded. The observed frequency of serious assaults in residences (a category not necessarily identical to domestic violence) was above that forecast by the model in five cities and below the model forecast in another three, but in every case the observed frequency was within the confidence interval of the model estimates.",

            "text": "Understanding the nature of domestic abuse from police data is always problematic because many incidents are not reported to police. During lockdowns, this problem may be exacerbated because victims might find it harder to get in touch with those who can help them. For this reason, the present study looked at only serious assaults, which are more likely to be reported than minor assaults. Nevertheless the present result should be treated with caution: as yet there is no evidence of a systematic increase in serious assaults in residences in large US cities, but it is possible that this is due to limitations in the data. The current findings should be validated against survey-based measures of victimization that take longer to become available (and may be impossible to collect during lockdowns). Figure 4 shows the frequency of residential burglaries across 11 cities. The frequency of burglary is below the model estimate in eight cities, although in five of those it remains within the 99% confidence interval. In Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis the frequency of burglary decreased below the lower confidence interval, with the frequency around half of what was forecast. In Chicago and Los Angeles, these reductions began during the week in which schools closed and stay-at-home orders were issued in those cities and were sustained each week afterwards. This means that, for example, in the 4 weeks after a stay-at-home order was issued in Chicago, there were approximately 940 fewer residential burglaries than would have been expected based on the model forecast. This is consistent with the routine activities approach, since stay-at-home orders mean people are more likely to be at home and so able to act as guardians of their property.",

            "text": "Not all cities saw a decrease in residential burglary. For example, burglary in Austin, Louisville and Minneapolis has largely tracked the forecasts produced by the respective models. The inconsistency of these trends across different cities is likely to be an important issue to explore in later research that can make use of more extensive data. Figure 5 shows the frequency of non-residential burglaries. In ten of 11 cities, non-residential burglary was higher after lockdown measures began than forecast, but in only one (Minneapolis) was the difference significant. This lack of a consistent increase may be theoretically unexpected, since the closure of many businesses and the increased number of people working from home might be expected to have decreased guardianship around many non-residential buildings. Further research into this area might usefully disaggregate non-residential burglary into different types of premises. It may be that non-residential burglary is particularly concentrated at establishments (such as pharmacies and liquor stores) that remained open throughout the lockdown period and so had the same levels of guardianship as previously. Figure 6 shows that the frequency of thefts of motor vehicles had divergent patterns across cities. In Austin and Los Angeles, vehicle theft increased significantly in the weeks after lockdowns began, while in another seven there were smaller increases that remained within the confidence interval. Conversely, in Chicago and Tucson vehicle theft decreased significantly. Figure 7 shows the frequency of thefts from vehicles, which decreased in eight cities, in three of them significantly. Some of these decreases were particularly large: between 9 March and 27 April there were around 2520 (62%) fewer thefts from motor vehicles in San Francisco than forecast by the SARIMA model, and 870 (17%) fewer than forecast in Los Angeles.",

Studying crime as an undifferentiated whole is almost always inadvisable (Cornish and Smith 2012) but the clear differences between crime types seen here suggest researchers should consider individual types disaggregated by location and victim type. Similarly, the differences seen across cities highlight the importance of studying the relationships between COVID-19 and different crime types in multiple settings. Much criminological research draws conclusions based on data from only one city (Ashby 2019), but obtaining a robust understanding of any relationships in the present case-and of the limitations of those relationships-is likely to require data from multiple cities or other areas. While the present study was able to access data only from large cities in the United States, future studies should analyse these research questions across countries, as well as in suburban and rural areas.",
