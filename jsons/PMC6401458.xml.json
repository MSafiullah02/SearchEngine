            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was originally isolated as a novel coronavirus from a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure in 2012 (1). A human receptor for the virus, called human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), was identified subsequently (2). Many epidemiological and virological investigations have been undertaken since then; however, information about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is limited. In addition, because MERS-CoV is endemic in the Middle East, the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment strategies remains a high priority. Therefore, appropriate animal models are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and facilitate development of effective vaccines and drugs. Some research groups experimentally infected nonhuman primates and small experimental animals with MERS-CoV (3\u20137). Rhesus macaques appear to develop a transient lower respiratory tract infection after a combination of intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal inoculation with MERS-CoV (3), whereas the common marmoset develops progressive and severe pneumonia, which can be lethal (4). However, animal models based on nonhuman primates present both ethical and economic problems. Thus, establishing a small-animal model of MERS-CoV infection is desirable. Unfortunately, MERS-CoV does not infect or replicate in small rodents such as Syrian hamsters (8), mice (9), or rats (10) because they lack a functional MERS-CoV receptor. Zhao et al. described lung infection in a mouse model transduced with an adenovirus expressing hDPP4 (11); thus, a transgenic (Tg) mouse carrying hDPP4 should be suitable for MERS-CoV studies (5). Some research groups developed Tg mice overexpressing the hDPP4 receptor under the control of CAG or cytokeratin 18 promoters (5\u20137). These mice developed severe lung disease, along with infection of the brain. Autopsy data are available from only one MERS patient; therefore, it is unclear whether MERS-CoV causes a systemic infection although there is no evidence that MERS-CoV infects the human brain. Other studies describe development of an hDPP4 knock-in mouse (12\u201314). Although the tissue distribution and expression levels of hDPP4 in these models are largely equivalent to those of DPP4 in wild-type mice, the phenotype that determines MERS-CoV susceptibility varies from model to model. The hDPP4 knock-in mouse model described by Coleman et al. (12) succumbed to infection with wild-type MERS-CoV. In contrast, model mice described by Cockrell et al. (14) and Li et al. (13) are susceptible to infection by serially passaged MERS-CoV, which induces severe lung pathology and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). These mice would be good models for studying pathogenesis of MERS. Here, we developed a new Tg mouse model expressing hDPP4 under the control of its endogenous promoter to better mimic physiological expression of hDPP4. These Tg mice were then backcrossed onto Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice. After evaluating susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection, we investigated age-dependent differences in disease pathogenesis because older age is one of the common factors related to MERS severity and mortality (15\u201320). Both young and adult Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV showed transient weight loss along with moderate pneumonia and MERS-CoV replication in the lung; however, they did not recapitulate the severe disease and lethal infection seen in humans. Young and adult Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV did, however, show different immunopathologies. Adult Tg mice showed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine- and chemokine-mediated macrophage infiltration of the lungs than young Tg mice. Taken together, these results suggest that age affects the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection in Tg mice. The data suggest that other factors are required to recapitulate severe human disease in these Tg mice; however, this mouse model will be useful for identifying host mediators that protect against MERS-CoV infection. This animal model will provide new insight into factors that cause severe MERS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "To generate Tg mice showing tissue- or cell-type-specific hDPP4 expression mimicking that in humans, we first looked at research involving Tg mice harboring human enterovirus receptors (such as the human poliovirus receptor) and SCARB2 receptor-driven endogenous promoters (21, 22). Promoter sequences, which normally include a transcriptional start site, are usually isolated from the upstream regions of endogenous mammalian genes (23). Therefore, we used a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone (RP11-345J9) containing the complete hDPP4 gene and an endogenous promoter to generate Tg mice harboring hDPP4 (Fig. 1A). To screen the Tg mice generated, we confirmed presence of the transgene by PCR genotyping using two primers sets specific for hDPP4 (Table 1, exons 3 and 10). hDPP4 is a protease expressed on the surface of cells in various organs, including T cells (24, 25). The enzyme is expressed by approximately 60% of resting T cells isolated from blood (26). Since handling of peripheral blood in a laboratory is relatively simple, we conducted flow cytometry analysis using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD26/hDPP4 monoclonal antibody that does no react with murine DPP4 to detect expression of hDPP4 in mice. CD3-positive lymphocytes from 2/15 tested pups were positive for hDPP4. These mice were then crossed with C57BL/6 mice to establish two independent Tg lines (Tg1 and Tg2), which were maintained as hemizygotes carrying the hDPP4 gene. The Tg animals were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and were outwardly indistinguishable from control littermates. Because CD3-positive lymphocytes from peripheral blood of line Tg2 showed higher hDPP4 expression than those from line Tg1 (Fig. 1B), Tg2 was used for further analyses. PCR genotyping using primer sets specific for hDPP4 revealed that the complete hDPP4 gene had integrated into the genome of Tg2 mice (Fig. 1C and Table 1).",

While hDPP4 expression was undetectable in brain tissue by Western blot analysis, IHC revealed that endothelial cells lining blood vessels and leptomeninges of the human brain were positive for hDPP4 although neurons and glia were negative. In Tg2 mice, pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells in the lungs, bile capillaries in the liver, the renal tubular epithelium, and the surface of epithelial cells in the small intestine were positive for hDPP4 (Fig. 2B). In addition, several types of endothelial cells and serous membranes in all tested tissues, including the central nervous system, from Tg2 mice were positive for hDPP4. Notably, most lymphocytes in the T cell zones of the spleen and lymph nodes from Tg2 mice were positive for hDPP4. Staining of tissues from non-Tg mice was very weak or absent (except for the small intestine) (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the pattern of hDPP4 expression in Tg2 mice is similar to that in humans (except for pancreas and lymphoid tissues).",

To assess innate immune responses in the lungs of Tg2, non-Tg, and C57BL/6 mice, all animals received intranasal administration of PBS with or without poly(I\u00b7C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (Fig. 3). There was no statistically significant difference in cytokine expression levels between Tg2, non-Tg, and C57BL/6 mice at 24 h after inoculation with poly(I\u00b7C) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Fig. 3). However, when we set expression levels after PBS treatment as 1, we noted that expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-12, and IL-2 in poly(I\u00b7C)-treated Tg2 mice was 0.8- to 2-fold higher than in the other two strains. These results suggest that hDPP4 expression in mice does not have a marked effect on basal innate immune responses in the three mouse strains; however, Tg2 mice show slightly stronger or earlier innate immune responses than C57BL/6 mice and non-Tg mice. Thus, when we investigated immune responses in this animal model, we made comparisons between MERS-CoV-infected and noninfected Tg mice.",

The nasal wash fluid from three out of four Tg2 mice contained barely detectable levels of infectious virus at days 1 and 5 p.i. (Fig. 4C).

The viral titers in lung wash fluid and supernatants of lung tissue homogenates (20%) from Tg2 mice contained 102.3 TCID50/ml and 104.6 TCID50/g, respectively, at 1 day p.i.; these values were significantly higher than those at 6 h p.i. (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively; one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]). The virus titers in the lungs were detectable up until 5 days p.i. Virus was undetectable in the respiratory tract at 7 days p.i. Although IHC revealed that various organs from Tg2 mice were positive for the hDPP4 antigen (Fig. 2B), no infectious virus was detected in the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, intestines, and brain up to 7 days p.i.

            "text": "MERS-CoV infection of the nasal cavity, lungs, brain, spinal cord, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and gastrointestinal tract of Tg2 mice was examined histopathologically on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 35 p.i (n = 3; one or two females and one or two males per time point). Histopathological investigations revealed that Tg2 mice showed progressive pulmonary inflammation associated with acute virus infection, from which they recovered (Fig. 5). On day 1 p.i., there was no obvious infiltration of the lungs in Tg2 mice; however, mild cellular degeneration and viral antigen-positive cells were seen in the bronchioles and a few alveolar areas (Fig. 5A to C). Double-immunofluorescence staining revealed that MERS-CoV antigen colocalized with hDPP4-positive bronchioles and alveolar cells on day 1 p.i. (Fig. 6). On days 3 and 5 p.i., inflammatory reactions, including partial and/or mild perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltration by mononuclear cells and eosinophils in response to viral antigens, were observed in alveolar areas of lung tissue from Tg2 mice (Fig. 5D to I). From day 3 p.i. onwards, the alveolar area was the main site of inflammatory responses to viral replication (Fig. 5F, I, and L). On day 7 p.i., the point at which Tg2 mice showed weight loss, there was evidence of severe lung inflammation, including perivascular and alveolar septal thickening, caused by infiltrating mononuclear cells; some alveoli were positive for viral antigens (Fig. 5K). At day 14 p.i., focal cellular infiltration was still evident in the peribronchioles and alveolar septa although viral antigens and inflammatory responses had cleared from the lungs by day 35 p.i. (Fig. 5M to P). There was no evidence of diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs up to day 35 p.i. These findings suggest that progressive immunopathology occurred uniformly throughout the lungs but resolved within 14 days after infection. Neither histopathology nor IHC detected inflammatory infiltration or viral antigens in the nasal cavity through 35 days p.i. In addition, there was no inflammation or viral antigen expression in the brain through 35 days p.i. (Fig. 7). In contrast, C57BL/6 mice showed no histopathological changes or viral antigen in any organ, including the lung. These results indicate that Tg2 mice suffer acute pneumonia after infection of the lungs with MERS-CoV, which is related to expression of hDPP4 in the bronchiolar epithelium and pneumocytes. Splenocytes from Tg2 mice were susceptible to ex vivo infection with MERS-CoV (Fig. 4D); however, the spleen and other lymphoid tissues did not harbor viral antigens. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced T cell apoptosis upon infection in vitro (28), whereas immunohistochemical staining detected no evidence of apoptosis in lymphoid tissues, including spleen and lymph nodes, of MERS-CoV-infected Tg2 mice. Similar to findings in the other mouse models in which mouse DPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 (12), MERS-CoV replication and pathology were localized in the lungs in Tg2 mice.",

Therefore, we infected 25-week-old mice with MERS-CoV. Tg2 mice showed significant weight loss from days 7 and 8 p.i. before recovering by day 14 p.i. (Tg2 mice, n = 6 [one female and five males]; non-Tg mice, n = 7 [three females and four males]) (Fig. 8A). However, 25-week-old Tg2 mice showed no obvious clinical signs (such as respiratory illness and mortality). The 25-week-old Tg2 mice had seroconverted by 35 days p.i., whereas the C57BL/6 mice had not (Fig. 8B). Next, we examined viral replication kinetics and sites of viral replication in 25-week-old Tg2 and non-Tg mice (n = 4; two females and two males per time point). The nasal wash fluid from one out of four Tg2 mice contained barely detectable levels of infectious virus at 1, 3, and 5 days p.i. (Fig. 8C). Supernatants from maxilla tissue homogenates (20%) from Tg2 mice contained 101.7 and 102.0 TCID50/g at 1 and 3 days p.i., respectively, although the titer was undetectable at 5 days p.i. The viral titers in lung wash fluid from Tg2 mice were detectable up until 3 days p.i., while the supernatants from lung tissue homogenates (20%) from Tg2 mice showed a high viral load from 1 to 5 days p.i.; infectious virus was detectable up until 7 days p.i. Viral loads in the respiratory tract peaked at 3 days p.i. Although no virus was detectable in the respiratory tract of 10-week-old Tg mice at 7 days p.i., infectious virus was detected in the lungs of 25-week-old Tg mice up until 5 days p.i. In addition, infectious virus was detected in the lungs of one of four 25-week-old Tg mice (102.5 TCID50/g) even at 7 days p.i. We also found that viral titers in the nasal wash fluid, maxilla (including nostril), lung wash fluid, and lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice on day 3 p.i. (102.6 TCID50/ml, 103.3 TCID50/ml, 102.3 TCID50/ml, and 104.9 TCID50/ml, respectively) were slightly higher than those in 10-week-old Tg2 mice (101.6 TCID50/ml, 102.9 TCID50/ml, 101.8 TCID50/ml, and 104.5 TCID50/ml, respectively) (P = 0.04, Student's t test with Welch\u2019s correction).",

Therefore, we measured the levels of 20 cytokines and chemokines in lung samples from both 10-week-old and 25-week-old Tg2 mice inoculated with either MERS-CoV or minimal essential medium (MEM). Measurements were made at 6 h and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days p.i. (n = 3 to 4 [2 females and 1 to 2 males per time point] and n = 4 [2 females and 2 males per time point]) (Fig. 11A and B, for 10-week-old and 25-week-old mice, respectively). On day 3 p.i., we observed early expression of gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3)-induced protein 10 (IP-10) in the lungs of both 10- and 25-week-old Tg2 mice, a level which was significantly higher than that in control mice; this increase lasted through day 7. This was followed by a transient increase in expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-13, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in lungs from both 10- and 25-week-old Tg2 mice at day 5 p.i. High levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) and monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG) were detected in the lungs of both groups of Tg2 mice from days 3 or 5 to 7 p.i., whereas IL-12 levels increased at day 7 p.i. IFN-\u03b3 production in the lungs of 10-week-old Tg2 mice peaked significantly on day 5 p.i. while high values were seen in both infected and noninfected 25-week-old mice during the observation period. In contrast, expression of IP-10, IL-12, and IL-1\u03b2 in 25-week-old Tg mice was higher than that in 10-week-old Tg2 mice. Interestingly, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-17 were detected only in 25-week-old Tg2 mice infected with MERS-CoV. IL-1\u03b1, a potent proinflammatory cytokine associated with inflammation and fever, was detected from 3 days p.i. and remained significantly elevated until 7 days p.i.; IL-17 (a proinflammatory cytokine that recruits monocytes and neutrophils) was detected from 3 days p.i. and peaked at 5 days p.i. before falling at 7 days p.i. These results indicate that MERS-CoV infection induces production of acute inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in the lungs. In addition, aging causes more severe immunopathology; this means that young and adult Tg mice show different pathologies in the lung after MERS-CoV infection.",

We did not find any evidence of IFN-\u03b14 or IFN-\u03b2 in the lungs from 10-week-old Tg2 mice at early times postinfection; however, we observed a transient increase in IFN-\u03b14 expression in the lungs of two out of four Tg2 mice at 5 days p.i.; this level fell by 7 days p.i. (Fig. 11C). Day 5 p.i. was the time point at which the amount of virus in the lungs of Tg2 mice began to fall. No IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was detectable in lung samples from either group. On the other hand, the lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice showed a transient increase in IFN-\u03b14 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression at 3 days p.i. (Fig. 11C). In addition, IFN-\u03b14 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression was higher than that in 10-week-old Tg2 mice. Taken together, these results indicate that both type I and type II IFN contribute to the immunopathology of the lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice infected with MERS-CoV.",

This mouse model also shows susceptibility to infection by MERS-CoV; this mimics the nonlethal observations in other mouse models (13, 14). After intranasal inoculation with a human isolate of MERS-CoV, the Tg mice developed acute and mild interstitial pneumonia; however, the infection was nonlethal and so did not mimic severe cases seen in human MERS-CoV patients. MERS-CoV infection can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, although a large number of MERS-CoV infections follow a mild or asymptomatic course in healthy individuals (32\u201335). Thus, this Tg mouse model reflects the natural course of a mild MERS-CoV infection.",

However, none of the infected Tg2 mice had a severe outcome, such as respiratory distress, that led to death. Epidemiologically, patients with diabetes, kidney failure, or chronic lung disease, all of which might weaken the immune system, tend to have a poor outcome after infection by MERS-CoV (http://www.who.int/csr/don/23-september-2015-mers-kuwait/en/).

When we asked why the Tg2 mice showed nonlethal responses to infection, we could not ignore the fact that virus levels in lungs were lower than those reported for other MERS mouse models (5, 12, 13, 38, 39). One reason for this is that the transgene used in this study is a hemizygote, meaning that the copy number or expression level may be lower than that in mice homozygous for hDPP4. In addition, the DPP4 protein is active as a dimer (40), but the Tg2 mice harbor both murine and hDPP4. We presume that the viral yield in the lungs of Tg2 mice was low because of heterodimers formed by hDPP4 and murine DPP4. To address this, we constructed structural models of homo- and heterodimers comprising human and mouse DPP4. Notably, the estimated interaction energy of the DPP4 heterodimers was greater than that of murine and hDPP4 homodimers (\u2212358.2, \u2212347.6, and \u2212344.6 kcal/mol, respectively). These results suggest that DPP4 heterodimers are as stable as DPP4 homodimers. Cockrell et al. reported that mouse DPP4 does not support MERS-CoV entry (38). Thus, the presence of stable DPP4 heterodimers may be a reason for the lower levels of infection in our mouse model. Further study is necessary to clarify this.",

            "text": "Histopathological analysis identified CD3-positive T cells and Iba-1-positive macrophages in the lungs of Tg2 mice on day 7 p.i., which correlated with expression of inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. Tg2 mice aged 10 and 25 weeks showed increased expression of cytokines and chemokines associated with migration of T cells and activation of macrophages, including IP-10, IL-6, IL-13, MCP-1, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, MIG, and IL-12, in the lungs at day 5 and/or 7 p.i. This result is the same as that observed in a hDPP4 knock-in mouse model reported by Coleman et al. (12). In this hDPP4 knock-in mouse model, CD8+ T cells and macrophages affected the course of MERS-CoV-induced disease (12). In addition, Tg2 mice expressed mRNA encoding the type I IFN, IFN-\u03b14, during the early phase of the MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, the pathogenic and immune response data from the knock-in mouse model and our own model are similar. Thus, an acute inflammatory reaction (including production of type I and type II IFNs) and infiltration by macrophages might clear the virus from the lung, thereby preventing progression to MERS. Interestingly, we detected IL-1\u03b1 and IL-17 in the lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice, but not those of 10-week-old Tg2 mice, after MERS-CoV infection. Both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-17 are proinflammatory cytokines that attract monocytes and neutrophils; therefore, they may exacerbate immunopathology after infection. These findings support the notion that the severity of MERS-CoV infection is age dependent. Age is one of the most common factors related to severity and mortality of MERS infection; however, the underlying pathology is unclear (47).",

Indeed, elevated serum levels of IL-6, IL-12, IP-10, and IFN-\u03b3 are observed in patients during the early period after severe infection (48\u201351). In addition, a prominent proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 response, including production of IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-15, and IL-17, is seen in patients during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection (52). In contrast, we found that administration of poly(I\u00b7C) to Tg2 mice induced a mild increase (or earlier induction) in innate immune responses compared with those in C57BL/6 mice and non-Tg mice. This suggests that overexpression of hDPP4 might influence immune responses in Tg2 mice. Thus, we must exercise caution when assessing the relationship between immunopathology and outcome in patients and animal models of MERS-CoV; however, proinflammatory responses seem to contribute to immunopathology during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection in both patients and mouse models.",

While this Tg mouse has limitations as a model for human MERS (i.e., lower virus titer in the lungs and mild disease), the immunopathology seems to resemble a mild and early stage of infection in humans. Even though it has limitations, this Tg mouse model will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying MERS-CoV infection. Indeed, we recently used this mouse model to confirm a role for transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) during MERS-CoV infection (53). This animal model may provide new insight into disease pathogenesis and guide development of therapeutic interventions that mitigate MERS.",
