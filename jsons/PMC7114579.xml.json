During the past decade efforts have been made to develop infection control capacity within healthcare facilities and promote safety for both patients and HCWs. However, healthcare facilities play a critical role for the spread of several emerging or re-emerging highly infectious diseases (HIDs), including viral haemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A H1N1, and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 The European Network for Infectious Diseases defines HID as infectious disease easily transmitted from person to person, causing life-threatening disease, presenting a serious hazard in healthcare settings and in the community, and requiring specific control measures.8 Many HIDs spread rapidly within closed settings if they are not suspected promptly or infection control measures are poorly implemented.9\n",

EuroNHID is coordinated by the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u2018Lazzaro Spallanzani\u2019 (Rome, Italy). During 2009 field surveys were conducted in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries to assess resources and capabilities for the safe and effective management of HID patients, including infrastructure, human resources, equipment, and infection control procedures. Data are now presented from these surveys on hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, management of waste, and recommended optimum and minimum requirements for these issues.",

Most participants were clinicians working in high level isolation units or other isolation facilities designated for referral of patients with HIDs, having backgrounds in infectious diseases, intensive care, infection control, pulmonary medicine, occupational health, or public health. In order to survey only isolation facilities identified by national health authorities for the referral and management of HIDs, we asked partners to provide official documents in which these hospitals are designated as such. This process led to the identification of 48 facilities (Figure 1\n), which represent the centres identified in all participating countries except Spain, where only Catalonian centres were identified.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study detailing the implementation of infection control measures in isolation facilities dedicated to the care for patients with HIDs in Europe. This study included a large number of isolation facilities from several European countries. The checklists for the standardized collection of data are now available to hospital administrators and health authorities for internal or external surveys of other isolation facilities. The checklists may also assist countries to assess their level of preparedness for infectious public health threats, to identify safety issues for patients and HCWs, to prioritize interventions and to monitor their implementation.",

A significant proportion of the surveyed isolation facilities had structural or procedural deficits in their arrangements for hand hygiene. Routine hygiene and disinfection was adequate in the isolation areas of most of the surveyed facilities, but these procedures were often inadequate, particularly as regards final disinfection or safe handling of non-disposable objects, in other areas where the HID patients may stay or pass through, such as diagnostic and emergency departments. Another serious safety issue was identified, in that less than half of the surveyed facilities had established training of housekeeping personnel in procedures for infection control and personal protective equipment. This is vitally important, since the risk for acquisition of a HID is real during housekeeping procedures.20 Housekeeping personnel are often not permanent and their basic training may not include the management of HIDs.",

In two-thirds of the facilities, procedures for the management of solid waste were in place but the decontamination was performed outside the facility. This is considered a partially adequate solution by EuroNHID, because it implies risks during the management, packaging and transportation of contaminated material. The solution suggested as optimal \u2013 decontamination by autoclaving within the facility \u2013 was not available in most facilities. The management of liquid waste was generally more satisfactory, although several facilities lacked decontamination procedures for liquid waste, with possible environmental consequences. Some isolation facilities had no established procedures for solid or liquid waste management. Such variations may be attributed partly to different legal requirements for waste management across Europe, partly to differences in experiences with HIDs, and partly to national economic differences.",

Most of the data were therefore collected before the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The experience gained during the pandemic may have caused modifications and improvements of procedures and capacities that are not reflected in our data. Furthermore, the study's focus on isolation facilities facing HIDs limits its applicability to this setting. Facilities facing HIDs may put more emphasis on isolation and infection control issues than ordinary hospitals but the latter may also have to manage HIDs. Data were also collected on the availability of procedures, but no assessment was made of how appropriate these procedures were nor the level of compliance. The recommendations for adequate management also have limitations. Because of the infrequency of suspected and confirmed HIDs, no high-quality studies exist. Consequently, the recommendations are not evidence-based and no ranking of recommendations is possible. The inadequacy of infection control procedures was particularly evident during the 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, when hospitals played a central role in the dissemination of both infections.3, 4, 5, 6 Our recommendations are therefore based on experience reported in the literature or revealed during this study, and on the partners' expert opinion. Consensus recommendations for biocontainment patient care units specifically designed to care for patients with serious communicable diseases have also been issued in the USA.21 Generally, written procedures and protocols facilitate the management of HID cases and ensure safety during medical practice. Such protocols should ideally be syndrome-specific (e.g. viral haemorrhagic fever) or pathogen-specific (e.g. smallpox) and specify the appropriate procedures and techniques in detail.",
