Corticosteroid treatment effect on outcome was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for major variables (age, SpO 2 /FiO 2 , and lymphocytes) associated with mortality; individual propensity score was incorporated as a covariable to calculate the propensity-adjusted odds ratio (OR) [5] . PSM generated propensity score-matched pairs without replacement, and survival probability was compared by the Kaplan-Meier curve and analyzed with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. For unadjusted comparisons, a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

All patients were given antiviral therapy (e.g., oseltamivir, arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, ganciclovir, interferon-\u03b1), and 151 (62%) were given adjuvant corticosteroid treatment (median hydrocortisoneequivalent dosage 200 [range 100-800] mg/day). Five (5.4%) and 79 (52.3%) patients died in non-steroid and steroid groups, respectively. The median (IQR) administration duration of corticosteroid treatment was 8 (4-12) days. Multiple organ dysfunctions were more common in the steroid group than in the nonsteroid group. Multivariate analysis that adjusted for major mortality-associated variables and propensity score indicated that corticosteroid treatment was independent from overall mortality (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.15-7.46). One hundred forty-seven (60%) had dyspnea and 87 (36%) had ARDS, and subgroup analyses revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with 28-day mortality (both, P > 0.3). Sixty-two patients in 31 pairs were matched (Table 1) , and 28-day mortality rate was 39% in case subjects and 16% in control subjects (P = 0.09). Likewise, addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard antiviral treatment was not associated with 28-day mortality (P = 0.17; Fig. 1 ).

We acknowledged limitations. First, we did not distinguish patients who received corticosteroids for underlying disease (e.g., COPD), the number of which was however small. Second, PSM is limited by adjusting for observed covariables only; randomized placebo-controlled trials are therefore warranted. Altogether, our investigation indicated limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Given the adverse effects, corticosteroid therapy must be commenced with caution, and prudent dosage should be promoted under certain circumstances. ",
