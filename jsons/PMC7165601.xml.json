            "text": "Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick\u2010borne disease caused by the CCHF virus (CCHFV). CCHFV was characterized during the Crimean outbreak in 1944 and later that the same agent was the cause of disease in the Congo in 1956 (Casals, 1969). A member of the Orthonairovirus genus within the Nairoviridae family, CCHFV is primarily transmitted through direct contact of skin or mucous membranes with infectious blood or tissues, by the bite of infected Hyalomma species ticks or contact with viremic livestock (Vorou, Pierroutsakos, & Maltezou, 2007). Furthermore, fatal nosocomial spread of CCHFV in the hospital setting is very common (Oestereich et al., 2014). Upon infection, CCHF progresses through four stages of disease: incubation, pre\u2010haemorrhagic, haemorrhagic and convalescence. The duration of the incubation stage is usually 1\u20133 days when CCHFV is transmitted via tick bite and 5\u201313 days when transmitted via contact with infected blood or tissues. The pre\u2010haemorrhagic stage follows, with non\u2010specific viral symptoms such as fever, muscle soreness, chills, photophobia, headache and nausea. In non\u2010severe cases, individuals clear the infection and the pre\u2010haemorrhagic stage associated symptoms resolve. In severe cases, the disease progresses to the haemorrhagic stage occurs 3\u20136 days after infection, with symptoms such as petechiae and haemorrhaging of internal organs, gastrointestinal system, gums and nose (Shayan, Bokaean, Shahrivar, & Chinikar, 2015). Fatal cases are usually a result of multiple organ failure. The fatality rate of CCHF has ranged from 9% to 50% in past outbreaks (Dilber et al., 2010). Those who survive the haemorrhagic stage experience the convalescent phase, which is characterized by memory loss, headache, dizziness, weak pulse, hair loss, anorexia and vision abnormalities (Shayan et al., 2015). Long\u2010term sequelae, such as neurological problems and impaired vision, have been documented; however, these are rarely permanent (Hoogstraal, 1979). To date, it is still unclear whether survivors develop immunity to subsequent CCHFV infections, but IgG responses lacking in fatal cases are induced in non\u2010fatal cases in humans (Ergonul, Tuncbilek, Baykam, Celikbas, & Dokuzoguz, 2006).",

However, most documented CCHF cases have been reported in Turkey. CCHFV remains a risk group\u20104 pathogen for its ability to cause severe to fatal disease in humans and the absence of effective options for pre\u2010 or post\u2010exposure prophylaxis. Under these circumstances, CCHFV is still deemed a possible weapon for bioterrorism (Bronze, Huycke, Machado, Voskuhl, & Greenfield, 2002). In this review, we explore the past, summarizing historical measures of CCHFV control and prevention. We then review the present state of existing animal models to evaluate therapeutics and interventions tested in human cases of CCHFV infection. Finally, we discuss investigational drugs in pre\u2010clinical studies. This review aimed to highlight the importance of developing an animal model for CCHF that recapitulates hallmarks of human disease in order to optimize pre\u2010clinical drug testing and thereby improve our chances in developing an effective medical countermeasure for humans.",

It remains difficult to control CCHFV by culling domestics animal hosts because reservoirs, such as cattle, goats and sheep, often remain asymptomatic even when highly viremic (Whitehouse, 2004). As many nosocomial outbreaks of CCHFV have occurred in endemic areas (Burney, Ghafoor, Saleen, Webb, & Casals, 1980; Conger et al., 2015; Naderi, Sheybani, Bojdi, Khosravi, & Mostafavi, 2013; Pshenichnaya & Nenadskaya, 2015; Van de Wal, Joubert, van Eeden, & King, 1985), isolation rooms for CCHF have been established in treatment units throughout Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Georgia, Bulgaria, India, Kazakhstan and Kosovo. In addition, adequate training for the use of personal protective equipment and effective waste management and disinfection in the hospital setting have been implemented (Fletcher et al., 2017). However, as CCHF cases often enter healthcare facilities with non\u2010specific flu\u2010like symptoms, late recognition and diagnosis of CCHF cases may hinder the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the occurrence of hospital\u2010acquired CCHFV infection (Fletcher et al., 2017).",

The vaccine gained approval from the Soviet Ministry of Health as a preventative measure against CCHF after demonstrating safety and immunogenicity in humans. Although this vaccine elicited robust T\u2010cell responses against CCHFV and high antibody levels upon initial vaccination, four doses were required to induce even low levels of CCHFV\u2010neutralizing antibodies (Mousavi\u2010Jazi, Karlberg, Papa, Christova, & Mirazimi, 2012). To date, the protective efficacy of this vaccine in humans has not been established in controlled clinical trials and the crude nature of vaccine preparation makes it a less likely candidate for widespread use (Buttigieg et al., 2014). In addition, as the correlates of protection against CCHFV remain unclear, the development of an efficacious vaccine to prevent the disease remains an obstacle in the field. Thus, in the absence of adequate preventative options, therapeutic intervention is the primary mode of preventing mortality from CCHF, although their efficacy remains elusive.",

Newborn mice were found to be the most sensitive of this group and were the commonly used animal model for the study of CCHF disease until only recently. The newborn mouse model of CCHFV has been used to study disease pathogenesis, efficacy of treatments and transmission dynamics of the virus via ticks (Logan, Linthicum, Bailey, Watts, & Moulton, 1989; Smirnova, Zubri, Savinov, & Chumakov, 1973; Tignor & Hanham, 1993). The early use of newborn mice for studying CCHFV was necessary due to the lack of disease seen in infection of adult animals of several species, in which viremia could be detected, but show no apparent signs of disease before clearing the virus (Smirnova, 1979). However widely used early on, newborn animal models are typically not representative of disease progression in adult animals or in humans and newborns are often susceptible to a wide range of pathogens that do not cause overt disease in mature animals. Interestingly, several larger animals have been experimentally infected with CCHFV such as sheep, cattle, donkeys and ostriches to study the persistence of the virus in these species, rather than to model human disease (Smirnova, 1979; Swanepoel et al., 1998). Since the advent of genetic engineering techniques, the use of knockout mice has proven to be a more suitable model for the study of CCHFV pathogenesis and pre\u2010clinical testing of CCHFV vaccines and therapeutics.",

These animal models are defective in the innate immune response, which is believed to be critical in protecting mice from productive infection with CCHFV. STAT\u20101 deficiency prevents the upregulation of genes due to a signal by either type I or type II interferons. These knockout mice succumb to infection within 3\u20135 days and suffer from fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes (Bente et al., 2010). STAT\u20101 knockout mice also have high levels of viremia in the liver and spleen along with elevated pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. In contrast, the genetic defect of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice specifically affects the interferon type I signalling. IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with CCHFV develop acute disease and succumb to infection within 5 days (Bereczky et al., 2010; Zivcec et al., 2013). High viral loads are seen in the spleen, liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, lymph nodes and blood of the mice (Bereczky et al., 2010; Zivcec et al., 2013). Additionally, there is significant enlargement of the liver in infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. An advantage to using these mouse models is that they show characteristics of human disease such as early spikes in viremia in the blood, elevated liver enzymes, histopathological lesions in the liver and lymphocyte depletion in the spleen (Bente et al., 2010; Bereczky et al., 2010; Swanepoel et al., 1989; Zivcec et al., 2013). Both models are useful in studying the pathogenesis of disease as well as testing treatment options. They can also provide insights into immunological mechanisms of disease and viral clearance. Although using immunocompromised mice for the testing of vaccines is not ideal, these models are also a suitable model to test vaccines, providing an option that was not available with the use of newborn animals.",

            "text": "An interesting advance in animal models that could potentially serve as a model for CCHF disease is humanized mice. In contrast to previous mouse models of CCHFV infection, these mice develop functional human immune systems, including production of T and B cells following the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells, PBMCs or foetal liver and thymus (Brehm, Shultz, & Greiner, 2010). The functional human immune systems present are capable of mounting cell\u2010mediated and humoral immune responses against viral challenge. Different types of humanized mice have been used for the study of various human diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, graft rejection, as well as infectious diseases like human immunodeficiency virus and dengue fever (Koboziev et al., 2015; Li & Wood, 2014; Mathew & Akkina, 2014; Pearson et al., 2008; Simpson\u2010Abelson et al., 2008). Due to the difficulty in finding animals models that accurately recapitulate human CCHF disease, humanized mice are an interesting option for future research. Their use may provide researchers and clinicians with a suitable option for pre\u2010clinical studies in the light of the lack of CCHF models in higher animals such as NHPs. An immunocompetent animal model that might better reflect the course of human disease could go a long way for the development of vaccines and therapeutic options.",

Depending on the disease severity at the time of clinical presentation, patients may also require hemodynamic support, including transfusions of erythrocytes, platelets and fresh\u2010frozen plasma transfusion. Obtaining a complete blood count and accordingly providing blood replacement therapy is an indispensable component of the current standard of care for severe CCHF cases (Jabbari, Tabasi, Abbasi, & Alijanpour, 2012). Secondary bacteraemia may also arise in CCHF patients and are usually treated with the appropriate antibiotic regimens, such as ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (Sunbul et al., 2015). Co\u2010infections with malaria have also been documented and should be treated with anti\u2010malarials, such chloroquine, doxycycline or primaquine (Christova et al., 2015; Sharifi\u2010Mood, Metanat, Rakhshani, & Shakeri, 2011). However, treatments which may exacerbate bleeding are strongly avoided when disseminated intravascular coagulation is present. Administration of high doses of methylprednisolone demonstrated promise in CCHF patients presenting with virus\u2010associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHPS) and has also been used in the current treatment regimen (Dilber et al., 2010).

It has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus infection (McCormick et al., 1986). Synthesized in the 1970s, ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue, which can directly inhibit viral transcription by binding viral polymerases or by incorporation into nascent RNA genomes, causing viral RNA mutagenesis. It can also directly inhibit translation by inhibiting viral capping enzymes (Tam, Lau, & Hong, 2001). Ribavirin can also indirectly mediate antiviral activities via immunomodulatory effects, by inducing antiviral type 1 cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20102) and suppressing pro\u2010viral cytokines (IL\u20104, IL\u201010) (Tam et al., 2001). Lastly, it inhibits host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, disrupting intracellular GTP concentration needed for viral replication (Tam et al., 2001). CCHFV is sensitive to ribavirin in a strain\u2010dependent manner in vitro (Watts, Ussery, Nash, & Peters, 1989). CCHFV strains IbAr 10200 (Nigeria), SPU 128/81(South Africa) and HY\u201013(China) were highly sensitive to ribavirin, with 50% effective inhibitory doses (ED50) between 4\u20136 \u03bcg/ml; CCHFV strains UG 3011 (Uganda), AP\u201092 (Greece) and SPU 41/84 (South Africa) were less sensitive to ribavirin, with ED50s between 9 and 16 \u03bcg/ml (Watts et al., 1989).",

Eight CCHF patients all survived severe disease when administered oral ribavirin within a mean of 5.5 days (Erg\u00f6n\u00fcl et al., 2004). A multivariate analysis of confirmed CCHF patients at a Turkish hospital demonstrated that those treated with oral ribavirin and admitted within 2 days of symptom onset were at decreased risk of experiencing severe disease (Ozbey, Kader, Erbay, & Erg\u00f6n\u00fcl, 2014).

In other studies, oral ribavirin treatment of CCHF patients did not confer significant benefit regarding viral load or disease progression compared to patients who did not receive ribavirin, nor did it improve survival rates (Bodur et al., 2011; Ceylan, Cal\u0131ca, Ak, Akkoyunlu, & Turhan, 2013; Elaldi et al., 2009). Additionally, patients given ribavirin experienced delayed return to normal leucocyte counts and longer hospitalization times. However, these findings were not statistically significant (Koksal et al., 2010). The discrepancies surrounding the efficacy of ribavirin for the treatment of CCHF may be a result of multiple factors, including the administration of additional supportive therapies that may increase the likelihood of survival and variation in the initiation of treatment relative to symptom onset. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes may be necessary to confirm the benefit of ribavirin for the treatment of CCHF (Akinci, Bodur, Sunbul, & Leblebicioglu, 2016).",

Although the efficacy of convalescent blood products against CCHFV challenge has not yet been evaluated in animal studies, the use of convalescent serum harvested from recovered CCHF patients to treat newly infected patients was proposed as early as 1945 (Keshtkar\u2010Jahromi et al., 2011). Intramuscular administration of convalescent serum was first used to treat CCHF patients in 1967, but demonstrated lack of efficacy. Subsequently, in 1970, 61 patients intramuscularly administered 80 mL of convalescent serum either once or twice daily for up to 4 days following symptom onset did not exhibit statistically improved outcomes over non\u2010treated patients (Leshchinskaya & Martinenko, 1970). A patient administered 300 mL of convalescent serum during a nosocomial outbreak of CCHF in Dubai survived illness and experienced a shorter convalescent period compared to other survivors (Suleiman et al., 1980). In the South African CCHF outbreak of 1985, five CCHF patients treated with 2 transfusions of hyperimmune serum survived infection; four of five demonstrated improvement of symptoms after administration of the first dose compared to two untreated patients who succumbed to infection. Although the results were not statistically significant, this study suggested that continuous transfusions may better impact disease outcome (Van Eeden et al., 1985). Furthermore, these findings would suggest administration of protective antibodies may be a successful direction to explore.",

Early in the disease course, CCHF patients present with fever and loss of appetite, however, these are not significantly associated with mortality. Bleeding is a key feature of the subsequent haemorrhagic stage of CCHFV infection (Cevik et al., 2008). As depicted in Table 2., hematemesis (blood in vomit), epistaxis (bloody nose), gingival bleeding and melena (blood in stool), have been shown in multiple studies to be significantly associated with death (Cevik et al., 2008; Ergonul, Celikbas et al., 2006; Ergonul, Tuncbilek et al., 2006; Kaya et al., 2014; Ozturk et al., 2012). Bleeding from the skin was a significant prognostic factor in the study by Ozturk et al. (2012). In addition, an overall consensus between these studies shows that somnolence is another clinical sign significantly associated with mortality. While petechiae, maculopapular rash, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, eccymosis and jaundice are often seen in CCHF patients, they are currently not significant sign of mortality.",
