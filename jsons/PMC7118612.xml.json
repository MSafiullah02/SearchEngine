            "text": "Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening hemoglobinopathy that leads to poor quality and expectancy of life in children and adults [1], [2], [3], [4]. The condition is caused by a single missense mutation in codon six of the beta globin gene, resulting in increased clumping of hemoglobin in red blood cells, particularly in conditions of low oxygen tension with chronic hemolysis of small and large vessels highlighting the pathophysiology [1], [2]. Clinical manifestations, while highly variable between patients, include debilitating pain from vaso-occlusive crises, strokes with associated disability, cardiopulmonary abnormalities, vision impairment, priapism in males, chronic kidney disease, hepatobiliary disease, osteonecrosis of long bones, splenic infarction, and an overall increased risk of infections complications [1], [2], [5], [6], [7]. Sickle cell disease also negatively impacts the health-care system in terms of cost and work productivity resulting from mental and physical disabilities [1], [2]. Current management strategies, most commonly hydroxyurea and red blood cell transfusion therapy as well as crizanlizumab and l-glutamine, are disease modifying rather than curative and are each associated with unique challenges that often potentiate multiorgan system disease [7], [8], [9], [10]. Gene therapy has been shown to be successful, though not available on a broad scale and is associated with potentially severe toxicities [11], [12]. As a result, the condition is presently incurable without allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) [7], [13], [14].",

Cumulative data on over 500 children between the ages of 2 and 20 years who underwent matched related donor HCT are notable for sickle cell-free survival of 90%, transplant-related mortality of 6\u20137%, incidences of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) of 10\u201320% and less than 5%, respectively, and graft rejection rates of less than 10% [13]. However, patients have at most a 25% chance of having a matched sibling donor, and ethnic minorities have a 6\u201310% chance of finding a fully matched unrelated donor in the United States registry, meaning that most patients are ineligible for curative therapy, thereby necessitating the development of alternative donor platforms [15], [16].",

Haploidentical-HCT (haplo-HCT) provides near-universal donor availability for transplant-eligible patients, though historically has been limited due to high transplant-related mortality [21]. Pioneering work in drug-induced immunologic tolerance with administration of high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has mitigated severe acute and chronic GvHD and reduced, though not eliminated graft rejection, a problem that is more severe in patients with transfusion-dependent hemoglobinopathies due to alloimmunization from recurrent transfusions (Fig. 1\n) [21], [22], [23], [24]. Accordingly, we want to share progress with PTCy-based haplo-HCT platforms with an emphasis on competing strategies to improve transplant-related outcomes including graft rejection [2].",

The administration of PTCy on Days 3 and 4 post-haplo-HCT induced favorable rates of GvHD and graft rejection for patients with hematologic malignancies, though was first shown to be effective also in individuals with inherited genetic disorders [20], [21]. Seventeen patients were screened for enrollment and 14 were considered eligible [20]. The median age was 23.5 years. The conditioning regimen was reduced intensity and included cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, rabbit antithymocyte globulin, and 2-Gy total body irradiation, as depicted in Fig. 2\n, with the exception of thiotepa [25]. Patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating bone marrow allografts followed by GvHD prophylaxis with PTCy, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (Fig. 2). The results were favorable in that no transplant-related mortality was seen. In addition, 43% of patients had full myeloid chimerism and were off sirolimus at last follow-up. However, graft rejection occurred in 57% (8/14) of patients, reflective of inherent alloreactivity. Clinically, those who fully engrafted experienced resolution of vaso-occlusion, indicating the importance of mitigating graft rejection for improving transplant-related outcomes. Despite the high graft rejection rate, Bolanos-Meade et al. [20] demonstrated that less toxic nonmyeloablative regimens and haploidentical grafts with PTCy could reverse the sickle cell disease phenotype.",

Twenty-one included patients had sickle cell disease and two had transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The median age was 36 years. Participants were split into three cohorts that differed by doses of PTCy given (no PTCy, 50 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg, respectively), with the goal of determining the benefit of cyclophosphamide for improving engraftment rates. No patient had grades moderate-to-severe acute GvHD or severe chronic GvHD, which likely reflects that PTCy reduces alloreactivity. Furthermore, 86% (18/21) of the non-beta thalassemia patients survived, though 14% of patients with rejection (3/21) died. Engraftment rates and chimerism were highest in cohort three, though rejection was still 50% (4/8). One potential explanation is that the conditioning regimen was skewed toward tolerability rather than recipient immunoablation given the advanced age and increased number of comorbidities in the adult patients.",

The main limitation for the application of HCT is principally donor availability and toxicity of conditioning. Initial approaches using a combination of recipient immunoablation with conditioning chemotherapy and total body irradiation appear too toxic. Thus, most affected individuals are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning due to age, comorbidities, including dosing issues related to renal or hepatic dysfunction, risks of infertility, especially for younger patients, and fear of developing acute or chronic GvHD, which remains one of the reasons that patients and family decline potentially curative therapy [17], [18], [19], [32]. Nonmyeloablative haplo-HCT appears to address these limiting factors. Since 2012, multiple approaches have been utilized to combat the primary issue associated with haplo-HCT with PTCy regimens, namely graft rejection, which is partially inherent to the high degree of alloreactivity in the setting of HLA mismatch compounded by alloimmunization from high numbers of transfusions [33], [34], [35].",

Incidence of moderate-to-severe acute GvHD and subsequently chronic GvHD were also greater in the participants who received higher doses of total body irradiation. Both regimens were comparable in terms of graft rejection and overall survival, which is encouraging in terms of increasing future enrollment of patients on trials. Ultimately, regimens containing thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation and 400-cGy total body irradiation without thiotepa must be compared head to head in a prospective randomized trial to know the optimal approach to cure patients.",
