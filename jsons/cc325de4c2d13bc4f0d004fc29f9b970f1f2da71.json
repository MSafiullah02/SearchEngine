In this study, during the course of infection with srr7, small spongiotic lesions became apparent at 2 days post-inoculation (pi), they spread out to form spongiform encephalopathy by 8 to 10 days pi. We recently reported that the initial expressions of viral antigens in the brain are detected in the infiltrating monocyte lineage and in ependymal cells. Here, we demonstrate that the next viral spread was observed in glial fibrillary acidic proteinpositive cells or nestin-positive progenitor cells which take up positions in the subventricular zone (SVZ). From this restricted site of infection in the SVZ, a large area of gliosis extended deep into the brain parenchyma where no viral antigens were detected but vacuolar degeneration started at 48 h pi of the virus. The extremely short incubation period compared with other experimental models of infectious spongiform degeneration in the brain would provide a superior experimental model to investigate the mechanism of spongiotic lesions formation.",

            "text": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are characterized by neuronal loss, vacuolation, and, in most cases, accumulation in the central nervous system of causative agents such as abnormal prion protein (Prp Sc ). 1 However, in sheep scrapie, there is no significant neuronal loss and relationships between different magnitudes, topographical and cytological forms of Prp Sc accumulation, and clinical signs are not evident. 2 Furthermore, it has long been recognized that vacuolation is not always a prominent feature of the pathology of scrapie-affected sheep and mice with neurological disturbances. 3 Therefore, questions still remain to be answered, especially regarding the mechanisms and roles of spongiform degeneration in TSE, which show variable neurological and neuropathological features depending upon infectious agents and infected species. 4 The common neuropathology observed in and around the spongiotic area is astroglial and microglial cell activation after infection with Prp Sc , 1, 5 or with other infectious agents such as neuropathogenic murine retroviruses. 6, 7 The scrapie-infected cell homogenate triggers the recruitment of microglial cells by interacting with both neurons and astrocytes through upregulation of the expression levels of a broad spectrum of neuronal and glial chemokines very soon after the infection, before amyloid aggregates of the pathological prion protein become apparent. 5 A8 virus, a neuropathogenic murine retrovirus strain isolated from Friend leukemia virus, 8, 9 causes spongiosis accompanied by microgliosis in the rat brain after infection at birth. 7 The viral antigens are mainly detected in the blood vessel walls of infected brains, 10, 11 or in the endothelial cells of brain tissue culture. 12 The viral antigens on blood vessel walls are distributed throughout the whole brain and spinal cord of infected rats and are not correlated with the distribution of spongiotic areas. A closer association of the lesions with viral antigen expression has been observed in the infected and activated microglia. 6 In this report, we describe a neuropathogenic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced spongiform encephalopathy after the infection of mice. We recloned the srr7 (H2) virus (see Materials and Methods) from viral stock prepared as a soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutant, clone srr7, 13 isolated from a highly neuropathogenic MHV JHM strain, cl-2. 14,15 srr7 (H2) induced spongiosis within a short incubation period, at 48 h post-inoculation (pi). Furthermore, the viral antigens, which are detectable during the early phase of infection (between 12 and 24 h pi) in the inflammatory cells, appeared in meninges and ependymal cells without spreading into the brain parenchyma including the virus injection sites. 16 They were detected in the nestin-positive immature cells beneath the ependymal cells at 48 h pi when spongiosis became apparent, in spongiotic lesions no viral antigens were detectable. In addition, in the subventricular zone (SVZ) beneath the ependymal cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes projecting cell processes to the ependymal cell layer were found to be infected. In the developing mouse brain, the migrating neuroblasts (type A cells) advance as chains through tubes defined by the processes of slowly proliferating SVZ astrocytes, 17 commonly referred to as type B cells, which develop as the primary neuronal precursors in the SVZ of adult mice, 18 besides contributing to the niche environment together with macrophages and endothelial cells. 19 The neuronal stem progenitor cells in developing brains are targets of infection for viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), 20 coxsackievirus, 21 and Simian immunodeficiency virus. 22 In adult brains, neural precursor cells in the ependymal wall are susceptible to murine CMV infection. 20 However, none of the viruses induce spongiotic lesions. Possible mechanisms of spongiogenesis after infection with srr7 to neural precursor cells in the ependymal wall are discussed.",

The virus was used to infect DBT cells in the wells of 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 0.1-0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per well. At 24 h after infection, the culture supernatant in wells in which a single and distinct plaque was observed was transferred to na\u00efve DBT cell culture medium in 24-well plates. After three passages to obtain an adequate amount of the cloned viral stock for further experiments, the S proteincoding region of each clone was sequenced after amplification of the S gene employing a reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described previously. 24 A clone, designated as srr7 (H2), was selected for further experiments because it gave rise to a high titer viral production in DBT cells without showing changes in the amino acid sequence in the region of the S protein, although point mutations of the coding region for the S protein were detected at positions 528 (A to C) and 1578 (T to C) as silent mutations, without resulting amino acid substitutions. The stability of the recloned virus regarding virulence and pathogenicity was tested and compared with those obtained from 15 and 21 mice infected in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

The highly mutative nature of MHV 27 causes a tendency in mutant viruses to revert to the original neurovirulent phenotype. 28 srr7, a mutant isolate from cl-2 as a ssr strain, has, to some extent, been showing slightly higher neurovirulence, like its maternal strain (data not shown), whereas averaged neurovirulences and neuropathological characteristics have shown no significant changes. Therefore, we started recloning the virus strain and obtained srr7 (H2), which had the same amino acid sequence as the original isolate 13 in the region of the viral surface protein (S protein; see Materials and Methods). Although there could be mutations in the other coding or non-coding regions, which might influence the neurovirulence or host reactions, [29] [30] [31] after examination of the viral genome sequence coding S protein, we decided to use srr7 (H2) to study spongiosis induced by viral infection because srr7 differs from cl-2 only in one amino acid sequence in the S protein-coding region, 23 and, more importantly, the virus exhibited the same induction rate of spongiosis with a similar intensity between the experiments performed in 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 1) . After the recloning of srr7 in 2007, we performed our experiments using viruses in five passages after the initial cloning. Incidences of spongiotic degeneration and virulence in mice infected with srr7 were compared from the experiments carried out in 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 1) , because we considered the virus to be highly mutative (see Discussion). All of the 15 and 21 mice infected in 2007 and 2009, respectively, survived for the initial 3 days and died within 12 days pi (data not shown). Furthermore, in all of the neuropathologically examined animals, large spongiotic lesions composed of various sizes of vacuole became apparent 4-5 days after viral inoculation mainly in the pons, cerebellum, and thalamus (Figs 1,2) , the lesions were less extensive in the frontal area (Fig. 1 ) among the animals examined and compared in 2007 and 2009.",

In vacLesions each vacuole looked smaller and some vacuoles showed back-to-back attachment forming bunches (Fig. 2b,j) , each of which consisted of less than 100 vacuoles. The exSpongi exhibited several neuropathological characteristics. First, the lesion was fairly well-demarcated (Fig. 2h) . Second, the lesions were accompanied by few or no inflammatory reactions. This phenomenon occurs rather rarely in viral infections with apparent destructive lesions. At a lower magnification of exSpongi, many small nuclei were observed (Fig. 2h) , many of which were pyknotic and devoid of cytoplasm at a higher magnification (Fig. 2i) . We were unable to characterize the remainder, except for a few macrophages present in the lesions (black arrows in Fig. 2i ). Around the blood vessels in and around the exSpongi, almost no inflammatory cell exudation was observed either at the capillary level or at a larger size (thin white arrows in Fig. 2h-j) , including in the area with myelinated fibers (Fig. 2j) . The third neuropathological characteristic of exSpongi was that neurons looking viable were found in the lesion (white arrowheads in Fig. 2h,i) , where vacuoles attached to the neurons directly. The neurons were also well-preserved in vacLesions around the exSpongi (Fig. 2h,j) . The close association of small vacuoles with thick eosinophilic walls and the neurons (white arrowheads in Fig. 2i ) resembles the vacuoles formed in murine retroviral infection, 9 in which the vacuoles are shown as enlarged presynaptic bulbs. 8",

Although the initial viral antigen expression was detected in the inflammatory cells in the meninges as early as 12 h pi, followed by infection to the choroid plexus and ependymal cells, as reported previously 16 and shown in Fig. 2a ,c, they were eliminated from ependymal cells and the SVZ in the latter phase of infection (Figs 2 m,3 ). In addition, facing the ventricles a repaired line of ependymal cells with flattened cytoplasm and few cilia was observed (data not shown). Another trace of initial events could be detected as the pronounced activation of GFAP-positive glial cells in and around the SVZ. The gliosis was found to extend deep into the brain parenchyma and again in the middle of the exSpongi (black arrowheads in Fig. 2k ) GFAP-antigen expression was less extensive than that seen in the surrounding vacLesions. Even in this area with mild gliosis, astroglial foot processes around the blood vessels were an outstanding feature (Fig. 2l) , indicating that a key component of the blood brain barrier had been well-preserved in the exSpongi during the course of the disease, which conspicuously contrasts with pathologies involving an inflammatory perivascular cuff induced by infection with other strains of JHM virus, where there is a disappearance of astrocytes around blood vessels with inflammation followed by degeneration of the astrocytes with swollen cytoplasm around the blood vessels in the initial phase of cell infiltration. 32 To study vacuolar formation during the early phase of infection, we investigated infected mice at 48 h pi, because the viral antigens are distributed only in the restricted area 16 at this time while vacLesions become apparent (Fig. 2b,g) . Vacuolar degeneration was already detectable before 48 h pi, but the number of vacuoles and magnitude were so low that it was sometimes difficult to distinguish from an artifact produced during the preparation of sections (data not shown). In Fig. 2a (the dotted area with the letter b and arrow) a distinct vacLesion developed (Figs 2b,3) , but viral antigens were not detectable in this area or in the area between the boxed area and ependymal cells which expressed the viral antigens. Occasionally viral antigenbearing cells in the SVZ were observed extending their cytoplasm to the ventricle (black arrow in Fig. 2c) . We considered these to be B cells, GFAP-positive precursor cells resident in the SVZ, so we carried out double staining of serial sections next to the stained section (Fig. 2c) . As shown in Fig. 2e , a GFAP-positive cell projecting its cytoplasm to the ventricular surface was infected. Nestin-positive precursor cells in the SVZ were also infected (Fig. 2o) .",

Surprisingly, at 48 h pi, we found large vacLesions where viral antigens were not detected ( Fig. 2b-g) . On the same section as the vacLesions were detected and on successive serial sections, viral antigens were found only in restricted areas, as in the SVZ, where GFAP-positive cells with a peculiar shape, projecting narrow cytoplasm to the ventricular surface and leaving their perikaryon beneath the surface-lining ependymal cells, were found to have been infected (Fig. 2c,e) . The shape and localization of these astrocytes corresponded to B 18 or B1 19 cells, which serve as both stem and niche cells in the SVZ and play critical roles in adult neurogenesis. B cells bear GFAP and have a long basal process that terminates on blood vessels and an apical ending at the ventricle surface, with long cilia projecting into the ventricle, 18 which can be a target of infection via infected monocytes that have infiltrated the ventricle during the initial phase of infection. 16 It is not plausible for the infected GFAP-positive cells in the SVZ to have a direct effect on spongiogenesis, because the vacLesion is located a long way from the SVZ.",

It is presumed that B cell-originating migratory cells ascend in close contact with the basal lamina along with blood vessels in adulthood. 19 The cerebellar cortex receives its blood supply from the meninges that cover the cerebellum, in a different way from the cerebellar white matter. In addition, the granular layer is formed from granular neurons that have migrated from the external granular layer during embryonic and postnatal stages in mice. 33 Those astrocytes activated in a large area after being triggered by infection of the SVZ must have communicated with each other, leading to vacuole formation away from the infection sites. This cell-to-cell communication can be facilitated by direct contact between cells through an elongated cytoplasmic projection, as reported for the immunological synapse between leukocytes, especially between dendritic cells and lymphocytes. 34 Fine projections of astrocytes are detected in vacLesions, where, at a higher magnification, GFAP-positive foot processes were shown to be closely attached to the vacuolar walls (Fig. 2g) . Alternatively, signals can be spread by means of cytokine production, which is observed in all kinds of cell constituting the CNS (central nervous system), including astrocytes and neurons. 35 The contribution of microglia 36, 37 in this context should not be ignored, but the activation of microglia monitored by F4/80 or CD11b expression was not prominent at 48 h pi. 16 Furthermore, it has been reported that neurodegenerative progression can be protected by microglia and monocyte lineages 38 which produce neurotrophins. 39, 40 The finding that srr7 infection did not induce the prominent activation of microglia during the early phase of infection is markedly different from the spongiosis induced by infection with the neuropathogenic murine retroviral strain A8-V 8 . The A8-V-induced vacuoles showed close contact with either infected or non-infected microglia, with many activated microglia around the lesions. 6, 7 However, it takes a prolonged incubation period, 4-6 weeks after infection with A8-V, although a much shorter time compared with prion diseases, to observe neuropathologically apparent vacLesions. After such a long incubation period, there are several stages of neuropathological lesions and infectious agents either related or unrelated to the induction of spongiosis observed in the section can be scattered anywhere in the infected brain, leading to controversial findings concerning the correlation between distributions of infectious agents and lesions, typically reported in several prion diseases. 1 In srr7 infection, already at 72 h pi, the widespread distribution of viral antigens is observed, 25 which may disguise lesions produced by the indirect effects of infected cells.",
