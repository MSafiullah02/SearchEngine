            "text": "The host tolerance mechanisms to avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection that limit tissue injury remain unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent Clchannel, modulates airway inflammation. Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 3, a JAK family member that plays a central role in inflammatory responses, prominently contributes to the dysregulated innate immune response upon H5N1 attachment; therefore, this study aims to elucidate whether JAK3 activation induced by H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR channels. We performed short-circuit current, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses of the airway epithelium in Jak3 +/+ and Jak3 +/mice. We demonstrate that H5N1 HA attachment inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR Clchannels via JAK3-mediated adenylyl cyclase (AC) suppression, which reduces cAMP production. This inhibition leads to increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling and inflammatory responses. H5N1 HA is detected by TLR4 expressed on respiratory epithelial cells, facilitating JAK3 activation. This activation induces the interaction between TLR4 and G\u03b1i protein, which blocks ACs. Our findings provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of acute lung injury via the inhibition of cAMP-dependent CFTR channels, indicating that the administration of cAMP-elevating agents and targeting JAK3 may activate host tolerance to infection for the management of influenza virus-induced fatal pneumonia.",

Thus, an optimal immune response is characterized by a balance between efficient pathogen clearance and an acceptable level of im-munopathology (3, 4) . Tolerance to infection has recently been found to constitute a distinct strategy of host defense that limits tissue damage, facilitating a higher magnitude and duration of the immune response (5) . The elucidation of the inducible tolerance mechanism in response to H5N1 infection will provide new therapeutic strategies for severe lung damage mediated by viral attack by attaining an optimal immune response.",

            "text": "The mechanisms that typically maintain the homeostasis of various physio-logical systems are likely to contribute to host tolerance to infection (6, 7) . Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent Clchannel expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the tracheobronchial tree. CFTR channels secrete Cland mucus simultaneously with Ca 2+ activated Clchannels (CaCCs) (8) and regulate the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na + channel (ENaC), constituting the pathways that restrict Na + and mucus absorption (9) . Coordinating the regulation of the secretion and absorption of NaCl and fluids and airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis is crucial. Changing the salt and water composition of the periciliary fluid causes isotonic dehydration of the airway surface, leading to an impairment of mucociliary clearance. In the case of the \u0394F508-CFTR mutation, constitutive nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation results in IL-8-mediated chronic neutrophilic lung disease (10, 11) . Several investigators in the field believe that airway inflammation in CF is secondary to persistent bacterial infection, which results from impaired mucociliary clearance; however, recent evidence supports the hypothesis that the dysregulation of the inflammatory response is an intrinsic component of the CF phenotype and that airway inflammation may occur prior to or in the absence of bacterial infection. Moreover, numerous in vitro studies using human epithelial CF and control cell lines have confirmed that CFTR is an important inflammatory regulator and that CFTR mutations are associated with both the constitutive activation of proinflammatory signaling, especially NF-\u03baB, in the absence of any apparent microbial stimulus and the exaggerated responses to bacterial products (12, 13) .",

This activation was accompanied by the elevated secretion of chemokines/cytokines, including IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and RENTES. Furthermore, Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 3, a member of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine receptor-mediated intracellular signal transduction, is a molecular determinant in the H5N1 HA-induced dysregulated innate immune response. The inhibition of JAK3 activation causes the negative regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling (17) ; therefore, we speculated that H5N1 HA-stimulated NF-\u03baB signaling may be, at least in part, attributed to the disturbance of epithelial CFTR inflammatory regulation, a host tolerance mechanism to infection, via a JAK3 activationdependent response. The present study reveals for the first time that H5N1 HA attachment to the airway epithelia stimulates the JAK3 signaling cascade, leading to the suppression of CFTR inflammatory regulation and exaggerating innate immune responses.",

The addition of a single dose of the cAMP agonist forskolin to the micro-Ussing perfusion chamber caused an increase in the basal Isc (\u0394Isc) of the murine tracheal tissues, as expected. However, with HA pretreatment, we detected an additional increase in Isc (\u0394Isc) in the JAK3 +/+ mice compared with JAK3 +/mice, in response to forskolin ( Figure 1A ), but did not find the change under the condition of Clfree-KH perfusion (Supplementary Figure S1A) . Exposure of tracheal tissues of JAK3 +/+ mice that had received JAK3 inhibitor VI to HA reversed this HA-induced Isc decline, and \u0394Isc returned to basal levels in response to forskolin ( Figure 1B) . We observed that H5N1 HA had no significant effect on amiloride-sensitive sodium current after exposure of the tracheal epithelium to HA for the indicated time (Supplementary Figure S1B) .",

We verified that the exposure of the apical surface of tracheal tissues isolated from wild-type mice to HA (40 \u03bcg/mL) in the presence of a TLR4 inhibitor did not induce a detectable decrease in the Isc in contrast to HA exposure in the absence of the TLR4 inhibitor. The response of the tracheal tissue to forskolin following pretreatment with HA and the TLR4 inhibitor displayed a reduced \u0394Isc compared with tissue pretreated with HA alone ( Figure 6A ).",

To confirm that the decrease in the cellular cAMP levels after H5N1 stimulation was due to the increased activation of G\u03b1i/o proteins, these human airway epithelial cells were treated with a G\u03b1i/o protein inhibitor (pertussis toxin, PTx), a JAK3 inhibitor (JAK3 inhibitor VI) or a TLR4 inhibitor prior to stimulation with H5N1 HA. Treatment with PTx or JAK3 inhibitor VI completely reversed the decrease in forskolin-induced cAMP production following challenge with H5N1 HA. The reduction in cAMP production was not observed in TLR4 inhibitor-pre- treated cells. In addition, the simultaneous addition of IL-2, a JAK3 agonist, with H5N1 HA ameliorated the effects on cAMP production caused by pretreatment with JAK3 inhibitor VI. These results demonstrate that G\u03b1i/o proteins are activated by JAK3 following H5N1 HA stimulation in airway epithelial cells, contributing to the inhibition of the activity of AC, thereby reducing cellular cAMP production (Figure 7) .",

Consistent with this result, our findings show that the attenuation of the CFTR Clchannel by glibenclamide exacerbated H5N1 HA-induced acute lung injury, which was associated with enhanced NF-\u03baB translocation. These data indicate that a reduction in CFTR channel-dependent Cltransport underlies, at least in part, the HA-induced superinflammation. By contrast, in the presence of forskolin, which is commonly used to open CFTR channels by increasing cAMP levels, or a JAK3 inhibitor, bronchial epithelial calu-3 cells display reduced activation of NF-\u03baB p65 induced by HA challenge. Therefore, the CFTR Clchannel may play an essential role in the regulation of the innate immune inflammatory response by dynamically modulating Clmovement across the plasma membrane.",

Specifically, G\u03b1s stimulates AC, inducing it to catalyze the formation of cAMP from ATP, whereas the G\u03b1i protein exerts an inhibitory effect on AC. Recent studies have shown that TLR ligands activate G\u03b1i proteins in endothelial cells (22, 37) . The authors speculated that TLR2, 3 and 4 also interact directly with G\u03b1i via their intracellular domains due to a consensus motif for G\u03b1i/o binding. Consistently, our results indicate that cytoplasmic JAK3 activation evokes the interaction between TLR4 and G\u03b1i via their intracellular binding domains, leading to the inhibition of AC and reducing cAMP production. JAK3 activation, which is after activation of TLR4 by H5N1 HA, results in impaired cAMP-dependent CFTR regulation and CFTR gene expression, contributing to the exacerbation of immune inflammation. Therefore, we suggest that airway epithelial cAMP-dependent CFTR regulation represents an important host tolerance mechanism for limiting tissue damage to prevent severe immunopathology and that cAMP levels and CFTR function are closely modulated by JAK3 activity, which exerts an inhibitory effect on AC by activating G\u03b1i G-protein subunits.
