President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along with 50 governors declaring state emergencies. Social distancing and self-quarantine were advocated to flatten the epidemic curve in the hope of moderating the effects the virus may have had on the healthcare system, morbidity, and mortality. This directive caused grade schools, universities, parks, and any non-essential business to close. Some cities such as San Francisco have gone so far to make it a misdemeanor offense to leave home for non-essential purposes. These measures were put into place to prompt self-quarantine. The influence of self-quarantine on factors that impact weight change and obesity-related behaviors in adults is unknown.",

For example, although outdoor physical activity was still encouraged in some areas, it could be hypothesized that TV and screen time would increase during self-quarantine. Increased screen time in adults is a risk factor for obesity [8]. Additionally, mice placed in private housing gained more fat when compared to mice housed in groups [9]. In humans, social isolation has shown to be linked to increased leptin levels [10]. Thus, the number of people within a home may also impact weight gain during self-quarantine.",

Subjects were asked to reveal their age, gender, height, weight, employment status, duration of time spent indoors, weight change, and ethnicity. For \"duration of time spent indoors,\" the participants were asked to choose one of the following: 8-12 hours, 12-16 hours, 16-20 hours, or 20-24 hours. For weight change participants were asked to choose one of the following options: lost >10 pounds, lost 5-10 pounds, maintained weight, gained 5-10 pounds, gained >10 pounds. Participants were then asked how accurate they felt their weight reporting was on a scale of 1-10.2Social network questions. These questions asked about the body size of those whom the participants socialize. Participants were asked if their romantic partner was overweight, and if their close friends/family were overweight. This line of questioning has been found reliable [12]. Participants were also asked how many people reside in their home.3Factors that contribute to eating questionnaire. The Weight and Lifestyle Inventory (WALI) was used to assess possible changes in factors that contribute to eating. All answers were reported on an ordinal scale with the following options: has not increased at all, increased a small amount, increased a moderate amount, increased a large amount, or increased the highest amount. The WALI is a reliable instrument often used in weight loss research [13].4Sedentary behavior questionnaire (SIT-Q) is an open access questionnaire that has been shown to be valid and reliable [14]. The SIT-Q was used to gage TV/screen time. Participants were asked to report the number of hours and minutes they spent watching TV or playing video games. A separate question asked the number of hours and minutes they spent working on the computer. The SIT-Q was also used to gage sleep time. Participants were asked to report in hours and minute the amount of sleep they receive each night.5The Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire was chosen to measure physical activity behaviors during self-quarantine. The Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire is an open access questionnaire that is valid and reliable [15]. Participants were asked to report how many times per week and duration in hours and minutes they engaged in different modes of physical activity. All reported physical activity times were summed, and total physical activity time per week was calculated.6The Perceived Stress Scale was used in this study to assess the impact of self-quarantine on stress. The PSS asks questions related to stress, and the participant is asked to report on an ordinal scale ranging from \"never\" to \"very often.\" A total stress score is then calculated. The PSS has been found reliable and valid [16].\n",

Disinhibition, also called mindless eating, or the disruption of an inhibited state where loss of control over eating may occur is also linked with weight gain [18]. It appears that during quarantine, those who gained weight simply ate because food was available, not necessarily because of internal hunger cues. Prior research shows that when subjects are provided with large portions of food for many days, they will consistently overeat even though they report decreased hunger and increased satiety [19].",

For example, researchers in 2013 [24] randomized 90 women into one of two weight loss groups. Both groups were assigned to a hypocaloric diet consisting of 1400 calories with similar macronutrient profiles. The only difference between the groups was that one consumed half of their daily caloric allotment for breakfast while the other consumed half for dinner. By the end of 12 weeks, the group that ate most of their calories for breakfast lost approximately 13 more pounds than the group that ate bigger dinners.

It is plausible that the decreased sleep and increased snacking after dinner go hand in hand to provoke weight gain. Indeed, the majority of sleep research points to the fact that decreasing sleep duration promotes obesity because of increased opportunities to eat [25,26]. It is feasible that participants who reported less sleep ate more during the evening hours when they are awake. Lastly, hours spent in physical activity per week was another predictor of weight gain.

However, the current study did not look at weight change as a continuous variable but on an ordinal scale. It could be argued that a participant could more accurately identify if they gained 5-10 pounds compared to identifying an exact number of pounds gained or lost. Additionally, subjects were asked on a scale of 1-10 to report how accurate they felt they could answer this question. The average response was a 9, implying very high accuracy. It must be noted that the current study had to be conducted via questionnaire due to social distancing guidelines. An additional weakness of the study comes in the form of subject recruitment. Because an e-mail was sent out on social media accounts and then dispersed from there, it could be argued that the sample is not an adequate representation of the population. Although this may be the case, the current study still provides unique information about an unprecedented event within the history of the world. Lastly, it is understood that the data collected could be spliced and analyzed in a myriad of ways. However, to maintain the integrity of the research, the author attempted to stay focused on answering the primary research question, that is, \"what are the impacts of self-quarantine on behaviors that impact weight gain?\".

Currently, it is unknown if gained weight during quarantine will be lost after self-quarantine measures are reduced. Whether one is looking at weight gain in children over summer or in adults over the holidays, data suggests that those who gain weight during those times periods more than likely will not lose the gained weight [2,29].
