In the second case, the description of the spread uses the concept of multilayer or multiplex network, namely, a set of nodes (individuals, computers, etc.) connected by qualitatively different types of links corresponding to possible relationships among them (acquaintanceship, friendship, physical contact, social networks, etc.), each layer defined by a type of connection. Competitive viruses spreading simultaneously through different routes of transmission over the same host population, or the spread of a pathogen and awareness during an epidemic episode are examples of processes that are better described by means of multilayer networks [1].",

In fact \u03b1 is the Jaccard index, a statistic used for comparing the similarity of two sample sets, as defined in [11]. Just to illustrate that this simple statistical parameter can play a critical role in the qualitative response of a two-layer network model, in Sec. VIII we present a mean-field model for the spread of an infectious agent on one layer (contact layer). The model implicitly assumes an information dissemination on a second layer (notification layer) about the infection status of the nodes which causes an increase in awareness and the adoption of preventive behaviors. As an interesting feature, the overlap coefficient \u03b1 between the networks embedding the respective routes of transmission is a parameter of the model. This allows us to derive a simple relationship between \u03b1 and the epidemic threshold. Provided that one wants to perform simulations to validate this (or any) model, a systematic procedure to generate couples of networks of given size and degree distributions with a prescribed value of \u03b1 would be a useful tool. We stress that this is the main focus of the paper, and that the model in Sec. VIII is just a simple example to illustrate the convenience of having such tools.",

III and IV we estimate the minimum and maximum values (call them \u03b1m and \u03b1M) for the overlap coefficient between two networks of size N and degree distributions pA(k) and pB(k). In particular, we show that \u03b1m\u22480. The study of the maximum \u03b1M is based on the computation of the potential overlap Opot(DA,DB) between two fixed degree sequences DA,DB following pA(k), pB(k). In Sec. V we present the CR algorithm, that takes as input any two degree sequences DA,DB and a desired overlap \u03b1\u2208(0,Opot(DA,DB)) and generates a couple of networks with degree sequences DA,DB and overlap coefficient close to \u03b1. When DA,DB are randomly sampled from pA(k),pB(k), the potential overlap Opot(DA,DB) is called critical overlap. In Sec. VI we show that the CR algorithm starting with two random sequences succeeds in constructing pairs of networks having any overlap below the critical one and exhibiting some desirable statistical properties, specifically lack of in- and cross-layer degree-degree correlations. Of course the critical overlap belongs to the interval (\u03b1m,\u03b1M), and is higher than expected from intuition. In Sec. VII we show that for values between the critical overlap and \u03b1M there is an unavoidable direct relationship between overlap and cross-layer degree-degree correlation, and propose a refined version of the cross-rewiring (CR) algorithm that tries to reach values beyond the critical overlap while maintaining the cross-layer degree-degree correlation as small as possible.",

In the few previous works dealing with interacting epidemics on overlay networks [5,9,10], the two-layer network over which multiple pathogens spread was characterized by the probability \u03c1(kA,kB,kc) that a randomly selected node belongs to kA links unique to layer A, kB links unique to layer B, and kc common links [note that, using this language, what we are assuming here as a natural requirement is that the marginal distributions pA(kA) and pB(kB), that can be recovered as pA(kA)=\u2211kB,kc\u03c1(kA\u2212kc,kB\u2212kc,kc) and pB(kB)=\u2211kA,kc\u03c1(kA\u2212kc,kB\u2212kc,kc), are given]. Those papers put the main focus on the influence of the overlap and the degree correlations on the epidemic dynamics predicted by the model, rather than on the algorithms used to construct the two-layer network. So, the simulations to test the validity of the predictions were performed over particularly simple cases (rich enough, nevertheless, to extract valid conclusions). As an example, to test the model response to an arbitrary overlap \u03b1, the authors perform the simulations in the simplest setting pA(k)=pB(k)\u2261p(k), that obviously admits any overlap coefficient from 0 to 1, take\n\u03c1(kA,kB,kc)=p(kA+kc)\u03b4kA,kBkA+kckc\u03b1kc(1\u2212\u03b1)kA(attach independently kA+kc=kB+kc links to a node, with a probability \u03b1 for each link to belong to both networks), and execute a \u201cconfiguration model\u201d-like algorithm to connect pairs of stubs sampled from \u03c1 with the obvious restrictions. As another example, the respective effects of overlap and degree correlations are isolated by considering again simple (and extremal) cases: random overlap and no degree correlation; random overlap and full degree correlation; and full overlap.",

This probability is given by the quotient a/b, where b is the total number of rearrangements Y of the vector X (here we are using the notation introduced in the definition of the configuration model) and a is the number of such rearrangements having at least two consecutive entries i,j (or j,i) in places Yn,Yn+1 for n=1,3,5,...,2L\u22121. We have that\n(1)b=(2L)!k1!k2!\u22efkN!.Let us compute a. For l=1,2,...,L, let Yl be the set of rearrangements Y containing the entries i,j (or j,i) in places Y2l\u22121,Y2l. Then, a=|Y1\u222aY2\u222a...\u222aYL|. By the inclusion-exclusion principle, a=a1\u2212a2+\u22ef+(\u22121)ki\u22121aki, where al is the sum of the cardinalities of all intersections of l sets in Y1,Y2,...,YL. A simple combinatorial argument yields that, for l\u2264ki,\nal=Ll2l(2L\u22122l)!k1!\u22efki\u22121!(ki\u2212l)!ki+1!\u22efkj\u22121!(kj\u2212l)!kj!\u22efkN!,while al=0 for ki<l\u2264L. Using the previous expression and the inclusion-exclusion principle we get that\na=\u2211l=1ki(\u22121)l\u22121Ll2l(2L\u22122l)!(ki\u2212l)!(kj\u2212l)!k1!k2!\u22efki\u22121!ki+1!\u22efkj\u22121!(kj+1)!\u22efkN!.Taking it all into account, we get that the probability that G contains the link {i,j} is\n(2)pij=L!ki!kj!(2L)!\u2211l=1ki(\u22121)l\u221212l(2L\u22122l)!l!(L\u2212l)!(ki\u2212l)!(kj\u2212l)!.",

In all cases, the input degree sequences D,D\u2032 are random arrangements of the degree sets associated to the respective distributions. The obtained overlap is relatively close to the upper bound, suggesting that indeed the CR algorithm is able to sweep the entire range of permitted overlaps between 0 and Opot(D,D\u2032).\n",

            "text": "Before describing what we call the LS-CR algorithm (standing for label swap\u2013cross rewiring), we give an example of how it works. Let p(k),p\u2032(k) be two empirical distributions approximating respectively a Poisson distribution with \u2329k\u232a=10 and a scale-free distribution with \u2329k\u2032\u232a=12. Set N=10000. Let D,D\u2032 two random arrangements of the degree sets. The cross-layer degree-degree correlation is expected to be close to 0. Indeed, in a particular simulation we get \u03c4(D,D\u2032)=0.01470, while Opot(D,D\u2032)=0.57478=Ocr(N,p,p\u2032). So, since the cross-rewiring operations do not modify the cross-layer correlation, if we want a prescribed overlap \u03b1 smaller than 0.57478, the CR algorithm suffices to construct a two-layer network with overlap close to \u03b1 and a small \u03c4-b coefficient. But suppose that the desired overlap is significantly larger. To see how big it can be, rearrange the elements in D,D\u2032 to get two sequences \u03c3(D),\u03c1(D\u2032) increasingly ordered and compute Opot(\u03c3(D),\u03c1(D\u2032))=0.749283, that according to (9) is an absolute upper bound for the largest permitted overlap. The corresponding \u03c4-b coefficient is of course very close to 1: \u03c4(\u03c3(D),\u03c1(D\u2032))=0.949190. Suppose now that the desired overlap is very close to O\u00af, for instance \u03b1=0.73. We proceed as follows. Rearrange D\u2032 using the permutation \u03c3 [so \u03c3(D) is increasingly ordered while \u03c3(D\u2032) is not]. Both the potential overlap and the \u03c4-b coefficient between \u03c3(D) and \u03c3(D\u2032) do not change. Now we perform a series of swaps in \u03c3(D\u2032) of any of types (b)\u2013(e), that increase both the potential overlap and the \u03c4-b coefficient, until we reach the potential overlap \u03b1. Then, we perform as many swaps of type (A)-(B) as possible in order to diminish the \u03c4-b coefficient without modifying the potential overlap. After running this algorithm in our particular simulation, we get a sequence D\u2032\u2032 such that \u03c4(\u03c3(D),D\u2032\u2032)=0.648549. Of course the correlation is high, but significantly smaller than 1. Finally, now we can use the CR algorithm with input \u03c3(D),D\u2032\u2032,\u03b1 to effectively construct the two-layer network. If we repeat the previous scheme with a prescribed overlap \u03b1=0.65, still close to the maximum, we get a sequence D\u2032\u2032 such that \u03c4(\u03c3(D),D\u2032\u2032)=0.209785. It is instructive to visualize the evolution of both Opot and \u03c4 during the complete sequence of swaps (see Fig. 1).\n",

On the other hand, if one assumes that the probability of getting infected through an infectious contact S-I depends on the awareness state of the susceptible individual, then a second network layer B over which information about the infection status of individuals circulates can be considered. In the context of management and control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), an example of this second network layer is given by the partner notification program. This service helps to reach sexual contacts of patients of STDs and inform them that they may be at risk, and hence the need of seeking medical care [24,25]. So, in our approach, if a pair of individuals, one susceptible and the other infectious, are connected to each other in both network layers, we assume that the transmission rate \u03b2c (here c stands for common) will be smaller than the normal transmission rate \u03b2 because the susceptible partner adopts preventive measures to diminish the risk of contagion.",

Implicitly, this corresponds to the mean-field approximation that the local overlap around the node i (fraction of links confluent to i in the union network that are common links of A and B) does not deviate significantly from \u03b1. This assumption is clearly unrealistic in general. For instance, a particular run of the LS-CR algorithm with prescribed overlap \u03b1=0.5 over two exponential networks of 5000 nodes and mean degrees 45 and 30 leads to a mean local overlap equal to 0.5439 and a standard deviation of 0.1790.

Namely, (i) there is no in-layer degree-degree correlations, and (ii) the occurrence of a common link is the same for any pair of nodes in the network. So, the value of pB|A does not depend on the degree of a node in layer A and, hence, the overlap between layers is uniformly distributed (i.e., there are no parts of the network more overlapped than others). Assumption (i) is guaranteed by the algorithms. However, assumption (ii) is not feasible when the architectures of both layers are very different from each other. Then, our simulations have been performed on networks with two different architectures reflecting two extreme cases. First, we have considered two-layer networks where each layer is in turn a regular random network. This guarantees that both hypotheses are satisfied and, moreover, a good accuracy of the mean-field approach for this type of network if the degree of each layer is high enough.

From this fact, the initial condition is (sk(0),ik(0))=(pA(k),0), and integrating from 0 to \u221e the equation resulting from the sum of Eqs. (16) and (17), we have\n\u222b0\u221eIk(t)dt=1\u03bcRk(\u221e).Now, integrating (16) from 0 to \u221e, and using the previous expression, it follows that Rk(\u221e)=Nk(1\u2212e\u2212k\u03be), with \u03be:=\u03b20(\u03b1)\u03bc\u2329kA\u232aN\u2211kkRk(\u221e).

These figures also show the mean final epidemic size given by Eq. (18) after numerically solving Eq. (19) using the generated degree sequence in layer A. When the CR algorithm is applied and the distribution of major outbreaks is clearly distinguished from the one of minor outbreaks (otherwise to talk about the final size of an epidemic makes no sense), the predicted final size on RNNs is almost the same as the mean final size of the major outbreaks (4853 vs 4850, 4816 vs 4818, and 4776 vs 4775 for \u03b1=0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and rounded values). For the exponential networks, the predicted final epidemic size differs less than 5% from the mean final size of major outbreaks for most of the networks generated with the configuration model with different degree distributions (not shown here). In Fig. 3, this disagreement is indeed less than 2%. Therefore, in these cases the proposed mean-field model qualitatively captures the impact of the overlap on the expected final size of an epidemic.\n\n",

Given two fixed degree sequences D=(ki)i=1N and D\u2032=(ki\u2032)i=1N, we derive an upper bound of \u03b1 for any pair of networks sequenced as D and D\u2032, by assuming the condition (not realizable in general) that the intersection network has exactly min{ki,ki\u2032} links attached at node i. We call this upper bound potential overlap between D and D\u2032 and we denote it by Opot(D,D\u2032). Then we prove that an estimate (more properly, an upper bound) for \u03b1M is precisely Opot(S,S\u2032), where S,S\u2032 are degree sequences sampled from p(k),p\u2032(k) whose respective elements are increasingly arranged.",

We show that the CR algorithm with Drand,Drand\u2032 as input suffices to construct a pair of networks having any overlap below \u03b1c and exhibiting some desirable statistical properties, specifically lack of in- and cross-layer degree-degree correlations. Finally, when the desired overlap is beyond \u03b1c, we propose what we call the LS-CR algorithm, that minimizes the cross-layer degree-degree correlations that unavoidably appear for high values of \u03b1.",

The comparison of the epidemic final size with the average final size of major outbreaks obtained from stochastic simulations shows an excellent agreement on regular random networks of high degrees, and a qualitatively good agreement on exponential networks. Provided that one wants to perform simulations to validate this (or any) model where a multilayer network is involved, a systematic procedure to generate couples of networks of given size and degree distributions with a prescribed value of the overlap \u03b1 as those presented here seems to be a useful tool.",
