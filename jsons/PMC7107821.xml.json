The recently identified bocavirus was added. Transbronchial biopsies were performed under fluoroscopic guidance using standard procedures [25] and analyzed according to published guidelines [26] by senior pathologists masked to the viral results. Pooled nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from patients who agreed to the procedure. For technical reasons and reasons of cost (>10, 500 RT-PCR assays were performed), the procedure (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing) was limited to 80% of the cases selected during the entire study period. Swabs were immediately placed on appropriate transport medium and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further RT-PCR analysis. Shortly before each bronchoscopic procedure, a specific case report form was completed and symptoms, reasons leading to the BAL procedure, and the presumed diagnosis based on the available clinical data at the time were recorded. Rhinopharyngitis was defined as the presence of acute respiratory symptoms with at least acute rhinorrhea with or without additional signs suggesting acute sinusitis and/or acute pharyngitis (sore throat confirmed by the presence of inflammatory signs on clinical examination). Flulike illness was defined as the presence of a temperature >37.8\u00b0C plus 2 of the following 4 symptoms: cough, myalgia, sore throat, or headache. When available, lung functions measured 2\u20136 weeks before, at the time of, and 2\u20136 weeks after the BAL procedure were recorded.

We considered only acute rejection grade A2 or higher in the analysis, because most centers would not recommend high-dose immunosuppressive treatment for a lower acute rejection grade. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the frequency of respiratory symptoms in each category. Generalized linear latent and mixed models (Stata software, version 10; StataCorp) were used for analysis of lung functions at each episode to take into account the repeated measures in each patient at the 2 study sites. Odds ratios (ORs) for acute rejection associated with respiratory viruses were calculated using the same statistical approach for repeated measures. To investigate a potential time-specific relationship between respiratory viruses and acute rejection, we repeated our analyses of episodes restricted to 4 key periods: 0\u20133 months, 4\u20136 months, 7\u201312 months, and 112 months after lung transplantation.",

Of 343 biopsy specimens, 149 (43.4%) showed no evidence of acute rejection, 78 (22.7%) revealed minimal (A1) rejection, and 116 (33.8%) were graded A2 or higher. Similar to the analysis given in Table 3, we first tested the accuracy of the pretest clinical evaluation performed by the physician in charge. When acute rejection was suspected by the clinician in charge, this was histologically confirmed in 64.1% of cases in the absence of respiratory virus and in 84.6% of cases when a respiratory virus was simultaneously identified in BAL fluid (Table 4). Consistent with the results shown in Table 3, the presence of any respiratory symptoms, cough, or sputum was significantly associated (P < .004 for all) with the presence of a viral infection in BAL fluid, irrespective of the presence or absence of acute rejection. Impairment of lung function related to acute rejection was also significantly worsened by the presence of a viral infection (Figure 2). In patients with simultaneous acute rejection and lower respiratory tract viral infection, the FEV1 recovery rate was significantly slower than in patients who had acute rejection without simultaneous viral infection (P < .05). We found that the OR for acute rejection was <1 in the presence of a viral infection for each of the 4 periods studied (OR for any period, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20\u20130.88). The overall rate of viral infection in grade A0 and A1 cases was 25.4% (46 of 181), compared with 12.6% (13 of 103) in grade A2 or higher. Thus, patients with a lower acute rejection grade were twice as likely to be positive for viral infection than those with a higher rejection grade (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.04\u20133.9). When repeating these analyses with the presence of virus in the upper respiratory tract as a predictor of acute rejection, we did not find an association between upper respiratory tract viral infection and acute rejection (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.6\u20132.05). In a supplementary analysis, we verified the occurrence of acute rejection during a 30-day and 90-day period after baseline bronchoscopy. At 30 and 90 days, the probability of acute rejection was associated with the presence of acute rejection at baseline but not with the presence of virus (OR for 30 days, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.46\u20133.24; OR for 90 days, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.62\u20132.69) (Table 5).",

On the basis of a pretest clinical evaluation, patients testing positive were significantly more likely to present with respiratory symptoms (86.4%, compared with 60.9% with no identified virus). All analyzed individual symptoms were systematically more frequent in the presence of a respiratory virus, particularly cough and sputum, which were up to 3 times more common. Consistent with these observations, the pretest clinical evaluation performed by the physicians in charge considered that an infection was more likely in those with a final positive viral detection. Furthermore, lung function proved to recover significantly slower in the presence of a respiratory virus. All these findings corroborate that a positive association exists between positive viral nucleic acid detection in BAL fluid and the presence of an acute respiratory illness in lung transplant patients. This is also concordant with other investigations that have linked the detection of respiratory viruses by RT-PCR to symptoms [1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 13, 27]. However, our investigation differs from these studies by its prospective design, the large panel of respiratory viruses screened, the systematic use of BAL specimens, and the integration of pretest clinical evaluations performed by the physicians in charge. Many of the previous studies limited the detection strategy to upper respiratory tract specimens and used an array of molecular tools that was often restricted to a subgroup of viruses (eg, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, or bocaviruses were not systematically tested). Finally, the link with pretest clinical conditions was not detailed in many of these reports.",

            "text": "Because of the availability of lung biopsy specimens in all cases, we were also able to assess the presence of acute rejection according to the presence of viral infection. A relationship between acute viral infection and subsequent acute rejection has been reported in small case series, but this possible association has not been appropriately confirmed. Viral infection might trigger a chain of immunologically mediated events, leading to subsequent rejection or lung dysfunction. This is important because several studies have identified viral infection as a distinct risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and chronic graft dysfunction [1, 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18]. Our investigation had the capacity to address this question because we were able to analyze a high number of lung biopsy specimens together with viral screening at the level of the lower respiratory tract. The biopsy analysis revealed that viral respiratory tract infections were not associated with simultaneous acute rejection. Furthermore, we could show that the probability of acute rejection did not increase 30 and 90 days after a lower airways respiratory viral infection. When present, however, viral infections caused more severe lung dysfunction and significantly hampered the short-term functional recovery in the case of concomitant acute rejection. Because the clinician in charge was masked to any viral result, a positive RT-PCR result did not modify the treatment of simultaneous acute rejection. Thus, a less aggressive treatment of acute rejection in the presence of a virus cannot explain the slower recovery of lung function in these patients. This suggests that respiratory viruses per se do not promote acute rejection during the acute phase but could certainly worsen lung function and impair recovery from acute rejection episodes. Paradoxically, we even observed a negative association between an episode of respiratory viral infection and the subsequent cumulative risk of developing acute rejection. This should not be considered a protective effect of viral infections; more likely, it is a lack of an association or a chance effect, and we refrain from drawing any other conclusions. However, this strongly suggests that when analyzing biopsy specimens according to reference guidelines [26], pathologists should not be misguided by the presence of a viral infection.",

The positivity rate in the upper respiratory tract was 29.6%, compared with 16.6% in the lower tract. This difference in recovery rate is similar to that observed in other smaller studies [12], but, to the best of our knowledge, few or none of the previous investigations systematically analyzed paired specimens collected during the same procedure. An important observation is that when recovered only in the upper respiratory tract, respiratory viruses were less likely to be associated with lower respiratory symptoms. Another interesting observation is that only 7.0% of negative nasopharyngeal specimens were associated with a discordant positive BAL viral screening, thus suggesting a high negative predictive value. However, this value should be balanced with the relatively low prevalence of each individual respiratory virus in BAL fluid specimens and the possible technical issues related to nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabbing that could negatively affect the recovery rate. Our population was first selected on the basis of the need to perform a BAL procedure; for this reason, we caution that a lower respiratory tract viral infection in lung transplant recipients cannot be definitely ruled out by a nasopharyngeal swab. Yet this could be a reasonable initial screening strategy that needs to be confirmed in further studies and individually for each type of virus.",
