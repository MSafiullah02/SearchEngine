From this baseline we subtract the expected reduction in the number of passengers taking into account the temporary ban of some routes which was put in place since 23 January 2020 following the COVID-2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The results indicate a reduction of the number of passengers in the period January -March 2020 of -2.5%. This calculation considers only the complete closure of routes (not just direct flights) and not the reduction in the number of passengers on still active direct and indirect connections. At the moment of writing, with such partial information it is premature to quantify economic losses on the civil air transport and tourism industry. This note is meant to provide a baseline that be extended to all countries of origin and updated as more recent data will become available.",

Losses entail short-term shocks on industries such as tourism, air transport, disruption of supply chains and longer term indirect effects on decline in consumer demand and country risk premium. For the air industry, IATA estimated a loss due to the SARS epidemic of $6 billion revenue (8% of the annual traffic) for the Asia-Pacific airlines and $1 billion (3.7% of annual total traffic) for North American airlines in a period of 8 months between November 2013 and June 2014 (IATA, 2016) .",

For the forecast we use a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with a periodic intensity function calibrated on historical data (Iacus and Yoshida, 2018) and extrapolated non-linearly for the future years, e.g., the time series of all January's from 2010 till 2019 is used to calibrate a regression model with quadratic terms and the value for 2020 is projected accordingly. The intensity function of the non-homogeneous Poisson process is therefore the combination over all periods. This approach is needed to take into account that air passengers volumes show non-linear trends and cycles which are specific to each route, so a model has been fitted for each route as well.",

To have an estimate of the number of passengers lost due to flight suppression, we use a web-scraping strategy to look for all flights available corresponding to the 25,681 unique dyads in our data set. We used Kiwi 3 , which is a service used by travel agencies and individuals for on-line flight booking. It turns out that around 1,000 unique connections from China have zero flights in the period 7-25 February 2020 and thus we take it as a proxy of the real number of routes temporary cancelled due to COVID-2019 outbreak.",

On average February is the month with the lowest level of traffic (-16% compared to January in the case of Northern America and -7.7% in the case of EU). Flights towards the EU, UK and Northern America gradually increase during spring and reach e peak during the summer months. As introduced by Gabrielli et al. (2019), the seasonal component of monthly air passenger traffic can be linked to different types of mobility, from tourism to seasonal work migration. In this case, such differences in seasonality may be explained by the prevalence of business and labor mobility from/to Asia and Africa, and tourist flows from/to the EU and North America.",
