The Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction 2015-2030 (UNDRR, 2015) aims to substantially reduce impacts of disaster in terms of mortality, economic loss and damages, and disruption of basic services, while contributing to the mitigation of technological and security risks, through the provision of impact-based services (WMO, 2016). These services consider hazards, vulnerability and exposure. Governments, businesses and the public need to understand how the hydrometeorological hazard may affect their lives, livelihoods, property and economic activity in order to take appropriate actions.",

WMO through its relevant programmes and technical commissions guides the Members and facilitates the generation of high quality, reliable information and services and its dissemination, communication to various stakeholders, governmental authorities, sectors in support of decision making. WMO commissions include relevant experts not only from government agencies (i.e. not only National Hydrometeorological Services, NMHS) but also universities, research institutes and private companies. Federal agencies, such as NMHSs, may support but not necessarily have a mandate to provide services at the municipal level (unless through agreement). Urban services, if they exist, may also come from a variety of different providers.",

As the components of urban systems are tightly intertwined, having good predictions that are tailored for the different systems, spatially explicit at the appropriate scale and refreshed at appropriate frequencies allows for the systems to be operated efficiently and effectively. This is especially important when extreme events occur. For example, tropical cyclones (typhoons or hurricanes) impact cities around the world annually, causing a cascade of effects (Fig. 1) including hazardous meteorological conditions (blue); first order impacts (green); and follow-on impacts (purple). The latter impacts may be immediate, as with traffic accidents associated with severe convection (e.g. road flooding) or take longer (days - weeks) to manifest themselves (e.g. plant disease). These impacts (Fig. 1) are not exhaustive, as there are also socio-economic impacts to individuals, neighbourhoods, the city, region and often beyond.",

A 50-member Shanghai Emergency Management Response Committee (EMC, Fig. 3) was established and in February 2013, the Shanghai Emergency Warning Center was formed to enhance and improve the existing emergency procedures (Fig. 3). Thirty-six joint response mechanisms including co-operation agreements, warnings and action plans amongst 25 government agencies for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation were created.

Extensive sharing of capabilities and knowledge amongst services and sectors is needed to undertake comprehensive development. Although progress has been made, many scientific and technological questions remain; these include:\u2022\nEnsuring observations cover the range of spatial scale in cities. For example, recognizing the difference between within street canyon, within a park, above roof level (within the roughness sub-layer), within the constant flux layer (or inertial sub-layer) and the varying depths of the boundary layer, is important. It is crucial to consider what different instruments measure, given their different assumptions or variables actually observed (e.g. mixed layer height, mixing height, temperature inversion, Kotthaus et al., 2018). The state and variations of the physical and chemical characteristics of the three-dimensional urban atmosphere needs to be observed (Grimmond et al., 2010).\u2022\nRepresentation of urban form and function in models. The urban material (e.g. surface type), form (e.g. building density, height and surface roughness), function (e.g. anthropogenic effects and building use), urban hydrology (e.g. irrigation and sewer system), and urban vegetation (e.g. leaf area index, phenology, extent and height) all need to be captured to model the hydro-meteorological and environmental processes and their influences at different temporal and spatial scales.\u2022\nData assimilation: There is a need for development of schemes that can use 3D urban observations to improve model predictions in urban areas. These will require assessment and uncertainty analyses.\u2022\nEnsembles and coupled models: Evidence from a wide range of approaches to modeling the urban environment needs to be drawn on to select those that provide the most useful information on the probability of occurrence of hazards. Such modeling systems will certainly need to couple aspects of the urban surfaces (including walls) and its hydrology with the atmosphere and its pollutants; and in many cities IUS models will also need to incorporate the coastal ocean, lakes or (tidal) rivers. They will also need to include a means of assessing the sensitivity of the predictions to uncertain initial states and parameters, through use of model ensembles, for example.\u2022\nUrban atmosphere scales requirements (to drive other models). What scales are really required for useful forecasts or assessments? Understanding downscaling from global-regional models requires knowledge of the interactions of a range of scales and different approaches may be used depending on the characteristic time scales (Schl\u00fcnzen et al., 2011) or on the application purpose (Hoffmann et al., 2016). This will drive the development of tailored products and services.\u2022\nUnderstanding urban physical processes. What is the impact of cities on weather/climate/ water/environment (e.g., air quality, water quantity and quality, ecosystem, thermal variability, disease transmission)? This will drive the complexity (feedback loop) of models.\u2022\nImpact of changing climate on cities. How will the urban environment (e.g., public health, economy and ecosystems) react to climate change (e.g., air quality, water quantity and quality, heatwaves, dust storms, wildfires and other high impact events).\u2022\nImpact of changes to cities. Cities constantly evolve, through demographic and population change, economic development, urban fabric changes (e.g., urbanization, land use, energy use, transport, pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions, densification and suburbanization) and driven by adaptation to climate and hydrological changes.\u2022\nOther environmental hazards, e.g. earthquakes/volcanic eruptions/space weather, and their interactions with the atmosphere. Social and environmental consequences of these high impact events may change the physical nature of the city (e.g. infrastructure including telecommunications, transport systems, housing, energy production, food/water supply, disease).\u2022\nDevelopment of integrated decision support systems is needed to efficiently present relevant, often uncertain and conflicting information to technical experts, to support warning decision-making and should incorporate information about societal impacts, consequences and action statements. Understanding the impact on human response and behaviour is part of the decision-making process.\u2022\nCommunication and management of risk. A common understanding and language is needed to bridge the services and sectors and to articulate a better understanding of the range of risk and impacts in order to take appropriate mitigation actions to protect the public (e.g. early warning systems or urban design/planning).\u2022\nEvaluation of integrated services: Cost-benefit studies are needed for both initiation and sustainability of IUS, e.g. socio-economic evaluation of benefits, co-benefits (e.g. for climate), system operating costs and avoided losses.\u2022\nIdentifying and understanding critical limit values: for meteorological and atmospheric composition variables with respect to human health and for environmental protection.\u2022\nNew, targeted and customized user interface and delivery platforms: effective use of the many new communication techniques needs to be developed in close consultation with users to ensure that services, advisories and warnings result in appropriate action and, in turn, inform how best to improve the services.\n",

Indeed, the surveys identified that capabilities already exist to deliver urban services but there is often a lack of mutual-awareness. There is a need for more interaction in order to understand the requirements and capabilities of both the service providers and the service users (sectors). The challenge of local versus national mandates of roles and responsibilities can only be solved through collaboration, and cross-service and cross-sector approaches are needed.
