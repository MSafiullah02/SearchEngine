            "text": "Since adventure travel is subjective and what is adventurous to one person is not to another, the Adventure Travel Trade Association developed a definition of adventure travel which has three main components, 1) physical activity, 2) connection with nature and 3) immersive cultural experience [4]. To meet the definition an activity must contain two of three components. In this article we included activities that are high risk, require substantial physical activity and are considered less common than conventional travel activities such as sightseeing, cultural experiences, or participating in local festivals. For example, canoeing is considered adventure travel, but is low risk activity, however, whitewater canoeing/kayaking/rafting were included due to the physical exertion and high-risk nature. As this paper's goal is to explore infection risk of adventure travel not yet well defined, several activities with well defined infection risks, such as fishing, hunting and safaris were excluded. Injuries such as fractures, head injuries, eye injuries and lacerations are by far the most common medical problem associated with these activities and education on prevention should be covered during pre-travel consultations [5]. An excellent text by Heggie and Caine provides a comprehensive review of injuries associated with adventure sports. However, in this review, we focus specifically on infections related to adventure travel using case series, case reports, and epidemiologic studies [3]This study will give travel practitioners the ability to educate travelers and give appropriate prophylaxis advice and education based on their activity.",

Recently, other animals have also been suggested as reservoirs including dogs, cattle, bats and sea lions [6]. In 1996 an outbreak in whitewater rafters occurred in Costa Rica during the rainy season when water levels were particularly high. Further analysis of the cases suggested that individuals who were submerged and swallowed a significant amount of water were at increased risk of developing disease [7]. Two cases in 2002 were diagnosed after a whitewater rafting trip in Ecuador and Costa Rica [8]. Van de Werve et al. reported 15 cases of leptospirosis in their Belgian travel clinic from 2008 to 2011, 4 of which occurred after participation in whitewater sports [7]. Outbreaks in rafting groups in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Switzerland have also been reported with some having a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction upon initiation of beta-lactam therapy [9], [10], [11]. For adult patients traveling to endemic areas prophylactic doxycycline at a dose of 200 mg weekly is highly effective [12] and should be considered in those participating in whitewater sports, especially if traveling during the rainy season or a time of flooding.",

            "text": "Schistosomiasis, is a parasitic disease caused by schistosome flukes that also occurs in freshwater. Multiple groups of rafters have been infected on trips of the Omo river in Ethiopia. In 1984 a group of Americans developed schistosomiasis after rafting this river, 6 of 11 members developed Schistosoma mansoni infections with 5 having symptoms of acute disease [13]. Schwartz et al. analyzed groups who went on rafting trips in 1993 and 1997, on the Omo river, among those, 44 travelers had serology analysis, 28 with positive serology and 16 developed symptoms [14]. In 1997 Morgan et al. described 69 travelers who used the Nile recreationally and were analyzed pre and post exposure for schistosomiasis with 4/26 seroconversions in rafters or whitewater kayakers [15]. Roser et al. did a similar study in 2009 with 36 travelers exposed to freshwater in Uganda during a whitewater trip. In this group 14/26 developed positive serology after the trip with one developing acute schistosomiasis [16]. It is a common misunderstanding among travelers and whitewater guides that flowing water negates the risk for schistosomiasis, however, travelers should be advised about the risk of schistosomiasis in all endemic freshwater. Travelers should avoid purposeful swimming in freshwater, and if accidental submersion occurs then quick towel drying or alcohol rubbing may be helpful in the prevention of disease [17]. Testing and treatment of symptomatic individuals upon return if they have participated in recreational water sports in endemic areas should be performed to prevent long-term complications.",

            "text": "Injuries and illnesses are common occurrences of windsurfers, kiteboarders and surfers given the high-risk nature of the sports [3]. Ear conditions such as external auditory exostoses, tympanic membrane rupture and external otitis are common among surfers as they undergo frequent pressure changes, and water submersions [23], [24]. Surfers are at high risk of lacerations, either from coral, rocks or their own surfboard. These lacerations have the potential to become infected with water-borne organisms such as Vibrio, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Erysipelothrix and treatment should be initiated with a third generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone [23], [24], [25]. Mycobacterium marinum should be considered in non-healing water exposed wounds, especially if it is on the extremities. Laboratory diagnosis may require incubation at a lower temperature and can take 2\u20136 weeks to grow [25]. Harding et al. did a web-based survey of surfers in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to determine how behavior affected the health of surfers [26]. Sore throat, cough, diarrhea were common occurrences in illnesses experienced by surfers. Surfing during a rainy time period, a health advisory or near an outfall increased the likelihood of illness. Interestingly, most surfers were not aware of health advisories; hence, travel practitioners should advise patients to monitor the local health status of the beaches. Heavy rainfall results in contaminated runoff and surfing under these conditions increases the risk of exposure to water contaminated with human waste. Surfers need to be educated that lacerations need to be cleaned thoroughly and immediately after injury. Prompt medical attention should be sought if signs of infection exist so appropriate antibiotics and wound care can be initiated. Windsurfers are at similar risk of superficial infections and GI illnesses. In 1984 an epidemiologic study looked at a population of windsurfers who competed in polluted water [27]. Common symptoms in the study were diarrhea, abdominal pain, otitis, conjunctivitis and superficial skin infections. Relative risk for those who competed in polluted water were 6.7, 5.2, 1.8, 1.9 and 2.3 respectively. Hepatitis A is spread via the fecal-oral route and is a concern for patients who routinely use contaminated beaches. Surfers are at high risk of hepatitis A infection and are three times more likely to have had hepatitis A infection when compared to windsurfers [28], [29]. These data suggest that patients participating in surfing or windsurfing should research the areas where they will be surfing to ensure there are no advisories due to pollution. In addition, hepatitis A vaccine should be offered to all surfers and considered for others participating in water sports.",

Infections associated with scuba diving are typically associated with exposure to water and include infections with water-based pathogens as described above. Infections related to polluted water, and common skin infections associated with sharing equipment, such as Staphylococcus aureus or herpes labialis, are also possible [30], [31], [32], [33]. Red tide is a large algae bloom, which can lead to toxin production and dramatically increase the bacterial load in ocean water. Respiratory, gastrointestinal illness or neurologic disease is common after exposure to red tide, however the large bacterial burden can cause a variety of infections. One case reported a scuba diver who presented with bilateral otitis externa, which subsequently developed into bilateral mastoiditis after diving during a known red tide [33]. Scuba divers should avoid areas where red tide is reported and should check local conditions prior to diving [34], [35]. Exposure to marine life can place people at risk for uncommon infections such as Pseudomonas oryzihabitans cellulitis after a bite from an octopus while snorkeling [36], or cellulitis after brushing against poisonous corral [37]. Schistosomiasis has also been described in scuba divers after exposure to endemic waters [38], [39].",

Bats are suspected to carry hantavirus, lyssavirus, coronavirus, henipavirus, and filovirus including Marburg and Ebola [69]. Interestingly, in rural Ghana almost 50% of individuals visit bat caves with 37% of people reporting exposure either via bites, scratches or urine. In addition, 46% of individuals reported eating bat meat. Vora et al. report a study done after a bat festival in Idandre, Nigeria, where males entered caves to hunt bats. Many of the participants sustained scratches and bites from bats, but none reported a serious illness [70]. In 2008, two patients developed Marburg hemorrhagic fever after exploring Python cave in Uganda, the fatal case was imported to the Netherlands and another was imported to Colorado, USA. In 2011 4 miners in Uganda were diagnosed with Marburg virus after working in a tunnel mine, a roosting site for thousands of bats [7], [71], [72]. Marburg virus has a case fatality rate of almost 80% [73] and is strongly associated with cave exposure. Nipah virus is a henipavirus and a cause of encephalitis and respiratory illness in Asia. This virus utilizes fruit bats and pigs as a reservoir, cases to date have been associated with pig farming and contaminated date palm sap. No cases of Nipah virus infection have been associated with caving. Despite wide publicity little evidence of a link between spelunking and Ebola virus infection exists. Human-cave and human-bat interactions have occurred for thousands of years with relatively few outbreaks, despite a high frequency of bites, scratches and exposure to aerosolized bat excreta. Alternative theoretical reservoirs are also possible such as an insect that interacts with humans and bats or a host in rivers or river beds [74]. Spelunking may pose a risk and clinicians should have a high suspicion of viral hemorrhagic fevers in patients who have returned from tropical destinations with fever, rapid clinical deterioration and hemorrhage. Travelers should also check local sources to ensure there is not a local outbreak in the area they will be spelunking.",

In 2014 Mehal et al. showed that even though more cavers were aware of the increased risk of rabies from bat bites compared to years prior (100% compared to 85% in 2010 and 2000 respectively), pre-exposure prophylaxis for rabies has actually decreased from 56% to 45% over the ten years studied [77].

Orienteering involves traversing the wilderness at a rapid pace using primitive means of navigation. Risks associated with these activities include dehydration, hyperthermia, hypothermia, trauma, and excessive exposure to UV radiation [83]. Adventure race participation has doubled yearly since 2010 and in 2013, over 4 million people participated in adventure races in the United States [84]. These races consist of biking, running, kayaking, swimming, and orienteering through areas of wilderness with no marked trails. These races are frequently held on farmlands where there is potential for exposure to feces from a variety of farm animals including cattle, poultry, and swine. This risk is even higher in the \u201cslurry fields\u201d which are mud fields made by combining water with soil-frequently contaminated with animal feces [85]. Campylobacter enteritis is an infection caused by Campylobacter jejuni or C. coli and is a frequent cause of foodborne disease, but can also be transmitted from direct contact with animals, their feces, or infected bodies of water. Cases of campylobacter infections associated with adventure racing have been reported in Nevada and British Columbia [85], [86] An outbreak of norovirus occurred in France during an obstacle race and resulted in over 800 cases of acute gastroenteritis [87]. Public health experts postulated that contamination of the mud occurred and then resulted in the majority of cases. Trekking may also increase the risk for travelers of contracting typhoid fever [88]. Physicians should counsel travelers to avoid swallowing water during these races and discuss the potential for acute diarrheal illnesses and other infections transmitted via fecal-oral routes. If a patient presents after an adventure race or mountain bike race with diarrhea, there should be a high suspicion and low threshold to test and treat for campylobacter or other fecal-oral pathogens. Patients with infectious gastroenteritis generally improve with conservative treatment, however, in severe cases or immunocompromised hosts, cases should be treated with either azithromycin or fluoroquinolones.",

Lyme disease is an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick in the United States. In Europe and Asia, Borellia afzelii and Borerelia garinii can cause Lyme disease. Shelters used by trekkers in the USA are inhabited by the mouse Peromyscus leucopus, the preferred host of the I. scapularis tick, placing many of these hikers at risk of Lyme disease if they visit endemic areas, yet few recognize the early stages of Lyme disease. In a study by Knoll et al., only 54% of hikers were able to recognize the rash of erythema migrans [103]. Trekkers in Lyme endemic areas should be aware of the initial signs and symptoms of Lyme disease so they can get treated early. Similarly, an outbreak of Rickettsia africae or African tick bite fever, was reported after an adventure race in South Africa. R. africae is transmitted by the very aggressive Amblyomma ticks. The patients in this case presented with fever, headaches, lymphadenopathy, and multiple eschars. Most participants were diagnosed by serology and successfully treated with doxycycline [104]. While we could not find reports of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tick borne encephalitis, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, Q fever, brucellosis or other rickettsial diseases in adventure travelers, the potential exposure to ticks and wildlife places them at risk for these or other vector-borne diseases.",

Two individuals who participated in an orienteering contest in Denmark became sick with fever, fatigue and lymphadenitis with serologies positive for Francisella tularensis-one improved with doxycycline, the other spontaneously. It was postulated that both contracted tularemia through contact with dirt and contaminated water on open cuts [105]. Given the high risk of laceration and soil exposure individuals participating in orienteering contests should be up to date on their tetanus vaccine [106]. A study performed in Scandinavia showed an increase prevalence of positive serologies for Bartonella spp.: 31% in elite orienteers compared to 7% in healthy blood donor controls. It was thought that this could possibly be the reason for an increase in sudden cardiac death seen in competitors in orienteering events [107]. Pandey et al. conducted a study looking at individuals visiting Nepal who presented to clinic with possible rabies exposure. The data from their study did not show an increase in rabies exposure in those trekking in nepal, but did show an increase in foreign residents over tourists [108].",

There have been cases of Scedosporium, Sporothrix, Pseudallescheria and Nocardia in cyclists after accidents [114], [115], [116], [117]. Cyclists often compete and train in close proximity increasing the risk for tinea corporis from Microsporum canis\n[118]. The prolonged nature of many bicycle races leaves athletes exposed for prolonged periods of time, increasing the risk of mosquito borne diseases. Stojkovic et al. describe a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis (L. major) in a patient who had spent a week biking in Tunisia [119]. Schistosomiasis has been reported in Zimbabwe in a group of triathletes who swam near a fresh water dam. Eighty percent of triathletes had schistosomiasis compared to only 38% of controls from the area [120].",
