It is now clear that some patients present for transplantation with preformed anti-HLA antibodies, which are usually acquired through prior pregnancy, transfusions, or transplantation. Immune stimulation by prior infections or autoimmunity might contribute to the development of antibodies to allo-MHC in those patients with no identifiable risk factors. These pre-existing antibodies can react with donor antigens, leading to immediate graft loss (hyperacute rejection) or accelerated humoral rejection and BOS.6 In addition, some lung transplant recipients appear to mount a humoral response to the allograft after transplantation. Most evidence suggests that this humoral response occurs to donor MHC antigens, although other endothelial or epithelial antigens expressed in the lung may become antibody targets as well. T-cells activated through indirect presentation provide help for B-cell memory, antibody class switching, and affinity maturation in the presence of appropriate cytokines and costimulatory factors. Acute and chronic humoral rejection have been well described in renal transplantation.6 Furthermore, histologic features of antibody-mediated rejection can be found on lung biopsy in the absence of measurable anti-HLA antibodies.7\n",

When present, symptoms range from dyspnea, cough, or sputum production to acute respiratory distress, with physical findings that may include fever, hypoxia, and adventitious sounds on lung auscultation.8 Because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms and signs, emphasis should be placed on objective data, mainly pulmonary function testing, in identifying patients at risk for rejection. Spirometry has been found to have a sensitivity of greater than 60% for detecting infection or rejection grade A2 and higher, but it cannot differentiate between the two.9 Radiographic imaging of lung transplant patients is useful in identifying specific causes of symptoms or decreased pulmonary function, such as focal infections or neoplasms. Findings of ground glass opacities, septal thickening, volume loss, and pleural effusions on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scans suggest acute rejection. Although early small studies attempted to demonstrate the usefulness of chest radiographs and chest CT scans in the diagnosis of rejection, more recent data show very low sensitivity for acute rejection (as low as 35%) and no discriminatory value between rejection and other processes.10, 11 Given the poor specificity of pulmonary function tests and radiographic studies, the authors discourage empiric treatment of rejection and recommend histopathologic analysis of lung tissue to diagnose and grade acute lung rejection. The incidence of acute rejection is highest within the first year after transplant, arguing for a high clinical suspicion during this time period.",

It allows acute rejection to be distinguished from other potential etiologies of allograft dysfunction such as airway stenosis or infection. Most transbronchial biopsies are performed in the lower lobes, a practice that seems reasonable in light of data showing that different lung lobes have similar rejection grades and that if rejection is present, the grade is usually worse in the lower lobes as compared with the upper lobes.12 The Lung Rejection Study Group (LRSG) now recommends 5 pieces of well-expanded alveolated lung parenchyma to provide adequate sensitivity to diagnose rejection.13 Adverse events reported with bronchoscopy in lung transplant recipients are relatively low and include transient hypoxemia (10.5%), bleeding greater than 100 mL (4%), clinically significant pneumothorax (0.6\u20132.5%), arrhythmia (0.57%\u20134%), possibly postprocedural pneumonia (8%), and ventilation support (0.32%), but no reported mortality.14, 15, 16, 17\n",

Many centers perform scheduled bronchoscopies at about 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and annually after transplant, in addition to the clinically-indicated and post-rejection follow-up bronchoscopies.18 The rationale includes the occurrence of clinically silent acute rejection, inadequate surrogate markers for acute rejection, and the relatively low risks of the bronchoscopy procedure. Grade A2 and higher acute rejection has been found in up to 18% to 39% of asymptomatic patients,14, 19, 20 with occasional presence of late-onset acute rejection beyond 1 year after transplant.21 Disputing this approach, one group showed that 3-year outcomes in patients who underwent only clinically-indicated bronchoscopies were comparable to outcomes in patients who underwent surveillance bronchoscopies,15 as well as to the ISHLT database outcomes.22 A randomized trial would be helpful to determine the benefit of surveillance bronchoscopies in lung transplant recipients.",

Although no effective serum biomarkers are currently in use in clinical lung transplant, many have been studied, and some, such as the hepatocyte growth factor, have been shown to correlate with acute rejection in small single-center studies.30 In 2002, the Cylex Immune Cell Function Assay (ImmuKnow; Cylex, Incorporated, Columbia, MA, USA) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to measure global immune function in solid organ transplant recipients. This assay measures the in vitro production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the patient\u2019s peripheral blood CD4 T-cells in response to stimulation by phytohemagglutinin-L. Several studies in kidney, liver, heart, and small bowel allograft recipients have demonstrated that low ATP levels (\u2264225 ng/mL) correlate with infection, while high levels (\u2265 525 ng/mL) are associated with rejection.31 Two studies that evaluated this assay in lung transplant recipients demonstrated that low ATP levels correlated with infection,32, 33 but association with acute rejection was not assessed. Preliminary data published in abstract form showed that 87% of lung rejection episodes occurred in the setting of low-to-moderate ATP levels.34 Additionally, exhaled breath analysis studies have shown some promising results. Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been correlated with lymphocytic bronchiolitis35 and acute rejection,36 and, in a study of inert gas single-breath washout, the slope of alveolar plateau for Helium (SHe) had a sensitivity of 68% for acute rejection.9 In summary, no surrogate markers have been sufficiently validated as a means to reproducibly identify patients with acute rejection with adequate specificity, and none supplant direct histopathological examination of lung tissue. Nevertheless, further studies in this arena will likely provide valuable information about underlying mechanisms of rejection and better explain clinical heterogeneity of the disease.",

Decreased rejection has been shown for grafted kidney, liver, and heart in combined heart\u2013kidney, liver\u2013kidney, and heart\u2013lung transplant recipients,58, 59 although this benefit does not seem to translate into prolonged graft or recipient survival.

Standard immune suppression includes a calcineurin inhibitor, a cell-cycle inhibitor, and a corticosteroid. Several studies suggest that there may be lower incidence of acute rejection with tacrolimus as opposed to cyclosporine.62, 63 One randomized double-blind trial showed decreased rejection with everolimus as opposed to azathioprine.64 The self-reported ISHLT registry data support the idea of decreased acute rejection episodes with tacrolimus and MMF as compared with cyclosporine and azathioprine.1 Surprisingly very few studies have directly examined the link between levels of immunosuppression and acute rejection. High titers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in peripheral blood, a surrogate marker of a high overall level of immunosuppression, have been found to correlate with lower incidence of acute rejection.65 Furthermore, one episode of early high-grade acute rejection appears predictive of additional acute rejection episodes within the first year after lung transplant, suggesting that more aggressive immunosuppression should be used in these patients.45\n",

In this regard, the authors have found reduced acute rejection in association with a variant in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that blunts the innate immune response, and increased rejection with a CD14 variant that augments the innate response.70, 71 Although these studies suggest that polymorphic variants outside of the HLA region also influence the risk for acute rejection, larger multicenter efforts are needed to fully validate these findings and also test for gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions among relevant polymorphisms.",

There has been clear consensus that grade A2 and higher-grade rejection episodes require treatment. However, in light of recent evidence that grade A1 rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis are major risk factors for BOS, treatment seems prudent for those entities as well. The mainstays of treatment for acute lung rejection are pulse steroids. Several studies from the 1990s showed successful resolution or improvement of acute rejection after high-dose steroid treatment.38, 87 There are no data to clearly guide dosing of the pulse steroids; a standard dose is 500 mg of methylprednisolone intravenously,4 although centers use doses that range from 125 mg up to 1000 mg per day. Duration of treatment also varies but typically includes at least 3 doses, followed by an oral prednisone taper.",

Post-transplant vascular injury with pulmonary capillaritis has been described as an atypical form of rejection that may be resistant to steroids but in several cases responsive to plasmapheresis, suggesting that it may represent an antibody-mediated process. The clinical presentation of this form of pulmonary capillaritis typically includes dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, mimicking acute cellular rejection.108 Frank hemoptysis, reflecting underlying diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, has been described in a subset of recipients with antibody-mediated capillaritis and should prompt consideration of this entity.108, 109\n",

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is one of the most common therapies used to decrease antibody-mediated immunity, with a relatively low adverse effect profile. IVIG causes B-cell apoptosis, reduces B-cell numbers, blocks binding of donor-reactive antibodies, and may inhibit complement activation. The peri-transplant use of IVIG and plasmapheresis at the authors\u2019 institution in presensitized patients led to elimination of antibodies in 6 of 7 patients with class I anti-HLA antibodies and 1 of 3 patients with class II anti-HLA antibodies. As a group, those presensitized patients who received this regimen demonstrated a significant decrease in acute rejection episodes and a trend toward greater freedom from BOS compared with a cohort of presensitized patients who did not receive desensitization therapy.99 Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that causes B-cell depletion, has been proven effective in the treatment of presensitized renal transplant recipients in conjunction with IVIG.6, 118 In a recent study of 61 lung transplant recipients with newly acquired post-transplant donor-specific antibodies, a regimen of IVIG combined with rituximab (44 patients) or administered alone (17 patients) led to clearing of antibodies in 62%.119 Notably, freedom from BOS and survival were better in the group of patients who cleared their donor-specific antibodies than those with persistent antibodies. Bortezomib, a selective inhibitor of the 26S proteosome that causes plasma cell apoptosis, is a new therapy that appears useful in the reversal of alloantibody-mediated rejection in renal transplant recipients.120 Its use in lung transplantation has been described in one case report.121\n",

Alloreactive T-lymphocytes, responding directly or indirectly to donor antigen, constitute the basis of lung allograft rejection, as diagnosed by well-established histopathological criteria that reflect the severity of perivascular or peribronchial inflammation in the lung allograft. Recent evidence supports a more complex immune response to the allograft with involvement of humoral mechanisms, characterized by circulating antibody to donor HLA and specific patterns of lung injury, occurring in parallel with T-cell-based rejection. Emerging evidence further suggests that the interaction between recipient genetics, immunosuppression therapies, and allograft environmental exposures, including pulmonary infection, contributes to high rejection rates after lung transplantation. A greater understanding of the heterogeneous mechanisms of lung rejection is critical to developing effective therapies that target the precise pathophysiology of the disease and ultimately improve long-term lung transplant outcomes.",
