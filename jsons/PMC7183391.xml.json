These challenging times highlight that the traditional concept of a geographically isolated ICU may be less important than strategies to target resources to critically ill patients, wherever critical illness occurs. This concept of an \u201cICU without walls\u201d is not new [2], but it seeks to maximize opportunities to treat critically ill patients through ICU-convertible beds, flexible allocation of lifesaving resources, and expansion of the critical care specialty outside of the ICU and throughout the hospital.",

The decision to reduce the number of beds within an intensive care unit (ICU) can have major implications for patients, clinicians, and hospitals.

The abundance of ICU beds has led to indiscriminate use of ICU care\u2014where critically ill and non-critically ill patients are granted ICU access in a first-come, first-served model until ICU beds become limited.
