The smallest, \u03b8-defensins, are circular peptides that contain 18 residues, \u03b1-defensins have between 29 and 35 residues, and \u03b2-defensins have up to 45 (\nFig. 6.1\n). To date, more than 100 \u03b1-defensin, \u03b2-defensin, and \u03b8-defensin molecules have been reported, and humans express six different \u03b1-defensins and at least four \u03b2-defensins. Additional human defensin/defensinlike genes exist in five different chromosomal loci, but their expression and properties remain to be characterized. \u03b1-Defensins occur in the neutrophils of humans, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters, but not in those of mice, horses, pigs, and sheep. Although the small intestinal Paneth cells of mice express at least 6 (Ouellette et al. 2000; Selsted et al. 1992) and possibly as many as 20 \u03b1-defensins (Ouellette and Selsted 1996), only two very dissimilar defensin species are found in human Paneth cells (Mallow et al. 1996). Two atypical \u03b1-defensins exist in rabbit kidney, but their functions remain uncertain (Bateman et al. 1996; Wu et al. 1998). Thus far, with the exception of rabbit alveolar macrophages, mononuclear phagocytes are not known to produce appreciable amounts of \u03b1-defensins.",

HBD-2, originally recovered from psoriatic skin (Harder et al. 1997), is induced in various epithelia by inflammatory signals. In the epidermis, it is present in very low amounts unless induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Liu et al. 2003). The HBD-3 gene was found by genomic searching (Jia et al. 2001) and the corresponding peptide was isolated from psoriatic skin (Harder et al. 2001). HBD-4 is highly expressed in the testis (epididymis) and less abundantly in the gastric antrum (Garcia et al. 2001b). Since about 50 different \u03b2-defensin genes have been identified in the mouse (Scheetz et al. 2002), sorting out their functions and relationships to human biology is unlikely to be a simple task.",

The highly conserved Arg6 and Glu14 residues form a salt bridge spanning the only non\u2013\u03b2-sheet portion of the molecule and the invariant glycine24 occupies the third position of a Type I turn. HNP-3 crystallizes as a dimer that configures a six-stranded \u03b2-sheet stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. That the invariant glycine18 is located at the dimer interface suggests that dimer formation may be an essential element of defensin-mediated activity. A dimer of the human \u03b1-defensin HNP-3 is illustrated in Figure 6.2\n.",

It is noteworthy that a similarly positioned helical region exists in the defensinlike antimicrobial peptides of insects and plants (e.g., wheat purothionine). The solution structures reported for HBDs 1, 2, and 3 show them to have similar tertiary structures, with a short helical segment preceding a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (Schibli et al. 2002).

The myeloid \u03b1-defensin (DEFA) genes have similar layouts, with three exons that correspond approximately to the 5\u2032-untranslated region, signal sequence/propiece, and mature defensin region (Linzmeier et al. 1993). The genes for HD-5 and 6, \u03b1-defensins expressed predominantly within the human intestine, have only two exons as do the DEFB genes that encode \u03b2-defensins, suggesting that the evolution of \u03b1-defensins involved both deletional and insertional events. Although dissimilar in their genomic sequence, the genes for HD-5 and HD-6 show considerable sequence similarity in their proximal 5\u2032-flanking regions, which presumably contain elements involved in their tissue-specific expression (Mallow et al. 1996; Salzman et al. 2003). The DEFA genes encoding human myeloid and enteric \u03b1-defensins are clustered on human chromosome 8 (Linzmeier et al. 1999). The human DEFB genes that encode HBD-1, HDB-2, and HDB-3 contain two exons and are all within a few hundred kilobases from the myeloid \u03b1-defensin locus on chromosome 8p23 (Liu et al. 1997; Peng et al. 2001). This region is also home to a DEFT pseudogene that is highly homologous to the genes encoding the \u03b1-defensins of rhesus monkeys. \u03b8-defensin (DEFT) genes evidently arose in an Old World monkey when the mutation of a preexisting \u03b1-defensin gene placed a premature stop codon within Exon 3 of a DEFA gene. Additional defensin and defensinlike genes have been identified in four other chromosomal loci, but their tissue expression and biology remain to be characterized (Schutte et al. 2002).",

Especially with human defensins, such permeabilization is prevented by treatments that inhibit the target cell's metabolism, growth, or transmembrane protonmotive force (Lehrer et al. 1989a). Defensins permeabilize artificial phospholipid membranes only when a transmembrane electronmotive force of sufficient magnitude and correct polarity is applied (Kagan et al. 1990). Membrane conductance increases as the second to fourth power of the defensin concentration, suggesting that two to four defensin molecules interact to form a channel in this system. Wimley and associates (Wimley et al. 1994) examined interactions between human defensins and lipid bilayers. They found that HNP-2 (net charge, +3) bound to and permeabilized unilamellar vesicles composed of anionic phospholipids, but not those formed of electroneutral phospholipids. Data from experiments with entrapped markers of different sizes suggested that multimeric HNP-2 formed aqueous pores with a maximum diameter of \u223c25 \u00c5. If such pores formed in bacterial membranes, they should allow passage of defensin monomers and even dimers (\u223c26 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 15 \u00c5) to more interior sites.",

What can make bacteria resistant has been partially explained by identifying mutations that increase bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial peptides. Studies on the intracellular enteric pathogen S. typhimurium revealed the importance of the two-component regulatory system, PhoP/PhoQ. PhoQ is a magnesium-binding sensor kinase that responds to ionic and other environmental changes by phosphorylating PhoP, a DNA-binding protein that can activate numerous genes, including some needed for resistance to antimicrobial peptides and intracellular survival (Miller et al. 1990; Chamnongpol et al. 2003). These include important aspects of LPS structure (Ernst et al. 2001), and expression of an outer membrane protease that cleaves, and presumably inactivates, certain antimicrobial peptides (Guina et al. 2000).",

Insertion of defensins into microbial membranes is assisted by their positive charge and by the target cell's transmembrane potential.

Defensin molecules bound to mammalian target cells with biphasic kinetics, similar to those with Candida albicans. K562 cells exposed to 20 \u03bcg/ml of radiolabeled HNP-1 bound approximately 4.3 \u00d7 109 defensin molecules per cell. This initial binding did not cause cytolysis and was comparable in defensin-resistant and defensin-sensitive target cells. After 5 to 10 minutes, sensitive targets became permeable to trypan blue (molecular weight = 960 Da) and manifested enhanced transmembrane ion flux. Membrane-bound defensin molecules became progressively more difficult to dislodge by adding serum, and after 3 to 4 hours, the cells began releasing 51Cr-labeled cytoplasmic components. Strand breaks and adenosine triphosphate\u2013ribosylation (ADP-ribosylation) were first detected in K562 and Raji targets 6\u20138 hours after incubation with HNP, and these increased to maximal levels by 18 hours. DNA was not degraded into nucleosome-sized fragments. Other experiments suggested that the initial defensin-induced pores were voltage dependent and that defensin-mediated injury to mammalian cells depended on an energized target cell membrane. Since defensins are bound by \u03b12-macroglobulin and other normal serum components, it is not surprising that defensins were minimally, if at all, cytotoxic in the presence of serum. Whether and where defensins are cytotoxic in vivo is not known.",

Human neutrophil defensins are chemotactic for human monocytes (Territo et al. 1989), T-cells (Chertov et al. 1996), and immature dendritic cells (Yang et al. 2000) in vitro, so that their release from neutrophils could provide a signal to mobilize immunocompetent mononuclear cells. Defensins also induce the synthesis of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a C-X-C cytokine, by human airway epithelial cells, possibly providing a mechanism to recruit additional neutrophils to sites of inflammation (Van Wetering et al. 1997). The \u03b1-defensins of human neutrophils were shown to act as adjuvants to enhance systemic IgG antibody response (Lillard et al. 1999). Murine \u03b2-defensin MBD-2 acted as an adjuvant for tumor immunization, by providing a costimulatory signal via the toll-like receptor 4 (Biragyn et al. 2002). It is not yet clear whether these activities are shared by other defensins.",

These subtypes can be distinguished by buoyant density, when they are made during the neutrophil's maturation, their response to secretagogues, and their composition. About 30% to 50% of the protein content of the azurophil granules consists of defensins. Relatively small amounts of defensins are released extracellularly after phagocytosis or secretagogue exposure, as the peptides are preferentially delivered phagosomes that contain opsonized bacteria (Joiner et al. 1989). This targeted delivery of defensins not only places them where they are most needed, but it also helps minimize any potential cytotoxicity to host tissues. The high concentrations of defensins in human neutrophils are not unique: \u03b1-defensins are similarly plentiful in the granules of rabbit neutrophils (\u223c10\u201315 \u03bcg/million cells) and rabbit alveolar macrophages (\u223c2 \u03bcg/million cells).

In humans, the orthologous small intestine \u03b1-defensins are processed to mature peptides during or after secretion into the small intestinal lumen by the serine protease trypsin (Ghosh et al. 2002). In both species, the proteases mediating this \u03b1-defensin processing are expressed by Paneth cells.",

The mice had increased susceptibility to intestinal infections with gram-negative organisms (Wilson et al. 1999). Detailed analysis of secretions from the isolated crypts of normal and matrilysin-deficient mice indicated that the antimicrobial activity of crypt secretions was largely the result of defensins and that it was greatly impaired in matrilysin-deficient mice (Ayabe et al. 2000).",

Sequence analysis revealed similarity of this molecule to defensins expressed in leukocytes and to its designation as the first epithelial \u03b2-defensin. TAP expression was found in the pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells of conducting airway and nasal mucosa (Diamond et al. 1993). A hallmark of TAP expression, like several more recently described epithelial \u03b2-defensins of humans and mice, is inducible expression in response to bacterial LPS and some inflammatory cytokines (Diamond et al. 1996; Russell et al. 1996; Diamond et al. 2000). A canonical NF-\u03baB recognition site in the 5\u2032-flanking region of the TAP gene was important in the transcriptional regulation of this gene by bacterial products (Diamond et al. 2000). In vivo inoculation of pathogenic bacteria into the bovine lung caused a rapid and dramatic increase in \u03b2-defensin expression in the conducting airway epithelium, which was not seen in the adjacent control lobe (Stolzenberg et al. 1997).",

PLA2 is present in granules of human neutrophils and small intestinal Paneth cells. sPLA2 is released from neutrophils exposed to secretagogues, such as phorbol esters or calcium ionophores, and by Paneth cells exposed to cholinergic agonists, bacteria, or LPS. Serum sPLA2 levels are greatly elevated in patients with sepsis and rise sharply within 3 hours after the experimental administration of lipopolysaccharide to uninfected patients. High concentrations of sPLA are also present in human tears. The antimicrobial specialization of this phospholipase is probably a result of its unusually high net positive charge and a cluster of positively charged residues near its N-terminus that facilitate its interaction with bacteria and access to its phospholipid target (Weiss et al. 1991).",

SLPI has received many alternative names, including human seminal plasma inhibitor-I (HUSI-I), cervix uteri secretion inhibitor (CUSI), bronchial secretory inhibitor (BSI), and bronchial mucus inhibitor (MPI). Mice deficient in SLPI show impaired wound healing (Ashcroft et al. 2000; Zhu et al. 2002), but their response to infection has not been reported yet. In vitro, SLPI shows low-level activity against bacteria and fungi (Hiemstra 2002) and may also have anti-HIV activity. If the high concentrations of SLPI in many epithelial secretions compensate for its low intrinsic potency, its antimicrobial activity could be biologically important.",

It is a 55-kDa cationic protein and a member of a family of lipid-binding proteins, two of which, BPI and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) avidly bind to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In vitro, BPI is specifically active against selected gram-negative bacteria at concentrations as low as nanomolar, and this activity is wholly contained in a 25-kDa amino terminal fragment. The mechanism of activity of BPI against bacteria depends on the initial high-affinity interaction with LPS in the outer membrane. The resulting rapid permeabilization of the outer membrane is followed by a slower process that culminates in the disruption of the inner membrane of gram-negative bacteria with attendant loss of viability (Wiese et al. 1997). More recently, BPI was also identified as a component of human eosinophil granules and as a lipoxin-inducible protein in mucosal epithelia (Canny et al. 2002). In vitro studies suggest that BPI contributes to the killing of gram-negative bacteria in isolated epithelia and neutrophils.",

Some of these peptides have amphipathic \u03b1-helical structures, others form compact, defensin-like \u03b2-sheets stabilized by intramolecular cystine disulfide bonds, and still others are remarkably rich in proline, arginine, or tryptophan residues. The genes for cathelicidins contain four exons, the first three of which encode most of the conserved cathelin domain. Exon 4 specifies the last few cathelin residues, including the cleavage site and the mature peptide. The 5\u2032 flanking sequences of this gene family contain motifs for binding NF-\u03baB, IL-6, GM-CSF, and NF-1, suggesting that synthesis responds to mediators generated early during infection.",

For example, the human cathelicidin LL-37 is chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, but not for dendritic cells. This activity is likely mediated through binding to the formyl-peptide receptorlike 1 receptor (De et al. 2000). The proline-rich porcine cathelicidin PR-39 can induce upregulation of syndecans, heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in the repair process at the site of skin wounds (Gallo et al. 1994).",

In vitro, inhibition of neutrophil elastase by specific inhibitors blocked the conversion of proprotegrins to protegrins and largely ablated the stable antimicrobial activity secreted by porcine neutrophils (Shi and Ganz 1998). The application of neutrophil elastase inhibitor to porcine wounds decreased the concentration of mature protegrin in wound fluid and impaired the clearance of bacteria from wounds. The deficit could be restored by supplementing the wound fluid with synthetic protegrin in vitro or in vivo (Cole et al. 2001). Thus protegrins act as natural antibiotics that contribute to the clearance of microbes from wounds.",

CRAMP, normally the main murine cathelicidin (Nizet et al. 2001), is the murine homolog of human hCAP18. In CRAMP-knockout mice, the skin lesions caused by experimental Group A Streptococcus inoculation were larger lesions and had higher numbers of viable bacteria than those seen in control mice. As in pigs, infiltrating neutrophils appeared to be the chief source of cathelicidins in inflamed skin. Epithelial cells also produced cathelicidins, but it is not clear if their production was quantitatively significant. How or if epithelial cathelicidins undergo proteolytic processing remains to be defined.",
