            "text": "Empowered by the ubiquitous access to computer devices and the Internet, an ever-growing amount of digital images has been emerged [25] . In light of this, image retrieval is considered as an active research topic that aims at retrieving relevant images to a user query from a large database of digital images [11, 14, 21, 26] . Until recently, most of the popular search engines (e.g., Flickr) are built upon the textual information associated with images [4, 7, 24] . Nevertheless, they cannot comprehensively describe the rich content of images since they totally ignore the visual information [10] . Besides, they suffer from the fact that the textual information is often noisy, ambiguous and language-dependent [8, 12] . As a consequence, the retrieved results may be noisy and irrelevant which may affect the retrieval performance [17, 24] . To tackle those issues, visual reranking has been introduced to refine the text-based retrieval results using the visual information [4, 19, 32, 35] . Namely, it attempts to boost the rank of relevant images with respect to the textual query [24] . Recently, the hypergraph learning has been widely used in many applications for its capability in capturing complex relationships among samples [4, 15, 23] . In case of visual re-ranking, the textual results are taken as vertices and the re-ranking problem is formulated as a transductive learning on the hypergraph [2, 9] . The potential of the hypergraph learning is essentially determined by the hypergraph construction scheme [22] . Most of previous hypergraph learning methods adopt a neighborhood-based strategy to build the hypergraph, in which textual results are taken as vertices and each vertex is linked to its k nearest neighbors by an hyperedge. While obvious, this method suffers from the following drawbacks: (1) it is sensitive to noise (2) lacks the ability to discover the real neighborhood structure (3) the parameter k is fixed as global parameter for all samples regardless their local data distribution. To tackle those issues, recent works have proposed to leverage the regularized regression models, namely the sparse representation and the ridge regression for hypergraph construction [22] . Compared to the neighborhood-based hypergraph, the sparse hypergraph achieves superior performance in revealing the local data structure and handling the noisy data. However, it cannot discover related samples to one hyperedge centroid as thoroughly as possible. Moreover, the sparse constraint makes the hypergraph construction very expensive [41] . Recently, the ridge regression has gained considerable attention not only for its effectiveness in data representation but also for its computational efficiency [41] . In contrast to sparse representation which aims at encouraging the competition between samples to represent a datum, the ridge regression attempt to include all samples in the representation process. That's why this framework is often called the collaborative representation. Owing to these desirable properties, in this paper, we put a particular emphasis on the collaborative representation and we propose an adaptive collaborative hypergraph learning for visual re-ranking. The proposed data representation technique adaptively preserve the locality structure and discard irrelevant/outlier samples with respect to a test sample by integrating a distance-regularizer on the representation coefficients. At the feature level, we impose a weight matrix on the representation errors to adaptively highlight the important features and reduce the effect of redundant/noisy ones. Moreover, to enhance the representation interpretability, a nonnegativity constraint is added in such a way that the representation coefficients can directly reveal the similarity among samples. This way, we obtain a more informative and quality hypergraph which not only captures the grouping information but also reveal the local neighborhood structure and exhibit more discriminative power and robustness to noisy data. Extensive experiments on the public MediaEval benchmarks demonstrate that our re-ranking method achieves consistently superior results, compared to state of-the-art methods.",

            "text": "In recent years, many visual re-ranking methods have been proposed in the literature. According to the statistical analysis model used, they could be classified as supervised and unsupervised methods. The former cast the re-ranking to a classification problem that aims at separating relevant from irrelevant images using data from the initial results as training samples. For instance, authors in [30] built a supervised classification model using expert annotations to assign a relevance score to each image. The latter assumes that relevant samples are probably to be close to each other than to irrelevant ones. It aims at discovering and mining patterns using pair-wise similarities. Clearly, there are two paramount ways. The first is to leverage clustering to group images with respect to their visual closeness. For instance, a Hierarchical Clustering is applied in [1] and [29] to cluster samples by relevance. Authors in [28] apply a graph-based clustering method where a similarity graph is initially built to represent relationships among images. The second way is to adopt the graph-based learning for its effectiveness in modeling the intrinsic structure within data. VisualRank proposed by Jing and Baluja [20] is the most popular graph-based re-ranking method. It applies a random walk on an affinity graph where images are taken as nodes and their visual similarities as probabilistic hyper-links. In [39] , a manifold ranking process is applied over the data manifold, with the aim of naturally finding the most relevant images. Although promising results are achieved, how to represent complex and high-order relationships hidden in data still the performance bottleneck for graph-based re-ranking. As a generalization of the graph learning, the hypergraph learning is receiving increasing attention in recent years owing to its ability in modeling complex data structure in a more flexible and elegant way [3, 23] . Considering the visual re-ranking, the hypergraph learning is widely used for relevance estimation. For instance, in [2] , authors construct a k-nearest neighbor graphs based on the visual similarity between images. Then, a hypergraph ranking is performed to learn the images' relevance scores. Although efficient, this method suffers from some drawbacks. First, the neighborhood strategy cannot capture the local data distribution of each datum since it uses a fixed number of neighbors k for all samples [35] . Second, the neighborhood strategy is very sensitive to noisy data due to the use of the Euclidean distance as similarity measure [22, 37] . To address those limitations, some researchers have proposed to exploit the regression models for data representation. The most widely used model is the sparse representation (SR) in which each sample is represented as a linear combination of the remaining samples [15, 36] . Compared to the neighborhood-based hypergraph, the sparse hypergraph achieves superior performance in revealing the local data structure and handling the noisy data. However, it cannot discover related samples to one hyperedge centroid as thoroughly as possible. Moreover, the sparse constraint makes the hypergraph construction very expensive.",

Clearly, the most computationally-demanding step in the ADMM-based Optimization is the step 4 which includes matrix multiplication and matrix inverse operations. It costs O(N 3 ) for N \u00d7 N matrix. Fortunately, the term X T X + I \u22121 can be pre-calculated before the iteration loop since it is independent from all variables and. The first two steps are efficiently calculated since they can be considered as element-wise operations. The third step mainly involves matrix addition operation. Hence, their computational complexities can be ignored compared to the fourth step.",

For examples, at a cut-off point X = 20, the precision gains of ACR-HG over Flickr are 6.67%, 8.29%, 10.07% and 6.49% on Landmark-30, Landmark-123, General-65 and General-70 respectively. Second, our method almost always outperforms other methods on all databases.

The experimental results also reveal that, the relevance of retrieval results is higher for landmarks queries compared to complex queries. One explanation is that, non -relevant images were likely to be arisen when the query is ambiguous or involve multiple topics. For example, the query 'baby in stroller' may give rise to images that contain an empty stroller. Another interesting observations, is that the retrieval performance is degraded for some queries (e.g. 'baby in stroller').

At the core of our method is the data representation. Particularly, we proposed a novel representation technique called adaptive collaborative representation to build a more informative hypergraph. By constraining the self-representation term with an weighted matrix, the effect of those redundant and useless features can be adaptively minimized so that a more robust hypergraph can be constructed. In addition, our data representation technique has the advantage of simultaneously capturing both global and local structures of data during hypergraph learning by introducing a locality-preserving term. Based on the obtained representation matrix, we showed how to generate consistent hyperedge connections and hyperedge weights. Finally, a transductive learning is successfully performed upon the constructed hypergraph to learn the images' relevance scores. Experimental results performed on public MediaEval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistently superior results compared to state-of-the art re-ranking methods.",
