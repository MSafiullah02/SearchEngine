The most abundant phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). DPPC is the main component of surfactant that reduces surface tension. The other lipid components of the surfactant are phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and cholesterol, which facilitate the adsorption of DPPC with the help of hydrophobic surfactant proteins [2] . In addition to lipids, there are four surfactant proteins (SPs) expressed by respiratory epithelial cells, designated as SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. Out of these, SP-A and SP-D are large glycosylated water-soluble proteins and members of the calciumdependent carbohydrate-binding collectin family, which have a role in the host defence of the lung. SP-A is also important in the organization and function of the surfactant complex regulating surfactant recycling and secretion. While, SP-B and SP-C are highly hydrophobic small peptides that confer surface tension-lowering properties and are important for the adsorption and spreading of the surfactant.",

After exocytosis of lamellar bodies, surfactant phospholipids, in the presence of SP-A, SP-B and Ca ~+, are organized into a lattice structure called tubular myelin (TM), which forms a lipid-rich layer at the airliquid interface of the alveolus. Most of the extracellular surfactant is taken up by type II cells, catabolized and transported into lamellar bodies for recycling [2] (Figure 1 ).",

To counteract the vulnerability of lungs, the protective immune mechanisms are also located locally in the lungs to facilitate clearance of pathogens and to modulate inflammatory responses. SP-A and SP-D have recently been identified as participants of host defense mechanism against infection and inflammation [3] . These are the members of collectin protein family, which have an Nterminal collagen-like region and a C-terminal lectin domain, which binds carbohydrates in a calcium dependent manner (Figure 2 ). These C-type lectin domains are arrayed with spatial orientation that confers unique carbohydrate specificities, and their preferential binding sites for nonhost oligosaccharides, such as those found on bacterial and viral surfaces [3] . The possible involvement of pulmonary surfactant in the pathophysiology of obstructive lung diseases with a predominant disturbance in the conducting airways, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia has only recently been addressed. Models of airway closure suggest a theoretical use of surfactant in asthma, and clinical studies have suggested that surfactant from asthmatics is functionally impaired. The main mechanism of such impairment appears to be the influx of inhibitory proteins into the airways. Also, products of inflammatory cells (including proteases and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) and airway edema may also contribute to surfactant dysfunction. SP-A being critical for host defence against pathogens, any structure-function abnormality in this renders the CF subjects susceptible to respiratory infections. In a separate study, the BAL fluid recovered from patients with pneumonia showed reduced levels of PC, PG and alterations in fatty acid composition. In addition, amount of SP-A is also decreased and surfactant function is impaired.",
