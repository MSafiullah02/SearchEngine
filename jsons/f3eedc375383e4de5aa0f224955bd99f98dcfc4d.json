Currently, there is no specific treatment available for this disease and off-label investigations of many FDA-approved therapeutics, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab, in an effort to demonstrate improved outcomes, are ongoing. Here, we discuss the current literature describing known contributions of IL-17 to COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and present arguments why anti-IL-17 therapy in COVID-19 should be considered.",

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV cause high mortality, most often resulting from progressive inflammatory viral pneumonia that clinically culminates in ARDS 1 . COVID-19 seems to follow a similar pattern, with 81% of fatal cases diagnosed with ARDS 2 . In consideration of this, a recent correspondence in The Lancet suggests that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyper-inflammation in order to identify those who would benefit from targeted immunosuppression or immunomodulation to prevent acute lung injury (ALI) 3 .",

Its predominant role seems to be dependent on where the cytokine is expressed (gut, lung or skin) and what the precipitating trigger is. These two factors appear to influence whether the prevailing effect of its expression is protective or whether it leads to a detrimental hyper-inflammatory state. Demonstrating the protective effects, mice lacking functional IL-17 receptor (Il17ra \u2212/\u2212 ) signalling were shown to be more susceptible than wild-type mice to secondary pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus following infection with influenza A 4 . However, influenza A challenge of Il17ra \u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in less histological inflammation of the lungs and lower mortality than wild-type mice, revealing the mixed immunopathological effects 5 . For MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the severity of disease was shown to positively correlate with levels of IL-17 and other T helper 17 (T H 17) cell-related pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, TNF and IFN\u03b3 1,6 .",

Dysregulation of T H 17 cells and production of IL-17 in the skin, synovial space and endothelium promote the production of downstream pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF and IL-6 and neutrophil chemoattractants such as IL-8, CCL20 and CCL2. Recruited neutrophils then produce IL-6 and reactive oxygen species, leading to characteristic skin lesions and joint destruction. A hallmark feature of psoriasis, especially the pustular form, is the accumulation of neutrophilic pustules and neutrophilic debris in the epidermis.",

Similar T H 1-type and T H 17-type pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles are observed in patients with MERS and in patients with COVID-19, including elevated IL-17 (REFS 1,6 ) . In a small sample of patients with COVID-19, the elevation of IL-17 in addition to 14 other distinct cytokines was positively correlated with an increased Murray score for lung injury. Assessing the performance of this cytokine as a biomarker of disease, IL-17 had an area under the receiver operating curve score of 0.926, indicating a very good ability to distinguish between severe and mild COVID-19 cases 6 . Taken together, these analyses of patients with coronavirus-induced lung disease suggest that IL-17 can serve as both a biomarker of disease severity and a potential target of therapy to mitigate the damage of SARS-CoV-2, particularly to the lung.",
