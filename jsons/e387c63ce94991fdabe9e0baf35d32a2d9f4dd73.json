            "text": "Control of the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires accurate laboratory testing to identify infected individuals, while also clearing essential staff to continue work. At the current time a number of RT-PCR tests have been developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple regions in the viral genome. In comparison to other RNA viruses the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, however given the large number of transmission chains it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for mutations that might compromise these tests. Here we report the identification of a C-to-T transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome which is associated with failure of the cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 E-gene assay. This variant was detected in four health care workers from the same team. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all four to carry genetically identical viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently on three occasions. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of SNPs which might adversely affect the RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that two regions in the SARS-CoV-2 should be targeted in RT-PCRs to avoid false negatives.",

As of the 18th of April 2020, over 2 million confirmed cases and more than 148,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [4] . Metagenomic RNA sequencing revealed that COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [2] , coronaviruses which have both been responsible for large outbreaks of respiratory illness within the last two decades [5, 6] . The release of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence on the 10th of January spurred the development of RT-PCR assays [7] [8] [9] and thereby enabled reliable laboratory diagnosis of infections. In addition, protocols were also developed to allow for rapid sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [10] , sharing of the resultant data [11] and phylogenetic analysis [12] .",

In the context of SARS-CoV-2, with its high transmissibility [14] , false negatives could have particularly adverse effects on efforts to control its spread. As RT-PCR oligos rely on binding to small ~20bp sequences, mutations in these regions have the potential to generate false negative results through impaired amplification or probe binding. In contrast to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have a moderate mutation rate due their ability to carry out RNA proofreading [15] .
