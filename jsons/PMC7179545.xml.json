Although the external morphology of the virion is well defined, little is known about the internal organization of the particle. Apostolov et al. [9] reported evidence of a threadlike internal structure in thin sections of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) but, as yet, there are no confirmatory data from negative staining or from isolation of internal structures. In fact, there is little agreement as to how the nucleic acid is packaged within the envelope; several interpretations of structure have been advanced based upon data from different laboratories [10].",

The virus was found to be quite stable when stored as a frozen infected monolayer, but loss of liter was inevitable during purification procedures. Batch preparations were routinely monitored by electron microscopy, and virions with typical coronavirus morphology were found in fresh preparations (fig. 1A). However, after the purified preparations in 0.001 m phosphate buffer had been stored overnight at 4\u00b0, fewer typical virions were evident, and disrupted or disintegrating forms were seen (fig. 1 B). Many particles appeared to have lost only their petal-like projections (peplomers). but in addition there were discrete tangles of threadlike strands which were 8-9 nm in width and appeared to be continuous. The possibility that these strands might be released internal component is supported by figure 1C, in which the same strands appear to be released from a collapsing virion. This was the first morphological evidence of a linear RNP-like internal structure of a coronavirus, and further studies were aimed at its isolation and characterization.",

HCV/229E labelled with 3H-uridine was centrifuged in sucrose gradients at 63,000 g for 90 min and samples were collected and assayed by liquid scintillation counting. As can be seen in figure 2, the major peak of 3H-radioactivity was found in fraction 14, coinciding exactly with the peak of virus infectivity. Plaque assays of aliquots from the gradient fractions revealed that approximately 75% of the virus was recovered in five of the 3H-peak fractions. Since distribution of infectivity coincided with the uridine label, this indicates that 3H-uridine was incorporated into the RNA of the virion. Examination of these fractions by electron microscopy revealed some membranous debris in addition to typical coronavirions. Further purification by isopycnic centrifugation resulted in two visible bands, and in one (density 1.19), typical virions were again found to be associated with the peak of 3H-uridine activity [unpublished results].",

In preliminary experiments, the resulting material was immediately layered onto 15-35% w/w sucrose gradients containing Tris/EDTA buffer and DTT above a 65% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 110,000 g for 90 min. Untreated 3H-labelled HCV/229E was centrifuged in parallel. Analysis of the resulting fractions revealed no difference in the distribution of 3H-activity of either the untreated or the NP-40-trcated virus, and in both cases, only a single major peak was revealed which had sedimented through three-fifths of the gradients. Because we were confident that virus had been disrupted, judging by EM monitoring it was concluded that rate-zonal centrifugation under these conditions was not appropriate to resolve these components and that not only was a steeper gradient required, but centrifugation should be carried out to equilibrium. Consequently, NP-40-treated 3H-labelled and control, untreated 3H-labelled HCV/229E preparations were layered onto 25-75% w/w sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 170,000 g for 16-22 h at 10\u00b0. As shown in figure 3, untreated virus peaks were located at the sucrose concentration corresponding to a density of 1.19, whereas NP-40-trcatcd radioactive peaks occurred at a density of 1.27. The former density (1.19) corresponds to equilibrium densities reported for intact coronaviruses [8], while the latter (1.27) falls within the range of values reported for nucleoproteins isolated from a human coronavirus [8] as well as for several of the large RNA viruses [6]. Calculations revealed that 75% of the 3H-uridine label was regularly recovered in this peak.",

We do not regard the lightly coiled appearance seen in one of our preparations as conclusive: however, suggestions of coiling have been seen in other preparations and it is possible that the nucleocapsid exists as a coiled structure within the virion. The diameter of the strand we have seen is similar to that reported by Apostolov el al.
