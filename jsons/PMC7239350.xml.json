In the face of this alarming situation created by the outbreak of COVID-19, the vast majority of the interventional radiology (IR) interventional suites have altered their usual work following the instructions of the national and local health authorities. Among many Interventional Radiologists (IRs), there is a special concern regarding the protocols of management in diagnosed COVID-19-patients, and especially in those cases that are unconfirmed or are suspected [5]. It is important to emphasize that the infection of COVID-19 in health workers is as high as 15% (more than 12,298) in Spain [6]. The government for the first time recognizes the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and FFP2/FFP3 masks.",

These circumstances present high-risk inpatient or outpatient care, especially in the face of a possible forced quarantine of any IR staff who has been infected. There are many general rules and regulations that are constantly being disclosed in the hospitals; however, IRs and the interventional suites have some peculiarities that are not always considered. The three most important difficulties are the following: the scarce number of IRs to work in normal shifts (an average in Spain of 3.41 IRs per hospital), but also their availability during 24 h and 7 days a week on-call coverage [7, 8]; the lack of PPE and FFP2/FFP3 masks; and interventional suites with multiple devices and equipment that have difficulty in sterilizing or preventing fomite transmission.",

Elective procedures must be postponed (Table 1). It is important to consider that in IR departments, more than 40% of their activity corresponds to oncological patients. For this reason, in each oncological case, their priority and the possibility of delayed treatment for a limited period of time should be agreed upon in a multidisciplinary way. The patient whose treatment can be delayed will be properly informed of the exceptional circumstances, as well as the risk/benefit of being admitted to the hospital.",
