Unfortunately, in Italy we are experiencing the 11 same difficulties in terms of surgical and educational 12 planning. At present, we can run the operating theatres 13 in our institution for <10% of the usual activity level and 14 residents are experiencing a temporary lack of teaching 15 caused by both postponement of rotations and the 16 reduction in clinical and surgical activity. Surgical theatres 17 for emergency and urgent cases are guaranteed, while 18 elective cases have been scaled down according to 19 recommendations [2-4] and common sense. However, we 20 are surprisingly experiencing a huge decrease in urgent 21 urological cases presenting to the emergency department. 22 Italy has experienced exponential growth in COVID-19 23 cases from the end of January 2020 until the lockdown 24 imposed by the government on March 9, 2020. We reviewed 25 all urological consultations in the emergency department 26 over the last 60 d and divided them into three groups: group 27 A, from January 29 to February 17; group B, from February 28 18 to March 8; and group C, from March 9 to March 29 28. Group A comprised 63 patients (3.15 patients/d), group B 30 38 (1.9 patients/d), and group C only 17 (0.85 patients/d).",

While it is reasonable to expect 36 that lockdown and quarantine might decrease the number 37 of case presentations for some reasons such as urological 38 trauma, urological infections, and related conditions (eg, 39 acute urinary retention), it is more difficult to understand a 40 huge decrease in presentations for renal colic.",

Moreover, this attitude 47 could lead to future consultation requests from the same 48 patients in worse clinical conditions with further overload 49 of the health care system. 50 A similar scenario has been confirmed by many 51 urologists in different hospitals in northern Italy. It would 52 be of interest to know if the authors also noticed this trend 53 in Singapore and if this is being experienced in other 54 countries, to better understand the underlying reasons and 55 plan adequate management strategies. 56 Conflicts of interest: The authors have nothing to disclose.
