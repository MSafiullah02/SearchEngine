Modified membranes harbouring viral replication complexes (RCs) frequently integrate into a complex structure known as the \u2018viral factory\u2019 where the cytoskeleton participates, cell organelles are recruited and the different steps of the virus life cycle are sequentially connected. Characterizing how this happens would help to understand how viral factors take control of cells and modify their architecture. There is no description of the mechanisms involved in the formation of most viral factories, although there is evidence that some viruses induce aggresomes and autophagosomes to generate sites of replication (Novoa et al., 2005a; Wileman, 2006). Expression of early proteins such as viral polymerases is probably sufficient to program the cell for organelle recruitment and factory formation, as recently observed in cells transfected with rubella virus replicons (Fontana et al., 2007).",

Some viruses, e.g. polioviruses, induce proliferation of specific membranes creating a \u2018novel compartment\u2019 (Cherry et al., 2006) where the viral RNA polymerase molecules can assemble bidimensional arrays (Hobson et al., 2001; Lyle et al., 2002). Although the purpose of this targeted localization has not been elucidated, one possibility is that association of RCs with membranes provides a structural framework for efficient replication and transfer of replicated RNA to assembly sites in contiguous membranes.",

            "text": "Bunyaviruses comprise a large family of RNA enveloped viruses that includes serious emergent pathogens for humans, animals and plants, and are responsible for severe episodes of encephalitis and haemorrhagic fevers in humans (Elliott, 1997). They assemble a large factory involving the Golgi complex where virus particles bud and mature (Salanueva et al., 2003; Novoa et al., 2005b). Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) serves as a model for the many pathogens within this family. It contains three RNA segments of negative\u2010sense polarity. The large segment (L) codes for an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), the medium segment (M) codes for a precursor polyprotein (NH2\u2010Gn\u2010NSm\u2010Gc\u2010COOH), which is cotranslationally cleaved to yield the two virion glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a non\u2010structural protein called NSm, and the smallest segment (S) codes for the nucleoprotein N and a second non\u2010structural protein NSs in overlapping reading frames (Elliott, 1990). The NH2\u2010terminal domain of NSm is essential for BUNV morphogenesis (Shi et al., 2006) while NSs is a non\u2010essential protein that contributes to viral pathogenesis (Bridgen et al., 2001). There is no ultrastructural description of the bunyavirus replication site that has been defined as \u2018cytoplasmic\u2019 (Nichol et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Morphogenesis of coronaviruses, arteriviruses, rubiviruses and bunyaviruses is associated to the Golgi complex. The choice of the Golgi for viral replication or assembly is somehow surprising. The Golgi is a highly dynamic organelle whose function requires continual membrane and protein flow (James Morre and Mollenhauer, 2007). On the other hand, the Golgi may be an autonomous organelle with a stable framework (Seemann et al., 2000). Its unique architecture is thought to depend on cytoplasmic matrix proteins and the cytoskeleton. Actin seems to participate in the preservation of the flattened shape of Golgi cisternae (Lazaro\u2010Dieguez et al., 2006) and several actin\u2010binding proteins are known to play some role in Golgi function. These include myosins and spectrins (Beck, 2005).",

In a previous study we observed that Golgi stacks contain peculiar virus\u2010induced tubular structures in BUNV\u2010infected cells (Salanueva et al., 2003). With the help of three\u2010dimensional reconstructions and molecular mapping in situ and in vitro we have characterized these tubular elements and discovered that they represent a new structure of viral and cellular origin. Tubes assemble in Golgi stacks where they seem to be involved in multiple functions including viral genome replication, transfer of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes to assembly sites and viral morphogenesis. We propose that this new multifunctional structure associates with the actin\u2010containing matrix of the Golgi stacks providing a stable scaffold for viral replication and early morphogenesis.",

Control monolayers (Fig. 1A) showed round\u2010shaped nuclei (blue), perinuclear Golgi elements (red) and well\u2010defined straight actin stress fibres (green). Infected cells (Fig. 1B) have a completely different aspect: nuclei are elongated, the Golgi is rounded and concentrates on one side of the nucleus, and stress fibres have moved to the cell periphery. No changes in microtubules or vimentin filaments were observed (not shown). In addition to the WGA trans\u2010Golgi marker shown in Fig. 1A and B, two additional Golgi markers (giantin and galactosyl\u2010transferase or Gal\u2010T) exhibited a similar transition from a perinuclear distribution in non\u2010infected cells (Fig. 1C and D) to a more compact pattern on one side of the nucleus in infected cells (Fig. 1E and F). When observing just nuclei\u2010associated staining a depression was frequently detected, corresponding to the location of the viral factory (Fig. 1G and H). Electron microscopy (EM) showed factories as groups of organelles near the nucleus (Fig. 1I). Higher magnifications showed round\u2010shaped and tubular structures in Golgi stacks (Fig. 1J and K). We have detected these structures in several mammalian cultured cell types that support bunyavirus replication such as BHK\u201021 (this study), Vero (Salanueva et al., 2003) and CHO cells (not shown). Their number was higher early in infection and their viral origin was demonstrated in previous studies (Salanueva et al., 2003). In the present work we have studied a large number of serial sections and discovered that viral tubes actually contain a tubular domain and a bigger globular domain on one of the extremities (Fig. 1L). The tubes are open to the cytoplasm (arrows in Fig. 1K\u2013M).",

            "text": "BUNV generates round\u2010shaped and tubular structures in infected cells whose representative views in thin sections of epoxy resin are summarized in Fig. 2A\u2013H. The Golgi\u2010associated morphogenetic pathway of BUNV and the structural and biochemical characterization of the three viral forms have been previously described in detail (Salanueva et al., 2003; 2005a, 2005b). Global understanding of all these structures has been possible through a careful analysis of consecutive serial sections (see below). Condensation of material in individual Golgi sacculi originates arcs opened to the cytosol (Fig. 2A), elongated globular structures of low internal electron\u2010density (Fig. 2B) and complete viral tubes with both globular and cylindrical domains (Fig. 2C). The two types of cross\u2010sections originated by a viral tube are shown in Fig. 2D and E. Cross\u2010sectioned globular heads are always > 100 nm in diameter and most of these structures have a diameter of 120\u2013150 nm. The cylindrical domain of viral tubes has a cross\u2010section of 80\u2013100 nm in diameter. Virus particles have smaller diameters (Fig. 2F\u2013H). Budding profiles in Golgi membranes generate immature viruses or VI that are released into the lumen of a Golgi sacculus (Fig. 2F). Intermediate intracellular virus or VII exits the Golgi in secretory vesicles (Fig. 2G) and mature extracellular virions or VE are seen in the extracellular environment (Fig. 2H). All three viral forms have a diameter of around 70 nm in thin sections of epoxy resin for ultrastructural studies. In cryosections for immunogold detection of specific components structural details of viral tubes and viruses change (Fig. 2I\u2013L). Diameter of sectioned viruses is around 65 nm while the globular domain of the viral tube is around 100\u2013130 nm. Unequivocal views of the cylindrical domain of viral tubes are not easily obtained in cryosections. Specific labelling with the Golgi marker giantin confirmed that the viral tubes are associated to Golgi stacks (Fig. 2I). Viral polymerase L (Pol) and nucleocapsid N (Nuc) proteins are present in these globular domains as detected by immunogold labelling and EM (Fig. 2J\u2013L). N also accumulates around Golgi membranes (Fig. 2L) while L concentrates in an internal layer of the tube globular domain (Fig. 2K). Double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), an intermediate of RNA replication (Fig. 2M and N) as well as incorporated BrUTP (Fig. 2O and P) locate in the globular domain of viral tubes according to immunogold labelling. These data strongly suggest that the globular domain of viral tubes harbours the BUNV RCs. Confocal microscopy showed RCs attached to recruited mitochondria (Fig. 2Q) and EM shows that tubes contact and sometimes fuse with the external mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2R\u2013T).",

Immunogold and EM showed that NSm localizes both in the cylindrical (Fig. 4A and B) and globular (Fig. 4C) domains of Golgi\u2010associated viral tubes. NSm was detected in Golgi membranes where new virus particles are assembling (Fig. 4D). Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of NSm in isolated viral tubes and intracellular viral intermediates I and II while extracellular mature virions lacked the protein (Fig. 4E). The same result was obtained by immunogold detection of NSm and EM of isolated viruses disrupted in vitro (not shown). This distribution is typical for the behaviour of scaffolding proteins that assist in the assembly of immature viral precursors and are later degraded by proteolysis during maturation (Steven et al., 2005). To obtain functional information about the role of NSm in viral tubes and viral particles three NSm mutants were characterized at the ultrastructural level (Fig. 4F\u2013H). These viruses obtained by a reverse genetics approach have deletions in NSm domains III and IV (Shi et al., 2006). They grow slowly generating maximum virus yields 10\u2010 to 100\u2010fold lower than wild\u2010type BUNV. When studying ultrathin sections of cells infected with NSm\u03944 mutant virus, viral tubes were rarely seen. More than 200 cells infected with wild\u2010type BUNV and an equivalent amount of cells infected with NSm\u03944 mutant virus at 6, 10 and 24 h post infection (p.i.) were studied by oriented serial sectioning. While more than 50 viral tubes per cell were detected when infecting with the wild\u2010type virus, a total of 12 complete tubes (longitudinal sections of the cylindrical domain) were seen in \u223c200 cells infected with the mutant virus. Tubes assembled by the NSm mutant were apparently less rigid than normal, had small heads and exhibited a diameter of 60\u2013100 nm (Fig. 4F). Intracellular immature viral intermediates (type I viruses) accumulated in Golgi membranes which suggests a blockade in viral particle maturation (Fig. 4G). A significant amount of viral glycoproteins was visualized at the plasma membrane by confocal microscopy (not shown) and budding profiles were also frequently seen at the cell surface (Fig. 4H). Similar results were obtained with NSm\u03943 and NSm\u03945 deletion mutants, with small differences in the amount of intracellular virus particles and budding profiles in plasma membrane compared with NSm\u03944 virus (not shown). These data confirmed an active participation of NSm protein in tube structure and virus assembly in Golgi, and pointed to viral tubes as elements involved in viral morphogenesis.",

The highest scores obtained from this study corresponded to cytoskeleton\u2010associated proteins (actin, myosin I and tubulin), several ribosomal proteins, the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 and a retinoblastoma\u2010like protein (Table 1). Considering the filamentous internal structure of the tubes (Fig. 3D), we focused our attention on the cytoskeletal proteins. Confocal microscopy showed that although actin is mostly removed from the viral factory some spots of actin remained in the modified Golgi region (Fig. 5A). Omitting the actin and Golgi\u2010associated signals showed a weak To\u2010Pro blue staining that most probably corresponds to RNA accumulation in the factory (Fig. 5B). When the Golgi signal is omitted, thin filamentous elements of actin are distinguished (Fig. 5C). The dimensions of these filamentous structures are compatible with those of viral tubes as seen by EM. Actin was detected by Western blot in isolated tubes and intracellular viruses while it was absent in extracellular mature virions (Fig. 5D). Actin was also detected by immunogold labelling in tubes and viruses as shown in cryosections of infected cells (Fig. 5E and F) and on isolated tubes (Fig. 5G\u2013I). Intact tubes exhibited a very weak or no immunogold signal (Fig. 5G), while tubes opened with saponin \u2018on grid\u2019 showed an enhanced signal on the released protein aggregates (Fig. 5H and I). An actin\u2010associated signal was also detected on protein aggregates released from intracellular immature viruses disrupted in vitro (not shown). These results confirmed the presence of actin as a component of the internal fibres of viral tubes and its incorporation into immature viruses.",

            "text": "Assembly of viral tubes in Golgi stacks could involve Golgi membrane components or more stable Golgi matrix proteins. To test these possibilities we used brefeldin A (BFA), a drug that induces the rapid fusion of Golgi membrane with pre\u2010Golgi membranes and RER leaving a separated scaffold of matrix components (Seemann et al., 2000). From previous studies we knew that drugs disrupting cis\u2010 and medial\u2010Golgi subcompartments block BUNV replication when added at 0\u20131 h p.i. (Salanueva et al., 2003; Novoa et al., 2005a). Thus, short BFA treatments were applied to already infected BHK\u201021 cells. Drug was added to the cultures at 10 h p.i., followed by immunofluorescence staining for GalT or giantin (Fig. 6A\u2013F). At 15 or 30 min after adding BFA the immunofluorescence signal for GalT, a Golgi membrane enzyme, was rapidly fragmented and dispersed while giantin, a Golgi matrix protein, stayed in the perinuclear location for longer times. Similar effects were seen after just 5 min of treatment (data not shown). Viral tubes deprived of surrounding Golgi membranes had normal globular and cylindrical domains (Fig. 6G\u2013I) and maintained their internal proteinaceous scaffolds and contacts with mitochondria (Fig. 6G). Tubes with apparent connections with cytoplasmic fibres that remind cytoskeletal intermediate filaments were observed (Fig. 6H). Viral tubes with short BFA treatments then exhibited the same behaviour than giantin and remained as distinguishable structures when Golgi stacks have already disappeared.",

Among them, the actin\u2010stabilizing drug Jpk provided the clearest results. LtA and CyD had very little or no effect, respectively, on viral replication and assembly as determined by measurement of infectious viral particles released to the culture supernatants at 6 and 10 h p.i. Complete tubes, virus budding profiles and viral particles assembled in Golgi stacks of cells treated with LtA, as observed in thin sections of treated cells studied by EM (not shown). However, treatment with Jpk led to a decrease in infectious virus release by 60\u201370% in cell cultures that simultaneously lose the actin stress fibres as observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6J and K). EM showed that in cells treated with Jpk cell organelles were displaced to the cell periphery against the plasma membrane (not shown) and Golgi fragments were occasionally distinguished (Fig. 6L). Intact viral tubes were not detected although their globular domains were seen in Golgi remnants (Fig. 6L) and attached to mitochondria (not shown). Viral assembly was massively displaced to the plasma membrane where budding profiles were frequently seen (Fig. 6M). Intracellular budding and viral particles in Golgi remnants were very scarce and observed exclusively in cells less affected by the drug according to characteristic Jpk effects in ultrastructure. Budding profiles were not distinguished at the plasma membrane of normally infected cells where budding events were exclusively located in Golgi stacks, as confirmed by analysis of oriented serial sections covering all planes from each infected cell. At least 200 cells per condition were studied.",

We obtained serial sections of factories for a detailed study of the whole, complex structure. Analysis of all planes provided a much better characterization of factories compared with random planes with a more accurate quantification of numbers and dimensions of viral structures. Most tubes have a total length of 0.2\u20130.5 \u03bcm although tubes longer than 1 \u03bcm were occasionally seen. 3D reconstructions from serial sections were done for early (Fig. 7A\u2013F) and late (Fig. 7G\u2013I) factories. Early factories with few viral particles are round shaped structures near the nucleus and surrounded by mitochondria (Fig. 7A). A close\u2010up of the central areas of this factory showed viral tubes that connect Golgi stacks with RER cisternae (Fig. 7B). The consecutive sections corresponding to these tubes are shown in Fig. 7C. This frequent contact was never detected after random analysis of factories in 2D which points to the importance of covering all the planes of very complex structures in an oriented manner. An important contact previously detected in 2D analysis occurred between tubes and mitochondria (Fig. 7D and E). Careful study of 3D maps revealed that early factories are indeed composed of repetitive units of a basic set integrated by a Golgi stack with mitochondria, RER and one or more viral tubes (Fig. 7F). By contrast, late factories are less compact structures that have abandoned the juxtanuclear location and contain many viral particles (Fig. 7G). Mitochondria and RER do not completely surround the factory and virus particles are moving towards the cell periphery. Physical contacts between viral tubes and new viral particles were detected as shown in the encircled area of Fig. 7G and in Fig. 7H and I. The existence of these contacts supports a role for the viral tubes as the physical connections between viral replication and morphogenesis inside the Golgi stacks of the virus factory as proposed in the model of Fig. 8.",

Although the whole factory is large and complex it is in fact composed of repetitive units constituted by one or more Golgi stacks, mitochondria, RER elements and a tubular structure that acts as a link between these organelles. Further, the tubes could play multiple functions such as transfer of replicated viral genomes to assembly sites. Actin is needed both for assembly of these tubes and for virus morphogenesis in Golgi membranes. The presence of tubular structures in thin sections of mouse brain infected with BUNV was reported in old literature where they were interpreted as elongated virus particles or nucleocapsids (Murphy et al., 1968). We also detected these structures in a previous study (Salanueva et al., 2003) and estimated a discreet number of tubes, 2 or 3, per Golgi stack. Analysis of serial sections has provided us with a much more accurate appreciation of their real numbers, as all planes of the cell are analysed. As a consequence several new data have been obtained: tubes are in fact more abundant (more than 50 in many cells) and frequently connect with mitochondria and RER cisternae. Our structural characterization of viral tubes in Golgi membranes was completed with a molecular mapping of the structures both in situ and in vitro after their purification from infected cells. Identification of viral factors involved in genome replication and morphogenesis as well as cell proteins such as the translation elongation factor 2 or ribosomal proteins suggested that tubes may harbour post\u2010replication events. A functional analysis of how altered NSm sequences or actin integrity affect factory architecture and viral assembly demonstrated that viral NSm protein and Golgi actin are essential for the structure and function of the tubes.",

Immunoprecipitation assays showed that NSm interacts with N protein and the viral glycoproteins in infected cells (Shi et al., 2006). Interestingly, NSm from tospoviruses, the plant\u2010infecting bunyaviruses, is a movement protein associated with transport of RNPs through plamodesmata (Storms et al., 1995). In mammalian cells tube\u2010associated NSm could facilitate the transport of RNPs from the RCs to the assembly sites. Our data suggest that NSm could act also as a \u2018matrix\u2019 protein, facilitating binding of RNPs to the cytosolic domains of viral glycoproteins Gc and Gn in Golgi membranes. In fact its behaviour as a scaffolding protein that assists in viral assembly is supported by its presence in immature viral intermediates and its absence in mature extracellular virions. During tube assembly NSm aggregates seem to grow from the cytosolic side towards the interior of Golgi sacculi creating a new space (Fig. 1K). As in situ labelling experiments showed that actin and giantin are inside viral tubes when they are normally facing the cytosolic side of Golgi membranes, interactions of viral proteins with Golgi actin and matrix proteins could be essential for tube assembly.",

Nevertheless, the Golgi manages to maintain its high degree of structural organization thanks to a large group of Golgi\u2010resident proteins that form a matrix. Various cytoskeletal networks together with coiled\u2010coil proteins of the golgin family, such as the cis\u2010golgins p115, GM130 and giantin, are components of this Golgi matrix (Short et al., 2005) that has been visualized by EM of detergent\u2010extracted Golgi stacks (Fath and Burgess, 1993). Microtubules and associated motor proteins and the actin cytoskeleton are of particular importance in Golgi organization. Accordingly, several myosin motors localize to the organelle, where they are thought to contribute to the formation and transport of Golgi vesicles. Complex molecular machineries regulate actin dynamics involved in transport events in Golgi membranes (Fath et al., 1997; Beck, 2005).",

They use actin for entry, intracellular transport, or cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission (Pelkmans et al., 2002; Fackler and Krausslich, 2006; Radtke et al., 2006). Actin is involved in replication and transcription of both nuclear and cytoplasmic viruses and the infectious particles of retroviruses, herpesviruses, and picornaviruses contain actin (Grunewald et al., 2003; Radtke et al., 2006). When the actin cytoskeleton is destroyed with specific drugs a compaction of the Golgi complex is observed (Lazaro\u2010Dieguez et al., 2006). Curiously, this altered Golgi is very similar to the round\u2010shaped organelle we observed in BUNV factory whose assembly occurs simultaneously with relocation of stress fibres to the cell periphery (Fig. 1). In an attempt to test the potential function of actin in the structure and function of viral tubes we have used three actin\u2010disrupting drugs. Two of them depolymerize filamentous actin (CyD and LtA) while the third one stabilizes filamentous actin (Jpk). Jpk stabilizes actin filaments in vitro, but in vivo it induces polymerization of monomeric actin into amorphous masses enhancing the rate of actin filament nucleation and disordered polymeric actin (Bubb et al., 2000). We used three drugs with different actin binding sites and different mechanisms of action because we wanted to target molecules associated to a very particular structure, the tubes inserted in Golgi stacks. Although we knew that viral tubes are open to the cytosol, we were not sure about efficiency and accessibility of drugs to actin molecules integrated in the tubular structure. In fact, while actin\u2010depolymerizing drugs had little effect on viral tube structure and virus production, the F\u2010actin\u2010stabilizing drug Jpk altered the structure of viral tubes, the location of virus assembly sites and the release of infectious virus particles to the culture supernatants. Golgi\u2010associated actin seems to play a structural role in maintaining the structural integrity of the viral tubes in Golgi membranes.",

Studies on the nature of the Golgi matrix scaffold showed that giantin, GM130, GRASP65 and GRASP55 end up in membranes called BFA remnants that are distinct from the ER (Seemann et al., 2000). These results supported the idea of a pre\u2010existing template for Golgi stacks composed by these and other proteins. By using BFA we wanted to study if viral tubes disappear immediately when Golgi membranes fuse with the ER or if they stay for longer times following a common behaviour with the Golgi matrix scaffold. Like giantin viral tubes resisted short BFA treatments, which suggests they could be bound to the stable scaffold of Golgi stacks. Interestingly, integrity of Golgi actin and viral NSm protein is also important for viral tube structure and normal production of infectious virions. Our working hypothesis is that assembly of these viruses happens in Golgi membranes because replication machinery anchors in Golgi matrix components. A detailed study with silencing experiments and transfections with mutated components will be necessary to determine if particular Golgi matrix components are specifically involved in the organization and activities of viral tubes. Also to explore if myosin I molecules detected in isolated tubes are participating in transport of RNPs from the RCs to the assembly sites in nearby Golgi membranes.",

Tubes represent a new structure that, in communication with the cytosol, would host viral RNA replication and assembly of RNPs in a protective environment, facilitating the posterior transfer of RNPs to the assembly sites. The unusual cylindrical shape of this viral RC\u2010containing structure might be related with the organization of Golgi sacculi where viral tubes are anchored. Actin and other matrix proteins can form the cellular protein scaffold for NSm interactions and tube growth while the actomyosin\u2010based motors might mediate macromolecular movements. Contacts with RER and mitochondria most probably provide necessary factors for tube functions. Future work aims to locate viral and cellular proteins in tubes after 3D reconstruction by electron tomography (Cyrklaff et al., 2005; McIntosh et al., 2005). Although factories are very large and complex structures for electron tomography we plan to use 3D maps from serial section reconstructions to assist in segmentation and interpretation of tomograms. In fact, our results also demonstrate that methods of 3D reconstruction from serial sections can benefit from the same principles of segmentation and noise reduction common to electron tomography. These procedures provide three\u2010dimensional maps with enough resolution and details to analyse contacts between small elements such as virus assemblies inside very large and complex structures such as whole eukaryotic cells. This will hopefully help us to understand how viral macromolecular complexes interact with cell components to create the unique architecture of virus factories.",
