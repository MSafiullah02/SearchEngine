            "text": "Many different enteric picornaviruses, including coxsackievirus B (CVB), cause acute or chronic aseptic meningitis and/or encephalitis in young children and immunocompromised individuals (Muir and van Loon, 1997; Liow et al., 1999; Rotbart, 2000; Hinson and Tyor, 2001). Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and B4 (CVB4) infections in mice have also been used to study myocarditis and pancreatitis, as these viruses are known to cause these diseases in humans as well as in mice (Ramsingh et al., 1997; Modlin et al., 1999). In addition, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) belonging to the cardiovirus genus of the picornavirus family causes acute encephalitis and/or chronic demyelinating disease in experimental mice; thus, this system has been used as a relevant model for virus\u2010induced demyelinating disease (Kim et al., 2001). Many of the previous studies have been focused on immune components involved in myocarditis and pancreatitis for CVB and demyelination for TMEV. However, numerous recent studies recognized the importance of innate immune responses to viral infections subsequently influencing the development of specific adaptive immune responses to the infectious agents (Liew and McInnes, 2002; Reiss et al., 2002). Despite the importance of innate immune responses, virtually nothing is known about the initial responses to CVB or other picornaviruses by human glial cells. Such studies may be valuable in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of encephalitis and demyelination induced by these viruses.",

            "text": "Chemokines are important mediators of the inflammatory response to many stimuli, including viral infections. Chemokines appear to have multiple biological functions in inflammatory responses, such as chemoattraction of a variety of cells, activation of certain cell populations, angiogenesis of endothelial cells and blood\u2010brain barrier dysfunction (Kossmann et al., 1997; Kunkel and Butcher, 2002). In viral meningitis, interleukin\u20108 (IL\u20108), IFNgamma\u2010inducible protein\u201010 (IP\u201010), and monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20101 (MCP\u20101) appear to be responsible for the chemoattraction of neutrophils, peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs), and activated T cells (Lahrtz et al., 1998). Similarly, significant elevation of MCP\u20101 and IL\u20108 is demonstrated in patients with demyelinating diseases (Van Der Voorn et al., 1999; Polyak et al., 2001). The production of cytokines and chemokines has also been shown in the CNS of mice following a variety of viral infections, including TMEV (Asensio and Campbell, 1997; Lane et al., 1998; Hoffman et al., 1999; Noe et al., 1999; Lane et al., 2000; Theil et al., 2000). Various chemokines were found in the CNS during the onset and late stages of TMEV\u2010induced disease (Hoffman et al., 1999; Theil et al., 2000). More recently, we have shown that TMEV infection primarily upregulates regulated upon activation in normal T\u2010cells, expressed, and secreted (RANTES) and IP\u201010 gene expression in primary murine astrocyte cultures and broader chemokine genes in oligodendrocyte and microglia cultures as early as 30 min after viral infection (Palma and Kim, 2001). These virus\u2010induced chemokines overlap with those that are inducible by proinflammatory cytokines in human and mouse astrocytes (Wesselingh et al., 1990; Shrikant et al., 1995; Shrikant and Benveniste, 1996), suggesting that glial cells, astrocytes in particular, may be critical for early recruitment of inflammatory cells in the initiation of virus\u2010induced, immune\u2010mediated demyelination. However, very little is known about this chemokine gene expression in human astrocytes following infection with CVB, which is a potentially important mechanism involved in the initiation of inflammatory disease in target tissues, including the CNS.",

We demonstrate that all these viruses induce IL\u20108 and MCP\u20101 selectively in primary human astrocyte cultures and a human astrocytoma line. Activation of both activator protein\u20101 (AP\u20101) and NF\u2010\u03baB transcription factors appears to be necessary for the chemokine gene activation, suggesting that both factors are involved in the activation of chemokine genes in human astrocytes infected with various picornaviruses. This pattern of activated chemokine genes in human astrocytes is significantly different from that in mouse astrocytes, and the differences between the species may differentially affect the pathogenic outcome by infection with the identical viruses.",

In addition, the chemokine gene activation patterns were compared to that induced by TMEV, which is known to induce various chemokine genes in primary murine astrocytes (Palma and Kim, 2001). The chemokine mRNAs expressed following infection with these viruses were identical with respect to the chemokines and kinetics. As early as 1\u20132 h after viral infection, the chemokine mRNAs were detectable and levels increased at 4\u20138 h. In addition, the chemokine genes activated by these viruses were very selective; only MCP\u20101 and IL\u20108 mRNAs of seven different chemokine mRNAs tested were significantly induced. Although the levels of chemokine gene activation were relatively low in the primary human astrocyte cultures, the pattern was virtually identical to that seen with the U\u2010373 astrocyte cell line (Fig. 1B). The lower level of chemokine gene activation in the primary cultures may reflect lower infectivity and/or cell numbers used due to limited supply.",

The results clearly indicate that the selective chemokine gene activation following infection with virus results in the production of the chemokine proteins. Thus, these chemokines induced upon viral infection are likely to affect the type and level of inflammatory responses by influencing the infiltration of select cell types. To determine further whether such chemokine gene activation requires viral replication, the chemokine levels in similar cultures exposed to ultraviolet (UV)\u2010inactivated virus were compared to those of intact virus (Fig. 2). The results clearly indicate that UV inactivation abrogates the ability of virus to induce chemokine gene activation.",

Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the molecules indicated that extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK\u20101/2) and c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK) were activated as early as 0.5\u20131 h and persisted for 4\u20138 h after viral infection (Fig. 3A). The levels of total ERK\u20101/2 were similar throughout the time periods indicating that the increases in the phosphoproteins were not due to the differences in the concentrations of proteins loaded to the gel. Similarly, activation of p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) was also detectable 1 h after viral infection (Fig. 3B). Therefore, infection of human astrocytes with picornavirus results in activation of the MAPK involved in inflammatory responses. To correlate the activation of MAPK with chemokine production, activation of a potential downstream transcription factor, AP\u20101 was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), using the consensus AP\u20101\u2010specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C). Our results clearly indicate that the AP\u20101 transcription factor is also activated soon after viral infection. AP\u20101 accumulation showed a peak at 0.5\u20131 h and was reduced significantly at 2 h and thereafter. The AP\u20101 binding assay was specific for the nucleotide sequence, as an excess amount of the unlabeled oligonucleotides successfully blocked the binding of nuclear extracts to the labeled nucleotide probe. These results strongly suggest that picornaviral infection leads to the activation of MAPK as well as AP\u20101 that is potentially associated with chemokine production.",

Therefore, the possibility of NF\u2010\u03baB activation in the astrocytoma cells following viral infection was next examined (Fig. 5). First, the levels of total I\u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and phosphorylated form of I\u03baB\u2010\u03b1 were assessed during viral infection in astrocytes by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). The results indicated that I\u03baB\u2010\u03b1 is rapidly phosphorylated (>2\u2010fold) as early as 15 min upon viral infection, as compared to uninfected control cultures, and sustained for at least 8 h. In addition, the overall I\u03baB level was increased significantly 15 min after viral infection, declined rapidly at 30 min, and remained low thereafter. These results strongly suggest that I\u03baB is rapidly phosphorylated and subsequently degraded upon viral infection, leading to NF\u2010\u03baB activation. To assess directly the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, accumulation of NF\u2010\u03baB molecules in the nuclei of virus\u2010infected astrocytoma cells was assessed by EMSA, using NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 5B). The results indicate that nuclear translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB starts at 15 min, peaks at 30 min, and then becomes reduced yet remains elevated at 2 h following viral infection. The binding was completely abrogated to background levels in the presence of excess amount of unlabeled NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 5C). Altogether, these results clearly demonstrate that the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway is rapidly activated in human astrocytes similar to the AP\u20101 transcription factor upon picornavirus infection (Fig. 3).",

The experimental results showed that blocking I\u03baB phosphorylation inhibits transcription of both MCP\u20101 and IL\u20108 messages induced after viral infection, leading to complete inhibition at 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml of PDTC. The levels of chemokines secreted by the virus\u2010infected cells in the presence of the inhibitor corresponded with transcription levels.

To examine this possibility, activation of NF\u2010\u03baB was assessed following TMEV infection in the presence of inhibitors for ERK and NF\u2010\u03baB, respectively (Fig. 7). NF\u2010\u03baB activation was apparently independent of ERK\u20101/2 activation (Fig. 7A), since the presence of inhibitor of upstream MEK, U0126, did not affect the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB induced by viral infection. Similarly, the presence of NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor, PDTC, did not affect the activation of ERK\u20101/2 (Fig. 7B), which appears to be necessary for induction of chemokine gene expression by viral infection (Fig. 4). Inhibition of ERK\u20101/2 activation with pretreatment with U0126, but not control U0124, significantly reduced the nuclear translocation of AP\u20101, suggesting that an ERK\u20101/2 pathway is required for AP\u20101 activation (Fig. 7C). Together, these results indicate that activation of both NF\u2010\u03baB as well as AP\u20101 transcription factors are necessary for the human chemokine gene expression, although the activation pathways for these transcription factors are independent of each other.",

Therefore, the chemokine gene induction limited to MCP\u20101 and IL\u20108 in human astrocytes by the same viruses appears to be significantly different from that of mouse astrocytes. To verify the possible differences in the chemokine gene expression between human and mouse astrocytes, chemokine gene expression in mouse primary astrocytes was also assessed after infection with TMEV, CVB3, or CVB4 (Fig. 8). As previously shown with TMEV infection (Palma and Kim, 2001), primary mouse astrocytes expressed a wide range of chemokines following infection with these viruses. Thus, the pattern of chemokine genes activated in mouse astrocytes by these viruses is significantly different from that in human astrocytes, where no significant levels of RANTES and IP\u201010 genes are activated. These results clearly indicate that the pattern of chemokine gene activation by picornaviruses in human astrocytes is much more restricted as compared to that in mouse astrocytes.",

To understand the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the initiation of inflammatory responses in the CNS following infection with these picornaviruses, chemokine production in human primary astrocyte cultures and an astrocytoma line were analyzed upon infection with CVB or TMEV. Our results demonstrated that only select chemokines, IL\u20108 and MCP\u20101 are activated in human astrocytes by viral infection (Figs. 1 and 7). Recent studies reported that either human primary astrocytes or astrocytoma lines produce IL\u20108 or MCP\u20101 following infection with HIV\u20101 or coronavirus, respectively (Cota et al., 2000; Edwards et al., 2000). In addition, infection with certain picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus and CVB3, can induce IL\u20108 in various human fibroblast cells (Johnston et al., 1998; Heim et al., 2000). These results strongly suggest that induction of highly restricted chemokine gene activation is common to many different viral infections in various human cell types.",

Furthermore, IL\u20108 is known to enhance the cytopathic effect of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of picornavirus on a human cell line (Khabar et al., 1997b). This chemokine appears to play a major negative role in the early defense against viruses by inhibiting interferon\u2010\u03b1 (IFN\u2010\u03b1) activity resulting in increases in viral RNA synthesis and persistence (Khabar et al., 1997a). In contrast, MCP\u20101 is a member of the CC family of chemokine, directing neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage infiltration to the site of infection. These chemokines have also been found in various inflammatory responses and at the sites of inflammatory diseases, including demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis (Van Der Voorn et al., 1999; Polyak et al., 2001). Therefore, these chemokines, in particular, are most likely to play profound roles in the initiation and expansion of inflammatory responses to various picornaviruses in the target tissues of viral infection, including the CNS.",

            "text": "The signal pathways responsible for the highly selective chemokine gene activation in human astrocytes infected with these picornaviruses have also been assessed in the present study. We primarily used TMEV as a representative picornavirus for these studies since identical patterns of chemokine gene activation are observed upon infection with TMEV, CVB3, or CVB4 in both human (Fig. 1) and murine astrocytes (Fig. 8), suggesting that common mechanisms are involved in chemokine gene activation by these viruses, and perhaps by picornavirus in general. Interestingly, activation of both MAPK and NF\u2010\u03baB appears to be necessary for the chemokine gene activation after viral infection (Figs. 4 and 6). In particular, U0126, a specific inhibitor for ERK activation, exerted a powerful suppression of both IL\u20108 and MCP\u20101 gene expression. Recently, it has been shown that IL\u20108 production is linked to activation of ERK\u20101/2 by other viruses (Chen et al., 2000; Alcorn et al., 2001). In addition, HIV\u20101 Tat protein is capable of inducing primarily IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, and IL\u20108 chemokine gene expression in a human astrocyte line (CRT\u2010MG), and the expression of both MCP\u20101 and IL\u20108, but not IP\u201010, is inhibited by U0126 (Kutsch et al., 2000). However, it remains unclear how the ERK\u20101/2 activation pathway is associated with chemokine gene expression. Previously, it has been established that MEKK1 (ERK kinase kinase\u20101) induces activation of both IKK\u2010\u03b1 and IKK\u2010\u03b2 leading to NF\u2010\u03baB activation. (Lee et al., 1997, 1998). Thus, ERK activation may be necessary for NF\u2010\u03baB activation following infection with picornavirus. However, our results show that activation of ERK induced after viral infection is independent from activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (Fig. 7). In addition, it appears that the downstream target of ERK is AP\u20101 for chemokine gene expression in human astrocytes (Fig. 7C), similar to human microglia following stimulation with IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Kim et al., 2002). Recently, activation of p38 and JNK was shown in fibroblast cells following infection with EMCV (Iordanov et al., 2000). Since p38 MAP kinase is involved for NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent gene expression by regulating the DNA binding of TATA\u2010binding protein to the TATA box (Carter et al., 1999), this MAPK may also play a role in this pathway.",

These results strongly suggest that viral infection and replication are required for cellular gene activation by picornavirus. Interestingly, our preliminary study suggests that overlapping but different signaling pathways are required for viral replication and chemokine gene activation in human astrocytes. For example, NF\u03baB and p38 inhibitors, but not ERK inhibitor, suppressed viral message production, which is different from chemokine gene activation. We do not know why MAPK remain activated up to 8 h in contrast to AP\u20101, which decreases after 2 h. Similarly, we do not know why phospho\u2010I\u03baB remains high, and yet overall I\u03baB levels recover. Obviously, additional studies are required to unravel the complex signaling relationship between viral replication and activation of chemokine genes, as well as other cellular survival genes.",

In addition, IL\u20108 gene expression induced by cytomegalovirus (CMV) involves concurrent binding of AP\u20101 and NF\u2010\u03baB to the promoter sites of the IL\u20108 gene (Murayama et al., 1997), suggesting that the combination of these transcription factors is a powerful inducer for selective chemokine gene expression (Ondrey et al., 1999). Similarly, induction of MCP\u20101 by IL\u20101\u03b2 in human endothelial cells depends on the cooperation between AP\u20101 and NF\u2010\u03baB (Martin et al., 1997). However, it is also conceivable that undefined additional regulatory elements in the IL\u20108 and MCP\u20101 genes may be involved in the expression of these chemokine genes, as described for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) response element in the IL\u20108 promoter region (Casola et al., 2000). Nevertheless, it is very likely that chemokine genes responsive to a combination of AP\u20101 and NF\u2010\u03baB transcription factors are preferentially activated in human astrocytes by certain viral infections, including picornaviruses. This preferential activation of select chemokine gene expression may function as a mechanism favoring viral host evasion by lowering antiviral IFN function and promoting cellular infiltration, ultimately supporting viral expansion and inflammation.",

Species differences in the chemokine gene activation may represent differences in the requirements for chemokine gene activation. For example, the RANTES gene does not contain an AP\u20101 binding site and yet is activated predominantly in mouse astrocytes infected with these viruses. Thus, NF\u2010\u03baB transcription factor alone appears to be sufficient for mouse chemokine/cytokine gene activation, perhaps leading to broader gene expression (Palma et al., 2003). The significance of this difference in chemokine gene activation between human and mouse astrocytes is unclear. However, the difference in the chemokine gene activation pattern is species specific and not dependent on the viruses in the picornarvirus family, as demonstrated using different picornaviruses in the present study (Figs. 1 and 8). The differences in chemokine gene expression are not likely to reflect a difference in the level of infection between human and mouse astrocytes, since a similar infectivity (20\u201330%), as well as unaltered patterns by varying viral dose, are observed in these cell types. Thus, an identical virus may be able to manifest a different disease in different species. The type of initial chemokines produced alone may not be sufficient to direct the outcome of inflammatory diseases since these viruses induce different diseases in the same species. Perhaps, combinations of the level and site of viral persistence and the type of infiltrating cells may shape the adaptive immune response leading to either the protection or further development of specific inflammatory diseases.",
