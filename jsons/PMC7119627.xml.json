Of the several methods used for the detection of CCV, electron microscopy, using negatively stained faecal samples, appears to be an essential diagnostic tool (Hyatt, 1989). EM has been reported to be more sensitive and useful than virus isolation for detecting both coronaviruses and rotaviruses (Naeem and Goyal, 1988). However, the common presence of coronavirus-like particles in faeces presents difficulties in the diagnosis of CCV by EM and requires confirmation by other diagnostic methods (Athanssious et al., 1994). n-PCR, on the other hand, allows the diagnosis of CCV infection more rapidly than the traditional tests, such as virus isolation, and would be valuable for the diagnosis of CCV in faecal samples where CCV is inactivated, or when the number of virions is less than 106 per g of faeces and cannot be detected by EM examination.",
