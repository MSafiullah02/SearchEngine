Additionally, imbalances in pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant mechanisms and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are important components in NAFLD pathogenesis. The role of genetic variations in the predisposition to steatosis development by affecting various steps in the normal fat and carbohydrate metabolism is also under investigation [1, 5, 14].",

IR and subsequent hyperinsulinemia seem to be the major factors behind the alterations in the hepatic pathways of uptake, synthesis, degradation, and secretion of FFAs, which ultimately leads to the accumulation of lipids in the hepatocytes [18, 19]. Elevated plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, and fatty acids promote hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride uptake, de-novo lipid synthesis and impaired \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids by negative feedback. The result is an inappropriate shifting of FFAs to non-adipose tissue, such as the liver; together with inflammatory cytokines and specific adipokines associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, a vicious cycle is initiated that contributes to impaired insulin signaling and hepatic IR [5, 15, 20, 21].",

The second hit occurs due to increased hepatic oxidative stress, which is associated with increased FFA metabolism, diminished anti-oxidant activity, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and endotoxin levels, and especially mitochondrial dysfunction and/or endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver [18, 19].",

With this insight, a new and more realistic model was proposed, namely, the \u201cmulti-parallel hits\u201d hypothesis [24]. The main concept of this theory is that different events occur that in turn determine liver damage, but these events take place in parallel, not consecutively. We can consider the following elements as the main pathological protagonists: IR, oxidative stress, adipose tissue and pancreas toxicity, altered lipid metabolism, bile acids, gut microbiota, bacterial endotoxins, serum and liver iron overload, innate and adaptive immunity, and finally the polymorphisms of the genes involved in lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis [5, 14, 25\u201327]. It is important to underline that all the mechanisms of damage that are involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD enhance two conditions that are central in the progression of NASH, that is, IR and systemic chronic inflammation [13].",

Therefore, in theory, insulin resistance should be the main target, together with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic agents. Currently, the first-line pharmacological approaches for NASH are the antioxidant vitamin E and the insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone. Both agents are unique, in that they have provided a sufficient degree of evidence in terms of efficacy, showing a positive effect on transaminases, fat accumulation, and inflammation. However, vitamin E has no proven effect on fibrosis and on long-term morbidity and mortality, and pioglitazone has a negative impact on weight. In addition, the safety of pioglitazone remains uncertain as data about its long-term use are not available [5, 13\u201316]. Other drugs have been studied, such as metformin, ursodeoxycholic acid, statins, pentoxifylline, and orlistat, but with only partially positive results. Among the emerging treatments, telmisartan is particularly interesting, as it seems to have an impact on insulin resistance, liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, according to preliminary studies [13\u201316]. However, the lack of large randomized clinical trials precludes the use of this drug as a consolidated option treatment, being formally recommended only in NALFD patients with an established indication for anti-hypertensive therapy [13, 19].",

            "text": "The RAS is classically conceived as a single hormonal cascade responsible for controlling cardiovascular, renal, and adrenal functions [31]. It is primarily initiated by the expression of angiotensinogen (AGT), which is a protein that is produced by several cell types, including hepatocytes, adipocytes, and kidney cells. However, the liver is considered the primary source of circulating AGT in normal physiology [32, 33]. The kidney-derived renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I), a biologically inactive peptide that is rapidly hydrolyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) [34]. Ang II mediates the biological responses through two G-protein-coupled receptors, Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R) and Ang II receptor type 2 (AT2R); however, the main described effects are mediated by AT1R [35, 36]. The AT1R is in abundance in adult tissues, whereas AT2R is mainly expressed during fetal development and is upregulated in pathologic conditions. The activation of ACE\u2013Ang II\u2013AT1R frequently contributes to physiopathological changes, such as excessive renal sodium reabsorption, abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, disproportionately high aldosterone secretion, and inappropriate cardiovascular responses. In addition, several pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic pathways are stimulated by AT1R activation [37, 38]. Individuals with increased FFA levels caused by lipid/heparin infusion, which mimic the lipid profile of patients with visceral fat obesity and insulin resistance, have significantly higher Ang II production in mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells and also Ang-dependent leukocyte activation, which leads to endothelial dysfunction [37, 38]. AT2R is generally reported to mediate effects that are opposing and counterbalancing those mediated by AT1R in vitro as well as in vivo [29].",

Several enzymatic routes may be involved in Ang-(1\u20137) formation, but it is mainly formed directly from Ang II by a new enzyme, a homolog to ACE, called ACE2 [31, 34, 43\u201346]. The ACE2\u2013angiotensin-(1\u20137)/Mas axis can produce nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation as well as anti-arrhythmic, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-thrombotic effects [28, 41, 42, 47\u201350]. In humans, evidence shows that Ang(1\u20137) not only potentiates the vasodilating effect of bradykinin, possibly through a mechanism(s) involving nitric oxide release, but also antagonizes the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II [51, 52].",

Ang II has been implicated as a major player in the altered hepatic lipid metabolism observed in NAFLD [64], influencing intracellular insulin signaling by several mechanisms, which may result in worsening insulin resistance, the main pathophysiological element of NAFLD [39, 65\u201367]. Ang II also induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), initiating and propagating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), resulting in inflammation and additional impairment of insulin signaling. Kanno et al. and Wei et al. showed that an increased expression of Ang II induces NAFLD and modulates inflammatory cell recruitment into the liver during liver injury [68, 69]. Accordingly, liver injuries in AT1-knockout mice present reduced inflammation and fibrosis [70, 71]. Paizis et al. demonstrated that AT1R genes are upregulated in areas of active hepatic fibrogenesis, meaning that chronic injury upregulates RAS in local tissues, which seems to contribute to the vicious cycle of steatosis\u2013necroinflammation\u2013fibrosis [13, 72].",

For the first time, Feltenberger et al. evaluated the effects of a mouse model of oral Ang-(1\u20137) administration in high-fat-induced steatosis, liver metabolism, and inflammation. A reduction in fat mass, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis was observed and associated with decreased circulating total cholesterol, triglycerides, and alanine transaminase enzyme, improved lipid metabolism, and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [64]. These effects were associated with the beneficial regulation of the RAS gene expression. Other reports indicated an important role of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis in the liver, suggesting that oral treatment with Ang-(1\u20137) improves the status of steatohepatitis, as well as reduces adipogenesis-related markers [46, 60, 64]. Lastly, in humans with liver disease, both ACE2 gene expression and plasma Ang-(1\u20137) are increased, compared to that in healthy livers, confirming that the key regulator of Ang-(1\u20137) production in the alternative axis of the RAS is upregulated in response to hepatic injury [73]. All these observations confirmed the protective role of ACE2/Ang(1\u20137)/Mas axis activation, and might represent a promising strategy for the treatment targeting hepatic disorders [61].",

ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used to inhibit the ACE/Ang II/AT1 arm and stimulate the activity of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis [66, 74]. Both drug classes have been broadly used in congestive heart failure, hypertension, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease [75, 76] and present significant effects in improving lipid and glucose metabolism [21, 49, 59, 64, 77]. Because the AT1R has a well-established role in mediating most of the deleterious actions of Ang II in the liver, the AT1R antagonism is considered more specific than ACE inhibition [32, 78]. Evidence indicates that treatment with ARBs results in greater improvement in insulin sensitivity and larger reduction in the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus. One possible explanation could be the inhibitory action of ACEi on both the AT1R and AT2R, resulting in suppression of the counterbalancing effects of AT2R on the actions of AT1R [28].",

Additionally, ARBs may improve transaminases, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation, in the NAFLD setting [19, 28]. The effect of ARBs on hepatic fibrosis in different animal models is well-described in the literature. ARBs inhibit stellate cell activity in obese mice, leading to a decrease in hepatic fibrosis [61, 82]. The evidence in humans shows that subjects with NAFLD who have been submitted to ARB treatment commonly have decreased liver fibrosis markers [71, 83]. These results suggest that liver fibrosis is mediated via the renin\u2013angiotensin system, ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, which demonstrates a beneficial role of angiotensin receptor blockers [61].",

Moreover, telmisartan, but not ARB valsartan, increased the expression of both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded genes in skeletal muscles that are known to play important roles in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Thus, in addition to a class effect of ARBs in modulating adipocyte size, these findings raise the possibility that certain molecules, such as telmisartan, may have a particularly strong impact on fat-cell volume and fat accumulation, as well as distinctive effects on energy metabolism, which may help to protect against dietary-induced visceral obesity and weight gain [90]. The efficacy of telmisartan in reducing visceral-fat mass may be relevant for patients, because an increase in visceral fat is related to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and an impaired metabolic pattern. Additionally, visceral fat serves as an independent predictor of mortality in men [98].",

The anti-oxidative effects of telmisartan have been studied [99], and its beneficial effects on hepatocytes can be partially based on the drug\u2019s anti-oxidative properties [61]. Telmisartan reduces hepatic injuries resulting from type I diabetes mellitus [85], and when associated with propranolol, reduces several liver fibrosis signals, such as hydroxyproline, bile duct proliferation procollagen-\u03b11, endothelin-1, and metalloproteinases in a primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)-like mouse model [100]. Telmisartan also prevented liver fibrosis in rat bile duct ligation model [101]. In mice on a high-fat diet that had received a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) two days after birth, treatment with telmisartan reduced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis [102]. Similarly, telmisartan reduced liver fibrosis, that had been induced in rats by a short- or long-term methionine-deficient and choline-deficient diet [103], and also prevented the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma [104].",

            "text": "As mentioned earlier in this article, pathological changes in NAFLD may at least partly result from the activation of the inflammatory arm of RAS [94], especially in the context of insulin resistance. Telmisartan not only blocks the RAS, but also has been consistently proven to reduce insulin resistance [66, 84\u201388], thus, its effects on liver histology should be expected. Indeed, morphological evidence of the amelioration of NASH was found in several animal studies using telmisartan [91, 94, 97, 105], thus reducing inflammation and fibrosis by suppressing macrophage infiltration into the liver [94, 97]. Telmisartan treatment attenuated liver steatosis with decreased hepatic triglycerides, attenuated liver fibrogenesis with decreased type I collagen, and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) mRNA expressions [97]. Clinical studies have resulted in similar outcomes. Hypertensive patients with MetS treated with low doses of the ARB telmisartan (20 mg/day) for 4 weeks showed a significant insulin-sensitizing effect, compared with that of hypertensive patients treated with valsartan (40 mg/day). It was the first time that a lower dose of telmisartan was proven to be sufficient to significantly improve glucose metabolism, whereas such an effect was not observed in valsartan-treated subjects [106]. Similarly, in a randomized control trial on hypertension-associated NASH patients, telmisartan (20 mg/day)-improved steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance, and the lipid profile more consistent than valsartan (80 mg/day) in a 20-month treatment period, despite a similar blood pressure reduction [107]. Enjoji et al. evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ARB telmisartan (40 mg/day) and olmesartan (20 mg/day) in NAFLD patients in a 6-month treatment period and concluded that both drugs significantly improved insulin resistance and liver injury, but the effect tended to be more distinct with telmisartan. This result suggests that these two ARBs may be used as liver-protecting agents in NAFLD patients. Although they did not investigate the effect of other ARBs (losartan, valsartan, candesartan), patients already using these drugs for hypertension treatment had the medication changed to olmesartan or telmisartan with a resultant significant improvement in insulin resistance and transaminases levels [3]. Another randomized trial in which telmisartan and losartan were administered did not display statistically significant differences between these two drugs on improvement in liver enzyme levels, suggesting that telmisartan may exert more potential effects in improving fatty liver, which is an important evaluated outcome [108]. In a recent 1-year randomized control trial, Alam et al. observed that telmisartan (40 mg/day or 80 mg/day if the patient was still hypertensive after taking 40 mg/day) significantly improved the overall histology of NASH patients, reducing inflammation and fibrosis markers independent of weight reduction [30]. Additionally, telmisartan was similarly effective in hypertensive and non-hypertensive NASH patients and had very minimal side effects during this period of treatment. The fact that the adverse effects encountered with telmisartan were less frequent than with other ARBs or ACE inhibitors is noteworthy [109].",

            "text": "Concerning AT1R-independent effects, it is important to emphasize the relationship between telmisartan and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) activation. Telmisartan works as a partial agonist of PPAR-\u03b3 [61, 87, 91, 97, 110], a property that does not appear to be shared by other ARBs [94, 111], except for losartan, which has already been reported to exert agonistic effects on this gene [112]. The nuclear PPAR\u03b3 receptor is a transcription factor regulating many genes related to adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity [91]. Telmisartan influences the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 target genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It has been shown to reduce glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed on a high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet [89]. PPAR-\u03b3 increases the insulin sensitivity, high-density lipoprotein levels, and decreases inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, migration, and fatty acid and triglyceride levels, but without causing the fluid collection associated with full agonists of PPAR-\u03b3, such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone [35, 61, 110, 113, 114].

However, some limitations should be noted [115]. PPAR-\u03b3 effects are elicited only by micromolar concentrations of telmisartan, whereas low nanomolar concentrations are sufficient to block AT1 receptors [116]. Thus, telmisartan is >1000-fold more potent as an AT1 receptor antagonist than as a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist [115]. According to this fact, most of the effect of telmisartan on metabolism is likely to be mediated by the blockade of AT1 receptors, together with the compensatory overstimulation of AT2 receptors and activation of the ECA2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis, as angiotensin II levels rise during chronic AT1 blockade.",

The HPA hyper-reactivity has been verified in rats and patients with diabetes [117], and the AT1R has been identified as a regulator of stress reactions [118]. Moreover, the Ang II-stimulated hyper-reactivity in the HPA axis was found to account for the reduction in glucose utilization in obese Zucker rats [119], revealing a functionally relevant crosstalk between Ang II, the HPA axis, and metabolic functions. It was demonstrated that HPA reactivity was reduced after AT1R blockade in rats with diet-induced metabolic syndrome. The simultaneous decrease in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) indicates a pituitary mechanism, requiring that peripherally administered TEL penetrates the blood\u2013brain barrier. This was verified by measuring TEL concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and indirectly by the ability of TEL to antagonize the central effects of Ang II [120]. All these mechanisms could explain the differences between ARBs on their effects on insulin resistance, transaminase levels and liver histology, and the superiority of telmisartan in treating NAFLD and in preventing its progression to hepatic cirrhosis.",

However, large multicenter randomized-controlled trials are needed to consolidate these findings. Currently, treatment with telmisartan and with other RAS blockers can only be formally recommended in NALFD patients with an established indication of anti-hypertensive therapy.",
