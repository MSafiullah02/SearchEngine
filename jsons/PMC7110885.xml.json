This radiation is proportional to the surface temperature of the body (Bitar et al., 2009), and is evaluated using a thermographic camera, which produces images with different colour patterns depending on the temperature of the imaged objects. The temperature values in the images are strongly related to the emissivity of the object, which is defined as the relative ability of a surface to emit and absorb radiation (Rodr\u00edguez-Prieto et al., 2013). As up to 60% of heat loss of an animal may occur in the infrared range, radiated heat loss could be used as an early indicator of fever in pathological conditions (Schaefer et al., 2007).",

It is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family Reoviridae; so far 26 different serotypes have been identified (Hofmann et al., 2008, Maan et al., 2011). The disease is of economic importance due to losses associated with mortality and morbidity, veterinary treatment, implementation of control and eradication programmes and commercial restrictions in infected areas (Velthuis et al., 2010). The severity of BT varies according to species, breed and bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype. Sheep have been considered the most severely affected livestock species and typical clinical symptoms include apathy, generalized subcutaneous oedema (mainly observed on the head, intermandibular area and neck), nasal discharge, oral lesions, cyanotic tongue, dyspnoea and lameness (Schwartz-Cornil et al., 2008, Maclachlan et al., 2009). However, fever is the main clinical sign of BT in sheep and the earliest to be detected (Hamblin et al., 1998, Worwa et al., 2010, Perez de Diego et al., 2011).",

The thermographic temperature used in this study was the maximal eye and surrounding skin area infrared temperature, which was defined as the highest temperature identified by the software utilities on the orbital surface (Schaefer et al., 2007). Since environmental temperature and emissivity could influence the temperature values obtained by IRT, these factors were adjusted in each thermal image. The emissivity of the eye surface was estimated as 0.98 (Girardin et al., 1999), while the environmental temperature was set at 20 \u00b0C. In total, 208 rectal temperatures and 208 IRT pictures were collected (Table 1\n).",
