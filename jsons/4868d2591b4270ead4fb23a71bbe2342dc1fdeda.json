In its entirety, different species of wildlife can be found and biodiversity in this area is very high (Mrs\u02c7ic\u00b4, 1997) . The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most important big-game species in Slovenia with a hunting bag of around 6000 pigs per year. The population density of wild boars in Slovenia has increased drastically during the last decade despite hunting. Wild boars are present all over the country; however, the highest densities are situated in the southwest part of the country. As in Slovenia, wild boar population has increased both in number and density across Europe (Artois et al., 2002) . In the last decade, evidences accumulated show that in some situations wild boars can act as a reservoir for infectious diseases of domestic pigs (Elbers et al., 2000; Laddomada, 2000; Al Dahouk, et al., 2005) and movement of these animals can potentially result in dissemination of these diseases. Currently there is no recorded data regarding prevalence and distribution of the most important infectious agents among wild boars in Slovenia. Therefore, our objective was to determine the seroprevalence against selected infectious pathogens in wild boars from Slovenia.",

The prevalence of antibodies against ADV found in the present study (31%) is higher than that reported from Eastern (8.9%) and Western (9.9%) Germany (Mu\u00a8ller et al., 1998; Lutz et al., 2003) , France (5.5%) (Albina et al., 2000) , Italy (30%) (Capua et al., 1997) and lower than that reported from south-central part of Spain (56%) , Croatia (54%) (\u017d upanc\u02c7ic\u00b4et al., 2002) , Tunisia (54%) (Jridi et al., 1996) and Corsica with prevalence up to 61% (Albina et al., 2000) . Prevalence of AVD antibodies in wild boars from the southern part of the USA was found to be 29% (Nettles and Erickson, 1984) , 35% (Van Der Leek et al., 1993) , 38% (Corn et al., 2004) and 61% (Gresham et al., 2002) . Hahn et al. (1997) estimated that the potential source for reinfection in the USA is the large population of wild boars where prevalence of ADV is variable but can be exceeded by up to 60% as was estimated later in South Carolina (Gresham et al., 2002) . The relatively high prevalence of antibodies against ADV in wild boars in Slovenia is surprising because our domestic pig population is free of AD. In the last two decades, there was only one outbreak of AD in 1996 in a very limited area where the disease was eradicated by slaughtering of all seropositive pigs (Valenc\u02c7ak, 2002) .",
