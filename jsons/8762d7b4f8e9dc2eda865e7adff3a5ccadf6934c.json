The \u03b5 SIP molecule consisted of a single-chain antibody (scFv) specific for the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) linked to the \u03b5 -CH4 domain from human immunoglobulin E (IgE). In some constructs, the sequence encoding the \u03b5 SIP molecule was flanked by the leader peptide from the original murine antibody at its N-terminus and an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (HDEL) at its C-terminus to allow the expressed protein to be directed to, and retained within, the endoplasmic reticulum. Western blot analysis of samples from Nicotiana clevelandii or cowpea tissue infected with constructs revealed the presence of SIP molecules which retained their ability to dimerize. The analysis of crude plant extracts revealed that the plant-expressed \u03b5 SIP molecules could bind to and neutralize TGEV in tissue culture, the levels of binding and neutralization reflecting the level of expression. Oral administration of crude extracts from SIP-expressing plant tissue to 2-day-old piglets demonstrated that the extracts which showed the highest levels of in vitro neutralization could also provide in vivo protection against challenge with TGEV.",

            "text": "Protection against enteric infections can be provided by the oral administration of neutralizing antibodies. This approach, termed 'passive immunization', is a particularly attractive method for protecting newborn animals against such infections. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus which is an important pathogen that infects both the respiratory and enteric tissues of pigs. In newborn pigs, TGEV causes close to 100% mortality (Enjuanes and van der Zeijst, 1995) , and it would be of great benefit if passive immunization could be used to protect such animals. The major antigenic sites of TGEV, involved in the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies, are located in the globular portion of the spike (S) protein (Gebauer et al ., 1991) . The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6A.C3 has been shown to recognize a highly conserved epitope in the S protein and can neutralize all TGEV isolates tested, as well as TGEV-related coronaviruses infecting pigs, dogs and cats (Su\u00f1e et al ., 1990; Gebauer et al ., 1991) . The recombinant immunoglobulin A (IgA) form of mAb 6A.C3 has been shown to be highly efficient at neutralization when expressed in the milk of transgenic mice (Castilla et al ., 1997 Sola et al ., 1998) , raising the possibility of basing passive immunization against TGEV on this molecule.",

Bestagno et al ., in preparation) . SIPs are derivatives of single-chain antibodies (scFvs), in which the scFv sequence is fused to the constant domain of a heavy chain that is responsible for dimerization (Li et al ., 1997; Figure 1a, b) . SIPs combine the advantages of the bivalency of full-length antibodies with the small size of scFvs, and have been shown to have higher tissue penetration than complete antibodies and slower clearance than scFvs (Borsi et al ., 2002) . Thus, they are attractive candidates for passive immunotherapy. In the case of \u03b5 SIPs, the scFv sequence is fused to the CH4 domain of the S2 subclass of IgE, which permits efficient and stable dimerization via a C-terminal cysteine residue (Batista et al ., 1996; Borsi et al ., 2002) .",

One way of achieving the necessary levels is through the use of virus-based vectors rather than stable transformation (Porta and Lomonossoff, 2002) . In this paper, we report the use of two different plant virus vectors based on potato virus X (PVX) and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) to express an anti-TGEV \u03b5 SIP molecule in two different plant species.

The \u03b5SIP sequence was expressed at the C-terminus of the RNA-2-encoded polyprotein, and thus targeting to the secretory pathway should not affect any viral protein. The HDEL sequence was included because retention in the ER enhances the levels of accumulation of single-chain antibodies in plants (Schouten et al., 1996) . Furthermore, the presence of this sequence has been shown to be necessary to achieve high levels of expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), which had been directed to the secretory pathway after expression from CPMV (L. Nicholson et al., unpublished data) . The strategy was successful, as levels of \u03b5SIP sufficient to protect newborn pigs against TGEV accumulated in leaf tissue. The levels of antibody expression (approximately 2% total soluble protein) are similar to those previously reported for an ER-retained version of an scFv expressed from a PVX vector (Ziegler et al., 2000) , and considerably higher (about 15-20-fold) than the levels obtained when \u03b5SIP was expressed from PVX without an ER retention signal.

In this regard, it is noteworthy that, although the plant tissue expressing the anti-TGEV \u03b5SIP was supplied only orally, a significant decrease in virus titre was observed not only in enteric tissue, but also in the lungs.

About 2.6 g of lyophilized material was obtained from each sample; 0.03 g of each sample was reconstituted with 1 mL of phosphate buffer and the in vitro SIP activity was assayed. To assess the ability of the plantexpressed SIP to confer protection, 0.3 g of lyophilized plant tissue dissolved in 4 mL of water and TGEV PUR46 C11 [10 7 plaque-forming units (pfu) per animal] were added to milk, and the mixture was supplied to 2-day-old piglets via an oral cannula. The piglets were subsequently fed, via baby bottles, with milk mixed with 0.3 g of lyophilized plant tissue dissolved in 4 mL of water. The antibody-containing mixture was administered twice more on the day of challenge and three times on the following 2 days post-challenge. Piglets were killed 2 and 3 days post-challenge, a time at which the virus levels reach a peak in TGEV-infected piglets (S\u00e1nchez et al., 1999) , and virus titres in gut and lung tissue were determined as described by Jim\u00e9nez et al. (1986) . Protection against TGEV by plant extracts was expressed as the ratio of pfu obtained after the administration of extracts from plants infected with the wild-type vectors to that obtained when the corresponding SIP-expressing extracts were supplied. As positive controls, the protection afforded by the administration of 4 mL of a 1 : 10 dilution of ascitic fluid containing mAb 6A.C3 compared with ascitic fluid not containing the antibody, and that afforded by 4 mL of supernatants from Sp2/0 cells expressing anti-TGEV \u03b5SIP compared with supernatants expressing a SIP of irrelevant specificity, were assessed.",

The symptoms were less severe than those observed with wild-type CPMV. RT-PCR of RNA extracted from these first-passage cowpea plants revealed that the SIP-specific insert was retained in the RNA-2 of CPMV-hueSIP. Some leaves also showed the presence of variable amounts of smaller PCR products, indicating the presence of some deletion products (results not shown). To reduce the effect of deletion mutants, infected plant tissue was collected at 7-14 d.p.i. for all subsequent analyses.Expression of \u03b5 SIP in plant tissueWestern blot analysis using anti-human \u03b5 -chain antibodies ofextracts from N. clevelandii leaves infected with PVX-hueSIP revealed the presence of a protein of approximately 42 kDa in samples taken from either inoculated or systemically infected leaves at 7 d.p.i. (Figure 2a). This material corresponds to the monomeric form of \u03b5 SIP, which was expected as the leaf material was analysed under reducing conditions. The material ran as a dimer when examined under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). However, no material corresponding to monomeric \u03b5 SIP was visible by 14 d.p.i., despite detection of the viral coat protein, when an anti-coat protein serum was used to probe the Western blots (Figure 2a). Time-course experiments showed that maximum expression in systemically infected leaves was achieved at 7-10 d.p.i., and expression decreased afterwards. The loss of \u03b5 SIP expression correlated well with the detection of partially deleted sequences observed by PCR at late times postinoculation. Extracts of leaves infected with PVX-nakedhueSIP, in which no leader peptide was present, did not contain detectable levels of \u03b5 SIP at either time. The difference in \u03b5 SIP accumulation in leaves infected with the PVX constructs with and without the leader peptide was not a result of differences in the replication of the viral constructs, as similar levels of coat protein could be detected in all the extracts (Figure 2a). Electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions indicated that \u03b5 SIP was capable of dimerization (data not shown). Western blot analysis using anti-human \u03b5 -chain antibodies of total protein extracted from CPMV-hueSIP-infected cowpea leaves at 22 d.p.i. revealed the presence of a band of the expected size (42 kDa) for the \u03b5 SIP monomer when the sample was examined under reducing conditions (Figure 2b). Under non-reducing conditions, approximately 70% of the \u03b5 SIP-specific material ran at approximately 84 kDa, consistent with efficient dimerization being promoted by the C-terminal cysteine residue present in the CH4 domain of the SIP sequence. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with anti-human \u03b5 -chain antibodies of leaf extracts indicated that they contained levels of \u03b5 SIP representing up to 2% (w/w) total soluble protein.

(a) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of the binding of plantexpressed \u03b5SIPs to partially purified transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) particles. Extracts from Nicotiana clevelandii plants infected with PVX-hueSIP or PVX-nakedhueSIP and cowpea plants infected with CPMV-hueSIP were analysed. In each case, extracts from plants infected with the corresponding wild-type virus [potato virus X (PVX) or cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)] were analysed as a negative control and the binding activity of the same \u03b5SIP molecule expressed in mammalian cells (hueSIP) was used as a positive control. (b) TGEV neutralization assay of \u03b5SIP produced in plants. Plants infected with the wild-type virus were used as negative controls for each plant sample. The neutralization index was calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of virus plaques in the absence of antibody to virus plaques after incubation with the antibody. The results obtained with the plant extracts were compared with those obtained with the parental antibody (monoclonal antibody 6A.C3) and \u03b5SIP (hueSIP) expressed in mammalian cells. The control contained a SIP of irrelevant specificity. Both the neutralization and ELISA data are the mean of at least two independent experiments. levels of binding equivalent to those achieved with the positive control were observed (Figure 3a). However, in this case, the background signal obtained with extracts from wild-type CPMV-infected leaves was also quite high, making detailed comparisons difficult.Toconfirm the functionality of the \u03b5 SIP molecules, TGEV neutralization assays were performed. The results obtained with the plant extracts were compared with the neutralization obtained with mammalian cell-expressed human \u03b5 SIP (hueSIP) and ascitic fluid containing the original 6A.C3 mAb (positive controls), as well as with supernatants from mammalian cells expressing a SIP molecule of irrelevant specificity (negative control). The results obtained with the PVX constructs mirrored those of the binding assay, with the highest level of neutralization being obtained with extracts from N. clevelandii leaves infected with PVX-hueSIP (Figure 3b). Substantially higher levels of neutralization, similar to those found with both the original 6A.C3 mAb and \u03b5 SIP derived from it, were found in extracts of cowpea leaves infected with CPMV-hueSIP (Figure 3b). In contrast with the binding assay, only low levels of neutralization were observed with extracts from wildtype CPMV-infected leaves. The lower levels of neutralization obtained with the PVX samples relative to the CPMV samples are consistent with the significantly lower levels of \u03b5 SIP expression found in the former. As expected, negligible neutralization was observed when a SIP molecule of irrelevant specificity was analysed. The results confirmed that the \u03b5 SIP molecules expressed in plants retained both their ability to bind to and neutralize TGEV. In vivo protection of pigs To assess the ability of the plant-expressed \u03b5SIP molecules to protect pigs against challenge with TGEV, extracts were made from N. clevelandii or cowpea leaves infected with the constructs showing the highest levels of neutralization (PVX-hueSIP and CPMV-hueSIP, respectively) and from leaves infected with parental vectors. The binding and neutralization activities of the lyophilized extracts were reconfirmed before supplying them to the animals. Lyophilized samples retained 60%\u221270% of the specific neutralizing activity (relative to total protein content) relative to the fresh plant extracts. The loss of neutralizing activity, probably a result of the repeated freeze-thaw treatments, was similar for all samples within one experiment. The lyophilized plant extracts were reconstituted with water, mixed with milk and supplied orally to the piglets, which were simultaneously challenged with TGEV. Previous experiments (M. Bestagno et al., in preparation) have shown that supplying supernatants from mammalian cells containing \u03b5SIP molecules simultaneously with a TGEV challenge yields results similar to those achieved when the \u03b5SIP-containing extract is supplied prior to challenge. Thus, the observed decrease in virus titre is not a result of virus neutralization prior to administration. As controls piglets were supplied with either \u03b5SIP expressed in mammalian cells or the 6A.C3 antibody from which it was derived, or with the corresponding null supernatants. Following further administration of the extracts over a 2-day period, TGEV levels in the lung and gut were determined and expressed as a ratio of the virus titre obtained with antibody-containing extract relative to the equivalent extract without antibody (Figure 4). The results showed that supplying pigs orally with milk containing plant extracts from N. clevelandii or cowpea plants expressing \u03b5SIP caused a clear decrease in virus titre in both the gut and lung compared with extracts from leaves infected with the parental virus (Figure 4). This decrease correlated with a decrease in the number of pulmonary lesions observed. The decrease in virus titre obtained with extracts from cowpea",

            "text": "results presented here show that plant-expressed SIP molecules retain their ability to dimerize and can neutralize TGEV infections of cells in culture. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to protect newborn farm animals against TGEV by providing them with milk containing crude extracts of plant tissue expressing SIP molecules. We chose to use the decrease in TGEV titre in gut and lung, the two main target organs for the virus, rather than the clinical symptoms of infection, such as diarrhoea, as a marker for protection, as this is a much more specific assay. Gastroenteritis, although a clinical manifestation of TGEV infections, is a common episode in newborn animals and can result from unrelated infections or even from the artificial feeding protocols necessary for the in vivo experiments. Although virus accumulation was not totally abolished in the in vivo experiments, the virus titres recovered after administration of plant-expressed \u03b5SIP (< 10 4.5 ) were below the threshold previously shown to be necessary to induce diarrhoea and death in newborn animals. In contrast with diarrhoea, histopathological lesions, such as interstitial pneumonia and atrophy of intestinal villi, are specific signs associated with TGEV infection. Histopathological examination of tissues from piglets treated with the mAb 6A.C3 or cowpea extracts containing \u03b5SIP revealed that these signs were absent. In contrast, both signs were evident in animals who received no specific antibody (data not shown).These results indicate that both the parental mAb 6A.C3 and plant-expressed \u03b5SIP prevent the appearance of lesions associated with disease. Therefore, the administration of plantexpressed \u03b5SIP can be anticipated to afford protection against TGEV. We are therefore convinced that we have established the proof of principle that the protection of mammals against virus infection can be afforded by the oral administration of crude plant extracts containing virus-neutralizing antibody derivatives.",

Agrobacterium GV3101 cultures carrying pGR106 vectors were pelleted and resuspended to room temperature for 2 h. Approximately 150 \u00b5L of the Agrobacterium suspension was applied with a syringe to the underside of three leaves of young N. clevelandii plants. Passaging was carried out by inoculating fresh N. clevelandii plants with sap from agroinoculated plants. In the case of pBinP-YP2, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) plants were co-inoculated with bacteria containing pBinPS1NT to provide RNA-1 for virus multiplication. For passaging, virus in the sap of agroinoculated leaves was first concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (Mechtcheriakova et al., 2006). Immunological detection of \u03b5SIP expression in leaf tissue Total protein was extracted from frozen powdered leaves using a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.0, 10 mM potassium acetate and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
