Generalised PI has been extensively described in the veterinary literature, particularly in cases of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (\nWeiss & Scott\n1981\n,\nKipar et al.\n2005\n). Cutaneous, subcutaneous and, more rarely, systemic PI in cats is mainly associated with mycobacteria and fungal infections (\nMalik et al.\n1992\n,\n1994\n,\n2000\n,\nBr\u00f6mel & Sykes\n2005\n,\nBaral et al.\n2006\n) with sporadic implication of Actinomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, Francisella, Bartonella and Leishmania (\nPatel\n2002\n;\nValentine et al.\n2004\n;\nMalik et al.\n2006\n; Farias et al., 2007; Santero et al.\n2008\n;\nSharman et al.\n2009\n;\nVaranat et al.\n2012\n;\nTraslavina et al.\n2015\n). Idiopathic sterile pyogranulomatous dermatitis has also been described in cats (\nScott et al.\n1990\n). We describe the clinical presentation and outcome of three cases of feline idiopathic sterile pyogranuloma with different presentation and locations, but with the common picture of a mass with no superficial skin involvement. To our knowledge sterile pyogranuloma with mass appearance and absence of skin involvement have not previously been described in cats.\n",

The biopsies were taken from two different sites within the mass to increase the chances of collecting a representative sample and were immediately submitted for histopathology. Due to the high suspicion of neoplasia, tissue samples for culture were not taken and no antibiotics or other types of treatment were started. Microscopic examination exhibited severe pyogranulomatous and lymphocytic cellulitis and mild pyogranulomatous and lymphocytic myositis (\nFig.\n2\na, b\n). There was no evidence of neoplasia in any of the samples examined. No infectious etiological agents could be detected following Gram, Ziehl Nielsen (ZN) and Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Immunohistochemistry for coronavirus FIPV3\u201070 anti\u2010feline coronavirus antibodies (\nTammer et al.\n1995\n) was negative. The sample was sent for pan\u2010fungal (ITS1\u2010ITS2 region of ribosomal DNA) as previously published (\nLau et al.\n2007\n) and mycobacteria PCR assay (mycobacterial ITS1\u2010ITS2 regions) on the paraffin block sample as previously published (\nHughes et al.\n1997\n,\nFyfe et al.\n2008\n) both of which were negative. Bacterial 16s RNA probe FISH analysis for eubacteria was negative (\nMaunder et al.\n2016\n). On clinical examination the mass remained of similar size for the following 2 months but the sneezing became more frequent. Prednisolone treatment was started at 1 mg/kg daily orally and the mass reduced in size and the sneezing markedly improved, the same dose of prednisolone was continued for 12 months until last follow\u2010up. The cat was still alive at the time of writing 12 months after presentation and the facial swelling and the sneezing resolved almost completely.\n",

The referring veterinary surgeon detected the mass as an incidental finding when the cat presented for annual booster vaccination. The patient did not have any history of previous illness and the owner did not report any current problems or clinical signs; the cat was otherwise fit and well. On abdominal palpation a non\u2010painful, firm, partially mobile mass was present in the mid\u2010caudal abdomen. At this stage, considering the size of the mass in the abdomen and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis was neoplasia although FIP, fungal and mycobacterial granuloma were also considered. CBC and biochemistry were unremarkable apart from mild hyperglobulinaemia 54 g/L (reference interval 24 to 47). FIV antibody and FeLV antigen tests were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous mass with mixed echogenicity and no other abnormalities. The mass measured approximately 5\u00d74 cm, and was thought to originate from the mesenteric lymph node. Cytology of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of liver and spleen taken to rule out the possibility of related disease in those organs was unremarkable. An FNA of the mass revealed PI with mixed, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, infiltrates. An ultrasound\u2010guided Tru\u2010cut biopsy of the mass was obtained under general anaesthesia, which confirmed the lesion to be pyogranulomatous. In view of the continued high suspicion of neoplasia, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. The mass was confirmed to originate from the mesenteric lymph node and could not be resected without damage to the intestinal blood supply. Multiple wedge biopsies were obtained to submit for culture and histopathology. Histopathological examination showed a pyogranulomatous and necrotising lymphadenitis, with fibrosis. No aetiological agents were visible on Gram, ZN and PAS staining. Immunohistochemistry for coronavirus (FIPV3\u201070 anti\u2010feline coronavirus antibodies) was also negative. The sample was sent for pan\u2010fungal PCR (ITS1\u2010ITS2 region of ribosomal DNA) on paraffin tissue block and mycobacteria PCR (Mycobacterial ITS region) on frozen sample that were both negative. Bacterial 16s RNA probe FISH analysis for eubacteria was negative. Due to the incidental finding and its asymptomatic nature it was decided to monitor the mass and no treatment was given. The mass remained of similar size and no clinical signs related to it were ever reported. The cat was still alive and well almost 2 years after diagnosis when she died in a road traffic accident.\n",

The mass was first noticed by the owner 5 months previously when it was approximately 3 cm in diameter; the mass was not painful and there were no associated clinical signs. The patient was treated by the referring veterinarian with a 7\u2010day course of meloxicam and amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid with no improvement. On presentation the cat was still clinically well and the owner did not report any problems or clinical signs except for the mass. It was suspected to be neoplastic and thoracic radiography and a wedge biopsy sample were taken under general anaesthesia. Thoracic radiography showed focal mineralisation of the left caudal lung lobe \u2013 considered an incidental finding \u2013 but was otherwise unremarkable. The histopathological diagnosis was marked pyogranulomatous and lymphocytic cellulitis with mild myositis and no evidence of neoplasia. The mass continued to grow and, neoplasia remained high on the differential list, so the mass was surgically resected. The second histopathology report confirmed the previous diagnosis of a pyogranuloma, and no aetiological agents could be found with PAS, Gram and ZN staining. PCR and culture for Mycobacteria were performed on frozen (stored at \u221280\u00b0C) and fresh tissue, respectively, and were both negative. A pan\u2010fungal PCR (ITS1\u2010ITS2 region of ribosomal DNA) on paraffin block tissue was also negative except for isolation of \u201c\nCandida albicans.\u201d Although this was most likely a contaminant, the patient was prescribed a 3\u2010month course of itraconazole. One month later new numerous nodules non\u2010associated with the previous removed mass were found in the lymphatic chain of the neck, together with an enlarged prescapular lymph node, but there was no regrowth of the previous removed granuloma. MRI confirmed the presence of the nodules in the neck and an enlarged right prescapular lymph node; no other abnormalities were found. Radiography of the thorax and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable. The prescapular lymph node and three nodules in the neck were removed for diagnostic purposes. Histopathology confirmed the presence of pyogranulomatous cellulitis and myositis, with mild dermal fibrosis and pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis. No aetiological agents could be found despite repeated examination using PAS, Gram and ZN stains. Tissue culture, pan\u2010fungal and mycobacteria PCR were again negative. Immunohistochemistry for coronavirus antigen (FIPV3\u201070 anti\u2010feline coronavirus antibodies) and 16s RNA probe FISH analysis for eubacteria were performed and were both negative. The lesions remained unchanged for the following 3 weeks and a dose of prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks was prescribed but produced no improvement. The dose was increased to 3 mg/kg for the following 2 weeks, reducing to 2 mg/kg for the following month. Despite the initial lack of response, the lesions markedly improved and completely disappeared over the following 2 months. The prednisolone was gradually reduced and stopped. At the time of writing the cat was still asymptomatic and no recurrence of the lesions has been documented, more than 1 year after initial presentation.\n",
