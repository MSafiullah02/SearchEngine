More than half of the obstetrician\u2013gynecologists responding to our survey (52.9%) indicated that an evolutionary perspective is important or very important for public health (Table 2). There are many public health issues with strong links to evolution. For example, given the relevance of climate change in the context of disease, most recently as a purported element in the spread of Zika virus [20], understanding the future implications of evolution in the field of medicine is vital to addressing emergent health care concerns [21].",

The rapid rise and broad extent of current antibiotic resistance is due to several factors, one intrinsic to bacteria (horizontal gene transfer) but the others are human factors. Horizontal gene transfer, the transfer of genetic material between different microbial taxa, greatly enhances the ability of resistance genes to spread. But, the primary culprit for the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance is the overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics by people, especially the wide-spread use of antibiotics in the food animal business [22]. However, the advent of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is predicted to occur by evolutionary theory, even if antibiotics are used in judicious and appropriate ways. For example, the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea used to be easily and quickly cured by penicillin. Now the only effective treatment is a two-drug cocktail of third-generation antibiotics [23], and there are worrying signs of resistance to these may be developing.",

Air pollution is associated with increased risks of respiratory tract infections and cardiovascular disease [24, 25] and has also been shown to be associated with preterm birth and early miscarriage [26, 27]. The One Health concept integrates the essential connections between human health and disease and both animal and environmental health [28]. The combination of the degradation of the environment, spreading pandemics associated with increased human and domestic animal contact with wild animals (e.g. COVID-19), and climate change altering, and in many cases, expanding the geographic ranges of disease vectors, has led global public health to adopt the One Health concept. One Health is intrinsically evolutionary in its theory and practice.",

            "text": "A healthy vaginal microbiome confers many advantages, most of which are not fully understood. The study of the vaginal microbiome should inform and guide practice in areas such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) and other infections of the lower reproductive tract. BV, a common problem among women of child-bearing age with a US prevalence ranging from 6.1% to 51.4% in high-risk populations [29], is at its core a disease of microbiome dysbiosis. The normal vaginal microbial community has been disrupted leading to overgrowth of pathogenic or at least noncommensal microorganisms [30], which can increase the risks for health issues such as a woman\u2019s vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and during pregnancy, premature birth and fetal loss [31]. Often used characteristics to screen for BV are a vaginal pH > 4.5 [32] and a low prevalence of Lactobacillus species among the vaginal microbiota [33]. However, these characteristics exist in asymptomatic healthy women, especially among women of African descent and of Hispanic origin [34]. Interestingly, the vaginal communities of asymptomatic women that contained few, if any, Lactobacillus species had other lactic acid-producing species, suggesting that the production of lactic acid may be the important functional role of the human vaginal microbiome [35, 36]. The human vaginal microbiome appears to be unique in being dominated by Lactobacillus or other lactic acid-producing species, as these are not found in the vaginal microbiomes of nonhuman primates including our closest relative, the chimpanzee [37]. Understanding the coevolution of the human vaginal microbiome is likely to produce important insights into vaginal and neonatal health.",

The vertical transmission (mother-to-neonate) of a healthy microbiome has significant effects on the health and wellbeing of the neonate that last into adult life [38]. However, currently in the USA, 32% of deliveries are by cesarean section [39]. Those babies miss much of the initial inoculation by maternal microbes and differ in their early gut microbiome from that of infants born by vaginal delivery. Infants born by cesarean section are also at greater risk for later adverse conditions such as obesity and asthma and there are convincing links between these risks and the early life microbiome [40]. Pilot research on vaginal seeding has shown some promise [41] but has inherent risks as well [42]. A proportion of high-risk pregnancies will always necessitate cesarean delivery, but an evolutionary perspective (and the expanding work on microbiomes) suggests that women (and providers) should be informed of the potential risks to their infant\u2019s later health due to elective cesarean.",

The evidence for the benefits of breastfeeding over formula is well established and supported by fundamental mammalian reproductive adaptations relevant to child and maternal health. Milk is full of maternal immune cells, immune function molecules, hormones, cytokines and growth factors [47, 48]. This chemical signaling has played a critical role in all mammalian species in connecting mother and offspring during what we call the \u2018fourth trimester\u2019 in humans. Human milk also contains an extensive diversity of oligosaccharides, some of which have antimicrobial properties while others serve as prebiotics, providing food for beneficial microbes in the neonatal gut [48].",

One benefit of a coevolved microbiome is that it acts to reduce the ability of pathogenic organisms to colonize. This has led to several studies of the effectiveness of probiotics to treat and prevent mastitis in dairy cattle [51\u201354] and two published studies in women, one for treatment [55] and one for prevention of mastitis [56]. However, not all dairy cattle studies have shown a positive effect of probiotics [57], and both papers on women have been questioned concerning methodology and the appropriateness of the outcomes measured [58]. Despite the lack of evidence, providers may have to be ready to counsel patients regarding the use of probiotics for mastitis, as probiotic treatments for prevention and treatment of mastitis in women are already on the market [58]. Here an evolutionary perspective would counsel caution. We do not fully understand the function and effects of the milk microbiome, nor how it is established and maintained. Manipulations to modify it may have unintended consequences and cannot be assumed to be benign.",

In a 2003 survey of North American medical school deans, fewer than half of the participants believed that evolutionary biology was vital in the education of physicians [59]. Fewer than a third of schools were found to have covered at least half of the core topics in evolutionary biology, and even fewer schools had faculty with a PhD in evolutionary biology [59]. The main reasons offered for not adding evolution to the curriculum in medical schools were time constraints and a lack of faculty members who have the requisite expertise to teach the subject. Ten years after this initial survey of deans, a 2013 survey found that there has been an expanded teaching of evolution in medical schools, despite concerns of inciting controversy upon adding evolution to the curriculum [60].",
