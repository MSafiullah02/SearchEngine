It runs a relentless clinical course with end-stage renal failure in 35\u201340 % of patients after 25\u201330 years\u2019 follow-up [1]. The disease is characterized by mesangial deposition of polymeric IgA1 (pIgA) [2], followed by proliferation of mesangial cells, increased synthesis of extracellular matrix and infiltration of immune cells [3]. The absence of known IgA receptors in podocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) and the lack of IgA binding to these cells support the pathologic finding that IgA is only deposited in the mesangium in IgAN [4, 5]. The most important question is how mesangial IgA deposits lead to damage of other components of the nephron and, ultimately, lead to renal failure.",

            "text": "We identify a novel mechanism involving a glomerulo-tubular crosstalk in the development of tubulointerstitial damage in IgAN [5]. Mediators released from mesangial cells after IgA deposition activate TEC and cause subsequent inflammatory changes in the renal interstitium. Podocytes are positioned strategically along the glomerulo-tubular axis, yet their role in mediating the glomerulo-tubular crosstalk in IgAN has not been addressed. We have previously demonstrated that podocytes play a contributory role in the development of interstitial damage in IgAN by amplifying the activation of TEC with enhanced TNF-\u03b1 synthesis following inflammatory changes of HMC [4]. We have also shown that humoral factors, predominantly as tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b2) released by HMC following IgA deposition down-regulated the expression of nephrin and ezrin in cultured podocytes [6]. Alteration of these podocytic membrane proteins affects the function of podocytes in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to heavy proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and loss of kidney function [7, 8]. Furthermore, persistence of podocyte injury may activate cascades of cellular and immune processes that lead to irreversible cellular damage, which induces podocyte cell death or the detachment of podocytes from the GBM, and ultimately leads to glomerulosclerosis and kidney failure.",

ANG-(1\u20139) counteracts the proinflammatory actions of AngII. It has been suggested that podocytes play a specific role in the maintenance of intraglomerular RAS balance [9]. Nonetheless, these enzymatic activities are altered in non-physiological environment such as hyperglycemia that mimics diabetic kidney disease [9, 15]. We have shown here that neither AngII release, nor the expression of enzymes that controlling the formation or degradation of AngII, changes in podocytes following IgA-HMC media incubation. However, there were significant increases in the expression level of AT1R and PRR. We have previously documented a glomerular-tubular crosstalk triggered by mesangial IgA deposition activates the up-regulation of AT1R in TEC and leads to the tubulointerstitial damage [16]. A similar up-regulation of AT1R in podocytes associated with mesangial IgA deposition was observed in the current study, and this up-regulated AT1R expression is controlled by podocytic TNF-\u03b1/TNFR1 axis through signal from NF\u03baB activation. Despite a link between TNFR1 activation by TNF-\u03b1 and AT1R up-regulation has not yet been reported in podocytes, data generated from cardiac fibroblasts culture depicted that TNF-\u03b1 up-regulates AT1R density and enhance the pro-fibrotic effect of AngII [17]. In addition, activation of NF\u03baB is essential for the AT1R up-regulation by TNF-\u03b1 in cardiac fibroblast [18]. That piece of evidence from cardiac fibroblast may provide intriguing possibility that similar mechanism may take place on podocytes, which deserves further investigation.",

AngII induces apoptosis in rat podocytes with up-regulation of the expression of Fas, FasL, and Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression [21]. Hypertensive rats induced by continuous AngII infusion show podocytic apoptosis associated with decreased nephrin expression [22]. The slit diaphragm protein nephrin play a pivotal role in preventing passage of protein through the glomerular barrier [23]. In human study, a marked reduction of nephrin mRNA and extracellular nephrin was detected in IgAN but not in minimal change nephropathy (MCN) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [24]. Podocyte loss is associated with the increased disease severity in IgAN and contributes to the progressive glomerular sclerosis and filtration failure [25]. Consistent with these results, our current data demonstrated IgA-HMC media induced apoptosis and reduced nephrin expression by podocyte. Unlike the results obtained from rodent experiments, our data from human podocytes culture showed that the podocytic apoptosis was independent of AngII up-regulation, but associated with increased AT1R expression and the activation of TNFR1/TNF-\u03b1 axis. Our present data from the blockade experiments have suggested that the up-regulated expression of AT1R in podocytes is only partially responsible for the apoptotic response towards activation by IgA-HMC media, some additional mechanisms must therefore be involved.",

The binding of prorenin to the prorenin receptor not only causes a non-proteolytic activation of prorenin leading to the activation of the RAS, but also stimulates the receptor\u2019s own intracellular signaling pathways independent of the RAS. Within the kidney, PRR is present in the glomerular mesangium and podocytes, which play an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Angiotensin-independent effects of prorenin activation have been reported. Renin and prorenin induced TGF-\u03b2 release in mesangial cells in the presence of renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors and/or AT1 receptor antagonists [27, 28]. Interestingly, our present data have shown that other than AT1R, expression of PRR was also up-regulated by IgA-HMC media. This up-regulated PRR expression elicited the downstream events including increased CTGF synthesis and podocytic apoptosis. However, the up-regulated podocytic CTGF synthesis and apoptosis by IgA-HMC media was not solely PRR dependent, the AT1R up-regulation by IgA-HMC media also contributed noticeably to these process as described earlier. CTGF is a crucial effector for the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis [29]. CTGF is mainly expressed in podocytes and its expression is markedly up-regulated and associated with fibrotic lesions [30]. Overexpression of CTGF in murine podocytes exacerbates proteinuria and through a functional impairment and loss of podocytes [31]. High glucose stimulates mesangial cells to secrete TGF-\u03b2, which is stored on cell surface of podocytes as latent inactive form. The latent TGF-\u03b2 is activated by AngII dependent process to induce podocytic CTGF synthesis and contributes to the podocytic apoptosis [32]. In rat mesangial cells, high glucose increases expression of PRR, and leads to the enhanced production of CTGF [33, 34]. We have previously demonstrated that pIgA from IgAN patient increased TGF-\u03b2 production by HMC via increased AngII [35]. In the present study, we observed the up-regulation of podocytic PRR, CTGF and apoptosis in podocytes by IgA-HMC media. Taken together, it is logical to postulate that in IgAN, similar mechanism to that in diabetic nephropathy, in which the loss of podocyte involving the activation of the mesangial-podocytic axis through TGF-\u03b2-PRR-CTGF is operating.",

However, there are limitations in the present study. Clinical evidences demonstrating how the dysregulated expression of TNF-\u03b1, TNFR1, AT1R, PRR, CTGF lead to podocytic apoptosis in IgAN patients are lacking. Furthermore, it would be very important to test the protective role of dual blockade of AT1R and PRR using an appropriate animal model, and warrants further investigation.",

Humoral mediators released from the glomerular mesangium following IgA deposition induced TNF-\u03b1 synthesis by the podocytes. The released TNF-\u03b1 may amplify its own production in an autocrine manner. TNF-\u03b1 up-regulated the expression of podocytic TNF receptors and AT1R through a NF\u03baB dependent mechanism. This TNF-\u03b1/TNFR1/AT1R axis leads to further apoptosis and nephrin reduction in podocyte. Humoral mediators released from the glomerular mesangium following IgA deposition also lead to enhanced PRR expression and CTGF production which is controlled by the activation of latent TGF-\u03b2 on the podocyte. This PRR/CTGF axis leads to podocytic apoptosis and nephrin reduction through activation of notch1. Furthermore, AT1R activation also triggers the CTGF production by podocytes and forming a link between the two axes of podocytic apoptosis induction. Dual blockade of activation of NF\u03baB and notch1 is essential to abolish the podocytic damage following mesangial pIgA deposition.\n",
