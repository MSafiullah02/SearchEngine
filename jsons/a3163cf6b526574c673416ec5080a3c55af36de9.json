Using an in vitro approach we dissected the triggering requirements of B cells and unveiled a distinct role for TLRs in the activation of naive versus memory B cells. Using an ex vivo approach we analyzed the dynamics of memory B cells and ASCs and the kinetics of serum antibodies during secondary immune responses and in steady state conditions and used these quantitative data to build up a model of serological memory. According to this model memory B cells behave as 'stem cells' capable of generating plasma cells and antibodies in an antigen-dependent as well as in an antigen-independent fashion. Finally we developed an efficient method to interrogate human memory B cells and to isolate human monoclonal antibodies. This method can be exploited for the production of neutralizing antibodies for serotherapy and for ''analytic vaccinology''.",

            "text": "Introduction T-cell-dependent antibody responses are initiated when B cells receive stimulatory signals from the antigen-triggered B-cell receptor (BCR) and CD40, which is triggered by CD40L upregulated on T-helper cells upon cognate interaction with B cells. Productive signaling events lead to B-cell expansion, to the generation of short-lived antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and, following the germinal center reaction, to high-affinity memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells (1) (2) (3) (4) . Soon after antigenic stimulation, serum antibodies reach a peak level and are subsequently maintained at lower but constant levels for a lifetime. The maintenance of serum antibody level after immunization, also defined as 'serological memory', is the desirable output of vaccination, because it provides immediate protection against pathogens or toxins. The cellular bases of this phenomenon, however, remain to be defined. Below we review data from our laboratory regarding the activation requirements of naive and memory B cells and the in vivo dynamics of memory B cells, ASCs, and serum antibodies during an immune response and in the steady state. We also discuss a model of serological memory based on memory B cells and their capacity to proliferate and differentiate to ASCs in response to antigen-independent environmental signals. We finally illustrate an example of how memory B cells can be interrogated and exploited to make human monoclonal antibodies.",

The results of these early studies have been subsequently confirmed and extended by other laboratories (9, 10) . More recently, we found that memory B cells constitutively express Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR6, TLR7, TLR9, and TLR10 and, when triggered by the corresponding TLR agonists, such as CpG or R848, proliferate and differentiate to ASCs (11, 12) . Differences among memory B-cell subsets were observed. For instance, IgM memory B cells were able to respond to CpG in the absence of cytokines, while switch memory B cells did so only in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15. In contrast, naive B cells did not express TLRs constitutively and did not respond directly to microbial products. However, they rapidly upregulated TLRs upon BCR stimulation (12) . These data suggested that microbial products play a role in memory B-cell homeostasis.",

            "text": "Using the ABCB1 marker to isolate highly pure populations of human naive B cells (6), we recently addressed the requirements for naive B-cell activation (13) . We found that BCR triggering (by anti-Ig) and cognate T-cell help (provided by CD4 + T cells recognizing a superantigen on B cells) were not sufficient to induce full cell expansion and differentiation. The accumulation of proliferating B cells, isotypic switch to IgG and IgA, and differentiation to ASCs required a third signal that was efficiently delivered by agonists that triggered any of the TLRs that are upregulated in naive B cells upon BCR triggering. TLR agonists acted directly on B cells and were required irrespective of the nature of T-helper cells present. Supernatants of dendritic cells (DCs) stimulated by DC-specific TLR agonists were also capable of enhancing B-cell responses, although to a much lower and variable extent. The requirement for TLR engagement for human naive B-cell activation is consistent with a recent report in the mouse system (14) . However, it is worth noting that there are important differences both in the pattern and in the regulation of TLR expression between humans and mice. For instance, mouse naive B cells constitutively express TLRs and proliferate in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (15) or CpG (16) in the absence of antigenic stimuli. The coupling of BCR stimulation to TLR expression endows the human immune system with a high degree of specificity, because it allows focusing of innate signals only on antigen-stimulated naive B cells.",

A striking example is the fact that serum antibodies to vaccinia virus (22) , as well as vaccinia virus-specific memory B cells (23) , are still detected more than 50 years after vaccination, in spite of the fact that this virus is highly cytopathic, is non-persistent, and does not circulate in the population. Several considerations suggest that the longevity of plasma cells and/or persistence of antigen are not sufficient to account for the extraordinary longevity of human serological memory. For instance, if human plasma cells were to survive for a lifetime, then their mass (and consequently total serum Ig levels) should increase steadily with the age of the individual, a phenomenon that is not observed. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that upon booster immunization, newly formed ASCs displace old plasma cells from the bone marrow (24) . This finding is consistent with a substantial turnover of plasma cells in the bone marrow dependent on antigenic stimulation and to competition for survival niches between resident plasma cells and new plasma cells migrating to the bone marrow from the periphery.",

By combining two quantitative assays to measure the amount of serum IgG and the frequency of IgGproducing memory B cells in the blood, we found that under steady state-conditions (i.e. at least one year after antigenic boost), there was a striking correlation between the frequency of antigen-specific B cells in the memory pool and the antigen-specific IgG levels in serum (11) . This correlation was found for different antigens and in individuals that have wide distribution of serum antibodies and memory B cells following a standard vaccination. This observation suggested that under steady-state conditions, memory B cells, plasma cells, and antibodies are part of a homeostatic system and maintain their pool size by continual division and differentiation in the absence of antigen. Below we review evidence for this homeostatic maintenance of serological memory.",

First, antigen boosting induces a rapid increase in serum antibodies that was sustained only for a few months. This is in contrast to the mouse system, where serum antibodies are maintained constant at peak levels for about a year. Second, most of the antigen-induced ASCs, which are responsible for the rapid increase in serum antibodies, are short lived and are eliminated, as no further increase is observed after day 10. If, however, all ASCs were short lived, serum antibody levels should start to decline on day 10 with a half-life of approximately 20 days, which is the half-life of human IgG1, the predominant isotype induced by Additional quantitative parameters could be estimated from a typical secondary response to TT. The total serum IgG1 concentration of 10 mg/ml and a half-life of 20 days allow us to estimate a synthetic rate of $250 mg/ml/day. Thus, approximately 100 mg of anti-TT-specific IgG1 antibodies are produced in two days (from day 6 to day 7) by short-lived ASCs. Based on the assumption that the half-life of all bone marrow plasma cells is the same of that of TT-specific plasma cells, that is approximately 40 days, and therefore their turnover is 1% per day, it is estimated that on day 12 after boost, 1-2% of bone marrow plasma cells are TT specific and produce 2.5-5 mg/ml/day of anti-TT antibody. This rate of production is sufficient to sustain serum antibody levels in the plateau phase (when antibodies produced by short-lived ASCs are replaced by those synthesized by long-lived plasma cells) and is consistent with the subsequent decline phase due to the turnover of long-lived plasma cells.",

Protection is relative to a particular pathogen and may be mediated by preformed antibodies, by antibodies that are rapidly produced by ASCs derived from proliferating memory B cells, or by a combination of both. In the case of toxins, there is often no time to mount a secondary proliferative response, and therefore protection relies entirely on pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. The serological response described above showed that a high level of antibodies can be induced within a week after antigenic boosting and is maintained for a few months. High numbers of memory B cells are not required for this secondary antibody response. Indeed, we found that the magnitude of the antibody response does not correlate with the frequency of existing antigen-specific memory B cells, but rather it is inversely correlated with the preboost antibody level (E. Traggiai, unpublished data). This finding is consistent with the negative feedback effect of existing antibodies on secondary responses (28) . In contrast, high numbers of memory B cells are required to sustain serum antibodies over a period of several years. Therefore to induce long-lived protection, vaccines should generate memory B cells at frequencies that are high enough to maintain protective antibody levels. This frequency is achieved upon natural infection or immunization with live vaccines, such as vaccinia virus. In contrast, 'weak' immunogens, such as protein antigens, are very poor inducers of memory B cells, and repetitive immunization appears to be required to increase memory Bcell frequency up to an appropriate level.",

Monoclonal antibodies represent an ideal alternative to hyperimmune sera (29) . They can be produced by immortalizing memory B cells with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or by fusing a B cell with an appropriate partner cell to produce hybridomas. These methods, which have been used (30) (31) (32) , have a very low efficiency, and therefore alternative strategies have been developed. These alternatives include the humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies through protein engineering (33) , the selection of antibodies from phage display libraries of human antibody fragments (34) , and the immunization of transgenic mice carrying human Ig loci, followed by the production of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology (35) . Although these methods have led to the development of several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against cytokines or surface molecules, their impact on infectious disease therapy has been less pronounced (36) . Indeed, the number of therapeutic antibodies against infectious agents is still limited, and only one is currently in use to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in newborns (37) .",

The activation of naive B cells (left) requires the integration of three signals: signal 1 delivered by antigen through B-cell receptor (BCR), signal 2 delivered by antigen-specific T-helper cells via CD40 following cognate interaction, and signal 3 delivered by microbial products acting on Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Note that naive B cells do not express TLRs, which are induced by signal 1. The activation of memory B cells (right) can be effectively triggered in the absence of BCR stimulation via TLRs or bystander T-cell help.",

Upon antigenic boosting (upper panels), specific memory B cells selectively proliferate and differentiate generating a burst of ASCs (measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assay analysis) that peaks on day 6 and day 7. In the absence of antigen (lower panels), all memory B cells turn over at low rate and continually spill out ASCs of all memory specificities. In this condition, there is a good correlation between the frequency of memory B cells and serum antibody levels. Shown are tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific ASCs 6 days and 10 years after a booster immunization.TT vaccination. The sustenance of serum antibody after day 10 indicates that some cells are rescued in the bone marrow as long-lived plasma cells.A relevant question at this point is what is the half-life of human plasma cells in the bone marrow. If these cells live forever, the antibody they produce should accumulate in the serum for several days until a plateau is reached, where the rate of synthesis equals the rate of degradation. Alternatively, if they have a long yet limited lifespan, the antibody they produce should accumulate initially and then decline as the cells die. The experimental data on the kinetics of serum antibodies and ASCs allow us to estimate that the half-life of human plasma cells generated during an immune response (and by extrapolation of all long-lived plasma cells) is approximately 40 days.",
