Antibodies are glycosylated protein molecules present on the surface of B cells (surface immunoglobulins) serving as antigen receptors (BCR) or are secreted into the extracellular space where they can bind and neutralize their target antigens [17]. A single antibody molecule consists of four protein chains: two \u201cheavy\u201d (H chains) and two \u201clight\u201d (L chains) linked to each other by disulfide bonds. The N-terminus regions of the heavy and light chains, which collectively make up the antigen-binding site, are where the variability between one antibody molecule and another resides, hence determining specificity. An important feature is that each antibody recognizes a specific antigen, a phenomenon called \"antibody specificity.\u201d For example, an antibody that recognizes the mumps virus cannot recognize the measles virus and can only recognize one particular binding site on the mumps virus. There will likely be multiple antibodies to multiple different binding sites on an antigen such as a virus. For example, some antibodies to COVID-19 will target binding sites on proteins in the outer shell while some may target nucleic acid binding sites, but each will be specific and unique. Only when two different, but similar, viruses have identical structures will cross-reactivity occur. For example, if multiple strains of a coronavirus have maintained regions of nucleic acid that have not undergone mutation, an antibody that targets that region in one may target the identical region in another. Conversely, an antibody that recognizes the measles virus generally cannot recognize the mumps virus.",

It should be noted that there are four subclasses or isotypes of IgG antibodies (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), the distinction of which is beyond the scope of this discussion.

It is also important in binding to bacterial toxins and is the primary mechanism for protection conferred by successful vaccination.2)Antibodies facilitate phagocytosis of foreign substances by phagocytic cells (opsonization). Antibody binding, for example, will not prevent bacterial replication.

This feature is called \"immunological memory.\" One of the most significant features of the immune response is its ability to retain a memory of previous infections, and this is also the principal behind the effectiveness of vaccinations. This both protects individuals from reinfection and limits the spread of infection in a community. Immune memory can be very long-lasting; immunological memory for the measles infection in adults decays so slowly, it would take over 3,000 years to decrease by half. This therefore goes well beyond life-long protection for this particular antigen. These robust durable changes are the reason that, when we vaccinate, the protection this produces delivers long-term benefits. Within an individual, immune memory must be distributed throughout the body. Circulating antibodies travel in the blood, reaching everywhere the circulation does including extracellular spaces and in secretions. Natural killer (NK) cells can remain on guard within tissues \u201calert\u201d but not activated, ready to attack rapidly if reinfection occurs. NK cells are activated in response to macrophage-derived cytokines and they serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can clear the infection. NK cells work to control viral infections by secreting interferon gamma and TNF\u03b1 while also stimulating NK cells nearby with such secretions and destroying physiologically challenged cells due to viral infection or malignancy through complex mechanisms outside the scope of this review.",

By detecting the presence of viral genetic material in the nasal, oral and respiratory tracts one can determine if a patient is actively shedding virus which can be spread to others. These tests are perhaps of greatest utility early in the course of infection as they can confirm viral presence up to 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Given that antibodies may not be detectable until 6-7 days after symptom onset, molecular tests can accelerate the diagnostic window by up to 9 days. The duration of viral shedding can be highly variable and depend upon severity of symptoms, length of illness and patient-specific immune response. Generally speaking, viral shedding is undetectable 21 to 35 days after symptom onset or 3 to 5 days after a patient becomes asymptomatic. At the end of the disease course, viral load ultimately becomes undetectable and therefore a molecular test will not detect a prior infection, even one that has recently resolved. While point of care molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 are becoming more widely available with faster result times, all currently available tests require a laboratory analyzer platform which are generally in short supply and on back order for several months. There remains a backlog of samples for molecular testing at many labs and public health officials have put in place strict guidelines requiring severe symptoms in order to qualify to receive a molecular test.",

Furthermore, while never a primary diagnostic tool, antibody status can be used to aid the clinical diagnosis of suspected non-critical cases that present 7 days or more after the start of symptoms.

These testing methodologies rely on the antigen-antibody binding affinity described above. The test principle relies on a recombinant antigen produced in the laboratory which is designed to mimic specific structures of the virus, causing any antibodies present in whole blood or serum with a binding affinity to attach to the antigen. The specificity of the test can be highly dependent upon the target antigen that is chosen as some viral structures can be highly conserved across broad families of virus and others can be highly derived and specific to a given strain. Therefore, it is important to understand the cross reactivity to other viruses of the test being used so as to avoid misinterpretation of a false positive result that may be detecting an antigen from a similar virus, yet not confer immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These tests fall into two broad categories: laboratory-based immunoassays which require a reader or analyzer to detect the reaction, and cassette-based systems which can be read at the point of care through a change in color in an indicator region visible to the naked eye.",

Cassette systems use the principle of lateral flow immunoassay or immunochromatography. The cassette contains a shallow well into which approximately 10 to 15ul (e.g. two small drops from a finger prick) of whole blood, serum or plasma are placed along with a small quantity of buffer specific to the test kit. The blood and buffer are absorbed into a porous test strip which is impregnated with recombinant viral antigens doped with an indicator (e.g. colloidal gold, latex particles, europium, or quantum dots). Antibodies from the serum bind to antigens in the test strip and are wicked laterally along the length of the test strip. In the indicator regions of the test kit, anti-human antibodies which are immobilized in the test strip will bind to the antigen-antibody complex and hold them in the indicator region. The colloidal gold, or other colorant, accumulates in the indicator region leading to a visible change in color along a narrow band of the wicking substrate. There may be one or more indicator regions with anti-human antibodies that are specific to IgM, IgG or other immunoglobulins. All tests should also contain a \u201cControl\u201d indicator line to confirm that the test sample has appropriately wicked along the length of the assay and antigens in the test kit remain viable, therefore confirming a valid test procedure (Figure 1\n).

Results themselves should always be interpreted in accordance with the package insert and instructions for use with the specific test kit being utilized, but the following discussion is helpful in linking the binary results of the typical antibody test to clinical meaning and making informed recommendations for patients and the workforce. As discussed earlier, IgM antibodies are produced in the short term after infection while IgG are produced in a more delayed timescale. The use of both is advantageous [18] [19] [20]. In a recent study, of 535 plasma samples taken from 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2, the median seroconversion time for total antibody (Ab), IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) 15 days after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p<0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006) consistent with the understanding that more symptomatic patients are likely to have higher antibody responses, and higher inflammatory markers, on average. Using the SARS coronavirus as an example, IgM antibodies generally rise above the detectable threshold for these point of care tests in approximately 5 to 7 days after the initial onset of symptoms (assuming a patient does develop symptoms after infection. The IgM then remains above the detection threshold for 14 to 21 days from symptom onset. About midway through the rise and fall of IgM production, around day 14 post-symptom onset, IgG will rise above detection levels. IgG production will generally continue to rise for 28 to 35 post symptom onset, peaking around or after clinical recovery. IgG typically has a long half-life and will remain above detectable thresholds for months or even years after the resolution of infection.",

This is primarily because 1) there is a temporal lag between exposure to the virus and the development of antibodies by the immune system and 2) antibodies will persist long after the body has cleared an infection. These tests are an excellent tool to be used in parallel with molecular testing, patient history and clinical presentation in symptomatic patients or used in asymptomatic patients over a period of time to understand return to activity recommendations. The temporal framework related to exposure, onset of symptoms, production of IgM and IgG, symptom resolution and virus shedding throughout the course of disease have not been well quantified for SARS-CoV-2 specifically. At this time, most of the data and recommendations have been extrapolated from the studies done on the first SARS outbreak in the early 21st century. It is also important to understand, that molecular testing is imperfect as well, with up to 30% false negative rates in some series. Therefore, when looking at the sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing, one must be academic enough to recognize the inherent weaknesses of using such a test to evaluate another test. It will be hard to know whether a positive antibody test in a patient with a negative molecular test means the former test is a false positive or the latter was a false negative. Physicians must truly diligence these products and be satisfied with the data, as well as the track record of the company marketing it. We expect a lot more information to be forthcoming in the peer-reviewed literature over the next 6 to 18 months which will improve the interpretation and utility of antibody tests.",

Other coronaviruses in circulation in the human species also lead to at least partial immunity for some period of time. The immunity question has implications for whether COVID-19 follows an annual cycle like seasonal influenza or becomes dormant for multiple years and then erupts again, according to a recent publication in the journal Science. The authors noted that two other coronaviruses in circulation (OC43 and HKU1), which cause common colds, result in about 45 weeks of immunity on average. If the new virus follows that pattern, it would probably create annual outbreaks, they found [21]. However, generally speaking, the sicker you become due to an infection and the robust immune system response to it, the more robust the immunity provided. Therefore, one might assume that those people who get the most ill have the longest and most effective immunity after a re-exposure to the same virus. In a study by Callow et al. [22] people volunteered to have coronavirus 229E, which also causes common cold symptoms, inoculated up their nares. Ten became infected, and eight developed cold symptoms. One year later, all but one of them returned to be re-infected again. The majority were re-infected, but those who had been ill before did not develop cold symptoms. Moreover, the period during which the patients shed the virus, and were potentially contagious, was shorter. The new virus, SARS-CoV-2, is genetically similar to the first SARS virus \u2014 hence the \u201c2\u201d \u2014 but it affects people differently. It is not as lethal as the original SARS but is more easily spread (RO is higher) [23]. Many people who are infected do not develop symptoms at all and yet can potentially transmit the virus to others.",

Most strikingly, younger people had fewer antibodies in the wake of the disease \u2014 and 30 percent of those sampled had low levels. Some individuals had no trace of antibodies. That has raised the question of whether a person with a mild or asymptomatic infection, but confirmed by the sensitive PCR test, might still be susceptible to a second infection. The neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated with plasma CRP levels but negatively correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between degree of humoral response and cellular immune response. However, those with mild disease who do not develop high levels of antibodies may be at increased risk of re-infection, but are not likely to get significant symptoms, although the may be contagious. Therefore, those without antibody production should likely be treated as if they never had the disease from a social distancing perspective, even if they were proven to be positive with molecular testing.",

We must accept that data, especially early data, is rarely complete or perfect and we must utilize the existing body of knowledge to make evidence-based decisions. We believe that there exists a real value in antibody testing when performed properly with quality devices and a good understanding of how to interpret the clinical meaning of the results. Such testing can help educate decisions regarding social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment and can help risk stratify essential work force members.
