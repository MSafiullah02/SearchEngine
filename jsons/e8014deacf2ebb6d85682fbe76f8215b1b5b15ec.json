Modeling cDC development is both crucial to study cDCs and harness their 26 potential in immunotherapy. Here we addressed whether cDCs could differentiate in response 27 to trophic cues delivered by mesenchymal components of the hematopoietic niche where they 28 physiologically develop and maintain. We found that expression of the membrane bound 29 form of human FLT3L and SCF together with CXCL12 in a bone marrow mesenchymal 30 stromal cell line is sufficient to induce the contact-dependent specification of both type 1 and 31 type 2 cDCs from CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Engraftment of 32 these engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (eMSCs) together with CD34 + HSPCs creates an 33 in vivo synthetic niche in the dermis of immunodeficient mice. Cell-to-cell contact between 34 HSPCs and stromal cells within these organoids drive the local specification of cDCs and 35 CD123 + AXL + CD327 + pre/AS-DCs. cDCs generated in vivo display higher levels of 36 resemblance with human blood cDCs unattained by in vitro generated subsets. Altogether, 37 eMSCs provide a novel and unique platform recapitulating the full spectrum of cDC subsets 38 enabling their functional characterization in vivo. 39 40 41",

Dendritic cells can induce immune 45 tolerance 2 or drive the development of immunity 3 . 46 The analysis of blood circulating subsets has revealed that cDCs consist in two major 47 subtypes: CD141 + XCR1 + Clec9A + DCs (cDC1) and CD1c + CD11c + CD172a (SIRPa) + DCs 48 (cDC2s) 4-6 . Both cDC1s and cDC2s arise from a bone marrow committed progenitor 7 or 49 from early IRF8 + multipotent progenitors 8, 9 , which generate a common circulating precursor 50 10 that progressively diverge in pre-cDC1s and pre-cDC2s 10-12 . Type 1 DCs are conserved 51 between mouse and human, and they share the expression of specific surface markers such as 52 Clec9A 13 and XCR1 5 as well as the transcription factor (TF) IRF8, which is essential for the 53 development of murine cDC1s 4-6, 13-15 . Conversely, human CD1c + type 2 DCs have been 54 shown to express the IRF4 TF 16 , which controls the development of their phenotypic 55 equivalent in the mouse model 16, 17 . This rather simple picture is complicated by the diversity 56 of CD1c + cells, which encompass migratory DCs as well as CD14 int inflammatory DCs 57 recruited during inflammation [18] [19] [20] . More recently, un-biased approaches have uncovered a 58 deeper complexity in the DC network with the identification of 2 types of cDC2s with 59 distinct transcriptional profiles and the identification of AXL + CD11c + CD1c + cells which 60 have been proposed to act as a precursor for cDCs 12, 21 . other niche factors 28 . At steady state, Flt3-ligand (FLT3L) is delivered as a membrane-bound 67 precursor expressed on radio-resistant stromal cells [29] [30] [31] . After egressing from the bone 68 marrow, DC precursors circulate in the blood and seed the peripheral tissues 32 . In the lymph 69 node, stromal fibroblastic reticular cells provide FLT3L 33 , and FLT3-dependent proliferation 70 of cDC in periphery is required for their maintenance 34, 35 . 71 Modelling the development of cDCs in culture systems is instrumental to better understand 72 their ontogeny and define their immunological function. Pioneer work from Banchereau et al. 73 have identified that GMCSF and TNF-a cooperate to produce CD1a + cells with features of Here we aimed at modeling human cDC development by providing physiological factors 92 associated to hematopoietic niches. We found that engineered mesenchymal stromal cells 93 (eMSCs) expressing a combination of membrane-bound FLT3L and SCF/KITL together with 94 CXCL12 provide a scaffold for human cDC differentiation. Engraftment of eMSCs along 95 with CD34 + HSPCs leads to the local development of cDCs in immunodeficient mice. This in 96 vivo system recapitulates the differentiation of pre/AS-DCs, cDC1s and cDC2s with an 97 unreached level of similarity with the phenotype of human blood cDCs. ",

Conversely, several aspects have limited an 411 exhaustive validation of in vitro generated CD1c + cDC2-like cells such as the expression of 412 CD14 7 , the transcriptional alignment with monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) 39 or the lack of 413 a high-dimensional phenotypic characterization 48, 49 . 414 Here we described a new system (MS5_FS12), which efficiently supports the differentiation 415 of both CD141 + Clec9A + cDC1s and CD14 -CD1c + cDC2s. However, cDC2s generated in 416 MS5_FS12 cultures only partially recapitulate the phenotype of circulating blood cDC2s, as 417 suggested by the lack of expression of cDC2-specific markers such as FceRIa and CD5.418 Nevertheless, engineered MSCs display the unique advantage of being suitable for in vivo 419 applications. 420 Immunodeficient mice provide a unique system to model the onset of human immune 421 responses in realistic settings 71 . However, a reliable method to achieve the differentiation of 422 human DCs in vivo has not been described, yet. Current protocols rely on the engraftment of 423 human CD34 + HSPCs in sub-lethally irradiated immunodeficient mice (humanized mice). 424 This strategy has not been successful in the generation of well-characterized circulating DC 425 subsets 71 . Administration of supraphysiological levels of recombinant FLT3L has been 426 shown to stimulate cDC differentiation upon reconstitution of NSG 29, 50 or Flt3 -/-BRGS 51 427 mice with human CD34 + HSPCs. However, the phenotype of CD141 + cDC1s and CD1c + 428 cDC2s was poorly characterized and, despite exceptions 52 , tissue DCs were not generally 429 investigated. These aspects represent an important limitation by precluding, for instance, the 430 20 modeling of skin vaccination. Alternatively, transgenic mice expressing human GM-CSF and 431 IL-3 (in the presence or absence of human SCF), either constitutively 72, 73 or by replacing 432 their murine counterparts (knock-in) 74 , have been generated. Despite displaying higher levels 433 of myeloid reconstitution, as well as the presence of human alveolar macrophages in the 434 lungs of humanized mice 74 , this approach did not improve the development of human cDCs 435 in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues of engrafted animals. 436 We demonstrated that MS5_FS12 support the differentiation of human cDCs in vivo in 437 subcutaneous organoids in NSG mice. High-dimensional mass cytometry (Cytof) and 438 transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analysis of in vivo generated cells confirmed their phenotypic and 439 transcriptional alignment to circulating blood cDC1s and cDC2s. More importantly, cDC2s 440 generated in vivo better resemble their physiologically circulating counterparts by expressing 441 higher levels of FceRIa, CD172a, CD5, CD2 and BTLA when compared to in vitro 442 differentiated cells. The lower expression of activation markers such as CD86, CD80 and 443 MHC molecules also suggests that in vivo cDC2s displayed a less mature phenotype than in 444 vitro generated cells. 445 Moreover, MS5_FS12 niche was capable of supporting the local maintenance and expansion 446 of human HSPCs as well as pre/AS-DCs, resulting in the persistence of a long-lasting source 447 of progenitors capable of undergoing DC differentiation. To our knowledge, this is the first 448 time that a well-characterized system supporting the development of human pre/AS-DC is 449 reported. 450 Collectively, we have demonstrated that the engineered stromal cells MS5_FS12 give rise to 451 a synthetic hematopoietic niche when injected subcutaneously in NSG mice. The niche 452 microenvironment efficiently supports the expansion of CD34 + HSPCs, and human DCs 453 subsets (cDC1, cDC2 and pre/AS-DC) can be detected as early as day 12 in a radiation-free 454 environment. Importantly, in vitro culture system imposes a certain level of spontaneous 455 21 activation that is not found in primary circulating blood DCs. Differentiation of human cDCs 456 within humanized mice limit this phenomenon and make cDCs more similar to circulating 457 primary cDCs. Hence, this approach represents a versatile system to study human DC 458 development and function in vivo. in vivo experiments were performed using NOD.Cg-Prdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice 462 (JAX #005557). All mice were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. They were maintained 463 in specific-pathogen-free conditions and handled according to protocols approved by the UK 464 Home Office. 465 Generation of engineered MSCs 466 Human FLT3L, SCF and TPO were amplified by PCR from cDNA expression plasmids 467 (Origene) and cloned into pMX retroviral vectors (vectors details in Supplementary Table 1). 468 Lentiviral vector pBABE-puro-SDF-1 alpha was a gift from Bob Weinberg (Addgene 469 plasmid #12270) 75 . Viral particles were generated using the retroviral packaging plasmid 470 pCL-Ampho and a second generation lentiviral packaging system (psPAX2 and pMD2.G), 471 respectively. MS5 cells were first transduced with CXCL12 lentiviral vector and selected 472 using 15 \u00b5g/ml of Puromycin (Thermo Fisher). Then, a combination of single or multiple 473 cytokines were used to transduce MS5 cells as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2a. Cells 474 expressing human membrane bound FLT3L and SCF were sorted according to antibody 475 staining of the transmembrane proteins (antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 2). TPO-476 expressing cells were sorted according to the expression of mCherry reporter. 477 Flow cytometry and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) 478 Extracellular staining of cells was preformed in FACS buffer, consisting in PBS (Life 479 Technologies), 1% BSA (Apollo Scientific) and 2 mM EDTA (Life Technologies). For 480 intracellular staining, samples were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm TM 481 kit (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturers' instructions.
