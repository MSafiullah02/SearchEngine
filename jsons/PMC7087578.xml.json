Perhaps analysts and policy-makers have not cared about efficiency because public health expenditures comprise less than 3% of all health care costs [16]. However, many experts believe that public health will take on an increasing role in the future given the threat of bioterrorism attacks, concerns over emerging diseases such as avian flu and SARS, and the seemingly growing burden from natural disasters such as Katrina [37].2 If so, a better understanding of the factors affecting the relative efficiency of local health departments may prove useful to public health policy-makers.",

The DEA indicates that the typical LHD operates with about 28% inefficiency although inefficiency ranges as high as 69% for some LHDs. Multiple regression analysis is then used to explore if various factors can explain these observed differences in inefficiency across the different LHDs. Among the findings, the regression results imply that more centralized and urban LHDs are less efficient at producing local public health services. In addition, the results suggest that efficiency is higher for LHDs that produce a greater variety of services internally and rely more on internal funding.",

For this approach, deviations from the efficient frontier are considered as resulting from inefficiency or random factors. The other approach, DEA, developed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes [8], is based on mathematical programming and creates a piecewise-linear best practice frontier based on the observed data. DEA requires only a minimum number of regularity conditions to be satisfied with respect to the technology and does not require us to make arbitrary assumptions about the functional form of the production frontier. For this method, all deviations from the frontier are treated as inefficiency such that the DEA scores capture the relative efficiency of the decision making units (DMUs). We adopt DEA rather than SFA for estimating the technical efficiency of the local health departments since the functional form of the production frontier for LHDs and the distributional properties of the inefficiency and error terms are not known.",

Further, DEA has been used for measuring the efficiency of government-operated health centers in other countries. For instance, Kirigia et al. [19] uses DEA to measure the technical efficiency of public health clinics in Kenya. Moreover, in New Zealand, the government has used DEA in practice since 1997 to identify efficient expenditure levels to set prices for hospital services at the diagnostic related group level [28].",

Clearly, points B, C, and D and E lie on the isoquant and represent efficient LHDs, whereas the points A, F, and G represent inefficient LHDs. Suppose that we are interested in evaluating the technical efficiency of the LHD represented by point A. In this case, it is possible to proportionately contract the input bundle to I and still produce the given amount of output. Hence comparison of the input bundle at A with the input bundle at I provides a measure of the input oriented technical efficiency for LHD A (i.e., 0I/0A). This is the Farrell input based technical efficiency measure [12]. As we can see, the measured efficiency will be <1 for the LHDs represented by A, F, and G, whereas it will be equal to 1 for the LHDs represented by B, C, D, and E.\n\n",

While standard production theory normally relates inputs to outputs, Santerre [30] recently argues that population and variety of services serve as reasonable proxies for the scale and breadth of output given that public health services are not directly observable and measurable. For example, a greater population likely means more restaurant inspections by public health officials. Also, population is not an unreasonable proxy for output because, as mentioned in the introduction, public health refers to the actions taken for the health of the community as a whole.",

[35] provide a detailed discussion of this issue. Zero outputs generally do not pose a problem in standard efficiency models because the output constraint corresponding to the zero output will always be feasible irrespective of the model orientation [35, p309].9 However, zero inputs introduce bias in DEA analysis because at least one unit with a zero input will always be VRS or CRS efficient regardless of the levels of its remaining inputs or outputs [35, p310]. In other words, when a DMU has a zero value of an input k, all peers of that DMU being assessed should also have a zero value on that input k. Thus, at least one DMU with zero value on input k will be a peer to the DMU being assessed and so will be Pareto-efficient irrespective of what values such a peer has on outputs or inputs other than k (even if they are using inefficiently large amounts of other inputs). This implies a restricted reference set for the units with zero inputs, since DMUs with zero values of an input will only be compared among themselves [35, p312]. Further, from a conceptual standpoint, health departments that can produce the given outputs with zero values of some inputs operate differently than those that require at least some amounts of those inputs to produce the same outputs. Hence, in a sense, these two groups do not face the same options of transforming inputs into outputs and so may face different technologies. [34, 35].",

First, greater funding from higher levels of government could result in a moral hazard problem such that the LHD faces less pressure to produce as efficiently as possible because of the financial cushion provided from outside sources. Second, greater external funding may simply reflect that public health problems are more severe in those particular LHDs. More severe problems require additional inputs. For both of these reasons, we would expect an inverse relationship between the percentage of external funding, which is specified in the estimation equation, and the degree of internal efficiency.",

The degree of centralization may influence the efficiency at which public health services are delivered although the exact theoretical relationship is unclear. On the one hand, the Tiebout theory [36] argues that decentralization promotes efficiency. People shop for local public goods like public health by voting with their feet and this Tiebout-type competition forces public decision-makers to operate more efficiently. On the other hand, centralization could favor coordination and thereby enhance the efficiency of public health delivery. Finally, state dummy variables are specified in the estimation equation to control for any state policies that might create efficiency differences across the various LHDs in the sample.",

Two methodological issues were addressed: First, as the DEA produced efficiency scores are truncated (scores range from 0 to 1 regardless of the actual variations among those who receive 0 and 1) and are serially correlated to one another (all scores are estimated relative to the leading performers on the efficiency frontier), a bootstrap simulation on the raw DEA scores was performed using Frontier Efficiency Analysis with R (FEAR, version 1.12) software [32, 33]. The bootstrap procedure produced bias-corrected efficiency scores between, but excluding 0 and 1. After simulation, the number of facilities with high efficiency scores was reduced. Second, as the regression residuals have a truncated distribution because the dependent variable (the DEA efficiency scores) are naturally bounded between 0 and 1, a truncated regression with random effects was performed. This model produces robust regression coefficients and standard errors of the independent variables [15]. For comparative purposes, ordinary least square results are also reported. Table 2 provides the multiple regression findings. The estimated coefficients and their associated t-statistics are shown opposite from each explanatory variable.\n\n",

The calculated elasticity suggests that a 10% increase in the fraction provided by external agencies is associated with nearly a 1% decline in internal efficiency.",

However, a calculated elasticity of 0.02 means that little economic significance should be attached to the influence of intergovernmental funding on efficiency. Third, racial but not ethnic composition appears to affect the efficiency at which public health services are delivered.

Finally, the empirical results indicate that LHDs in micropolitan and rural areas are 0.07 and 0.13 percentage points more efficient than LHDs in urban areas at producing local public health services.

The degree of inefficiency faced by LHDs seems to be particularly high especially when compared to hospitals for which measured efficiency averages around 85% [17].

If the data ever become available it would be desirable to revisit this analysis with a panel data set. The panel data would help control for unobservable heterogeneity to some degree and also introduce a dynamic component into the analysis. Two, the analysis would be strengthened with expenditure data broken down by each type of service provided internally and externally. Third, data for other types of capital and non-labor inputs, more demographic and environmental data, and some measures of the quality of public health services for each LHD would add to the analysis. Indeed, measures of structural, process, and outcome quality are particularly important for the DEA given that less resources devoted to an activity, while potentially reflecting increased efficiency, may also reflect reduced levels of process quality or less \u201cquality time\u201d devoted to a particular activity.17\n",
