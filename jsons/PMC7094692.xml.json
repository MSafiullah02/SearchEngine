            "text": "Over the past decade there has been increasing interest in the pathogenesis and management of COPD as it has been recognized that the disease is having a major worldwide impact.6 In the United States, estimates from national interviews taken by the National Center for Health Statistics,7 have shown that > 16 million people are afflicted with COPD; about 14 million are thought to have chronic bronchitis, while 2 million have emphysema.7 It has been suggested that these statistics underestimate the prevalence of COPD by as much as 50%, as many patients underreport their symptoms and their conditions remain undiagnosed. On the other hand, the accuracy of a self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and a physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic bronchitis have been questioned.8 Using a longitudinal population study, patients were surveyed for self-reported chronic bronchitis or physician-diagnosed chronic bronchitis. The survey asked about symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production and the timing of these symptoms. Seventeen percent of current smokers, 12.4% of former smokers, and 6% of never-smokers met the criteria for chronic bronchitis. The vast majority of people (88.4%) who reported a self-reported or physician-confirmed diagnoses of chronic bronchitis did not meet the standard criteria. The overdiagnosis of chronic bronchitis by patients and physicians may be very common. Because the term bronchitis is often used as a common descriptor for a nonspecific and self-limited cough, many patients assume that they have had chronic bronchitis. In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, using surveys, physical examinations, and pulmonary function testing, more accurate prevalence estimates have been made. Using World Health Organization definitions, it has been shown that 23.6 million adults (13.9% of the adult population) have COPD.9, 10 Chronic bronchitis is among the most frequent causes of cough found in community surveys.11\n",

Cigarette smoke is composed of a complex mixture of > 400 particles and gases; the specific etiologic role of each of these constituents has not been established. Many studies10, 12, 13, 14 have confirmed the association of cigarette smoking, chronic cough, and low lung function. The incidence of chronic bronchitis is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. Other risk factors for chronic mucus hypersecretion that have been identified are increasing age, male gender, childhood respiratory infections, frequent lower respiratory tract infections, occupational exposures, and asthma. Pipe and cigar smoking are also risk factors for both complications even in the absence of former cigarette smoking.10 The prevalence of chronic cough in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was reported15 in subjects without airflow obstruction and in those with undiagnosed airway obstruction. Cough was found in 9.3% of subjects and sputum production was found in 8.3% of subjects without airflow obstruction. The study also confirmed the observation that these symptoms are more common in subjects with more severe airflow obstruction. In those subjects with mild airflow obstruction, cough was found in 16.0% of those surveyed and sputum production in 17%. With severe airflow obstruction, using the GOLD staging criteria, the prevalence of cough increased to 49% of patients, and sputum production was found in 39.5% of patients.",

The diagnosis is usually made by finding a history of exposure in individuals who have no other identifiable cause of cough. This is often difficult because many workers are smokers or are exposed to second-hand smoke. Other workers, such as those exposed to organic dusts, may present with chronic cough and a history of asthma-like symptoms without airway eosinophilia, reversible airflow obstruction, or bronchial hyperresponsiveness.17 This occurs with chronic exposure to cotton (byssinosis), jute, hemp, flax, sisal, wood, and various grains. There is a growing body of literature that has demonstrated that specific occupational exposures are associated with the symptoms of chronic bronchitis and, at times, airflow obstruction,18, 19, 20, 21 which are comparable to moderate cigarette smoking.22 The list of agents includes the following: coal; manufactured vitreous fibers; oil mist; cement; silica; silicates; osmium; vanadium; welding fumes; organic dusts; engine exhausts; fire smoke; and second-hand cigarette smoke.23\n",

BAL studies in such subjects have shown an increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages; both play an important role in perpetuating the inflammatory process of chronic bronchitis. Bronchial biopsy specimens from former smokers show inflammatory changes that are similar to those in the active smoker, suggesting that inflammation may persist in the airway once established. A number of extracellular signaling proteins called cytokines are important in the pathogenesis of COPD because they are thought to mediate the tissue damage and repair that are induced by cigarette smoking. Increased quantities of certain proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 have been found in the sputum of smokers with chronic bronchitis, and even further increased quantities of these cytokines have been found during acute exacerbations.",

The mucus is eliminated by the action of mucociliary clearance to the hypopharynx, where it is swallowed and rarely noticed. Normally, about 500 mL of sputum is produced each day, and it is usually not noticed. Smokers with chronic bronchitis produce larger amounts of sputum each day, as much as 100 mL/d more than normal. This results in cough and sputum production. The excess mucus occurs as a result of an increase in the size and number of the submucosal glands and an increase in the number of goblet cells on the surface epithelium. Mucous gland enlargement and hyperplasia of the goblet cells are, therefore, the pathologic hallmark of chronic bronchitis. Goblet cells are normally absent in the small airways, and their presence there (often referred to as mucous metaplasia) is important to the development of COPD. In the larger airways in patients with chronic bronchitis, there is a reduction in the serous acini of the submucosal glands. This depresses local defenses to bacterial adherence, because these glands are known to produce microbial deterrents such as lactoferrin, antiproteases, and lysozyme. Other epithelial alterations that are seen in patients with chronic bronchitis are a decrease in the number and length of the cilia, and squamous metaplasia. The mucociliary abnormalities of chronic bronchitis cause the formation of a continuous sheet or blanket of mucus lining the airways instead of the discreet deposits of mucus seen in normal airways. The pooling of secretions also may occur. This provides an additional cause of bacterial growth, which in turn causes a release of toxins that are further damaging to the cilia and epithelial cells. Bacterial exoproducts are known to stimulate mucus production and slow ciliary beating, to impair immune effector cell function, and to destroy local Igs. This cycle is especially seen in current smokers, as opposed to former smokers.",

Airway inflammation and excessive bronchial secretions are likely to activate the afferent limb of the cough reflex.31 There is evidence that the cough receptors are heightened in patients with chronic bronchitis as it has been demonstrated that capsaicin induced cough is increased.32 When airflow obstruction is present, it often leads to an ineffective cough as a result of decreased expiratory flow,33 and this coupled with impaired mucociliary clearance results in the further retention of secretions and a vicious cycle of chronic recurrent coughing.34, 35 Even in the absence of airflow obstruction and with a short smoking history, impaired mucociliary clearance has been shown in young smokers. This occurs because of abnormal clearance in the small airways. Patients with advanced disease and evidence of airway obstruction have mucus retention in the small peripheral airways and larger central airways.36, 37 This cycle is further worsened during episodes of acute viral and bacterial infections, which are common in patients with chronic bronchitis.38\n",

            "text": "Patients with chronic bronchitis have a greater frequency of acute respiratory infections than those without bronchitis, and with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory infection they are more likely to have signs of infection in the lower airways than are healthy control subjects.39 During these attacks or exacerbations, cough and sputum production increase and the sputum may become purulent. The exacerbations may also cause worsening shortness of breath; therefore, clinicians should be aware that other conditions such as heart failure and pulmonary embolism could mimic an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. While there is no uniformly accepted definition of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, most have acknowledged that this condition is due to a sudden deterioration in the condition of a stable patient with symptoms of increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath due to acute tracheobronchitis. An exacerbation is often preceded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. An important element of this definition is that causes of respiratory deterioration other than acute tracheobronchitis, such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of bronchiectasis, pneumothorax, and congestive heart failure, are excluded. Evidence of a viral infection is found in approximately one third of episodes. Common viral infections in the outpatient setting are rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza B, and parainfluenza.40, 41 Viral respiratory infections predispose the airways to bacterial superinfection because they interfere with mucociliary clearance, impair bacterial killing by pulmonary macrophages, and increase the risk of aspirating secretions containing bacteria from the upper airways. Whether bacterial overgrowth or infection alone, in the absence of acute viral infection, is the cause of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis has been controversial. During stable periods, many patients with chronic bronchitis, and especially current smokers, are colonized with bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, and these same organisms have been found in patients during an acute exacerbation. However, the molecular typing of sputum isolates has shown that acute exacerbations of COPD are frequently associated with a new strain of a preexisting organism. This supports a causative role for bacteria in the acute exacerbations of COPD.42 Although most such episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are self-limited, they are associated with substantial decrements in the quality of life43 and impose a considerable financial burden on the health-care system.43\n",

With respect to chronic cough, several nonrandomized trials have studied the effect of smoking cessation on this troubling symptom. Cough has been shown56 to disappear or markedly decrease in 94 to 100% of patients after smoking cessation, and in approximately half of the subjects this occurred within 1 month. The Lung Health Study57 investigated the effects of smoking cessation in smokers with mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction. It was a 5-year randomized prospective trial57 of intensive smoking intervention compared to a control group of smokers who received usual care. At the end of 5 years, 22% of those in the intervention group had stopped smoking for the entire study period. The beneficial effects, including a reduction of chronic cough and sputum production, occurred in the first year of smoking cessation. It was sustained throughout the entire study period. Ninety percent of those patients who had chronic cough at the beginning of the study and stopped smoking reported no cough by the end of the study. Similar findings were reported regarding sputum production. However, in patients with more severe degrees of airflow obstruction chronic cough is more likely to persist despite the avoidance of cigarettes or other respiratory irritants.",

With this agent, patients coughed fewer times, and their cough was less severe. In addition, the volume of sputum expectorated decreased significantly.69 On the other hand, trials70 of a once-daily regimen of inhaled anticholinergic tiotropium in patients with COPD showed significant bronchodilatation and relief of dyspnea when compared to placebo, but no effect on cough using diaries to assess daily symptom scores. The use of oral theophylline for the treatment of COPD has declined over the last several decades because of concerns over side effects, especially in elderly patients, and issues regarding interactions with other drugs. Therapy with oral theophylline does improve cough in stable patients with chronic bronchitis.71 During an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is good evidence that bronchodilator therapy improves outcomes55; however, the effect on cough has not been systematically studied.",

Level of evidence, fair; benefit, intermediate; grade of evidence, B\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n1.\nAdults who have a history of chronic cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months and for at least 2 consecutive years should be given a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis when other respiratory or cardiac causes of chronic productive cough are ruled out. Level of evidence, low; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, B2.\nThe evaluation of patients with chronic cough should include a complete history regarding exposures to respiratory irritants including cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoke; passive smoke exposures; and hazardous environments in the home and workplace. All are predisposing factors of chronic bronchitis. Level of evidence, low; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, B3.\nSmoke-free workplace and public place laws should be enacted in all communities. Level of evidence, expert opinion; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E/A4.\nStable patients with chronic bronchitis who have a sudden deterioration of symptoms with increased cough, sputum production, sputum purulence, and/or shortness of breath, which are often preceded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, should be considered to have an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out or are considered unlikely. Level of evidence, expert opinion; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E/A5.\nIn patients with chronic cough who have chronic exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards, avoidance should always be recommended. It is the most effective means to improve or eliminate the cough of chronic bronchitis. Ninety percent of patients will have resolution of their cough after smoking cessation. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A6.\nIn stable patients with chronic bronchitis, there is no role for long-term prophylactic therapy with antibiotics. Level of evidence, low; benefit, none; grade of recommendation, I7.\nIn patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the use of antibiotics is recommended; patients with severe exacerbations and those with more severe airflow obstruction at baseline are the most likely to benefit. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A8.\nIn stable patients with chronic bronchitis, the clinical benefits of postural drainage and chest percussion have not been proven, and they are not recommended. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, conflicting; grade of recommendation, I9.\nIn patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, the clinical benefits of postural drainage and chest percussion have not been proven, and they are not recommended. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, conflicting; grade of recommendation, I10a.\nIn stable patients with chronic bronchitis, therapy with short-acting \u03b2-agonists should be used to control bronchospasm and relieve dyspnea; in some patients, it may also reduce chronic cough. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A10b.\nIn stable patients with chronic bronchitis, therapy with ipratropium bromide should be offered to improve cough. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A10c.\nIn stable patients with chronic bronchitis, treatment with theophylline should be considered to control chronic cough; careful monitoring for complications is necessary. Level of evidence, fair; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A11.\nFor patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, therapy with short-acting \u03b2-agonists or anticholinergic bronchodilators should be administered during the acute exacerbation. If the patient does not show a prompt response, the other agent should be added after the first is administered at the maximal dose. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A12.\nFor patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, theophylline should not be used for treatment. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, none; grade of recommendation, D13.\nFor stable patients with chronic bronchitis, there is no evidence that the currently available expectorants are effective and therefore they should not be used. Level of evidence, low; net benefit, none; grade of recommendation, I14.\nIn stable patients with chronic bronchitis, treatment with a long-acting \u03b2-agonist when coupled with an inhaled corticosteroid should be offered to control chronic cough. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A15.\nFor stable patients with chronic bronchitis and an FEV\n1\nof < 50% predicted or for those patients with frequent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, inhaled corticosteroid therapy should be offered. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A16.\nFor stable patients with chronic bronchitis, long-term maintenance therapy with oral corticosteroids such as prednisone should not be used; there is no evidence that it improves cough and sputum production, and the risks of serious side effects are high. Level of evidence, expert opinion; net benefit, negative; grade of recommendation, E/D17.\nFor patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is no evidence that the currently available expectorants are effective, and therefore they should not be used. Level of evidence, low; net benefit, none; grade of recommendation, I18.\nFor patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, a short course (10 to 15 days) of systemic corticosteroid therapy should be given; IV therapy in hospitalized patients and oral therapy for ambulatory patients have both proven to be effective. Level of evidence, good; net benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, A19.\nIn patients with chronic bronchitis, central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing. Level of evidence, fair; benefit, intermediate; grade of evidence, B\n\n",
