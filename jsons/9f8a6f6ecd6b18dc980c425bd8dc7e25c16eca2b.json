            "text": "Continuous-time Markov process models of contagions are widely studied, not least because of their utility in predicting the evolution of real-world contagions and in formulating control measures. It is often the case, however, that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we show how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for large values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio between the former and the latter is small.",

Allen, in her work [33] , shows that discrete-time susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models can produce complex behavior such as period doubling and chaotic effects for sufficiently large values of the time step and/or contact rate. This behavior is not possible in the continuous-time SIS and SIR models, and is thus no more than an artifact of discretizing time. Similarly, Gomez et al. [39] observe that differences between continuous and discrete-time SIS dynamics are substantial when an arbitrary time step of t = 1 is employed. An understanding of the discrepancies introduced as a result of discretizing time is thus important, allowing us to gauge the validity of discrete-time approaches and when they may accurately be employed.",

Our message is clear-that the accuracy of such methods will be poor if state transition probabilities are too large, leading to deviations from the underlying continuoustime process. The repercussions of this are manifold. Discretetime theoretical approaches can be significantly inaccurate for large values of the contagion parameter values (such as infection and recovery rates), and thus the analysis of such approaches will not be valid. Furthermore, discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations-often used as a gold standard [34, 49, 50] can be inaccurate for large parameter values, and such inaccurate simulations can lead to misleading conclusions. We illustrate this latter point with an example from the literature in Sec. IV. Our work highlights the consequences of erroneous approaches to studying continuous-time contagion dynamics, which has important implications not only for the academic study of these dynamics [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] but also for the implementation of such dynamics within large-scale simulators for real contagions [31, 32] .",

Here r y\u2192y is the instantaneous rate at which the network changes from state y to y and is fully determined by the network structure and the transition rates \u03bc and \u03b2. While the master equation is the gold standard-exactly describing the evolution of SIS dynamicsthe dimension of its sample space is 2 N , which in general is prohibitively large for analytical or numerical studies. One way to tackle this problem is to study the dynamics as a series of individual transitions between states. In continuous-time dynamics nodes change state one at a time, or asynchronously [54] . Given the state of the network, the probability distributions governing both the length of time until the next state change and the node which will change state can be constructed. These are given by the following lemmas (of which rigorous derivations can be found in the literature, e.g., Ref. [23] , chapter 10): Lemma 1. Let \u03c4 be the holding time of the network, the length of time that the network remains in its current state before changing to the next state. Then \u03c4 is an exponentially distributed random variable and the parameter of the distribution is the sum of the individual node transition rates, i.e., N i=1 r i . Lemma 2. The probability that the next node in the network to change state will be node i is r i / N j =1 r j . Lemmas 1 and 2 describe how the network probabilistically evolves from one state to another. They are the basis of continuous-time stochastic simulation methods such as the well-known Gillespie algorithm, also known as the stochastic simulation algorithm or kinetic Monte Carlo [55] [56] [57] [58] . Such simulations are often referred to as event-based simulations because the time intervals are not fixed but rather correspond to the time between consecutive state-changes in the system. At each step in such algorithms, time advances by an amount \u03c4 and node i changes its state, where \u03c4 and i are random numbers drawn according to Lemmas 1 and 2 ( Fig. 1) . Stochastic simulations give the opportunity to construct p(y,t) empirically by running multiple realizations of the stochastic process and aggregating over an ensemble of realizations. Such simulations are statistically exact as they are fully based on Lemmas 1 and 2, which are derived without approximation from the axioms of the Markov process.",

In a time interval of length t in the continuous-time Markov process, the exact probability that an infected node will recover is 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03bc t while the probability that a susceptible node will become infected by a given infected neighbor is 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b2 t .

When\u03bb < 0.1, < 0.01 and so the approximation is fairly accurate in this range.

We begin in the next section by examining the discrete-time approximations of Eqs. (5) and (6) for fixed \u03bc and \u03b2 and various values of t. We show that discrete-time dynamics can accurately reproduce continuous-time dynamics for small values of t, but that they incur a breakdown in accuracy as t increases. Further to this, we show in Sec. IV that when the time step is fixed to the value t = 1, as in much of the literature, discrete-time approaches break down in accuracy when the transition rates (\u03bc and \u03b2) are too large. This limits the range of parameters that can be studied with discrete-time approaches. We illustrate this with an example from the literature, also showing how synchronous updating simulation schemes can favour discrete-time formalisms leading to biased conclusions when comparing against continuous-time theories. Finally, in Sec. V we show that overly large values of\u03b2 and\u03bc can affect the value of the epidemic threshold, even if the effective transition rate defined as \u03b3 = \u03b2/\u03bc =\u03b2/\u03bc is small.",

From this histogram, it is clear that while the discrete-time simulations are quite accurate for small t this accuracy can fully break down when t is too large. The accuracy of the probability distribution in the metastable state depends highly on the value of the time step used to reach the metastable state. In the synchronous updating simulations with t = 1 the results are highly inaccurate with all of the probability concentrated on n = 9, i.e., p(n,3) = \u03b4 n, 9 .

We performed a short comparison of the simulation algorithms in terms of speed, showing in Table I the simulation run times for the 10 6 realizations for the Gillespie algorithm and for synchronous updating with various values of t. For t = 0.01-corresponding to the simulations which most closely match the accuracy of the Gillespie simulations-the Gillespie algorithm is an order of magnitude faster.

The bases of the comparison are synchronous updating numerical simulations with a time step t = 1 and it is found (see for example Fig. 4 of Ref. [36] ) that the NLDS theory is much closer to the numerical simulations than both the HMF and KW theories. However, the comparison of discrete-time and continuoustime formulations in this manner is biased. Synchronous updating with a time step t = 1 is the correct procedure for numerically simulating discrete-time dynamics.

The example is SIS dynamics on an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network of 1000 nodes and mean degree k = 4. Figure 4 shows various numerical simulations of these dynamics. Again, the computer code used to perform the simulations is available from Ref. [60] . Included in Fig. 4 are synchronous updating simulations with a time step t = 1, as in Ref. [36] , along with synchronous updating simulations with a small time step t = 0.01 and Gillespie algorithm simulations. In Fig. 4 (c) of Ref. [36] , where \u03bc = 0.72 and \u03b2 = 0.2, it can be seen that the fraction\u03b7 of infected nodes in the metastable state given by the NLDS theory matches very closely the synchronous updating numerical simulations. However, as can be seen in Fig. 4(b) here, these synchronous updating simulations differ quite significantly from continuous-time simulations, which plateau at the metastable state with\u03b7 \u2248 0.04. The KW theory, which in Ref. [36] is rejected as being inaccurate, actually converges to a value much closer to the continuous-time simulations than the NLDS theory.

Recall that the effective transition rate is defined as the ratio of the infection rate to the recovery rate, i.e., \u03b3 = \u03b2/\u03bc. Depending on the structure of the network and whether the network is finite or infinite, the critical point, or epidemic threshold, \u03b3 c between different phases can vary. As mentioned in Sec. IV, there are still remaining questions about the steady-state behavior of the SIS model-particularly the value of the epidemic threshold on such networks-and so a good understanding of how different approximations affect the value of the epidemic threshold is important. In this section, we show that although the epidemic threshold is defined in terms of the ratio \u03b3 = \u03b2/\u03bc =\u03b2/\u03bc, the individual values of the transition probabilities\u03b2 and\u03bc used in discrete-time approaches affect the value of the epidemic threshold when it is calculated by (i) performing discrete-time numerical simulations or (ii) iterating a discrete-time system [such as Eq.

For a given network, we fix the value of\u03bc and vary\u03b2 so that the effective transition rate \u03b3 varies between \u03b3 min and \u03b3 max where \u03b3 min and \u03b3 max are chosen so that the epidemic threshold lies between them, i.e., \u03b3 min \u03b3 c \u03b3 max . Thus when\u03bc is small (large),\u03b2 will be small (large) so that their ratio lies in the range \u03b3 min \u03b2 /\u03bc \u03b3 max . We perform standard synchronous updating simulations (with t = 1) and obtain the critical value \u03b3 c as the smallest value of \u03b3 such that the fraction of nodes in the metastable state is nonzero. If the epidemic threshold depends only on the ratio \u03b3 =\u03b2/\u03bc and is independent of the individual values of \u03bc and\u03b2, then \u03b3 c should be the same regardless of the value of \u03bc, which is fixed. However, we find that this is not the case.",

IV (Fig. 5) but with a greater number of nodes. On such a network, the epidemic threshold is predicted by steady-state analysis of both the NDLS and HMF theories as \u03b3 c = 0.25. From Fig. 5 we see that when\u03bc is small (\u03bc = 0.1), the epidemic threshold predicted by synchronous updating simulations corresponds to this value \u03b3 c = 0.25. However, as\u03bc (and thus\u03b2) increases, the accuracy of the discrete-time approach breaks down and both the fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state and the epidemic threshold deviate from the true values. The epidemic threshold decreases from \u03b3 c = 0.25 when\u03bc = 0.1 to \u03b3 c = 0.2 when\u03bc = 1, even though the ratio \u03b3 =\u03b2/\u03bc remains in the same range. Thus, in discrete-time formalisms the steady-state behavior is not fully determined by the effective transition rate \u03b3 but also depends on\u03bc and\u03b2. From our analysis in Sec. III (Fig. 3) it is clear that the metastable state reached iteratively from an initial condition depends on the single-step transition probabilities\u03bc and\u03b2. If these are too large, the errors introduced in the discrete-time approximation become significant, affecting the metastable state and the value of the epidemic threshold.",
