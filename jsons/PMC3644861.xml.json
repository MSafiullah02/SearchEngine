Until the etiologic agent was identified and serology deployed, the epidemiology of HIV infection was unclear. The long latency from infection to symptoms and high disease risk in infected persons only became clear once serology was possible. Responding to the initial uncertainty surrounding HIV required a new paradigm of precaution that was foreign to the blood community who preferred to wait for more certain information before intervening aggressively and uniformly.2Starting in March 1985, three HIV tests were (quickly) licensed. The ability to respond to future threats and move tests through the approval process may also take a long time, emphasizing the importance of having all stakeholders including manufacturers, the blood community, and the FDA involved as soon as possible.\n",

The response to NANBH was prolonged, in part, because the scientific community was focused on HIV.2The majority of discussions regarding NANBH and surrogate testing focused not on the need to protect patients but on the potential impact of donor deferral on blood availability. The AIDS epidemic caused a massive shift in focus to blood safety.3In the current era of molecular virology, many viruses will be identified without associated diseases. A baseline estimate of viral sequences in humans has not yet been established, but the human microbiome is under active investigation. Two NIH grants are specifically addressing plasma viral discovery programs.4Viruses such as HCV and HIV remain significant public health problems in the developing world, in the face of the constraints against implementation of the resource\u2010intensive solutions used in the developed world.5At the NIH blood bank, evaluation of ALT testing after it was implemented indicated that it did not appear to be effective in reducing NANBH cases, and a cost\u2013benefit analysis was unable to define a precise financial estimate for the benefits of ALT testing. Surrogate testing for other agents remains controversial although strict interpretations of the precautionary principle would encourage use of such a testing approach.\n",

Success was possible in part because there was rapid consensus about the need to intervene and little controversy about the appropriate technology (NAT) required for doing so. In contrast, the response to NANBH was delayed in part because of concerns that nonspecific interventions might do more harm than good.2Public\u2013private partnerships were critical to the successful responses to WNV emergence.3The most appropriate deployment of WNV NAT to prevent the maximum number of cases has not yet been determined, but the paucity of transfusion transmissions in recent years validates the iterative approach to triggering ID testing that evolved over several transmission seasons.4Expanding ID testing during the peak transmission interval in the summer has been discussed. The tiny number of transfusion\u2010transmitted infections during recent seasons (one in 3 years through 2011) suggests that the value may be minimal. Barriers include a large increase in reagent and consumables consumption and staffing in high\u2010throughput NAT laboratories.\n",

Thus there were additional uncertainties about which viruses might have been associated with CFS.3Because of the possible negative effects of promulgating requirements too early, the FDA is willing to work cooperatively with the private sector on alternative actions until there is more certainty. For example, if the FDA feels industry is responding appropriately to a potential threat to the blood supply, it can withhold its own action.4A robust process is needed to decide which stakeholders should participate in decision making and to verify who has implemented recommendations.5There is a risk that information can be interpreted differently by different members of the task force. In addition, in cases of uncertainty, responses to potential threats can differ by group or jurisdiction. Although the AABB Task Force promoted agreement among members on decisions and statements, such agreement might not be necessary. A uniform process for the evaluation of evolving information should be in place, with standard criteria and values to be addressed by all groups as they make their decisions. Having such a process can allow groups to better explain the differences in their responses.\n",

Likewise, experiences with HIV and HCV have led many to assume that the next threat will spread by parenteral contact and be associated with risk behaviors. Recent agents, such as WNV and dengue, are vector borne, cause transient infections, and would cause a substantial number of transfusion\u2010transmitted cases only if infection was highly prevalent. Moreover, the risk of infection with these agents depends more on where someone lives or travels. Potential transfusion\u2010transmissible agents that require further investigation might be discovered through repository studies or viral discovery programs without being associated with any known disease; from agents associated with clinical disease, but not proven to be transfusion transmitted at the time they are discovered; or from zoonotic agents, such as the virus underlying SARS, that are spread to humans.",

Likewise, there has been no evidence that recent measles outbreaks are transmitted by transfusion, but there has been enough concern for a working group to issue a fact sheet. Although arboviruses such as WNV can cause human disease and be transmitted by transfusion, the risk for such transmission will depend on their outbreak potential, and because they have complicated epidemiologies such potential cannot be predicted. Retroviruses are of particular concern because of their potential for latent infection and mutagenicity. In addition, transfusion bypasses the body's natural defenses and therefore can be a highly efficient route of transmission. Thus, even low concentrations of pathogen can be transmitted based on the volume of blood transfused. Moreover, many recipients are often immunosuppressed and can therefore develop severe clinical disease if infected.",

In other cases, transfusion transmission might be theoretically possible, but the likelihood very low. Infrastructure and detailed planning processes can address these scenarios, and potential approaches might differ by scenario.

An action plan can include triggers and decision points to guide theoretical actions, but these triggers could simply provide impetus for further consideration. For example, with the H1N1 influenza epidemic, decision trees were established, and stakeholders reconvened and considered potential actions each time a threshold or trigger was approached. Action plans should be flexible, because each infectious agent is different, and one response does not fit all situations. Moreover, in many cases, such as that with XMRV, critical elements of a checklist, such as the epidemiology of an agent or its association with disease, might not be known to guide next steps.",
