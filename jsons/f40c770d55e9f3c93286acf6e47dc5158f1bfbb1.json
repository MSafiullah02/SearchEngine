Today, however, the risk of multiple injuries and deaths from a given incident has increased dramatically [1] [2] [3] [4] . Not only is the earth more heavily-populated with human life settled across many more regions of the planet, but there are also larger pockets of human inhabitants. Most of these population centers are concentrated in high-risk locales such as metropolitan cities where very frequent and multiple person-to-person contacts occur. In addition, the world now faces a broadened spectrum of disasters, ranging from unconventional wars, nuclear releases, transportational mishaps, terrorist bombings, infectious disease epidemics and chemical discharges to fl oods, famine, earthquakes, tornadoes, cyclones and fi res [2, 4] .",

Accordingly, the numbers of casualties resulting from each incident are more likely to be large [2] . The recent undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean that sent towering, 700 kilometer per hour tsunamis across Southern Asia resulted in a tremendous number of deaths and morbidity because of the sheer volume of exposures.

For example, the economic down-turns in the United States, Europe and elsewhere after the events of fall 2001 are often considered one of the casualties of the terrorist attacks. It emphasizes the under-recognized widespread affects that disasters can have on the international public psyche. Even when loss of life and infrastructure are relatively minimal in the grand scheme of the particular nation involved, disasters can have signifi cant and far-reaching psychological impact (e.g., the 2001 U.S. anthrax postal system attacks).

This would occur not only through forewarned prevention of injury and illness, but also through rapid access to sustenance, medical and rescue assets. It could be emphasized that much of the loss of life and morbidity from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis and their subsequent sequelae actually resulted from relative limitations in terms of such characteristics. Nevertheless, the events of the fall of 2001 in the United States and the subsequent Toronto experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) also exposed the vulnerability of even relatively healthy and well-resourced nations.",

Facilitated by obsessive mass media mania, the potential threat of other public health crises (involving large populations) as a result of either terrorism or natural disease (e.g., small pox and avian fl u pandemic scenarios) became more of a reality in terms of public perception. As a result, tremendous political pressure has developed for medical clinicians and public health offi cers alike to become better prepared to protect the public from all disasters, let alone doomsday scenarios. This response has played out in political venues such as the development of the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. and improved worldwide intelligence-gathering cooperation both domestically and internationally. Nevertheless, while some improvements in surveillance and pharmacological resource allocations have evolved, the medical aspects of homeland security and public health emergency preparedness remain worrisome and under-developed relative to public expectations of the safety net, be they appropriate expectations or not.",

Many of the key trauma centers and EMS crews are deluged on a day-to-day basis, brimming with fully-occupied beds, sub-optimal nurse and ancillary personnel staffi ng, despite increasing demands for service and a higher acuity of illness and injury. One could argue that these existing health care services, including ambulances, emergency centers, operating rooms, and intensive care units (ICUs) are facing a disaster each day as available medical resources outstrip the daily demands for urgent and critical care.

However, the medical care infrastructure, even in wealthy countries already seems to operate at capacity, making a major multiple injury event or an infl uenza pandemic a true challenge. One might, therefore, ask what our ICUs would need to be like in the year 2015 and, in this case, our ICUs would not only be those located in the traditional in-patient facilities, but also ambulances, emergency centers and even fi eld hospitals.

Less than a hundred were admitted to ICUs or monitoring beds. Most of these patients had chest pain or respiratory distress, presumably resulting from particulate matter and smoke.

Moreover, even if licensed, hospital accreditation, in most venues, requires prospective scrutiny of physicians with relevant background checks and certain administrative requirements. All of these procedures take time and are therefore essentially impossible to provide at the time of a catastrophic event. While some communities have set up mechanisms to cross-credential physicians, only a few have done so and this does not account for the issues of familiarity and skills utilization. Moreover, the key practitioners that might be needed to provide assistance at alternative locations in a disaster are skilled nurses, respiratory therapists, dialysis technicians, pharmacists and the like. While all of these practitioners could also be 'cross-credentialed', it still does not account for motivators to have any of those persons participate. Motivators are not just the dedication of an avid volunteer or the lure of a fi nancial incentive, but they also include care for those practitioners' families in the midst of a disaster during which time the families may be vulnerable as well (no food or water, loss of electricity, trapped by fl ooding, possible exposure to contagious disease, etc).

It relies on the premise that one should prepare for such events by modifying day-to-day activities to accommodate requirements for a multi-casualty event.

Ironically, with increased demands for protection from terrorism and other public health threats, fi nancial resources have been diverted from healthcare to national defense and homeland security efforts. Unfortunately, most security efforts are overhead costs and not at all revenue-generating. Even within hospitals, dealing with disaster management is generally administrative in nature (training, equipment, procedures, personnel) and consumes and diverts medical care professionals' time and efforts from their day-to-day patient care activities.",

All hospitals, particularly those in recognized earthquake zones, should have 'earthquake-proof' designs with applicable structural integrity. When a hospital is a potential terrorist target such as any main receiving facility, trauma center, burn center, or chil-dren's hospital, security measures will dictate the need for barricades to bombs and specialized ventilation systems that detect and can control the spread of aerosolized poisons or biologicals. These hospitals will have a disproportionate number of negative pressure rooms and well-established decontamination zones around the potential entrance and receiving personnel (e.g., trained triage nurses and security personnel will be staged further out into the periphery and prepared with universal precautions and easy access to decontamination suits, including high level personal protective equipment (PPE).",

However, one might then return to entertaining the concept of a specialized facility to manage pandemics and disseminated bioterrorism incidents such as a mutated smallpox organism. In this case, to overcome the concepts of lack of familiarity with equipment and resources, credentialing, liability and medical skills utilization, a mitigating solution would be to dedicate a reserve team of medical personnel in the way a government entity deploys a fi re service or army as a dedicated standing force. Currently, a hybrid for this type of concept is accomplished through the mobile medical teams and tent hospitals designed by the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), an element of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States Department of Homeland Security. Although it does not employ a round-the-clock standing team, it does utilize a 'stand-by' team of medical and allied health volunteers who are trained and routinely exercised to operate mobile hospitals. Currently, these teams would likely be inadequate for a mass casualty scenario with tens of thousands of victims, but still they are somewhat helpful in areas where the standing facilities have been destroyed, impaired or rendered inaccessible.",

Inter-hospital agreements to facilitate transfers of patients to balance out surges throughout the system will be in play in the best prepared communities. Such agreements will also include specialized storage facilities for antidotes and antibiotics, perhaps in a separate, undisclosed and protected storage facility, but close enough for easy access. The regional hospitals will purchase these items in bulk to leverage economies of scale (cheaper prices), but they will also coordinate receipt so that expiration dates on the drugs will be staggered and not all expiring at once. Such coordination would also include the use of healthcare and ancillary personnel in case of over-load at a given hospital or incapacity of another. Not only will prospective cross-credentialing be accomplished ahead of time using familiar mechanisms, but the process may even be facilitated by course completion in Advanced Disaster Life Support (ADLS) and Hospital Disaster Life Support (HDLS) types of courses [1, 2] . In all likelihood, arrangements will fi rst focus intra-murally. For example, they may prioritize the use of nurses from the same hospital system (i.e., many hospital systems operate more than one hospital) because of the similarities in policies, procedures, liability coverage and payroll considerations. Such coordination of efforts would be a massive under-taking, but well-prepared communities will cooperate in such approaches.",
