SARS-CoV-like viruses have been isolated from caged Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs in live-animal markets in China (Guan et al., 2003, Kan et al., 2005). Evidences for direct transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses from these animals to humans have been reported (Song et al., 2005, The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). However, recent studies suggested that civets may have served only as an amplification host for SARS-CoV and the existence of an upstream wild animal reservoir has been proposed (Tu et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2005). Consistent with this hypothesis, SARS-CoV like viruses sharing more than 88% nucleotide identities with SARS-CoV have been isolated from horseshoe bats in mainland China (Li et al., 2005) and Hong Kong SAR (Lau et al., 2005). Thus, re-emergence of SARS-CoV is a matter of concern and an efficient vaccine would be the most effective way to control a new epidemic.",

            "text": "Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus. Its large single-stranded genome, 29.7 kb in length, encodes the replicase polyproteins, small accessory proteins and four major structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the small envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), and a large, club-shaped spike protein (S). The SARS-CoV spike protein is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of 1255 amino acids (a.a.), with a molecular weight of \u223c 180 kDa. As predicted by sequence analysis, it consists of four domains: a signal sequence (a.a. 1 to 14), a large ectodomain comprised of amino-acids 15 to 1190 with 23 potential N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain (a.a. 1191 to 1227), and a short cytoplasmic tail of 28 a.a. (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The S protein mediates many of the biological properties of the virus, including viral entry: binding to cellular receptors, ACE2 (Li et al., 2003) and L-SIGN (Jeffers et al., 2004), penetration and fusion between the viral and cellular membranes (Matsuyama et al., 2005, Petit et al., 2005, Simmons et al., 2005). It is also associated with host range and tissue tropism (Giroglou et al., 2004, Qu et al., 2005), as for other coronaviruses (Casais et al., 2003, Haijema et al., 2003, Kuo et al., 2000).",

Moreover, passive immunization studies demonstrated that spike-specific neutralizing antibodies are protective in the mouse (Subbarao et al., 2004) and ferret (ter Meulen et al., 2004) animal models. Accordingly, several candidate vaccines relying on the induction of spike-specific neutralizing antibodies have been reported to induce a protective immune response in various animal models (Bisht et al., 2004, Bisht et al., 2005, Buchholz et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2004).",

The most studied of these latter viral elements are the CTE of Mason-Pfizer Monkey virus (MPMV-CTE) (Rizvi et al., 1996) and the PRE of Woodchuck Hepatitis virus (WPRE) (Donello et al., 1998) and both have been successfully used for that purpose (Loeb et al., 1999, Tan et al., 1995, Wodrich et al., 2000, Zufferey et al., 1999). However, the optimal choice of posttranscriptional enhancer modules depends on the type of cDNA to be expressed (Schambach et al., 2000). Whether this strategy may apply to the expression of genes from cytoplasm-replicating RNA viruses, which mRNAs are not naturally processed by splicing and nuclear-export machineries, remains to be determined.",

The inserted intron is composed of the donor site from the first intron of the human \u03b2-globin gene and the branch and acceptor site from the intron of an immunoglobulin gene (Promega, January 2004, revision date). These results suggested that the presence of an intron is required for expression of the SARS-CoV S gene, when the corresponding mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus of transfected cells. However, expression levels driven by pCI-S remained low as compared to the levels observed in the T7 RNA polymerase based expression system (Fig. 1, compare lanes 4 and 6).

Thus, target cells were prepared by co-transfection of 293T cells with pcDNA-DsRed and pcDNA3-ACE2, which allow expression of the fluorescent DsRed protein and the ACE2 SARS-CoV receptor, respectively (Li et al., 2003). Concurrently, effector cells were prepared by transfection of 293T-GFP cells with the pCI-S-WPRE plasmid. The fusion of co-cultured green effector cells and red target cells was evaluated by FACS analysis (Fig. 5\n). We found that no cell-to-cell fusion occurred when S-expressing effector cells were mixed with mock-transfected target cells (panel B) or when mock-transfected effector cells were mixed with ACE2-expressing target cells (panel C), as the percentage of green- and red-stained cells did not increase above background (panel A). In contrast, more than 45% of target cells expressing ACE2 did fuse with effector cells expressing S (panel D).",

Female BALB/c mice were immunized by intramuscular injection of 2, 10 or 50 \u03bcg of pCI-S, pCI-S-CTE or pCI-S-WPRE naked plasmid DNA. This dose range extended from suboptimal to optimal doses of typical plasmid DNA vaccine in mice and was selected according to our preliminary experiments (data not shown) and published data (Fu et al., 1999, Ulmer et al., 1994, Wang et al., 2000). As control, a group of mice was injected with 50 \u03bcg of DNA from the parental pCI plasmid. Mice were boosted at week 4 with the same dose of DNA and the resulting immune responses were analyzed 3 weeks later. Anti-S serum IgG antibody titers were determined for each individual mice by indirect ELISA using SARS-CoV-infected VeroE6 cell lysates as native antigens (Fig. 7\n). At the optimal 50-\u03bcg dose, each of the three S expression plasmids induced a high anti-S IgG response. The log10 serum IgG titers were 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 for both pCI-S and pCI-S-CTE-immunized mice and 3.9 \u00b1 0.1 for pCI-S-WPRE-immunized mice, indicating that pCI-S-WPRE induced significantly higher (\u223c 2-fold, p\n < 0.05) anti-S IgG levels than pCI-S and pCI-S-CTE. At the 10-\u03bcg suboptimal dose of plasmid DNA, pCI-S-WPRE induced a much higher and more consistent response across mice (3.6 \u00b1 0.2 log10 titer) than pCI-S (2.8 \u00b1 0.4 log10 titer, p\n < 0.01) and pCI-S-CTE (2.4 \u00b1 1.0 log10 titer, p\n < 0.03). At the lowest dose (2 \u03bcg plasmid DNA per mouse), both pCI-S and pCI-S-CTE failed to induce any detectable anti-S antibodies (log10 titer < 0.9) with the exception of a single mouse (1.4 log10 titer) out of eight pCI-S-CTE-immunized mice, whereas anti-S IgG titers remained high (3.1 \u00b1 0.5 log10 titer) for all pCI-S-WPRE-immunized mice. Thus, the anti-S antibody levels induced by pCI-S-CTE were comparable to those induced by the pCI-S construct, with no statistically significant differences at any dose tested (p\n > 0.3).",

First, sera were sampled at 3 weeks post-immunization, and we examined whether the antibody response was capable of SARS-CoV neutralization. Neutralizing antibody titers remained below the detection level after injection of either pCI-S or pCI-S-CTE plasmid DNA (Fig. 8A). In contrast, significant levels of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were measured in 7 out of 8 mice immunized with pCI-S-WPRE plasmid DNA. Next, at 8 weeks post-immunization, mice were transferred to a BSL-4 animal facility and challenged by intranasal inoculation of 105 pfu of SARS-CoV. Viral loads in the lungs were evaluated 2 days later (Fig. 8B). No significant difference was found in the viral titers observed in mice injected with pCI-S (5.8 \u00b1 0.5 log10 pfu/lungs), pCI-S-CTE (5.9 \u00b1 0.3 log10 pfu/lungs) or with control pCI (5.3 \u00b1 0.6 log10 pfu/lungs). In sharp contrast, immunization with pCI-S-WPRE plasmid DNA conferred almost complete protection with no infectious virus detectable in 7 out of 8 mice (log10 pfu/lungs < 1.8) and a very low residual titer in a single mouse (p\n < 10\u2212 8).",

            "text": "To our knowledge, the vast majority of published studies relying on the transient expression of the spike protein of all coronaviruses before the SARS-CoV epidemic was recognized, involved the use of either T7 RNA polymerase-based expression systems or viral expression vectors such as recombinant Sindbis or vaccinia viruses (Horsburgh and Brown, 1995, Krueger et al., 2001, Narayanan et al., 2003, Pulford and Britton, 1991, Vennema et al., 1996, Yoo and Deregt, 2001). This may be indicative of the difficulty to express efficiently the long coronavirus S gene following transient transfection of mammalian cells with conventional DNA expression vectors, that lead to mRNA synthesis in the cell nucleus. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also found that the SARS-CoV S gene is not expressed at detectable levels when cloned into the classical pcDNA mammalian expression vector under the control of a nuclear polymerase II promoter (Fig. 1), whereas it is expressed efficiently from a recombinant vaccinia virus (V. Lorin, B. Callendret, S. van der Werf and N. Escriou, unpublished data). Likewise, it has been reported that the S protein from SARS-CoV is poorly expressed following DNA transfection (Chang et al., 2006, Hofmann et al., 2004, Qin et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004), hence most published studies used T7 RNA polymerase-based expression systems (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003) or synthetic genes optimized for human codon usage (Huang et al., 2004, Qin et al., 2004, Zhi et al., 2005). Here, we describe the design and use of a modified DNA expression vector to enhance SARS-CoV S expression in mammalian cells. This DNA vector contains the CMV immediate/early promoter, a chimeric intron and a cis-acting CTE or WPRE element. We demonstrate that this vector permits the expression of high levels of S at the cell surface of transiently transfected cells, that are compatible with functional and antigenic characterization of the S protein. In addition, this low-cost and easy-to-use expression vector allowed us to develop a cell-to-cell fusion assay and an immunofluorescence assay, which may prove useful for the study of cellular and viral determinants of S-induced membrane fusion and for the sensitive and specific routine diagnosis of SARS seroconversion.",

            "text": "Detectable expression of both spike mRNA and protein in transfected cells required the use of plasmid vectors containing an intron upstream of the S ORF (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Our findings are consistent with data reported by Hofmann et al. (2004), Simmons et al. (2004) and Broer et al. (2006), who employed the pCAGG or phCMV vectors to achieve detectable S expression. Both pCAGG and phCMV vectors also harbor donor and acceptor splice sites downstream of a polymerase II promoter. Altogether, these data indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of S mRNA, hence S protein expression, are absolutely dependent on splicing. Most genes in higher eucaryotes contain at least one intron and many studies have clearly shown that constitutively spliced introns or the presence of a heterologous intron of either viral or cellular origin may be required for optimal gene expression in a variety of systems, including transient expression in mammalian tissue culture cells. The importance of splicing for expression of a given gene appears to depend on several factors such as intron and exon identity and cell type (Buchman and Berg, 1988, Petitclerc et al., 1995). Albeit much less documented, the expression of intronless genes of bacterial and viral origin can also be enhanced by including introns within mammalian vectors (Huang and Gorman, 1990, Huang and Yen, 1995). Although it has been suggested that introns alter the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of mRNAs, more recent data indicate that splicing rather enhances both mRNA production and translational efficiency (Lu and Cullen, 2003, Nott et al., 2003). Our results extend these observations and indicate that the nuclear expression of naturally intronless genes derived from RNA viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm may follow the same requirements (presence of an intron) for efficient mRNA accumulation in the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Although cis-acting viral export elements could compensate for the lack of an intron in the expression of the human \u03b2-globin cDNA from a retroviral vector (Schambach et al., 2000), CTE and WPRE did not permit efficient expression of the SARS-CoV S gene from the pcDNA vector and both S mRNA and protein remained undetectable. However, a remarkable boost in S expression was observed when CTE or WPRE was combined with an intron within the pCI vector (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Interestingly, we did not observe any effect of CTE at the level of S mRNA production in 293T and VeroE6 cells. This was unexpected because CTE-enhanced expression has been linked to CTE-mediated export of mRNAs, conferring rev-independence to HIV-1 gag expression (Bray et al., 1994, Wodrich et al., 2000) and contributing to overcome inhibitory elements of HPV-16 L1 mRNA (Tan et al., 1995). Our results rather support the hypothesis raised by Schambach et al. (2000), according to which CTE is much more efficient in promoting export of unspliced intron-containing retroviral RNA transcripts (Ernst et al., 1997a, Gruter et al., 1998, Kang and Cullen, 1999), than in facilitating the transport of spliced mRNA. In contrast, WPRE enhanced cytoplasmic S mRNA levels by 3-fold in both 293T and VeroE6 cells. Both CTE and WPRE have an export function, but they differ by the mechanisms involved in that CTE binds to the Tap nuclear mRNA export factor (Gruter et al., 1998), while WPRE recruits the cellular Crm1 RNA export factor (Popa et al., 2002). The observation that Tap is also implicated in the export of cellular spliced mRNAs from the nucleus suggests that CTE RNA and spliced mRNAs share a common nuclear export pathway (Braun et al., 1999). This may explain the absence of synergy between intron and CTE in enhancing the cytoplasmic levels of spliced S mRNA in both 293T and VeroE6 cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, WPRE RNA and spliced mRNAs use different factors for nuclear export and our data indicate that these may act synergistically to enhance the cytoplasmic expression of an intron-containing WPRE RNA (Fig. 4). A similar observation was made by Schambach et al., who reported that elevated expression of the human multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) mRNA in SW480 cells depends on the presence of both an intron and WPRE (Schambach et al., 2000).",

Such a role for CTE in mRNA translation has been recently suggested by the groups of Boris-Lawrie and Hammarskj\u00f6ld (Coyle et al., 2003, Hull and Boris-Lawrie, 2003, Jin et al., 2003). In contrast, it is not in full agreement with the common view that WPRE exerts its effect on protein expression mainly by enhancing 3\u2032 mRNA processing and nucleocytoplasmic transport (Donello et al., 1998, Loeb et al., 1999, Zufferey et al., 1999). To our knowledge, a single report suggested that WPRE may contribute to enhanced cytoplasmic utilization of an intronless EGFP mRNA in addition to its effect on nuclear RNA processing and RNA export (Schambach et al., 2000). Interestingly, the closely related Hepatitis B virus PRE has also been reported to enhance translation of the RNA harboring this element (Lu and Cullen, 2003).",

Codon-usage adaptation most often involves the substitution of nearly every wobble position for a G or C nucleotide (Nakamura, October 2006, posting date, Nakamura et al., 2000), resulting in genes with a much diverse nucleotide composition and decreased A/T content. Wild-type genes from viruses with a nuclear life cycle such as HIV-1 or HPV-16 contain regulatory elements evolved to inhibit mRNA cytoplasmic accumulation. For HIV-1 Gag, Vpu, Vif (Graf et al., 2000, Kotsopoulou et al., 2000, Nguyen et al., 2004) or HPV-16 L1 and L2 proteins (Collier et al., 2002, Oberg et al., 2003), codon optimization of corresponding genes has been shown to result in the inactivation of such elements, thus leading to increased viral protein expression from nuclear DNA expression vectors. Cytoplasmic viruses, such as SARS-CoV, may contain cryptic splice sites, mRNA instability motifs such as A/U-rich elements (AREs), or putative cis-active inhibitory sequences, which may explain why DNA vector-based expression of genes from these viruses is dependent on the presence of heterologous intron and transport elements. It can be hypothesized that codon-usage adaptation is a successful strategy to express high levels of cytoplasmic virus proteins as the result of removal of these yet uncharacterized inhibitory elements.",

This is in agreement with the absence of S polypeptide expression in cultured cells from the pcDNA-S plasmid (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3) and with the weak antibody responses observed by others in mice immunized with pcDNA-based S constructs (Wang et al., 2005b). In addition, among published reports describing full-length-S-based DNA vaccines, only those based on a codon-optimized gene proved capable of inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice (Yang et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2005, Yi et al., 2005) or rabbits (Wang et al., 2005a). It is noteworthy that similar observations were reported recently for replication-defective human adenoviral vectors containing the wild-type S gene under the control of the CMV promoter; such recombinant vectors failed to induce cellular immune responses against spike epitopes, whereas vectors encoding codon-optimized S protein proved to be potent immunogens (Zhi et al., 2005). Since expression from adenoviral vectors relies on nuclear transcription of the foreign gene, this corroborates our hypothesis that wild-type S mRNA does not accumulate in the cytoplasm in the absence of a heterologous intron.",

(2004). Moreover, our in vivo data clearly indicate that immunization with the WPRE-enhanced vaccine induced complete protective immunity against challenge infection with SARS-CoV at doses as low as 2 \u03bcg at which the more conventional DNA vaccine (including intron sequence but lacking WPRE) did not (Fig. 8). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful DNA vaccination protocol using the full-length, wild-type S gene of SARS-CoV, without codon optimization. Whether WPRE could further enhance the protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine based on a codon-optimized gene of the SARS-CoV S protein, such as that reported by Yang et al., is an interesting question which would deserve additional studies.",

The three studies with the SARS (our study), influenza (Garg et al., 2004) and neuroblastoma (Pertl et al., 2003) models show remarkable complementarity in demonstrating that WPRE enhanced the protective efficacy of DNA vaccines encoding antigens from the fully-spliced cDNA of a tumor gene and two naturally intronless genes, one derived from a nucleus-replicating negative strand RNA virus (influenza virus) and the other from a cytoplasm-replicating positive strand RNA virus (SARS-CoV). The mechanisms involved in the enhanced induction of protective immunity remain stricto sensu to be investigated but WPRE very likely improves the level of antigen expression in vivo, as it does in vitro in transient transfection experiments.",

From a practical point of view, this may help decrease the amount of plasmid DNA in immunization protocols. As noted by others (Garg et al., 2004), by lowering the amount of DNA used in immunization protocols, concerns raised by the use of DNA vaccines, such as risks posed by integration events into the host genome or the induction of autoimmune responses (Cui, 2005), are minimized. Moreover, one of the principal limitations to DNA vaccine efficacy in large animals, like non-human primates, may be related to the limited distribution of DNA within the injected tissue and limited uptake to the nucleus following injection of DNA vaccine in a relatively small volume (Dupuis et al., 2000, Otten et al., 2004). These limitations may be circumvented by the use of efficient DNA vectors based on a combination of intron and WPRE enhancer, such as those we describe here. Thus, these improved plasmid vectors might possibly contribute to the development of a safe and efficient DNA vaccine against SARS in humans. Further studies in larger animals, such as cynomolgus macaques or African Green Monkeys, which were recently described as suitable animal models for SARS (Fouchier et al., 2003, Lawler et al., 2006, McAuliffe et al., 2004, Rowe et al., 2004) could help validate the intron and WPRE based vectors.",

Briefly, after reverse transcription of the RNA, overlapping S cDNA fragments were produced by nested PCR and the cDNA fragment representing the complete S gene sequence (nt 21406\u201325348) was assembled from clones harboring the consensus protein sequence as deduced by direct sequencing of the amplicons from specimen #031589 (Nal et al., 2005). The resulting plasmid pSARS-S was used as the source of S cDNA for subsequent cloning into mammalian expression vectors. Comparison of its sequence with the S sequences of the TOR2 (GenBank accession no. AY274119.3) and Urbani (GenBank accession no. AY278741.1) isolates revealed one amino-acid difference at position 577: Alanine for TOR2 and Serine for Urbani and 031589. The DNA sequence coding for the S protein was amplified by PCR with the PWO polymerase (Roche) using pSARS-S plasmid as a template and oligonucleotides 5\u2032-ATAGGATCCA CCATGTTTAT TTTCTTATTA TTTCTTACTC TCACT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATACTCGAGT TATGTGTAAT GTAATTTGAC ACCCTTG-3\u2032 containing BamHI and XhoI restrictions sites. After digestion with BamHI and XhoI, the resulting DNA fragment was inserted at the corresponding sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen), yielding plasmid pcDNA-S. Next, the S insert was subcloned between the NheI and XhoI sites of the pCI plasmid (Promega), yielding plasmid pCI-S.",

Statistical analysis was performed on the log10 of the viral titers measured for individual mice using the Student's independent t-test, with the assumptions used for small samples (normal distribution of the variables and same variance for the populations to be compared).",
