            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is the causative agent of the atypical pneumonia, was first identified in the fall of 2002 to be a previously unknown member of the family of coronaviruses[1]. The rapid transmission by means of aerosols and the high mortality rate (up to 10%) make SARS a potential global threat. An attractive approach to interfere with SARS disease progression focuses on one of the earliest infection processes by blocking the fusion process that mediates the delivery of the viral genome into the host cell. The spike protein (S protein) is a 180- to 200-kDa type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that is responsible for the initiation and propagation of infection by interacting with a cellular receptor to induce cell-to-cell fusion. Binding of the S protein to a specific soluble or cell surface glycoprotein receptor induces global changes in the conformation of S protein that displays a previously hidden hydrophobic surface area which allows the virions to interact with the host cell membrane2, 3. Earlier attempted expressions of this S protein failed to obtain soluble full-length polypeptides in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Subsequent work aimed at identifying smaller but folded SARS-CoV spike fragments for use as possible antigen or vaccine candidates. The approach involved digestion and reassembly of the target gene to generate a pool with smaller DNA fragments of random ends but controllable lengths which were screened for foldable fragments using a green fluorescent protein as a folding reporter4, 5. Two foldable fragments were identified, which coincide with various SARS peptides reported to have SARS neutralization activity6, 7, 8. This dissection approach has the potential to be a generally applicable tool for producing foldable fragments of viral surface proteins that may provide discontinuous epitopes. These fragments should be easier to express in E. coli or other recombinant hosts.",

Compared with linear short peptides derived from the protein, folded fragments may be advantageous as they have the potential to provide discontinuous epitopes. The SARS-CoV spike gene was digested by DNase I to generate a pool of short DNA segments, followed by an additional step of reassembly of these segments to produce a library of DNA fragments with random ends10, 11. This is in part analogous to the DNA shuffling protocol12, 13, but the purpose here is not to produce full-length hybrids from a group of different parental genes, but to generate various smaller DNA fragments from a single template gene. The reassembly step following the DNase I treatment is necessary to prepare a large number of DNA sequences with controlled lengths, which was achieved by tailoring the number of PCR cycles used in the reassembly (see Methods). To screen for discrete folded polypeptide fragments, the reassembled gene fragments were further cloned into a vector as N-terminal fusions to a folding reporter gene which was a variant of the green fluorescent protein that exhibits strong fluorescence upon UV excitation[9]. GFP has been shown to be an effective indicator for the foldability of the upstream polypeptide partner4, 5. The vector construction is shown in Fig. 1\n.",

In addition, some others (a total of 20) contained vectors with inserts in the reverse orientation or not in frame as indicated by sequencing. The SDS-PAGE results showed that the peptides encoded by these gene inserts were degraded in the corresponding fusion proteins (data not shown). Finally, the two inserts larger than 150 nucleotides or 50 deduced amino acid (aa) residues that were identified were ssPtu-15 (residues 1118-1175 of the original protein) and ssPtu-16 (residues 1129-1186).

Often, one N-terminal HR region (HR1) is adjacent to the cell fusion peptide while a C-terminal HR region (HR2) is close to the transmembrane anchor. The SARS fragment ssPtu-15 isolated in this work overlaps with the HR2 (residues 1147-1185) of the SARS-CoV spike protein[16], while fragment ssPtu-16 contains the whole SARS HR2 (Fig. 3a\n). A hydrophobic cluster analysis[17] of these two fragments showed two significant hydrophobic clusters (Figs. 3b, 3c, and 3d). Presumably, these clusters play a role in the stability and oligomeric specificity of the HR2 structure[18]. In addition, compared with the wild-type sequence, both of the fragments contain a mutation at 1163 (K replaced by E). ssPtu-16 also contains a second mutation at 1151 (from I to T), while ssPtu-15 contains a second mutation at 1157 (S substituted by Y). These mutations are likely a result from the fragment reassembly process. The mutation at 1163 seems to increase the helicity of the fragments. Interestingly, our more recent dissection studies with other proteins rarely resulted in mutations.",

For the majority of these peptides, micromolar concentrations were required for efficient inhibition of the viral infection, indicating that although these peptides are effective, further optimization is required to achieve efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV in infected individuals. Given the high similarity of ssPtu-15 and ssPtu-16 with these peptides derived from the HR2 region6, 7, 8, ssPtu-15 and ssPtu-16 may both have potential as therapeutic agents for the direct inhibition of SARS-CoV cell entry, as an anti-SARS vaccine, and as a high throughput assay for screening for small molecule inhibitors of SARS envelope-mediated cell fusion.",

The method is target protein independent and thus can be applied to various viral proteins. The process is also simple and rapid. The method should be applicable for dissecting and understanding other non-viral proteins, for example, to identify smaller polypeptide units that are structurally, functionally, or evolutionally relevant.",
