Recommendations for perioperative care in this context, including contact and droplet isolation precautions, negative pressure operating rooms, and specialized personal protective equipment (PPE), have been published [1] [2] [3] . However, due to the rapidly evolving understanding of COVID-19-related care, their operationalization is challenging and unevenly applied.",

The huddle was designed by a multidisciplinary team -front-line anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses, as well as the operating room (OR) director and leaders in perioperative quality and safety. The huddle participants include the OR Desk Nurse in Charge, Anesthesia Floor Leader, OR Staff Nurse, Attending Anesthesiologist, Attending Surgeon, and Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) Charge Nurse. The huddle is initiated by the OR Desk Nurse-in-Charge and the Anesthesia Floor Leader, who convenes the huddle after the surgeon books the procedure with the OR Desk Nurse in Charge. Participants discuss the risk of contamination (COVID-19 status), risk of aerosolization, need for a negative pressure OR, and minimum personnel for the case -this discussion then informs plans for obtaining and using PPE, transporting the patient to and from the OR, and location of post-procedure recovery. These items were chosen from issues encountered in safety reports, direct feedback from staff, and training drills, while keeping a view to required steps to perioperative patient flow. Huddle elements are described in Table 1 .",

Each week, we used a different case to simulate the pre-procedure COVID-19 huddle (ex. emergency laparotomy), with a group of anesthesiologists, nurses, and surgeons, while clarifying current policies and collecting feedback from front-line staff. Staff feedback regarding the huddle and drills was positive among anesthesiologists, nurses, and surgeons. Examples include: \"The Wed morning drills are great but how about every day for the next 1-2 weeks?\", \"[Surgeon] went to yesterday's drill and thought it was terrific\", \"\u2026 the drill went extremely well in the cardiac pod this morning\". \"[Nurse] \u2026 it was helpful to practice as a team and talk through concerns. I feel like we are all on the same page.\" Constructive feedback was used to improve the huddle, such as adding the PACU Charge Nurse to aid in recovery planning and incorporating plans to minimize staff in the case, to avoid excess exposure and PPE use.",
