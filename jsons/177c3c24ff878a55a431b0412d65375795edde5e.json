            "text": "The mammalian interferon (IFN) is a multifunctional family of cytokines that have a key role in the host immune response to viral infections. 1 IFN family members are grouped into three types, type I, II and III, each of which exerts their functions through the unique receptor complex. Type I IFNs are represented by IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, type II by IFN-\u03b3, and type III by IFN-\u03bb family. 2 IFN-\u03bb family consists of four members, IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, IFN-\u03bb3 and the newly discovered IFN-\u03bb4 that is coded by four functional IFN-\u03bb (IFNL) genes, IFNL1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively. IFN-\u03bb1, 2 and 3 are highly similar to each other in the amino-acid sequences. The amino-acid identity between IFNL1 and IFNL2/3 is~81%, and the identity between IFNL2 and IFNL3 is~96%. 3 IFNL4 is most similar to IFNL3 compared to IFNL1 and IFNL2, but even that similarity is still very low, IFNL4 has only 29.1% amino-acid identity with IFNL3. 4 They have similar residues in the area that is known to interact with the primary receptor of IFN-\u03bbs (IFN-\u03bb R1) but differ in the region of IFNL3 that interacts with the second chain of the IFN-\u03bb receptor complex, IL-10R2. 4 IFNL4 genome contains a dinucleotide variant, IFNL4-\u0394G/TT (rs368234815, originally designated as ss469415590) in exon 1 of IFNL4, upstream of IFN-\u03bb3 on chromosome 19q13.13. The IFNL4-\u0394G allele generates a functional IFN-\u03bb4 protein p179 (179 aa) by introducing a frameshift mutation that enables transcription, and the homozygous TT genotype creates a premature stop codon and thus knockouts this gene. IFN-\u03bb4 expresses in a small fraction of Asian and about half of European populations, but in most of Africans. 4 Genetic studies have demonstrated that IFNL4-TT allele has a strong positive correlation with HCV clearance, treatment outcome of HCV infection, and innate resistance to HIV infection, on the contrary, IFNL4-\u0394G allele is associated with the impairment of HCV clearance, and unfavourable clinical and immunological status in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. [4] [5] [6] But there was also evidence supported that IFNL4 genotype is not associated with the antiviral interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) expression and HIV load in chronic HIV infection. 7 Studies from different laboratories have documented that IFN-\u03bb1, 2 and 3 have the ability to inhibit HIV replication. [8] [9] [10] It is unknown, however, whether IFN-\u03bb4 has anti-HIV activity. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03bb4 on HIV infection of macrophages, a major target of HIV infection and potential longterm HIV reservoir. We also examined whether IFN-\u03bb4 acts through signalling of IFN-\u03bbR1/IL-10R2, the key receptor complex for IFN-\u03bb1, 2 and 3.",

Macrophages were pre-treated with IFN-\u03bb4 at the indicated concentrations for 24 h before HIV Bal strain infection overnight, with IFN-\u03bb1 (100 ng/mL) as a positive control. Supernatant was collected for HIV RT activity analysis at day 3, 6 and 9 post-infection. Results are representative of three experiments with cells from three different donors. **P < 0.01. B, IFN-\u03bb4 simultaneous or post-treatment inhibits HIV infection of macrophages. Macrophages were treated with or without IFN-\u03bb4 (500 ng/mL) during or after the incubation with HIV Bal strain. Cells were washed 3 times, and fresh DMEM with 5% FCS and IFN-\u03bb4 (500 ng/mL) was added to the cell cultures. IFN-\u03bb1 (100ng/mL) was used as a positive control.

C, Antibodies to IFN-\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2 block anti-HIV effect of IFN-\u03bb4. Macrophages were incubated with HIV Bal strain overnight. Cells were washed 3 times and treated with antibody to IFN-\u03bbR1 (1 \u03bcg/mL) and/or IL-10R2 (5 \u03bcg/mL) for 1 h prior to the addition of IFN-\u03bb4 (250 ng/mL). Sheep IgG (5 \u03bcg/mL) was used as a negative control. Supernatant was collected for HIV RT activity analysis at day 3 post-treatment. Results are representative of three experiments with cells from three donors. HIV RT activities were compared between the group treated with IFN-\u03bb4 alone and the other groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 inhibit HIV replication, 8-10 it remains to be determined whether IFN-\u03bb4 possesses the anti-HIV function. In the present study, we treated macrophages with different doses of IFN-\u03bb4 before, simultaneous or after HIV infection. HIV RT activities reduced in macrophage culture supernatant at days 3, 6 and 9 post-infection when treated with IFN-\u03bb4 24 hours prior to the viral infection (",
