In these studies, burden was a mediator of other outcome variables and was shown to be strongly related to sleep disturbances (Happe and Berger, 2002) and depressive symptoms in caregivers (Song et al., 1997). Burden is negatively related to health-related quality of life, particularly mental health (Morimoto et al., 2003). Furthermore, burden is negatively associated with caregivers\u2019 positive appraisal of their relationships with their ill family members (Pickett et al., 1997). Efforts have been made to reduce the burden of care in carers (Marriott et al., 2000).",

One study indicated that caregivers often experience several physical problems, including back injuries, arthritis, high blood pressure, gastric ulcers, and headaches (Sawatzky and Fowler-Kerry, 2003). Although these physical problems may not be directly caused by caregiving responsibilities, they are likely aggravated by them. Other research has found that the physical health of caregivers of long-term patients declined after the patients were discharged from hospital (Douglas and Daly, 2003). These studies indicate that caring for an ill family member at home is negatively related to physical health.",

After excluding 12 agencies which care for less than 20 clients or that were converted to care for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients instead of home-care clients, 16 home-care agencies serving 588 cases were eligible. We included only those individuals who were 18 years or older and spent most of their time taking care of at least one ill family member at home. Among the eligible cases, 50 were institutionalized, 96 refused or did not complete the interview, and 54 were cared for by hired carers and their families could not be reached. This resulted in a total of 388 family caregivers (\u223c66%) of clients served by these agencies, recruited between 20 June 2003 and 30 November 2003. All the clients were physically ill. Over half of them were unconscious (Chiou et al., 2005), with 84.7% being totally dependent. A considerable number of care receivers were suffering from cerebrovascular disease (66.8%), followed by diabetes (28.6%) and cardiovascular disease (19.8%) (Chiou et al., 2005).

Our results are in line with the findings of Savard et al. (2006), who reported that caregivers receiving information, advice, or emotional support were more likely to be highly satisfied. Although we found that the use of functional support systems also decreased mental stress, the effect was not statistically significant. This may be due to a low level of awareness of the existence of these functional support systems or how to apply for them. Thus, based on our findings, the Taiwanese public health community and social service providers should strengthen and promote existing support systems as well as design new systems to ease the mental stress of family caregivers. The social workers or public health nurses should reach out the caregivers in the communities to help them use the existing or newly developed support systems.",
