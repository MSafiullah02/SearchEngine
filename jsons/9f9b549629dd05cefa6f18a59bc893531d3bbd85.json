As this host-parasite system evolves towards an equilibrium, its epidemiology has been studied extensively, but with some conflicting results [2, 3] . The true extent of its penetration into the population is as yet open to question [4] , since testing is fairly restricted in most countries. Nor is the progression of the disease, COVID-19, or its method of spread completely clear [5] . Since the virus is already so widely established, it seems unlikely that it will be totally eliminated soon. So it is important to extract basic epidemiological parameters as cleanly as possible.",

At the end of April the proportion of identified cases in India as a whole was a few tens per million, with 1-2 orders of magnitude more in hot spots. Even if this were wrong by an order of magnitude, it would still mean that the epidemic remains at an early stage in India. This, combined with the lock-down, presents an opportunity to examine the growth of the epidemic in multiple isolated regions which implement essentially the same policy with regard to testing. This study examines the heterogeneity in the growth rate of the disease, in several ways. First, the doubling intervals, \u03c4 , of the cumulative number of identified cases, C(t), and the cumulative number of fatalities, D(t), is examined. From \u03c4 it is possible to extract the basic reproduction rate, R 0 , within epidemic models. Marked heterogeneity are observed. After this the correlation between the case fatality ratio, CFR, and R 0 is studied.",

Estimates of the fraction of asymptomatic infections range as high as 80% [11] , implying that, in this extreme case, the testing policy can never reveal more than 20% of the cases.

These shuffle a fraction of the numbers from one day to another, and therefore cause errors in the daily counts. As long as the number of facilities keep pace with the growth of the epidemic, these errors remain proportional to the number of cases and fatalities. Since the wait time for hospital beds for COVID-19 cases has remained roughly constant during the period of study, this argument is expected to hold. In view of this, of 20% of the reported values of C(t) and D(t) are assigned as errors.

Of the regions that we analysed, most cities show an initial rapid growth followed by a tempered growth. The exceptions are Ahmedabad and Chennai among cities, and the states of Gujarat, Kerala, and West Bengal. Note that day one is taken to be March 31, 2020, which is 7 days after the beginning of the national lock-down. Since t 2 = 17.8 days, it might be expected that the growth rate of cases in the pre-lock-down period could manifest itself in that of fatalities until around day 11. In case of a successful lock-down, D(t) could then show an initial exponential growth, tempered after day 11. The initial data for fatalities in Delhi, Indore, Mumbai and Pune can indeed be described by an exponential. However, the doubling interval in Pune turns out to be half of that in Mumbai, although the average population density of Mumbai is about 6 times larger than the average in Pune city.",

In most locations the initial doubling interval seems to be between half and day and two days. When converted to R 0 , one obtains extremely high values, far in excess of what has been quoted in the literature. Certainly R 0 could vary from place to place, since it depends on infectivity of the virus as well as the social networks in each location, and the latter may change from one place to another. However, \u03c4 0 for Pune is one third that of Mumbai, when Mumbai has six times the average population density. The wrong dependence of the doubling time for fatalities on population density, together with the observation that C(t) shows a growth till the same date, supports the idea that there could be a more parsimonious explanation for this common period of growth. This is discussed in the next section. At the moment, any statistical evidence for a gradual slowing of the growth rate of the epidemic is hidden due to some confounding factors. In view of this, the analysis was continued with a constant doubling interval, \u03c4 , applying it to the period after day 10 or 11. For this part of the analysis data was from three states, namely Gujarat, Kerala, and West Bengal, was also used. From Figure 1 , one sees that this simpler model provides as good a description of the data as the model of eq. (1). Furthermore, this yields more realistic values of R 0 implies that during the lock-down each of these places has seen a location dependent constant doubling interval. The values of \u03c4 , along with inferred values of R 0 , are collected in Table II . These are the primary results of this analysis.",

This is a reflection of the relative paucity of medical services outside cities, and is a pointer to what might happen when the number of infections rises beyond the sustainable capacity of hospitals.",

If one instead uses the SIR model, then it is appropriate to choose the unit of time to be the median interval between the beginning of the infection and the earlier of the time of fatality or recovery.
