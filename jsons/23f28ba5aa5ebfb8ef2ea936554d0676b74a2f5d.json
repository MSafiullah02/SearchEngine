Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually requires laborious, manual analysis by experts to annotate millions of tweets to identify biases in new topics. We introduce extensions of the Word Embedding Association Test from Caliskan et. al to a new domain (Caliskan et al., 2017) . This practical and unsupervised method is applied to quantify biases being promoted in information operations. Analyzing historical information operations from Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we quantify biased attitudes for presidential candidates, and sentiment toward Muslim groups. We next apply this method to a corpus of tweets containing anti-Chinese hashtags. We find that roughly 1% of tweets in our corpus reference Russian-funded news sources and use anti-Chinese hashtags and, beyond the expected anti-Chinese attitudes, we find that this corpus as a whole contains pro-Russian attitudes, which are not present in a control Twitter corpus containing general tweets. Additionally, 4% of the users in this corpus were suspended within a week. These findings may indicate the presence of abusive account activity associated with rapid changes in attitudes around the COVID-19 public health crisis, suggesting potential information operations.",

Here, we find that tweets pertaining to COVID-19 and expressing anti-Chinese sentiment seem to express pro-Russian sentiment. These preliminary findings showcase a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool, an extension of Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) (Caliskan et al., 2017) , that researchers studying malicious information operations may use to further guide research. Specifically, our findings point to the need for future work to determine whether this pro-Russian sentiment is the result of genuine grassroots attitudes or coordinated inauthentic behavior (e.g., a trolling campaign).",

Here, we select a practical, unsupervised AI method that identifies biases present in large text corpora and extend it to emerging domains. Specifically, we choose word lists to represent information operation biases that are present in emerging domains that do not have historical samples. Our technique can be applied to new trending topics, including those reflecting suspected information opera-tions, when annotated data is not readily available. We validate our method by measuring known anti-Muslim negative biases and negative associations with a major presidential candidate during the 2016 U.S. elections, both of which are present in word embeddings trained on corpora generated by a known Russian influence campaign (twi, 2018; Howard et al., 2019) . We next collect Twitter data, with tweets containing anti-Chinese hashtags, over the course of one week to investigate potential biased associations present in this public dataset. Since the COVID-19 outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, we expected, and found, indications of expressions of anti-Chinese biases. We further demonstrate that these biases are associated with expressions of panic and negative sentiment. Surprisingly, the same corpus associates Russia with expressions of calm and positive sentiment.",

Word embeddings are vector space representations of semantics learned via the distributional hypothesis. Extending Caliskan et al.'s WEAT, we examine biases in word embeddings trained on tweets related to COVID-19. WEAT quantifies human-like biases and cultural stereotypes between two target groups and two sets of polar attributes. Caliskan et al. use these tests in word embeddings to replicate biased associations documented by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) by using word sets in the IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998) . We extend the WEAT to our research domain by creating bias tests for political leaders and countries: Calm-Panic, Trustworthy-Untrustworthy, and Pleasant-Unpleasant. Calm-Panic addresses the extent to which text may express panic within a group, whereas Trustworthy-Untrustworthy addresses the extent to which text might frame a group as untrustworthy. Finally, we include the original Pleasant-Unpleasant bias test to measure general negative bias against an opposing group. Kurdi et al. and Werntz et al. provide word sets that represent the polar extremes of trustworthy, untrustworthy, panic, and calm sentiments that we use in our bias tests (Kurdi et al., 2019; Werntz et al., 2016) .",

For TWITTER-G, we use the pre-trained, Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) Twitter word embeddings, which are widely used Twitter word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) . We used the GloVe Twitter word embeddings with 27 billion tokens and 200-dimensional vectors. The TWITTER-G word embeddings contain similar bias scores to the reported scores by Caliskan et al., showing that they capture known human-like biases and cultural stereotypes (Caliskan et al., 2017) . We generate word embeddings using the GloVe algorithm for the COVID-G and COVID-AC corpora since GloVe is known to capture semantics most accurately. In order to validate our methods, we use two Twitter datasets (twi, 2018) with ground truth information on bias associations: i) RU-DISINFO, a corpus that contains Russian information operation tweets released by Twitter in January 2019, and ii) IRA-DISINFO, a Twitter corpus released in October 2018 that contains tweets traced to Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA). These tweets were collected by Twitter if they were flagged to be involved with \"state-backed information operations\".

These Russia vs. country-x WEAT tests indicated positive pro-Russian biases associating Russia with calm and positive valence. Some of these results were not statistically significant since we were not able to identify 8 words to represent many countries accurately for the WEAT test. COVID-AC embeddings are trained on a small corpus thus identifying 8 neutral words in COVID-AC's dictionary to represent countries such as Bulgaria, Greece, Singapore, and Taiwan accurately is a challenging task. Aforementioned countries were not affected by the COVID-19 outbreak as intensely compared to Russia during our data collection period.

We quantify biases towards political candidates and Muslims in these prior information operations. We quantify pro-Russian and anti-Chinese biases in addition to associations of China with fear and panic in recent COVID-19 related public Twitter data. Various domains can apply this practical method by selecting the desired opposing groups (e.g., Russia vs. China) to discover and measure the present biases. These methods could be used to characterize attitudes on several different social media platforms in advance of major world events, such as the upcoming U.S. presidential election, or the quickly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, by automatically identifying emerging biases. If unexpected biases are detected, researchers might then examine whether these could be artificially and deliberately introduced to the public sphere.",
