            "text": "To verify the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in neurons of the human spinal cord, we investigated the presence and distribution of CFTR protein and mRNA in different segments of the human spinal cord obtained from autopsies. The techniques employed included reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect CFTR gene expression, in situ hybridization to detect mRNA distribution, and immunohistochemistry to detect protein distribution. The specificity of these experiments was established with extensive controls. We found widespread and abundant expression of CFTR in neurons of the human spinal cord. CFTR protein and mRNA are localized to the cytoplasm of neurons in all segments of the spinal cord but not to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells. CFTR is a very important molecule, acting as a chloride channel and regulating many physiological functions, including salt transport, fluid flow, and intracellular ion concentrations. Its mutation causes cystic fibrosis. Our finding of abundant CFTR in the spinal cord suggests that this molecule may be significant in the normal function and pathology of the spinal cord.

Consequently, CFTR has also been found to be expressed in the reproductive tract (Rochwerger and Buchwald, 1993; Tizzano et al., 1994; Zheng et al., 2004) and immune cells (McDonald et al., 1992) . associates (1995, 1998) found CFTR expressed in rat brain and human hypothalamus.

The PCR was carried out by using the DNA Engine Opticon Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The reaction system was optimized and checked by performing standard curves running on serial dilutions of cDNA (R 2 > 0.98). The PCRs were optimized also by comparing Cts among duplicate samples (difference of Cts <0.5). The primers for CFTR PCR were as follows: sense primer 5 0 -AGGAG-GAACGCTCTATCG-3 0 , antisense primer 5 0 -GCA-GACGCCTGTAACAAC-3 0 . The PCR product of CFTR should be 328 base pairs. The GAPDH gene was taken as an endogenous control to evaluate the CFTR gene expression levels. The primers for GAPDH were as follows: sense primer 5 0 -ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3 0 , antisense primer 5 0 -TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3 0 . The PCR product of GAPDH should be 452 base pairs. Different primer concentrations in the suggested range by the Taq DNA polymerase manufacturer's protocol were tested. The optimal concentrations of primers were used for the quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The amplification of PCR began with a hot-start reaction for 10 min at 948C and then proceeded for 40 cycles at 948C for 30 sec, 548C for 30 sec, and 728C for 30 sec, followed by fluorescent measurements in each cycle. The final cycle was followed by a 728C extension for 5 min. A melt curve analysis step was done following PCR. The PCRs for CFTR and GAPDH gene were performed with the same conditions. To verify the PCR product and exclude nonspecific amplification, melt curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed. A 100-bp DNA ladder, Marker 1 (MD101; Tiangen), was used as a DNA weigh standard in the agarose gel electrophoresis. To assess whether the difference in mRNA level in the different tissues was statistically significant, one-way ANOVA was performed.",

            "text": "The significance of CFTR expression in neurons throughout the human spinal cord is twofold. First, it suggests that this molecule may play a role in normal function of the human spinal cord, particularly in view of its previously identified cellular functions and physiology. For example, as a phosphorylation-dependent epithelial chloride channel, CFTR is expressed in the plasma membrane and membrane of organelles (Denning et al., 1992; Mohamed et al., 1997; Benharouga et al., 2003) , and plays a key role in regulating the steady state of cellular electrolytes via regulation of salt transport, fluid flow, and ion concentrations (Egan et al., 1992; Sheppard and Welsh, 1999) . It has been proposed that CFTR could regulate the activity of membrane proteins through direct protein-protein interactions (Stutts et al., 1995) or by modulating membrane trafficking (Prince et al., 1994) . CFTR can also mediate ATP hydrolysis, thereby regulating the flux of glutathione (GSH), which in turn serves in the regulation of protein/enzyme function (Kogan et al., 2003) . It also functions as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter (Janaky et al., 1999) . It has been reported that CFTR is critical for cAMP-dependent regulation of membrane recycling (Bradbury et al., 1992) . The interactions among three important molecules, CFTR, adenosine triphosphate, and glutathione, may profoundly affect neuronal function (Aoyama et al., 2008; Yue et al., 2008) . After detection of CFTR in the hypothalamus, it was proposed that CFTR might be involved in regulating energy utilization, sexual maturation, and reproductive behavior (Mulberg et al., 1995 (Mulberg et al., , 1998 Weyler et al., 1999) . The results of these studies provide a link between CFTR and neuronal functions of the central nervious system. Second, mutation or alteration of this molecule may induce CNS dysfunction in CF or other neural diseases. More than 1,500 mutations of CFTR gene have been identified in CF (Radpour et al., 2008) . Different mutations can result in different disorders, including the failure of CFTR trafficking to the cell membrane, reduced channel activity, and abnormal splicing of the CFTR mRNA (McAuley and Elborn, 2000) . When these mutations of the CFTR gene occur as in CF, the functions of CFTR in neurons may be altered, thus affecting the normal CNS function. Dystrophic axons in the nucleus gracilis and demyelination of the fasciculus gracilis have been reported in CF patients, with 66% developing dystrophic axons (Cavalier and Gambetti, 1981) . Subclinical extrapyramidal hemosiderosis has also been reported in CF (Wongmongkolrit et al., 1985) . Such findings cannot be explained by the pathological changes in the lungs or other organs typically associated with CF. Mutant CFTR may accumulate in the cytoplasm that could block the molecular transmission in the cell (Gentzsch et al., 2007) . Accumulation and failure in the transmission of molecules could cause cell dystrophy (Gentzsch et al., 2007) . Furthermore, Clhomeostasis determines the efficacy of synaptic inhibition in the motoneurons (Ueno et al., 2002) . CFTR, as a Clchannel, has been suggested to participate in the control of Clhomeostasis and neuronal excitability in rat spinal cord (Ostroumov et al., 2007) . Our results of expression of CFTR in human spinal cord provide a basis for the relationship between CFTR mutation and the neuronal symptoms seen in CF.",

A-C: Immunohistochemistry of the transverse section of the C3, T6, and L1 segments, respectively. The positive cells were not visible at this magnification. Enlarged images of regions in A-C defined by labeled squares are shown in A1-3, B1,2, and C1,2, respectively. A1: Enlarged image of the region labeled in A, showing CFTR immunoreactivity in neurons of the anterior horn of the C3 segment of the spinal cord. A2: Neurons of the posterior horn also contained CFTR positivity. A3: Transverse section of nerve bundles in the spinal cord. The nerve fibers contain CFTR-positive signals. B: Immunohistochemistry results of the transverse section of T6 segment of the human spinal cord. B1 is a high-power view of a region labeled in the panel demonstrating CFTR immunoreactivity in neurons in the anterior horn of the T6 segment of human spinal cord. B2: Neurons in the posterior horn of T6 segment are also CFTR positive. C: Transverse section of L1 segment of the human spinal cord. Higher power images of defined regions are shown in C1 (the anterior horn) and C2 (the posterior horn). Scale bars 5 0.5 cm in A-C; 20 lm in A1-C2.",

            "text": "CFTR expressions in neurons of the human spinal cord demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. A: Immunohistochemistry results for CFTR in human cervical spinal cord. The brown positive signals indicating CFTR protein presence were developed with DAB. Most neurons (based on visual impression), including motor neurons, show positive signals. B: Highpower picture of a part of the field in A. A and B show the signals in the cytoplasm of neuron bodies, dendrites, and axons. C: Immunohistochemistry results for CFTR in human pancreas as a positive control. The brown positive signals indicating CFTR exist at the glandular lumen of the pancreas exocrine gland. D,E: Immunohistochemistry for CFTR and NF on serial sections taken from a cervical cord segment. The area shown is from the anterior horn. The brown CFTR-positive signals are localized to the cytoplasm of the neurons. The red positive signals were developed with AEC. The same neurons shown in two consecutive sections is indicated with numbered arrows. CFTR-positive cells also show NF-positive signals, indicating that these CFTR-positive cells are neurons. H,I: Results of in situ hybridization of CFTR and immunohistochemistry of NF on serial sections. H shows the results of in situ hybridization of CFTR mRNA. The purple signal was colorized with alkaline phosphatase and demonstrates that CFTR mRNA is present in the cytoplasm of positive cells. I shows that these positive cells are NF-positive neurons. The left top corners of each figure show high-power pictures of the boxed areas. The same three cells show both positive in situ hybridization signals of CFTR and positive immunohistochemistry signals of NF. F: Negative control for immunohistochemistry of CFTR. G: Negative control for CFTR mRNA in situ hybridization. J: Double-labeling results combining in situ hybridization of CFTR mRNA (purple blue) and immunohistochemistry of GFAP (red), a marker for glial cells. These results demonstrate that CFTR mRNA is present in neurons but not in the GFAP-positive cells. Scale bars 5 20 lm.",
