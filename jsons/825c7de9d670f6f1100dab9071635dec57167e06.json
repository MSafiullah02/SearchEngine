Diversity accumulated on the IFNL4--TT haplotype is expected to be propor@onal to the @me the variant is present in a popula@on, under the assump@ons that the \u0394G>TT muta@on happened only once, and that nearby variants are largely neutral. As derived TT is a complex muta@on and leads to inac@va@on of IFNL4 both assump@ons are reasonable.",

First, using only homozygous individuals excluded inaccurate phasing as a source of error. All popula@ons had at least nine homozygous TT/TT individuals (which we randomly chose) except ASW that had only seven. Second, it is known that the level of diversity across human popula@ons varies. To put our results in the context of neutral popula@on diversity we also es@mated diversity for a set of pseudogenes across the genome in the same individuals. Specifically, we used a set of pseudogenes recently described by GENCODE [1] , which integrated func@onal genomic informa@on from ENCODE [2] . We required every pseudogene to be autosomal and of retrotransposi@on origin, and to lack any indica@on of transcrip@onal ac@vity or open chroma@n state. This resulted in 867 pseudogenes throughout the human genome covering a total of 560 Kb. As a measure of diversity we used the Wa\\erson es@mator [3] , which is based on the number of segrega@ng sites.",

Specifically, we es@mate the highest diversity for TT haplotypes and the control regions in LWK (Luhya, Kenya, East Africa). However, the diversity in LWK for the TT haplotypes in comparison to YRI (second most diverse; Yoruba, Nigeria, West Africa) is 25% higher while in the control regions this is merely 3%. Even though a chi--square test is not significant (P-value = 0.69) due to small sample size, this excess of diversity for LWK suggests that TT may have appeared in a popula@on in Africa more closely related to the LWK popula@on. Outside of Africa only one TT haplotype is present, which carries the TT allele and three linked sites (data not shown). In Africa, addi@onal low--frequency variants accumulated on the TT haplotype. The physical posi@on of these low--frequency variants is interspersed with the high--frequency variants in the locus. Thus the results indicate an African origin, most likely in a popula@on that was closer to present--day East African popula@ons such as LWK.",
