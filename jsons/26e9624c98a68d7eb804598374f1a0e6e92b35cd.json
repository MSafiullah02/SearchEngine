In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied to study the microbiota shed in the feces of different host species. The entirety of viruses present in the feces of a host is called the fecal virome and analysis of its composition in piglets is of great interest for several reasons. First, it allows investigators to distinguish viruses which can induce clinical disease (diarrhea), subclinical growth retardation, or even (apathogenic/benefical) viruses which do not cause symptoms. Second, some of the viruses shed in the feces of piglets can also cause zoonotic infections in humans and rotaviruses are a well described example Zeller et al., 2012) . In previous studies the fecal virome of healthy and diarrheic pigs has been investigated. Shan and colleagues reported the virome composition of healthy and diarrheic pigs on a high-density pig farm in North Carolina, United States. On average, 4.2 and 5.2 mammalian viruses were shed by non-diarrheic and diarrheic piglets, respectively. Most dominant viruses were kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses and teschoviruses. However, boca-and coronaviruses were more abundant in diarrheic animals (Shan et al., 2011) . A process-controlled method, based on the addition of a defined amount of bacteriophages to allow for comparison between different samples, was applied by Sachsenr\u00f6der and colleagues to investigate the fecal virome retrieved from a pooled fecal sample of five 35 days old pigs. Two of five animals had diarrhea at the moment of sampling (Sachsenroder et al., 2012) . Most viruses detected could be classified as bacteriophages (73.9%), mammalian viruses (23.9%) or plant viruses (0.8%). Kobuvirus, group C rotavirus, Chimpanzee stool associated circular ssDNA virus, astrovirus and enterovirus were the most abundant mammalian viruses found in this study (Sachsenroder et al., 2012) . Zhang and colleagues reported the detection of 15 distinct mammalian viruses in a pooled fecal sample of 27 diarrheic piglets from China (Zhang et al., 2014) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, sapovirus, bocavirus, sapelovirus and torovirus were most abundant (Zhang et al., 2014) . To study the virome composition, standardized procedures that are useful in laboratory settings are needed. Recently, a standardized protocol for sample preparation, called NetoVIR (Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes), was established in our laboratory to allow researchers to apply high throughput viral metagenomics to study fecal viromes (Conceicao-Neto et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 671, "text": "Zeller et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1247, "text": "(Shan et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1614, "text": "(Sachsenroder et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1932, "text": "(Sachsenroder et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2092, "text": "(Zhang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2215, "text": "(Zhang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2591, "text": "(Conceicao-Neto et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Rotaviruses have been recognized as an important cause of diarrhea in young pigs and children.

The viral genome also encodes 6 different non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP6). The genus Rotavirus is subdivided into 9 different species (A to H) .

Due to its segmented genome, reassortant viruses can be created upon dual infection of a single cell with different virus strains. To detect such a reassortment event and to characterize rare RVA strains in human surveillance studies, a full genome-based classification system was established for RVAs (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a; Matthijnssens et al., 2008b) . The outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 are important in this classification system, as they can induce the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, intracellular neutralizing antibodies targeting VP6 may also play an important role in clearing RVA infections (Aiyegbo et al., 2014; Aiyegbo et al., 2013) . Many VP7 (n = 28) and VP4 (n = 39) genotypes have been detected in multiple species (Matthijnssens et al., 2011; Matthijnssens and Theuns, 2015; Trojnar et al., 2013) . In pigs, a large diversity of VP7/VP4 genotypes can be encountered (Amimo et al., 2013; Chandler-Bostock et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2010; Martella et al., 2005; Papp et al., 2013; Pham et al., 2014) . As an example, six different G-genotypes for VP7 (G2, G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11), and five different P-genotypes for VP4 (P[6], P[7], P[13], P[23] and P[27]) were recently encountered in 12 different G/P combinations in feces from Belgian diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets (Theuns et al., 2014) . Overall, these pig RVA strains possessed a relatively conserved pig genetic backbone for the other 9 gene segments, namely I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1, which demonstrated a clear evolutionary relationship with genes of dominant human Wa-like RVA strains (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a; Theuns et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 479, "text": "(Matthijnssens et al., 2008a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 480, "end": 508, "text": "Matthijnssens et al., 2008b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 780, "end": 802, "text": "(Aiyegbo et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 803, "end": 824, "text": "Aiyegbo et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 911, "end": 939, "text": "(Matthijnssens et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 940, "end": 971, "text": "Matthijnssens and Theuns, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 972, "end": 993, "text": "Trojnar et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1083, "text": "(Amimo et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1114, "text": "Chandler-Bostock et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1136, "text": "Collins et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1159, "text": "Martella et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1178, "text": "Papp et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1197, "text": "Pham et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1493, "text": "(Theuns et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1778, "text": "(Matthijnssens et al., 2008a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1799, "text": "Theuns et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Group C rotavirus (RVC) is being considered as an etiological cause of diarrhea in young pigs, but the virus has also been detected in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets at a lower prevalence rate (Bohl et al., 1982; Collins et al., 2008; Marthaler et al., 2014; Saif et al., 1980) . A genotype classification system for RVC VP7 encoding genes has been established. Pig strains typically belong to genotypes G1, G3, G5, G6-G10, whereas human and cow RVCs belong to genotypes G4 and G2, respectively (Marthaler et al., 2013) . Recently, two different VP4 nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values have been established to assign RVC strains into specific VP4 genotypes (Jeong et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2014a) . Similar nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values have been identified to classify RVC VP6 genes into distinct genotypes (Jeong et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2014b) .

Cross-neutralization assays have been applied to classify astroviruses into different serotypes, but this has been hampered by the lack of viral growth in cell culture. Nowadays, classification is more often performed using genetic analysis of ORF2, which is the most variable astrovirus gene (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Lee and Kurtz, 1982) . Still, the current classification is not able to cope with the wide genetic diversity among porcine astroviruses. It also remains difficult to associate these infections with disease, as these viruses have also been isolated from healthy pigs as well (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Mor et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2013) . This is in contrast to humans, where some species have been associated with diarrhea (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Jarchow-Macdonald et al., 2015; Medici et al., 2014; Xavier Mda et al., 2015) .

Recently, two research groups proposed distinct nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values to divide VP4 genes into distinct genotypes. Jeong and colleagues used an 83% cut-off value to classify the genes into 7 genotypes (P1 to P7), whereas Suzuki and colleagues used a cut-off value of 80% to distinguish 6 genotypes (P1 to P6). Still, it is difficult to find a consensus for all genotypes between both classification systems, which hampers the correct classification of new RVC strains, especially those of pigs. The genotype P5 is shared between both classification systems, and contained the Belgian pig strain. It has been demonstrated for the RVA VP4 proteins that the highly variable VP8* domain within VP4 possesses the capacity to recognize different carbohydrate moieties dependent on the genotype (Coulson, 2015) . As an example, strains bearing the typical pig genotype P[7] recognize sialic acids, whereas differences in carbohydrate recognition have been observed between important human RVA genotypes P[6] and P[8] Liu et al., 2012; Nordgren et al., 2014) . RVCs also possess a highly variable VP8* domain. The dependence on sialic acids for binding and infection of cells was shown earlier for pig strain Cowden. This strain was also capable of hemagglutinating human type O, guinea pig and mouse red blood cells (Svensson, 1992) . Still, it might be that the diversity observed among genes encoding VP4 proteins of contemporary pig RVC strains results in the capacity to recognize and bind to a wider range of carbohydrate moieties present on mucus and enterocytes.

Also here, no consensus has yet been reached. As such, 12R021 can be seen as a tentative new genotype, together with strains from the Czech Republic. For pig RVAs, and for human RVAs from different genogroups, it was described that genotype-specific mutations were present at the VP7 interface of the VP6 proteins (Heiman et al., 2008; Theuns et al., 2015) . The diversity observed among pig RVCs might have similar purposes. First, it may allow for a better recognition of different VP7/VP4 proteins encoded by different genotypes, resulting in a better structural fit in mature particles. Second, the high diversity observed in VP6 might be the cause of immunological selection pressure as well. Indeed, VP6 proteins have an important immunological function which has long been underestimated. For RVAs it was demonstrated that the majority of antibodies are elicited against VP6, and unexpectedly less against the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 (Svensson et al., 1987) . Anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies are internalized at the basal side of enterocytes, undergo transcytosis, followed by excretion in the lumen as secretory IgA (SIgA). During transcytosis, antibodies against the RVA VP6 proteins are able to intracellularly neutralize viral replication by sterical blocking of type I channels in viral double layered particles, thereby hampering RNA egress during transcription (Aiyegbo et al., 2013) .

Indeed, most viral species are not routinely investigated in cases of diarrhea on pig farms. Here, a porcine astrovirus was detected in the fecal virome, which showed most similarity to a porcine astrovirus strain from Hungary. The clinical relevance of these astroviruses remains enigmatic and should be further investigated. A porcine enterovirus was also present in the fecal virome, but also for enteroviruses in piglets their role in the development of enteric diseases is being questioned in piglets, and have been more frequently associated with neurological problems and reproductive problems in pigs (Knowles, 2006) . Indeed, the roles of PoAstV and the porcine enterovirus in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea can also be questioned here, as this piglet did not demonstrate any symptoms of diarrhea at the moment of sampling. Still, these subclinical infections may have had an impact on pig growth, which has been ascribed for instance to porcine circovirus infections (Maes, 2012) . Nonetheless, the detection of all these viruses provided only a picture at one time-point, and the history and outcome of these infections is unknown. In view of future studies in the field, analyses of the fecal viromes of diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets will likely enable the discovery of new viruses that are part of yet unspecified intestinal disease complexes. These might contribute to clinical enteric diseases or result in growth retardation in subclinically infected young piglets. Standardized protocols, which allow studying viral metagenomics in a high throughput manner without introducing major bias (such as the NetoVIR protocol), are definitely needed to execute such studies (Conceicao-Neto , 2015) .
