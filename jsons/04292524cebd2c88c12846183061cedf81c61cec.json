Public health authorities now consider it highly likely that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 will follow a pattern of seasonal circulation globally. To guide mitigation strategies and tactics in a location-specific manner, accurate simulation of prolonged or intermittent patterns of social/physical distancing is required in order to prevent healthcare systems and communities from collapsing. It is equally important to capture the stochastic appearance of individual transmission events. Traditional epidemiological/statistical models cannot make predictions in a geospatial temporal manner based on human individuals in a community. Thus, the challenge is to conduct spatio-temporal simulations of transmission chains with real-world geospatial and georeferenced information of the dynamics of the disease and the effect of different mitigation strategies such as isolation of infected individuals or location closures. Here, we present a stochastic, ge ospatially r eferenced and d emography-specific a gent-based model with agents representing human beings and include information on age, household composition, daily occupation and schedule, risk factors, and other relevant properties. Physical encounters between humans are modeled in a time-dependent georeferenced network of the population. The model (GERDA-1) can predict infection dynamics under normal conditions and test the effect of different mitigation scenarios such as school closures, reduced social contacts as well as closure or reopening of public/work spaces. Specifically, it also includes the fate and influence of health care workers and their access to protective gear. Key predictions so far entail:",

            "text": "To assist policy makers and governments in choosing different exit/re-entry strategies, data-driven mathematical and computational modelling can predict the path and severity of infection, the expected number of fatalities and the effect of different mitigation measures. Considering the lack of information about not only the disease itself but also its near-and long-term impact on healthcare systems and society, models are required to reliably predict the effect of alternative strategies to both \"re-open\" societies and allow the general population to return to work and social activities. Therefore, the scientific community has a great responsibility to create such mathematical models and ensure that the predictions are as precise and adapted to reality as possible, as the accuracy of the predictions can directly influence society. In short, there are chiefly two different computational modeling approaches used to predict the spread of a pathogen. On the one hand, deterministic models often use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to depict trajectories of defined variables that change over time and are dependent on population-level metrics, data and statistics. On the other hand, stochastic models, such as agent-based models (ABM), use a set of rules and probabilities in order to define the behavior of agents, in this case individuals, which can be tracked over time in order to extract population-level metrics that can always be traced back to their agent-level origin. In typical epidemiological models different groups of people can be considered based on common features (e.g. based on demographics, risk groups, age etc.), where particularly the group of susceptibles (S), the group of infected (I) and the group of recovered (R) individuals are usually of great interest [1] . Recovered individuals are assumed to have acquired immunity to some degree (though this is still an open question for SARS-CoV-2). The transition between these states depends on (i) a basic reproduction number R 0 describing how likely it is that infected individuals transmit the infection to susceptible individuals and (ii) parameters describing the recovery. More advanced models include further relevant states such as exposed (E), hospitalized (H) or being treated in an ICU, as recently presented by an ODE model of the Neher laboratory [see https://covid19-scenarios.org/ ]. An example for a respective ABM model has already been implemented in the tool Netlogo [3] .",

To this end, we developed an agent-based model that incorporates the accepted different stages of SARS-Cov-2 infection, COVID-19 disease and recovery that takes demographic data, realistic daily scenarios and, importantly, the physical location of individuals into consideration. GERDA-1 can predict the effects of different tailored scenarios and measures for mitigation depending on the location (e.g. workplace, school, public places such as shopping malls, etc) but also dependending on the actual time of day. To this end, we have integrated a large amount of publicly available data, e.g., on locations, age distribution, geographical information, and sociological data for typical numbers and types of social contacts in the German population. Most importantly, we have taken into account the distinct role of front-line health care workers, medical doctors and first-responders, because these groups are most exposed to the virus and therefore have an increased risk of contracting it. It is emerging that SARS-Cov-2 is inducing the disease in a dose-dependent manner, a characteristic that is particularly problematic for healthcare providers. Consequently, it is critical to model the burden and surge-requirements for hospitals/medical systems, as this very much depends on essential staff to ensure the functioning of the medical system including local doctor offices and hospitals.",

Therefore, GERDA-1 represents the virus propagation and effects of mitigation measures within a concrete (German) population. The model tracks the number of individuals with specific infection states at a specific physical location through time. Because the model is georeferenced, it makes use of the concrete number of residential buildings, workplaces, schools or public places in a given community/municipality as the space for potential infection chain initiation by human contact. The approach is displayed in Figure 1 . GERDA-1 is based on demographic data from the German census with respect to age distributions, household sizes and composition. As an example, we used data from the municipality Gangelt ( Figure 2A for a map), a place that experienced a widely noticed COVID-19 outbreak in Germany.

They have individual properties, such as age, risk, infection state and follow a specific weekly schedule. Each day, an individual visits locations in their geo-data-based world according to their own schedule. Individuals can with a certain likelihood either become infected or infect other individuals in these locations. Following an infection an individual can be diagnosed, admitted to hospital and/or ICU, recover or succumb to the disease. Mitigation measures influence the likelihood for infections, e.g., by excluding (closing down of) specific types of locations or by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).",

All buildings that are not labelled specifically are assigned as residential buildings or homes. If the input data did not contain a location for a hospital or morgue, these locations were added artificially at the margin of the world, during the initialization process (see Figure 2D ). Initializing the agent population: Each residential building is home to one household that was randomly drawn from a distribution, based on German census data. According to the respective household type and considering the reported demography, agents with adequate ages are randomly generated and given different properties such as profession, risk state and infection status (see Figure 2C ). Additionally each agent is assigned a specific weekly schedule, that comprises times spent at home, work, public places etc., which are based on predefined flexible schedules for different age groups and types of individuals (see Figure  2B ). These can differ from individual to individual and for different days of the week, e.g. the weekend.

As a result of the reduced infectivity, the infection wave runs through the population more slowly, i.e., the peak of (I) is lower (about 7000 individuals compared to 8000 at the higher rate) and also occurs later. At the end, fewer people have been infected and moved to the recovered state (about 9500 compared to about 10000 individuals). The reason for the lower number of infected and, therefore, recovered individuals is that in the case of a slower spread of the virus through the population, the overshoot in infected individuals is reduced [5] . To evaluate the influence of more strict measures to influence the course of the epidemic, we have simulated a series of potential scenarios for lockdown and release of lockdown measures. This includes closures of all locations except of homes and hospitals (i.e., workplaces, schools and public spaces) as well as closure of selected locations. We further tested the selective opening of these locations. Figure 9 shows exemplary results for closures at 200h (ca. 8 days) and openings at 500h (ca. 20 days) with 100 simulations per scenario. It can be observed that closing of all locations leads to a significant reduction of the infection peak from about 8500 individuals to about 1700 individuals.

Thus, closing all locations (except for home and hospital) has a strong advantage compared to closing only selected locations. Reopening of any selected location type such as schools ( Figure 9D ), work ( Figure 9E ), or all locations ( Figure 9F ) results in a unique phenomenon, namely a bimodal behavior of the system. In this case, the infection declines in some simulations, while reaching a strong second peak of infection in other simulations. This is due to the stochastic nature of the process: the precise behavior of individuals is unpredictable, despite being regulated (even in Germany). The ratio of cases of declining and recurring infection waves varies between the scenarios, as well as the peak of the second infection wave with the strongest peak when all public activities are resumed in the scenario \"close all, reopen all\" ( Figure 9F ).

It is based on location data and household numbers of a small German municipality but can be readily extended to any community world-wide where data is available. It neither repeats the history in that municipality nor violates the privacy of real individuals, but it relies on realistic assumptions about type and number of locations, distances, number of households and inhabitants as well as their daily routines. It represents a realistic network between the simulated individuals, hence is not entirely random, despite its inherent stochastic nature. The agent-based model can simulate the stochasticity of virus spreading through a population. Furthermore, its agents are generated based on population data and renders their movements in a realistic environment constructed from real world geodata. Agents have individual behavior based on their age group and encounter other agents by modelled probabilities. This is a significant improvement compared to the classical SIR-models, which are based on ODEs and can, therefore, not simulate individual behavior and randomness nor make use of geolocations. The latter also being an important milestone also for future integration with public health authority recommended smart-phone tracking. Whilst the model recently published by Kissler et al.

The infection probability (whether an S-agent gets infected by an I-agent when meeting at the same location) by itself is hard to measure directly (as statistics over infection events are lacking). Thus, the respective values is best educated guess and we will test the effect of this parameter further with sensitivity analysis.

In forthcoming versions of the model we will allow for more diverse and adapted schedules. First, we will include nursery/senior homes to account for a location with potentially drastic consequences during the pandemic. Then we will also take into account daily occupations such as kindergartens, differentiate between elementary schools and high schools, but also enclose universities and other educational instances.

A ) For state transitions in the model, we consider a transition from susceptible (S) to infected (I), based on interaction between (S) and (I). Infected individuals comprise those not diagnosed (I in full circle) and those diagnosed (I d ), hospitalized (I d H ) and those in ICU (I d ICU ). All infected individuals have a probability of dying (D), patients from the ICU can return to the hospital (non-ICU or recovery ward), and all infected except ICU patients can recover (R). The colors correspond to the colors used below in time course plots.

C ) Schematic representation of infection spreading via interactions at locations over time. At time t , a susceptible and an infected agent move to a location, specified by their respective schedules. They encounter each other at time t+1 and the infection can occur; subsequently they move to other scheduled locations, where they may spread the infection further. D ) Overview of different schedules. Agents with states (S), (R) and (I) follow their regular schedules, which are modulated by the restrictions imposed by mitigation-measures. Upon lifting of these measures, the schedules are reset to their original state. Diagnosed, deceased and hospitalized agents follow specific schedules.",
