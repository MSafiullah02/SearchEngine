The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens, such as viruses, as potentially key contributors to MS induction. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well-studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry occurs when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross-react with self-epitopes, leading to autoimmune tissue destruction.

This appears to be important for disease induction, whereas fidelity between the primary MHC contact residues was variable. Disease was induced by all mimics in dTgH2A neg mice, with the exception of HI and MBT. Similar to MBP 85-99 -induced EAE, the mice exhibited a monophasic disease, although the clinical severity was milder. In dTgH2A pos mice, all mimics, including HI, induced R-EAE; however, HI disease was extremely mild (62) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "(62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 331, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Molecular mimicry in a humanized mouse model"}, {"text": "We examined the infiltrate in the brains and spinal cords of infected mice.

The degree of infiltration correlated with disease; mice primed with the HI mimic peptide (in the dTgH2A neg) did not have any infiltration in either the cerebellum or lower lumbar spinal cord. There was a slight difference between strains, in that more F4 \u2044 80 + infiltrates were found in the cerebellum of dTgH2A pos compared to dTgH2A neg (62) .

In both strains, the greatest response was seen when naive T cells were cultured with MBP 85-99; however, both naive and primed T cells proliferated (cross-reacted) with all mimics. Cytokine production, however, was not consistent with proliferation. While low levels of IFN-c, IL-17, and IL-2 were seen with most mimics, SAU induced large amounts of IFN-c (even from naive T cells) and high levels of IL-17 (in primed dTgH2A neg T cells). MBT also skewed toward a Th1 response with production of IFN-c in naive dTgH2A neg T cells (62) .

Given the wide genetic diversity of individuals displaying a particular autoimmune disease, it is highly unlikely that any one infectious agent will be found to be exclusively associated with a disease. Depending on the genetics of the individual, it is possible that an autoimmune disease could be triggered by a variety of infectious agents contingent on many variables. These variables could include the number of potential crossreactive epitopes encoded by the pathogen, the ability of the infectious agent to activate the innate immune system via stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs, the cellular \u2044 tissue tropism of the agent, the route of infection, and the age and immune repertoire of the affected individual at the time of infection. Significantly, progression of mimicryinduced autoimmune disease can be mediated by additional mechanisms, including epitope spreading, thus these two potential mechanisms for initiation of infection-induced autoimmune disease are not mutually exclusive.

T-cell responses 'spread' from virus-specific to self-specific after continuous inflammation in a chronic virus setting. As tissue is destroyed, self-epitopes are released and present to T cells by APCs, which can mediate further damage to the tissue. Upon further tissue destruction, increasing self-epitopes are released and can be presented and activate naive autoreactive T cells. (C). Molecular mimicry. Tissue damage is mediated by autoreactive T cells that become activated after cross-reacting with viral epitopes presented by APCs.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Amino acid sequences of MBP 85-99 and its bacterial mimics Peptide source (abbreviation) Amino acid residue \u2044 sequence", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
