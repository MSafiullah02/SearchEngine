Although NPAs may be the most sensitive specimens, especially when conventional diagnostic methods such as immunofluorescence or culture are used [3], obtaining an NPA is more difficult than obtaining a swab, and collecting NPAs in an outpatient or field setting may not always be feasible [4], [5]. Molecular methods like reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are becoming widely used for identification of respiratory etiologies [6]. Because molecular tests are more sensitive than conventional methods, less invasive specimen collection techniques than NPA may now approach comparable yields [5], [7].",

After swabbing, the swab applicator was cut off, and each absorbent swab was placed into a vial containing 1 mL of viral transport media (VTM). VTM was prepared at the KEMRI/CDC-K laboratory using standard WHO protocol [10].

One step qRT-PCR was performed by using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA). NP and OP specimens from each patient were separately tested by singleplex qRT-PCR for eight viral pathogens: adenovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1\u20133, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The primers, probes and positive controls for all viruses were provided by CDC-Atlanta. Sequences for the primers and probes are shown in Table 2\n[11]. We tested for influenza A virus with the conserved matrix gene-base qRT-PCR; positive influenza A samples were also subtyped as 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (2009 H1N1), influenza A (H3N2) virus (H3N2), and seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1) [12]. Fluorescence was read at the combined annealing-extension step at 57\u00b0C and recorded as threshold cycle (Ct) values. A Ct value \u226439.9 was regarded as positive; Ct values \u226540.0 were regarded as negative. The qRT-PCR test did not discriminate between viral mRNA and genomic RNA. Specimens were not tested if the following conditions existed when the specimen arrived at the lab: there was no swab, the volume was less than 600 \u00b5L, the specimen was at room temperature, patient identification was absent or inadequate, or the patient questionnaire was absent. In addition, the test results were discarded for any specimen whose internal control (human ribonuclease P gene) was negative.",

This difference may reflect the fact that the major site of initial replication of adenoviruses is the non-ciliated respiratory epithelium of the oropharynx [14]. The kappa value between NP and OP swabs for adenovirus was low (\u03ba = 0.33). This result is consistent with findings of Lambert et al., in which adenovirus accounted for the highest proportion of discordant paired NPA and nasal-throat swab specimens from children [7]. Adenoviruses include over 50 serotypes, and the low concordance between NP and OP specimens for these viruses may reflect different cell tropisms of the adenovirus serotypes for different parts of the respiratory tract [15]. Although we did not conduct serotyping, future studies that evaluate specimen performance for specific adenovirus serotypes could test this hypothesis.",

The sensitivities of NP and OP swabs for unsubtypable influenza A viruses were low, and the strength of agreement between the two swabs was poor. However, unsubtypable influenza A viruses were likely a mix of 2009 H1N1, seasonal H1N1, and H3N2 viruses, making it difficult to interpret this finding. Because half the influenza A specimens were 2009 H1N1, the overall influenza A results were biased towards the 2009 H1N1 findings. Previous studies evaluating NP and OP swabs in detecting influenza viruses found NP swabs to be more sensitive than OP swabs, but these studies used combined outcomes for influenza A and B viruses and did not analyze by influenza A subtypes [6], [16], [17]. The difference in sensitivities of the two swabs in our study may reflect different affinities of influenza types and subtypes for different locations in the respiratory tract. While all influenza viruses infect the respiratory epithelium from the nasopharynx to the bronchioles, 2009 H1N1 virus (and H5N1 virus, which we did not find in our study) can infect lower parts of the respiratory tract, including the alveoli, more commonly than seasonal influenza [18]. This difference could account for the better sensitivity of OP swabs, which reach deeper into the respiratory tract than NP swabs, for 2009 H1N1 virus. Of note, OP swabs have been shown to have superior yield over NP swabs for human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) [19], [20].",

First, we compared only NP and OP swabs; although many routine surveillance systems for influenza and respiratory diseases collect NP and/or OP swabs, other surveillance systems collect NPAs, NP washes, or nasal swabs [22]. While recent studies have used PCR to compare the relative yield of NPAs with those of nose-throat swabs or nasal swabs for respiratory viruses, no studies have evaluated more than three sampling techniques [5], [7], [23], [24]. Head-to-head studies in the future comparing NP swab, OP swab, NPA, NP wash, nose-throat swab, nasal swab, and nasal wash specimen types would provide important information for decisions about which specimens to use for respiratory disease surveillance systems. Second, the NP and OP swabs consisted of different kinds of swab material and used different designs. We used conventional polyester swabs for sampling the nasopharynx and flocked nylon swabs for the oropharynx. Although flocked swabs are superior to conventional swabs for cell recovery, a study comparing different swab material and design (rayon versus nylon flocked swabs) in both the nasopharynx and oropharynx found that the difference in the cycle threshold values between sampling sites was much greater than the difference between swab material and design [25]. Because neither specimen type was consistently more sensitive than the other, we think it is unlikely that the difference in swab material and design substantially affected our results. Additionally, while we tested for eight viruses, we did not include some common viruses, such as coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, and we did not test for bacteria. Finally, the number of adults (n = 85) in this study was relatively small, accounting for just 3.6% of all patients, and as a result there was limited power to compare the sensitivities of NP and OP swabs for specific viruses in this population.",

Neither specimen was consistently more sensitive than the other. Collecting both swabs had a complementary effect; even when there was higher sensitivity for one technique over the other, the lower-sensitivity technique still identified a considerable number of cases not identified by the higher-sensitivity one. For respiratory disease surveillance programs using qRT-PCR that aim to maximize sensitivity for a large number of viruses, collecting combined NP and OP specimens would be the ideal approach. However, the enhanced sensitivity of using both swabs comes at a higher cost; this includes not only the expense of the second swab, but further patient discomfort as well as additional time and effort from the person taking the sample. Thus, for surveillance systems with limited resources, a single-swab approach, whether NP or OP, would be the most logistically simple and maintain moderate sensitivity for many of the pathogens we tested in our study.",
