All other biological tests including the dosage of hepatic, muscular and cardiac enzymes were normal on admission. Chest X-Ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and bilateral pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal and homogeneous left ventricular contractility with low filling pressures, with an aortic Velocity Time Integral (VTI) of 10 cm (normal: 18\u201325 cm), a normal right heart function with Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) at 14 mm (normal: 15\u201320 mm), and a small pericardial effusion.

Chest computed tomography showed vessels enlargement, peribronchial cuffing, bilateral Kerley lines, alveolar edema, and abundant right pleural effusion needing pleural drainage. The protein level in the pleural fluid was 43 g/l and the microbiological culture was sterile. The viral investigations (IgM and RT-PCR in the blood) confirmed an acute infection by Hantavirus. The complete RNA coding sequence of the S RNA segment (GenBank accession no. MG785209) was also generated and compared with those of the other 5 previous hantavirus cases from French Guiana using a Bayesian approach. This S RNA sequences showed a nucleotide identity of 95.9 to 99.5% with the five other previously described sequences of the Maripa virus belonging to the Rio Mamor\u00e9 clade. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from alignment with 1308 nt of the S segment [4]. Laboratory testing concerning other infectious agents (bacteria, fungal or parasite) were negative.",

The mechanism which may explain the severity of the disease is the tropism of hantavirus for the microvascular endothelial cell [5]. This tropism causes microvascular hyperpermeability with fluid and proteins leakage leading to hypovolemia and to a non cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Biologically, we observe an increased haematocrit level due to hemoconcentration, and a paradoxical reduced serum proteins level secondary to the transfer of proteins from the vessel to the interstitial space.",

Disruption of cell junctions, with combination of cell retraction process, lead to the loss of the vascular endothelium barrier function. In such conditions, fluids and proteins infusion are ineffective because of the immediate leakage to the interstitial space with a worsening of the respiratory failure without any efficacy on the hemodynamic state. This mechanism is similar to that reported by Clarkson in 1960 and is explained by a plasma leakage [6] which was also described in arbovirus infections where the diagnosis was based on thoraco-abdominal sonography and scanography [7\u20139].",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of capillary leakage remains undefined. Some evidence suggest that hantavirus disease pathogenesis is immunologically mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and other immune cells in target organs producing inflammatory cytokines. Overall, three hypotheses have been reported to explain the mechanism of increased capillary permeability involved in hantavirus infection: a) the attack of infected endothelial cells by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), b) TNF-\u03b1 production by infected monocyte/macrophages and finally c) the direct effect of the virus on the endothelial cell functions [5, 10]. Bradykinin, a potent inflammatory and vasoactive nonapeptide generated by kallikrein at the sites of tissue injury is supposed to be the key mediator of the vascular leakage resulting from hantavirus infection. It acts by disrupting inter-endothelial junctions and causes changes in vascular tone. Two patients with severe capillary leak syndrome caused by a Puumala hantavirus infection were successfully treated with a bradykinin receptor antagonist [11, 12]. Experimental data demonstrating the plasma kallikrein-kinin system activation during hantavirus infection were also reported [13]. In the same way, the intensity of the inflammatory syndrome was correlated to the importance of the capillary leakage and to the level of thrombocytopenia [14].",

Many studies assume that the shock associated to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is cardiogenic and hantavirus induces a typical myocarditis. These data were based on the examination of postmortem tissue from human HPS cases [15]. However, in our case, myocardial dysfunction was neither observed during echocardiography and nor during PICCO investigation. Any inotropic agent support has been needed. In addition, Troponine levels were normal despite severe shock. Consequently, we think that Maripa virus is more responsible for HPS rather than HCPS. Such a finding is important as it raises the question about the effectiveness of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients presenting Maripa Virus infection with severe shock.",
