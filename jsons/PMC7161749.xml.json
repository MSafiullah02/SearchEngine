            "text": "Enzymes play important roles in several biological processes including digestion, absorption, metabolism, and propagation. Their functions are essential for all living organisms and are closely associated with many pathogenic mechanisms. Enzyme inhibitors or activators therefore represent important molecular targets for the development of new disease treatments. Among enzymes, proteases are important molecular targets because their substrates are proteins, proteases, and peptides, which play crucial roles in all forms of life\u2014from viruses to humans. Proteases are categorized into four major classes: aspartic proteases, serine proteases, cysteine proteases, and metalloproteases, which contain aspartic acid, serine, cysteine, and metallic ions, respectively, in their active sites. Renin was the first protease for which inhibitors were designed logically, using a computational approach (structure\u2010based drug design; SBDD). Renin is an aspartic protease that is involved in the rate\u2010limiting first step of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) and is a molecular target for antihypertensive agents.1, 2, 3 Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to release the decapeptide angiotensin I as shown in Figure 1A. Angiotensin I is subsequently cleaved by a nonspecific dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE), to release the potent octapeptide vasopressor angiotensin II. The pepsin inhibitor pepstatin A, which features the \u03b3\u2010amino acid statine as the transition state analogue, was reported to inhibit the activity of renin, and since then, many renin inhibitors containing a transition state analogue have been developed.1 Boger et al. designed a renin inhibitor, called statine\u2010containing renin inhibitory peptide (SCRIP; half\u2010maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 16 nM; Figure 1B), that had a statine residue at the P1 position and contained a part of the angiotensinogen amino acid sequence.2 We also designed and synthesized the potent, small inhibitor, KRI\u20101314 (IC50 = 2.4 nM), that contains a norstatine\u2010type residue as a transition state analogue.3 The first renin inhibitor drug, aliskiren (IC50 = 0.6 nM; Novartis and Speedel), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007.",

BPP5a was found in the venom of the snake Bothrops jararaca and inhibits ACE activity.4 The first ACE inhibitor drug, captopril, was approved by the FDA in 1981 and was designed to emulate the C\u2010terminus Ala\u2010Pro sequence of BPP5a.5 The proline residue of captopril docks in the S2 pocket of ACE, and another residue docks in the S1 pocket. The coordination bond that is formed between the sulfur atom of captopril and the zinc ion in the active site of ACE appears to contribute to the potent inhibition.",

HIV\u20101 protease is also an aspartic protease, and its inhibitors can be designed using an approach similar to that used for the design of renin inhibitors. HIV\u20101 protease is responsible for processing the Gag and Gag\u2010Pol polyproteins and enabling the proliferation of the retrovirus. The first HIV\u20101 protease inhibitor approved by the FDA, saquinavir (Figure 2), was developed using a computational approach. Many HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors, i.e., saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, atazanavir, and darunavir, possess a hydroxyethylamine moiety that acts as a transition state analogue, whereas ritonavir and lopinavir possess a hydroxyethylene moiety as a transition state analogue. The use of these HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has contributed considerably to overcoming AIDS.6 All HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors have a hydroxyl group in the transition state analogue residue and can strongly bind to the active site of the HIV\u20101 protease.",

First, a water molecule is deprotonated by the carboxyl anion of one of the aspartic acid side chains; the resulting hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate at the cleavage site to form a tetrahedral transition state as shown in Figure 3. Rearrangement of this transition state causes the amide bond in the substrate to be broken. Although serine and cysteine proteases cleave peptide bonds via a transition state consisting of a covalent bond between the catalytic serine/cysteine and carbonyl carbon at the cleavage position of the substrate, aspartic proteases form a transition state based on noncovalent interactions between their carboxylic acid/carboxylate groups and the two hydroxyl groups of the substrate. The fact that the transition state in aspartic proteases involves no covalent bond formation makes the tetrahedral structures in the transition state relatively simple. This makes it possible to design aspartic protease inhibitors logically using a computational approach.",

Next, \u03b3\u2010secretase cleaves between either the Val and Ile, or the Ala and Thr residues in the C\u2010terminus of the A\u03b2 domain to form either A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively (Figure 5). A\u03b242 shows greater neurotoxicity and aggregability than A\u03b240 and appears to be a key biomolecular marker of AD pathogenesis. Based on the amyloid hypothesis, many inhibitors against \u03b2\u2010 or \u03b3\u2010secretases have been designed and synthesized as drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The fact that \u03b2\u2010secretase\u2010knockout transgenic mice live normally suggests that \u03b2\u2010secretase is a promising molecular target for AD drug development.23 Most \u03b2\u2010secretase inhibitors possess a transition state analogue at the P1 position and are designed based on the amino acid sequence of Swedish mutant APP, which has a double mutation around the \u03b2\u2010site (at the K670N and M671L residues). Inhibition of the \u03b2\u2010cleavage of the Swedish mutation of APP by \u03b2\u2010secretase is important because this increases the levels of A\u03b242 and A\u03b240. Many APP mutations from AD patients have been reported, and these mutations accelerate A\u03b2s levels or A\u03b2s aggregabilities. Recently, a mutation on the \u03b2\u2010site of APP\u2014Ala(673)Thr\u2014has been reported. This mutation was identified from a set of whole\u2010genome sequence data of 1795 Icelandic people as a gene with a low risk of AD and protects against AD and age\u2010related decline. This finding appears to verify the validity of the amyloid hypothesis in the AD pathology.10\n",

The X\u2010ray crystal structure of the NS3\u2010telaprevir complex (PDB ID: 3SV6) is shown in Figure 10A. As expected, it is shown that the inhibitor's carbonyl carbon binds to the Ser139 side chain via a covalent bond, and the carbonyl carbon forms a tetrahedral structure.

There are two main incretin hormones: glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 (GLP\u20101) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP, also known as glucose\u2010dependent insulinotropic peptide).101, 102, 103, 104, 105 Because these hormones are rapidly cleaved and inactivated by the serine protease DPP\u20104, its inhibitor is expected to be a drug candidate for type 2 diabetes treatment.106, 107 DPP\u20104 recognizes the N\u2010terminal Xaa\u2010Pro residue of peptides, leading to the release of dipeptide Xaa\u2010Pro. Since DPP\u20104 also recognizes the Xaa\u2010Ala sequence, DPP\u20104 cleaves the N\u2010terminus of GLP\u20101 and GIP\u2014the N\u2010terminal dipeptides being His\u2010Ala and Tyr\u2010Ala, respectively. Because Xaa\u2010Ala residues were thought to exist at the N\u2010terminus of many proteins/peptides, DPP\u20104 inhibitors were predicted to have many side effects. Additionally, it is known that the DPP family consists of nine enzymes. Among them, DPP\u20108 and DPP\u20109 have a similar structure and selectivity to DPP\u20104. Indeed, Lankas et al. reported some toxicities by the DPP\u20108/\u20109 inhibition of nonselective DPP\u20104 inhibitors\u2014in rats, alopecia, thrombocytopenia, reticulocytopenia, enlarged spleen, multiorgan histopathological changes, and mortality, and in dogs, gastrointestinal toxicity.108 A DPP\u20104 inhibitor for use as an antidiabetes drug therefore needs to be highly specific. Most DPP\u20104 inhibitors were designed based on the Phe\u2010Pro sequence of the substrate. The first DPP\u20104 inhibitor 33 (sitagliptin, Figure 11) was developed by MSD and approved as an oral antidiabetes drug by the FDA in 2006. Sitagliptin has a \u03b2\u2010amino acid unit and a unique cyclic amine corresponding to the Phe and Pro residues, respectively.109 Inhibitors 34 (vidagliptin), 35 (anagliptin), and 36 (alogliptin) possess a cyanopyrrolidine group corresponding to the Pro residue and were developed by Novaltis, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, respectively.110, 111, 112 Anagliptin was approved for use in Japan. The cyanopyrrolidine inhibitors are apparently designed based on the covalent bond formation between the cyano\u2010carbon of the inhibitor and catalytic Ser630 side chain of the enzyme. However, alogliptin shows no covalent bonding with the Ser630 side chain in the X\u2010ray crystal structure of the complex with the DPP\u20104 enzyme (PDB ID: 2ONC) as shown in Figure 11. The cyano group interacts with the Arg125 side chain of the enzyme, and the catalytic Ser635 side chain does not interact with alogliptin; instead, the binding relies on the docking of the inhibitor's phenyl ring into the hydrophobic S1 pocket, the ionic bonding of inhibitor's amino group with Glu205 and Glu206 side chains, and the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction between the inhibitor's quinazolinone ring and the Tyr547 side chain appear to allow a potent binding mode. Linagliptin developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly was approved by the FDA in 2011. Linagliptin possesses no cyano group. The amino group, the unsaturated alkyl group, and the uracil ring of linagliptin interact with the Glu205 and Glu206 side chains, the S1 pocket, and the Tyr547 side chain via ionic bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, respectively, as well as that of alogliptin.",

            "text": "Aspartic protease inhibitors can be easily designed using a computational approach such as a docking simulation, in silico screening, or in silico de novo design because aspartic proteases form a tetrahedral substrate transition state that is relatively simple since it contains no covalent bonds between the enzyme and the substrate. On the other hand, cysteine/serine proteases form a covalent bond with the substrate in the transition state. It is therefore difficult to rationally design a transition state analogue inhibitor of cysteine/serine proteases using a docking simulation, because of the van der Waals repulsion that is generated between the inhibitor and the catalytic amino acid side chain. In the case of the metalloprotease ACE, inhibitor development had to wait until the discovery of a peptide in snake venom, and until then, the design of an inhibitor using a computational approach seemed impossible. In the case of the serine protease hepatitis C virus NS3 protease, \u03b1\u2010ketocarboxamide inhibitors such as 27 and 28 were developed at an early stage. These inhibitors formed covalent bonds with the enzyme as shown in Figure 10A. Covalent inhibitors with a ketone or aldehyde group are generally unstable against nucleophilic agents or enzymes in vivo. Next, noncovalent inhibitors 29\u201032, which feature a cyclopropanesulfonylamide group, were reported. Although the inhibitor's sulfonyl oxygen atom interacts with the catalytic Ser side chain by hydrogen bonding (as shown in Figure 10B), the attractive force is weaker than that of a transition state inhibitor. These inhibitors showed potent inhibitory activities by elongation in the direction of S2 sites. Compounds 30\u201332 were cyclized to fix their conformation when docked in the active site of the enzyme. Another group of serine proteases, the DPP\u20104 protease inhibitors 34\u201336, were designed in anticipation of the covalent bond formed between the inhibitor's cyano carbon and the catalytic Ser side chain. However, the X\u2010ray crystal structure of the NS3 protease complex with 36 shows no covalent bond between the enzyme and the inhibitor as shown in Figure 12. As mentioned previously, it is difficult to rationally design metallo\u2010, serine, and cysteine proteases based purely on the knowledge of the amino acid sequence of their substrate. Inhibitors such as ACE, HCV NS3 protease, and DPP\u20104 were developed using unique design concepts and bind to the catalytic side chain of the enzyme in a unique manner. In contrast, aspartic protease inhibitors can be designed logically based on the amino acid sequences of substrates. Many aspartic protease inhibitors have a transition state analogue at the P1 position, and their structures are simple. Recently, we determined the whole structure of the complex formed between the HIV\u20101 protease and KNI\u2010272, which contains the location of protons, as shown in Figure 12.114 Although protons cannot be directly observed using conventional X\u2010ray crystallography, the successful determination of all coordinates was achieved, for the first time, using high\u2010resolution X\u2010ray (at 1.4 \u00c5) and neuron (at 1.9 \u00c5) crystallography. As shown in Figure 3, in the cleavage mechanism of aspartic proteases, a carboxylic acid proton and a carboxyl anion in the active site of the enzyme interact with the substrate transition state via two hydrogen bonds. The transition state analogue of KNI\u2010272 interacts with a carboxylic acid proton and a carboxyl anion in the same manner and accurately mimics the substrate transition state. Transition state analogue inhibitors allow potent inhibition of enzyme activity because the transition state analogue can bind strongly to the active site of the enzyme and is not cleaved enzymatically.",
