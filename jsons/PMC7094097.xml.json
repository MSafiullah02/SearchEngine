            "text": "The number of biological sequences is rapidly increasing in the biological database. It is one of the challenges for bio-scientists to analyze mathematically the large volume of biological sequence data. It is good to use the graphic representation to study complicated biological systems because it can provide an intuitive picture and help people gain useful insights. Similar graphical approaches have also been used to deal with a wide variety of biological problems. For instance, various graphic approaches have been successfully used to study enzyme-catalyzed system (see, e.g., King and Altman, 1956, Chou et al., 1979, Chou and Forsen, 1980, Chou and Liu, 1981, Zhou and Deng, 1984, Chou, 1989, Chou, 1990; Kuzmic et al., 1992, Lin and Neet, 1990), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990, Chou, 1993), condon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992, Zhang and Chou, 1994), HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition mechanisms (Althaus et al., 1993a, Althaus et al., 1993b, Althaus et al., 1993c) and base frequency distribution in the anti-sense strands (Chou and Zhang, 1996). Recently, the images of cellular automata were also used to represent biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a), predict protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a), investigate HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b) and HBV viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006b), as well as analyze the fingerprint of SARS coronavirus (Wang et al., 2005).",

Some of them, for example Nandy\u2019 graphical representation (Nandy, 1994), are accompanied by some loss of visual information associated with crossing and overlapping of the curve with itself. In order to avoid the limitations related to crossing and overlapping, Liao (Liao and Wang, 2004) and Randic (Randic and Vracko, 2000, Randic et al., 2003) present their 2D or 3D graphical representations. However, their approaches are associated with the computations of D/D, L/L and leading eigenvalue, which need a great deal of running time and memory space.",

Our representation is different from that of PN-curve (Qi and Fan, 2007). The two papers are highly dissimilar with respect to each other in many aspects: the methods and contents of research, the map used to construct graphical representation, the graphical curve and numerical invariants characterizing DNA sequences. The introduced representation is simple and direct, and gives us more biology information based on DNs.",

            "text": "Given a DNA primary sequence, there are 16 kinds of the pairs of the neighboring nucleotides. These pairs can be classified as four categories based on their chemical properties: purine-DN {AG, GA}/pyrimidine-DN {CT, TC}, amino-DN {AC, CA}/keto-DN {GT, TG}, weak-H bond DN {AT, TA}/strong-H bond DN {CG, GC} and repeat-DN {AA, CC, GG, TT}. Then we design a 4\u00d74 matrix and give a new 3D graphical representation of DNA sequences. We arrange 16 DNs in a 4\u00d74 matrix according to the above four categories. The matrix is AGGACTTCACCAGTTGATTACGGCAACCGGTT.Every element of the matrix has a corresponding index (i,j), i=0,1,2,3; j=0,1,2,3. Based on the index, we assign one DN as follows:(0,0,0)\u2192AG,(0,1,0)\u2192GA,(0,2,0)\u2192CT,(0,3,0)\u2192TC,(1,0,0)\u2192AC,(1,1,0)\u2192CA,(1,2,0)\u2192GT,(1,3,0)\u2192TG,(2,0,0)\u2192AT,(2,1,0)\u2192TA,(2,2,0)\u2192CG,(2,3,0)\u2192GC,(3,0,0)\u2192AA,(3,1,0)\u2192CC,(3,2,0)\u2192GG,(3,3,0)\u2192TT.That is to say, we assign every DN to its corresponding index (x,y), respectively, while the corresponding curve extending along with z-axes. In detail, let G=g1g2\u2026 be an arbitrary DNA primary sequence. Then we define a map \u03c6 as follows: \u03c6(gigi+1)=(0,0,i)ifgigi+1=AG,(0,1,i)ifgigi+1=GA,(0,2,i)ifgigi+1=CT,(0,3,i)ifgigi+1=TC,(1,0,i)ifgigi+1=AC,(1,1,i)ifgigi+1=CA,(1,2,i)ifgigi+1=GT,(1,3,i)ifgigi+1=TG,(2,0,i)ifgigi+1=AT,(2,1,i)ifgigi+1=TA,(2,2,i)ifgigi+1=CG,(2,3,i)ifgigi+1=GC,(3,0,i)ifgigi+1=AA,(3,1,i)ifgigi+1=CC,(3,2,i)ifgigi+1=GG,(3,3,i)ifgigi+1=TT.The map \u03c6 maps G into a plot set. For example, the corresponding plot set of the sequence ATGGTGCACC is {(2, 0, 1), (1, 3, 2), (3, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (1, 1, 7), (1, 0, 8), (3, 1, 9)}. The corresponding plot set is called as characteristic plot set. The curve connected all plots of the characteristic plot set in turn is called 3D-DN curve. In Table 1\nand Fig. 1\n, we show the corresponding coordinates and the 3D graphical representation of the sequence, respectively.",

Based on the definition of the map \u03c6, we can have a set of points (xi,yi,zi), i=1,2,\u2026,N-1, and the correspondence between the DNs and the points is one-to-one. In order to find some of the invariants sensitive to the form of the characteristic curve we will transform the 3D graphical representation of the characteristic curve into another mathematical object. Firstly, let Kab denote the total number of the DN ab appearing in the given sequence, a\u2208{A,C,G,T}, b\u2208{A,C,G,T}. The vertex (dot) V1 denotes the first dot (x1,y1,z1) of the 3D-DN curve. The vertex (dot) Vi denotes the ith dot (xi,yi,zi) of the 3D-DN curve. Then let dab denote the sum of geometrical lengths of edges between vertices (dots) V1 and Vab of the 3D-DN curve, where Vab denotes the vertex representing the DN ab appearing in the given sequence. The parameter pab is defined as the distribution of DN ab frequency. For 3D-DN curve, after simple computation, we can obtain d\u00afab=\u2211k=1Kabdkab/Kab, pab=Kab/(N-1), where dkab denotes the sum of geometrical lengths of edges between vertices (dots) V1 and Vab of the 3D-DN curve when the DN ab appears kth time in the given sequence. Here, we calculate the (d\u00af,p)-Matrix as the following: (d\u00af,p)-M=(d\u00afAG,pAG)(d\u00afGA,pGA)(d\u00afCT,pCT)(d\u00afTC,pTC)(d\u00afAC,pAC)(d\u00afCA,pCA)(d\u00afGT,pGT)(d\u00afTG,pTG)(d\u00afAT,pAT)(d\u00afTA,pTA)(d\u00afCG,pCG)(d\u00afGC,pGC)(d\u00afAA,pAA)(d\u00afCC,pCC)(d\u00afGG,pGG)(d\u00afTT,pTT).The direct biological meaning of the (d\u00af,p)-Matrix is that they indicate the mean spaces and the distributions of DNs in the graph of the given sequence, respectively. Here, we regard them as the invariants to numerically characterize the DNA sequences.",

The ordering of the nucleic bases in our matrix is not important. But we want to know whether the ordering of the DNs of the matrix brings about divergent trends in computing parameters to determine similarity/dissimilarity between two DNA sequences. So we randomly arrange 16 DNs in another 4\u00d74 matrix M\u2032 as follows: GCGGGTTCTTCAATAACTTACGAGTGCCGAAC.Every element of the matrix has a corresponding index (i,j), i=0,1,2,3; j=0,1,2,3. Based on the index, we assign one DN as follows:(0,0,0)\u2192GC,(0,1,0)\u2192GG,(0,2,0)\u2192GT,(0,3,0)\u2192TC,(1,0,0)\u2192TT,(1,1,0)\u2192CA,(1,2,0)\u2192AT,(1,3,0)\u2192AA,(2,0,0)\u2192CT,(2,1,0)\u2192TA,(2,2,0)\u2192CG,(2,3,0)\u2192AG,(3,0,0)\u2192TG,(3,1,0)\u2192CC,(3,2,0)\u2192GA,(3,3,0)\u2192AC.Based on the above designation we can draw another 3D-DN curve to represent the same DNA sequence, which is named as C\u2032.",

According to the results of the examination of Fig. 4 we can draw a conclusion that there exit the same trends in computing parameters to determine similarity/dissimilarity between two DNA sequences by using the s-vectors derived from different 3D-DN curves.

The properties of DNs in a DNA sequence based on the 4\u00d74 matrix consisting of 16 DNs are presented in the 3D graphical representation. Based on this representation, we construct two 16-component vectors and employ the vectors in characterizing and comparing the complete coding sequence part of beta globin gene of nine different species. The results of examination show that our method is useful for visualizing the local and global features of long or short DNA sequences and can reveal the visual characteristic in a DNA sequence. The advantage of our approach is that it allows visual inspection of DNs data, helping in recognizing major similarities among different DNA sequences.",
