Genotype C and T were first suggested at the end of May 2003 (Li et al., 2003), and were further improved and named as the Yexin genotype and Xiaohong genotype (Wang et al., 2004). SARS virus was supposed to be transmitted from the wild animal to human being. This hypothesis was then supported by identification of a SARS-CoV-like virus in wild animals, such as palm civet, sold in markets in south China, for it had more than 99% of sequence identity to the SARS-CoV (Guan et al., 2003), and indicating that the virus could have recently transferred its hosts, from animals to human beings. However, recent reports indicated that SARS-CoV was distinct from the virus in palm civet and no direct evidence so far to demonstrate if the palm civet virus was the origin of the SARS-CoV or if palm civets were also infected from other species (Stadler et al., 2003). Although unlikely, the possibility that humans infected these SARS-CoV positive animals cannot be formally excluded, and there was a report of SARS-CoV transmitted from human to pig (Chen et al., 2005). Where is the SARS-CoV-like virus of palm civet in the chain? Are they getting it from another animal? Are palm civets infecting rodents as well as humans? These still are not known exactly.",
