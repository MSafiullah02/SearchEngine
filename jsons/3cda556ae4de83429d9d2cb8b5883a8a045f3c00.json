Bronchus at all levels and pulmonary alveoli were also damaged by this virus. Interstitial alveolar edema and congestion occurred. And a large number of inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and lymphocytes, infiltrated. One of the most important pathological changes was the mechanization of alveolar exudate and the fibrosis of the interstitial lung. Pulmonary fibrosis was closely related to tissue inflammation and damage repair [8] . In this study, we discovered that fibrosis indicators had obvious advantages in predicting the severity and prognosis of patients, which was rarely seen in previous reports. Hyaluronic acid, laminin and collagen were the main components of the extracellular matrix in the lung, which were also the indicators reported a lot in fibrosis studies [8, 9] . These matrix components made the lung tissue a whole, and then performed its physiological function. During the inflammation and repair process, extracellular matrix components were excessively deposited, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation in the end. Previous studies reported that the concentration differences of hyaluronic acid and laminin in both patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF) and rats injected with bleomycin in pulmonary fibrosis model could be observed, suggesting that these indicators can effectively reflect the degree of pulmonary fibrosis [9] . In this study, we discovered that the levels of hyaluronic acid and type III procollagen detected at admission, could clearly distinguish critical patients. The level of laminin differed only between the critical group and the mild group, and there was no statistical difference between the critical group and the severe group. However, no difference of type \u2163 procollagen level was shown among all groups (Figure 1) . Figure 3 shows the transbronchial biopsy pathology and imaging result of a critical patient. We discovered that four indicators, including hyaluronic acid, type III procollagen, type IV procollagen and laminin, were obviously abnormal. CT suggested rapid deterioration. Bronchoscopy biopsy was performed after lung consolidation. It was shown that the inflammation exudates obviously, with alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, interstitial thickening and local formation of granulomatous nodules. And within the nodules were hyperplastic fibroblasts and lymphocytes. This case visually showed the characteristics of imaging changes and pathological changes in critical patients. It might be due to the small sample size of this study, we did not obtain similar type IV procollagen results to that of previous reports [10, 11] . The results obtained in this study were similar to that of previous studies of both clinical observation of IPF and COPD patients and animal models in the laboratory [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 492, "end": 495, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 842, "end": 845, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 846, "end": 848, "text": "9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1440, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2679, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2680, "end": 2683, "text": "11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2855, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1849, "end": 1859, "text": "(Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1862, "end": 1870, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous reports suggested that, the decline in peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as the increase of both peripheral inflammatory factors, such as CRP and IL-6, and lactic acid, can be the early warning indicators of poor prognosis for patients [5~7] . The description in previous literature reports was also consistent with this program. However, there were few reports on the changes of these indicators during the whole process of the disease. Besides, few reports analyzed the relationship between dynamic changes of these indicators and the severity of the disease. In this study, we discovered that lymphocyte count at admission can be used as the indicator to distinguish the severity of the disease, also its change was closely related to the prognosis of the disease (Figure 2, Table 3) . CRP also owned a similar trend to lymphocyte count, suggesting the value of lymphocyte count and CRP in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 2, Table 3 ). Figure 4 shows the dynamic changes in chest CT, lymphocyte count and CRP of a critical patient from admission to discharge. And this provides us an intuitive realization of the relationship between these two indicators and the severity of the disease. It is simple and easy to check both lymphocyte count and CRP. In this way, both of them should be performed as the routine examination on patients with COVID-19. Unlike most previous reports, no statistical differences were shown after comparing all IL-6 levels of patients collected from admission. This might be due to the small sample size ( Table 3 ). In addition, the patients' lactic acid levels were also included in the study. However, not every patient received the blood gas analysis test, and the amount of data was too small.
