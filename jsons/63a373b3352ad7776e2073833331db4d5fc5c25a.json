It is unclear if the existing solid waste management facilities for medical waste can meet the rapid increase in demand, and there is an immediate threat that the pandemic impacts will spill over into a crisis of environmental pollution. 2 Beyond medical facilities, the social distancing policies implemented in response to the pandemic have led to a dramatic surge in demand for face masks and tissue paper throughout the general population. 3 The gap between demand and supply of such products has led to urgent calls for strategies to collect, disinfect, recycle, and reuse masks. 4 However, there are serious potential risks of infection associated with the reuse of face masks because of the wide range expectancy of masks designed to protect against exposure to virus particles. 5 ",

Realtime disinfection of PPE is an ideal solution for the challenge of extending its useful lifetime. The idea is not new, but commercial production has not been viable. We now have the opportunity to re-think investments in research on \"green\" materials that have intrinsic disinfection properties, are long-wearing, and are recyclable. Such materials will save the lives of front-line emergency responders and hospital-based healthcare professionals, while also contributing to when used in concert with policies such as social distancing.",

The research on nanomaterials has produced several commercial products, although concerns have been raised about the environmental impacts of nanoparticles released from consumer products embedded with, for example, nanosilver. 13 Results from a study of face masks embedded with nanosilver particles showed that 100 ppm colloidal silver produced antibacterial activity. 14 The limitations of research results so far accumulated are that the studies are usually based on surrogate pathogens, especially bacteria such as laboratory strains of Escherichia coli. Very few studies of the disinfecting properties of nanoparticles have been conducted with pathogenic viruses, in part because many such viruses are also sized in the nanometer dimension, and the physical dimensions may reduce embedded in materials that must also have 15 The proliferation of medical application of nanosilver has provoked calls for international regulation bases on potential environmental risks associated with their toxicity and discharges in wastewater. 16 However, the concerns about environmental pollution may dissipate with intentional design to make nanoparticle-enhanced PPE that can last longer and is recyclable, thereby reducing the generation of solid waste that requires special management due to risks of infection.",
