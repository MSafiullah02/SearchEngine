            "text": "Factors predicting the onset or severity of ARDS are poorly defined. The relatively low incidence of ARDS in the relatively large group of patients at risk, however, suggests that genetic factors must contribute to the progression of ARDS. Moreover, large individual differences in plasma ACE concentrations have been reported among individuals, whereas the ACE plasma levels tend to be similar within families (Cambien et al. 1988). The human ACE gene (dcp1) is located on chromosome 17q23 and contains a restriction fragment length polymorphism within the coding sequence of intron 16 defined by the presence (insertion, I) or absence (deletion, D) of a 287 bp repeat. This polymorphism determines function, and the human ACE2 D allele confers increased ACE activity (Rigat et al. 1990). Importantly, recent cohort studies in ARDS patients showed a marked correlation between the ACE I/D polymorphism and the susceptibility and mortality of ARDS (Marshall et al. 2002). The D/D genotype was significantly increased in patients with ARDS compared with control patients with non\u2010ARDS respiratory failure ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU), ICU patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and individuals from a general population group. In addition, the ACE D/D allele correlated with mortality in the ARDS group. Another study showed that patients carrying the ACE I/I genotype have a significantly increased survival rate (Jerng et al. 2006). These data implicate genetic factors in susceptibility, progression and lethality of ARDS in human patients.",

            "text": "Our group investigated the role of ACE2 in ALI/ARDS by using ace2 knockout mice. In three different ARDS models (acid aspiration\u2010induced ARDS, endotoxin\u2010induced ARDS and peritoneal sepsis\u2010induced ARDS), ace2 knockout mice show very severe disease compared with wild\u2010type mice (Imai et al. 2005). Loss of ACE2 expression in mutant mice resulted in enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung oedema, neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function. Importantly, treatment with catalytically active recombinant ACE2 protein improved the symptoms of acute lung injury in wild\u2010type mice, as well as in ace2 knockout mice (Imai et al. 2005). Thus, ACE2 plays a protective role in acute lung injury. Mechanistically, the negative regulation of Ang II levels by ACE2 account, in part, for the protective function of ACE2 in ARDS. For example, AT1R inhibitor treatment or additional ace gene deficiency on an ace2 knockout background rescues the severe phenotype of ace2 single\u2010mutant mice in acute lung injury (Imai et al. 2005). In addition, ace knockout mice and at1a receptor knockout mice showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury (Imai et al. 2005). Therefore, in acute lung injury, ACE, Ang II, and AT1R function as lung\u2010injury\u2010promoting factors, while ACE2 protects from lung injury (Fig. 2).",

In these experiments, ACE2 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV infection using the recombinant Spike protein of SARS\u2010CoV (Li et al. 2003). Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 can bind to SARS\u2010CoV Spike, and this binding supports \u2018syncytia formation\u2019, the fusion of Spike protein\u2010expressing cells into large multinucleated cells that can also be observed in clinical SARS infections. Expression of ACE2 in cells that are usually not susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV infection allows entry of live virus into the cell (Li et al. 2003); however, it was unclear whether ACE2 is required for a natural in vivo SARS infection.",

            "text": "Using a SARS infection model in ace2 knockout mice, our group was able to show that ACE2 is indeed essential for SARS infections in vivo (Kuba et al. 2005). When ace2 knockout mice are infected with the SARS coronavirus, they were resistant to virus infection (Kuba et al. 2005). Virus titres from the lung tissues of infected ace2 knockout mice were 105\u2010fold lower than those from the lungs of wild\u2010type mice (Kuba et al. 2005). Moreover, none of lung histology from ace2 knockout mice challenged with SARS coronavirus showed signs of inflammation (Kuba et al. 2005), whereas some (but not all) SARS\u2010infected wild\u2010type mice displayed mild inflammation as defined by leukocyte infiltration (Hogan et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2004; Kuba et al. 2005). Thus, ACE2 is an essential receptor for SARS infections in vivo. One important question in SARS pathology is why infections with the SARS\u2010CoV trigger severe lung disease with such high mortality whereas infections with other coronaviruses result in rather mild disease. In addition, severe SARS infections are determined by the burden of viral replication as well as by the consequences of the host immune response. Our own studies have implicated the renin\u2013angiotensin system in SARS pathogenesis: first, ACE2 is a critical SARS receptor in vivo; and second, ACE2 and other components of the RAS play a central role in controlling the severity of acute lung failure once the disease process has been initiated (Imai et al. 2005; Fig. 2).",

Similarly, treatment with recombinant SARS Spike protein, in the absence of any other virus components, downregulates ACE2 protein expression in cell lines in vitro and in lungs in vivo (Kuba et al. 2005). Thus, SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected or Spike protein\u2010treated wild\u2010type mice resemble ace2 knockout animals. In addition, similar to ace2 mutant mice, Spike\u2010treated wild\u2010type mice show markedly more severe pathology in acute lung injury (Kuba et al. 2005). As a consequence, Ang II peptide levels were increased in Spike\u2010treated mice and these mice showed worsened ARDS symptoms that could be partly reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the AT1R. By contrast, SARS Spike challenge did not affect the ARDS symptoms in ace2 knockout mice (Kuba et al. 2005). Thus, the downregulation of ACE2 expression in SARS\u2010CoV infections might play a causal role in SARS pathogenesis, especially in disease progression to ARDS. These results also provide a rational explanation for the severe disease pathology in SARS patients (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "The pulmonary circulation is a potentially important target for the renin\u2013angiotensin system in the lung. For instance, Ang II via AT1R induces pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia, suggesting important roles of Ang II and AT1R in elevating pulmonary vascular tone that can result in pulmonary oedema (Kiely et al. 1997). Also, infusion of Ang I (Xu et al. 1998) or Ang II (Yamamoto et al. 1997) can produce pulmonary oedema independent of catecholamine release. In addition to increased vascular tone and a subsequent hydrostatic oedema formation, accumulating data suggest that Ang II also increases vascular permeability via AT1 receptors, whereas stimulation of AT2 receptors may exert opposite effects (Victorino et al. 2002). Several mediators have been implicated in Ang II\u2010regulated vascular permeability changes, including the eicosanoids leukotriene C4, prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2, and vascular permeability factor (Suzuki et al. 2003). Few studies have addressed whether the RAS is involved in the increased vascular permeability, one of the hallmarks in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Our study demonstrated that loss of ACE2 expression results in increased vascular permeability using infusion of high\u2010molecular weight dextran or Evans Blue dye injections as an in vivo indicator of albumin leakage in mice (Imai et al. 2005). This vascular permeability was significantly attenuated in the lungs of AT1R knockout mice (Imai et al. 2005). These data indicate that loss of ACE2 expression and locally increased Ang II production trigger leakage of pulmonary blood vessels through AT1 receptor stimulation in ARDS (Imai et al. 2005; Fig. 2).",

One of the ACE targets is bradykinin, whereas ACE2 can catalyse the cleavage of bradykinin metabolites (Warner et al. 2004). Bradykinin is the key effecter in the kallikrein\u2013kinin system and also functions as a major proinflammatory mediator. Bradykinin mediates its biological effects via B1 and B2 receptors and is degraded by two main kinases, which are ACE and neutral endopeptidase (Warner et al. 2004). The in vivo effects mediated via B1 or B2 receptors are still poorly characterized, but it appears that B2 receptors mediate most of the known effects of bradykinin, including its antiproliferative, anti\u2010oxidant and antithrombotic effects (Marceau & Regoli, 2004). Expression of B1 receptors can be also induced by inflammatory cytokines (Schanstra et al. 2000), albeit the role of bradykinin and B1 receptors in Ang II\u2010induced inflammation remains unclear.",

Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 can also remove the C\u2010terminal residue from apelin and other vasoactive peptides, such as neurotensin and the neurotensin\u2010related peptide kinetensin. Moreover, the opioid peptides dynorphin A(1\u201313) and \u03b2\u2010casamorphin are ACE2 substrates in in vitro assays. Thus, although many ACE and ACE2 functions have been attributed to the regulation of Ang II levels, Ang II itself is probably only part of the RAS story, and other substrates might play a major role in mediating ACE2 functions.",

Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 has now been identified as a key factor for protection from ARDS/acute lung injury and it functions as a critical SARS receptor in vivo. Since SARS Spike protein\u2010mediated downregulation of ACE2 appears to contribute to the severity of lung failure, these findings may explain how the SARS coronavirus has turned into a lethal virus. In addition, in an acid aspiration ARDS mouse model, strong downregulation of ACE2 protein in the injured lung was observed, while ACE expression remained unchanged. Thus, recombinant ACE2 protein, which is under advanced development, could not only be a treatment to block the spread of SARS but could also protect SARS patients from developing lung failure. Furthermore, these findings could be applied to investigation of the therapeutic efficacy of ACE2 in the ARDS that develops in other emerging lung infectious diseases, such as avian influenza A (H5N1) or other yet unknown diseases that affect lung function. We look forward to the further elucidation of the pathophysiological role of the RAS in lung failure and to the use of recombinant ACE2 protein as a novel therapy for ARDS, which affects millions of people and for which no drug treatment yet exists.",
