Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues.

In the meanwhile, the number of confirmed and suspected cases is increasing rapidly. Estimating the epidemiological determinants of 2019-nCoV is significant and urgent regarding the assessment of epidemic transmissibility, the prediction of future trend of epidemic spreading, as well as the design of control measures. The basic reproduction number is the most important parameter to determine the intrinsic transmissibility, defined as the average number of secondary infectious cases generated by an index case in a completely susceptible population without any interventions [1] . During the outbreak of an epidemic, due to interventions and control measures from government, reaction of personal behaviors (sterilizing, wearing masks, washing hands, reducing contacts, etc.), the depletion of susceptible populations, and the seasonality of transmissibility, the basic reproduction number is generalized to the effective reproduction number, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case at time t, and is denoted by Rt. The epidemic is considered to be under control when Rt<1.",

Most Chinese people were aware of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV by the mainstream media after 20 January 2020. The Hubei government released the announcement about strengthening the prevention and control measures against 2019-nCoV, and launched the second-level public health emergency response at 2:40am on 22 January, 2020. Thus, the public awareness and effective interventions were absent when the time was prior to this point. As the median value of the incubation period of SARS was 6.4 days (95% CI 5.2 to 7.7 days) [5] , and the 2019-nCoV incubation period was 5.1 days according to a recent report on a few confirmed cases [6] , we inferred that the confirmed cases before 26 January, 2020 were infected during the free propagation of 2019-nCoV. Meanwhile, the confirmed cases after 25 January were not suitable for the analyses since the cases were generated in the following days were not during the free propagation.",

            "text": "Note that, the real number of cases was probably much larger than 2820. We considered this number as the optimistic situation (the lower bound of the number of cases having onset of symptoms). If we took the Northeastern University Reports [4] as the reference, there would be about 4 050 cases on 20 January 2020, and about 12 700 cases on 24 January, 2020. This result was mainly based on the number of confirmed cases in overseas which were exported from Wuhan. Even though there might be a large bias due to the highly limited samples, it should be seriously considered as all other methods were also very preliminary and some reports [9, 10] showed similar results to the Northeastern University Reports [4] . Read et al. [10] inferred that the actual number of confirmed cases was only 5.1%, including the cases without symptoms. If only 5% of symptomatic infections were detected (more pessimistic than the results of Read's study [10] ), then according to the confirmed cases (1 408) by 25 January, the number of cases with symptoms was 28 160, ten times larger than the optimistic one. We used it as the upper bound of Y(t) in sensitivity analysis. We set the date 8 December 2019, the presence time of the first pneumonia of unknown aetiology, as t=0. In fact, t might be slightly earlier than 8 December, since the symptoms might have appeared for some time before to the hospital. Hence, the estimated basic reproduction number might be a bit higher by using 8 December 2019 as t=0. Lipsitch et al. [12] showed that the average of g T is 8.4 days for SARS, while in the early outbreaks g T was higher (the average value was 10.0 days), and they suggested the sensitivity analysis interval as [8, 12] g T \uf0ce . Imai et al. [13] claimed that the case study reported in Chan's research [6] the same interval [10, 14] as suggested by Lipsitch et al [12] . As shown in Table 1 , the basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 based on the People's Daily Reports and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the Northeastern University Reports [4] . The estimated value of R0 by the Reports of the Northeastern University was similar to the value estimated by Read et al. [10] , which was in the range of [3.6, 4.0]. Our estimated values were higher than the ones ([2.1, 3.5], with a median value 2.6) by Imai et al. [13] . In accordance with the currently preliminary estimations, the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV was close to SARS. For example, the basic reproduction number of SARS by Lipsitch et al. [12] was [2.2, 3.6], and the average basic reproduction number of SARS by Riely et al. [14] was 2.7 (95%CI 2.2 to 3.7), but if considering the superspreading events, this average value rised up to 3.4. The basic reproduction number of SARS by Wallinga and Teunis [15] was from 3.1 to 4.2, which was not lower than our pessimistic result. Therefore, if we rely on the People's Daily Reports, the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was not higher than SARS, or even slightly lower than the basic reproduction number of SARS predicted by some other research teams. Even with the more predictions by the Northeastern University Reports, the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was only slightly higher than SARS. It was a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Concerning the previous experiences in fighting with SARS, the spreading of 2019-nCoV could be quickly reduced (probably in two or three weeks) through timely and effective control measures by government the accumulation of epidemiological survey data, the estimation of generation time would be more accurate, thus providing a more precise estimation of the basic reproduction number.",

The number of confirmed cases obtained from different sources varied widely. Since a significant proportion of patients with 2019-nCoV had mild symptoms, which could be healed without entering the hospital, there might be a large number of patients not in the official confirmed list. Consequently, we suggested to be more prudent. For example, the design of control measure should refer to the more pessimistic estimation (based on the Northeastern University Reports) rather than the more optimistic one (based on the People's Daily Reports). Our model assumes that the individuals in exposed state did not have or have very lower-level infectiousness (according to SARS), however, it was possible that for 2019-nCoV, individuals in the exposed state still had considerable infectiousness. Such possible difference was already taken into account by varying the value of \uf072 .",

The government's control policy and individuals' prevention behaviors were to reduce these parameters, and to eventually make the effective reproduction number Rt below 1. According to our results, if kD \uf062 could be reduced by 3/4 (to its 1/4), 2019-nCoV could be effectively controlled. Staying at home and cancelled meetings could decrease the frequency of contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. Wearing masks and washing hands could reduce the transmission probability \uf062 . If the individuals exhibit the suspected symptoms or have contacts with the highrisk groups, the corresponding medical observation and the isolation with other individuals were needed, which would shorten the effective infectious time period D. Restrictions on transportation, extension of winter holiday, and the cancellation of various conferences also aimed at reducing the effective reproductive number. Based on the preliminary information, a considerable amount of people infected with 2019-nCoV only show mild symptoms, and thus they had the same mobility as healthy people in principle. There were also some preliminary epidemiological findings suggesting that infected cases had infectiousness during the exposed period. These reasons, together with the delayed responses by Wuhan government, lead to a fiercer outbreak of 2019-nCoV than SARS. On the contrary, reducing the traveling and avoiding the meetings, in the meanwhile, wearing masks and washing hands frequently would suppress the effects caused by mild symptoms and exposed state with infectiousness. Relying on the Chinese experiences in fighting with SARS, we believed that 2019-nCoV would be effectively controlled soon.",
