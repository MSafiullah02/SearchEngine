PAH can be idiopathic, familial, or associated with a number of conditions or diseases, such as connective tissue disease. Its prognosis is poor, less than 3 yr from diagnosis. The aetiology of severe unexplained pulmonary hypertension remained largely unknown until a few years ago. The gene underlying familial PAH was identified in 2000, the BMPR-2 gene. However its mutations are not always present, and it probably does not explained the full scope of the disease. PAH is associated with structural alterations in pulmonary arteries including intimal fibrosis, medial hypertrophy and adventitial changes, pointing towards extracellular matrix remodelling which have raised the question of involvement of the matrix degrading enzymes. Among them, serine proteases, such as plasmina and endogenous vascular elastase (EVE), and matrix metalloproteases have been studied. In experimental models, the three of them are increased. Accordingly, their inhibition has preventing and in some cases therapeutic effects. However it should be stressed that opposite consequence of protease inhibition on PAH can be observed depending on the experimental model, either chronic hypoxia-induced PAH (deleterious) or toxic moncrotalin-induced PAH (positive). In humans, only sparse reports exist, that found increase in the MMP inhibitor, TIMP-1, and MMP-2 expression and decreased collagenase (MMP-1). Inflammation is part of the PAH, and accordingly, protease production is a well known part of the inflammatory response. Answering the question whether protease inhibition might represent a therapeutic option in human PAH is however certainly too early.",

However, the identification of the gene underlying familial PAH (FPAH) in 2000 provided a firm basis for mechanistic studies [6] [7] [8] . After localisation of the disease gene to the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q33) [9] , two independent groups identified heterozygous germline mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type II receptor (BMPR-II), a receptor for the transforming growth factor (TGF)-superfamily [7, 8] . Mutations in the BMPR2 gene have been found in approximately 70% of families [10] .

Although understanding of the pathobiological mechanisms underlying IPAH has progressed rapidly over the past few years, it is still unfeasible to classify patients on a pathogenic basis and to define therapeutic approaches accordingly. Current treatments, including continuous infusion of prostaglandin (PG)I 2 and oral endothelin receptor antagonists, probably address downstream manifestations of the disease rather than the central pathogenic mechanisms. The identification of the FPAH gene, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor (BMPR)-II, and the recognition of central pathobiological abnormalities associated with IPAH, now provide a unique opportunity to develop a more robust understanding of the disease. In the near future, this should serve to assess new treatments aimed at correcting selective pulmonary vascular remodelling processes, and, simultaneously, to validate the pathophysiological concepts.",

            "text": "Early studies, analysing the ultrastructure of pulmonary arteries on lung biopsy from patients with PAH, showed that the internal elastic lamina, which normally separates endothelial from smooth muscle cells in muscular arteries, is fragmented [15] . This suggested that an elastinolytic enzyme might be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. This was further explored in experimental PAH induced in rats by the toxin monocrotalin, in which an increased number of breaks in the internal elastic lamina was associated with the initiation of vascular structural changes as early as 4 days after the toxin injection [24] . Subsequently, early increase in elastinolytic activity that precedes vascular changes and a later increase associated with progressive disease were confirmed, and the inhibition profile of enzymatic activity showed that it was attributable to a serine protease [23]. This increased elastinolysis was also shown in chronic hypoxia-induced experimental PAH [25] . Jacob et al. [26] and Hornebeck et al. [27] showed that a serine elastase was produced by aortic smooth muscle cells and associated with atherosclerosis, which was further characterised by Zhu et al. in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells as the Endogenous Vascular Elastase (EVE) [28] . This elastase, like the polymorphonuclear neutrophil serine elastase, is inhibited by 1 -antitrypsin/ 1 -proteinase inhibitor ( 1 -PI), 2 -macroglobulin, elafin and by some synthetic inhibitors [29] , the most relevant inhibitor in vascular biology being elafin. EVE is a powerful enzyme that, by virtue of its ability to degrade elastin, will also degrade proteoglycans that serve as storage sites for growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and transforming growth factor. A study from Rabinovitch's group has shown that EVE releases FGF-2 in a biologically active form that stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation [30] . Elastase activity either directly or via activation of matrix metalloproteinases (see below) can induce production of the matrix glycoprotein tenascin (TN), which optimises the mitogenic response to FGF-2 and is, in fact, a prerequisite for the response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in cultured smooth muscle cells [19, 20] . The process of smooth muscle cell migration also appears to depend, at least in experimental animals, on the continued activity of elastase. Obviously, elastin peptides stimulate the production of the matrix glycoprotein fibronectin, which changes smooth muscle cells from a contractile to a migratory phenotype [31, 32].",

            "text": "Several observations point to an additional role of the plasminogen system in pulmonary hypertension and to enhanced plasmin proteolysis that contributes to pulmonary vascular remodelling. The central reaction of the plasminogen activator (PA) system is the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by plasminogen activators (PAs), the tissue plasminogen, tPA, and urokinase plasminogen activator, uPA [33] . The serine protease plasmin degrades fibrin to fibrin-degradation products. However, plasmin has several substrates other than fibrin, including blood coagulation factors, cell surface receptors, some matrix metalloproteinases, that plasmin activates, and structural components of the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin or laminin. While plasminogen resides primarily within the plasma, with the liver representing the primary site of plasminogen synthesis, plasminogen mRNA is present in several tissues, including adrenal, kidney, brain, testis, heart, lung, uterus, spleen, thymus, and gut, supporting a broadly distributed functional role of the PA system [34] . Tissue-type PA and u-PA activate plasminogen by cleaving a specific Arg-Val peptide bond located within the protease domain. The activation of plasminogen by t-PA is highly dependent on the presence of cofactors, such as fibrin, that bind and alter the conformation of plasminogen [35] . The activation of plasminogen by u-PA is tightly regulated at the cell surface, due to anchorage of u-PA to cell surface via a specific receptor, the uPA-R. Plasmin formation is intensely regulated by PA inhibitors, which inhibit t-PA and u-PA, most notably PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) [33] . Plasmin is directly inhibited by 2 -antiplasmin, which circulates in plasma.",

The development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury is diminished in plasminogen-deficient mice, supporting the concept that plasmin associated with vascular smooth muscle cells enhances cell migration by fostering extracellular matrix degradation, either directly or indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases [36] . Vascular smooth muscle cells express u-PA and its receptor. Urokinase (u-PA) deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of u-PA receptor, but not t-PA deficiency, inhibit neointima formation in mice, suggesting that u-PA-triggered plasmin formation drives vascular smooth muscle cell migration [37] [38] [39] . Regarding pulmonary vascular system and pulmonary hypertension, hypoxia increases expression of u-PAR, enhances plasma fibrinolytic activity, and upregulates expression of plasminogen activators during ventricular hypertrophy in response to hypoxia or overloading [40] [41] [42] . Interestingly, and also similar to elastase, plasmin could also participate in smooth muscle cell proliferation indirectly as it has been shown to induce the release of FGF-2 from the extracellular matrix [43] .",

One of the striking features of the matrixins is that many of those genes are 'inducible'. The effectors include growth factors, cytokines, chemical agents (e.g., phorbol esters, actin stress fibre-disrupting drugs), physical stress and oncogenic cellular transformation. MMP gene expression may be downregulated by suppressive factors (e.g., transforming growth factor, retinoic acids, glucocorticoids). Their proteolytic activities are precisely controlled during activation from their precursors and inhibition by endogenous inhibitors, -macroglobulins and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). All matrixins are synthesised as pre-pro-enzymes, the loss of the 'pre' peptide is a signal of secretion. Apart from a few members activated intracellularly by furin, most are secreted from the cell as inactive zymogens. Secreted promatrixins are activated in vitro by proteinases, such as plamin, and by nonproteolytic agents, such as in vivo reactive oxygen species and in vitro, thiol-reactive agents, mercurial compounds, and denaturants. In all cases, activation requires the disruption of the Cys-Zn 2+ (cystein switch) interaction between the zinc of the active site and the cystein present within the 'pro'-domain. Subsequently, the removal of the propeptide proceeds often in a step-wise manner [45] . In vivo, most promatrixins are likely to be activated by tissue or plasma proteinases, such as neutrophil elastase [46] or plasmin, or opportunistic bacterial proteinases. Using transgenic mice deficient in uPA, Carmeliet et al. have shown that the uPA/plasmin system is, in vivo, a pathophysiologically significant activator of promatrixins [45] . By contrast, no data exist regarding activation of promatrixin by EVE. Other activation cascades are known; for example, the activation of pro-MMP-2 takes place primarily on the cell surface and results from the action of membrane-anchored MMPs, the 'membrane-type MMPs' (MT-MMPs). Studies have shown that this activation process requires both active MT1-MMP and the TIMP-2-bound MT1-MMP [47] .",

Increases in interstitial collagenase (MMP-13), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) have also been described following return to normoxia [51, 52] . Interestingly, inhibition of MMPs by either a synthetic inhibitor, doxycycline, or adenovirusmediated human TIMP-1 gene transfer during chronic hypoxia is associated with exacerbation of PAH and vascular remodelling. Either of two MMP-inhibiting treatments increased muscularisation and collagen accumulation in small pulmonary arteries [53] , providing strong support for the argument that MMPs play a crucial protective role in hypoxic PAH. In keeping with these results is the demonstration that deficiency of uPA-mediated plasmin generation impairs vascular remodelling in hypoxic PAH [54] . MMPs and plasmin probably protect against PAH by limiting matrix deposition. Another important hypothesis concerns angiogenesis, which represents an important protective mechanism, as demonstrated by increase in lung vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during hypoxic PAH, improvement of PAH after VEGF gene transfer and worsening of PAH following angiostatin gene transfer [55, 56] .",

Similar results in this study, obtained by either serine-protease inhibitors or metalloprotease inhibitors, come from tight interactions between the two proteolytic systems, as elastase can activate some pro-MMPs [46] and degrade the MMP-inhibitor, TIMP-1 [57] . In contrast, most MMPs degrade the major elastase inbihitor, 1 -PI [46] . In keeping with the ex vivo results, in vivo experiments in toxic monocrotaline-induced PAH have shown that inhibition of MMPs by adenovirus-mediated human TIMP-1 gene transfer in the lung leads to less severe PAH with decreased muscularisation and increased lung-cell apoptosis, as compared to controls [58] . The effect of TIMP-1 on PAH is consistent with an ability of MMP inhibition to prevent monocrotalineinduced pulmonary vascular remodelling and PAH, in part by reducing smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. All together, these data support a synergistic and deleterious role for serine-and metalloproteases in toxic PAH and indicate that MMPs may have opposite effects in different PAH models.",

Approximately 30% of mutations are missense mutations occurring in highly conserved amino acids with predictable effects on receptor function. For example, many of these involve the serine-threonine kinase domain of BMPR-II or the extracellular ligand binding domain. However, the majority (~70%) of BMPR2 coding mutations are frameshift and nonsense mutations, many of which would be expected to produce a transcript susceptible to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, haploinsufficiency for BMPR-II represents the predominant molecular mechanism underlying inherited predisposition to FPAH. Further genetic analysis is revealing an increasing number of families in which BMPR-II mutation is implicated, including the identification of gene deletions and rearrangements.

Based on studies using cultured human smooth muscle cells isolated from elastic pulmonary arteries from IPAH patients obtained surgically, we reported MMP/TIMP production by smooth muscle cells in vitro. We also performed immunolocalisation in whole medium-sized pulmonary arteries. In vitro, TIMP-1 was overexpressed and MMP-3 underexpressed by IPAH cells, whereas MMP-1 expression was similar in the two groups. Total MMP-2 overexpression was also found, with a greater amount of the active form in IPAH cells as compared with controls. In situ studies showed gelatinolytic activity in tissue sections and strong MMP-2 immunostaining along the inner elastic lamina up to the lamina break. TIMP-1 immunostaining was found in both control and IPAH arteries, whereas MMP-3 staining was detected only in the media of a few control specimens [65] . It is unclear whether a similar pattern is present in distally remodelled pulmonary arteries; however, endothelial cells express moderate/intense immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2, while myofibroblasts display low levels of this extracellular protease [66] .

Proteolysis may be effective in limited areas even when TIMP levels are high in the extracellular milieu, because MMP-2 tethering and activation at the cell surface focuses the catalytic activity on limited targets on the cell membrane. This hypothesis is supported by immunohistology and in situ zymography data, which clearly show that gelatinolytic activity colocalised with MMP-2 immunostaining in arteries from IPAH patients [65] . This pattern of MMP and TIMP expression, characterised by increased TIMP-1 levels coexisting with evidence of extracellular matrix degradation, has been found in other fibrotic diseases, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from ARDS patients, TIMP-1 levels were significantly higher than in healthy controls. Despite the high TIMP-1 levels, extracellular matrix degradation by MMPs is suggested by the presence of active MMP-2 in epithelial lining fluid [67] and of basement membrane disruption markers in BAL fluid of ARDS patients [68] . Altogether, these data suggest that a TIMP-1-MMP imbalance promoting extracellular matrix accumulation within the interstitial tissue may coexist with the presence of active MMP-2 confined to the cell surface.",

All these considerations leave the question of their beneficial or deleterious role open. The tight interplay between the three proteolytic systems further complicates the answer. ",
