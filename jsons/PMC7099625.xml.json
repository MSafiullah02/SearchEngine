The same dilution technique was used for all samples. References were tested at a starting concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml. The highest concentration of solvent to which the parasites were exposed to had no measurable effect on the parasite viability (data not shown).",

Class 1 consists of molecules containing a saturated thiaheterocyclic ring annulated onto an indole core (designated as Tubathians), class 2 comprises benzothiophenes embodying a nitrogen atom in the linker region and class 3 includes cycloalkane-annulated 1,5-benzothiazepine scaffolds. Because of small structural modifications with respect to the \u2018mother structure\u2019 within each class (Figure 1 & Table 1), a broad set of 42 compounds with divergent decoration patterns is synthetically available. The preparation of these compounds 1\u20133 has previously been described, together with a detailed account on their HDAC6 selectivity, cellular activity (\u03b1-tubulin acetylation, a known substrate of HDAC6) and mutagenicity [20\u201323]. For Tubathian structures 1, additional information concerning the ADME/Tox properties has been disclosed as well [22]. These different classes include a number of highly potent and selective hHDAC6 inhibitors (Table 2), which have in common a para-substituted benzohydroxamic acid fragment, no substituents in the meta-position with respect to the hydroxamic acid group, and superior HDAC6 inhibitory activity for sulfoxides and sulfones over the corresponding sulfides.",

            "text": "The antiplasmodial activity of this set of structures was first determined through a modified parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay against a CQ-sensitive (CQS) strain of P. falciparum (NF54) [16,17]. When the molecules proved to be reasonably active against this strain (IC50 <5 \u03bcM), a second assay was performed against a CQ-resistant (CQR) strain of P. falciparum (Dd2), as well as an MTT-assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) on CHO cells to assess their mammalian cytotoxicity (Table 2) [18]. Finally, a selectivity index (SI = IC50 CHO/IC50 NF54) and a resistance index (RI = IC50 Dd2/IC50 NF54) was calculated to be able to easily compare the therapeutic window (active concentration vs toxic concentration) and sensitivity toward resistance developing. Table 2 shows that all 42 benzohydroxamic acids 1\u20133 display interesting antiplasmodial activities (IC50 values against the CQS strain between 0.11 and 37.5 \u03bcM). The potent HDAC6 inhibitors 1i, 1k, 1l, 3d, 3e and 3f were also found to be highly active against both CQS and CQR parasitic strains (IC50 CQS and CQR < 1 \u03bcM, IC50 HDAC6 < 0.07 \u03bcM). However, other active HDAC6 inhibitors did not demonstrate a distinct submicromolar parasitic toxicity (e.g., 1a, 1e and 1g). Thus, no consistent correlation can be drawn between hHDAC6 inhibition and antiplasmodial activity, which could be expected considering the inevitable differences between human and parasite HDAC isoforms [11]. On the other hand, it is remarkable to note that the most effective antiplasmodial compounds all are powerful hHDAC6 inhibitors, and none of the less active hHDAC6 inhibitors showed submicromolar antiplasmodial potency. Based on these observations, it can be suggested that strong hHDAC6 inhibitory activity is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for thiaheterocyclic benzohydroxamic acids to exert submicromolar antiplasmodial activity as well. From the six compounds showing the most promising antiplasmodial activity, four molecules have excellent selectivity indices higher than 300 (1i, 1k, 1l and 3d), which means that the concentration at which they kill the parasite is at least 300-times lower than their toxic concentration for CHO cells. Comparison of the resistance indices (RI) suggests that the tested molecules have comparable activity (RI = 0.3\u20133.9) against both strains (CQS and CQR). This is in marked contrast to the control drug CQ, which is 17-times less active against the CQR strain (RI = 17.5).",

This study revealed six selective HDAC6 inhibitors to demonstrate submicromolar antiplasmodial potency against both a CQS and a CQR strain, and four of these structures (1i, 1k, 1l and 3d) also proved to have an excellent therapeutic window (SI > 300). On the other hand, hydroxamic acids which do not strongly inhibit hHDAC6, appear to possess only moderate antiplasmodial effects. Thus, potent and selective hHDAC6 inhibitory activity of thiaheterocyclic benzohydroxamic acids seems to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition to elicit pronounced antiplasmodial activity as well. Moreover, selective hHDAC6 inhibitors can induce powerful P. falciparum toxicity without being toxic for CHO cells (as a model for mammalian cytotoxicity). In conclusion, hHDAC6 inhibitory activity and antiplasmodial activity are somehow interconnected, and these HDAC6i new chemical entities can certainly be considered a valuable starting point for further medicinal chemistry investigation en route to novel types of antiplasmodial drugs.",
