            "text": "UV/TiO2 process is based on the use of ultraviolet light (\u03bb\n < 400 nm) and TiO2 semiconductor photocatalyst. TiO2 has received increasing attention because of its low cost, relatively high chemical stability, and the possibility of using sunlight as a source of irradiation [11], [12], [13]. The process is initiated by UV irradiation of the semiconductor to excite an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) resulting in formation of a high energy electron-hole pairs (Eq. (1)). The highly oxidative valence band hole (redox potential of 2.8 V) may directly react with the surface-sorbed organic molecule or indirectly via the formation of \u2022OH radicals [14]. The reaction of the photo-generated holes with hydroxyl ions and water molecules adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 yields hydroxyl radicals (Eq. (4)) [15], [16] as well. Also, the conduction band electron (eCB\n\u2212) is negative enough to reduce the oxygen molecules, present in the solution (Eq. (3)). The generated hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidizing agents and attack organic pollutants, present at the surface of TiO2 or near it (within 500 \u03bcm) and of course the reaction rate of hydroxyl radicals with pollutants decreases as the distance from surface increases [17]. Dissolved oxygen plays an important role in TiO2 photocatalysis reaction to assure sufficient electron scavengers present to trap the excited conduction-band electron from recombination [18]. These functions cause the degradation of dye according to the following reactions (R is an organic compound) [7], [17], [19]:(1)TiO2 + h\u03bd (EG \u2265 3.2 eV) \u2192 TiO2 (eCB\u2212 + hVB+)\n(2)hVB+ + eCB\u2212 \u2192 heat (recombination)\n(3)O2(ads) + eCB\u2212 \u2192 O2\u2022\u2212\n(4)(H2O \u21d4 H+ + OH\u2212)ads + hVB+ \u2192 H+ + \u2022OH\n(5)O2\u2022\u2212 + H+ \u2192 HO2\u2022\n(6)2HO2\u2022 \u2192 H2O2 + O2\n(7)H2O2 + eCB\u2212 \u2192 \u2022OH + OH\u2212\n(8)R + \u2022OH \u2192 degradation\n(9)R + hVB+ \u2192 oxidation\n(10)R + eCB\u2212 \u2192 reduction\n",

Adding TiO2 particles in the solution causes two different effects: (i) rising active catalyst surface which leads to generating more active species in the media and more degradation efficiency, (ii) increasing the media turbidity which leads to a decrease in the amount of lights, reached to the catalyst surface and hence, diminishing the degradation efficiency. These two opposite effects will result an optimum amount for the catalyst dosage. This optimum value is attributed to the geometry and working conditions of the photo-reactor where the surface reaction is initiated upon light photon absorption [35]. When the amount of TiO2 increases, the solution turbidity will increase and the excess TiO2 particles can create a light scattering effect that reduces the surface area of TiO2 being exposed to light illumination and the photo-catalytic efficiency. In general, this phenomenon is called as \u201cinner filtration effect\u201d in photo-catalysis [36]. Therefore, any chosen photo-reactor should operate below this limit of TiO2 dosage, to avoid excess catalyst and ensure efficient photons absorption [20].",

The Photochemistry Commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) proposed a figure-of-merit (or more appropriately, an efficiency index, as it compares electrical efficiency of different AOPs) for UV-based AOPs. In the case of low pollutant concentration which is the case here, the appropriate figure-of-merit is the electrical energy per order (E\nEO), defined as the number of kWh of electrical energy required for reducing the concentration of a pollutant by 1 order of magnitude, and proposed in reference [50] as 90% degradation, in 1 m3 of contaminated water. E\nE (kWh/m3) can be calculated from the following equations [51], [52]:(37)EE=1000\u00d7P\u00d7t60\u00d7V\u00d7log(Ci/Cf)where P is the lamp power (kW) used in the AOP system, t is the irradiation time (min), V is the volume (L) of the contaminated water in the reactor and C\ni and C\nf are the initial and final pollutant concentrations.",

A reduction in the required electrical energy for treating 1 m3 of the substrate solution is appropriate, when temperature is increased. Considering the natural gas as the most common industrial used fuel for supplying thermal energy and its average heat of combustion which is about 39 MJ/m3 (corresponding to 0 \u00b0C and 101.3 kPa) and also its cost in U.S. (about 5.07 US$/28 m3) [53]; meanwhile, the cost for supplying 1 kWh industrial electricity in U.S. (about 0.065 US$) [53]; therefore, total cost of treatment process (E\nE\n + \nE\nQ) can be calculated at various temperatures (15 \u00b0C is considered as the base temperature). The results are given in Fig. 13\n. It can be seen that by increasing in temperature, the total treatment cost is decreased considerably (despite significant increase in thermal energy cost). This matter is due to the significant enhancement in degradation efficiency with temperature, as discussed in Section 3.4. Temperature can facilitate the dissociation of persulfate to sulfate radicals and also improve the activity of generated radicals.",

(ii) Appling homogenous AOPs, UV/H2O2 and UV/KPS under the optimum conditions of pH and temperature in addition to 270.3 mg/L of KPS or 34.0 mg/L of H2O2 results a 80.9% degradation of TX-100 in 60 min and a perfect degradation of it in only 30 min, respectively. (iv) Homogenous AOPs are more effective than heterogeneous one and UV/KPS process can be introduced as the best. (v) Simultaneous application of homogeneous oxidants with UV/TiO2 process cannot be desirable due to some retarding physico-chemical phenomena. (vi) A pseudo first order kinetic model, including temperature parameter, can adequately describe the degradation rate for the processes of UV/KPS and UV/TiO2, but an order of 2.27 for UV/H2O2 process. (vii) The Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood kinetic model showed a good agreement for the initial rates of degradation for UV/TiO2 process. (viii) The COD removal in the case of UV/KPS reaches to 61.2% after 60 min.
