By contrast, RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein antigenic site II humanized monoclonal antibodies, palivizumab and motavizumab, have been shown to reduce RSV-related hospitalization in infants. Immunogenicity and efficacy studies were conducted in cotton rats comparing a recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine with palivizumab and controlled with live RSV virus intranasal immunization and, formalin inactivated RSV vaccine. Active immunization with RSV F nanoparticle vaccine containing an alum adjuvant induced serum levels of palivizumab competing antibody (PCA) greater than passive administration of 15 mg/kg palivizumab (human prophylactic dose) in cotton rats and neutralized RSV-A and RSV-B viruses. Immunization prevented detectable RSV replication in the lungs and, unlike passive administration of palivizumab, in the nasal passage of challenged cotton rats. Histology of lung tissues following RSV challenge showed no enhanced disease in the vaccinated groups in contrast to formalin inactivated 'Lot 100' vaccine. Passive intramuscular administration of RSV F vaccine-induced immune sera one day prior to challenge of cotton rats reduced viral titers by 2 or more log 10 virus per gram of lung and nasal tissue and at doses less than palivizumab.

Most infected children present with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, but a subset develops severe lower respiratory tract disease characterized by tachypnea, hyperinflation, crackles, and expiratory wheezing (i.e., bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The most severe disease occurs within the first months of life in largely full term, healthy infants.

This allowed comparative evaluation of safety, 'functional' immunity as measured by PCA and neutralization assays, and protection in this clinically relevant model. The vaccine was shown to be safe, potent, to elicit high levels of neutralizing, PCA, anti-F antibodies and to be protective in both homologous and non-homologous strain viral challenge.

Fusion activity is critical to the viral pathogenesis and antibody binding to site II disrupts fusion activity [17] , together suggesting that selection pressure favors an immunologically cryptic site II. The 'universal' nature of the vaccine (protects against homologous and non-homologous virus), the absence of robust natural immunity to an antigen critical for pathogenesis such as site II on the F protein, the genetic stability of the palivizumab binding site [42] as compared to other sites such as antigenic site \u00d8 [43] , and the safety and the apparent potency of the vaccine, reinforce the premise that efficacy testing of the vaccine is warranted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 201, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 489, "end": 493, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The clinical development of an RSV vaccine may be divided amongst three populations: infants, infants/preschool children and the elderly. Maternal immunization, the active immunization of pregnant women to provide trans-placental transferred antibody for passive protection of the infant, is a priority strategy for protection of young infants against RSV and has been successfully employed for tetanus, pertussis and influenza vaccines [44] . Older infants and toddlers may also benefit from active immunization and many strategies including live viral vaccines and purified subunit vaccines have been employed in early clinical testing [45] . An RSV purified F protein showed clinical promise in children and CF patients, but proved difficult to manufacture and stabilize [22, 46] . The clinical evaluation of a novel vaccine must also take into account the history of the formalin inactivated RSV vaccine (Pfizer Lot 100 vaccine) that unexpectedly caused severe exacerbation of pulmonary disease in children who subsequently acquired RSV infections [33, 47] . Although the precise mechanisms underlying these findings remain open to debate [48] , the phenomenon of vaccine-enhanced RSV disease was limited to RSV-na\u00efve infants immunized with FI-RSV and has not been observed either with passive antibody prophylaxis (monoclonal or polyclonal) in clinical trials using purified F protein vaccines in adults or older RSV-seropositive children [22, 46, 49] . Thus, the path forward for development of a vaccine in older infants and children will need to be carefully considered. However, a vaccine that induces high affinity antibodies that exhibit neutralization or fusion inhibition in vitro, largely absent in FI-RSV vaccinated infants [50] , and is associated with protection without disease exacerbation in vivo in relevant animal models and finally shows efficacy in another setting such as maternal immunization may be considered in the absence of a licensed vaccine for this population. Finally, the RSV disease burden in elderly and high risk adults and the data indicating an F subunit vaccine is safe along with the absence of historical safety concerns due to enhanced disease in this population suggests further testing of the safety and efficacy as a seasonal respiratory vaccine is warranted.
