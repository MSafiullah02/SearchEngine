We have shown for the first time that in addition to the effects of smoking, gender, and starting FEV 1 %Pred on lung function decline, that patients with high indexes when stable of plasma fibrinogen, sputum neutrophils, sputum eosinophils, and sputum IL-6 all had a more rapid decline over time of FEV 1 %Pred. We have also shown that patients with persistent lower airway bacterial colonization as evidenced by a high lower airway bacterial load when stable and exacerbation free also had a faster FEV 1 %Pred decline. Patients with a faster rising plasma fibrinogen, neutrophil count, or bacterial load also had a faster decline. We have previously shown in this cohort of patients that a history of frequent exacerbations hastens lung function decline, 4 and this study shows that these frequent exacerbators have faster rises in airway and systemic inflammatory markers. For the first time, these results provide evidence that increased airway inflammation, due possibly to frequent exacerbations, is associated with a faster lung function decline in patients with COPD. Plasma fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant that is synthesized in the liver mainly under the control of the cytokine IL-6 and secreted into the circulation. We and others have previously reported that plasma fibrinogen is elevated in patients with stable COPD, and we also showed that levels rise at exacerbation. 9 In this study, the median plasma fibrinogen was 3.89 g/L, which is higher than would be expected for ageand sex-matched control subjects. 9, 23, 24 We found that patients with a high plasma fibrinogen level during the initial stages of this study subsequently had a more rapid lung function decline, consistent with the results of a previous cross-sectional study. 10 The annual rise we observed in this study for plasma fibrinogen was 0.1 g/L/yr, less than the rise of 0.31 g/L at COPD exacerbation but greater than that of 0.03 g/L/yr observed in a cross-sectional study 25 of 20-to 70-year-old normal subjects. Plasma fibrinogen is arguably the most important risk factor for coronary heart disease, 26 and so our discovery that it is associated with accelerated decline in lung function suggests a mechanism for the epidemiologically proven relationship between cardiovascular risk and obstructive lung disease. [27] [28] [29] There has been considerable interest in the etiology of the systemic inflammatory response in patients with COPD. This systemic inflammatory response has been associated with weight loss and muscle wasting, characteristic of more severe COPD. 30 -32 Levels of systemic markers rise further at exacerbation, 8, 33 and it has been suggested by others that the systemic inflammatory response at exacerbation is associated with peripheral muscle weakness. 34 In this study, we were unable to show a relationship between stable sputum IL-6 and plasma fibrinogen, suggesting that there is no direct link between systemic and airway inflammation. This is in agreement with a previous study 35 that also showed that these two compartments were not related. It suggests that the origin of the systemic response is not caused solely by release of airway inflammatory mediators into the systemic circulation, and further research is required in this area.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 989, "end": 990, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1625, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1766, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1770, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1773, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1993, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2331, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2542, "end": 2546, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2551, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2552, "end": 2556, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2806, "text": "30 -32", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2866, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2867, "end": 2869, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3009, "end": 3011, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3240, "end": 3242, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our study, we also found that neutrophils, a marker of airway inflammation, rose over the study period and was related to FEV 1 decline.

Two studies 4,5 now show that frequent exacerbators have a more rapid decline in lung function. Thus, we suggest that the mechanism by which these acute events contribute to the chronic deterioration in FEV 1 decline is by causing a faster rate of rise in airway inflammation. This is consistent with the higher sputum IL-6 and IL-8 levels in stable (nonexacerbating) patients who have a history of frequent exacerbations compared to those with infrequent exacerbations. 8 The elevated systemic inflammatory response in the frequent exacerbators suggests that this group may be particularly prone to muscle weakness with increasing disease severity and thus they may be an important group to target for pulmonary rehabilitation.

We also found that patients with a high starting FEV 1 %Pred had a faster decline. This is contrary to the conventional idea that a high FEV 1 is due to a slow decline and a low FEV 1 to a fast decline.

Firstly, for many patients, the initial microbial and inflammatory marker samples used to differentiate the patients into the high and low groupings were obtained at different times, with respect to the calendar date and time elapsed from recruitment, when and if they were able to produce sufficient sputum for analysis. The use of samples that were not collected at commencement of the study is not a serious drawback, as our primary outcome measure-annual decline in FEV 1 %Pred-should be the same before or after the date of sampling, assuming a linear decline over the period the patients were investigated. It is possible that patients transferred from the low to the high grouping during the study; however, any bias from this would be to make it less likely that a significant difference would exist between the high and low groups. Secondly, our data set is incomplete because-like all cohort studies-there are unavoidable dropouts.
