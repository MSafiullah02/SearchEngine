It is already clear that children have considerably better outcomes than adults (particularly older adults \u226570 years), with a mortality of less than 1%. 1,2 In the adult population, those with pulmonary or cardiac comorbidities have worse outcomes than those without these comorbidities. 1 We are currently managing an ongoing survey that includes children aged 0-19 years with kidney disease on immunosuppressive medication who are diagnosed with COVID-19. The study was initiated by the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network and is supported by the European, Asian, and international paediatric nephrology societies. The members of these societies and the members of the listserv, Pedneph, were asked at regular intervals to include any child in their care fulfilling these criteria. The information was collected in a totally anonymised manner.",

Similarly, a study with eight children with inflammatory bowel disease found that all children diagnosed with COVID-19 had a mild infection, despite treatment with immunomodulators, biologics, or both. 3 The low number of children thus far in our global survey is consistent with a study from Lombardy, Italy. 4 Grasselli and colleagues 4 described 1591 patients who needed treatment in intensive care. 4 Of those 1591 patients, only four were younger than 20 years. At the time of publication, none of these four young people had died, but two still needed treatment in intensive care. Three of these four individuals had some undefined comorbidity.",

Analysis of our data across four countries where survey dissemination and case reporting is known to be high suggests that the incidence of COVID-19 in the paediatric kidney transplant population is similar to the background incidence of COVID-19 in the general population (appendix). However, we accept that this type of survey does not have a truly systematic approach to identifying cases, which limits our study. Studies with higher numbers of children are needed to confirm these early findings and identify any longterm consequences of, and the level of immunity that might be acquired from, COVID-19. We therefore encourage readers of this Correspondence to report all children under their care who fulfil our inclusion criteria to our study.",
