In regard to viruses and their exploitation of sumoylation, two possible scenarios can be envisioned: a viral protein that influences sumoylation, and/or a viral protein that needs to be sumoylated in order to exert its function. One type of virus\u2013host interaction that is well established and widespread is the modulation of viral protein function by post-translational modification systems, which include sumoylation.",

First, SUMO proteins are post-translationally processed by SUMO proteases to expose a COOH-terminal diglycine motif, which can then form a thioester bond with the catalytic cysteine of the E1-activating enzyme, the SAE1/SAE2 (SUMO activating enzyme) heterodimer. Second, this activation step is followed by conjugation of the activated SUMO to the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) through the formation of another thioester bond. Finally, through the mutual action of UBC9 and E3 SUMO ligases, SUMO is bound to its target on a lysine residue, by an isopeptide bond. The system is dynamic and reversible by isopeptidases, which can hydrolyze this covalent bond, causing the removal of SUMO, which can then cycle again (Figure 1\n) [1, 2, 3\u2022, 4\u2022].",

PML NBs are sub-nuclear complex structures, with no unique defined role, that become disrupted during infection by most DNA viruses. The exact role of the disruption of PML NBs by the regulatory proteins of DNA viruses is still not clear. However, the importance of their disruption at very early stages of virus infection has been suggested by a number of findings [3\u2022].",

Two recent studies have given a slightly different twist to the role of sumoylation for this immediate-early viral protein [14, 15]. In the attempt to assess the role of SUMO for this particular protein, the authors created a recombinant virus that is mutated in the SUMO\u2013IE1 attachment lysine residue and studied the phenotypic consequences of this mutation [15]. They showed that SUMO modification is not absolutely required for productive viral infection, but clearly contributes to full activity of E1. This evidence suggests that the non-conjugated and SUMO-conjugated forms of IE1 might perform distinct functions during virus infection. Indeed, lack of sumoylation did not affect the ability of IE1 to reach the nucleus, disrupt PML bodies or bind chromatin. However, sumoylation of IE1 did contribute to efficient HCMV replication by promoting the expression of IE2, the principal transcriptional activator of the HCMV lytic cycle; therefore, the former most abundant non-conjugated isoform might facilitate expression of early viral genes and viral replication by promoting SUMO-independent activities, whereas the SUMO-conjugated variant supports efficient lytic viral growth.",

Studies have suggested that modification of PML by SUMO is essential to form NBs, and essential for the maintenance of their integrity. IE1 binds to PML and prevents or removes SUMO adducts from it. Lee et al. [14] have now shown that the ability of HCMV-IE1 protein to modulate sumoylation of PML correlates with its functional activities in transcriptional regulation and infectivity. In fact, the activity of IE1 in the regulation of transcription directly correlated with its ability to bind to and to desumoylate PML, thereby disrupting PML NBs. This study also confirms that HCMV and HSV type 1 (HSV-1) seem to use different mechanisms to desumoylate PML. Specifically, the disruption of NBs by HSV-1 ICP0 \u2014 which itself has an intrinsic ubiquitin E3 ligase activity \u2014 was prevented by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; Z-LLL-CHO). On the contrary, HCMV IE1 interferes with sumoylation of PML in a proteasome-independent manner [14].",

This also remains an attractive model for other viral proteins, but additional studies are required to confirm whether endogenous proteases can be recruited to these structures by viruses, thereby promoting desumoylation.

Consistent with this, one of the most recent examples reported in the literature is the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus\u2019 (KSHV) early lytic-cycle, K-bZIP (KSHV basic leucine zipper protein). K-bZIP repression activity correlates with its ability to be sumoylated and to recruit UBC9 to specific viral target promoters, exerting this protein's transcriptional repression activity [18\u2022\u2022]. One attractive hypothesis suggested by the authors is that K-bZIP functions like a SUMO ligase or a SUMO E3 adaptor, localizing UBC9 with its potential substrates and modifying the chromatin structure surrounding the transcriptional complex where K-bZIP resides. K-bZIP therefore joins the list of sumoylated herpesvirus immediate-early proteins, which include HCMV IE1 and IE2, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Zta and Rta, and human herpes virus-6 (HHV6)-IE1 [3\u2022].",

EBV Zta was shown to be modified by SUMO and to disperse PML NBs, perhaps by out-competing PML for a limited amount of intracellular SUMO [21]. Furthermore, in reporter assays, SUMO inhibited Zta trans-activation of both the EBV BMRF1 and Rta promoters, but had no effect on Rta trans-activation activity [22]. Chang et al. [23] instead showed the EBV Rta protein to be SUMO-modified and that this modification increases the trans-activation activity of Rta. This discrepancy is probably associated with the promoters selected in each study, or because different cell lines were used. Nevertheless, the different effects of SUMO modification on trans-activation properties of immediate-early proteins from the same virus could be a way of enabling the virus to fine-tune viral trans-activation activities. Another example of a herpesvirus protein transcription factor enhanced by sumoylation is HCMV-IE2. HCMV-IE2 appears to have a major role in promoting the replicative cycle for HCMV, by exerting two well-defined activities during infection: first, it acts as a powerful non-specific trans-activator of both early viral and cellular genes; and second, it acts as a transcriptional repressor of its own promoter [3\u2022, 24]. There is now evidence that HCMV-IE2 is covalently modified by SUMO, and this modification appears to be required for trans-activation function of this IE2 [25, 26], further supported by data showing a correlation between its trans-activation activity and sumoylation level [27]. However, sumoylation of HCMV-IE2 is not required for virus growth in cultured human fibroblasts [28], leaving the still-open question as to whether sumoylation of HCMV-IE2 plays a role in viral infection. HCMV-IE2 was also found to be the first viral target regulated by a SUMO E3 ligase [29]. In fact, the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT [signal transducer and activator of transcription] 1) stimulates conjugation of SUMO to IE2, similarly to Rta protein of EBV [23]. These are two examples of immediate-early viral proteins where the role of SUMO is to enhance their trans-activation activities. Interestingly, PIAS1 is the only SUMO E3 ligase found to date to enhance sumoylation of viral proteins. Briefly, three classes of mammalian E3 ligases have been found [4\u2022], but their substrate-specificity and to what extent the substrate-specificity of these SUMO E3 ligases overlap is still unknown.",

Recent studies with chimeric viruses containing different regions of the viral Gag genes of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and HIV type 1 (HIV-1) have suggested that the Gag capsid (CA) protein is a dominant determinant of retrovirus infectivity [35]. Interestingly, a binding site in the CA for both UBC9 and PIASy was found and mapped in Moloney MuLV [36]. CA sumoylation was required for formation of the nuclear viral DNA forms and for viral replication [36]. Furthermore, the p6 Gag of HIV-1 has recently been shown to be modified by SUMO [37]. Although mutation of this residue had no apparent effect on virus replication, overproduction of SUMO decreased HIV-1 virion infectivity, and the non-sumoylated mutant virus was resistant to this effect, suggesting that SUMO modification of HIV-1 p6 regulates HIV-1 infectivity [37]. HIV-1 expresses several regulatory proteins, which allow efficient production of viral particles. Particular focus has been given to two of them, Tat and Rev, because the functions they exert are necessary to viral replication. As a note of interest, Tat has been recently shown as a modulator of cellular protein ubiquitination [38\u2022]. A report has demonstrated how HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by using peptides that target Rev [39]. Association of these peptides with SUMO for their stabilizations enabled them to efficiently penetrate within lymphocytes and, in some cases, inhibit the function of Rev [39].",

In other types of cancers, NF-\u03baB is crucial for the induction of adult T-cell leukemia, which is linked to infection by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The HTLV-1 regulatory protein is Tax, a potent transcriptional activator with oncogenic potential, in part because of its ability to activate the NF-\u03baB pathway. Tax activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway involves its interaction with the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO)\u2013IKK\u03b3. A recent report has shown that Tax is sumoylated and ubiquitinated on overlapping lysine residues, determining then the partitioning of Tax in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments [43\u2022\u2022]. Tax only co-localized with ubiquitin and IKK complexes in the cytoplasm, followed by the translocation of the RelA subunit of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Deubiquitinated Tax then migrates to the nucleus, where it becomes sumoylated and is able to assemble NBs that contain both Rel A and IKK\u03b3, leading to the activation of specific Tax-responsive genes. Desumoylated Tax can then exit the nucleus [43\u2022\u2022]. Thus, both modifications are crucial for Tax-mediated transcriptional activity, and might result in targets for treatment of adult T-cell leukemia.",

            "text": "It is clear that SUMO is important for viruses and although putative functions have been attributed to sumoylation, the precise biological role played by this process in terms of viral fitness remains to be determined. This scenario has become complicated owing to most recent emerging ideas, which support evidence for non-covalent interactions with SUMO. Briefly, SUMO-like proteins have been studied mainly in the context of their covalent conjugation to target proteins. However, data is now pointing towards the possibility that proteins containing SUMO-interacting motifs can non-covalently interact with SUMO, without necessarily being modified by SUMO [44, 45]. Among viruses, a few known examples include the nucleocapsid proteins from two hantaviruses and a retroviral Gag protein [3\u2022]. Most recently EBV nuclear antigen 3C has been described as containing such a SUMO-associating domain, necessary for transcriptional activation [46]. Taken together, this data implies a possible novel mechanism of binding target sequences by SUMO through a SUMO-binding motif, with the consequence of providing another level of control for SUMO over its targets.",
