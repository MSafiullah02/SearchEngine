This is especially true among high\u2010risk occupational settings where animal workers have close and prolonged contact with many animals. Recently, agricultural professionals in routine contact with production animals have been shown to have an increased risk of zoonotic infections and often experience symptomatic illnesses (Meng et al., 2002; Olsen et al., 2002; Koopmans et al., 2004; Myers et al., 2006; Gray and Baker, 2007; Gray et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008; Kayali et al., 2010). Dogs are a popular companion animal, but the canine industry is a less\u2010studied occupational setting. Overcrowded shelters and breeding kennels create the perfect environment for amplified infectious disease transmission among dogs and a critical opportunity for zoonotic pathogens to emerge and infect people who work in close contact with dogs.",

Similar to how other coronaviruses undergo genetic evolution, CRCoV evolved through accumulations of point mutations, insertions and deletions within the coronavirus genome (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008). Following its discovery, evidence of CRCoV infection or seropositivity has been documented in dogs with various clinical histories in Japan, Italy, New Zealand, Korea, Canada and the United States. CRCoV plays a role in the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRD or \u2018kennel cough\u2019) and is now considered enzootic among dog populations (Priestnall et al., 2006; Erles and Brownlie, 2008). Human infections with CRCoV have never been reported or studied. To investigate evidence of CRCoV infections in humans, a seroepidemiological cohort study was conducted in the United States. We sought to test the hypothesis that dog workers would have a higher prevalence of antibodies against CRCoV compared to non\u2013dog\u2010exposed controls.",

Sera from CRCoV\u2010positive and CRCoV\u2010negative dogs were used as positive and negative assay controls. CRCoV\u2010infected and uninfected control cell culture lysates were diluted to approximately 20 \u03bcg/ml protein in carbonate\u2010bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6.

Plates were washed once with PBS. Undiluted human sera were mixed 1 : 1 with HCoV OC43 culture supernatant and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h.

ELISA plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then washed three times in wash buffer (0.05% Tween\u00ae 20 in PBS). Detection of human IgG bound to the plates was accomplished by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of goat anti\u2010human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (KPL) diluted 1 : 6000 in dilution buffer was added to wells where blocked human sera had been added.

Following a 1\u2010h incubation at room temperature, plates were washed three times in wash buffer. Detection of the HRP\u2010conjugated antibodies bound to the plates was accomplished by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate 2 (TMB) (KPL). After a 10\u2010min incubation in the dark at room temperature, the TMB reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 \u03bcl 1 N sulphuric acid (Fisher Scientific). Within 30 min of stopping the reaction, absorbance was read at 450 nm wavelength using the Powerwave 340 automated microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek). Values from the duplicate wells of CRCoV\u2010coated and uninfected cell control wells were averaged for each serum sample.
