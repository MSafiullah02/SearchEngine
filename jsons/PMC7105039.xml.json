Among the four GB programs, the hospital GB program in 2004 accounted for approximately 65% of the total National Health Insurance (NHI) expenditure.5 The current Taiwan GB program is an expenditure-cap system with a \u201cfloating point value\u201d mechanism that is used to precisely match the predetermined budget using the formula:[1]\u03a3[(servicevolume)\u00d7(unitprices)]\u00d7[floatingpointvalue]\n",

To meet the predetermined national expenditure, the total expenditure claimed is reimbursed based on an adjusted amount\u2014the expenditure claimed multiplied by the floating point value. The floating point value for each hospital is retrospectively determined every 3 months after the completion of official review for previous claims. According to the formula, the floating point value is negatively associated with the nationwide service volume, which includes the number of patients seen and issued medical orders. A higher service volume will result in a lower floating point value that year for all contracted hospitals. For the purpose of reducing the growing expenditures on health care, the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in Taiwan introduced \u201cHospital-based Self-management\u201d in January 2004, which is a hospital-based GB program.6 The BNHI encouraged hospitals to participate voluntarily in the Hospital-based Self-management project. Many adaptive medical approaches to the implementation of GB in hospitals have been applied, which include: (1) persuading and enforcing physicians to prescribe cheaper drugs; (2) limiting the kinds of drugs drawn into the hospital; and (3) implementing computerized physician order management to reduce drug expenditures.7 Because of the impact of GB, changes in physicians' medical behavior such as reduced prescription of drugs, limited daily service hours in clinics,8 and reduced drug expenditures9 have been noted in studies conducted in Western countries. The progressive implementation of GB for different medical services has enabled researchers to examine the effects of the policy on clear timelines.",

However, in Taiwan and in other nations, there are few data supporting this postulation. Furthermore, psychiatric services in Taiwan are provided by four main types of institutions: medical centers, psychiatric centers, public hospitals, and private hospitals. Business operating characteristics such as finance and management model are assumed to be different among various types of hospitals.10, 11, 12 We postulated that the incentives for psychiatrists to prescribe SGA vary by hospital type. To our knowledge, the impact of GB on psychiatrists' prescriptions of SGA for schizophrenic patients has not been investigated. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of GB on the use of SGA prescriptions by psychiatrists in various types of hospitals.",

First, does the implementation of hospital-based GB affect psychiatrists' ongoing prescription of SGA for the treatment of schizophrenia? Second, if this kind of impact does exist, is it different among various types of hospitals? This study accordingly examined two hypotheses: (1) after the implementation of GB, the proportion of SGA use in outpatients would still show a rising trend, regardless of the effects of GB; and (2) compared to psychiatrists in the public sector and psychiatric centers, their counterparts in the private sector and in medical centers are less likely to decrease their use of SGA prescriptions.",

Data from between 2001 and 2004 were collected from the NHI database, which included outpatients who were diagnosed as having schizophrenia during the period of 1996\u20132001. The SGAs included in the study were clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepin, and amisulpride. We set the \u201cdividing point\u201d as January 2004 for several reasons. First, physicians' behavior may have been affected by a lag effect after the implementation of a hospital physician integration strategy.13 Second, during the months of April 2003 through December 2003, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome may have prevented patients from going to the hospitals to see their doctors in person14; they may instead have preferred chronic disease refill cards to maintain their previous treatments. Third, after the implementation of GB, the medical charges in certain areas within hospital departments were still not under GB control from July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003.15 The percentages of SGA expenditures (i.e., the expenditure of SGA/the expenditure of all antipsychotics) in outpatient departments were calculated for the observation period.

The financial incentive in GB was a key factor affecting physicians' medical behavior. The GB program in Taiwan adopts the concept of expenditure cap and predetermines the amount of reimbursement.9 A set of indicators is assessed: quality indicators, observation indicators, and survey indicators. If the medical cost is above a predetermined upper limit, the NHI will not cover the amount that exceeds the limit. If the medical cost is below the upper limit and the standards of a set of indicators are reached, the hospital can make a certain amount of profit. As noted in one study,4 hospitals must reasonably reduce some costs such as pharmaceutical expenditures to maximize margins. An investigation of a psychiatric department in a general hospital that had implemented GB revealed the following phenomena: \u201cincreased number of days of prescription for psychiatric outpatient visits, diminution of the average length of hospitalization, and a reduction in the kinds of medication typically prescribed during hospitalization\u201d.13\n",

For the public sector, there is a weaker motivation to reap profits12 and to receive the maximum budgetary imbursement from the NHI program. There is less financial pressure on public hospitals than on hospitals in the private sector.12 Public hospitals have consequently shown a slower response to changes in medical policies.16 In addition, the public sector tends to be held to a higher standard by the general population to meet their expectations, and this suggests that physicians in the public sector are likely to have a stronger concern for the welfare of the patients.12 Some private hospitals in Taiwan have conversely adopted a physician fee program to improve physicians' performance. Hence, leaders and physicians in public hospitals are probably less influenced by economic incentives. Thus, they may tend to prescribe SGAs more in accordance with their patients' needs and be less affected by nonclinical factors.",

Because there are strict privacy regulations which limit access to certain data in the NHI database, it was not possible to identify which hospitals were taking part in the hospital-based GB after July 2003. Hence, we used the whole database to compare the changes of the prescribing pattern after the implementation of GB in our study. This possibly underestimated the extent of decreased use of SGA. However, global trends of SGA use were obviously changed after the dividing timepoint. Thus, we are confident that GB did indeed have an effect on SGA use, even though not all medical or psychiatric centers joined the GB program during the study period. If drug prices had changed during the observation period, the analysis of changes in the proportion of drug expenditures could have been confounded. However, there was no significant change of drug prices during the study period in our survey.",

In recent years, metabolic syndrome caused by SGAs has become an important issue.27, 28, 29 Many psychiatrists are becoming more cautious and conservative in prescribing SGAs because of education by reading current literature, engaging in peer group discussions, and attending international forums. This effect may be less pronounced in our study for the following reasons. The impact of education with regard to complications of SGA was assumed to be distributed evenly in each type of hospital. After the implementation of GB, there was no official advisory in Taiwan on the metabolic side effects of all kinds of SGAs that was similar to the advisory on SSRIs issued by the FDA in the United States.",

More research is needed on this increasingly important issue because many governments are adopting health policies to contain expenditure, which could result in reduced quality of care, especially for those with severe mental illness. We herein propose several recommendations, based on our findings that health policymakers may find useful. The government should identify psychiatric patients with major psychiatric disorders so that adequate care can be provided, even in the event that the expenditure cap is exceeded. It is also important to carefully evaluate the future impact of health policy prior to its implementation, and subsequently design a more stable strategy to avoid reducing these patients' quality of care (e.g., by limiting the use of SGAs). Furthermore, it is important for the government to value the important contribution of public psychiatric hospitals and to maximize the financial aid and quality of care in the public sector. Further suggestions include the following: after the implementation of GB, outcomes can be compared regarding medical quality or patients' quality of life such as readmission rates, years of hospitalization, suicide rates, and level of patient satisfaction. In addition, the same model can be applied to assess the extent of change in the prescription pattern for other psychotropic medications such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers.",
