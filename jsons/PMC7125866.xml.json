None of the patients had radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Spirometry was performed and nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were obtained for virology,2 bacterial culture, and quantitative cell counts.3 Measurements were repeated at 1, 4, and 6 weeks until symptoms had completely resolved. Procalcitonin was measured in serum at the time of exacerbation and at 6 weeks. Procalcitonin was measured in duplicate from 50 \u03bcL of serum using a time-resolved amplified cryptate emission technology assay (Kryptor TRACE PCT; Brahms; Berlin, Germany). The lower limit of detection is 0.02 ng/mL, and the assay functional sensitivity was 0.06 ng/mL. All patients gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton.",
