            "text": "In December 2019 numerous people in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province of China, developed infection and respiratory symptoms from an unknown pathogen. Within a month, scientists identified a novel coronavirus and named it 2019-nCoV. This virus was designated as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the World Health Organization subsequently named the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID- 19 . 1 Shortly thereafter, the COVID-19 rapidly spread through Wuhan and by February 2020 there were over 14,000 confirmed cases and 305 deaths in China and 23 other countries. By the time quarantine and other methods of containment were started, the virus had already spread worldwide. On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and as of April 2, 2020 there are over 1,000,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 46,000 deaths. 2 COVID-19 has affected all age groups from children to older adults, more men than women, and has worse outcomes in patients with comorbid chronic illnesses such as respiratory illnesses, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. 3 SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and has similarities to prior coronaviruses that are known or presumed to enter the human population from animals. 4 The respiratory manifestations are similar to two prior coronavirus outbreaks, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) from 2002/3 and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted via droplets and possibly by airborne inhalation of aerosolized particles. 5 Droplet transmission occurs typically in close contact (\u22641 m) with a person who coughs or sneezes and when respiratory droplets come into contact with mucosal membranes of the mouth, nose, or of the conjunctiva of the eyes. Additionally, transmission of COVID-19 can occur by contact with surfaces contaminated with respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission occurs through virions within droplet nuclei (generally particles <5\u03bcm in diameter) that can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. Airborne transmission is not likely to be a major mode of transmission in the community, but is definitely a concern in clinical situations where aerosols are generated, such as endotracheal intubation, nasopharyngeal suctioning, and endoscopic procedures. 6 In addition, because SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in stool, it has been postulated that fecal transmission may be possible, but this has not been confirmed. 7, 8 A recent report confirmed detection of viral particles in stool, but suggested that it was at quantities that were not infectious. 9 SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The spike protein of the virus is primed by the transmembrane protease serine 2 precursor, which facilitates virus-cell membrane fusions. 10 ACE2 receptors are expressed on different cell types in the body and appear to be most expressed in intestine, but can be found in many other organs including lung, tongue, and pancreas. 11 The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and respiratory symptoms, but it is now understood that a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 will have alterations in bowel habits or other digestive symptoms. These symptoms may reflect inoculation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from swallowing virus and due to the ACE2 expression in the intestines. 12 Additional recent reports have focused on both the GI-related manifestations of COVID-19 as well as the fact that virus is detectable in stool long after resolution of respiratory symptoms or even detection of virus in the oropharynx. 8 While the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have particular concerns for their risk for infection and management of their medical therapies. This clinical practice update incorporates the emerging understanding of COVID-19 and summarizes available guidance for patients with IBD and the providers who take care of them. This expert commentary was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely perspective on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.",

However, it has been established that while viral RNA has been identified in roughly half of patients with COVID-19, persisting in many even after respiratory samples turned negative, there has not been a clear association with GI symptoms and the presence of viral RNA in the stool. 7, 8 Diarrhea (patient-defined) was present in only 10.1% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan China (16.7% of those in the ICU) 16 ; while another study showed that roughly half of patients had digestive symptoms as part of their presentation to the hospital with COVID-19 and pneumonia, only one third had diarrhea. 12 Of interest, patients with GI symptoms from the Zhejiang Province had a much lower incidence of GI symptoms (11.45%), reflecting the possibilities of different viral strains, reporting differences, or both. 17 In all of these reports, patients with digestive symptoms most frequently had concurrent fever and respiratory symptoms as well. Given the prevalence of non-specific digestive symptoms in the population and especially in patients with IBD, the clinical implications of this are quite important. Patients who develop new digestive symptoms but who do not have fever or respiratory symptoms can be monitored for the progression of symptoms that might guide timing of testing for SARS-CoV-2, and in patients with IBD, trigger additional treatment adjustments.",

It is too early to make definitive conclusions, but of 164 patients reported to the registry at the time of this writing, patients with severe IBD and COVID-19 (reported as Physician's Global Assessment) are more likely to be hospitalized related to their IBD or COVID-19 (or both).

To this end, we have incorporated the general guidance and consensus statements from the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) 19 and from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD). 15, 20 We divide the considerations for therapy management in IBD into three categories: 1) the patient with IBD who is NOT infected with SARS-CoV-2, 2) the patient with IBD who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and asymptomatic (e.g. IBD is in remission and has not developed manifestations of COVID-19) and 3) the patient with IBD who has confirmed COVID-19, with or without active bowel inflammation or other digestive symptoms.",

            "text": "The available data and expert opinions suggest that patients with IBD are not at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the general recommendation is to stay on IBD therapies with a goal of sustaining remission, ideally defined as a composite of both symptomatic (clinical) remission and objectively confirmed inflammation control (endoscopic improvement and normalized laboratory values). Patients should be advised to maintain their current regimens and to avoid relapse due to non-adherence. Aside from the obvious negative consequences of a relapse, relapsing IBD will strain available medical resources, may require steroid therapy or necessitate hospitalization, outcomes that are all much worse than the known risks of existing IBD therapies. Similar to the recommendations to the general population, patients with IBD should practice strict social distancing, work from home, have meticulous hand hygiene, and separate themselves from known infected individuals. The Wuhan IBD Center experience of their 318 patients demonstrates the benefit of this approach. 21 The healthcare team there instituted immediate alerts to their population to stay at home and practice strict social distancing. Despite being in the epicenter of COVID-19 in Wuhan, none of their patients subsequently developed COVID-19. 21 Patients with IBD and their providers have expressed concerns about going to infusion centers for delivery of infusible IBD therapies (e.g. infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab). The IOIBD consensus supports ongoing use of infusion centers provided that the center had a COVID-19 screening protocol in place. Infusion centers should have a protocol that includes pre-screening of patients for exposure or symptoms of COVID-19, fever checks at the door, adequate spacing between chairs (minimum of 6 feet), masks and gloves used by providers and provided to patients, and adequate deep cleaning after patient departure. Elective switching to injectable therapies is not recommended, and a prior trial exploring this in patients receiving infliximab who were switched to adalimumab was associated with relapses. 22 In addition, switching to home infusions may seem appealing as a way to limit exposure, but this is not recommended. There are many uncontrolled variables, and there is a serious risk that a nurseprovider traveling from home to home may become infected and act as a vector to other patients.",

In addition, there are discussions about testing patients prior to endoscopic procedures or surgery, even if they have no specific symptoms to suggest COVID-19. Therefore, the situation in which a patient is known to have been infected with the virus but does not have the disease is possible and will increase. IOIBD specifically explored this scenario in development of their guidance statements. 20 In this scenario, patients should be actively moved to lower doses of prednisone (<20 mg/d) or transition to budesonide when feasible. Thiopurines, methotrexate, and tofacitinib should be temporarily held. The available monoclonal antibody therapies (anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, ustekinumab, or vedolizumab) should have their dosing delayed for 2 weeks while monitoring for development of COVID-19. The general considerations here do not readily acknowledge the half-lives of these therapies, as all of these medications may continue having systemic or tissue effects despite discontinuation. Restarting therapy after 2 weeks if the patient has not developed manifestations of COVID-19 is reasonable. It is likely that soon we will be able to perform serial testing for SARS-CoV-2 or look for disappearance of IgM and development of IgG antibodies in order to know which phase of infection the patient has entered. This will provide more precision and comfort regarding the timing of restarting any therapy that has been held. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can persist in stool longer than what is detected from nasopharyngeal swabs, it is not known whether this should be a preferred test.",

It should be known that anti-cytokine-based treatments are being studied for COVID-19 therapy, and it is possible that we will learn that, for example, continuing anti-TNF therapies might reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ system failure.
