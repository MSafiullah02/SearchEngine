            "text": "Although endogenous viruses have been classified in different ways, a useful collective term for them all that reflects their generally fragmentary nature is \u201cendogenous viral elements\u201d (EVEs) (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010). From here on, the term EVE will be used to refer to all endogenous viruses, whether derived from retroviruses, DNA viruses, or RNA viruses, although this review will generally focus on the latter group. EVEs are generated when a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) copy of the viral genome is integrated into the host germline (Figure 1\n). Although the production of dsDNA intermediates that integrate into host genomic DNA is an obligatory part of the retroviral life cycle, germline as opposed to somatic cell integration is expected to be a rare event. Despite this, endogenous retroviruses are surprisingly common; for example, approximately 5%\u20138% of the human genome is composed of endogenous retroviruses (Katzourakis and Tristem, 2005). These comprise at least 31 distinct families, such that there have been at least 31 separate integration events, and likely many more. In some animal species, it has even proven possible to see retroviral endogenization in action (Tarlinton et al., 2006). Not surprisingly, those EVEs derived from nonretroviruses are far rarer and hence represent the consequence of sporadic evolutionary events. In addition, while effectively complete genomes of endogenous retroviruses are relatively commonplace, this is not the case for those EVEs generated by other types of virus, which are usually composed of partial genomic fragments.",

            "text": "Although the presence of retroviral EVEs was described many years ago (Benveniste and Todaro, 1974, Weiss et al., 1973), the first description of a gene sequence of an RNA virus (that replicate using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) integrated into the host genome did not occur until 2004. This example involved the insect flavivirus cell fusing agent (CFA), fragments of which were found to be integrated into the genomes of Aedes spp. mosquitoes (Crochu et al., 2004), and which has also been observed in some other insect flaviviruses (Roiz et al., 2009). Shortly afterward, integrated sequences of the RNA virus Potato virus Y (PVY, a potyvirus) were found in the genomes of some grapevine varieties (Tanne and Sela, 2005). Since this time, a number of other endogenous RNA viruses have been discovered, comprising bornaviruses (also referred to as endogenous Borna-like N elements [EBLN]; Figure 2\n) (Belyi et al., 2010b, Horie et al., 2010), bunyaviruses (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010), filoviruses (Belyi et al., 2010b, Taylor et al., 2010), orthomyxoviruses (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010), reoviruses (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010), and rhabdoviruses (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010), although usually at very low copy numbers (i.e., less than 100 elements per genome). A list of animal EVEs is provided in Table 1\n, with bornaviruses being the only endogenous RNA viruses found in the human genome. Similarly, endogenous viruses have been observed in various fungal (Frank and Wolfe, 2009, Taylor and Bruenn, 2009) and bacterial (Salanoubat et al., 2002) genomes.",

For example, endogenous fragments of the Parvoviridae are found in mammalian hosts as diverse as cats, elephants, platypus, and wallabies. With the continual increase in the number of eukaryotic genome sequences, it is certain that more EVEs will be described. In addition, it is likely that the phylogenetic signal for the integration of some very ancient EVEs, particularly those that occurred early in eukaryote evolution and that evolve without functional constraints, has been lost through the accumulation of multiple nucleotide substitutions.",

            "text": "Of those EVEs recently discovered, perhaps the most surprising were the endogenous filoviruses (Figure 3\n). Although novel exogenous filoviruses have recently been discovered (Barrette et al., 2011), they generally infect a small number of mammalian species\u2014particularly primate and bat species from equatorial Africa\u2014with occasional high-profile spillovers into human populations. Indeed, there has been a long running debate as to the natural reservoir of filoviruses, with various species of fruit bat being perhaps the most likely candidate (Leroy et al., 2005). In contrast, endogenous filoviruses have been detected in the genomes of diverse mammalian taxa, including both placental and marsupial mammals (Belyi et al., 2010b, Taylor et al., 2010). While much of the evolution of these endogenous filoviruses can be measured on time scales of millions of years\u2014especially as EVEs from rat and mouse are inserted at homologous loci, strongly suggesting that they have codiverged with these species\u2014it is evident that a number of independent insertion events have occurred (Taylor et al., 2010). Most notably, those filovirus EVEs infecting placental and marsupial mammals are not sister taxa, as expected given ancient virus-host codivergence, with the EVEs from marsupials more closely related to the exogenous filoviruses. This is a remarkable observation, given the geographic separation of these two groups; most known exogenous filoviruses are of African origin, whereas the marsupial endogenous filoviruses are largely from Australian species, with a single representative found in an American opossum that constitutes the closest relative of the exogenous filoviruses (Taylor et al., 2010). Such a disjunct distribution is highly suggestive of the presence of further, currently uncharacterized, exogenous filoviruses.",

            "text": "Despite the evident under- and biased sampling of EVEs, there is a striking imbalance in the taxonomic origins of those EVEs derived from RNA viruses described to date; at the time of writing, only eight families of RNA viruses have been shown to possess endogenous relatives, five of which represent viruses with negative-sense genomes (ssRNA\u2212 viruses), and three of these falling into the Mononegavirales\u2014a higher-order grouping of multiple families of ssRNA\u2212 viruses with unsegmented genomes (Table 1). In addition, those EVEs derived from positive-sense RNA viruses (ssRNA+ viruses) are at extremely low copy number; one genomic copy in the case of the Reoviridae, five in the case of the Flaviviridae, and probably a small number in PVY. Such a bias toward ssRNA\u2212 viruses merits explanation. In the case of the bornavirus EVEs, at least part of the explanation must relate to their nuclear replication cycle, increasing the chances of endogenization (see below). Similarly, there will be an elevated chance of endogenization for those viruses that cause persistent as opposed to acute host infections. However, as ssRNA+ viruses are as likely to generate persistent infections as ssRNA\u2212 viruses, this cannot explain the extreme distribution bias. It is also possible that some EVEs are better able to achieve germline integration than others (Horie et al., 2010, Johnson, 2010), although the determinants of this process are currently unclear, nor is why it might occur more frequently with ssRNA\u2212 viruses. One possibility is that the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of ssRNA\u2212 viruses are more favorable templates for L1-mediated reverse transcription than those of other viruses (Horie et al., 2010), although why is again unclear.",

            "text": "One clue to the preponderance of ssRNA\u2212 viruses comes from the strong bias toward the integration of nucleoprotein (NP) genes (Figure 2, Figure 3). The Mononegavirales share a common genome organization, in which the NP gene has the most 3\u2032 location and the L gene, which encodes the RdRp, the most 5\u2032. In all Mononegavirales except the filoviruses genes are transcribed in a sequential manner from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 and with stepwise attenuation. This results in discrete mRNAs for each gene and means that the most 3\u2032 gene (NP) is the most abundant RNA, and the most 5\u2032 (L) gene the least abundant, and hence that whole genomes of Mononegavirales are not expected to be endogenized. That most EVEs represent NP genes also suggests that endogenization is at least in part a function of relative mRNA abundance. Indeed, many ssRNA+ viruses produce a single large polyprotein, and it may be that L1-mediated reverse transcription occurs more efficiently on the shorter mRNAs produced by ssRNA\u2212 viruses. Similarly, it is possible that the life cycle of ssRNA+ viruses, in which translation occurs before transcription, also influences mRNA abundance and hence the probability of endogenization.",

There are currently little meaningful data to determine how the first process occurs, although it is striking that endogenous bornaviruses are particularly commonplace and these are one of the few families of RNA viruses that replicate within the cell nucleus (Horie et al., 2010).",

            "text": "There are, however, a number of plausible ways in which the conversion from ssRNA to dsDNA can occur. Perhaps the most likely involves a reverse transcription step using the reverse transcriptase (RT) present in the cellular retroelements that are abundant in eukaryotic genomes. For example, long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINES) are a common component of vertebrate genomes, particularly members of the L1 family, and therefore are a potentially rich source of RT. In fact, the flanking sequences of some EBLNs possess signatures suggestive of L1-mediated reverse transcription, such as the presence of 3\u2032 poly-A tails and target site duplications (Belyi et al., 2010b, Horie et al., 2010), while the endogenous PVY elements in plants possess direct repeats and lie within a sequence itself flanked by inverted repeats (Tanne and Sela, 2005), compatible with transposable element-mediated integration. More directly, nonhomologous recombination between an exogenous RNA virus and an intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) retrotransposon has been observed to result in the reverse transcription and cellular integration of viral RNAs (Geuking et al., 2009). Alternatively, it is possible that the RT is provided by an exogenous retrovirus that is infecting the host at the same time, and particularly where this exogenous infection is associated with a high viral copy number and abundant RT. The situation is rather different for the endogenized DNA viruses. As small ssDNA viruses such as parvoviruses utilize host DNA polymerases for their replication, and therefore enter the cell nucleus, their endogenization should not come as a surprise. A similar story can be told for the endogenous hepadnaviruses, the first of which was discovered in the zebra finch and designated eZHBV (Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010) (Figure 4\n). Importantly, hepadnaviruses possess dsDNA genomes, utilize RT, replicate in the nucleus, and integrated copies are seen with the human form of the virus where they are associated with liver cancer (Bonilla Guerrero and Roberts, 2005). Although the precise mechanisms of genomic integration are unknown (Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010), hepadnaviruses clearly possess a number of the necessary attributes for endogenization. In this context, it is interesting that endogenous copies of another important agent of human cancer\u2014the papillomaviruses\u2014have yet to be discovered, even though they possess dsDNA genomes, enter the cell nucleus, and are commonplace in vertebrates (Bernard et al., 1994).",

            "text": "While there is mounting evidence for the presence of virus genetic material in host genomes, there are few examples of host genetic material integrated into the genomes of RNA and small DNA viruses, such that lateral gene transfer is largely one-way traffic. This is most likely a reflection of the extreme size constraints faced by RNA and small DNA viruses, which rarely have genomes >20,000 nt and are characterized by a lack of truly nonfunctional genomic regions. Importantly, not only do RNA and ssDNA viruses both have very small genome sizes, but they also have a relatively high mutation rate per nucleotide (Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010), such that mutational load likely limits genome size (Holmes, 2011). Accordingly, an increase in viral genome size that would follow the insertion of a host gene would result in a concomitant increase in mutational load and hence a reduction in viral fitness (Holmes, 2009). One of the few cases of RNA virus capture and maintenance of a host gene concerns the ExoN domain of coronaviruses and roniviruses, which encodes a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease. This domain shares a distant similarity with host cellular proteins of the DEDD superfamily of exonucleases that are involved in proofreading (Minskaia et al., 2006, Snijder et al., 2003), and a proofreading mechanism has recently been demonstrated in coronaviruses (Denison et al., 2011). Hence, coronaviruses and roniviruses may be able to reduce, to some extent, the high error rate normally associated with RdRp replication, in turn allowing an increase in genome size up to \u223c30,000 nt and making them the largest of all RNA viruses. In contrast, eukaryotes generally experience weaker constraints on genome size and are able to carry extra genetic material if this represents a minor fitness cost, as is often likely to be the case.",

In these cases EVEs could be selectively advantageous to the host. The most obvious selective benefit of EVEs is that they confer protection against related exogenous viruses, perhaps by triggering some aspect of the host innate immune response or, in the case of functionally intact EVE proteins, through the expression of proteins that act as immunogens. A good example is provided by the endogenous and exogenous versions of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (Arnaud et al., 2007). Protection here stems from the similar Gag proteins exhibited by the endogenous and exogenous forms of these viruses. The Gag protein from the endogenous virus interacts and coassembles with the exogenous Gag proteins, making chimeric and defective viral particles (Murcia et al., 2007). Notably, some exogenous viruses have escaped from this restriction, indicative of a virus-host evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d (Arnaud et al., 2007), and these are discussed in more detail below. However, immunity is not the only possible functional benefit for the host. Some wasp species encode genomic relatives of nudiviruses that produce virus-like particles that allow them to parasitize the larvae of lepidopterans by manipulating host responses (B\u00e9zier et al., 2009), EVEs integrated near genes may be co-opted as promoters or cis-regulatory elements (Feschotte, 2008), and the protein syncytin that is involved in the development of the human placenta is derived from the envelope protein of an endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) (Mi et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Although many of the possible evolutionary consequences of EVEs merit more-detailed investigation, their discovery has already contributed to a radical shift in our understanding of the time scale of virus evolution. As pointed about by a number of authors, the power of EVEs in this context is that they effectively represent a \u201cfossil record\u201d of past viral infections, albeit a very biased one (Emerman and Malik, 2010). The key point here is that once integrated into host genomes, EVEs cease to evolve with the very high substitution rates that characterize exogenous RNA and small DNA viruses (Holmes, 2009) and instead replicate using high-fidelity host DNA polymerases and probably experience fewer replications per unit time. This will result in a dramatic reduction in evolutionary rate, from the virus scale (usually around 10\u22123 nucleotide substitutions per site, per year) (Duffy et al., 2008) to the host scale (\u223c10\u22129 subs/site/year). If the mutational differences between endogenous viruses are known to occur after integration, such as those between duplicated EVEs, those observed between the LTRs of retroviral EVEs, or, most powerfully of all, when there is clear evidence for virus-host codivergence\u2014such as when EVEs are integrated into similar genomic positions in sister taxa, which definitively shows that they are orthologous\u2014then an evolutionary time scale can be estimated in a relatively straightforward manner using host divergence times as calibration points (Figure 1, Figure 4). However, as with all fossils, there is uncertainty about the exact timing of the evolutionary strata, particularly in cases where it is impossible to exclude the independent integration into different species. Indeed, as cross-species transmission between related hosts appears to be a major mode of exogenous RNA virus evolution (Kitchen et al., 2011), independent insertion may sometimes be difficult to exclude unless the EVEs in question occupy orthologous loci.",

Indeed, the analysis of EVEs has generally painted a radically different picture of the time scale of viral evolution than that inferred from molecular clock studies using \u201cheterochronous\u201d samples from a single virus; that is, molecular clock studies of the differences in tree branch lengths between exogenous viruses sampled at different time points during epidemiological history (Drummond et al., 2003). The best described case is that of the primate lentiviruses, a group of pathogens that includes the human (HIV) and simian (SIV) immunodeficiency viruses. Estimates of the age of primate lentiviruses based on the use of heterochronous sequences result in time scales of thousands (Sharp et al., 2001) or even hundreds (Wertheim and Worobey, 2009) of years, which are surprisingly recent given the great genetic and geographic diversity of these viruses in nonhuman primates from Africa (Hahn et al., 2000). In contrast, the presence of endogenous lentiviruses in lemurs indicates that these viruses have circulated in some primates for at least several million years (Gifford et al., 2008), while biogeographic analyses of SIV are suggestive of time scales of hundreds of thousands of years and perhaps far longer (Worobey et al., 2010). In addition, the presence of RELIK (rabbit endogenous lentivirus type K) (Katzourakis et al., 2007) elements in related lagomorph species (rabbits and hares) suggests that lentiviruses have been present in other mammalian orders for at least 12 million years (Keckesova et al., 2009, van der Loo et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Similar stories can be told for other viruses. The observation of endogenous hepadnaviruses integrated at the same genomic positions in bird species provides compelling evidence that hepadnaviruses have been in circulating in birds for at least 19 million years and perhaps as long as 40 million years (Figure 4) (Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010). Such ancient evolution sits in stark contrast to molecular clock studies of hepadnavirus evolution based on the use of contemporary avian viruses, in which evolutionary history has been measured in time scales of thousands of years (Zhou and Holmes, 2007). Similarly, the earliest integrations of bornaviruses are proposed to have occurred almost 100 million years ago (MYA) (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) and those of circoviruses at over 50 MYA (Belyi et al., 2010a, Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) (Table 1). Not only do these data describe a far older history for some viral families than previously anticipated, but such ancient virus-host codivergence sits in marked contrast to the process of recent cross-species transmission and emergence (i.e., host jumping) that characterizes many exogenous viruses. A good example is provided by the parvoviruses. While some endogenous parvoviruses have been associated with their hosts for perhaps 30 million years (Kapoor et al., 2010, Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010), these small DNA viruses represent a textbook example of recent viral emergence. In particular, it is well known that feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) jumped to dogs in the late 1970s and resulted in the pandemic spread of canine parvovirus (CPV) (Parrish, 1990) and has evolved rapidly since this time (Shackelton et al., 2005). Finally, early divergences also have been proposed for the families of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs); the origin of the HERV-A family has been proposed at between 57 and 92 MYA, that of HERV-K to between 51 and 83 MYA, and HERV-L at between 62 and 100 MYA (Katzourakis and Tristem, 2005).",

Although it has always been likely that viruses are ancient, and there is growing evidence that viruses are descendants of replicating elements that existed during a precellular world (Holmes, 2011, Koonin et al., 2006), it is perhaps surprising that some extant families of RNA virus arose so very long ago. In particular, as most exogenous RNA viruses evolve extremely rapidly, those viruses that existed millions of years ago and fossilized as EVEs would be expected to be unrecognizably divergent from their contemporary relatives, such that no meaningful multiple sequence alignment, let alone phylogenetic analysis, could be undertaken (Holmes, 2003a). However, that this is demonstrably not the case with the EVEs obtained to date (while acknowledging that more divergent EVEs might not be detected) raises the question of how ancient viruses can be so relatively well conserved in sequence. Of course, it is this sequence conservation that makes most molecular clock analyses give very recent dates of viral origin. Reconciling these profoundly different time scales for viral evolution\u2014generally recent from the analysis of contemporary viral sequences, and usually ancient from the analysis of endogenous viruses\u2014is one of the most pressing questions in studies of virus evolution and is likely to require new models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution that recognize the intricacies of viral evolution (Holmes, 2003a, Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011).",

For example, the match between host and virus phylogenies suggests that hantaviruses have codiverged with rodent species for many millions of years (Plyusnin and Morzunov, 2001). However, more recent analyses have shown that hantaviruses jump species boundaries more frequently than previously realized and possess high rates of nucleotide substitution in the short term (Ramsden et al., 2008, Ramsden et al., 2009), which suggests a far more evolutionary history. Clearly, the discovery of endogenous hantaviruses (should they exist), and particularly those where the time scale seems to match that of the rodent hosts, would go a long way to proving that hantaviruses really do have ancient ancestries.",

            "text": "EVEs may also provide some useful insights into viral macroevolution. New virus lineages are generated when viruses diverge within a single host species, for example by adapting to new cell types or following the cross-species transmission to new host species. Phylogenetic studies suggest that cross-species transmission may be the most common mechanism underlying viral speciation, although often involving jumps among closely related host species (Kitchen et al., 2011). Lineage death occurs when viruses are unable to find a sufficient number of susceptible hosts to sustain their transmission, if the infected host population suffers extinction, or because they are outcompeted by other viruses in the population. As an example of lineage death, simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are commonly found as exogenous agents in anthropoid primates, including great apes, and have seemingly codiverged with these species for more than 30 million years (Liu et al., 2008, Switzer et al., 2005), while the presence of endogenous copies suggests a far older association with placental mammals (Katzourakis et al., 2009). However, foamy viruses only appear in human populations as the result of transient spillovers from other primates. This suggests that SFV was lost from human populations during our early evolution, perhaps due to the small effective size of early human populations, which would increase the likelihood of stochastic extinction, or through the absence of the biting behavior that is central to viral transmission. Although detecting the extinction of viral lineages is a difficult task, with few genomic signatures, the presence of endogenous viruses represents the best evidence that a specific viral lineage has existed in the past (Katzourakis et al., 2009).",

Because viral infections may impose a major fitness cost on their hosts, there will also be a strong selection pressure for hosts to evolve an effective antiviral response; alleles in antiviral genes that are able to prevent or clear viral infections will have a major selective benefit and likely spread rapidly through a host population. Evidence for the strength of this selective process is the remarkable number of genes that are associated with controlling pathogen infections. There are, for example, over 220 gene loci in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (The MHC Sequencing Consortium, 1999), which exhibit considerable allelic variation, and positive selection is routinely detected in genes involved in immune responses (Yang and Bielawski, 2000). More generally, the strongly deleterious consequences of parasite infections on hosts have been touted as a possible explanation for the long-term maintenance of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes (Hamilton et al., 1990). This selective process in the host will, in turn, result in a strong selection pressure for the virus to evade these host immune responses, giving rise to an evolutionary arms race between host and virus (Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011, Sawyer et al., 2004).",

The product of the TRIM5 gene\u2014TRIM5\u03b1\u2014is a restriction factor directed against the capsid protein of retroviruses. Notably, human TRIM5\u03b1 has an elevated dN/dS on the branch after its divergence from chimpanzees, indicative of virally induced adaptive evolution in the last 6 million years or so. While this evolutionary pattern is indicative of a past retroviral induced selection, identifying the exact causative virus(es) is difficult, as will be the case in all studies of arms races based on analyses of host genomic data. Single mutations in both TRIM5\u03b1 and viral capsids can lead to important differences in the specificity of viral recognition, highlighting the intricacy of this arms race (and single, selectively advantageous, amino acid changes are usually very difficult to detect with available bioinformatic methods). As TRIM5 is able to block retroviral infection of new primate hosts, it may also play a central role in cross-species transmission and emergence (Kirmaier et al., 2010, Stremlau et al., 2004).",

If it is known when species A and B diverged, then the minimum age of the insertion event can also be estimated. See Katzourakis and Gifford (2010) for more details.

Squares of a specific color on the phylogeny indicate EVEs and the viral gene they represent. Note the bias toward integrated NP sequences. EVEs with poly-A tails are shown, while intact ORFs are marked by an \u201cO\u201d symbol and expressed genes by an \u201cX\u201d symbol. Vertical lines identify noncontiguous genes.

Estimates of divergence time are also shown in both cases; note the huge difference between the time scale of the host (millions of years) and virus (thousands of years) trees. The presence or absence of orthologous eZHBV insertions in various bird species (i.e., eZHBVI, eZHBVj, and eZHBVa) are denoted by the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d symbols, respectively, while a question mark means uncertain status. The likely phylogenetic placement of the germline integrations producing eZHBVl and eZHBVa are shown by the green lines connecting the host and virus trees. Using estimated bird host divergence times of 25 MYA and 35 MYA, it is conservatively estimated that the integration of eZHBVa and eZHBVl must have occurred at least 19 MYA, as shown by the dashed line.
