To prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases, epidemic dynamics has played an important role on investigating the transmission of infectious diseases, predicting the developing tendencies, estimating the key parameters from data published by health departments, understanding the transmission characteristics, and implementing the measures for prevention and control. In this chapter, some basic ideas of modelling the spread of infectious diseases, the main concepts of epidemic dynamics, and some developing tendencies in the study of epidemic dynamics are introduced, and some results with respect to the spread of SARS in China are given.",

It is well known that infectious diseases have been a ferocious enemy from time immemorial. The plague spread in Europe in 600 A.C., claiming the lives of about half the population of Europe (Brauer and Castillo-Chavez 2001) . Although human beings have been struggling indomitably against various infections, and many brilliant achievements earmarked in the 20th century, the road to conquering infectious diseases is still tortuous and very long. Now, about half the population of the world (6 billion people) suffer the threat of various infectious diseases. For example, in 1995, a report of World Health Organization (WHO) shows that infectious diseases were still the number one of killers for human beings, claiming the lives of 52 million people in the world, of which 17 million died of various infections within that single year (WHO). In the last three decades, some new infectious diseases (such as Lyme diseases, toxic-shock syndrome, hepatitis C, hepatitis E) emerged. Notably, AIDS emerged in 1981 and became a deadly sexually transmitted disease throughout the world, and the newest Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) erupted in China in 2002, spreading to 31 countries in less than 6 months. Both history and reality show that, while human beings are facing menace from various infectious diseases, the importance of investigating the transmission mechanism, the spread rules, and the strategy of prevention and control is increasing rapidly, and such studies ar an important mission to be tackled urgently.",

It is based largely on the specific properties of population growth, the spread rules of infectious diseases, and related social factors, serving to construct mathematical models reflecting the dynamical property of infectious diseases, to analyze the dynamical behavior qualitatively or quantitatively, and to carry out simulations. Such research results are helpful to predict the developing tendency of infectious diseases, to determine the key factors of spread of infectious diseases, and to seek the optimum strategy of preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. In contrast with classic biometrics, dynamical methods can show the transmission rules of infectious diseases from the mechanism of transmission of the disease, so that we may learn about the global dynamical behavior of transmission processes. Incorporating statistical methods and computer simulations into epidemic dynamical models could make modelling methods and theoretical analyses more realistic and reliable, enabling us to understand the spread rules of infectious diseases more thoroughly.",

They introduced a \"threshold theory\", which may determine whether the disease is epidemic or not McKendrick 1927, 1932) , and laid a foundation for the research of epidemic dynamics.

Assuming that the probability of infection by every contact is \u03b2 0 , then the function \u03b2 0 U (N ), called the adequate contact rate, shows the ability of an infected individual infecting others (depending on the environment, the toxicity of the virus or bacterium, etc.).

In those papers, they introduced a quarantined compartment, Q, and assumed that all infective individuals must pass through the quarantined compartment before going to the removed compartment or back to the susceptible compartment. Hethcote, Ma, and Liao (2002) considered more realistic cases: a part of the infectives are quarantined, whereas the others are not quarantined and enter into the susceptible compartment or into the removed compartment directly. They analyzed six SIQS and SIQR models with bilinear, standard or quarantine-adjusted incidence, and found that for the SIQR model with quarantine-adjusted incidence, the periodic solutions may arise by Hopf bifurcation, but for the other five models with disease-related death, sufficient and necessary conditions assuring the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium were obtained.",

Particularly, for the case of two patches, the conditions about the disease-free equilibrium obtained by Wang (2002) show the following: when the basic reproduction number R 12 , which is found when regarding two patches as one patch, is greater than one, the disease persists in two patches; when R 12 < 1 and R 12 \u2212 \u03a6 12 > 1 (where \u03a6 12 denotes one number minus the other number, the first number is the product of the number of new patients infected by an infected individual within the average infective course in one patch and that in another patch, the second number is the product of the number of migrated patients within the average infective course in one patch and that in another patch), the disease still persists; when R 12 < 1 and R 12 \u2212 \u03a6 12 < 1, the disease dies out in two patches. The formulation above indicates: R 12 < 1 can not ensure the extinction of the disease, and the condition R 12 \u2212 \u03a6 12 < 1 is also added. This result shows that migration among patches can affect the spread of disease. Besides those research directions mentioned above, there are some other research directions of epidemic dynamics, such as: using non-autonomous models, where the coefficients of the epidemic model are time dependent, including periodic coefficients and more general time-dependent coefficients (Lu and Chen 1998; Ma 2002) ; combining epidemic dynamics with eco-toxicology to investigate the effect of pollution on the spread of disease in a polluted environment ; combining epidemic dynamics with molecular biology to investigate the interaction among viruses, cells and medicines inside the body (De Boer et al. 1998; Lou et al. 2004a Lou et al. , 2004b Perelson et al. 1993; Wang et al. to appear; ); combining epidemic dynamics with optimal control to investigate the control strategy of epidemics (He 2000) ; considering stochastic factors to investigate the stochastic dynamics of epidemics (Jing 1990 ); and using some special disease to construct and investigate a specific model (Feng and Castillo-Chavez 2000; Hethcote and Yorke 1984) .

So, we let Since the average number of days from entering the I-compartment to moving to the D-compartment is 3 days, d id = 1 3 . On the other hand, if we assumed that the average transition times from the Q-compartment to the D-compartment, and from the Q-compartment to the S-compartment (those are misdiagnosed) are 3 days and 10 days, respectively, then by denoting the number of removed from quarantines to susceptibles and that of diagnosed from quarantines by q s and q d respectively, based on the daily reported data from MHC, we get the ratio of non-infected individuals in the Q-compartment, qs qs+q d = 0.6341.

The determination of the incidences in the free block and the isolated block is the key to analyzing the SARS model (32) . This is difficult because of the poor understanding of the SARS virus toxicities and the difficulty in quantifying these quarantines.

From the simulations above, we consider that the rapid decrease of the SARS patients can be attributed to the high successful quarantine rate and timely implementation of the quarantine measures, and indeed all of the prevention and control measures implemented in China are very necessary and effective. Zhou et al. (2004) followed the same idea of modelling the transmission of SARS in China as that presented above, and proposed a discrete model for SARS in China. However, the susceptible compartment, which includes the S-compartment and the H-compartment, was omitted in this case, because the number of susceptible individuals was extremely large compared with the number of individuals in other compartments, and some SARS patient can not contact all the population. Zhou et al. (2004) made the following assumptions: the new infected exposed is proportional to the sum kE(t) + I(t); individuals in the E-compartment move to the I-compartment and Q-compartment at the rate constant and \u03bb, respectively; individuals in the Q-compartment move to the D-compartment at the rate constant \u03c3; individuals in the I-compartment move to the D-compartment at the rate \u03b8; individuals in the D-compartment move to the R-compartment at rate constant \u03b3; d and \u03b1 are the natural death rate constant and the SARS-induced death rate constant, respectively.
