Antiviral antisepsis and disinfection are crucial for preventing the environmental spread of viral infections. Indeed, very few efficient and specific treatments are available to fight most of these infections.",

            "text": "Proper evaluation of the efficacy of antiseptics\u2010disinfectants (ATS\u2010D) on viruses is very important. Essentially, ATS\u2010D antiviral activity is evaluated by combining viruses and the product to be tested for an appropriately defined and precise contact time, neutralizing product activity, and estimating the loss of viral infectivity due to the product activity. Neutralization of the ATS\u2010D plays a key role in the test procedure; it ensures a precise contact time, the elimination of the residual activity and cytotoxicity of the tested product, and the successful recovery of viruses not killed by the product. These tests require appropriate controls, especially to check the absence of interference due to the test itself on viral infectivity, efficiency of neutralization, removal of cytotoxicity, and reproducible and well defined test conditions (e.g., contact time and environmental temperature). A germicide can be considered to have an efficient ATS\u2010D antiviral activity if it induces a log10 reduction in viral titers, in a defined contact time, higher than 3 or 4 log10, depending on American and European regulatory agencies, respectively (ASTM, 2004; AFNOR, 2007).",

            "text": "This unit describes a global methodology for evaluating ATS\u2010D activity of chemicals on viruses. The viral model used to validate this method is the human coronavirus, strain 229E (HCoV 229E), grown on L\u2010132 cells. Cultivation parameters for the cells and the viruses are described in Support Protocols 1 and 2, respectively. In the assay procedure described in the Quantitative Suspension Test for Antiviral ATS\u2010D Activity Evaluation Using Sephadex Gel\u2010Filtration Neutralization, the neutralization step is based on a gel\u2010filtration method using Sephadex columns prepared in\u2010house (Geller et al., 2009). By the process of exclusion\u2010diffusion, the column retains the small molecules of the tested germicide and releases the larger viral particles (Fig. 1), which can then be titered. An important step upstream of the virucidal assay is to ensure that viral particles are not retained by the columns and that the methodology itself does not have any influence on viral infectivity (see Support Protocol 1). It is also necessary to ensure the efficiency of the neutralization step. To verify that the tested germicide is retained by the column and thus neutralized, two approaches have been taken, a biological approach checking the absence of cytotoxicity of the filtrates (see Support Protocol 3) and a physicochemical approach, determining the retention rate of the germicide using UV\u2010visible spectrophotometry (see Support Protocol 4). Supported by these preliminary results, the ATS\u2010D virucidal assay can be performed as described in the Quantitative Suspension Test for Antiviral ATS\u2010D Activity Evaluation Using Sephadex Gel\u2010Filtration Neutralization. To plan for carrying out the Quantitative Suspension Test for Antiviral ATS\u2010D Activity Evaluation Using Sephadex Gel\u2010Filtration Neutralization, review the sequence described in Figure 2.",

Therefore, deionized water is typically used. In addition, as autoclaving can acidify the water, the pH must be checked after autoclaving and the water neutralized, if necessary, by the addition of 7.5% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Hard water can be used, but if it is, the hardness should be precisely measured and specified. Indeed, hard water is recommended by some standards because it is more representative of conditions in the actual use of the product. However, deionized water allows easier assay standardization. Furthermore, autoclaving can induce an acidification of the water, so the pH must be checked. Indeed, pH\u2010induced variability in virus infectivity has been demonstrated with coronaviruses (Sturman et al., 1990).",

One major concern is the neutralization step. Neutralization can be achieved by different methods. The most common and simplest method proposed in most of the standards is dilution. However, this presents two major disadvantages: (1) the toxicity of many chemicals cannot be neutralized by a 1/10 or even a 1/100 dilution, and (2) only a few viruses can be grown at enough high titers to support such dilutions. Thus, other neutralization methods must be considered. Chemical neutralization offers the advantage of stopping the activity of the tested germicide at a precise time point, ensuring a consistent contact time. Unfortunately, it is restricted to specific chemicals, e.g., neutralization of aldehyde functions by glycine. Another solution, the one developed in this unit, is the gel\u2010filtration method. Many variations can be envisaged, e.g., the type of the gel chosen. European and American standards propose, as well, different substitutive methods (AFNOR, 2007; ASTM, 2004). This last technique offers the possibility of neutralizing a large range of molecules, independently of their functional groups and without extra dilution. However, some drawbacks persist, e.g., difficulty in retaining the smallest molecules such as alcohols, which are widely used as ATS\u2010D.",
