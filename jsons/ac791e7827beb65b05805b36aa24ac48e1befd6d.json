The primary aim of the present study was to develop two degenerated TaqMan real-time quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) for detection of a broad range of bacterial DNA that specifically detect 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (862 and 241 bp) and evaluate the efficiency of the Bellco Selecta resin to capture the BDNAs in the dialysis fluid. For this purpose, we decided to compare measurements of unfragmented samples (9.8 \u00d7 10 5 Escherichia coli genome) with artificially fragmented DNA samples. We assessed two broad-range real-time PCR targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes for detection of fragmented and unfragmented bacterial DNA in the dialytic fluid and demonstrated that Bellco Selecta resin is capable of retaining these types of bacterial DNA.",

Consequently, the purity of the dialysate and the permeability of the membrane for dialysate impurities might give in part to the acute and long-term complications that afflict hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis filtration with online endogenous reinfusion (HFR treatment) is a dialytic technique, which uses a double stage filter. The first stage allows pure ultrafiltrate (UF; a plasmatic water rich in toxins) to flow through a sorbent resin cartridge (Selecta). The cartridge removes toxins but not albumin and other nutritive substances, then the blood and regenerated UF undergo traditional dialysis. We investigate if the resin contained in the Selecta cartridge is able to remove bacterial-derived DNA fragments (BDNAs).",

The Primer Express Software provided by Life Technologies (Waltham, MA, USA) was of limited value in determining a universal primers set as the primary selection criterion of the software is the length of the amplicon (50 \u00b1 150 bp). As a result, the regions of identity within the 16S rDNA had to be assessed manually, with the Primer Express Software being limited to checking for melting temperature (T m ), primer dimer or internal hairpin configurations, and percentage G--C values within possible primer-probe sets. The forward primer (all-BACT F2) and universal probe used was previously report by Nadkarni et al. [5] . The final chosen set including the primers is reported in Table 1 . The primers and probe set give two amplicons of 241 bp (fragment 1) and 862 bp (fragment 2), respectively, exceeding the 50-150 bp that was recommended. The universal probe and primers were checked for possible cross-hybridization with bacterial genes other than 16S rDNA as well as genes from Eucarya and Archaea using the database similarity search program blast (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). However, the universal primers did not amplify the human DNA sample thus confirming the specificity of the probe and primers set for the 16S rDNA of the domain bacteria.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the Bellco Selecta resin to capture the bacteriafree DNA fragmented or unfragmented eventually presented in the dialysis fluid. For this purpose, we developed two PCRs for real-time detection of all bacteria DNA, the first able to amplify a fragment of 241 bp and the second of 862 bp. Both PCRs were designed on 16S rDNA. Real-time PCR assays are described as \"closed\" systems, since no postamplification manipulation of the amplicon is required. The advantages of these systems, in comparison to conventional PCR, include a reduced turnaround time, minimizing of the potential for carryover contamination and the ability to analyze closely the assay performance. Real-time PCR offers significant improvements to quantitation because of its wide dynamic range, which can accommodate at least eight log 10 copies of nucleic acid template. This is made possible because the data are chosen from the linear phase of amplification where conditions are optimal, rather than the end point where the final amount of amplicon may have been affected by inhibitors, poorly optimized reaction conditions, or",

The development of a noncommercial real-time PCR assay [homemade] requires an analogous process applied to a marked and approved commercial kit for diagnostic use [9, 10] . This is realized by the standardization and optimization of amplification protocol. The sensitivity of our two assays was found to be 10 2 copies/reaction with a linearity ranging from 10 9 to 10 2 copies/reaction, characterized by a good efficiency and repeatability (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the method was accurate, precise, and reproducible (Table 2) in accordance with Karlen et al. [11] . Interexperiment biological variability will be specific to each experimental system. The true variability of the PCR assay (intraassay and biological interassay variability) is higher, typically with overall CV values ranging around 30%-50% [11] . We obtained a maximum of 3.18% in the interassay test, so then we could say that our assay was reproducible.",

The limitations of this study are the size of the detectable bacteria-free DNA. BDNA oligodeoxynucleotides of 6-20 nucleotides are able to bind to toll-like receptors and are stimulatory on immune cells [16] . They induce natural killer cell activity and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3 ), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-6 release from mononuclear cells (1 [16] [17] [18] [19] ); they also display these same abilities when composed of five to six nucleotides [19] . The assay performed up to 241 bp detection but not less. In conclusion, the present study shows that the development of two real-time PCR systems able to detect bacteria-free DNA and the use of this assay on the dialyzed fluid. Also, we assessed two broad-range realtime PCR targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes for detection of fragmented and unfragmented bacterial DNA in the dialytic fluid and demonstrated that Bellco Selecta resin is capable of retaining these types of bacterial DNA. Future studies will need to develop an assay able to detect a small DNA fragment up to 20 bp such as stem-loop PCR already developed for detection of microRNA [20] .",
