The unit was originally located at the Houphou\u00ebt\u2013Boigny Hospital. When this hospital closed by the end of 2000, the unit moved to the North Hospital, which is located however, near the previous one. The North Hospital is an 800-bed university-affiliated teaching hospital, and the Tropical Diseases Unit is currently the reference center for tropical diseases in Marseilles, southern France. Only adults and children older than 15 years old are hospitalized in this unit. Younger children are hospitalized in the pediatric unit.4 Data were collected prospectively in medical records, and included a standard questionnaire completed by medical students and attending physicians. Patients were included in the study if they were hospitalized with fever during the study period, and had a history of travel and/or residence in a tropical country in the 6 months prior to admission or claimed that their symptoms were related to a travel with no limit of time. All investigations were ordered at the discretion of the attending physician. However, in 2002 a systematic procedure for laboratory investigation was used for all patients (C. Foucault, unpublished). The benefit of such a procedure will be discussed elsewhere.",

Furthermore, febrile patients who returned from the Comoros archipelago or the African mainland were significantly more likely to present with malaria. This is attributed to the fact that the majority of our patients are migrants (59.4%), and that most of the migrants originated from Comoros Islands (84%), and less frequently Western Africa (9%). Indeed, in recent years, a growing proportion of imported malaria has been seen in migrants, both in Europe and America .13 These migrants include newcomers and refugees, but even more frequently residents who return to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR). In a recent review of reports describing more than 250 cases and published between 1991 and 2001, the proportion of migrants in malaria cases in Europe varied from 33% in the United Kingdom to 60% in Italy and 86% in France 14. Interestingly, this last study was conducted in our hospital, in the paediatrics unit.15 On pooling the reports, 43% of the cases registered in major European centre occurred in migrants and VFRs make up the dominant group.14\n",

The first started before 1970 and the second followed the independence of the three islands after 1975. In Marseilles, the population of people originating from Comoros has been estimated at 50,000\u201370,000 inhabitants, although the precise number is difficult to assess.

Only one patient (0.33%) took an adequate regimen (mefloquine) regularly during and after the trip as currently recommended by the French health authorities 18. However, drug levels were not measured to confirm the claim of this patient. The poor compliance to malaria chemoprophylaxis in migrants returning to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives corroborates with other reports in the literature 13, 14. The reasons for poor compliance include the lack of information, as well as the misconception in continued immunity against malaria because of birth in Comoros, and the relatively high cost of the drugs recommended for chemoprophylaxis. As discussed recently, an improved approach to educate the Comorian population in Marseilles regarding malaria risks and prophylaxis needs to be explored and include the contribution of social and medical anthropology 17.",

Among the studies analyzed in this review, one had been performed prospectively among 104 young long-term travelers (at least 3 months) from Israel to various endemic areas 23. Dengue seroconversion was reported in 6.7% of all travelers with a median of 5.3 months' stay abroad; four travelers (3.8%) had immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies, all after a trip to Southeast Asia; three out of seven infection were asymptomatic 23. Another prospective study conducted in a cohort of Dutch short-term travellers to endemic areas in Asia during 1991\u201392 included collection of sera before and after travel 24. The authors reported an incidence rate of probable infection (IgM seroconversion or a fourfold rise in IgG ratio in the absence of cross-reaction with antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus) of 30/1000 persons/months, with a clinical/subclinical ratio of 1:3.3 24. Higher incidence rates have been reported during epidemics. In August 1995, a dengue virus outbreak among participants in a community-assistance program in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, Caribbean, resulted in an attack rate was reaching 69% 25. Non-Caucasian travellers may have a higher risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever than Caucasian travellers 21. Finally, the role of travelers to introduce more virulent strains (subtypes) into areas where only mild disease had been observed (such as Sri Lanka), or to introduce the virus to non-endemic areas where the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti is prevalent, has been recently discussed 21.",

Gastroenteritis was the second leading cause of fever in most of the studies recently reviewed 3. In febrile patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can be caused by bacteria responsible for invasion of the mucosal lining of the intestines, including Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., as observed in our patients. Fever is uncommon in E. histolitica infections, with the exception of hepatic amebiasis, as reported here. Of significance is the fact that S. typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, is the leading etiologic agent responsible for food- and water-borne infections in our patients. None of the patients had been given typhoid vaccine. Antinori et al. noted a similar trend 3. Typhoid fever is diagnosed with an incidence rate of 30/100,000 per month among travelers to the Indian subcontinent, North and West Africa (except Tunisia) and Peru. Elsewhere this rate has been estimated to be 10-fold lower 26. Tourists as well as VFRs are affected 26.

Children born to migrants living in France and travelling back to the family's country of origin are particularly vulnerable. The Asian and African region bordering the Mediterranean and the Caribbean have been classified as destinations with moderate to high risk of infection by WHO 26. Currently, the efficacy of hepatitis A vaccination is close to 100% 29. In France, the vaccine is now recommended in unimmunized adults and children over the age of one year traveling to endemic areas, and more generally for all travelers to all countries with poor sanitation level. Serologic testing prior to vaccination is recommended only for persons born before 1945, for those residing in medium-high endemic areas, and those with a medical history of jaundice 18. In Switzerland, the \u2018universal travel strategy\u2019 for hepatitis A vaccination was associated with a 9-year reduction rate of 54% 29.",

Half of these patients were hospitalized in 2003 after returning from Southeast Asia to exclude the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 33. The SARS outbreak has recently focused global attention on respiratory tract infection in returned travellers 34. In early 2003, the Geosentinel Surveillance Network published a review of respiratory tract infections in travellers recorded in their database by 25 globally dispersed sentinel clinics from September 1997 through August 2001. Among 21,960 entries, respiratory tract infections accounted for 7.8% of all infections and included various respiratory diagnosis 35. These data highlighted the susceptibility of travelers to infectious respiratory pathogens even before the SARS epidemic. Possible respiratory problems included viral upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, viral and bacteria pneumonia, followed by uncommon or more \u2018exotic\u2019 causes 2. More recently, the medical records of travelers who had returned with pneumonia and who had been hospitalized in Paris in a French Hospital from August 2001 to July 2002, were reviewed 36. A total of 17 patients were studied. The authors reported a high rate of etiologic diagnosis (76.5%), that they explain by their inclusion criteria, \u2018severe disease or unexplained cause\u2019 36. They reported L. pneumophila and M. pneumoniae, as reported in our study3. They also diagnosed Streptococcus pneumoniae, Leptospira sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Schistosomia sp. as well as agents that were in our study responsible for syndromes other than respiratory infections, such as Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and dengue virus 36. Although Legionnaire's disease is now recognized as a relatively common cause of pneumonia in travelers, particularly after sea cruises 37, most of the causes of respiratory tract infections in travelers are not identified, particularly when patients are not hospitalized. A systematic procedure for laboratory investigation is on going for all patients admitted in our unit. The benefit of such a procedure to diagnose respiratory tract infections will be evaluated in the upcoming months.",

A second case was associated with falciparum malaria in a patient returning from Comoros. It should be remembered that Q fever may present with isolated fever 44. Furthermore, a recent review found 400 cases of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses in international travellers, the vast majority being African tick bite fever caused by R. africae and Mediterranean spotted fever caused by R. conorii\n45. The present study reported only two cases because most of our patients with tick-borne rickettsioses are seen as outpatients; however, these cases were sufficiently severe to require hospitalisation. One case was reported as the first serologically documented case of Indian tick typhus in a returned traveler 46. Our study did not detect any flea-borne murine typhus due to R. typhi, or scrub typhus due to Orientia tsutsugamushi transmitted by chiggers, although these diseases are potential causes of fever in returned travelers 47, 48.

Malaria was shown to be by far the most frequent cause of fever. Migrants who visited friends and relatives in their country of origin appeared to be at high risk, as shown in other recent studies. Our study highlights the need to adapt travel advices and chemoprophylaxis to the community of migrants. In our city, it includes a large proportion of people originated from the Comoros archipelago. Thus, our data may not be representative for other centers in Europe or anywhere. However, these centers may face similar situation with others specific communities of migrants. Finally, although we have identified here emerging diseases, 8.2% of the fevers remained unexplained. An improved approach to diagnosis may allow for the discovery of new diseases in travelers in the future.",
