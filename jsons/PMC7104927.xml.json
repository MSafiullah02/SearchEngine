Both zoonotic introductions and human-to-human transmissions are responsible for new infections. Dromedary camels have been found to be intermediary hosts for the virus and may represent the source for zoonotic infection (Muller et al., 2015, Alagaili et al., 2014). Human-to-human transmission can occur following close and prolonged contacts and it has been identified as the main mechanism responsible for the documented hospital outbreaks of Al-Hasa (Assiri et al., 2013) and Jeddah (Drosten et al., 2015). Modelling studies highlighted the subcritical nature of the epidemic (Chowell et al., 2014, Poletto et al., 2014, Breban et al., 2013, Cauchemez et al., 2014, Majumder et al., 2014) and few of them also characterised the rate of zoonotic transmission (Poletto et al., 2014, Cauchemez et al., 2014). A population-based serological investigation recently provided evidence for substantial under-detection of cases possibly due to sub-clinical forms of the disease (Muller et al., 2015).",

Geographical variation in the epidemic has rarely been considered in these studies, even though epidemic data show a clear spatial heterogeneity across countries in the Middle East region and across provinces of Saudi Arabia. Occasional sparks in activity have been observed as well. A particularly large increase in the number of cases was reported during Spring 2014, with a maximum of 133 weekly cases at the end of April (epidemiological week 2014-17), confined mainly in the provinces of Riyadh and Makkah in Saudi Arabia (WHO).",

Whether this behaviour results from a combination of different transmission modes or seasonal effects or other mechanisms is still unclear. Here we aim to quantify the spreading potential associated to zoonotic and human-to-human transmission routes and characterise their temporal and geographical variation, to uncover possible variations in the epidemiology of the disease. We propose a combined approach, akin to the one introduced in (Poletto et al., 2014), based on the joint analysis of imported cases out of the Middle East region and incidence of cases within the region. By maximising the use of available information the model is able to estimate the transmission parameters for each route and their spatiotemporal variation, account for unidentified human-to-human transmission among detected case, and assess the rate of case detection.",

Indeed, human-to-human transmission was reported in 34% of the cases, but the best-fit model predicted that this proportion was up to 75%. Not accounting for the imperfect information on secondary cases led to under-estimating human-to-human transmission. Interestingly, this larger proportion of human-to-human transmission predicted by the best-fit model is consistent with the fact that only few contacts between known sources of zoonotic transmission, such as dromedary camels, and humans have been reported among MERS-CoV patients (Gossner et al., 2014) and often no such contacts were found for infections reported as primary. Our results show that a large part of human-to-human transmission may have went unidentified in the data, as previously suggested (Drosten et al., 2015). The proportion of unidentified human-to-human transmission was the largest when epidemic activity increased, which could be explained by the more difficult assessment of the origin of cases in presence of a large number of cases. Indeed, while in the reported data the proportion of secondary cases did not change substantially during the Spring 2014 period compared to the rest of the time (34% vs. 33%), our model showed that this percentage increased from 52% to 74% in Spring 2014. This sharp increase has previously been described in an observational study and attributed mainly to nosocomial transmissions (Drosten et al., 2015). The predicted value in the low activity period (52%) is similar to the value reported for the period between September 2012 and October 2013 (59%) (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013).",

            "text": "Our analysis provided further insight in the Spring 2014 increase. We found that this epidemic wave required a substantial increase in both the rate of introduction of the virus and human-to-human transmission. We obtained indeed a rise of a factor 17 in the rate of sporadic introductions, and a three times increase in the reproductive ratio going from values below the epidemic threshold (in accordance with previous studies (Poletto et al., 2014, Breban et al., 2013, Cauchemez et al., 2014)) to values above such threshold for all the regions. More frequent sporadic introductions could be related to an increase in the virus circulation in the zoonotic source. A recent study (Wernery et al., 2015) on MERS-CoV spread among dromedary camels shows that the virus produces acute epidemics in calves, often born in Spring. Such outbreaks may cause an increase in the number of primary cases and increased opportunities for subsequent transmission, multiplying the number of admissions of MERS-CoV cases to hospitals with the possibility of further triggering hospital outbreaks as previously reported (Drosten et al., 2015, Saad et al., 2014, Oboho et al., 2015). Despite a suggestion that the highly seasonal breeding cycle of camels may drive MERS-CoV infections in humans (Wernery et al., 2015), we did not find evidence to explain a seasonal pattern on human-to-human transmission. We tested seasonal patterns for q\nsp(t) and R(t) to examine if there had been a rise in the number of cases during Spring 2013. Overall, the model fits were not improved (see Supplementary Information). However, this does not rule out that such a seasonal pattern may become more apparent as the number of cases increases. Sensitivity analysis on five alternative models showed that posterior distribution of parameters were little affected by the model details.",

On the other hand, zoonotic transmission presented a highest level of heterogeneity. This result points out the strong environmental component of the infection. Such variations indeed should be related to a spatially heterogeneous force of infection induced by the zoonotic source. Recent studies provided information on spatial density of camels over the Arabian Peninsula (Gossner et al., 2014) and the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection among the animals (Alagaili et al., 2014). Besides these two ingredients, however, the force of infection from camels to human is also determined by human-to-camel contact behaviour. Information on farming practices and their geographical variation would be critical to explain the observed pattern and to inform risk assessment analysis.",

Here, we found that the reported cases amounted to between 16% and 52% of all cases, so that the total epidemic size in the Middle East region as of now could range between \u223c2500 and \u223c8000 cases. Cases could go undetected because they are subclinical (Muller et al., 2015, Saad et al., 2014, Oboho et al., 2015, Memish et al., 2013, Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2014).

Most published analyses of the MERS-CoV epidemics focused on the characteristics of case cluster sizes to inform human-to-human transmission (Poletto et al., 2014, Breban et al., 2013, Cauchemez et al., 2014), and would not be adequate to analyse sustained human-to-human transmission. A more recent analysis used trajectory matching based on a deterministic SEIR model (Chowell et al., 2014) that may result in larger inaccuracies for small counts. To overcome these two limitations, we formulated a stochastic birth and death process combining the occurrence of sporadic cases and their offsprings, extending methods for the estimation of reproduction numbers based on secondary cases only to include also sporadic cases (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004). To simplify the analysis, we considered cases over intervals of the same duration as the mean generation time, but extension to arbitrary generation time distribution is straightforward. We also assumed Poisson variability in incidence, but allowed for over-dispersion by introducing region specific parameters.",

This may be unrealistic, especially across different countries due to the different surveillance systems. We believe, however, that the assumption of uniform detection rate across the provinces of Saudi Arabia is justified by the national surveillance system and consequently the geographical signature predicted by the model within the region is likely to be genuine. We assumed \u03c1 to be also constant in time. Such assumption was made in other studies referring to the period before Spring 2014 (Chowell et al., 2014); this was justified by the fact that pro-active surveillance was put in place during that period (Memish et al., 2014). The sharp increase in cases during Spring 2014 may have caused an overload in surveillance systems and a decrease in the detection probability. If this is the case, the increase in the zoonotic transmission during the period could be higher than the results provided here. It is important to note, however, that given the model assumptions such bias does not affect the estimated ratio between primary and secondary cases nor the reproductive ratio.",

Applied to MERS-CoV, the model showed that human-to-human transmission is more frequent than expected and high geographical heterogeneity and temporal variation characterise the zoonotic insurgence of cases with bursts that have the potential to trigger outbreaks with intense human-to-human transmission. As such, priority should be given to the control of the zoonotic transmission with a better assessment of the mechanisms at the origin of the observed variation in the generation of cases.",
