The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to generate mild as well as critical courses. Complications on the intensive care units include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac, and kidney injury as well as shock. Here, we present the first case report of a successful treatment of a COVID-19 patient presenting with adult respiratory distress syndrome plus refractory combined cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock, which could be successfully stabilized after implantation of a percutaneous ventricular assist device plus an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although such intense treatment might not be feasible in case of a health care disaster as described for the hot spots of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might encourage treatment of younger patients on intensive care units not overcrowded by critically ill patients.

A recent meta-analysis reports mortality to be as high as 13.9% in all patients with highest mortality in older patients. 1 Although the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most common trigger for intensive care unit (ICU) admission (incidence 32.8%), cardiac injury and shock are frequent (incidence 13.0% and 6.2%, respectively). 1 Although these numbers derive from an all-comer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) collective, hemodynamic complications might be far more frequent in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission. To this date, there is insufficient data in order to comment on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hemodynamic complication like shock.",

This made our patient a good candidate for mechanical support devices which are dependent on venous or ventricular drainage. Importantly, as the ARDS still persists, the prognosis is now driven by the potential pulmonary recovery. We do not have sufficient data on this very sick patient collective in order safely estimate prognosis. At least in our patient, the shock could be overcome using a combination of two mechanical support devices.
