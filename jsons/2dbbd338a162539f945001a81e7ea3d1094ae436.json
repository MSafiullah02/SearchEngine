We estimated the infection rate and the initial infecting individuals of COVID-19 by using the officially reported data at the early stage of the epidemic for the susceptible (S), infectable (I), quarantined (Q), and confirmed recovered (R k ) population model, so called SIQR k model. In the officially reported data we know the quarantined cases and the official reported recovered cases. We can't know the recovered cases from the asymptomatic cases. In the SIQR k model we can estimated the parameters and the initial infecting cases (confirmed cases + asymptomatic cases) from data fits. We obtained the infection rate in the range = 0.233~0.462 , the basic 2 reproduction number = 1.8~3.5, and the initial number of infected individuals (0) = 10~8409 for some selected countries. By using fitting parameters we estimated that maximum time of the infection is around 50 days in Germany when the government are performing the quarantine policy. The disease is undergoing to a calm state about 6 months after the first patients were found.",

The average incubation time is about 5 days [12, 13] and the duration of the milder cases of disease is about 5~6 days [14] . The average time of duration from infection to recovery or death of non-isolated cases are about 10 days, corresponding to a rate of 0.1/day [11] . Therefore, we obtain the rates as = (1 \u2212 ) \u00d7 0.1/day and = \u00d7 0.2/day. Finally, we obtain the parameters as = = 0.067/day. Using these parameters and the fitting parameter and , we obtain the parameter and (0) from the fitting parameters and the predetermined rates. We summarized the results obtained from the data of each countries. We estimated the infection rate and the initial number of the infected individuals (0).

On January 11, 2020, China reported the first death by the coronavirus [1]. The victim was as 61-year old man in Wuhan. On January 20, 2020, a WHO reported the first confirmed cases outside China in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea [1]. The disease was spreading rapidly at Wuhan City and the cases were reported in outside Wuhan City. On 23 January 2020, China placed Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, under quarantine orders. All transportation departures were cancelled and suspended [1]. The president of WHO had declared the pandemic of COVID-19 in March 11, 2020.

The SIQR model includes a rate that quantifies the recovering of asymptomatic individuals for the evolution equation of the infection and recovering population. Peng et al introduced epidemic model of COVID-19 including the exposed population. Their model is called generalized SEIR model [10]. They introduced the time dependent parameters such as mortality rate and protection rate. Carcione et al reported the simulation results of the COVID-19 epidemic by the SEIR model [11]. They applied the model to the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy. They estimated the basic reproduction number = 2.6 in early stage of the outbreak. Fanelli and Piazza analyze and forecast the COVID-19 spreading by the SIRD model in China, Italy and France [8]. Padersen and Meneghini quantified the undetected COVID-19 cases and effects of containment measure in Italy. They introduced SIQR model [12] which include the rate for a patient to become non-infectious. In this article we consider the SIQR K model based on only known data for the active cases and the recovered cases. We estimated the parameters of the model from the data of the reported cases for some selected countries. We obtained the infection rate and the initial number of the infected individuals. From the fitting parameters we estimated the basis reproduction number. We predict the maximum time of the infection and the annihilating period of the disease. 4 II. Epidemic Model We consider an epidemic model of COVID-19 which is characterized by the variables { ( ), ( ), ( ), ( )} denoting the susceptible population, infected population, quarantined population, and recovered population at time . The total number of the population is satisfied a constraint = ( ) + ( ) + ( ) + ( ) where is the total number of the population. Let us define the recovered population as ( ) = ( ) + ( ) where ( ) is known or confirmed recovered populations who are reported officially and ( ) is the unknown or asymptomatic recovered populations who are infected, but do not show any symptoms.

The first confirmed time for the virus in China was required for a long time because this disease is a new type of the Coronavirus. For the USA case the initial infecting people is small value as (0) = 17. In US the first patient was found on the state of Washington. However, the late inspection and the delayed quarantine policy by the CDC and the federal government are inducing the huge outbreak in the USA. The South Korea is one of the excellent controlled countries for this disease. In early stage of the outbreak, the initial cases are estimated as (0) = 1356. In South Korea a super-spreader was found at a metropolitan city, Daegu, in Feb. 17, 2020 who attended worships of a church gathering a lot of people. Although the initial infecting people are very big, the Health Organization and Korean CDC are performing the wide range of the inspection, strong policy of the quarantine, and providing the information of the contacting people of the confirmed patient. These strong protecting policies can be preventing the wide spreading of the disease up to now in South Korea. Prediction of the susceptible (S), infecting (I), quarantined (Q), and confirmed recovered (R k ) individuals by the numerical integration using the fitting parameters for Germany. The disease is lasting for 200days after the first occurrence of the patient. We calculate numerically the SIQR K model by using the fitting parameters for the countries. Fig. 2 shows the predicted cases of the susceptible (S), infecting (I), quarantined (Q), and officially confirmed recovered (R k ) individuals for Germany. The maximum of the infecting people is around 50days when the government are enforcing the quarantine of the infecting person. Of course, the maximum time and the lasting time of the disease depend on the fitting parameters and the initial infecting people. For Germany, the disease is in the calm state after 200days. We require about 6 months to terminate the disease according to our model.
