Repeated experiences of pain in the neonatal period can cause altered cortical development and pain processing, such as decreased pain threshold, hyperalgesia, and allodynia [1\u20134]. Preterm babies are exposed to a variety of painful experiences during their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. Screening for ROP is one such procedure, where neonates show both immediate pain behavior and prolonged physiologic arousal [5]. During eye examinations, babies display well-defined pain responses [6].",

All the neonates included in the trial were eligible for ROP screening as per National Neonatology Forum (NNF) guidelines. Babies who were (1) nil by mouth, (2) had congenital malformation, (3) on a mechanical ventilator and (4) those who were on concurrent analgesic medication were excluded from the study. Forty-five neonates were randomized into three groups, who received either 10% dextrose, expressed breast milk or sterile water. Randomization was performed using computer-generated random numbers. Stratification of cases was done for weight < 1250 g and \u2265 1250 g at the time of enrollment. Babies with weight less than 1250 g received 2 ml and babies with weight more than 1250 g received 5 ml of either breast milk, 10% dextrose solution or sterile water one minute before the start of the examination as depicted in Fig. 1. Allocation concealment was done by storing the randomized group numbers in sealed opaque envelopes which were opened just before administration of intervention. The study solutions were prepared by members of the staff who were otherwise not involved with the study. Expressed breast milk was collected for all the babies in a sterile container before the start of the examination. Mydriatics used were cyclopentolate 0.5% and phenylephrine 2.5% one drop in each eye, repeated three times every 10 min. Infants also received the topical anesthetic proparacaine just before the eye examination. Eye examinations were carried out by an experienced ophthalmologist. Approval from the ethical committee of the hospital where the study was conducted was taken before initiating the study and written parental consent was obtained. Demographic details and baseline characteristics were recorded on a pre-designed proforma. Pain was assessed by Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score. This score incorporates maximum heart rate, minimum oxygen saturation, gestational age and three facial reactions\u2014the presence of nasolabial furrow, brow bulge and eye squeeze. It was graded as mild (<6), moderate (6\u201312) and severe (>12) [20].",

Though sucrose is a widely studied agent for analgesia in newborns, authors used dextrose because sterile dextrose solution was readily available than sucrose solution. Further, oral dextrose is safe and has also been found to reduce pain perception in newborns undergoing painful procedures [21, 22]. Among the analgesics studied for neonatal pain, breastfeeding/breast milk is a natural, easily available, easy to use and potentially risk-free intervention. The potential mechanisms by which breast milk might provide an analgesic effect is the presence of lactose in breast milk [23]. Breast milk contains a higher concentration of tryptophan, a precursor of melatonin. Melatonin is shown to increase the concentration of beta-endorphins and could be one of the mechanisms for the nociceptive effects of breast milk [24].",

Rosali et al. concluded that the group receiving EBM had significantly lower PIPP score of 12.7(1.69) vs. 15.5(1.78) in the control group [19]. Taplak compared sucrose, breast milk and distilled water for reducing pain during ROP screening. They found that breast milk group had better recovery from pain after the procedure [18]. The present study scored the pain only during the procedure. Ribeiro et al. evaluated breast milk and sucrose for pain relief during retinal eye examinations and concluded that they have similar analgesic effects [17].",

A recent meta-analysis, which included twenty-nine studies (N = 1487), compared the benefits of various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions used for pain management during ROP screening [9]. It was concluded that topical anesthetic (TA) combined with a sweet taste and an adjunct intervention (e.g., non-nutritive sucking) had the highest probability of being the optimal treatment vs. TA alone. However, absolute scores suggested that no pain treatment was effective in absolute terms (i.e., 62% of trial arms had mean scores >12). Of trials included in this review, the lowest absolute scores were observed in a unit that does not use a speculum [29] and the only study in which the authors assessed the effect of speculum on pain found evidence to support avoiding its use [30].",
