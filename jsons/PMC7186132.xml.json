Suspicion of COVID-19 would be high in patients with fever, typical imaging features and contact history. Two case\u2013control cohort studies found that for the factors associated with severity certain clinical characteristics and laboratory results differed between hospitalized patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and those not in ICU [6,2], suggesting that these characteristics might be used as predictors for the severity. Previous investigations into severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) reported the number of involved lung segments might be used as a predictor [7,8], which indicates that quantitative imaging might also be used as a method to assess severity. As quantitative computer tomography (CT) using a deep learning algorithm might have better performance and efficiency than the traditional semi-quantitative method based on visual score, in this study we intend to explore whether the quantitative method could have potential in assessing the severity of the COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.",

A multi-scale convolutional neural networks was designed to segment both lung and lung infected regions from thin-section chest CT images. During the training stage, a set of CT images of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were collected, and the infected regions were manually delineated by experienced thoracic radiologists. Based on these labeled data, a multi-scale neural network model was trained for the segmentation task. In the application step, the learned model was used to automatically extract lung regions (both lung lobes and segments) and infected regions [12]. A quantitative analysis procedure was performed based on the segmentation results, and the value range of \u2212750 HU to \u2212300 HU and \u2212300 HU to 50 HU was defined as GGO and consolidation, respectively [13,14].

The lymphocyte decreased in 16 cases, which suggests that COVID-19 shares characteristics with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus can prohibit the cellular immune function by consuming a great deal of immune cells and finally lead to exacerbation of the patients [1,16]. Therefore, the lymphocyte count could be used as a predictor for the severity of the infectious disease. The CRP and ESR elevated in 20 and 18 cases, although they were not specific indexes of infection, the continuously increased level might indicate the co-infections with some other kinds of bacteria and fungi, and the on course of deterioration of the disease. The LDH level increased in half of our cases, which might own to the cardiac and hepatic injury. The LDH reported in critically ill patients was higher than that in the non-critically ill patients [2,6], indicating increased LDH might be a predictive index among the hospitalized patients. The serum potassium slightly decreased in 18 cases, which might due to the increased angiotensin \u2161 leading to the aldosterone secretion from adrenal cortex, and the increased angiotensin \u2161 was found to have a correlation with the severity of the lung infection [17,18]. The total or partial quantitative parameters positively correlated with CRP, ESR and LDH, and negatively correlated with lymphocyte, which implies that the quantification from the baseline chest CT is in accordance with the possible pathophysiological change of the COVID-19 and might be used as a biomarker for assessing the severity of the disease.",

We used PSI as a control to test the potential of the quantitative CT in assessment of the severity and found a tendency of a slight positive correlation between the proportion of total infection and the PSI score although there was no significantly statistical difference. The imbalanced proportion of cases in our study may be the reason for this. Of the 30 patients, 16 were in PSI grade \u2160, and there was no specific score for these cases. Furthermore, only 2 cases were in PSI grade \u2162 and 1 case in PSI grade \u2163. Therefore, a more balanced proportional study is warranted in the future. Although the proportion of GGO or consolidation had no correlation with the PCI score, statistically. We should interpret this with caution that these two imaging features stand for different pathological courses, are the manifestations of infection and lung injury, and their dynamic changes might be possible predictors for the prognosis during the follow-up, which needs to be further explored in the following work.",

Making a prediction for critically ill patients would be of greater significance. There is, therefore, an urgent need to test this quantitative method in future studies with longitudinal observations in a relatively balanced proportion of cases.
