            "text": "Peter Ball, MB, ChB (CHEST 1995; 108:43S-52S) The term \"chronic bronchitis\" appears to have been . introduced in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century to describe chronic bronchial mucosal inflammation. 1 The British population continues to suffer one of the highest mortality rates from chronic bronchitis in Europe, and in the 1960s, as many as 17% of adult men were thought to be affected. 2 However, the problem is worldwide in distribution. In the mid-1980s, 6.4 million Americans per year suffered episodes ofbronchitis, 3 and in excess of600,000 Canadians have symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 4 It has been suggested that 25% of adults in their middle years in the United States are affected. 5 The precise relationship of infective exacerbations to the progress of the disease in individuals remains uncertain, but huge sums are expended each year on the antibiotic treatment of exacerbations, indicating a widespread belief in the efficacy of such treatment among the medical profession. However, recent studies of lower respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) 6 \u2022 7 suggest that, while the majority of patients respond satisfactorily to traditional antibiotics such as the broad spectrum penicillins, others may not. Factors which distinguish this group ofless responsive patients have only recently been investigated. This overview will examine the epidemiology of the disease, current chemotherapeutic modalities, and methods of assessing treatment response and will suggest avenues for more discriminatory evaluation of new agents. EPIDEMIOLOGY A classic study of 1,000 adult bronchitic patients from 1951 to 1953 in London indicated that, after onset mainly from the third decade onwards, the prevalence rose steadily in the fifth and sixth decades predominantly in smoking men from the lower social classes. 8 This pattern of disease remained unchanged in a survey of 471 patients in the United Kingdom 40 years later, 7 the medical history and clinical features of these patients confirming the classic definition of chronic bronchitis.9 United Kingdom government statistics indicate respiratory illnesses to account for 14% * of cash sickness benefits and that 56% of this total was related to chronic obstructive airways disease, in comparison with 9% for asthma. Although the onset phase of this illness takes many years in most patients, once significant respiratory obstruction has developed, the prognosis is poor. The 10-year mortality of a cohort of 60-year-old nonatopic smokers rose to 60% compared with 15% in nonsmoking asthmatic subjects. 10 Annual death rates from chronic bronchitis in various countries, taken from the World Health Organization Statistics Annuall986 are shown in Figure 1 . In the United Kingdom in the 1980s, deaths from this disease and its exacerbations among adult men ranked third after myocardial infarction and lung cancer (WHO Statistics Annual, 1983), predominating in the lower social classes. In the 1970s, male death rates ranged from 33/100,000 in social class 1 to 97, 115, and 191/ ldO,OOO, respectively, in classes 3, 4, and 5. 11 Epidemiologic surveys, for example in England and Wales, 12 have suggested that recurrent respiratory tract infections in childhood, consequent upon the poor social conditions of the 1920s, may have predisposed to the development of chronic bronchitis in later life and that such factors may have had a greater influence on the geographic distribution of the disease than cigarette smoking. However, numerous studies have shown a positive correlation between mortality rates from chronic bronchitis and smoking, perhaps the most convincinR describing this relationship among British doctors. 3 Industrial pollution is a further major precipitant, massive increases in mortality accompanying the London and Los Angeles \"smogs\" of the 1950s and 1960s. Reid and Fairbairn 14 had previously defined the relationship between fog and work absenteeism due to A variety of microorganisms have been shown to be associated with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (Table 1) . However, the preeminent pathogen is Haenwphilus influen;::,ae which has been recognized since the 1950s to cause more than 50% of all bacteriologically defined exacerbations. 16 \u2022 17 Initial attempts to confirm the invasive nature of this pathogen by detection of serologic responses after exacerbations originally provided conflicting data but later evidence indicates a positive association and demonstrates the previously negative results to have been methodologic in origin. 18 The frequency of isolation of H injl.uenzae increases as respiratory obstruction worsens, 19 and its role in the initiation and perpetuation of the \"vicious circle\" hWothesis of bronchial damage appears beyond doubt. 20 \u00b7 2 The role of Haemophilus parainjl.uenzae is less certain: Smith and colleagues 19 identified the organism frequently but found no correlation with symptoms or decreasing pulmonary function. Another study of 214 patients found this organism in almost 30% of sputum cultures. 22 The propmtions of major bacte1ial respiratory pathogens isolated from patients in recent clinical trials are indicated in Table 2 . Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae account for approximately a further third of isolates from AECB.

Death rates per 100,000 population: adults aged .55 to 6.5. 1983. chronic bronchitic patients, H influen;::,ae and pneumococci are isolated significantly more frequently during infective exacerbations. 23 Further evidence suggests that they may persist in low numbers in sputum after apparently effective therapy of AECB and that the same pheno~ic isolates are responsible for subsequent relapses 24 \u00b7-\u00b7 5 Viruses and mycoplasmas are probably responsible for a third of all exacerbations. 26 Chlamydiae, important precipitants of acute bronchitis, play a minor role, if any, in the causation of AECB. 27 The majmity of patients with AECB presenting to primary care physicians receive antibiotic therapy. In the United Kingdom , this accounts for a substantial proportion of the 17.2 million antibiotic presc1iptions issued per year (Intercontinental Medical Statistics, MDI Dec 1993, MAT). However, between 1:3 and 2.5% of such patients with lower respiratory tract infections treated on a domiciliary basis return within a matter of a few weeks because of persisting syrnptoms. 6 \u2022 7 \u00b7 28 It is thus necessary to question whether antibiotic therapy per se is effective in AECB, and if so, whether certain of the newer antibiotics, which have improved in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics, are likely to prove more effective than traditional agents such as the broad spectrum penicillins. It is perhaps even more important to assess the evidence for the efficacy of rapid, effective therapy of acute exacerbations in preventing the inexorable decline in respiratory function which characterises this disease. Anthonisen and colleagues 29 found that the acute reduction in FEV 1 associated with AECB improved more rapidly with antibiotic therapy than with placebo. However, a comprehensive literature review 18 found only one study which indicated recurrent infective exacerbations to have any 'longterm detrimental effect on pulmonary function in chronic bronchitics.",

Patients al-located antibiotic therapy received either amoxycillin (40% ), co-trimoxazole (40%), or doxycycline (20%). Although the results overall indicated a significant difference in favor of antibiotic treatment, optimal benefits were observed in patients who had exacerbations characterized by increases in dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence (often termed the 'Winnipeg criteria\"). Subsequently, an Italian group 31 h studying a similarly sized population, showed a highly significant difference in favor of co-amoxyclav (Augmentin) compared with placebo in patients with standardized disease severity.

Although precise relationships have not been clearly established, both sputum and bronchial mucosal concentrations of antibiotics are considered potentially predictive of the outcome of therapy in lower respiratory infections. 41 \u00b7 42 In general, beta-lactams attain only 5 to 25% of simultaneous serum concentrations in sputum and bronchial secretions, whereas erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines often achieve ratios of 50% or more, and quinolones produce concentrations in bronchial secretions which are 80 to 200% of those in serum. 41 -43 Azithromycin is highz concentrated in sputum and bronchial secretions. Levels ofbeta-lactams in bronchial mucosa are higher, perhaps 35 to 55% of those in serum, while concentrations of quinolones range up to 200% and those of azithromycin may be 50-to 100-fold greater. 42 The ratios of the concentrations obtained in respiratory tissues and fluids to those in serum are shown in Table 4. The ratios of the attainable sputum, bronchial secretion, and bronchial mucosal concentrations related to the MIC90 of H irifluenzae and the pneumococcus are depicted in Figures 2 and 3 . High ratios should predict greater clinical efficacy, and these relationships are referred to in the following paragraphs dealing with individual classes of antibiotic.",

Despite this, very few trials have succeeded in demonstrating the superiority of novel agents which offer significant improvements in antibacterial activity and respiratory tissue/fluid penetration, over standard antibiotics. Thus, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin should prove superior to agents such as amoxycillin and cefaclor, but very few studies based on assessments at the end of therapy have confirmed more than equivalence. 54 \u00b7 56 \u00b7 57 \u00b7 75 In some cases, this may relate to the assessment criteria used. Thus if, as in the studies on fluoroquinolones by Davies and his group, 78 clinical response and pathogen eradication are insisted upon, the reappearance of a pathogen in follow-up studies a week after therapy may be interpreted as overall failure. However, it is increasingly recog-nized that H influenzae and pneumococci may persist in bronchial secretions despite apparently satisfactory clinical response, 24 \u00b7 25 calling into question this method of assessment.",

            "text": "Clinical comparisons made 2 to 4 weeks after completion of treatment, may prove more discriminatory. For example, Pines and colleagues 70 found no difference between amoxycillin and co-trimoxazole at the end of therapy but only a third receiving co-trimoxazole remained free of relapse at 2 to 4-week follow-up compared with 72% of those who had received amoxycillin. This difference was statistically significant. 70 Chodosh, 52 analyzing long-term follow-up data on a series of trials in AECB, has shown that the mean time from the end of therapy of one exacerbation to the onset of the next may allow more reliable assessment of comparative efficacy. Thus, if the time to relapse after ampicillin therapy (about 200 days) is taken as the index value, ratios for the same periods applicable to other agents can be calculated. Using this approach, the poor performance of oral cephalosporins is emphasized, the ratios for cephalexin and cefaclor being 0.31, indicating much earlier relapse after treatment with these compounds . In contrast, the efficacy of the quinolones is demonstrated by such methods. Ciprofloxacin (208 days to relapse) and temafloxacin (235 days) offer ratios equal to or in excess of unity when compared with ampicillin. 79 A similar approach was taken by Bennet and col-leagues53 who measured not only the time to the next exacerbation but also the number of exacerbations in the year following therapy. Alternatively, response can be assessed at a fixed interval. For example, Petrie and coworkers 58 found the relapse rate 3 months after azithromycin therapyofhospitalized patients conforming to Winnipeg type 1 exacerbation criteria 29 to be significantly lower ( 46 vs 62% ) than that for patients treated with amoxycillin. Clearly, the advantages of quinolones, new macrolides, and azalides are augmented by the relative lack of resistance among respiratory pathogens: for example, a recent study noted that only 105 of 162 isolates from AECB were ampicillin-sensitive. 76 However, although most studies comply with accepted definitions of chronic bronchitis and its exacerbations, interpretation of the results of clinical trials is complicated by a lack of standardization of the severity of illness in the populations studied. Empirically based systems such as the Winnipeg criteria 29 and the Italian composite score 31 b may define acute exacerbations, but no studies were undertaken to correlate their observations with outcome and thus with severity. We have performed an observational study of 471 patients with acute exacerbations, recording historic and clinical parameters at presentation and follow-up, and relating these to outcome, utilizing stepwise logistic regression techniques. 7 The results show that, while they may accurately define an exacerbation, none of the Winnipeg criteria (increase in dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence) either singly or in combination predict outcome. The two factors found positively to predict return to the family practitioner with similar symptoms within 4 weeks of the initial presentation were (1) frequent exacerbations (>4) within the previous year, and (2) significant comorbidity (unrelated cardiopulmonary disease). The latter factor conforms to similar observations relating to outcome of bacterial pneumonia. 81 \u2022 82 Trials comparing new quinolones, macrolides, azalides, and other antibiotic classes with traditional compounds should, in the future , be performed in patients who conform to these and the Winnipeg criteria and should involve assessments both at the end of therapy and through extended follow-up. Real differences might then appear in favor of the new agents which could be translated into improved patient care.",
