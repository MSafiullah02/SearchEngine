            "text": "For more than half a century, positive-pressure mechanical ventilation has been regarded as an essential intervention assisting patients with respiratory failure in the intensive care unit and facilitating oxygenation in the operating room. On the other hand, evidence from patient\u2019s studies indicates that mechanical ventilation is one of the primary factors leading to hospital-acquired lung injury, and patients with burn injury, trauma or pre-existing respiratory diseases are particularly at high risks [40]. A recent survey of patients having cardiac surgery revealed that though most patients do not have signs of pulmonary dysfunction or lung injury prior to the surgery, some eventually develop perioperative lung injury [18]. Though the exact mechanism responsible is uncertain, higher tidal volume employed commonly to reduce risks of hypoxemia and pulmonary atelectasis is thought to play a critical role [38].",

            "text": "Pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation had been implicated in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pulmonary dysfunction and lung injury [10, 15, 60, 68]. Overinflating alveoli and repeated stretching of lung tissues can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and diminish prostanoid synthesis that promotes redox imbalance and cyclooxygenase induction and inflammatory responses [68]. Also, formation of ROS disrupts the regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) causing nitrotyrosine accumulation, irregular tracheal mucus secretion, and increased airway resistance [63]. In addition, stretching lung tissues directly alters metabolism and secretion of pulmonary surfactant proteins (SPs) that mediate alveolar surface tension and lung compliance, while surfactant protein-A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) augment pulmonary immune defense mechanisms and inhibit endogenous lipid peroxidation [4]. Moreover, excessive lung stretch activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) that mediates the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that, in turn, promote adhesion molecule expression [28] and facilitate inflammatory cell infiltration in lung [34]. For over two decades, low tidal volume ventilation has been proposed as a protective strategy; still ventilator-associated lung injury is not uncommon and, thus far, there is still no consensus regarding the optimal ventilation strategy [48]. Terragni et al. [76] reported that even a well-accepted protective ventilation strategy, namely a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a plateau pressure \u2264 30 cm H2O, may not protect all patients against ventilator-induced pulmonary dysfunction. Consequently, an effective pharmacological intervention may be necessary to protect ventilator-associated pulmonary dysfunction and lung injury.",

            "text": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important antioxidant, active in endothelial cells, cytoplasm and mitochondrial intermembrane matrix [57]. It protects cells against superoxide damage through catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [50, 57] and thus inhibits peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative protein modification and cell membrane lipid peroxidation [27]. Moreover, SOD can facilitate vascular function, increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability through competing with NO for superoxide anions [31]. SOD was also shown to inhibit neutrophil-mediated inflammation through regulating neutrophil apoptosis [85]. Despite all the benefits and no major side effects, therapeutic efficacy of SOD treatment on tissue damage, in general, has been limited by its short circulatory half-life and low transcapillary permeability, due to its relatively large molecular size (molecular weight ~ 32 kDa) [84]. On the other hand, intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD has been demonstrated to be effective against hyperoxia-induced lung injury [53]. Though the authors did not provide explanation of why SOD treatment was so effective in hyperoxic lung injury, its protective effectiveness is likely related to its substantial permeability across the pulmonary capillary. Increased albumin concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is the hallmark of hyperoxic lung injury [53] and the molecular weight (\u223c69 kDa) of albumin is more than twice that of SOD. Albumin leak is also characteristic of ventilator-induced lung injury [80] and we suggest that the observed protective efficacy of intravenously administered SOD may imply substantial transcapillary permeability.",

Using an in vivo rat model of mechanical ventilation, we showed that 5 h of high tidal volume (HTV) ventilation can induce apparent combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorder and lung injury, evident by increased lung water content and albumin content in BALF. We have identified pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation and reduced expression of pulmonary surfactant protein (SP)-A and D as the main contributors to the impairment of lung function and observed that intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD effectively reversed mechanical ventilation-associated detrimental effects. In addition, intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD steadily increased the level of serum nitric oxide (NO) during the course of ventilation, suggesting that increased NO bioavailability in pulmonary circulation contributes to the preservation of lung function.",

After adjusting the respiratory rate of the system ventilator to match that of the animal, a series of forced maneuvers mimicking spirometric maneuvers in human subjects (i.e., inflating, occluding, and deflating the lungs at different rates) were conducted and parameters of lung function (i.e., lung volumes, airway flows and lung resistance and compliance) were calculated via the Biosystem XA system (Buxco) and exported to text files. Pulmonary function testing at each status (baseline or post-mechanical ventilation) was repeated three times to yield averaged measurements.",

Our data show that intravenous treatment of SOD attenuated HTV ventilation-induced pulmonary hydroxyl radical formation, lipid peroxidation, and significantly enhanced pulmonary antioxidant defense. Though the exact mechanism of SOD-related increasing GPx-1 is unclear, GPx-1 upregulation in response to increased Cu/Zn SOD has previously been observed in a murine cell line study [12]. Reducing oxidative stress and increasing antioxidant activity reduce RI and improve FEV. On the other hand, adding Cu/Zn SOD may not always reduce lipid peroxidation, and that is associated with the level of iron and catalase [54]. H2O2 derived by Cu/Zn SOD, can cross cellular membrane and form hydroxyl radicals or metal-related reactive species when interacted with redox-active transitional metal ions, such as iron or Cu, via Fenton reaction that leads to lipid peroxidation and cellular injury [17]. Since catalase reduce H2O2 into H2O, increased Cu/Zn SOD in combination with catalase decreases lipid peroxidation.",

Ko et al. [35] showed that excessive stretch of lung tissue induces non-infectious lung inflammation through activation of NF-\u03baB-interleukin(IL)-6 signaling pathways. Li et al. [39] reported that HTV ventilation caused significant lung injury in wild-type mice, but fails to induce lung injury in protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) deletion mice, in which NF-kB/MyD88 pathway was interrupted. Chiang et al. [5] showed that anti-NF-\u03baB antibody treatment ameliorates lung injury caused by HTV ventilation combined with lung ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury or by either insult alone, suggesting the pivotal role of NF-\u03baB pathway in lung injury induced by HTV ventilation and/or lung I/R. In autophagy-deficient mouse strains, where NF-\u03baB was inactivated, Lellouche, et al. [44] demonstrated that HTV ventilation did not induce lung inflammation or lung injury. On the other hand, Lin et al. [41] showed that Cu/Zn SOD attenuates the inflammatory response in human epithelial cells through inactivation of NF-\u03baB and activator protein-1, inhibition of JNK and p38 phosphorylation-mediated VCAM expression, and decreasing TNF-\u03b1 induced superoxide productions. Also, Yasui et al. [85] reported that exogenously added Cu/Zn SOD regulates neutrophil apoptosis and reduces the caspase-dependent inflammatory response [56], and that is mediated by NF-\u03baB [36].",

NO also involves fibroblast and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [21], angiogenesis, and neural development [14]. NO is synthesized in pulmonary endothelial cells from L-arginine by NO synthases (NOSs) existing in three isoforms, namely neuronal (nNOS or NOS-1), inducible (iNOS or NOS-2) and endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS-3), where eNOS is the primary NOS isoform expressed in the lung [30]. eNOS can be activated by agonists such as acetylcholine [14] and produces NO in a continuous and low-level fashion [73]. As part of the immune defense, iNOS generates NO in large quantities in response to stimuli, including TNF-\u03b1, oxidative stress, cytokines and various pro-inflammatory mediators [59]. Evidence indicates that decreasing NO bioavailability plays a major role in pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased airway resistance, resulting from hyperoxia [16], pulmonary hypertension [21] or ARDS [77].",

With the presence of ROS, vascular NO is consumed and NO bioavailability is reduced leading to vasoconstriction [51]. Moreover, NO reacts with ROS to form peroxynitrite, which in turn reacts with lipids, DNA and proteins, causing oxidative damages to cells, resulting in cell necrosis or apoptosis [51]. Previously, Jung et al. [31] showed that vascular NO bioavailability is strongly related to the level of extracellular SOD, since SOD scavenges superoxide anions that compete to bind available NO. In rats, Lynch et al. [46] showed that vascular Cu/Zn SOD deficiency, by means of restricting dietary consumption of copper, can impair endothelial vasodilator function through direct inactivation of NO. Besides, Wu et al. [82] showed that iNOS expression requires NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling in microvascular endothelial cells. We showed that intravenous Cu/Zn SOD suppresses iNOS expression in lung, potentially through reducing stimulation by ROS, and steadily increases serum NO concentration during the course of HVT ventilation, supporting increased pulmonary NO bioavailability. We also conducted protein expressions of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated eNOS without finding significant differences among groups.",

SP-A and SP-D, as pattern-recognition molecules of the collectin family of C-type lectins, mediate pulmonary immune defense through enhancing neutrophil uptake of bacteria [22], and removal of microbes and their debris, pathogens, allergens, dying epithelial cells and phagocytes [80]. Bridges et al. [4] showed that SP-A and SP-D can block low density lipoprotein oxidation and free-radical formation or propagation, so as to serve as potent endogenous inhibitors of lipid peroxidation and oxidative cell damage. Furthermore, Khubchandani and Synder [32] demonstrated that SP-A offsets the inhibitory effects on surfactant function by plasma albumin leaking due to lung injury. Yoshida et al. [89] showed that SP-D reduces alveolar macrophage-associated oxidant production, NF-\u03baB activation, and MMP expression. In mice, Yoshida et al. [89] reported that genetic deficiency of SP-D gene promotes alveolar macrophage infiltration, and increases MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 expressions and hydrogen peroxide formation in lung, causing progressive pulmonary emphysema. In premature newborn lambs, Sato et al. [67] represented that SP-D administration inhibited ventilation-induced lung inflammation. In this study, HTV ventilation was shown to reduce SP-A and SP-D expression in lung, while intravenous Cu/Zn SOD treatment increased both SP-A and SP-D expressions that were associated with improved lung compliance, decreased MMP-9 and NF-\u03baB expression in lung and improved lung function.",

Protective efficacy of intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD against HTV ventilation-associated impairment of lung function is related to 4 mechanisms: (1) reductions in pulmonary oxidative stress and improvement in cellular antioxidant defense, as seen by reduced MG and MDA and increased GPx-1 protein expression; (2) decreases lung inflammation, evident by reduced neutrophil and WBC count in the BALF and suppressed MMP-9, VCAM-1, TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS protein expression and inhibited NF-\u03baB mRNA expression in lung; (3) increased SP-A and SP-D protein expression that improve lung compliance and anti-inflammatory capacity, and (4) increased vascular NO bioavailability that reduces airway resistance and increases air flow rate.\n",
