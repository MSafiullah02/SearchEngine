The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food insecurity as inadequate access to affordable and nutritious food. In 2018, 11% of US households were considered food insecure, meaning they had difficulty at some time during the year obtaining enough food for all members of their household, due to lack of resources. 1 Pandemics adversely affect food supply chains and as COVID-19 impacts the lives of millions of Americans, the greatest burden will be felt by low-income families. 2 Although drastic measures are being taken to reduce the impact of COVID-19, food-insecure families with food allergies (FAs) and other food-related conditions remain vulnerable.",

Elimination of a common allergen, especially milk or wheat, can have a major impact on the nutritional needs of a child, 6 negatively affecting short-and long-term health outcomes. In addition, individuals with FA can place great strain on the labored health care system, with frequent emergency department visits due to severe FA reactions. Children with FA in the lowest income stratum spend 2.5 times more on emergency department and hospitalization costs, partially due to limited access to allergen-friendly foods. 7 Therefore, it is crucial to ensure these families have access to the necessary foods.",
