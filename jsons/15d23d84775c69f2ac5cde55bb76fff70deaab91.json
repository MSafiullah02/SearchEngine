Multiple serotypes are known to circulate within a location , while new variants frequently spread to different geographical regions. For example, the QX strain, which was initially identified in China, was first detected in Western Europe in late 2003, but was not identified in the UK until 2007 (Landman et al., 2005;  Summary Two tests were developed that allow the detection and genotyping of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and other closely related gammacoronaviruses. The first test employs a one-step, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in which the amplification is monitored in real time using a TaqMan \u00d2 probe. This real-time RT-PCR test was used to examine a panel of field samples and its performance compared to virus isolation in embryonated fowls' eggs. A total of 323 field samples were tested; 176 samples were positive using the real-time RT-PCR method, but only three were positive by virus isolation. Sequencing was used to confirm the positive real-time RT-PCR results for a subset of samples. The test is suitable for swabs and post-mortem samples and has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific. The second test, a genotyping method, was developed for identification of the strain of IBV present in field samples based on nucleotide variations within the gene encoding the S1 subunit of the surface spike (S) glycoprotein. This method was developed to provide a tool to inform vaccination decisions and for ongoing surveillance to detect new and emerging strains of IBV within the UK. The performance of the test was evaluated using laboratory isolates of IBV and field samples. Both tests are suitable for use in a high-throughput diagnostic laboratory. Gough et al., 2008; Worthington et al., 2008) . Different serotypes of the virus derive from variation in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) glycoprotein.

More recently, nucleic acid detection methods such as RT-PCR have been shown to be rapid, cost-effective and suitable for use in a high-throughput diagnostic environment.

However, because of its design, it will detect both field and vaccine strains of IBV. To allow determination of the strain of IBV present within a field sample, an S1 genotyping method was designed for routine use within a diagnostic laboratory setting. Samples of live attenuated IBV vaccines currently in use in the UK were sequenced using this method, and the sequence data generated used to populate the sequence library used during interpretation of the sequence data generated by the S1 genotyping test. Analysis of the sequences present in the sequence library demonstrated the sequences clustered in several main IBV serotypes including the so-called Massachusetts, Italy 02, 4/91 (also known as 793/B and CR88), Arkansas and QX-like serotypes (Fig. 1) . The variation within sequences in these different groups has been shown to be <5%, equivalent to seven base changes in the 140 bp region used for sequence analysis. In contrast, greater variation is seen between the different serotypes, with the amount of variation between serotypes exceeding 15% of the nucleotides within the region sequenced. Initially, to demonstrate that this method was performing well, it was used to test a panel of laboratory isolates representing IBV strains currently circulating in the UK . The panel included M41, Italy 02, D1466, D274 and 4/91 along with three QX-like isolates derived from poultry in Great Britain. Gel electrophoresis was used to demonstrate that the S1 RT-PCR was able to amplify the S1 gene of these IBV strains.

Unfortunately, it was not possible within the scope of this study to determine whether the diagnostic IBV real-time RT-PCR assay can detect pigeon coronaviruses. Although clinical samples from pigeons with suspected disease were tested, these were not positive using the diagnostic real-time RT-PCR. Comparison of the sequence of the pigeon coronavirus 3\u00a2 UTR to the sequence of the primers and probe used within this study shows several differences at the nucleotide level, suggesting that although amplification may occur, this could be inefficient and it may be preferable to use an alternative RT-PCR to detect pigeon coronavirus. The real-time RT-PCR assay targets the 3\u00a2 UTR of the IBV genome, adjacent to the poly A tail, which, unlike some other regions of the genome, is highly conserved in all gammacoronaviruses (Williams et al., 1993; Sapats et al., 1996; Dalton et al., 2001) . Because of the transcriptional strategy employed by coronaviruses in which sets of 3\u00a2 coterminal nested RNA molecules are produced, the 3\u00a2 UTR of the virus is present not only in the genomic RNA but also in the mRNA molecules produced by the virus. This means that there may be more copies of the viral 3\u00a2 UTR present within a field sample than other regions of the viral genome, making this region an ideal target for a diagnostic RT-PCR where a high level of sensitivity is required.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1102, "text": "(Williams et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1123, "text": "Sapats et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1144, "text": "Dalton et al., 2001)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "During this work, for each of the three samples that tested positive by virus isolation, a positive result was also seen using the diagnostic IBV real-time RT-PCR assay, and the presence of IBV within these samples was additionally confirmed by sequencing the amplicon generated by the diagnostic assay. Furthermore, a substantial number of field samples were positive using the molecular diagnostic assay, but no virus was isolated following attempted virus isolation in SPF embryonated fowls' eggs. Unlike virus isolation, real-time RT-PCR does not require the presence of viable virus particles. Therefore, the molecular method will be less affected than virus isolation by adverse storage and transport conditions that field submissions may be subjected to prior to receipt for testing which may result in degradation of the viral particles. This could account for the discrepancy between the results obtained with virus isolation and the realtime RT-PCR. The validity of the result obtained for 38 of the 173 real-time RT-PCR positive, virus isolation negative samples could be confirmed by sequencing of the amplicon generated by the diagnostic RT-PCR. How-ever, it was not possible to generate good-quality sequence data from all of the 116 amplicons tested, and we hypothesized that this may be attributed to degradation of the viral RNA after the long periods of storage and repeated cycles of freeze-thawing that the RNA extracts were subjected to.

S1 genotyping to identify an IBV strain is used widely (Kingham et al., 2000; Farsang et al., 2002; Bochkov et al., 2006; Worthington et al., 2008) and has been found to correlate with serotyping of the viral strain (Wang and Tsai, 1996; Keeler et al., 1998) , although it has been demonstrated (Bochkov et al., 2007 ) that genotyping IBV strains using either the S or N genes can offer a different perspective on the relationship of IBV strains. Genotyping of the hypervariable region (HVR) of the S1 gene has also been reported to yield the same result as genotyping the entire S1 gene sequence (Wang and Huang, 2000) . The S1 genotyping method described in this paper amplifies a region, including the HVR 2, which is known to show variation at the sequence level between different IBV strains (Cavanagh et al., 1988) . The use of a panel of both forward and reverse primers should allow the identification of the majority of IBV strains currently circulating in Europe, as well as offering the opportunity to detect novel IBV genotypes as they arise, which is crucial for informing vaccination strategies. It is also recognized that performing such a genotyping assay in a routine testing environment offers an extra challenge in the form of data interpretation, particularly when distinguishing field from vaccine strains. It seems likely, as discussed , that identification of strains with sequences identical to those of vaccine strains is likely to indicate the presence of the vaccine strain within the sampled birds.
