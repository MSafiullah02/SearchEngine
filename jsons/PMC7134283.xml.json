Makgato [6] attributed this poor performance in STEM-related subjects in rural areas to lack of learning materials, science laboratory and equipment to promote effective teaching and learning. Lack of parental involvement in their children\u2019s education also contributes to learners\u2019 poor performance in STEM-related subjects [5]. All the challenges that rural high school STEM learners face lead to demotivation when learning STEM-related subjects [4].

Furthermore, m-learning makes studying materials available to learners anytime anywhere [7]. One can conclude that even though there are challenges in rural high schools, learners can still benefit from m-learning as they have access to learning materials and to visualize experiments using their mobile devices [7, 9]. According to Kong [8], m-learning improves parents\u2019 involvement in their children\u2019s learning, which in turn improves learners\u2019 motivation and performance in STEM-related subjects.",

            "text": "However, despite the positive effects m-learning can bring to rural STEM learners and the ubiquity of mobile devices, its adoption into the classroom is far below the expected rate [10]. Davis [11] stated that the successful adoption of any information system contingent on the user\u2019s acceptance. As a consequence of Davis\u2019 [11] assessment, it could be argued that successful implementation of m-learning in high schools of developing countries requires investigation of all stakeholders\u2019 attitudes. A plethora of studies has been conducted to identify factors that affect the acceptance of mobile learning [12\u201315]. However, a key issue is whether academics have adopted an adequately broad approach when investigating the attitudes of the main players in a high school instructional setting [16]. Most of these m-learning acceptance studies have concentrated on teachers [14, 17] and learners [13, 17]. Little is known about the parents\u2019 attitude towards m-learning, especially in rural areas of developing countries. Teacher and learner preferences aside, parents have the last decision on whether to use m-learning. Parents\u2019 roles in m-learning include; financial support, encouragement, purchasing of the mobile device and data, monitoring that the devices are used in a meaningful way that enhances learning [8]. In spite of parents playing an important role in the adoption of m-learning, their attitude towards mobile learning has not been given the attention it deserves [19]. Ford [18] stressed the need to carry out studies on the acceptance of m-learning in the South African context and not to blindly follow examples in developed countries. On the basis of the argument thus far, the current research sought to examine the perceptions of parents of rural high school STEM learners towards m-learning.",

Studies have shown that parents have contradictory attitudes towards the integration of m-learning in children\u2019s education [16, 19, 39]. In a study carried out by Genc [39] on the perception of parents towards mobile learning, the results show that about 46.88% of parents were having negative perceptions, while 26.88% were neutral while 26.56% were having positive perceptions towards mobile learning. Genc\u2019s [39] results were congruent to Bourgonjon et al\u2019s [16] findings, who stated that some parents expressed negative perception towards the use of mobile digital games-based learning. In both studies [16, 39], parents who had positive perceptions towards the integrating technology cited the usefulness of it in their children\u2019s education. However, parents were concerned about the health and social issues associated with overexposure to technology [16]. A plethora of studies has shown that parents\u2019 PEOU has a positive effect on their ATT and PU [10, 16, 17, 19, 29, 39]. However, there is some inconsistency when it comes to the relationship between parents\u2019 PEOU and their BI to allow their children to use m-learning. Studies [10] and [16] found that PEOU does not necessarily have a direct effect on BI. On the contrary, Alshmrany et al. [17] reported that PEOU has a positive direct effect on BI. Tsuei [19] studied the effect of parents\u2019 PSI on their PU and PEOU. The results showed that parent-teacher communication positively influenced both PU and PEOU. However, the communication between children and their parents only influenced parents\u2019 PU but not PEOU [19]. These results show that social influence plays an important role in parents\u2019 acceptance of information and communication technology (ICT) learning. Tsuei [19] highlighted the need to build partnerships between schools and parents for the successful integration of ICT learning.",

Basing on the results of Lim [31] and Mboweni [34], one can learn that rural parents\u2019 perceived resources will affect their PU and PEOU towards the use of m-learning.

In this study, PSI is when parents of high school STEM learners consider the view of those who are important to them whether they should or should not allow their child to use m-learning. Parents of STEM learners in rural areas are influenced by messages about m-learning. This was suggested by Venkatesh et al.

If parents think that their community, children, and teachers are expecting them to accept the use of m-learning, they would have a positive attitude towards m-learning. Therefore, the hypothesis:",

Figure 2 shows the R2 of the model. The model explains 24% of PU 19% of PEOU, 43% ATT and 41% of the variance of rural parents\u2019 BI for their children to use m-learning. The variance explained in rural parents\u2019 ATT and BI is considered moderate, while, variance explained in PU and PEOU is considered small [36]. The results of Fig. 2 also shows the standardized path coefficients. The results show that all model\u2019s antecedents predict rural parents\u2019 behavioral intention to allow their children to use mobile learning for learning STEM. Results (Appendix 1) show the results of the bootstrapping procedure. The results show that all the hypotheses were supported except H3 and H5. Additionally, the results in (Appendix 1) show the effect size of these relations. Two relations (ATT -> BI and PEOU -> ATT) have large effect size, PR -> PEOU has a medium effect size while the last five (PEOU -> PU, PR -> PU, PSI -> ATT, PSI -> PU and PU -> ATT) have small effect size.

The results show that the model was appropriate for determining the rural parents\u2019 acceptance of m-learning as it explains 41% of the variance in BI. It was found that all the antecedents predict behavioral intention to use m-learning. However, only parents\u2019 ATT has a direct effect on BI. It would be reasonable to infer that when rural parents have positive feelings towards the use of m-learning, these positive feelings will reinforce their intention to allow their children to use m-learning to learn STEM-related subjects. Parents\u2019 ATT mediates the effect of their PU, PSI, PR and PEOU on their BI. The results show some notable differences from prior adoption studies [10, 11, 13]. In contrary to the previous finding, PU has an insignificant effect on rural parents\u2019 BI [13, 19]. The results show that rural high school STEM learners\u2019 parents are not acquainted with the usefulness of mobile devices in the classroom. However, the results also confirm the finding of [19], who found that PU indirectly influences users\u2019 BI by the mediation of ATT. This might mean that even though rural parents have limited knowledge about the benefits that m-learning bring into STEM learning, that little knowledge they possess positively affects their attitudes towards the use of m-learning for STEM learning.",

This shows that rural parents consider the effort needed to learn to use m-learning more important when adopting it than its utility. The finding might be due to parents belonging to the \u201cdigital immigrants\u201d generation which struggle to use mobile devices to carry out specific tasks. The results also show that parents are not indifferent to what other people (teachers, society and children) think about m-learning, as their ATT towards m-learning was influenced by their PSI better than their PU. These results are line with the findings of Tsuei [19], who found that teacher-parent and children-parents communication influenced parents\u2019 technology acceptance. PSI also positively affect PU and BI by the mediating of ATT. The results suggest that rural parents value what people important to them say about the use of m-learning for STEM learning. Therefore, it is important for teachers and learners to provide rural parents with an awareness of the potential of m-learning for STEM-related subjects.",

This finding was not surprising due to the rural environment in which the study was carried. Most of the families in rural areas are living in poverty and depend on social grants as their source of income [34]. It is also interesting to note that PR has indirect effects on ATT and PU by the mediating effect of PEOU. The results suggest that for rural parents, the availability of resources affects the usefulness and ease of use, which in turn affects parents\u2019 attitudes towards m-learning. The conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that, for a successful implementation of m-learning for STEM learning in rural areas, resources need to be provided. Based on the current findings, the following suggestions can be made to mobile developers and instructional designers and the Department of Basic Education (DBE), in line with Li et al. [13] and Nikou et al. [14] who studied learners\u2019 and teachers\u2019 acceptance of m-learning. Mobile developers should make m-learning platforms user-friendly and contain as much learning material and assessments as possible. This is because rural parents, teachers and learners consider utility and ease of use to be important when adopting m-learning. The DBE should provide resources needed for mobile learning. The researchers suggest that the DBE should supply rural STEM learners with tablets. Furthermore, the DBE should use offline portals to support m-learning in rural areas, make some partnerships with cellular network service providers to allow some educational platforms and websites to be accessed freely, this will remove the burden of buying data from rural parents.",

[22], who proposed that more variables that are context-related can be added to TAM to study the acceptance of an information system. In this study perceived social influence and perceived resources were added to TAM. The results showed that perceived social influence and perceived resources had a positive indirect influence effect on their behavioral intention to use mobile learning. The results also show that all the variables in the model predict behavioral intention to use m-learning. The predicting power of these variables is as follows: ATT, PEOU, PR, PSI and PU. The lessons that can be drawn from the study are that rural parents\u2019 attitudes towards m-learning and the perceived ease of use are the most important factors that they consider when accepting m-learning. This might mean that parents expect their children to be trained on how to use m-learning before its implementation.
