Influenza virus is of particular public health concern due to its association with severe infections and deaths [1,2]. Disease surveillance provides useful information that helps monitoring trends and disease burden, planning, implementing, and evaluating appropriate prevention and control interventions as well as allocating resources [3]. At present, the World Health Organization (WHO) runs the largest human influenza virus surveillance network [4], which includes 136 institutions from 106 countries mainly focusing on the genetic and antigenic characteristics of prevailing strains. While the original purpose of WHO\u2019s global influenza surveillance network was to recommend the content of the influenza vaccine for the subsequent influenza season [5], local and national prospective influenza and influenza-like illness surveillance systems also provide important information to policy makers and public health practitioners for situational awareness during periods of influenza activity.",

However, as different surveillance methods target only specific target groups of population possibly at different stages of disease progression, thus providing related but different information [8], using a single surveillance data stream to reflect overall disease activity may not be appropriate. It remains challenging to incorporate multiple surveillance data and fully utilize the available information from the data to summarize the overall situation.",

It is also important that the dissemination is not neglected. No matter how accurate and timely the upstream surveillance data collection and analysis of the surveillance system are, the return for the time and effort invested would be discounted if the means of health communication for data dissemination were suboptimal. Poor communications could lead to delayed information transfer, loss of information, or even misinterpretation of the surveillance results. Effort should also be taken for data dissemination to complete the surveillance-to-action loop [3]. ",

These tools emerged from the concepts of decision support systems in the 1970s, and, with the rapid growth in information technology through the 1990s, these have developed into standard tools in executives offices [11,12]. Their use has expanded to the field of medical science, for example, displaying bed occupancy, the availability of clinical staffs for hospital management [13,14], or monitoring the stock of different pharmaceutical items in the dispensary [15]. In a more general sense, digital dashboards simply describe systems for the visual presentation of key indicators in appropriate context, allowing rapid interpretation by an end user. A dynamic dashboard can be made interactive and user-friendly by allowing extraction of information in different perspectives and contexts. By investing in the design of data dissemination, the quality of presentation and communication of data by local health authorities as well as the general public could be much improved, thus maximizing the usefulness of available data of the surveillance systems.",

From this review and from experience of and feedback from the 2009 influenza pandemic, we identified the requirements for the new system. In response to these requirements, the design of the dashboard features incorporated merits of the national surveillance websites identified in the earlier the review, applied principles of efficient data presentation and dashboard design [16,17], and adopted recommendations from professional information technology consultants. Specific examples of each component were mainly extracted from the influenza surveillance dashboard, which was constructed as a demonstration of these design principles.",

Previously, much effort and many resources were required to improve the quality of surveillance data and the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Until the late 1990s, with the rapid development of information technology and the Internet, the timeliness of surveillance data transfer improved. Nevertheless, the methods and targets of data dissemination have been somewhat neglected, probably because communication and graphic design are apparently unrelated to the field of medical science. Indeed, timely and effective health communication is extremely valuable to transfer information to the relevant people who can take appropriate action. In particular, timeliness is always a critical factor for infectious disease containment and control. Comparatively speaking, fewer resources are needed to develop effective data dissemination methods than are required for data collection, quality control, diagnosis, and analysis. Researchers should also keep an eye on data dissemination to maximize the usefulness of the upstream surveillance effort.",

Furthermore, evidence is still lacking about the association between these new surveillance data streams and influenza activity. Whether these data provide more signal or noise is still in doubt due to their nonspecific nature. These data streams will still need to be evaluated and filtered to increase the signal-to-noise ratio before adding them as a routine surveillance practice; thus, they can only serve as supplementary information at the current stage. Other challenges for using combined surveillance data from different sources include the handling of missing data (eg, school absenteeism during school holidays), data provided in different resolutions (daily versus weekly resolutions), and unsynchronized data receiving protocols from different sources, which the algorithm should also be capable of handling.
