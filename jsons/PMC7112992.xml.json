All subjects had been in stable condition with no adjustments made to their respiratory parameters and no episodes of acute illness during the 3 months before the trial. Seven of the ventilators used were LP-10 or LP-6 (Aequitron Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN) machines, and 1 was an LTV-950 (Pulmonetic Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) device.

The current study did not confirm this finding, although this may be due to the very small size of the study population. It would therefore be prudent to monitor both oxygen saturation and the patient\u2019s subjective feeling of dyspnea after addition of a CBRN filter to any ventilator, and adjust the delivered tidal volume or peak pressure accordingly if needed.",

In our previous study\n19\n we postulated that in such circumstances addition of a CBRN filter to the ventilation circuit would not change the subjective effort experienced by a patient when pressure-triggering mechanical breaths. The current study confirms this hypothesis, with all patients reporting no subjective difficulty triggering breaths after addition of the CBRN filter as compared to before. It should be emphasized, however, that when using ventilators that sense pressure or flow triggering at a point proximal to the CBRN filter (such as most Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure [BiPAP] and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [CPAP] ventilators), patients may experience decreased ventilator sensitivity to their inspiratory effort after addition of a CBRN filter to the ventilation circuit.",

Ensure that patients and caregivers do not mistakenly attach the CBRN filter to the patient\u2019s tracheostomy, endotracheal tube, or facemask instead.(2)Tracheostomized patients should wear a standard-issue gas mask in addition, so as to protect the mucous membranes of their eyes, nose, and mouth. This is desirable, but probably unfeasible, also for patients with endotracheal tubes and non-invasive facemasks.(3)For patients using BiPAP or CPAP ventilators, or any other ventilator that senses flow internally and not at a point downstream from the added CBRN filter, consider making the following adjustments to the ventilation parameters:\n(a)If \u201ctime cycled pressure limited\u201d (pressure controlled) or \u201cflow cycled\u201d (pressure support) ventilation is being used, increase the PIP or inspiratory positive airway pressure by 2 cmH2O.(b)Check if the patient experiences difficulty triggering spontaneous breaths after addition of the CBRN filter. This may be mitigated by adjusting the trigger (sensitivity) setting, increasing the mandatory breath rate in compensation and/or increasing the PEEP setting.(c)If \u201cvolume cycled\u201d (volume controlled) ventilation is being used, consider increasing the tidal volume by 5% if the patient experiences discomfort.\n(4)If parameter adjustments are needed, consider whether this is best done by professional health care providers as opposed to the patient/home aide. Ensure that parameters are reset to their prior values after the CBRN filter is removed.(5)After addition of a CBRN filter to any ventilator, monitor both oxygen saturation and the patient\u2019s subjective feeling of dyspnea and adjust the delivered tidal volume or peak pressure accordingly only if needed.(6)Do not change the FiO2 because of addition of a CBRN filter.(7)Replace the CBRN filter after 8 hours of continuous use, or, if opened but not used, after 12 months of storage.\n",
