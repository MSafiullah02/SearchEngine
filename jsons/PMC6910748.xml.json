Moreover, biological hazard is a threatening disaster in Iran owing to the various cultural and religious mass gathering posing a high risk of occurrence, namely, the epidemic of influenza, hepatitis B and D, various types of haemorrhagic fevers and brucellosis. In response to these epidemics, Iran has used many strategies to cope with them. These include recruiting a surveillance system with mandatory reports of particular disease according to the guidelines of the ministry of health, training health personnel to prevent transmission of the disease in the community especially the high-risk group, using mass media to persuade community involvement in preventing transmission, controlling the vectors by using pesticides, educating people with high-risk job due to exposure to the disease source, preventing high-risk people in participating in Hajj (pilgrimage), mandatory vaccination if participating in certain religious occasions and educating hygiene habits like washing hands and using a mask in very crowded places. CBHOs participate in these actives to serve their covered population.44\u201348 This tool can help them to assess their preparedness in biohazard and recognise the need of enhancing their capacity.",
