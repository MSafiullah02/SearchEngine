Analysis of such data has revealed the oversimplification of existing theoretical frameworks to infer the final epidemic size or influential nodes from the network topology. Here we propose a spectral decomposition-based framework for the quantitative analysis of epidemic processes on realistic networks of human proximity derived from urban mobility data. Common wisdom suggests that modes with larger eigenvalues contribute more to the epidemic dynamics. However, we show that hidden dominant structures, namely modes with smaller eigenvalues but a greater contribution to the epidemic dynamics, exist in the proximity network. This framework provides a basic understanding of the relationship between urban human motion and epidemic dynamics, and will contribute to strategic mitigation policy decisions.",

In recent years, the mathematical modelling of the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases has mainly been performed using two approaches: agent-based models [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and structured metapopulation models [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Both techniques incorporate real or synthetic data on the long-range mobility and migration of populations, but vary in their granularity of the population, from individuals to sub-groups of society. Various spatial scales have been studied, ranging from specific geographic locales such as cities [4, 5] to nations [6-8, 23, 24] and intra-/inter-continental regions [15, 16] .",

When a susceptible agent is connected with an infected one, the former is infected with probability \u03b2\u2206t for a time interval \u2206t. If a susceptible agent is connected with d infected agents, they are infected with probability [29] . Further details of the stochastic simulation are given in the Methods section. In this study, \u03b2\u2206t is sufficiently small which enables us to perform the simulation with the discretised time step. An infected agent recovers with probability \u00b5\u2206t over this time interval. Once A(t), \u03b2, and \u00b5 are given, stochastic simulations can be conducted to determine the epidemic dynamics. We denote the probabilities that agent j is in state S, I, or R at time t as s j (t), i j (t), and r j (t), respectively; the equality s j (t) + i j (t) + r j (t) = 1 holds.

This approach assumes that, in a statistical sense, nodes grouped by the degrees behave in the same way. Under this assumption, one can derive the equation for the infection probability of each agent, and, in the absence of degree correlation, the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical value of the epidemic's spread, can be represented as a function of the first and second moments of the degree distribution [37] . One question that persists is whether such an approximation is valid in realistic networks of human contact. Actually, the accuracy of HMF depends on factors such as the mean degree and first-neighbour degree [47] . For the simplest case of the absence of degree correlation, where HMF is often applied, the component of the first eigenvector is proportional to the degree [44] . However, this assumption does not hold for the proximity network (Fig. 2a) . This highlights the need to develop an analytical framework to identify people with a high infection probability along with the overall infection propagation pattern. In this study, we have developed a method based on spectral decomposition and mode truncation which demonstrates that a small number of dominant modes, which may not necessarily have the largest eigenvalues, give a higher contribution in the prevalence of epidemics.",

In other words, few modes that have high contributions dominate the spread of the epidemic.ConclusionData on human mobility, particularly contact information of urban residents, play a key role in the analysis of an epidemic spreading. Such high-resolution data allow detailed individual-level modelling, rather than coarse-grained metapopulation studies. At the same time, novel theoretical tools can be used to uncover the dominant dynamics at work in datadriven models without the need for oversimplification. Linear analysis characterises the exponential growth in the initial stage; nonetheless, this study clarified that the final size of the epidemic is provided by the analysis of various modes. The mode truncation described here revealed that the prevalence of epidemics is actually dominated by a small number of modes as compared to the number of agents, i.e. the effective number of degrees of freedom is much smaller than the system size. The proposed method practically limits the expanse of mitigation policies such as targeted vaccination, and provides specific alerts by following the spreading trail of infection. This also quantifies the spatio-temporal risk associated with empirical travel patterns. The analytical framework and realistic mobility data presented here provide a promising starting point for the study and possible confrontation of epidemics in the real world. Future studies should examine ways to facilitate the rapid decay of dominant modes using dynamic intervention strategies.MethodsPeople flow data and construction of the proximity networkPeople flow data were generated based on person-trip surveys made by Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism.

Therefore, it is natural to ask whether it makes sense to consider a model with a small number of agents. A clue to answering this question is to use scaling. We found that this system exhibits apercolation-like transition: the order parameter of the giant cluster component size ratio S(N, d)/N has a second-order phase transition (Fig. 5 left). Although it is unclear whether the percolation-like transition takes place for large N (because of the spatial resolution of the data for privacy reasons), we found that S(N, d)/N obeys the scaling law (Fig. 5 right). Far from the percolation transition point, S(N, d)/N \u223c f (N 0.605 d) holds, where f is a scaling function. If we assume that this scaling holds for the size of the real population, the parameter values N = 10, 000, d = 1, 000 m used in the simulations in the main text correspond to d \u223c 10, 000 0.605 \u00d7 1, 000/27, 500, 000 0.605 \u2248 8.3 m in the real population.
