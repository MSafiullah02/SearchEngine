The other patients also had extravascular hemolysis manifestations such as increased bilirubin levels, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The potential explanation was that prosthetic valve dysfunction generates high speed and pressure gradient blood flow with high shear stress [15]. When this stress directly ruptured the erythrocytes, intravascular hemolysis occurs. When this stress only deformed the erythrocytes or compromised their membranes, it would be recognized and digested by macrophages in the liver and spleen, causing extravascular hemolysis. Both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis can be aggravated by cardiac-burden factors such as increased physical activity or tachycardia, which should be promptly treated or prevented.",

Several patients developed IMHA due to uncontrolled infection or autoimmune disease, which might be avoided if appropriate antibiotics or steroids had been given with the right doses at the right time. Major organ protection should focus on the heart, kidney, liver, and the hematological and coagulation systems, since major postoperative complications and circulatory supporting devices applications are related to these organ dysfunctions. Some late IMHA patients were critical and required postoperative cardiac and renal supporting devices. These patients had long ventilator hours and ICU and hospital stay.",

Both early and late group patients had a preoperative blood transfusion to improve severe anemia (Hb < 50 g/L). However, preoperative transfusion should not be too aggressive, because rather than transiently improving anemia, the transfused erythrocytes would be quickly sheared and ruptured by the malfunctioning valve, further aggravating hemolysis and related organ dysfunctions. Other blood products such as plasma and platelet should also be considered to correct coagulopathy, because many patients had hepatic and splenic dysfunction, and because of the use of anticoagulants, such as warfarin and heparin.",
