            "text": "Individuals who conduct disaster relief work overseas may be exposed to traumatic events that can cause distress and trigger psychological illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety disorders [1\u20136]. Disaster relief workers include professionals such as firefighters, police, search-and-rescue and relief teams, and medical personnel alongside volunteer relief workers with no formal training. Previous research has identified that the rates of PTSD amongst these populations range from 8 to 25% [7\u20139]. Whilst these figures underline the risk associated with relief work, they also indicate that only a minority of trauma-exposed workers develop psychological distress and illness [10]. This raises the question of whether it is possible to predict which individuals will be susceptible to psychological distress or disorder following the trauma exposure that can occur in disaster relief work.",

Those identified as being vulnerable may be prevented from taking up a disaster worker role, be more closely monitored during their work or be restricted in the duties they can undertake. However, pre-deployment psychological screening has a chequered history. In World War II, the USA identified around 2 million men as being at risk of breaking down under the stress of combat, the majority of whom subsequently proved to be resilient, effective soldiers [11]. Recent efforts to screen military personnel have demonstrated a similar lack of precision [12]; a study [13] screened military personnel for mental disorders pre-deployment, a frequently reported risk-factor [14], only to find that it had low positive predictive value for developing mental health disorders post-deployment.",

A recent review on screening within the emergency services [15] identified multiple predictors of mental health including neuroticism, pre-existing psychopathology, trauma history, maladaptive coping styles including catastrophic thinking and rumination, and social factors, such as substance related disorders. Still, the study came to conclude that there were no reliable ways to enhance personnel selection through screening and the authors deduced that further research on this topic was needed. The review [15], however, was limited to individuals working in general emergency service roles rather than disaster responders with most of the identified studies only including trainee police officers and firefighters.",

EO also undertook thorough reference checking and tracking, including forward citation tracking, of each included study and of relevant systematic reviews. In turn, this strengthened the search and greatly reduced the risk of missing relevant papers. All resulting citations were downloaded to EndNote\u00a9 software version X7 [17].",

Distress, at least in the short-term, is a normal response to a traumatic exposure and does not necessarily indicate the presence of any mental health disorder. On this basis, pre-employment screening for risk factors for distress may be uncalled for. On the other hand, distressed employees may require additional support from their colleagues and line manager, making identification of risk factors a worthwhile exercise. In this review, we elected to include studies relating to both distress and disorder. Although we include both types of outcome in our synthesis, our impression is that excluding distress would not have dramatically altered our conclusions.
