Zhang et al. noted that \". . . in an acute infectious disease epidemic, the radiology department plays an essential role in the diagnosis of infected patients. However, management of these potentially infected patients requires protection of both the medical staff and uninfected patients.\" We would like to share ideas on this issue.",

However, we still do not have specific protocols for radiological diagnostic units to deal with the many patients suspected of infection with COVID-19. Sometimes, the hospital administration may lack sufficient knowledge or neglect to provide appropriate support for medical workers caring for these patients. In addition, the problem of nonsystematic patient categorization and specific areas to triage, diagnose, and treat patients in the hospital may not exist. Since hospitals in our country are usually poor and often have limited resources, the implementation of good policies to manage these patients is an enormous challenge.",
