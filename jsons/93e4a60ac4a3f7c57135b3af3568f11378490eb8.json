However, outliers in the human-to-human transmission could be as a result of clusters that are yet to be explored. By advancing arguments for clusters of the novel coronavirus in Africa, we provided a social dimension to abating the spread of coronavirus diseases. Africa is predominantly famous for overcrowding their megacities like Pretoria, Lagos, Johannesburg, Cairo and Nairobi. Clustering by people either in public gatherings or residential facilities makes them endangered species. Even if social distancing is enforced in the public domain to prevent human-to-human transmission, it may be difficult if not impossible to enforce in an already overcrowded shared resident. By advancing arguments for inevitable human clustering at various residential or sub-groups in Africa, the study provides an econometric analysis of the social dimensions of the spread of coronavirus diseases in Africa. Apparently, this study leads the debate on spatial density and statistical credence of how confirmed cases is statistically related to attributable deaths from coronavirus diseases in Africa. We build upon the work of Sarkodie and Owusu (2020) to examine the phenomenological influence of outliers in the human-human transmission in Africa. The intricacies of these unobserved factors in abating human-to-human transmission of coronavirus disease in Africa underpin this study. We rely on publicly available data for Africa countries confirmed and death cases. We use a novel estimation method capable of accounting for crosssectional dependence. We found a basis for the strict orthogonal relationship among the variable and accounted for unobserved heterogeneity of the human-to-human transmission.",

We estimated the system GMM to account for cross-sectional dependence among heterogeneous observations. The one-period lag value of attributable COVID-19 deaths is positive and statistically significant at 1%, implying its percentage increase will result in 0.0123 percentage increase in COVID-19 attributable deaths. The intuition point to the relatively less COVID-19 attributable deaths as induced by previously confirmed cases. Although the lagged factors control for simultaneity bias, we cannot completely rule out the devastating influence of historical information leading to COVID-19 deaths. Types of shared residents, proximity to health care facilities, choice of healthcare utilisation in the time of illness and most importantly during this global pandemic, existing health conditions, as well as the devastating influence of COVID-19 attributable deaths to friends and family in terms of depression, frontline health workers who are saddled with the care and post-death management of patients, are magnanimous in this global pandemic era. In other climes, the number of confirmed cases is positive and statistically significant at 5%, implying 0.0453 percentage increase in COVID-19 attributable deaths in Africa. By way of intuition, a proportionate rise in confirmed cases is attributable to potential deaths by~0.045.

Dynamic panel data estimates are known to suffer from problems of unobserved heterogeneity, dynamic endogeneity and simultaneity bias (Baltagi et al., 2015) . System GMM, known explicitly for heteroscedasticity and non-normality assumptions unlike the least squares estimates, assumes linearity and uncorrelated error terms. Our first-order and second-order difference results in favour of the rejection of the null hypothesis in the firstorder serial correlation examination and acceptance of the null hypothesis for the second-order serial correlation test. Blundell and Bond (2000) argued that the system GMM estimators requires the presence of first-order serial correlation and not the second-order serial correlation in the residual term. The result of Table II confirms that we obtained appropriate diagnostics. z = \u2212 2.42; p b 0.05 at 5% level of significance in the first order serial coreelation analysis and then no second order serial correlation based on calculated z that is not statistically significant at 5% (z = \u2212 0.96;p N 0.05). The Hansen (1982) J-statistics test result confirmed the model has valid instruments since we fail to reject the null of overidentifying restriction at a 5% level of significance (p N 0.05;i. e p = 0.532). The F-statistics value 122.42 indicates the model is jointly significant at 5% level of significance.",

We presented spatial and statistical evidence based on the situation reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO). We advise the public on the cautious interpretations of our statistical model, which rely on phenomenological models as in most social sciences research and not a clinical procedure that has a confidence interval of 99%. We found Algeria to be the most hardly hit African nation (at the time of writing) by the rampaging virus (estimated in terms of the number of deaths recorded), and also we establish a linear relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the number of attributable deaths. Our findings corroborate the finding of Sarkodie and Owusu (2020) in one of their strings of findings. The study is limited to facts obtainable at the present time of this global pandemic.
