The stigmatized individual is \u2018reduced in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one\u2019 (Goffman 1963:3). The term stigma is used by those who experience it, and those who study it. \u2018Stigma researchers generally have two different ways of conceptualizing stigma as a psychosocial stressor, which are distinct from the types of stress induced by interpersonal discrimination\u2019 (Stuber et al. 2008:352). The stress induced by stigma has been described as the direction of negative societal attitudes towards the self, or the so-called internalization of stigma. The critique is that stigma researchers tend to describe the adverse effects of stigma on persons labelled with a stigmatized attribute, explaining stigma by examining the social cognitive elements of the stigmatizer, who perceives a stigmatizing feature, endorses the negative stereotypes about people with the perceived feature and discriminates against the targeted person.",

Enacted stigma refers to actual discrimination or unacceptability, whereas felt stigma refers to the fear of such discrimination (Scambler 1998). Causes, actions and consequences of these types of stigma differ. Tuberculosis (TB) patients who are HIV sufferers experience enacted stigma from the community throughout their life. In contrast, most HIV\u2013TB patients experience only felt stigma during a short period. For the HIV sufferers, the enacted stigma greatly affected the patient and the family, psychosocially as well as economically. This study found that the common expressions of stigma towards HIV sufferers include keeping a distance from the patient, refusing foods cooked or sold by the patient and prohibiting the patient from participating in social gatherings (for details, see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-287-119-0_4). The type and strength of stigma were closely linked with the type and strength of the categories \u2018defining oneself\u2019 and \u2018human bond\u2019 (Fig. 2.4).\n\nIn Canada, we want to highlight that the human rights of the HIV/AIDS-infected groups are extremely marginalized by laws and policies.

The concepts of stigma, prejudice and discrimination increasingly are used by the same authors in the same texts (Levin and Van Laar 2006). The undesired \u2018differentness\u2019 of a stigmatized category such as race can lead others to both turn away from and actively discriminate against the stigmatized (Goffman 1963). Thus, discrimination becomes an important component of stigma (Link and Phelan 2001). Where social inequalities exist, it is a key feature of intergroup relationships and serves to reinforce the symbolic boundaries that separate social groups from one another (Jackman 1994).",

Goffman\u2019s stigmas, blemishes of individual character and abominations of the body appear to cover every imaginable form of stigma or prejudice. Similarly, several of the prejudice models are not tied to particular in- and out-groups, and social identity theory is based on research showing that arbitrarily identified characteristics can serve as the basis of discrimination (Tajfel 1970). Clark et al.\u2019s (1999) analysis of the stressful consequences of discrimination should apply to any characteristic that is the target of stigma or prejudice. However, in other cases, this substitution does not make sense. \u2018Prejudice reflects a general negative evaluation or orientation to a group or a member of a group, whereas stereotyping involves the association or attribution of specific characteristics to a group and its members. Both prejudice and stereotyping can produce discrimination, an unfair or unjustified group-based difference in behavior that systematically disadvantages members of another group\u2019 (Dovidio et al. 2008:478\u20139).",

Phelan, Link and Dovidio believe the reasons that particular characteristics are selected as targets of stigma and prejudice may represent an important variation that was revealed by the comparison of stigma and prejudice models. Goffman adds that there are many forms and degrees of stigma which were left unexplored and portrays stigma as a universal human experience (1963:127). He explains the incidence of stigmatization by stating that \u2018[W]e construct a stigma-theory, an ideology to explain his inferiority and account for the danger he represents, sometimes rationalizing an animosity based on other differences, such as those of social class\u2019 (1963:5).",

Living without status may also mean that no application has been made at all, either due to fear, misinformation or lack of assistance and resources. It may also mean that someone\u2019s arrangement for sponsorship or work permit relationship has broken down. Canada has refused to resolve the situation faced by people without status in Canada including long-term residents who have been living in Canada for years because of a moratorium on removals. Entire families live in a state of constant stress and fear. Workers are exploited. Children of non-status immigrants, whether Canadian-born or not, are denied the right to education. Children and entire families lack adequate and affordable medical coverage. Some refugees have been forced to seek sanctuary in churches across Canada. In March 2004, Canada violated this sanctuary by arresting Mohamed Cherfi in a church (Canadian Council for Refugee\u2014CCR 2005). In 2004, the immigration minister, Judy Sgro, criticized churches offering sanctuary and incorrectly stated that refugee claimants have \u2018between 6 and 20 avenues of appeal\u2019 (Canadian Council For Refugee\u2014CCR 2005:2).",

CD4 counts and HIV viral load are the best indicators known so far for monitoring the degree of damage to the immune system from HIV and the risk of clinical progression to AIDS.

The viral load is a measure of the amount of HIV virus in blood, expressed either as a number ranging from 48 to 10,000,000 copies/ml or as the log of the viral load. The higher the number, the more quickly HIV will damage the immune system and the more likely one is to feel sick from the HIV infection. When the viral load rises to over 100,000 copies/ml (log 5.0), the medical provider may prescribe medications to combat HIV. These medications bring down the viral load, aiming for less than 48 copies/ml or \u2018undetectable\u2019 (Vajpayee and Mohan 2011:801).

However, one can start medication before the CD4 cells drop below 200 because the body responds better to medication when they are commenced at above 200 cells/ml. HIV medicines attack the HIV virus in the body, allowing the body to produce more CD4 cells. The amount of CD4 cells varies and may rise and fall. To determine if a change in CD4 cells is significant, the medical provider may refer to the \u2018CD4 percentage\u2019, that is, the percentage of lymphocytes with CD4 markers on the surface. For example, if the CD4 count was 400 (18 %) and then was 325 (19 %) at the next check, the HIV infection is not getting worse and hurting the immune system more because the CD4 percentage is stable or improving. When the CD4 percentage is less than 15 %, one is still vulnerable to opportunistic infections and should take medication to prevent sickness (Rodriguez et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2010).",

GT seeks to inductively distil issues of importance for specific groups of people and creates meaning about those issues through analysis of theory (Mills et al. 2006).

This technique is useful because of its ontological and epistemological significance and helps to ensure that the participants\u2019 subjective experiences are valued and their experiences can be understood by interacting with and listening to them (Fouch\u00e9 2005). The objective of the discussions with the participants was to understand their daily ordeals in carrying the burden of the disease and related tribulations of stigma and discrimination. Qualitative research designs are best suited to this task of understanding the complexities of lived \u2018experiences from the perspective of those who live it and in order to understand this world of meaning, one must interpret it\u2019 (Willig 2001:150). Interpretive researchers are interested in what is meaningful or relevant to the participants and how these participants experience daily life.

A few organizations that claimed to have been working with the PLWHA promised to lend assistance in conducting this research. After two years of consistent attachment and constant communication with those organizations, they were unable to present any of their clients to the authors. This is obviously a part of challenge inherent in such kind of research. Participants were recruited through a snowball and purposive sampling method. Some interviews were conducted online through various chat rooms used exclusively by PLWHA. In order to recruit a diverse group of participants, the recruitment process utilized a sample fraction for ensuring the inclusion of a proportional number of South Asian nationalities. Interviews were conducted at different times of the day to ensure accessibility and convenience for the participants. Participants were provided with information on the study, research goals and methodology, and efforts were made to develop trust and rapport with potential participants. Familiarity with South Asian culture and language and personal associations and knowledge made it easier for us to connect with participants and facilitate the interviews (for more information, see Appendix).",

These included issues related to family, social support, dating, relationships, sexuality and awareness about STIs and safer sex practices (Eysenbach and Till 2001). Gender issues are also important here, as this is highly relevant in terms of women\u2019s ability to negotiate safer sex and men\u2019s feelings of conforming to certain standards of masculinity in regard to sexuality. We used these thematic topics as a general guideline during the interviews to explore participants\u2019 lived and psychosocial experiences. However, no specific set of questions were developed for the interviews; rather, unstructured, open-ended questions were used to explore these issues. In doing so, it was possible to solicit not only the factual information required for the study but also allowed participants to attribute meanings and interpretations to events and relationships in their own terms and discuss issues that are most relevant and important to them (Mann and Stewart 2000). This method of unstructured in-depth interviewing was useful in generating insights about participants\u2019 experiences of themselves in their own worlds. It also provided an opportunity for us to hear participants\u2019 stories in their own terms (Anderson and Jack 1991).",

Unlike communities of openly gay men who are routinely targeted under HIV/AIDS prevention programmes and campaigning, MSM are often excluded or neglected in such interventions, and therefore high rates of transmission and infection remain among this group.

As research progressed, the difficulty of accessing the target population group was increasingly realized. It was not easy to collaborate with organizations working among HIV/AIDS patients. Incidentally, an enthusiastic, helpful and cooperative person who became infected around 8 years ago agreed to be interviewed. This person had already been interviewed by a number of researchers. This led us to a number of his friends who were willing to share their experiences.

The freedom is also there if they need to clarify anything (Marvasti 2004). During the process of narrative interaction, the researcher and participant give and take from each other, and this underlines the complexity of the area of interest being explored and, in turn, gains density as the conversation about meaning ensues. Therefore, the interview becomes the \u2018site for the construction of knowledge, and clearly the researcher and informant produce this knowledge together\u2019.

It is noticeable that in spite of wide cultural diversity, there is remarkable similarity in the way life is affected by stigma in different countries and health conditions.

Obviously, it is not easy to reliably measure such a complex psychosocial phenomenon. Brakel\u2019s (2005) review of more than 60 stigma-related papers found that the indicators developed so far apply only in a single particular field of health. Development of appropriate instruments of stigma assessment for a range of health areas would help develop stigma reduction strategies. Since this research is based on a mixed method technique, it is important to have instruments in place in order to undertake quantitative measures, as and where required.",

Shamoo and Resnik (2009) discuss some of these points. First, adherence to ethical standards helps promote the aims of the research, for instance, prohibitions against fabricating or misrepresenting research data ultimately promote higher standards of accuracy. Ethical standards also promote the values that are essential to collaborative work, such as trust, accountability, mutual respect and fairness. The guidelines for authorship, copyright and patenting policies, data sharing policies and confidentiality rules in peer review are designed to protect intellectual property interests while encouraging collaboration. Ethical norms help to ensure that researchers can be held accountable to the public. Funders feel comfortable to provide research funds when projects can ensure the quality and integrity of research. In sum, ethics processes promote moral and social values such as: social responsibility, human rights, animal welfare, compliance with the law, and health and safety (Social Research Association 2003; Shamoo and Resnik 2009).",

The last few years have witnessed major changes in the ethics of research, but a new consensus is evolving to involve the stakeholder groups most affected by a problem so they can participate more actively in the formulation of guidelines for research (Shamoo and Resnik 2009).

A field-test of the questionnaire was conducted before administering them to the respondents, and the data was crosschecked. \u2018The quality of a grounded theory study can be judged through the \u2018validity, reliability and credibility\u2019 of the data within the standard canons of scientific research\u2019 (Creswell 1998:209).

Validation was enhanced through the consultation process with participants to verify and expand the understanding of participants\u2019 experiences developed through the data analysis. Dependability was enhanced through the process of data analysis: that is, the data was coded and then, in collaboration with an expert, core categories were developed through mutual consensus (Lincoln and Guba 1985; Creswell 1998).",

Since this study deals with the South Asian community, sensitive issues needed to be managed with reference to a cultural perspective. Accessibility to the respondents has been a major challenge throughout the course of this research. Community organizations dealing with counselling of PLWHA were considered as important partners in undertaking this research. However, organizations have their specific objectives and interests, and sometimes they are accorded more importance instead of providing full cooperation with external researchers. Building collaborative research partnerships with these organizations was a major challenge and, on some occasions, posed a barrier to accessing research participants. Nevertheless, the cooperation of these agencies was invaluable for the study and contributed to more convincing findings. Finally, the question of representativeness and reliability remains a challenge in undertaking this type of research where the sample frame is unknown, and personal perspectives of both participants and researchers present a risk of influencing the outcome of research.",
