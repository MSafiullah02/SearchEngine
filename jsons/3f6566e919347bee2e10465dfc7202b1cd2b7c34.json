Phylogenetic analysis establishes the evolutionary history and relationship between genes by inferring the common history of the genes. To achieve this, homologous regions (e.g., the coding region of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene), are compared in a multiple sequence alignment. Infl uenza A viruses have a small segmented genome most of which is protein coding ( 4 ) . This makes multiple sequence alignment easy when compared to other more diverse and sparsely sampled viruses such as coronaviruses. However, infl uenza A viruses undergo frequent genetic mixing, termed reassortment, and caution must be used during analyses and interpretation of the whole genomes. Inappropriate analysis and/or dataset design can lead to inaccurate results and erroneous interpretations of the molecular epidemiology of infl uenza A viruses.",

A list of databases and programs and from where they can be obtained is provided below-where possible we have used freely available programs. Numerous data formats are used in phylogenetic analysis, but the most common are FASTA (or Pearson) and NEXUS. FASTA is a text-based format for representing nucleotide or amino acid sequences that is easy to manipulate and process using simple text programs. A sequence in FASTA format consists of a single-line description that starts with a \">\" (greater-than) followed by lines of sequence data. The description line most commonly contains the virus name. When a sequence is downloaded from public sequence databases as FASTA format, the description line most often includes additional information associated with the sequence (i.e., accession number, gene information, or collection information). The sequence data that follows the description line may be of multiple lines, for example: NEXUS format has been extensively used in sequence analysis and is accepted by many different software packages ( 12 ) . NEXUS format is composed of a number of separate blocks and standardized commands. These blocks can either be public or private blocks. Public blocks are utilized by multiple programs and house information about taxa (which in this case are viruses), morphological and molecular characters, genetic distances, genetic codes, assumptions, datasets, or phylogenetic trees. In contrast, private blocks contain information relevant to single programs such as PAUP*, GARLI, or MrBayes. The format is naturally extensible and fl exible, and can be created from scratch using a text editor or exported from other software that creates NEXUS formatted fi les (e.g., Se-Al: File>Export>File Format).",

Small variations exist in how different computer programs read the NEXUS format and these are most often associated with the treatment of special characters in taxa names. For example, \"/\" is unrecognized by PAUP* unless defi ned in the DATA block. In order to resolve these commonly encountered issues taxa names are often read enclosed in single quotation marks (i.e., 'A/mallard/ Alberta/300/1977(H4N3)'). However, single quotes are not recognized by MrBayes.

The main areas of the alignment that are likely to need manual optimization are the start and end of the alignment where not all sequences in public databases are incomplete at the 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 terminals. Other areas that may be misaligned include the connecting peptide of the HA, and the NA stalk that may have a deletion. However, it is important that the entire alignment be visually inspected and any misalignments corrected.3. For nucleotide sequences of protein-coding genes there are three visualization modes: nucleotides: edit an alignment of single bases; codons: edit an alignment of codons in any reading frame; and translation: edit an alignment of inferred amino acids translated using various genetic codes (infl uenza A virus genes utilize the universal genetic code) (see Note 5).4. Alignments can be edited by selecting a block of sequences and sliding the block relative to the other sequences wherein gaps will open up behind the block. In addition, sequences and their labels can be edited in a separate window by double-clicking on the virus name.",
