Most patients with H5N1 infection give a history of recent exposure to dead or ill poultry. Current data indicate an incubation period of 7 days or less, with a mean of 2 to 5 days and ranging up to 17 days [2]. A distinct feature of avian influenza H5N1 is the predominance of cases in children and young adults. Patients have ranged in age from 3 months to 75 years, with the median age being 20 years. Half of all cases have occurred in people aged younger than 20 years, and 90% of cases have been in those younger than 40 years of age [3]. Most affected individuals present with respiratory symptoms, but patients with only gastrointestinal or central nervous system involvement have also been described. In most cases, respiratory symptoms may be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, sore throat, rhinorrhea, or uncommonly conjunctivitis or bleeding gums. In severe cases, complications include multiorgan failure with renal dysfunction and cardiac compromise, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and pancytopenia. The case fatality rate is as high as 60%, with deaths resulting from respiratory failure [2]. Patients with severe disease often have leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia on hospital admission [4\u20136]. Other laboratory abnormalities include transaminitis (AST > ALT), elevated lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and hypoalbuminemia [1, 4]. Radiographic findings of H5N1 avian influenza may be include diffuse, multifocal, or patchy infiltrates, interstitial infiltrates, and segmental or lobular consolidation [7]. Pleural effusions are usually not seen. Progression to respiratory failure is associated with diffuse bilateral ground-glass infiltrates [5]. Pathological changes observed at autopsy have included severe pulmonary injury with diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage, hyaline-membrane formation, lymphocytic infiltration into the interstitium, and the presence of reactive fibroblasts [8, 9].",

            "text": "For both the H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, the average incubation period is longer than that for seasonal influenza (2 days) [10]. The usual incubation period for H7N9 influenza has been estimated to be from 1 to 7 days (mean 5 days), but has been reported to be as long as 10 days [10]. Unlike H5N1 infections, fewer cases of H7N9 infection have been detected in children, with less than 3% of H7N9 infections occurring in children less than 10 years of age [11]. To date, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, with most cases developing after exposure to infected poultry [12]. Presenting signs and symptoms may include fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, myalgias, and malaise [13, 14]. On laboratory examination, patients have been found to have lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia [15]. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and C-reactive protein have been reported [15, 16]. Complications including fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, multiorgan failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and encephalopathy have been described [15\u201317]. The case fatality rate for A(H7N9) (approximately 40%) [18] virus infections among humans is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections, but not as high as that of A(H5N1) (approximately 60%) [3, 12].",

Avian influenza H7N7 and H7N3 viruses seem to have a preference for conjunctival epithelium, and affected individuals may present with isolated conjunctivitis following direct contact with poultry or inoculation with contaminated material [19, 20]. So far, one case of death due to avian influenza H7N7 has been recorded; a Dutch veterinarian reported having conjunctivitis, which developed 1 day after he had visited an affected farm, and he died a week later from respiratory distress [21]. H9N2 influenza viruses have been reported to cause mild, self-limited upper respiratory illnesses in children [22]. There has only been one fatal H9N2 infection documented, in an adult with underlying conditions, among the approximately 45 cases reported to WHO between 1998 and August 2017 [11]. Most recently, on 14 February 2018, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of one case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N4) virus. This is the first human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) infection to be reported worldwide. The case patient was a 68-year-old woman from Jiangsu Province with pre-existing cardiac disease, who was admitted to hospital for treatment of severe pneumonia after experiencing symptoms for a week, and she eventually improved after 21 days. The index case patient reported exposure to live backyard poultry prior to illness onset [23\u2022\u2022].",

Zoonotic IAVs are suspected when influenza A viruses do not match any of the seasonal subtypes when their respective HA and/or NA gene PCRs are run.

However, these methods are time consuming and technically demanding, requiring banked virus isolates, antibodies, and virus culture to be conducted. The requirement of virus culture is especially challenging given the BSL3 containment requirement for suspected novel/zoonotic influenzas. Furthermore, molecular subtyping assays require periodic re-evaluation due to change in test performance (primarily sensitivity and specificity) as a result of natural genetic drift which alters HA antigenic targets. Because of these limitations, there has been an increased interest in molecular assays for typing and identifying zoonotic IAV infections in humans. Oftentimes, these molecular approaches rely on multiplexing, hybridization of specific probes, or direct sequencing of gene segments [36, 37, 38\u2022].

These differences in the benefit of oseltamivir might be related to the late treatment onset in early series, as a delay in treatment onset has been associated with poorer prognosis [52].

As observed for H1N1, the H275Y mutation in H5N1 strains confers resistance to oseltamivir but not to zanamivir [53], and limited data seem to show that zanamivir is effective in case of infection with a mutant H5N1 strain [53]. The H275Y mutation is of concern, as most seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) strains acquired this mutation despite the absence of antiviral pressure, highlighting a preserved viral fitness [54]. Fortunately, viral fitness seems to be partially altered in H275Y mutant H5N1 strains [55], making the widespread emergence of H275Y H5N1 mutants without antiviral pressure less likely.

The more recent CDC guidance on novel influenza A infections also recommends NAIs to be started immediately for confirmed and probable cases, as well as for persons under investigation, even more than 48 h after symptom onset, and regardless whether patient is admitted or not [62\u2022]. The currently recommended adult dose of oseltamivir is 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, [61, 62\u2022] but some experts recommend to consider treating for up to 10 days with 150 mg twice daily for severely ill patients [2, 60, 62\u2022], as human case series and animal studies have suggested that H5N1 might require higher NAI doses than other influenza strains [48, 63, 64], due to possible higher level viral replication or higher virulence. Given the lack of data about other NAIs in this context, both WHO and CDC emphasize the preference for oseltamivir compared to zanamivir [61, 62\u2022]. The CDC also recommends maintaining a high degree of suspicion for oseltamivir resistance and considers a transition to zanamivir in case of non-response to first-line treatment [62\u2022]. Because of widespread resistance to adamantanes, the CDC recommends against the use of adamantanes for H5N1 treatment [62\u2022], whereas the WHO recommends using adamantanes as a first-line therapy only when neuraminidase inhibitors are not available, and especially if the virus is known or likely to be susceptible [61].",

Even if human data are scarce, it has been shown that delaying antiviral onset is associated with an increased risk of death [75], which strongly suggests a benefit of early antiviral treatment. For this reason, NAIs are the recommended first-line treatments for H7N9 infection. To date, mutations conferring resistance to NAIs seem to be relatively rare, with a rate of less than 4% according to a recent WHO report [76]. Several mutations in the H7N9 NA gene can confer resistance to one or more NAIs [77\u201379]. The R292K mutation is of particular importance because it is the most frequent mutation in group 2 NAs (including N9 but also N2), and it confers high-level resistance to oseltamivir as well as reduced sensitivity to zanamivir and peramivir [80]. Moreover, infection with the R292K mutant has been associated with worse outcome in humans [77]. Fortunately, the R292K mutant showed reduced fitness in animal and human models [14, 78, 81]. Therefore, unlike the resistance to adamantanes, it is therefore less likely to see a widespread emergence of R292K mutants in the absence of antiviral pressure.",

Unfortunately, no universally effective avian or swine influenza vaccine exists, nor is there a single universal policy that would fit all situations or geographical regions [91, 92]. Ongoing surveillance and research efforts focused among countries with the highest ranking for spread and emergence of novel influenza viruses are prudent [91, 92]. Good animal health management, biosecurity, and hygiene practices are essential on farms [91]. However, efforts would also need to be implemented at other points of human-animal interface, such as live-animal markets, fairs, exhibits, and petting zoos. Therefore, eradication programs should also include increased biosecurity, extensive surveillance, and a comprehensive education program for the public [92]. Ongoing collaborations between organizations such as the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the WHO are required to share expertise in the animal health sector with the public health sector [91].",

Avian influenza viruses contain different subtypes of HA and NA glycoproteins and the genetic and antigenic diversity within each subtype resulting from various geographical lineages present innumerable potential targets for vaccine development; yet, not all strains may be of pandemic potential. In addition, the virulence of avian influenza viruses for chickens has limited the use of conventional methods for the production of vaccines from wild-type avian influenza viruses in embryonated eggs. In spite of these challenges, numerous vaccines against avian influenza viruses had been developed [2, 93]. In 2007, the US FDA approved the first H5N1 vaccine using the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 influenza strain. It was not made commercially available; however, it was reserved by the federal government for use in the event of a pandemic [90]. Subsequently, the US federal government has also maintained a stockpile of vaccines against Asian H7N9 viruses. Due to emergence of a highly pathogenic variant of H7N9 in early 2017, two additional H7N9 candidate virus vaccines were recommended for development in March, 2017 [11]. Candidate vaccine viruses continue to be made on an as-needed basis. These stockpiled vaccines could be used if similar viruses were to begin transmitting easily from person to person [94\u2022\u2022].",

In addition to personal protective equipment and careful attention to hand hygiene, they should be monitored for illness during and after responding to avian influenza outbreaks among poultry.

There was a lack of cross-protective immunity between the pandemic and seasonal influenza virus strains, rendering the 2009 seasonal influenza vaccine ineffective against the A(H1N1)pdm2009 virus [28]. The FDA and WHO identified A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) as the strain to be used for novel influenza A/H1N1 2009 monovalent vaccine. Manufacturers around the world developed pandemic vaccines, including inactivated whole-virion vaccines, split inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, and live-attenuated vaccines, including a novel type of highly attenuated influenza virus strain that is deletion of the NS1 genomic RNA segment [28]. It was shown inactivated vaccine containing 3.8 to 15 \u03bcg HA (of inactivated A(H1N1)) was able to induce potentially protective antibody levels within 2 weeks [28]. In spite of the rapid global response, it took several months to have the vaccines available. The H1N1pdm09 virus has since replaced the previously circulating human seasonal H1N1 IAV and is now the only H1N1 virus circulating in the human population. It has become the H1N1 component in the trivalent and subsequent quadrivalent human seasonal influenza vaccine since 2010 [91, 96].",

            "text": "As for influenza treatment, influenza chemoprevention relies mostly on NAIs. There is no data about the use of adamantanes for prophylaxis against H5N1. However, based on data extrapolated from seasonal influenza [59], adamantanes might have a clinical benefit in this setting. However, given the high rate of H5N1 resistance to adamantanes, the WHO recommends to use adamantanes for prophylaxis in high- and moderate-risk groups only when NAIs are not available and when the virus is known or likely to be susceptible [61]. The WHO does not recommend the use of adamantanes for prophylaxis in low-risk groups, regardless of viral susceptibility [61]. Interestingly, adamantanes are not mentioned in the CDC recommendations for prophylaxis [97\u2022\u2022]. However, given the fact that CDC recommends against the use of adamantanes for H5N1 treatment because of widespread resistance [62\u2022], one can infer that this antiviral class should not be used for prophylaxis either. Oseltamivir has been shown to be effective as a pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 in animal models [48, 63, 98], but human data are lacking. Data are even scarcer for zanamivir. Based on the evidence of efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis for seasonal influenza in humans [59], the WHO recommends oseltamivir (or alternatively zanamivir) as a first-line prophylaxis; recommendations were strong in high-risk exposure groups (such as household or close family contacts of a strongly suspected or confirmed H5N1 patient), weak in moderate-risk groups (such as individuals with unprotected, inadequate, or very close contact with sick or dead H5N1-infected animals and healthcare workers in close contact with strongly suspected or confirmed H5N1 patients regardless of adequate protective personal equipment), and oseltamivir was not recommended in lower risk groups [61]. The more recent CDC guidance recommends that close contacts of patients infected with H5N1 should receive oseltamivir or zanamivir if they belong to high-risk exposure groups, whereas prophylaxis should be considered for moderate-risk groups and is not recommended for low-risk groups [97\u2022\u2022]. In case of exposure to birds with avian influenza, the CDC recommends considering post-exposure prophylaxis in every exposed patient, based on exposure type and category risk [99]. In the historical WHO recommendations, prophylaxis dose was 75 mg once daily\u2014half the treatment dose as soon as exposure is identified and until 7\u201310 days after last exposure [61]. However, the more recent CDC recommendations currently suggest using the treatment dose of 75 mg twice daily for 5 days from the last exposure in case of time-limited exposure, and 10 days in case of ongoing exposure [97\u2022\u2022, 99].",

            "text": "In summary, illness caused by zoonotic influenza viruses can range from a minor illness with primarily respiratory manifestations to severe multiorgan dysfunction resulting in death. The case fatality rates can be as high as 60%, as observed in avian influenza A (H5N1) infections. While the two classes of drugs approved for influenza infections, the adamantanes and the NAIs, are available to potentially combat these threats, several of the novel viruses may be intrinsically resistant to these drugs, especially the adamantanes. For most zoonotic influenza viruses, neuraminidase inhibitors comprise the backbone of antiviral treatment, which is complemented by supportive care. Because influenza A viruses contain different subtypes of HA and NA glycoproteins, and further possess great genetic and antigenic diversity within each subtype, they present numerous challenges for vaccine development. Recent focus has shifted to development of universal influenza vaccines, with the aim to provide protection regardless of influenza A subtype by targeting the HA stalk which is common to multiple subtypes. The most effective way to prevent human infection with zoonotic influenza viruses is the avoidance of sources of exposure. Containing the spread of these viruses requires a multipronged approach to stem the spread within the zoonotic populations, decrease the transmission from animals to humans, and limit transmission between humans. Although today we are better prepared to face a new influenza pandemic and to limit the burden of zoonotic, pandemic, and seasonal influenza than ever before, continued effort is warranted to build on this knowledge such that we can efficiently combat the constant threat these viruses pose.",
