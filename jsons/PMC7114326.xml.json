Systematic surveillance at the national level requires a central authority which receives standardized reports of incident cases of disease or infection occurring among wildlife within geographically and politically defined surveillance units during specified time intervals which are generated by regional veterinary or public health officials. Ideally, reporting by local authorities would be legally mandated and standardized and suspected cases of disease would be confirmed by clinical samples tested at a diagnostic laboratory using validated methods. Epidemiologists at the central authority would collate and analyze the regional data to provide local authorities with a comprehensive national report on disease activity. Recent experiences with avian influenza virus A, subtype H5N1 (Ellis et al., 2004), SARS coronavirus (Lau et al., 2005), and the henipaviruses (Mackenzie, 2005) have focused attention on the possible benefits of collecting epidemiologic information on virus maintenance within wildlife populations serving as reservoir hosts.",

Furthermore, reporting of animal and human rabies is legally mandated by each state and territory within the United States (Childs et al., 2002; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005) and each case of animal rabies is confirmed by laboratory testing prior to being reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). As post-exposure measures dictated for humans and domestic animals are often based on the results from standardized laboratory testing for the presence of rabies viral antigen or RNA in brain tissue from a suspect rabid animal (Trimarchi and Smith, 2002), diagnostic testing is an essential activity and integral to rabies prevention (Gordon et al., 2005).",

With the increasing use of oral rabies vaccine (ORV) to control and contain wildlife rabies in the United States (Steelman et al., 2000, Kemere et al., 2002, Slate et al., 2005) national surveillance data have assumed a new importance in identifying the boundaries of areas affected by wildlife rabies.

However, cursory examination of surveillance reports from 19 states submitted from 1992 to 2001, using an index of \u226550% negative test results as an operational measure of adequate surveillance, revealed three states where insufficient laboratory test data precluded interpretation of the absence of rabies reporting; other states had a varied record of complete reporting. The operational criteria for adequate reporting used herein was liberal, chosen to capture states where limited resources may preclude testing of animals other than those directly involved in a potential rabies exposure to a human or domestic animal. When raccoon rabies is epidemic in a state the percentage of raccoons testing rabid can approach 60% in a given year (Beck et al., 1987, Fischman et al., 1992); the overall percentage of rabid animals will be diluted by negative results from other species and will fall below 50% (Gordon et al., 2004). As no guidelines exist as how to define adequate surveillance this arbitrary, but transparent, measure was selected as an initial reference value that in the future may be further reassessed and refined.",

The need to know the status of rabies within a specific locale is crucial when planning for rabies control as when geographically-targeted rabies intervention, such as ORV, is being considered to interrupt the spread of epidemic raccoon rabies into previously unaffected counties (Slate et al., 2005).",

However, a consistent positive association has been documented between the likelihood of detecting rabies in the reservoir host species and the total number of animal rabies tests performed (Wilson et al., 1997, Torrence et al., 1992). Regression analysis of the number of rabid raccoons detected per number of animal rabies tests performed in the 169 townships of Connecticut revealed a strong positive association (r\n2\n = 0.57; p\n < 0.01), nearly identical to the value obtained herein (r\n2\n = 0.54; p\n < 0.01). The robustness of this association across different geographic scales (169 townships versus eight counties) is consistent with results indicating that the percent of rabid animals identified becomes stable above a critical number of animal tests (Fig. 1c). This asymptotic relationship was well illustrated by the differences in median numbers of animals tested per county-year in laboratory counties (213 animals) and non-laboratory counties (25) where the percentage of rabid animals was identical (6.5% and 6.4%).",

Although urban parks can support some of the highest densities of raccoons recorded (Riley et al., 1998), indices of raccoon population size and distribution indicate this species is absent or rare in the most densely populated areas of cities (Anthony et al., 1990). The numbers of animals submitted for rabies testing suggests human or domestic animal contact with rabid animals is frequency dependent, based on the prevalence of rabies among animal populations and the absolute number of persons, rather than dependent on human population density.",
