            "text": "\nAlphaviruses are mosquito-borne plus-strand, enveloped RNA viruses that cause a variety of human diseases ranging from rash and arthritis by the \u201cOld World\u201d viruses to encephalitis by the \u201cNew World\u201d viruses. The encephalitic alphaviruses, like Venezuelan, western, and eastern equine encephalitis viruses, are endemic in the Americas, and recently introduced arthritic alphaviruses like chikungunya virus (CHIKV) can also cause atypical complications like encephalitis [1, 2]. Alphaviruses have an approximately 11.7 kilobase (kb) positive-sense RNA genome with a 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap and 3\u2032 poly-A tail that encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1\u20134) and six structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K/TF, and E1) that are expressed from a subgenomic RNA [3]. Recently, we have shown that the macrodomain of viral nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) of CHIKV enzymatically reverses the protein modification mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation in vitro. Macrodomains are a conserved protein fold found from archaea to higher eukaryotes and are characterized by their binding to the small molecule ADP-ribose and its derivatives [4]. The viral macrodomain is part of the nonstructural protein in a subset of positive-strand RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus [5, 6]. We identified and mutated residues in nsP3 critical for mono(ADP-ribosyl) binding and hydrolase (MAR hydrolase) activity, and using mutants with decreased MAR hydrolase activity, we demonstrated that reduction of this activity impairs viral replication in cultured mammalian and mosquito cells and virulence in neonatal mice [7].",

The approach involves the construction of an infectious cDNA clone by incorporating a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into a plasmid vector. With incorporation of the bacteriophage T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase promoters, the cDNA can be in vitro transcribed to produce full-length viral RNA transcripts. Transfection of the transcribed RNA into permissive cells results in production of infectious virus. To understand a loss or gain of gene function, variants or mutants are made in the infectious cDNA clone to produce mutant viruses in the same virus background for analysis.",

The 181/25 virus was derived from the Southeast Asian strain AF15561 by 18 plaque-to-plaque passages in MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts [18]. The infectious clone of 181/25 was prepared by employing site-directed mutagenesis to introduce five non-synonymous mutations into the parent clone 15,561 [10]. The parent clone 15,561 in a modified pSinRep5 plasmid was engineered to possess a SP6 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5\u2032 terminus and a poly(A) tail, followed by a NotI restriction site at the 3\u2019terminus [15] (Fig. 1). Because 181/25 is a vaccine strain, we reversed the attenuating mutations I12T and R82G [15] in the E2 glycoprotein to generate a recombinant CHIKV strain (181/25E2 I12T/R82G) that is virulent for newborn mice.\n",

Plaque assay allows the quantification of infectious virus particles which rely on the ability of viruses to cause cytopathic effects on the host cells because of infection. This section describes the steps involved: infection of cell monolayers with tenfold dilutions of viral supernatant, followed by overlaying with media having high molecular weight substrate like Bacto agar, agarose, or carboxymethylcellulose, which will limit the viral spread. The plaques thus formed are visualized by staining cell monolayers with crystal violet or neutral red.Day 1: Plate Vero cells in DMEM 10% FBS in a 6-well plate. A 100% confluent flask of Vero cells can be plated into five 6-well plates. Each plate will be for one sample; each well within this plate is for a tenfold dilution of that sample (Fig. 4). Incubate the plates overnight at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 (see\nNote\n13).Day 2: InfectionPreparation of overlay agar mixture \u2013 Melt 1.2% Bacto agar in the microwave and place in 42 \u00b0C water bath. Warm 2\u00d7 MEM 1% FBS in 42 \u00b0C water bath. Mix equal amounts of 1.2% Bacto agar and 2\u00d7 MEM and place in 42 \u00b0C water bath until use (see\nNote\n14).Sample preparation \u2013 Prepare tenfold serial dilutions of samples in 48-well plates.Add 450 \u03bcL of DMEM 1% FBS in each well of 48-well plate. Add 50 \u03bcL of viral stocks to be titrated to the wells in first row, mix well and transfer 50 \u03bcL from first row to second row, and thus continue serial dilutions as shown in Fig. 5.Infection of Vero cells \u2013 Aspirate the media from the wells and wash briefly with PBS. Add 200 \u03bcL of serially diluted samples to the appropriate wells. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h with gentle shaking every 15 min. After 1 h of incubation, aspirate the virus, wash with PBS, and add 1.5 mL overlay agar mixture to each well. Let agar solidify at room temperature, and incubate the plates at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, for 48 h.\nDay 4: Plaque staining and counting \u2013 Fix the cells by adding 1 mL of 10% formalin in PBS directly into the wells without removing the agar overlay. Incubate for 2 h to overnight (preferred). Aspirate the fixed overlay agar to an appropriate waste container, invert and tap the plate on a tissue paper pad to remove the agar overlay, and stain by adding 300 \u03bcL of 1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol in water. Keep for 10 min, and after cells are stained, wash in running tap water to remove excess stain solution, and air-dry the plates for an hour (Figs. 6 and 7).\n\n\n\n\n",

All experiments with the biological samples after infection with CHIKV in the virulent background 181/25E2 I12TR82G must be handled in the BSL3 facility.The mice should be bred under barrier conditions with a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.Timed pregnant CD-1 female mice are maintained in an ABSL3 facility, and the CHIKV infection experiments are conducted in 2-day old neonates.The route of administration is intracranial in a 10 \u03bcL volume having 1000 PFU of virus diluted in PBS. Prepare the virus dilution for one experiment (if it involves more animals for same virus) in one tube to ensure homogeneity, and keep on ice until use to prevent thermal inactivation. The same mutant virus is administered to all pups of a litter.Anesthetize each pup prior to infection using isoflurane (see\nNote\n16).Restrain the pup manually on a solid surface by firmly placing your thumb and index finger on either side of the head just at the nape, and insert the needle having 10 \u03bcL of virus into the right side of the cranium approximately halfway between the eye and the ear just off-center from the midline (see\nNote\n17).Monitor the mice twice daily for weight gain/loss and morbidity/mortality. If any animal shows signs of being moribund or reaches experimental end points, euthanize immediately according to a method which has been approved by the ethics governing body. The 2-day old CD-1 mice infected with virulent strains of CHIKV will die without showing much evidence of illness, so clinical scoring is not possible for this model (see\nNote\n18).At the end of the morbidity/mortality experiment, the surviving pups and the mother are generally sedated with isoflurane and euthanized according to a method which has been approved by the ethics governing body.For time course infection experiments to assess virus replication, at least three pups per group are euthanized at each time after infection, and blood and organs are collected. The pups are anesthetized using isoflurane, and blood is collected with a 1 mL syringe by cardiac puncture. The blood can be transferred to a microtainer tube and spun at 1500 rpm (200 rcf) for 15 min to collect serum.Expose the heart, and perfuse with 20 mL ice cold PBS to remove the blood from the tissues before collecting the organs. When collecting the brain, one half brain can be homogenized in 1 mL QIAzol lysis reagent for RNA isolation using RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit. Genetic characterization of virus replicating in the brain is carried out by sequencing (see Subheading 3.5). The other half of the brain can be homogenized in PBS (see\nNote\n19) and used for assessing the infectious virus titer using plaque assay (see Subheading 3.7).

The primers should be between 25 and 45 bases in length, with a melting temperature (Tm) of \u226578 \u00b0C. The desired mutation should be in the middle of the primer with ~10\u201315 bases of correct sequence on both sides. Adapted from quick change site-directed manual [https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/200523.pdf].Glycerol stock for the positive clones can be prepared and stored. But it is advisable to retransform the plasmid DNA and grow a bacterial culture from freshly grown culture to obtain a higher yield of plasmid DNA.For sequencing the macrodomain region of CHIKV , CHK nsp3 MDR primer 5\u2032- GGTACCCTCGAGTCATTAGGTCCGCATCTGTATGGCCTC -3\u2032 was used. For sequencing the larger plasmid, at least 100 ng/\u03bcL is required. The sequencing primer anneals to the positive strand of the virus.The restriction digestion enzyme for linearizing the plasmid is chosen depending on the restriction site engineered into the cDNA clone. For the 181/25 cDNA clone, Not I site is included at the 3\u2019terminus (see Fig. 1).For purification of the plasmid DNA, commercial PCR purification kits can be used. But for larger plasmids, the final yield will be much less for most of the kits, and therefore, the phenol-chloroform extraction followed by alcohol precipitation is advisable. However, the purity of the DNA must be ensured by finding A260/A230 ratio which should be greater than 1.8. Lower A260/A230 values indicate contamination from solvents (e.g., phenol).Purification with the lithium chloride precipitation solution provided in the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit will also yield the same quantity of RNA. Refer to mMESSAGE mMACHINE manual for further standardization [http://kirschner.med.harvard.edu/files/protocols/Ambion_mMessagemMachine.pdf].Warm all cell culture media, PBS, and trypsin-EDTA in a water bath to 37 \u00b0C prior to adding to the cells.The primers used for amplifying the nsP3 region of CHIKV in our study were:CHIKV nsP3 N1 forward primer(5\u2032 AAGGCCGAATTCGGGCACCGTCGTACCGGGTAAAACGCA 3\u2032)CHIKV nsP3 full reverse primer(5\u2032 GGTACCCTCGAGTCATTACCCACCTGCCCTGTCTAGTC 3\u2032)The PCR amplification with this primer set will yield an amplicon of 1.6 kb. The primers are designed to be highly specific and produce a single amplicon only. If other bands appear, further optimization can be carried out by gradient PCR or increasing the annealing temperature. Keep a nontemplate control for the PCR reaction.The plaque assay for CHIKV uses Vero cells. For Sindbis virus, we use BHK-21 cells instead. The methodologies mentioned in steps 1 and 2 are the same. The plaques in BHK-21 are more clearly visible, when staining the live cells using 1:10 dilution of 0.33% neutral red in DPBS. Add 1 mL of diluted neutral red on the top of the agar overlay and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h and count the plaques using a light box. For neutral red staining, the plaques should be counted immediately or/within a period of 2\u20133 h.The cells should be 90\u201395% confluent with few spaces at the time of infection. Usually 1 \u00d7 105 cells were seeded overnight to obtain a monolayer the next day. The incubation time for culturing should not go beyond 24 h.The 1.2% Bacto agar is autoclaved and stored at room temperature. The melted Bacto agar will solidify when cooled to room temperature. Therefore, take the overlay agar mixture from the 42 \u00b0C water bath just prior to use.The mouse models differ for each strain of virus. To study the virulence of wild type versus mutants for CHIKV , we used 2-day old CD-1 pups. The same kind of virulence study for the TE strain of Sindbis virus can be done in 2-week old CD-1 mice.Verify that the mice are adequately anesthetized by gently pinching the toes. If the animal withdraws their paw, anesthetize for few more minutes till a deep plane of sleep has been attained.Place pups on a thermal mat to avoid a drop-in body temperature during anesthesia, and monitor until they recover.Keep separate litters for morbidity/mortality studies and for a time course infection experiment involving the collection of organs and serum.We use lysing matrix tubes with lysing matrix A (orange-capped tube having garnet matrix and \u00bc ceramic sphere) for homogenizing the tissues for protein and tubes with lysing matrix D (green-capped tubes having 1.4 mm ceramic spheres) for homogenizing the tissues for RNA in QIAzol reagent using a MP FastPrep-24 homogenizer.Make sure to take out the BD OptEIA TMB substrate kit to room temperature, at least 30 min prior to use. Combine equal amounts of reagent A and reagent B no more than 15 min prior to adding to the plates.\n",
