The zinc atom of TDT is coordinated to the side chain nitrogen atom of H41 and the sulfur atom of C145 with a distorted tetrahedral geometry despite a rigid S\u2013Zn\u2013S bond angle of 93.3\u00b0 (Fig. 2E). The toluene group of TDT has no interaction with the protein. The inhibition mode of EPDTC is the same as that of TDT regarding the zinc atom coordination to two sulfur atoms and two side chains of H41 and C145 (Fig. 2B). Nonetheless, the local metal center geometry of EPDTC, unlike that of TDT, is that the zinc ion binds to H41 and C145 in a more typical zinc tetrahedral geometry with the S\u2013Zn\u2013S bond angle of 107.2\u00b0 (Fig. 2F). Moreover, the electron density map of the zinc atom and two sulfur atoms of EPDTC can be clearly seen in each subunit, yet the bulky substituent groups are absent (Fig. S1). The lack of electron density might suggest that the substituents are disordered. We have performed a computer modeling study to address the question whether the bulky substituents impede the binding of the complex. Fig. S2 shows that the entire EPDTC could be accommodated in the active site pocket, with sufficient room for the bulky side groups to rotate about. Therefore conformational disorder of side chains remains a likely possibility.",

This type of inhibition is similar to the zinc\u2010mediated serine protease inhibitor keto\u2010BABIM\u2010Zn2+ for trypsin in that a zinc ion is coordinated to two chelating nitrogen atoms of bis(5\u2010amidino\u20102\u2010benzimidazolyl) methane (BABIM) and two catalytic residues (Ser\u2010His) of trypsin in a tetrahedral geometry [18]. However, this zinc\u2010centered inhibition mode has never been described before for cysteine protease. The safety of zinc\u2010containing compounds for human use is indicated by the fact that zinc acetate and zinc sulfate are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease and Behcet's disease, respectively [19, 20]. The possibility of zinc complexes incorporated into cells through the cell membrane is also demonstrated by the studies on type 2 diabetic treatment [21]. Here, our results show that the zinc\u2010centered coordination pattern would serve as a starting platform for inhibitor optimization and the development of potential drug for SARS therapies. Since 3C and 3CL proteases with the Cys\u2010His catalytic residues have been found in several human viruses such as the family of Coronaviridae, and Arteriviridae [22, 23], these proteases can be targets for the zinc derivatized inhibitors.",
