BMI 25-34 kg/m 2 was used as a reference in order to perform dichotomous comparisons with patients with severe obesity (BMI\u2265 35 kg/m 2 ).

One of the strengths of the current study is that our included patients represent underserved and economically disadvantaged minorities; thus, revealing the early outcomes of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population and usually underreported and underrepresented in clinical research. Additionally, two researchers independently and blindly collected data which reduces errors and bias. On the other hand, our study has several limitations. First, our sample was relatively small, but given the nature of the evolving pandemic, it was of paramount importance to make our early data and findings widely available as soon as possible, especially given the lack of data up to date in COVID-19 in minorities and underserved population. Second, this was a realworld study with a retrospective design utilizing the electronic medical records, which is suboptimal compared to a prospective study that could have more accurate follow-up assessment. Third, the rapidly changing management of COVID-19 might have affected our results but it highly unlikely that could have differentials affected associations between obesity and mortality. Fourth, we handled BMI as a categorical variable in the regression analysis. This can lead to suboptimal conclusions, but we think that specific cutoffs, following established clinical guidelines on obesity, may be of more interest and ease for the clinicians compared to interpretation of continuous variables in a regression model.",

In conclusion in this early cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in an underserved, minoritypredominant population in the Bronx, we found that severe obesity was associated with higher inhospital mortality even after adjusting for other pertinent potential confounding factors. Particular attention should be paid in protection of this population given the higher chance for negative outcomes once they are diagnosed with the disease. In addition, obese patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be treated with extra caution given the possible higher risk for adverse outcomes. While we recognize the limitations, we hope that our study will stimulate additional researchers to further study the effect of obesity in COVID-19 and outcomes of minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm our data and pilot clinical trials are needed to assess whether pharmacotherapy for obesity and its comorbidities may improve outcomes in the short or the long term. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
