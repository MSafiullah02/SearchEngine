However, the antiviral compounds of I. indigotica were unclear until Li (2003) determined that lariciresinol isolated from this plant was useful for the treatment of influenza A1 virus. More recently, Yang et al (2013) determined that a lariciresinol derivative, clemastanin B [7S,8R,8\u2019R-(\u2013)-lariciresinol-4,4\u2032-bis-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside], significantly inhibited human and avian influenza A and B viruses.",

However, lariciresinol accumulates at a low abundance in plants. For example, its content in I. indigotica is only 68 \u03bcg g\u20131 of dry weight (dw) (Li, 2003), which not only constrains the yield of lariciresinol for the pharmaceutical industry, but also affects the use of the I. indigotica herb itself.

            "text": "Plant metabolic pathways are complex and often feature multiple levels of regulation, making the consequences of metabolic engineering difficult to predict. The existence of multicopy gene families in the metabolic pathway suggests divergent functional roles for pathway components involved in the biosynthesis of metabolites. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, six squalene epoxidases (SQEs) were predicted based on a homology search (SQE1\u2013SQE6) (Benveniste, 2002; Rasbery et al., 2007; Pos\u00e9 et al., 2009); however, only the products of SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3 were able to functionally complement the Saccharomyces cerevisiae squalene epoxidase mutant erg1 (Rasbery et al., 2007). Recently, only SQE3, but not SQE2, was found to functionally complement SQE1 in the promotion of plant squalene epoxidase activity (Laranjeira et al., 2015). At the early stages of Arabidopsis seed development, embryo viability relies on farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or an FPP-derived isoprenoid/sterol precursor provided by farnesyl diphosphate synthase 1 (FPS1) gene products, but not those of FPS2 (Keim et al., 2012). In contrast, Arabidopsis HMG-CoA reductase 1 (HMGR1) and HMGR2 are both responsible for the biosynthesis of triterpenes (Ohyama et al., 2007). Arabidopsis acetoacetyl CoA thiolase 1 (AACT1) and AACT2 can both complement the lethal aact deletion allele (DERG10) in yeast despite displaying different spatial and temporal expression patterns (Jin et al., 2012). With respect to lariciresinol biosynthesis, although some enzymatic steps have been proposed to be particularly important for activating the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) (Humphreys and Chapple, 2002; Nakatsubo et al., 2008; Satake et al., 2013), the specific roles of gene family members in regulating this metabolic flux have rarely been investigated. PLR, a gene encoding pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase, represents one of the most important rate-limiting steps of the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway (Satake et al., 2013). Hemmati et al. (2010) reported that both LuPLR1 and LuPLR2 are expressed in flax seed tissues, whereas only LuPLR2 is expressed in stem and leaf tissues. Zhao et al. (2014) reported that pinoresinol reductase 1 (PrR1), but not PrR2, impacts lignin distribution during secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. These studies indicated that PLR family members in plants appeared to play divergent functional roles.",

All the sequences were used as queries to search the I. indigotica transcription profiling database through the basic local alignment search tool (TBLASTN or BLASTN) to determine candidate gene sequences with an e-value <1e-5. The Pfam database (http://pfam.janelia.org/) (Punta et al., 2012) was used to screen the above putative sequences and identify the conserved protein domains with default parameters. Blastx alignment (e-value <1e-5) between the resulting sequences and protein databases such as the NCBI non-redundant protein database, the Swiss-Prot protein database, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, and the Cluster of Orthologous Groups database was performed, and the best aligning results were used to determine the target genes and their functional annotations.

Protein, buffer, and substrate were pre-incubated for 5min at 30 \u00b0C. The enzyme reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH and terminated by addition of 300 \u03bcl of ethyl acetate after 30min. The assays were extracted with ethyl acetate (3\u00d7300 \u03bcl in total). The combined ethyl acetate phases were dried under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 1000 \u03bcl of methanol and subjected to LC-MS analysis (see \u2018Metabolite analysis\u2019 above). For determination of Vmax and Km values, 10 different concentrations of (\u00b1)-pinoresinol (between 10 \u03bcM and 500 \u03bcM) or (\u00b1)-lariciresinol (between 0.5 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM) as substrates and 1 \u03bcg of purified ht-IiPLR1 were used. Incubations were carried out at 30 \u00b0C for 5min (within the linear kinetic range). The assay mixtures without ht-IiPLR1 were used as controls. The consumption of substrates was calculated for kinetic analysis. Vmax and Km values were determined from Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots, and kcat was determined by dividing Vmax by the enzyme concentration.",

To assess the impact of the expression of these genes on lignan production, variation in gene expression and lignan accumulation was exploited by using MeJA-elicited I. indigotica hairy roots harvested at different time points (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24h after treatment). The RNA-Seq expression profile showed that almost all tested genes except IiDIR15 responded to MeJA treatment, indicating their important role in MeJA-mediated transcriptional reprogramming. These genes responded to MeJA with different patterns; some (e.g. IiDIR1 and Ii4CL12) were dramatically up-regulated, some (e.g. Ii4CL11 and IiCCoAOMT2) were down-regulated, and others (e.g. IiDIR6 and IiDIR7) showed \u2018up and down\u2019 changes but without clear trends (Fig. 2A). Since jasmonates orchestrate a diverse set of physiological and developmental processes in plants (Pauwels et al., 2008), it is suggested that the various response patterns might be caused by several different regulatory mechanisms. The lignan content determination by LC-MS showed, as expected, that the signalling molecule MeJA greatly triggered lignan production but with different patterns. Each lignan showed wide ranges of concentrations in these hairy roots, indicating that the MeJA-elicited I. indigotica hairy roots contain significant lignan variation. For example, lariciresinol accumulation first gradually decreased, with a minimum amount of 36.4 \u03bcg g\u20131 dw at 3h after treatment, and then gradually increased and peaked at 24h with an amount of 77.0 \u03bcg g\u20131 dw (Fig. 2B).",

However, technological advances in data mining and modelling are now taking away much of the guesswork by allowing the impact of modifications to be predicted more accurately (Farr\u00e9 et al., 2015). This knowledge-driven approach for engineering requires a well-characterized population as a source of genetic variation. The potency of jasmonates, such as MeJA, to elicit secondary metabolism in cell cultures has made them powerful tools to cause the genetic diversity and help to unravel the complex cellular process (Pauwels et al., 2008). Combined transcript and metabolite profiling approaches to determine the MeJA-mediated regulation of secondary metabolism resulted in the establishment of gene\u2013metabolite networks involved in the biosynthesis of the pharmaceutically valuable terpenoid indole alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus (Rischer et al., 2006), in the characterization of enzymatic steps in the isoflavone biosynthetic pathways in Medicago truncatula (Naoumkina et al., 2007), and in the rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathways in Salvia miltiorrhiza (Xiao et al., 2009), as well as in the isolation of novel regulators of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Hirai et al., 2007).",

These hairy roots obtained from different time points after MeJA treatment harbour genetic diversity, impacting on the chemical composition of lignans, as shown in Fig. 2. Correlation analysis of gene transcripts and metabolite contents resulted in multiple new hypotheses regarding regulatory relationships between the identified biosynthetic genes and lignans (Fig. 3; Table 1). Seven biosynthetic genes were identified to be significantly correlated with lariciresinol, a pharmaceutically valuable compound of I. indigotica. To validate this network analysis, one of the best-supported nodes, IiPLR1 (predicted to be positively correlated with lariciresinol), together with its family members (IiPLR2 and IiPLR3, predicted to be uncorrelated with lariciresinol) were investigated. RNAi suppression of IiPLR1 significantly inhibited lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica hairy roots compared with the WT, whereas IiPLR2 or IiPLR3 suppression did not influence lariciresinol accumulation significantly. These results demonstrated that IiPLR1, but not IiPLR2 or IiPLR3, plays an important role in lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica, consistent with the hypothesized regulatory roles.",

It is thus speculated that as a key intervention point regulating lignan production, IiPLR1 expression should be significantly induced when subjected to environment stresses. In agreement with this, it was observed that IiPLR1 was inducible by MeJA, ABA, and UV-B, although the extent of the induction varied dramatically. IiPLR1 was highly induced by ABA like LuPLR1 from Linum usitatissimum, which was reported to play a key role in ABA-mediated regulation of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside biosynthesis in flax (Renouard et al., 2012; Corbin et al., 2013). Compared with MeJA elicitor, ABA was shown to be more effective in up-regulating IiPLR1 (peaking at 12h with a 14-fold increase), suggesting that ABA elicitation was a better potential strategy to enhance the accumulation of desired lignans of I. indigotica via the transcriptional regulation of the IiPLR1 gene. IiPLR1 responded to UV-B very rapidly, but the highest IiPLR1 transcript appeared at 30min after UV-B was turned off. It is suggested that the plant defence and repair process in response to UV-B happened sequentially; thus IiPLR1 needed to be be highly expressed at different times, and the fact that the highest IiPLR1 transcript was found after UV-B was turned off was probably due to the repair rather than the protection mechanism (Di et al., 2012). However, this remains to be investigated.",

Although IiPLR1 has a high level of amino acid identity (85%) with AtPrR2, which shows strict substrate specificity toward pinoresinol but no activity toward lariciresinol (Nakatsubo et al., 2008), IiPLR1 reduces both pinoresinol and lariciresinol efficiently like FiPLR1 from Forsythia intermedia (Dinkova-Kostova et al., 1996), TpPLR1 and TpPLR2 from Thuja plicata (Fujita et al., 1999), as well as LpPLR1 from Linum perenne (Hemmati et al., 2007) (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the activity of IiPLR1 toward (\u00b1)-lariciresinol is comparable with that toward (\u00b1)-pinoresinol with regard to kcat/Km values (Table 2). The underlying molecular basis of the difference in substrate selectivity between IiPLR1 and AtPrR2 is worth investigating in the future.",

As expected, the lariciresinol content significantly increased following introduction of the IiPLR1 gene. Generally, a high content of secondary metabolites in the tissues is associated with poor growth, and the actual total productivity of secondary metabolites therefore remains low (Jouhikainen et al., 1999). It was found in this study, however, that the growth rate in the high lariciresinol-producing lines ovx-2 (353.9 \u03bcg g\u20131 dw, 6.3-fold that of the WT) and ovx-8 (310.4 \u03bcg g\u20131 dw, 5.5-fold that of the WT) was not reduced as compared with those with low lariciresinol production including WT and CK lines. The current study provides an effective approach for commercial large-scale production of lariciresinol by using the I. indigotica hairy root systems as bioreactors.",

In the case of PLR, which is undoubtedly a key rate-limiting step of the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway, three IiPLRs were predicted from I. indigotica based on homology search (IiPLR1\u2013IiPLR3); however, only IiPLR1 influenced lariciresinol biosynthesis. The comprehensive profiling approach described here provides a good example to locate the most potential member(s) rapidlly from a multicopy gene family. Moreover, the present approach of integrated transcriptome and metabolite profiling using MeJA-elicited I. indigotica hairy roots as a source of variation of gene expression and metabolites provided insight into multiple previously uncharacterized candidate lignan-correlated genes. One candidate, IiPLR1, was demonstrated to indeed be important in lariciresinol biosynthesis, indicating that the analysis is robust and genes identified via this process are worthy of validation.",
