            "text": "Infections by canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) have been reported worldwide from several free-ranging and captive carnivore species included in the Canidae, Ursidae and Mustelidae families (Woods, 2001). Whilst the infection is well described in dogs, causing a systemic disease known as infectious canine hepatitis (ICH), mainly characterised by acute necrohaemorragic hepatitis, uveitis and interstitial nephritis (Decaro et al., 2008; Green, 2006), clinical signs and pathogenetic features are poorly defined in wild canids. The first cases in wildlife were described in 1930 in silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from North America, and the disease was defined \u201cepizootic fox encephalitis\u201d based on the neurological signs encountered (Green et al., 1930). Later reports have suggested the role of CAdV-1 in inapparent infections in foxes (Balboni et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2016a), with sporadic fatal cases reported in wild carnivores, such as fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) (Choi et al., 2014), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (Walker et al., 2016b), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) (Gerhold et al., 2007), black bear (Ursus americanus) (Pursell et al., 1983), Eurasian river otter (Lutra lutra) (Park et al., 2007), and Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus) (Pizzurro et al., 2017). Most data currently available rely on serological studies, showing that circulation of CAdVs is relevant in several countries, with prevalences up to 97% in island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) (Garcelon et al., 1992) and 88% in grey foxes from California (Riley et al., 2004) and 94.7% in wolves (Canis lupus) from Alaska (Stephenson et al., 1982). In red foxes, CAdV seroprevalence was 19% to 64.4% in UK (Thompson et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2016a), 3.5% in Germany (Truyen et al., 1998), 59.6% in Scandinavia (Akerstedt et al., 2010) and 23.2% in Australia (Robinson et al., 2005). However, serological studies do not provide information about the disease, and, moreover, do not distinguish between CAdV-1 and the strictly related canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2), one of the causative agents of the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), a multifactorial disease of dogs (Decaro et al., 2008). Recently, circulation of CAdVs in domestic dogs has dramatically decreased, at least in developed countries, due to the extensive vaccination of dogs using cross-protective CAdV-2 modified-live virus. Nonetheless, re-emergence of adenovirus infections in dogs has been documented worldwide (Decaro et al., 2004; Benetka et al., 2006; M\u00fcller et al., 2010; Balboni et al., 2014; Pintore et al., 2016). Recent evidences suggest the role of foxes as reservoir of CAdV-1 (Balboni et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2016a). Red foxes are the most significant free-ranging wild species in Europe and represent a sympatric species with the domestic dogs, thus playing an important role in disease ecology, due to their high population density and intrusive behaviour (Bateman and Fleming, 2012; Gehrt et al., 2010). The threat of disease transmission from domestic animals to wildlife has generated a growing concern with respect to species conservation and disease ecology (Fiorello et al., 2006; Knobel et al., 2014). Though the scarce information available does not allow defining a clear picture on infection dynamics in the wildlife, a more complex interaction is feasible among all the carnivore species susceptible to CAdVs.",

She had presented with an intermittent head shaking for 2 days and weakness and anorexia for 1 day. The carcass, designated as Wolf/835/2015/FRA, was submitted to necropsy and investigated for infectious causes of disease. Necropsy showed haemorrhagic enteritis as the main gross lesion, along with petechia at the coronary heart, a firm and slightly discoloured liver, haemorrhagic mesenteric lymph nodes and superficial wounds. Sera and tissues from intestine, liver, spleen and kidney were collected and submitted to molecular investigation and histopathology. The wolf belonged to a pack of eight established in 2006 by three German individuals, herein referred as pack 2, where she occupied the lowest rank in the pack hierarchy, representing an omega member. A pack of Eurasian wolves had been living in the park since 1986, referred as pack 1, initially founded by three French wolves, and later increased to 12 individuals. The last three wolves of this pack were transferred to another zoological park at the beginning of May 2015. In 2013 an exchange of enclosure between the two packs occurred. Further on, in December 2015 three individuals from a French zoo had been newly introduced generating a new pack, namely pack 3.",

A total of 203,549 reads of 243.6 bps average length were mapped to the reference sequence CAdV-1 strain R1261 (GenBank accession number Y07760) with a mean coverage of 1620.6, generating a consensus sequence of 30,534 bps covering 100% of the reference genome. The assembly was performed using the Geneious software package (version 10.1.3). The full-length genome of CAdV-1 isolate Wolf/835/2015/FRA revealed a structure similar to previously described CAdVs. The genome is flanked on both sides by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of 158 bps in length, as in the Italian wolf isolate ITL2015 (Pizzurro et al., 2017). Both wolf viruses showed a deletion of 41 bps compared to CAdV-1 vaccine strain CLL, whose genome was 3-bps larger than that of CAdV-1 strain R1261 (Sira et al., 1987). The hexon gene revealed the same pattern of amino acid (aa) substitutions observed in previously characterised CAdV strains isolated in Italy from two dogs (strains 574-2013-RS and 417-2013-L) and a red fox (strain 113-5 L) (Balboni et al., 2017). Specifically, the aa mutation from asparagine to serine at position 388 was shared by those Italian isolates, the wolf isolate from this study (Wolf/835/2015/FRA) and the recent Italian wolf isolate (Pizzurro et al., 2017), defining a clear distinctive pattern of substitution. Similarly, in the fibre protein, aa substitutions were exactly as described for the Italian isolates, matching with the wolf isolate ITL2015, with the only exception at residue 110, where isolate Wolf/835/2015/FRA retained the same aa observed for other CAdV-1 strains. A unique feature to isolate Wolf/835/2015/FRA emerged at position 49 of the E1B 55 kDa protein, where a change from proline to serine occurred. Additional mutations occurred at positions 310 and 326 of the same protein, at position 73 of pIX and at position 293 of pIIIa, with all the changes being shared with CAdV-2 Toronto 26/61 (GenBank accession number CAU77082) and BatAdV PPV1 (JN252129). Strain Wolf/835/2015/FRA displayed a unique triplet inserted at position 475 of the pIIIa protein and another unique change at position 363 of the DNA binding protein encoded by gene E2 A. Common features with strain ITL2015 appeared at position 388 of pVa, and at the N-terminus of E4 ORF3 where an additional methionine was observed.",

The 5 raccoons, the single brown bear and the European pine marten tested all seronegative, while the presence of specific antibodies in the 2 timber wolves and 1 arctic wolf could be due to the CAdV-2 vaccination carried out 2.5 and 3 years before sample collection, respectively. Conversely, a large proportion (8/11 animals) of the arctic wolves tested seropositive, although animals #28 to 33 had been sampled in their park of origin, in Austria, thus accounting for silent CAdV circulation in another zoological park.",

            "text": "The present study reports the consecutive appearance of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 infections in wild carnivores of a French zoological park. CAdV-1 was isolated from a case of fatal infection in a Eurasian wolf maintained in a large natural enclosure in the Parc Animalier de Sainte-Croix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of CAdV-1 infection in a captive wolf. By whole genome sequencing and subsequent sequence analysis, the wolf CAdV-1 isolate was found to be genetically related to a strain recently retrieved from a free-ranging wolf in Italy (Pizzurro et al., 2017), displaying a nt identity of 99.8%. A high genetic relatedness (\u223c99% nt identity) was also evident to CAdV-1 strains recovered from other wild and domestic carnivores, confirming that the virus is genetically stable even across different host species. The limited availability of complete CAdV genomes prevented a more in-depth comprehension of the virus genetic relationship, thus leading to restrict the analysis to shorter genomic fragments in order to include strains detected in different carnivore species and geographic areas. Phylogenetic analysis performed on the E3 and hexon genes showed that isolate Wolf/835/2015/FRA segregated with recent Italian CAdV-1 strains detected in dogs, red foxes and wolves (Fig. 2). An in-depth analysis revealed that several aa mutations were scattered through all the proteome, which were mostly shared by Italian strains (Balboni et al., 2013; Pizzurro et al., 2017). Interestingly, both wolf strains, Wolf/835/2015/FRA and ITL2015 displayed shorter ITRs compared to extant CAdVs. The ITRs have an essential function in virus replication, taking part in the protein-primed DNA replication mechanism, thus constituting an important junction in virus evolution and recombination. Similarly, both wolf strains showed a duplication of the starting methionine of ORF3 in the E4 region and an aa mutation at position 388 of pVa, traditionally involved in duplication or deletion events in Mastadenovirus evolution (Davison et al., 2003). These common features may represent an evolutionary adaptation of CAdV-1 to the wolf species, but they need to be supported by sequence data from additional wolf isolates. Most of the genus-specific genes in adenoviruses are located near the ends of the genome, many of these captured from the host and involved in host interaction and adaptation to biological niches. Mutations in these genus- and virus-specific genes are therefore relevant for viral fitness and host adaptation in vivo. The genus-specific E1B 55 kDa protein of isolate Wolf/835/2015/FRA displayed a unique mutation at position 49 and additional mutations unexpectedly shared with CAdV-2 Toronto 26/61 and BatAdV PPV1. Few mutations also occurred in the E2 region, which is implicated in virus structure and replication, whereas an additional asparagine unique to this strain was introduced at position 292 in the pIIIa protein and an aa substitution occurred in the DNA binding protein. However, further studies would be necessary to evaluate to which extent these mutations are involved in virus-host interaction and adaptation to different hosts.",

Interestingly, the source of CAdV-1 was not recognised, while free-ranging red foxes could have carried the CAdV-2 strain into the zoological park. In recent studies (Walker et al., 2016a,b), red foxes had inapparent infections with CAdV-1, but none tested PCR positive for CAdV-2. Since most animals tested in our study were vaccinated using CAdV-2 formulations, the shedding of the vaccine virus from immunised animals could not be ruled out. Unlike modified-live CPV, whose shedding pattern has been evaluated in domestic dogs (Decaro et al., 2014; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2017), no data are available about the shedding of the CAdV-2 vaccinal strain especially in wild carnivores. Unfortunately, the viral loads detected in urine of live animals and in tissues of the dead animal prevented the sequencing of large genomic regions that could have been useful to address whether the shed virus was a vaccine or a field strain. However, the detection of CAdV-2 in carnivores vaccinated 3 years before supports the circulation of a field strain rather than the vaccine virus. This hypothesis is corroborated by the virus detection even in unvaccinated animals, since the vaccine virus is unlikely transmitted from immunised animals to other carnivores. Anyway, only future studies will help assess the extent and duration of the shedding of CAdV-2 vaccine strain in wild animals, thus ruling out definitively the possible transmission of this virus from vaccinated to CAdV naive animals. The absence of specific clinical signs and gross lesions in live and dead carnivores of the zoological park suggests that CAdV-2 can circulate in wild animals without inducing any disease. This scenario is also supported by the fact that serological studies carried out in wild carnivores of different countries indicate a widespread exposure to CAdV infection, while detection of either CAdV type in ill or dead wild animals is only sporadic (Decaro et al., 2012).",

In the Parc Animalier de Sainte-Croix a single Eurasian wolf displayed a severe CAdV-1 disease, although some animals of the same pack (pack 2) and all animals of a previously established pack (pack 1) were retrospectively found to have high CAdV antibody titres. Since those packs had not been vaccinated at the time of sampling, antibodies were the consequence of direct exposure to a field CAdV, but it was not possible to assess whether CAdV-1 or CAdV-2 was responsible for the seroconversion. Subsequent detection of CAdV-2 in the urine of 3 live captive carnivores and in internal organs of 1 dead free-ranging red fox without any CAdV-related gross lesions suggests a subclinical circulation of either or both CAdVs in the park. CAdV-2 natural infections were sporadically described in wolves (Millan et al., 2016), but only recently, Balboni et al. (2013) reported the first cases of CAdV-2 infection in healthy red foxes, which reinforces the evidence for a subclinical circulation of this adenovirus in wild carnivores. Interestingly, in our study CAdV-2 was also retrieved from internal organs of a fox, thus accounting for a systemic infection, which had been previously reported only in domestic dogs (Decaro et al., 2004). Wild foxes represent a ready interface between domestic animals and wildlife, and could therefore play an important role in CAdV epidemiology. Additional data are needed about ecology of both CAdVs in wildlife in order to better understand the potential threat represented by these canine pathogens for the conservation of endangered carnivore species.",
