An increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) affects lungs [4, 5] producing atelectasis [6], impaired function [7] and, indirectly, inflammation and edema [8]. On the other side, an increase in thoracic pressure due to MV [9] may have an effect on inflammation and edema in the abdominal compartment. In fact, the decrease in venous return related to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation [10] has been well described. In addition, a reduction on portal flow due to a vasoconstrictive reaction related directly to PEEP [11] has also been described. Consequently, MV can affect hemodynamics both systemically and locally (e.g., by enhancing hepatic production of inflammation mediators [12]).",

The hallmark of this model is a systemic inflammatory response with a substantial increase in inflammatory markers and the development of edema. Thus, these studies report the combined effect of endotoxemia and MV on abdominal edema (ascites) and inflammation. However, available data are confounded by differences in respiratory mechanics. The most important differences found in earlier research are related to a different respiratory rate (not controlled in spontaneous breathing [SB] animals) and in PEEP level application. Hence, the effect of mechanical ventilation contra SB on abdominal inflammation and edema in a non-septic model has not been investigated.",

Because ARDS is clinically caused by an underlying inflammatory condition (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia, trauma or pancreatitis), the augmentation of the pulmonary inflammation by VILI could disseminate systemically and enhance inflammation in compromised abdominal organs (such as the liver or the bowel) causing multiple organ failure [22, 23].

In a previous study PEEP in a SB group was set a 5 cmH2O and edema formation was significantly higher with MV than with SB, even when the groups had the same low PEEP level. PEEP was found to worsen edema further. That no difference was found between the SB and MV groups with a high PEEP level may indicate that high PEEP impairs edema clearance in the same way, no matter the ventilation mode. Moreover, in several studies RR was higher with SB, and it is known that diaphragm movement creates a pump effect on the thoracic duct [25].

First, this is an animal ARDS model with all its inherent limitations and the number of animals is limited in order to comply with the ARRIVE Guidelines, therefore the results can be generalized to patients only with extreme caution. The study aimed to examine whether \u201cprotective\u201d MV would induce splanchnic inflammation under non-septic ARDS conditions; however, in human patients ARDS is always due to an underlying, usually severe, inflammatory condition. Second, the observation time may have been too short to detect a full response in abdominal edema and inflammation. Nevertheless, 6 h of observation should have been enough time to see a signal in the cytokine response.",
