The virus is spread via aerosol droplets, by fecal-oral spread, by contact with contaminated fomites, through cervical/perinatal transmission, and by solid organ transplantation (kidney and liver). Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, so they can survive on surfaces for a prolonged period, and they are resistant to lipid disinfectants.",
