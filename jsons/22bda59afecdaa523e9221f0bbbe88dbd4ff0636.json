This could be explained if ascertainment of these conditions is higher using electronic primary care records for general population controls than case questionnaires. For asthma this is plausible since the case questionnaires only asked about asthma requiring medication -although free text responses include mild or childhood asthma.

The proportion of FF100 cases reporting fever was slightly lower than case series descriptions from China (2) (3) (4) (5) , although similar to the first cases of COVID-19 described in Europe (1). This may be due to the inclusion of non-hospitalised cases in this study as well as the European study. Almost half of cases reported anosmia during the course of their illness, an unexpected symptom that has been observed by others, with some suggestion that it might precede the onset of more common symptoms or be present in those with mild or asymptomatic infection (28) (29) (30) (31) . Further work is required to understand anosmia as a distinctive clinical feature of COVID-19 (30, 31) .",

In particular, a non-linear relationship with age was observed for fever which increased with age for the COVID-19 cases. Although this study included only a small number of children, our findings are congruent with other studies suggesting that children may experience milder illness with different symptoms (32-34). The different sensitivity and specificity of symptoms by age highlights the need to consider this when setting up case definitions to support public health risk assessment, clinical triage and diagnostic algorithms.",

This highlights the importance of public messaging about using online and telephone services to avoid propagating transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Forty-three percent of cases included in our study were hospitalised however this is certainly an overestimate of the case hospitalisation rate since at the beginning of the UK COVID-19 incident response all confirmed cases were hospitalised for isolation rather than clinical management purposes, and from 13 March 2020, testing was restricted to hospitalised cases only. The fact that only a small proportion of those hospitalised required mechanical ventilation in comparison with other studies supports this (2, 4) .",

Firstly, the FF100 cases are a small subset of cases that were identified at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Great Britain. They are unlikely to be representative of all GB cases of COVID-19 or of the general population, with different exposure and risk profiles. As such, the case-control study is vulnerable to selection bias. The FF100 cases are likely to be biased towards more severe cases who presented to healthcare, therefore they will underrepresent those with mild illness in the population, which may overestimate the associations between underlying health conditions and infection. The clinical presentation of FF100 cases may also differ to that of all GB cases since the imported cases (accounting for more than half of all cases) are more likely to have been of working age and may have been 'healthier' than the general population. This could conversely bias our estimates of associations between health conditions and infection downwards. The severity estimates are likely to be overestimates due to policy changes over the course of the study period, with hospitalisation of cases for isolation purposes initially and latterly restricting testing to hospitalised cases only.",
