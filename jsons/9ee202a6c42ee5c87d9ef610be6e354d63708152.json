Although a broad variety of differential diagnoses must be considered, ranging from infectious or inflammatory etiology to traumatic or neoplastic processes, the vast majority of these symptoms derive from either a viral or bacterial source. The physician must narrow the differential, decide which clinical and laboratory data may be helpful, select the most appropriate management plan for the patient's symptoms and disease process, and prevent further complications. This chapter reviews the most common causes of pharyngitis, relevant available clinical information, appropriate laboratory tests, recommended treatment guidelines, possible complications, and general strategies for evaluating patients with acute pharyngitis.",

If the patient meets two, three, or four of the criteria, a diagnostic laboratory test is indicated. Some physicians will begin antibiotic therapy presumptively for patients with severe symptoms who meet three or four of the Centor criteria, and may not send a diagnostic test in addition to testing. The absence of three or four criteria has a negative predictive value near 80%. 4, 14 The Centor Clinical Prediction Rules are endorsed by the IDSA and listed currently among the CDC recommendations online at: www.cdc/gov/drugresistance/ community/files/ads/Acute_Pharyngitis.pdf.",

These include Kawasaki disease, trauma or exertional irritation, neoplastic processes, abscess (such as Ludwig's angina, parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal, and peritonsillar), thyroiditis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or allergy-related postnasal drip. 18 Pharyngitis secondary to GERD or allergies would likely accompany symptoms of dyspepsia or nasal congestion with postnasal drip, respectively. Trauma or throat strain caused by overuse (shouting, for example) should be elicited via the patient's history of symptom onset. Neoplastic processes can be more subtle, but may have accompanying weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, or dysphagia. An abscess would likely cause higher fevers, more discomfort, and persistent symptoms despite typical first-line antibiotic treatment. Airway compromise, hoarseness, or neck swelling may accompany abscesses depending on their location. Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 3 years of age, and is defined by a number of well-documented features, including pharyngeal erythema, strawberry tongue, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, cracked red lips, and erythema and swelling of the hands and feet with desquamation of periungual regions several days after symptom onset.",

Nonsuppurative complications are reflective of streptococcal toxins, streptolysins, and inflammatory processes involving antibodies targeted at the bacteria.
