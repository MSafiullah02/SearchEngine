            "text": "260 The prevalence of RSV among patients aged 18-59 years (4.2%) was low when compared to the 261 prevalence reported by Hall et al. when focussing on symptomatic cases (6%). However, while we 262 focused on adults presenting to primary care with acute respiratory infection (ARI)-like complaints, 263 Hall et al. sampled individuals that were included in their study weekly, with RSV positive individuals 264 eligible who would not usually consult their GP (Hall et al. 2001). The prevalence of influenza among 265 patients aged 18-59 years (12.2%) was close to the prevalence reported by Chl\u00edbek et al. (11.5%). 266 The prevalence of RSV among patients aged 60 years and older (5.9%) was high when compared to 267 the prevalence reported by Nicholson et al. (3.4% of illness episodes). Also the prevalence of 268 influenza among patients aged 60 years and older (6.3%) was high when compared to the prevalence 269 reported by Nicholson et al. (4.4% of illness episodes). However, while we included adults with acute 270 cough or other signs of LRTI, Nicholson et al. also included patients with symptoms such as earache, 271 face ache and gritty eyes, which are less common in RSV or influenza infection (Nicholson et al. 272 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f illness cases). This is not unexpected, as Falsey et al. contacted participating individuals weekly, 274 hence also including RSV and influenza positive patients that might not have visited their GP on their 275 own initiative. While the influenza prevalence reported by Falsey et al. approaches ours, the 276 prevalence of RSV is dissimilar, suggesting that influenza positive patients are more likely to consult 277 their GP compared to RSV positive patients. A finding which is corroborated by the importance of 278 interference with normal activities of work in influenza but not RSV (Table 3). In addition to health 279 care system accessibility characteristics, any in-depth cross-country comparison of influenza 280 prevalence would need to carefully consider differences arising from different intensities of included 281 influenza seasons, different vaccine efficacies for these seasons and different vaccination coverage 282 rates by age. 283 The most recent estimates for patients aged 60 years and older we could find in the current 284 literature are those reported by Belongia et al. Both for RSV (10.8%) and for influenza (23.0%), their 285 reported prevalence was higher than the prevalence we reported. However, even though both 286 studies focused on patients presenting with ARI-like complaints, we included only outpatients while 287 Belongia et al. included both in-and outpatients, making a direct comparison invalid (Belongia et al. 288 2018b). 289 Diagnosing RSV or influenza was significantly less likely when another virus was detected. This 290 corresponds with findings by other authors. Shinjoh et al. showed that the growth of RSV is blocked 291 by coinfection with influenza in vitro (Shinjoh et al. 2000). Also in vivo, RSV epidemics have been 292 known to be interrupted by influenza epidemics (Anestad 1982, 1987; Nishimura et al. 2005). Other 293 interferences have also been observed, e.g. RSV can reduce infections with rhinovirus, rhinovirus can 294 reduce infections with adenovirus, parainfluenza and influenza,\u2026(Greer et al. 2009; Casalegno et al.",

For this reason, GPs should take age into account when following 306 up their patients and further research on the management of RSV or influenza infections should at 307 least distinguish between patients under and over 60 years of age. 308 309 Funding 310 RB is funded as a postdoctoral researcher by the Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO).

Primary care 88 research networks were located in 12 European countries (Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, 89 the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Wales). Exclusion criteria were 90 pregnancy, consumption of antibiotics in the previous month and any condition associated with 91 immunodeficiency. For this secondary analysis, patients without etiology results were excluded. 92 GPs reported the patient's symptoms and comorbidities in a case report form on the day of 93 consultation. For each patient, two nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were taken, which were transported 94 to the central lab at the University hospital (Antwerp, Belgium). Presence of bacterial pathogens 95 (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia 96 pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumoniae) and viral pathogens (RSV and 97 influenza, but also rhinovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, 98 polyomavirus and bocavirus) was assessed using bacterial cultures, serology and/or in-house 99 polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) as described before (Ieven et al. 2018). The presence of 100 pneumonia was assessed in all patients using chest radiography (van Vugt et al. 2013). 101In addition, patients filled out a symptom diary each day until their symptoms cleared, up to a 102 maximum of 28 days. Among other features, they rated the severity of cough, shortness of breath, 103 wheezing, runny nose, chest pain, fever, disturbed sleep and interference with normal activities or 104 problem is as bad as it could be). A review of their primary care medical records was performed to 106 extract information on re-consultation with new or worsened symptoms or admission to hospital 107 within four weeks of the initial consultation. 108We assessed the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and illness course of RSV and 110 influenza infection. The data were categorized in three age groups: 18 -59 years, 60-74 years and 75 111 years and older. Prevalence of RSV and influenza was defined as the number of positive cases out of 112 the total number of patients with available PCR results for RSV and influenza, respectively. For the 113 country-specific prevalence, England and Wales were combined into 'UK'. Because patients were 114 clustered within countries, virus-specific association of age with prevalence was assessed using a 115 hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM)(Verbeke and Molenberghs 2009). A Tukey multiple 116 comparisons correction was used to compare prevalence between age groups (Tukey 1991). 117Diagnosis of RSV and influenza infection was defined as a PCR positive NPS result for the respective 118 virus.

The odds of illness deterioration was compared using an additional adjustedHGLM.  140    Due to data sparseness, the analyses were adjusted for significant covariates only (univariate p-value 141 < 0.10). Covariates that were considered include gender (male/female), history of pulmonary 142 comorbidities (yes/no), history of cardiac comorbidities (yes/no), current smoker (yes/no), received 143 influenza vaccination (yes/no), number of days coughing before consultation, detection of bacteria 144 and detection of viruses other than the studied virus (yes/no). The average symptom severity (as 145 assessed by the GP at consultation) was considered as an additional covariate in the analyses of 146 analysed samples; 3 influenza A, 2 influenza B, 1 type not determined). Other baseline characteristics 155 are reported inTable 1. 156 Baseline characteristics for adult acute cough patients in primary care. covariates, the prevalence of RSV remained associated with age (p=0.0264, OR: 2.27, 95% CI: [1.12 -163 4.64]). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 2. 164 The prevalence of influenza infection also differed between the three age groups (p<0.0001): 243 165 positive. The patients aged 60 years and older were significantly less likely to test positive for 169 influenza A when compared to patients aged 18-59 years (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: [0.31 -0.83] and OR: 170 0.33, 95% CI: [0.11 -0.95], respectively). Patients aged 60-74 years were significantly less likely to 171 test positive for influenza B when compared to patients aged 18-59 years (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: [0.28 -172 0.99]). After accounting for significant covariates, the odds of influenza was not associated with age 173 anymore (p=0.2179 for influenza A and p=0.7330 for influenza B). Odds ratios and 95% confidence 174 intervals are reported in Table 2. 175 Diagnostic value of patient characteristics 177 The odds of RSV was significantly lower when the patient was a current smoker (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 178 [0.44-0.99]). After accounting for significant covariates, the odds of RSV was no longer associated 179 with smoking status (p=0.3534; Table 3). 180 The odds of influenza A was significantly lower when the patient was current smoker (OR: 0.68, 95% 181 CI: [0.47-0.99] or had a history of cardiac comorbidities (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: [0.19-0.87]). The odds of 182 influenza B was significantly lower when the patient had a history of pulmonary comorbidities (OR: 183 0.48, 95% CI: [0.24-0.95]). After accounting for significant covariates, the odds of Influenza was no 184 longer associated with a history of pulmonary (p=0.1026) or cardiac (p=0.2798) comorbidities (Table 185 3). The association between the odds of influenza A and smoking status remained significant (OR: 186 0.60, 95% CI: [0.40-0.89]). However, this association was not associated with age (p=0.0799). 187 Diagnostic value of presenting symptoms 188 The odds of RSV was significantly higher when the patient presented with a runny nose (OR: 1.95, 189 95% CI: [1.25-3.02]). After accounting for significant covariates, the association between the odds of 190 RSV and the presence of a runny nose remained significant (OR: 2.42, 95% CI: [1.54-3.78]; Table 3). 191 However, this association was not associated with age (p=0.2508). 192 Fever both -wheezing B only -interference normal activities both 193 The odds of influenza A was significantly higher when the patient presented with fever (OR: 4.79, 194 95% CI: [3.41-6.74]) or interference with normal activities or work (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: [1.40-2.94]). The 195 odds of influenza B was significantly higher when the patient presented with fever (OR: 4.17, 95% CI: 196 [2.74-6.35]), without wheezing (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: [1.13-2.74]) or interference with normal activities 197 or work (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: [1.87-5.40]). After accounting for significant covariates, the association 1.65, 95% CI: [1.12-2.44] for influenza A, (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: [1.59-4.78] for influenza B) remained 201 significant (Table 3). However, neither the association with fever (p=0.4816 for influenza A and 202 p=0.3638 for influenza B) nor the association with interference with normal activities or work 203 (p=0.7193 for influenza A and p=0.0732 for influenza B) was associated with age. 204 The odds of both RSV and influenza were significantly lower when another virus was detected (OR: 206 for influenza B). After accounting for significant covariates, the association between the 208 odds of both RSV and influenza and the presence of another virus remained significant (OR: 0.18, 209 95% CI: [0.12-0.29] for RSV, OR: 0.17, 95% CI: [0.11-0.26] for influenza A and OR: 0.10, 95% CI: [0.06-210 0.19] for influenza B; Table 3). However, these associations were not associated with age (p=0.3087, 211 p=0.9828 and p=0.6462, respectively). 212 Association of age with the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Influenza virus infection among adult acute cough patients in primary care. Diagnostic value of patient characteristics, presenting symptoms and additional testing in adult acute cough patients in primary care that tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or Influenza virus. Duration of symptoms after the initial consultation (days) in adult acute cough patients that tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or Influenza virus in primary care.Out of the patients that tested positive for RSV, 123 (85.4%) completed their diary. Among patients 220 that tested positive for influenza A or B, 138 (82.6%) and 89 (86.4%), respectively, completed their 221 diary. Four patients that returned their diary tested positive for both RSV and influenza (two 222 influenza A and two influenza B). 223 patient no longer experienced shortness of breath was 70.9% (95% CI: [6.9%-173%]) longer in the 225 patients aged 75 years and older when compared to patients aged 18-59 years. Also, the median 226 time until the patient no longer experienced a runny nose was 52.2% (95% CI: [9.5%-143.5%]) longer 227 in patients aged 60-74 years when compared to patients aged 18-59 years. 228For influenza A, the time until resolution of symptoms was not associated with age (Table 4). For 229 influenza B, the time until resolution of symptoms was associated with age: the median time until the 230 For RSV, the odds of unresolved shortness of breath was significantly higher in patients aged 60-74 234 years (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: [1.04-4.30]) and patients aged 75 years and older (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: [1.31-235 6.44]) when compared to patients aged 18-59 years (Table 5). Also the odds of an unresolved runny 236 nose (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: [1.09-4.49]) and interference with normal activities or work (OR: 2.56, 95% 237 CI: [1.08-5.39]) was significantly higher in patients aged 60-74 years when compared to patients aged 238 18-59 years. For influenza A, the odds of unresolved symptoms was not associated with age. Data 239 were too sparse to draw conclusions for the association between age and the odds of unresolved 240 symptoms for influenza B. 241 Unresolved symptoms after 28 days in adult acute cough patients that tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus 242 (RSV) or Influenza virus in primary care.For RSV, 22.1% (N=27) experienced illness deterioration, which was defined as re-consultation with 245 new or worsened complaints (N=27) or admission to hospital (N=1) within 28 days of the initial 246 consultation. Patients aged 75 years and older were at increased risk of illness deterioration when 247 compared to patients aged 18-59 years (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: [1.04-4.64]). For influenza A, 17.4% (N=22) 24819.5% (N=17) experienced illness deterioration (re-consultation with new or worsened complaints 250 (N=16) or admission to hospital (N=1)).
