            "text": "Autophagy is a major cellular pathway involved in the degradation of decaying organelles and expired proteins inside eukaryotic cells [1, 2]. To date, three major autophagy pathways have been described: macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone\u2010mediated autophagy [3]. In this review we will focus on macroautophagy and refer to it as autophagy hereafter. Although autophagy was initially described as a process carried out for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis [1, 2], accumulating studies have also provided data that associate alterations in autophagy components with important diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, chronic autoimmune\u2010inflammatory syndromes and infectious diseases [4, 5]. Because a role for autophagy in pathogen control has also been suggested by various studies, important research efforts are currently being invested on better characterizing the contribution of this process to antiviral immunity. Indeed, autophagy has been proposed to work as an intrinsic cell immune defense mechanism against viral infections by targeting intracellular pathogens, such as viruses, for degradation [6]. Paradoxically, certain viruses and other pathogens seem to rely on autophagy elements to replicate and persist inside the host. Thus, viruses have evolved molecular strategies to exploit and modulate the function of autophagy components to use them for their benefit [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Some of these findings are discussed below in this article.",

            "text": "Autophagy is a process that requires the concerted assembly of multiple proteins into molecular complexes that carry out sequential steps with defined functions [2]. The identification of autophagy components was significantly advanced due to the use of yeast genetic screening assays. Indeed, multiple autophagy\u2010related proteins (Atgs) have been identified using the yeast genetic screening assay with further mammalian counterparts being defined in other systems [12]. The major common physiological activator of autophagy is starvation and growth factor deprivation [2]. However, immune\u2010inflammation signals can also lead to an increase in autophagy [13], as well as the expression of several proteins involved in this process (Fig. 1\n). mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin, has been shown to be involved in the negative modulation of autophagy [14]. It is thought that mTOR keeps both, Unc51\u2010like kinase 1 (ULK1) and Atg13 in a hyperphosphorylated state within the ULK1\u2010Atg13\u2010FAK family\u2010interacting protein of 200 kD (FIP200) complex [15]. Stimuli that promote autophagy, such as nutrient starvation and pathogen infections, initiate mTOR\u2010mediated desphosphorylation of ULK\u20101 and Atg13, leading to the dissociation of mTOR from the FIP200 complex [15]. Avibirnavirus and human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) have been described to induce autophagy in a mTOR\u2010dependent manner [16, 17]. MTOR dephosphorylation activates autophagy, initiating the nucleation of a cellular membrane (lipid bilayer) that will ultimately become the autophagosome. This enveloping membrane has been named as the \u201cisolation membrane\u201d or \u201cphagophore\u201d [18]. Importantly, it has been proposed that the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria may be the suppliers of lipid bilayers that form the phagophore [19, 20, 21]. To promote the formation of this membrane, the class III phosphoinositide\u20103\u2010kinase (PIK3) complex, which is composed of vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34), Atg14 and Beclin\u20101, is recruited to the phagophore [18]. Indeed, Beclin\u20101 is a scaffolding protein for the regulation of the PIK3 pathway [22]. Alternatively, the UV irradiation resistance\u2010associated gene (UVRAG) may induce this PI3K complex [23] and promotes Atg9 trafficking [24]. Although Atg9 has been shown to be essential for starvation\u2010induced autophagy [25], the specific function of this transmembrane protein remains somewhat unknown. During the first steps of phagophore generation, Vps34 is recognized by the beta\u2010transducin repeat domain (WD) phosphoinositide\u2010interacting protein 1 (WIPI\u20101), which cooperates with Atg2 and Atg9 to form of this structure [26]. These events trigger a downstream Atg conjugation system, which regulates autophagosome elongation [18].",

            "text": "Subsequently, autophagosome formation is catalyzed by two ubiquitin\u2010like conjugation systems: the Atg12\u2010Atg5\u2010ATG16L and Atg4B\u2010Atg3\u2010Atg7 complexes [27, 28]. As part of this process, light chain 3 (LC3) precursor is cleaved by Atg4B to produce a cytosolic form (LC3 I) and later converted into a membrane\u2010bound form (LC3 II), which is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through the activity of Atg7 and Atg3 [29, 30, 31]. The Atg12\u2010Atg5\u2010ATG16L complex in turn acts as an E3\u2010like enzyme and determine particular sites for LC3 lipidation [32]. Gamma\u2010aminobutyric acid receptor\u2010associated protein (GABARAP) and Golgi\u2010associated ATPase enhancer of 16kDa (GATE\u201016) are homologs of LC3 and are involved in the late stages of autophagosome maturation [33]. P62 (also known as the sequestosome, SQSTM1) and the curvature\u2010driving protein (Bif\u20101) are ubiquitination\u2010binding proteins that contribute also to this maturation process [34]. Bif\u20101 also interacts with Beclin\u20101 through UVRAG as a positive regulator, aiding to autophagosome formation [35]. Importantly, conversion from LC3\u2010I to LC3\u2010II has been extensively used as a marker of autophagy [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Concomitantly, because p62 accumulates when autophagy is inhibited, this protein has also been used as an autophagic flux marker [41]. Once the autophagosome is formed, it fuse with the lysosome to form the autolysosome through the recruitment of the soluble N\u2010ethylmaleimide\u2010sensitive factor attachment (NSF) protein receptor (SNARE), protein syntaxin 17 (Stx17) and interact with the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex [42, 43]. HOPS is a class\u2010C Vps complex which is composed by Vps11, Vps16, Vps18, Vps33, Vps39 and Vps41. The vesicle trafficking process that occurs during this fusion is regulated by GTPases such as Ras superfamily of monomeric G protein (Rab) 7, Rab8b and Rab24 [44]. At the end of the process, specific components, such as decaying organelles and expired proteins are trapped inside the autophagolysosome and degraded [1].",

Several TLRs are known to activate innate responses after virus infection, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 [45, 46]. TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed on the cell surface whereas TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 are localized within cytoplasmatic compartments, such as endosomes [47, 48, 49]. TLR activation within endosomes requires endocytosis of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral RNA molecules, damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), apoptotic cells or the induction of autophagy [50, 51]. Several viruses can evade immediate recognition by TLRs after entering cells through endosome\u2010associated compartments, thereby delaying the onset of an immune response [50]. TLR signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB), interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)\u20103 and IRF\u20107 and the assembly of inflammasome to activate caspase\u20101 and further process pro\u2010interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 into their active forms [52]. Upon viral RNA detection, cytosolic PRRs, for instance Nod domain 2 (Nod2), RNA helicases such as melanoma differentiation\u2010association gene\u20105 (MDA5), and RIG\u2010I are activated [53]. RIG\u2010I interacts with the adaptor interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b2 promoter stimulator (IPS\u20101; also known as MAVS, VISA or CARDIF) on the mitochondrial membrane, and consequently activates the transcription factors IRF\u20103 and NF\u2010\u03baB, leading to the production of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and other cytokines (Fig. 2\n). IPS\u20101 has been shown to contribute to the type\u2010I IFN\u2010mediated mechanisms of antiviral host defense [50]. This notion is supported by the observation that IPS\u20101\u2010knockout mice show an increased recruitment of inflammatory neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) in the lungs after human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection [50], evidencing the importance of this adaptor in antiviral responses for the clearance of hRSV. The papain\u2010like protease 2 (PLP2) protein from coronaviruses promotes Beclin\u20101 association with STING [10]. Another protein that has been shown to regulate autophagy and the antiviral defense is Tripartite motif protein family (TRIM) [54], which blocks IRF\u20103/7 via serine/threonine protein kinase (TBK1) and NF\u2010\u03baB [55]. In addition, TRIMs associate with autophagy factors. Indeed, TRIM5 was found to recognize and target human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV\u20101) for destruction [56].",

Indeed, RIG\u20101 has been described to be modulated by Atgs activated by viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [57]. For instance, embryonic fibroblasts from Atg5\u2010deficient mouse were shown to be resistant to VSV replication, suggesting that autophagy components can contribute to viral replication in host cells. The constitutive overexpression of a mutant of RIG\u20101 induced the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB and IFN\u2010\u03b2, which was suppressed by the co\u2010expression of the Atg5\u2010Atg12 complex [57]. This suppression seemed to be dependent on infection with VSV and was reported to induce a conformational change in RIG\u20101 [57]. Nucleotide\u2010binding domain and leucine\u2010rich\u2010repeats containing proteins (NLRX1), as well as the mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM) in turn have been shown to modulate autophagy via RIG\u20101 signaling and activation of IFN\u2010I, as well as the association with the Atg5\u2010Atg12 complex and ATG16L [60]. The induction of autophagy by NLRX1 was specifically shown in VSV\u2010infected peritoneal macrophages from nlrxl knockout mice [60]. Similarly, it was shown that IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced phagosomes were directed to lysosomes for degradation in hepatitis B virus (HPV) infection in a non\u2010structural serine protease 3(NS3)/4A transgenic mouse model [61].",

Autophagy has also been shown to be important for the production of cytokines produced from innate immune cells. Indeed, blockade of autophagy by the 3\u2010methyladenine (3\u2010MA) inhibitor in DCs infected with hRSV has been shown to prevent the expression of interferons, chemokines and cytokines, such as IFN\u2010\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, C\u2010C motif ligands 5 (CCL5), IL\u20106, and IL\u201012p35, but not IL\u20101b [66].

            "text": "In addition to playing a role during innate immune responses to virus infections, autophagy also contributes to the regulation of adaptive immune responses against these and other pathogens. For instance, autophagy contributes to antigen presentation to T cells by antigen presenting cells and is required for an effective initiation of the adaptive immune response [11, 67, 69]. Indeed, presentation of pathogen\u2010derived peptides on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules to CD4+ T cells has been reported to be facilitated by autophagy [70] (Fig. 3\n). Antigen acquired by phagocytosis will be degraded into peptides by the autophagosome and eventually loaded onto MHC molecules [71]. The peptide\u2010MHC (pMHC) complexes generated are then transported to the cell surface and presented to CD4+ T cells. In contrast to antigen presentation on MHC\u2010II molecules, antigen presentation on MHC\u2010I molecules can be mediated by two pathways in which only one involves autophagy. During conventional MHC\u2010I antigen presentation, endogenous protein antigens are degraded into peptidic fragments by the proteasome and then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are translocated to the lumen through the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) [71]. Once in the endoplasmic reticulum, peptides are loaded onto MHC\u2010I molecules and then transported to the surface for presentation to CD8+ T cells [71]. It has been suggested that the alternative pathway for antigen presentation on MHC\u2010I molecules, called cross\u2010presentation, may require autophagy components [72, 73, 74]. Cross\u2010presentation consists on the presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC I molecules to CD8+ T cells [71]. This pathway has been reported practically in every type of immune response, such as tumor immunity [74], autoimmunity [75] and microbial infections, such as in macrophage infection by HSV\u20101 [72], as well as DCs stimulated with the yellow fever vaccine [73]. Furthermore, it has been shown that viral proteins undergo vacuolar processing in autophagosomes, which is followed by proteasome degradation and peptide loading on MHC\u2010I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum [72]. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in vacuolar processing of viral proteins remains unknown.",

Along these lines, it has been shown that human hepatitis virus C (HVC) reduces cathepsin S through IRF\u20101 and upstream stimulatory factor (UPS\u20101), thereby altering the degradation of the invariant chain and consequently antigen presentation [76]. Similarly, LC3\u2010deficient DCs show a significant impairment in their capacity to present HIV\u20101\u2010derived antigens to CD4+ T cells [69]. Epstein\u2010Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA\u20101) has been shown to inhibit autophagy, thereby decreasing recognition by EBNA\u20101\u2010specific CD4+ T cell clones [77]. An association between autophagy and adaptive immunity is suggested by observation that Atg5\u2010deficient DCs fail at presenting antigens on MHC class II molecules, as well as at priming and promoting the proliferation of T cells in vivo after HSV infection [65]. However, abrogation of Atg5 in DCs had no effect on antigen cross\u2010presentation on MHC class I molecules, suggesting that Atg5 is not essential for this pathway [65]. Interestingly, phagosomes coated with LC3 protein maintain antigens for prolonged periods of time, favoring antigen presentation on MHC class II molecules [78]. Recently, a Beclin\u20101+/\u2212 mouse showed that loss of autophagy function could lead to decreased MHC\u2010II expression after hRSV infection and failure to produce IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201017, thereby impairing both DC maturation, as well as the onset of an effective antiviral adaptive immune response against this virus [67].

Such a construction caused that Gag localizes to the autophagosome and lysosomes, which promotes presentation in MHC\u2010II molecules. This strategy was shown to significantly improve the immunogenicity of HIV antigens and the induction of an adaptive immune responses upon infection [81]. Along these lines, other novel strategies have been undertaken to enhance antigen presentation and immune response induction. For instance, a peptide derived from HSV that induces autophagosomal degradation of antigens was implemented to protect from tumor challenge [82]. Such a peptide could be attached to antigenic viral proteins for vaccine design, as a manner to enhance immunogenicity. However, as noted above not all autophagy proteins are essential for antigen presentation, as Atg7\u2010deficient thymocytes and DCs showed no alterations in any antigen presentation pathway for exogenous or endogenous antigens [83]. Taken together, these studies provide an important link between antigen presentation of virus\u2010derived proteins and the autophagosome function in antigen presenting cells.

It has been suggested that an inefficient fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes in HSV\u2010infected cells is induced by oxidative stress and has been associated with neurodegeneration [88]. In addition, \u03b334.5 has been shown to be important for HSV virulence in the brain of adult and neonatal animals and dependent on type\u2010I IFN only in adults [89]. HCV has also been reported to induce autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to an accumulation of autophagosomes that require the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) [90, 91]. Interestingly, serum from HCV\u2010infected patients has been reported to block autophagy in differentiating monocytes suggesting the participation of soluble components in sera with this particular capacity [11]. In contrast, varicella\u2010zoster virus (VZV) promotes a complete autophagy process, which has been evidenced by the degradation of some of its long\u2010lived proteins [92]. Autophagy in this latter case seems to be used by the virus to facilitate VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing [92]. Similar to VZV, measles virus (MeV) increases autophagy but prevents the degradation of viral proteins [93]. Interestingly, MeV\u2010induced autophagy is required for the replication of the virus. In addition, enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus and rotavirus have also been reported to interact with autophagy elements to evade immunity by increasing respectively protein\u2010 and calcium\u2010activated signaling in infected cells [94, 95, 96]. Another example of virus exploitation of the autophagy machinery is provided by adenoviruses [97]. These pathogens replicate more efficiently in the airways when epithelial cells undergo nutrient deprivation\u2010induced autophagy [97]. The mechanisms used by other viruses that induce autophagy, such as dengue and parvovirus B19 remain to be undetermined [98, 99].",

Among these proteins, immunity\u2010associated GTPase family M (IRGM) was a common target for all the viruses studied [100]. Importantly, autophagosome accumulation due to the inhibition of autophagosome\u2010lysosome fusion in MeV, HCV and HIV was shown to be IRGM\u2010dependent by confocal microscopy [100].

Therefore, it is likely that this virus may be interacting differently with the autophagy components depending on the cell type encountered. Similar to mHPV, infectious bronchitis virus induces the formation of autophagosomes when inhibited through the silencing of Atg5 [105].

The M2 influenza protein, which plays important roles in several steps of influenza virus infection, which works as a proton channel and has been shown to be key for the modulation of autophagy in infected cells [8, 39]. While M2\u2010transfected cells showed autophagosome accumulation, calls transfected with other influenza A virus proteins did not show alterations of the autophagy pathways [39]. In addition, M2 has been shown to interact with LC3 and promotes its LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane [39]. Along these lines, different compounds with anti\u2010influenza activity have been shown to either block or modulate autophagy, by altering host\u2010virus protein interactions [40, 106]. Indeed, the replication of influenza within the autophagosome may be reduced by blocking the induction of autophagy. Baicalin, a flavonoid compound with antiviral properties, shows inhibitory activity over autophagy by inhibiting mTOR signaling and Atg5\u2010Atg12 during influenza infection [106].

Interestingly, Atg5 disruption in neurons did not vary viral titers in the central nervous system, suggesting that Atg5 does not play an essential role in the clearance of Sindbis virus, at least in these cells [59]. On the other hand, simian immunodeficiency virus type I\u2010infected microglia inhibits neuronal autophagy, thereby decreasing neuron survival [109]. An association between autophagy and apoptosis and cell death derives from the interaction of Beclin\u20101 with the major anti\u2010apoptotic B\u2010cell lymphoma (Bcl) family protein [110]. These observations suggest that autophagy has been shown to be critical for blocking cell death in virus\u2010infected neurons.

HPV induces autophagy and exploits the components of this cellular process for genome replication and viral envelope formation. However, the mechanisms involved in the interactions between autophagy components and virus determinants remains controversial [115, 116]. For instance, HPV utilizes some of the host's autophagy machinery molecules to release its naked viral capsids, requiring for example Rab33B, a GTPase that participates in autophagosome formation via the Atg5\u2010Atg12\u2010ATG16L complex [117].

While autophagy may help to eliminate pathogens, it can also could work as a reservoir for pathogen growth and escape from apoptosis or cell death. However, consistent with an important role for autophagy during viral infections, viruses have evolved different mechanisms to counteract this cellular process. Because of its involvement during viral infections, autophagy is actively being explored as a cellular target for the development of vaccines and therapies for preventing virus spread or dissemination [81, 82, 118]. Undoubtedly, further research is required to understand the interactions occurring between components of autophagy and the immune system.
