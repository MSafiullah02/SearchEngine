            "text": "In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and it continues to threaten public health. This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical interventions. All mobility metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states and becomes more stable after the stay-at-home order with a smaller range of fluctuation. There exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. The study suggests that the public mobility trends conform with the government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers.",

Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the world is experiencing unprecedented phenomena. 1 In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and emergency measures have been internationally implemented as the outbreak continues to threaten public health. As of April 10, 2020, there were almost 1\u00b77 million worldwide confirmed cases of COVID-19, with the United States accounting for over 500,000 cases, or around 30% of overall infections around the world. 2 As a result, over 40 American states have instituted stay-at-home orders, making quarantine and social distancing the new norm for the majority of the U.S. population.",

            "text": "Interdisciplinary research has been actively conducted to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its adverse impacts on society. Epidemiologic measurements have been explored to identify the dynamics of disease regarding the spread risk and the effect of human mobility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In addition, since the mobility restrictions are considered as a critical factor to prevent the disease spread, studies have assessed its impact. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Nonpharmaceutical observations are also proven to be effective data sources to have an integrated perspective. Especially big data allow for increased understanding of human behavior changes in response to the spread of the virus. One recent study captures the dissemination of COVID-19 information in relation to the outbreak progression from crowdsourced data. 17 Other studies employing data-driven methodologies have also been introduced to estimate the negative impacts on various sectors such as the economy, public health, and human mobility. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In particular, mobility data have been identified as being especially relevant and researchers have provided in-depth knowledge on how to leverage mobile device location data for analyzing COVID-19 propagation. [23] [24] [25] Technology companies have presented insights on mobility trends by exploiting location data as well. [26] [27] [28] As revealed from literature, there exists the importance of social distancing and timely decision on mobility interventions to slow the pandemic. The key factor to stop the virus is those classical approaches including social distancing, quarantine, and mobility interventions since no treatment is currently available. 13 However, little is known about the gap between social distance advocacy and the actual practices among the general populace. 23 There also has been scant research on public reactions to COVID-19 as well as the interventions on mobility. Realizing the urgent needs on understanding mobility trends amid the pandemic, as one of the pioneering big data-driven studies on COVID-19, we aim to quantify changes in human mobility to provide tangible and intuitive evidence on individual and governmental efforts to migrate the spread. The goal of the study is two-fold. First, we explore large-scale public mobility patterns and the existence of heterogeneity across the nation by leveraging mobile device location data. Our study covers: temporal trend analysis before and after the emergence of COVID-19 and mobility interventions; geospatial trend analysis at national and state levels in the U.S.; and groupwise comparisons regarding sociodemographic characteristics. Second, we uncover potential research areas that can greatly contribute to the current and potential future matters with the observed evidence. While this paper does not intend to establish a complete guidance on how governments or similar bodies should respond, the hope is to share our observations and findings to provide an integrated perspective on the public mobility reactions before and during the pandemic.",

            "text": "Sociodemographic groupwise trends Next, we further demonstrate the mobility trends featured by sociodemographic groups. Median income level and population density show a notable clustering nature, which we choose to deliver in this paper. It is of great importance to mention that any features should not be singled out as the only contributing factor without theoretical grounds and rigorous research. Yet, several interesting findings are observed in relation to COVID-19. Figure  7 (b) demonstrates miles traveled per person in the order of population density (lower). The mobility pattern gradually becomes distinguishable between the two groups upon the COVID-19 outbreak. Until the national emergency declared on March 13 (grey line), states share a relatively homogeneous staying home trend regardless of the sociodemographic features, while one can pinpoint a more distinctive trend thereafter. The higher income group tends to present a higher staying-at-home ratio and higher density group present lower trip distance after the outbreak. Even though the income level or population density may not be the only factors that affect the mobility trend, there exists overall heterogeneity between the groups. Figure 8 illustrates groupwise mobility patterns in three measures. One point to note is that two income groups exchange their trip distance trend around mid-March (grey bar) (Figure 8(a) ). The high-income states tend to travel longer distances before the pandemic, while the low-income group surpasses later. The higher income group tends to stay at home slightly more before the outbreak, but the gap becomes more notable afterwards. The percentage of out-of-county trips relatively stays similar between groups. However, the high-income group traveled slightly more to out-of-county locations, whereas the difference becomes obscure after mid-March. The percentage of people staying home trend also exhibits a similar pattern until mid-March (grey bar) between two population density groups (Figure 8(b) ). Afterwards, the higher density group reduces their mobility noticeably. One might assume that the higher chances of contacting other people in the higher density area result in practicing social distancing more actively. Both before and after the outbreak, the lower density states sustain higher miles traveled and lower out-of-country trip rates. Different from income comparison, no metrics exchange the trends and, instead, the gaps in miles traveled and out-of-county trips are more noticeable between the groups throughout the whole study period.

This estimate is based on the work trip frequency per person and weekly unemployment claims from the United States Department of Labor. 33 For this demonstration, we first divide employees into two categories: teleworkers and commuters. Their initial relative ratio is estimated per state based on the American Community Survey (ACS) report. 34 Total number of employees ( + ) in the benchmark week are obtained based on the weekly unemployment claims. Commuters in the benchmark week are estimated as the product of commuter ratio and total employees. Assuming that the work trip rate per person is consistent within a short time period, we calculate the number of commuters by dividing the number of work trips by the work trip rate per person. Then, the number of teleworkers per week is estimated ( \u2212 \u2212 ) with an assumption that there is no additional weekly employment during COVID-19. Here, the number of weekly unemployed populations are estimated based on the unemployment claims.",

            "text": "Despite our naive approach and assumptions, the estimates still conform with the pandemic circumstances. The teleworking rate starts to increase around mid-March complying with the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, in which the baseline is set on the week of March 7 ( Figure 9 ). As of April 4, the number of employees working from home increases by 25%, compared to the baseline week. The teleworking rate in some states stops increasing and even decreases in April. Two possible assumptions account for this trend: employees who no longer conduct teleworking and work on site or are no longer hired. One drawback to our estimation is that it does not separate the population who are on a break from teleworkers, which is the possible reason for the higher teleworking rate in the first week of January. Overall, we anticipate more research is invited to scrutinize this teleworking trend regarding COVID-19 and rapidly inclining unemployment rates, which marks the highest increase in the seasonally adjusted series report history. 35 In addition, as the teleworking trend has not been observed to this extreme extent before, further research will help provide essential evidence on the economic crisis.",

In addition, as we observe the clear evidence on social distancing efforts, a rigorous modeling approach will be necessary to quantify the social distancing trends and to analyze the reasons behind. Also, our observation could be also integrated with the pharmaceutical modeling research. While carefully suggesting the potential and necessary research areas that can greatly help the current and potential future matters, we anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated insights on human mobility trends regarding the pandemic circumstances. This study could serve as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers.",
