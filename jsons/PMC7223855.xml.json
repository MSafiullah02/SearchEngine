            "text": "Despite numerous therapeutic innovations, infection-related mortality in critically ill patients persists as a significant healthcare concern. Given the corresponding high burden of infection, it is unsurprising that the consumption of antimicrobial agents (antibacterials, antifungals and antivirals) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is ten times higher than in other wards [1]. It is essential to optimise the use of antimicrobial agents not only to maximise therapeutic success but also to prolong the clinical lifespan of these currently available drugs by limiting the emergence of resistance [2]. However, the process of optimising antimicrobial therapy (including both spectrum and therapeutic exposure) is a massive challenge in ICU patients, who often manifest extreme inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability [3]. It follows that conventional antimicrobial dosing may risk clinical failure in this patient population as most dose-finding studies only included non-ICU populations. Indeed, perhaps more than in any other patient population, non-optimised antimicrobial dosing may more commonly lead to low drug exposure and therapeutic failure and/or antimicrobial resistance [4], or high drug exposure, leading to an increased risk of toxicity.",

Traditionally, TDM was only employed to minimise the likelihood of toxicity in drugs with narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. aminoglycosides and vancomycin) and in drugs with complex pharmacokinetics (e.g. voriconazole) and has been hitherto underused for other antimicrobials. However, the recent surge in multidrug-resistant pathogens causing infections, combined with a declining antimicrobial pipeline, is causing a need to revise this approach. TDM of antimicrobials, even for those with a wide therapeutic index, is becoming more common [5, 6], whilst TDM for the \u201ctraditional\u201d drugs, such as aminoglycosides and glycopeptides, is continually being studied for further improvement.",

            "text": "Endothelial dysfunction is common in critical illness and is characterised by expansion of the interstitial space through \u201ccapillary leakage\u201d. This is closely linked to the severity of the underlying disease process and the degree of systemic inflammation. Sepsis and major burn injury are classic examples. This is then further exacerbated by intravenous (IV) fluid loading, a near-ubiquitous intervention in the ICU. For hydrophilic antimicrobials (e.g. acyclovir, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, daptomycin, fluconazole and glycopeptides), this can result in a significantly expanded Vd [7]. Changes in protein binding associated with hypoalbuminaemia will also potentially influence antimicrobial PK [8]. Indeed, hypoalbuminaemia is commonly encountered (as a negative acute phase reactant), resulting in an increase in the Vd for highly protein-bound antimicrobials, such as ceftriaxone, daptomycin, ertapenem, flucloxacillin and teicoplanin [8]. In these scenarios, the free (or unbound) fraction is increased, resulting in both greater distribution and potentially CL. Finally, extremes of body size and composition (typically obesity) will also influence Vd, although the magnitude of any such change will depend on the physicochemical properties of the antimicrobial (e.g. molecular weight, lipid solubility and degree of ionisation) [9].",

            "text": "Many commonly prescribed antimicrobials are principally cleared by renal elimination. In this context, critical illness can have a profound impact on renal function and therefore drug CL. Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is being increasingly noted in critically ill sub-populations (incidence of 14\u201380%) [10]. ARC is defined as an increased creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min/1.73 m2 measured by 8\u201324-h urine collection and refers to the enhanced renal elimination of circulating solute (such as metabolic waste and drugs) [11]. The underlying mechanisms are uncertain, although increased solute delivery related to a hyperdynamic high cardiac output state, in combination with tubular and/or neuroendocrine changes, is likely implicated [10]. Identifying patients with ARC is challenging as these patients may have elevated renal function despite normal serum creatinine concentrations [12], and importantly, commonly used glomerular filtration rate mathematical estimates, such as the Cockcroft\u2013Gault and Modified Diet in Renal Disease equations, are unlikely to be reliable as compared to urinary creatinine clearance data [13]. Younger patients with multiple trauma are at the highest risk [12], but ARC has also been described in other patient categories. Moreover, the presence of ARC has been associated with sub-optimal plasma antimicrobial concentrations [11], although the implications in terms of clinical outcomes remain unclear [14].",

Factors such as molecular weight, protein binding, hydrophilicity, mode of RRT, filter porosity, surface area, blood flow rate and total effluent rate will all influence extracorporeal drug handling [15]. Given the heterogeneity in clinical practice and pathophysiology, antimicrobial dosing is generally empiric, resulting in substantial intra- and inter-patient variability in drug concentrations [16].

This relationship can be described by relating the PK exposure of an antimicrobial to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the offending pathogen. Antimicrobials classically have different PK/PD indices [19], and these can be categorised as: (a) the ratio of maximum drug concentration (Cmax) to MIC (Cmax/MIC); (b) the duration of time (T) that the free drug concentration remains above the MIC during a dosing interval (fT>MIC); and (c) the ratio of the area under the concentration\u2013time curve during a 24-hour period to MIC (AUC0\u201324/MIC) [20]. However, it is also important to note that individual MICs were rarely measured in most of the earlier studies and parameters such as MIC50 and MIC90 were used instead to describe the PK/PD relationships. For antivirals, in particular, measures other than the MIC have been used as the denominator of the PK/PD index such as the in vitro concentration required to obtain 50% of the maximum effect (EC50). The denominator in these indices is an important consideration because when it increases, the corresponding PK exposure should also be increased to ensure that the optimal PK/PD index is still achieved. This is mostly relevant in the ICU as at least bacterial pathogens may demonstrate higher MICs, as much as 2\u20134 times higher, when compared to the general wards [21].",

            "text": "Importantly, a recent review by Mouton et al. highlights that the use of an individual MIC to guide antibacterial dosing may not be appropriate due to imprecise and highly variable (varying by 1\u20132 dilutions in both directions) measurements associated with MIC determination [22]. Therefore, an individual MIC measurement should only be regarded as an estimate and not a \u201ctrue\u201d value of a pathogen\u2019s susceptibility. MIC may vary according to determination methods (e.g. broth microdilution vs. E-test\u00ae), and it is therefore important to aim for an appropriate MIC method-specific target, with broth microdilution (BMD) MIC being the preferred method, if they are available. Any potential dosing adjustments with the aid of TDM must consider MIC variation and should be interpreted in the context of assay variation, species identification and wild-type distributions. Measures of MIC distributions such as epidemiologic cut-off (ECOFF) values, which separate bacterial populations into those of a wild-type population and those with either a low- or high-level phenotypically detectable resistance, can be more useful to guide antibacterial dosing. Mouton et al. proposed several practical solutions in their review to optimise antibacterial dosing for patients, and one of the important recommendations included the use of ECOFF values as the PD target for dosing purposes when the measured MIC for the bacterial strain is within the wild-type distribution [22]. If the MIC is slightly above the ECOFF, a two-fold dilution of the MIC can be assumed for dosing purposes, whilst MIC-guided therapy should not be an option if the measured MIC is clearly far above the ECOFF and clinical resistance breakpoint.",

Whilst Cmin provides some information on drug CL, determination of Vd requires an additional sample earlier in the dosing interval. For the estimation of derived PK parameters, such as the AUC, and PK/PD targets, such as the fT>MIC, an optimised PK sampling schedule is suggested for unbiased and precise parameter estimation. A limited sampling strategy (LSS), which uses the most \u201cinformative\u201d concentration\u2013time points (commonly 1\u20133 sampling time points) to describe a drug\u2019s PK, is relatively easy to be performed and may provide accurate estimates of full drug exposure [23, 24]. The optimal sampling time points for a drug can be identified during \u201climited sampling\u201d studies where these time points will be estimated or calculated using PK models and Monte Carlo simulations. The time points can then be used to predict AUC0\u201324, and as such, this approach is beneficial for those antimicrobials in which AUC0\u201324/MIC ratios are the major determinants for efficacy. For example, although 10\u201315 time points are conventionally needed to calculate 80% of the total AUC, Alsultan et al. demonstrated that these can be reduced to only 2 time points (sampling at 4 and 6 h post-dose) with LSS to estimate levofloxacin AUC [25]. For antibacterials that are administered via continuous infusion, a sample at any given time during administration can be used.",

Whilst it is still popular to compare and evaluate a single drug concentration (e.g. Cmin) against a therapeutic target range, and this method is the easiest, it is the least accurate method for dosing adjustment. Dosing nomograms, on the other hand, can integrate PK/PD data with measures of organ function (e.g. renal function described using creatinine clearance) and have demonstrated to be superior to conventional antimicrobial dosing [29, 30]. However, separating the sources of PK variability and incorporating > 1 covariate for dosing adjustments (e.g. creatinine clearance and weight) are not possible with a single dosing nomogram. Additionally, the dose prediction from such nomograms would be inaccurate if the pre-defined PK sampling/dosing schedule is not strictly adhered to. The use of dosing software overcomes these limitations [2], and these methods have been shown to be superior over conventional antimicrobial dosing for vancomycin [31], particularly in the context of:the first dose can initially be individualised for patients by using Monte Carlo simulations;the sources of PK variability can be separated into intra- and inter-individual variability;PK sampling before reaching steady state is possible; andthrough Bayesian estimation, the entire antimicrobial PK profile can be estimated from a single PK sample. Bayesian estimation is most accurate when an optimal sampling time is chosen to provide the most information about the drug\u2019s PK behaviour in the patient and a suitable population PK model matching the target population to serve as the Bayesian prior model [32]. After initial TDM, it is recommended to repeat TDM (within 1\u20132 days for most drugs) to confirm therapeutic exposures have been achieved and again thereafter if there are concerns of significant changes to PK (e.g. enteral absorption, renal function).",

Although higher Cmin [220\u2013226] and AUC [225, 227, 228] values have been associated with eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or sustained virological response in some studies, it is important to note that numerous studies have also shown no association between these parameters and sustained virological response. It has been suggested that the AUC0\u20134 (1.76 mg h/L) and AUC0\u201312 (3.01 mg h/L) after the first dose may be a better sustained virological response predictor when compared to Cmin or any single time point [228]. Although haemolytic anaemia has been linked with a Cmin of > 2.3\u20133.5 [224, 229, 230], some studies have found no significant correlation. Additionally, other studies indicated that other factors (e.g. pegIFN-alpha-2a levels) may have a greater impact on the outcome than ribavirin concentrations [231].",

Furthermore, there is currently conflicting data regarding the relationship between ribavirin exposures with therapeutic or toxic effects. However, it is important to note that as opposed to weight-based dosing, TDM-guided ribavirin dosing has been shown to significantly improve sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 [227]. Although anaemia was more severe in the TDM group, it was well managed with erythropoietin beta. More recently, TDM has been suggested as a useful tool to guide ribavirin treatment in lung transplant recipients with paramyxovirus infection [232].",

As extreme pathophysiological changes are likely to affect antimicrobial exposures, factors associated with PK/PD alterations need to be determined and considered in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock. Optimal antimicrobial exposures and PK/PD targets for patient benefits need to be further elucidated before appropriate dosing regimens and strategies can be improved in this population. The role of biomarkers as a surrogate for an antimicrobial response should be investigated as an earlier therapeutic intervention can be made rather than relying on clinical signs and symptoms [234, 235].

An easy-to-use chromatography-based method that enables rapid and reliable simultaneous determination of antimicrobial concentrations in plasma and tissues can be developed, and some are now being used routinely in clinical settings. Although concentration measurements are usually performed in blood matrices (e.g. plasma or serum), several alternative sampling strategies (e.g. dried blood spots and volumetric absorptive microsamples), which are minimally or non-invasive approaches, need to be further investigated and validated for routine TDM in critically ill patients.

TDM-guided dosing is the only safe and effective way to ensure that all critically ill patients achieve therapeutic antimicrobial exposures. TDM-guided dosing has been shown to be clinically beneficial for aminoglycosides, voriconazole and ribavirin. For most common antibiotics and antifungals in the ICU, a clear therapeutic range has been established and for these agents, routine TDM in critically ill patients may be useful. Specifically, we recommend routine TDM when one of these antibiotics or antifungals is used in critically ill patients: aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics, linezolid, teicoplanin, vancomycin and voriconazole. For the antivirals, urgent research is needed to identify therapeutic targets for patient benefits and to also ascertain whether antiviral TDM is indeed meritorious in this patient population. Although we believe that TDM should be the standard of care for most antimicrobials in every ICU, important barriers, such as the availability of bioanalytical experts and TDM equipments in an institution, need to be addressed before routine TDM can be widely employed worldwide.",
