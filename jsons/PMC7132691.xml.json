            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was responsible for several well-documented nosocomial outbreaks in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. The infection control practices applied in these varied settings met with mixed success.1, 2, 3, 4 The associated morbidity and mortality in health care workers (HCWs) affected by SARS focused attention on the recommended infection control practices and personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing airborne and droplet-spread transmission of infectious agents. During the SARS outbreak, widely divergent opinions were voiced on the adequacy of these measures.5 Expert opinions varied on respirator selection and use, the need for fit-testing N95 respirators, and the need for protective eyewear. Clearly, there was a need to evaluate the adequacy of the infection control measures to ensure that HCWs are protected in future outbreaks, not only for SARS but also against a variety of new and emerging respiratory pathogens. The purpose of this paper is to review the findings of a literature search on the effectiveness of infection control practices aimed at preventing occupational-associated transmission of infectious respiratory agents in the health care setting.",

Literature searches were conducted in several databases for English-language articles published in the last 15 years that related to infection control practices, occupational health and safety issues, environmental factors, and other issues of importance in protecting workers against infections in health care settings. Databases used were as follows: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulated Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and OSHROM. This produced an initial list of 841 publications, using 80 keywords. From the initial literature search results, a series of research topics were developed under 3 broad categories: (1) basic science and efficacy of facial protective equipment, (2) the effectiveness of specific infection control procedures, and (3) organizational and individual factors that influence infection control and occupational health in health care settings.",

Both Seto et al,6 in a study on Hong Kong health care workers, and Loeb et al,7 in a study conducted in Toronto, found that not consistently wearing either a surgical mask or an N95 respirator was associated with developing SARS when compared with their consistent use. The Seto et al study found that only mask usage was significant in the multivariate analysis; however, there was no difference in risk of infection whether HCWs were using surgical masks or N95 respirators.2 It should be noted that, in this study, the one hospital in which the source of the outbreak was determined to be a patient who was receiving nebulizer therapy was excluded from this study because \u201cdroplet precautions have never been recognized as an effective infection control measure for such aerosol-generating procedures.\u201d The authors concluded that precautions against droplets (ie, use of a surgical mask) and contact precautions are adequate for prevention of nosocomial SARS when no aerosol-generating procedures are used. The situation is less clear when aerosols may be generated.",

Specifically, 3 of 23 nurses (13%) who consistently wore a surgical mask or an N95 respirator acquired SARS compared with 5 of 9 nurses (56%) who did not consistently wear either (P\n = .02). The relative risk for infection was 0.22 (P\n = .06) for nurses who always wore an N95 respirator when compared with nurses who did not wear any item consistently. The relative risk for infection was 0.45 (P\n = .56) for nurses who always wore a surgical mask when compared with nurses who did not wear any item consistently, implying no statistically significant difference between wearing a surgical mask and not wearing a mask at all. However, the difference in relative risk for SARS infection for nurses who consistently wore N95 respirators compared with those who consistently wore surgical masks was also not statistically significant (P\n = .5). The study is one of the most informative coming from the SARS outbreak itself but suffers from many limitations. Unfortunately, the small sample size of the cohort and other confounding factors made interpretation of the results difficult. The role of fit testing was not addressed, and the potential for accidental autoinoculation when removing gear was not examined. The suggestion by the authors that consistent use of even a surgical mask was sufficient protection is supported from descriptions of SARS control measures in Vietnam. Ha et al4 reported that, in one hospital in which workers were exposed to confirmed SARS patients, none of the workers subsequently developed SARS, despite the fact that N95 respirators were not available until the third week of the outbreak. Despite this lack of respirators, initial control measures were successful in limiting spread.4\n",

In addition, HCWs who perceived that the amount of personal protective equipment available was inadequate were at higher risk for developing SARS, and this effect remained significant in the multivariate model.2 Because the study was conducted in 5 hospitals in Hong Kong, the researchers were unable to confirm what specific items (if any) were inadequately supplied. They noted, however, that, given the large differences in risk for SARS infection (odds ratio >5; P < .001), it was likely that actual rather than perceived PPE shortages were at least partially responsible.",

Studies of their use in clinical practice have shown that a range of between 44% and 97% of HCWs use the respirators properly.8 Thus, it is feasible that the improved efficacy of an N95 respirator over a surgical mask may be easily lost if compliance is poor or inadequate training is provided. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasizes the importance of formal respiratory protection programs as well as ensuring that workers understand the correct order in which to remove PPE.9 Park et al retrospectively reviewed HCWs who had been exposed to those American patients with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection and supports the observations of others with regard to compliance with infection control guidelines.10 Sixty-six HCWs reported exposure to patients who were coughing and later found to be SARS positive, yet 40% did not use a respirator. Despite being exposed and developing symptoms, 10 of 17 HCWs were not furloughed. However, none of the HCWs developed SARS, and no local disease transmission occurred.",

The relative importance of fit testing versus education on how to perform a proper fit check is unclear, and, in fact, fit checking may be the most valuable skill of the 2 in reducing exposures to infectious aerosols. Hannum et al examined the effect of 3 different methods of respirator training on the ability of health care workers to pass a qualitative fit test.12 Group A, which received one-on-one training and fit testing, did not significantly differ from the group that received a classroom demonstration by infection control nurses in the proper use of respirators without fit testing. The authors concluded that fit testing as a part of training marginally enhanced the ability of HCWs to pass a fit test. The limited studies, demonstrating the importance of fit checking each and every time to ensure a good seal, suggests that regular fit testing is less important than on-going assessment of the ability of health care workers to achieve an effective seal through fit checking.",

Risk decreased sequentially with exposures less than 3 meters from a case or greater than 3 meters and whether they took place with or without cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures.14 This implies that physical separation of SARS patients from other patients and staff members should have some effect on preventing transmission of SARS.

            "text": "The practice of infection control differs from the approach of industrial worker protection in that, historically, infection control approached the protection of HCWs primarily by applying barriers to those individuals who might potentially be exposed. This is in contrast to industry, whose occupational health approach is first to apply environmental and engineering controls to control hazardous materials from the source. This difference in approach was reflected in the review of the literature of which there was relatively little information concerning control of infectious exposures at the source. The recently published studies on the hospital-associated outbreaks of SARS have all concluded that direct contact or close exposure to a SARS patient is generally required to transmit the virus, although important exceptions exist.5, 13, 14, 15, 16 In some circumstances, aerosol-generating procedures have resulted in spread beyond that which is expected by droplet transmission of less than 3 feet. These episodes suggest that traditional concepts of droplet versus airborne transmission require reexamination. For example, some procedures, such as intubation, the use of continuous positive-pressure (CPAP) ventilation, or nebulizer therapy seemed to result in the generation of finer infectious droplets from SARS patients that could travel farther than those generated spontaneously through coughing. An analysis of a large outbreak in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong concluded that the aerosolization of SARS from fecal material by flushing toilets allowed spread of disease through the building's ventilation system because of improper seals around floor drains.17 This again resulted in transmission that ranged farther than could be explained by respiratory droplets. Such aerosol generation seems to be responsible for some episodes of spread at distances greater than those commonly found with large droplets and some instances of failure of infection control practices to prevent transmission.5, 9\n",

However, these topics require further investigation, and more research is needed on the generation and behaviour of respiratory particles during aerosolizing events such as nebulizer therapy and continuous positive airway pressure.",

Some HCWs contracted SARS while working with what should have been adequate PPE during aerosol-generating procedures. It will be important to study whether the failures to protect HCWs in these circumstances were due to failure in efficacy of controls or in the effectiveness in their use. Failures in efficacy would imply that better PPE (ie, N95 respirators) may be needed to protect adequately the HCWs from SARS in these circumstances. However, failure in effectiveness in the use of PPE would imply that less complicated infection control guidelines that focus on the key protective factors, combined with enhanced compliance, may ultimately be more successful in reducing infections. Additional studies to assess the relative importance of fit testing versus fit checking are required, particularly because the former has significant resource implications. Finally, the importance of the transocular route in disease transmission and how existing eye protection reduces this risk to HCWs are not understood.",
