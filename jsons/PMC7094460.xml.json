We categorized these patients as not having bacterial meningitis if they were well at the time of telephone follow-up. Cultures with growth of multiple bacteria or those not commonly considered pathogens (eg, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, diphtheroids, Bacillus species, viridans streptococci) were categorized as contaminants and considered negative for the analysis of SBI.

We suggest that clinicians need to exercise caution, especially in the first month of life, regarding comprehensiveness of evaluation including performance of lumbar punctures, regardless of virus infection status. For both age groups, at a minimum, an evaluation for UTI by collecting samples for urinalysis and urine culture should be strongly considered regardless of viral status. Finally, our study suggests the importance of incorporating the results of viral testing to provide better risk estimates of SBI in these infants and assist the clinician with decisions regarding lumbar puncture, empirical antibiotic treatment, and hospitalization. Formal decision analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses using these data will help to develop recommendations regarding viral testing and its impact as a part of the evaluation and management of these young febrile infants.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the parent study cohort consisted of a convenience sample of febrile infants and viral testing was performed at the discretion of the treating clinician during a time in which rapid testing was evolving. Furthermore, the number of viruses detectable and type of tests performed varied between sites (1) by season, (2) by type of test, namely, polymerase chain reaction vs other, (3) whether single viral tests or multiplex viral polymerase chain reaction panel tests were performed, (4) by type of specimen (nasal swab vs throat swab), and (5) by what tissue or fluid was sampled (CSF vs blood vs respiratory secretions). It is possible that the rates of SBI and the prevalence of viral infections detected would be different if comprehensive viral testing was performed on all patients or if higher sensitivity and specificity viral testing was used. Therefore, we cannot comment on the exact prevalence of viral infections in our study cohort. However, if higher, some of the current virus-negative patients with SBIs may have been virus positive with SBIs, and could have increased the rate of coinfection, thus, strengthening our conclusions. In addition, it is possible that the risk of SBI may vary with the type of viral infection and with the number of viral coinfections.20 Despite these limitations, the rate of SBI in the enrolled population was remarkably similar to that described in previous studies.28, 29 Second, we intentionally excluded febrile infants with obvious sources of bacterial infections (such as cellulitis) and critically ill-appearing infants because those infants represent a less significant diagnostic and therapeutic conundrum. The purpose of our study was to identify the risk of SBI in noncritically ill-appearing febrile infants who have confirmed viral infections to aid clinician decision making. Third, the analysis in which we stratified by type of viral infection did not have sufficient power to detect statistically significant differences in the risk of SBI by virus type; nevertheless, the results are hypothesis generating. Despite the substantial size and multicenter design of the study, we also did not have sufficient statistical power to comment on the risk difference in bacterial meningitis between virus-positive and virus-negative infants. Therefore, we suggest that clinicians retain low thresholds for performing lumbar punctures in young febrile infants with documented viral infections, especially those younger than 1 month of age. In addition, most of the EDs in PECARN are large, tertiary care, academic institutions and practice patterns including testing for viral pathogens as well as evaluation for SBI may not be representative of practice patterns in community EDs or primary care pediatric offices.27 Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed an updated definition of UTI that requires the presence of an abnormal urinalysis and a positive urine culture defined as at least 50 000 cfu/mL of a pathogenic bacterium.30 We did not use this definition in our study cohort because these guidelines apply to infants older than 2 months of age.",

Nevertheless, the risk of SBI was non-negligible in virus-positive infants, particularly UTIs, and approximately 1% of infants with documented virus infections in the first month of life had bacteremia and/or bacterial meningitis. Therefore, we concluded that the presence of a documented viral illness should not affect the initial (ED) evaluation for SBI in febrile infants 28 days of age and younger.
