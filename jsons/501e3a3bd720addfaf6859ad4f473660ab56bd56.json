Bronchioles are divided into two groups: the larger (average 0.5 to 1 mm diameter) membranous bronchioles branch from the smallest bronchi and give rise to the smaller (average 0.15 to 0.2mm diameter) respiratory bronchioles. The final smallest division of the membranous bronchioles that branches into the first tier of respiratory bronchioles is often called the terminal bronchiole. The membranous bronchioles only conduct air similar to bronchi, whereas the respiratory bronchioles both conduct air and participate in gas exchange via the alveoli in their walls. The respiratory bronchioles branch into about two more generations of respiratory bronchioles with increasing numbers of alveoli in their walls and give rise to the alveolar ducts. 1.2 Terminal bronchioles are the most distal generation of bronchioles that do not contain alveoli. All membranous bronchioles have a simple columnar epithelium (bronchiolar mucosa) composed of ciliated columnar cells and nonciliated Clara cells, a layer of smooth muscle, and a connective tissue adventitia. Membranous bronchioles lack cartilage, and seromucinous glands and goblet cells are generally not observed or are minimal in the normal bronchiolar mucosa. The terminal membranous bronchiole leads into the acinus (a functional unit composed of the structures distal to a single terminal bronchiole-its respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli). A lobule is an anatomic unit consisting of the acini of three to 10 membranous bronchioles that are bounded together by the interlobular septa. As with 886 the bronchi, the bronchioles are accompanied by branches of the pulmonary artery of approximately the same diameter. 1 ,2", "cite_spans": [{"start": 857, "end": 860, "text": "1.2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathology of Small Airways Philip T.

The alveoli budding from the bronchiolar walls increase in number the higher the generation of the respiratory bronchiole. In twodimensional longitudinal sections on glass slides, respiratory bronchioles often appear to have a bronchiolar mucosa and wall on one side of their lumen and alveolar spaces on the opposite side of their lumen. Respiratory bronchioles represent the first generation of airways in which exchange of gases occurs. 1.2 The histopathology of small airways may primarily involve the bronchioles alone or may be a component of a pulmonary disease characterized by other histopathologic changes. 3 -22 Focal small airways histopathology may be observed as a result of a localized acute injury such as a focal infection or bronchopneumonia. Further discussion of small airway injury as it relates to diseases and conditions involving the lungs can be found in other chapters, as follows: infections,23-35 Chapters 8 through 14; acute lung injury,6,7,9,10,22 Chapter 4; bronchial obstruction, including aspiration and asthma, 36 Several general histopathologic patterns are common to small airway injury regardless of etiology. Inflammation and fibrosis may involve the bronchiolar lumen, mucosa or wall, or the adjacent (peribronchiolar) tiers of alveolar septa. The bronchiolar epithelium or epithelium of peribronchiolar alveoli may also undergo metaplastic changes in association with inflammation and fibrosis, primarily with scarring as in constrictive bronchiolitis ( Fig. 25.1 ).104 These findings may be seen with both focal and diffuse airways injury. The basic patterns of small airway histopathology are listed in Table 25 .2. The types of metaplastic epithelium are listed in Table 25.3. Inflammation or scarring in bronchiolar walls or peribronchiolar tissue may result in decreased airflow that can often be measured physiologically as an obstructive change in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and more specifically in forced expiratory flow after 25% to 75% of vital capacity has been expelled (FEF2s-7s) or forced expiratory flow after 75% of vital capacity has been expelled (FEF7s), However, small airways histopathologic changes may be associated with restrictive changes instead of or in addition to obstructive changes. The frequency with which bronchiolitis causes clinical symptoms is fairly uncommon compared to the frequency with which pathologists may encounter histopathologic lesions because of the large total cross-sectional area of the bronchioles. On the other hand, clinical symptoms may be severe despite what appears to be relatively mild small airway histopathology.los-l07 Bronchiolitis is recognized at low power as an inflammation or fibrosis that is centered in and around the bronchioles. In many cases of bronchiolitis, inflammatory infiltrates precede airway scarring, but this is not always the case and some lesions consist primarily or totally of scarring from the beginning of their course. Fibroblastic granulation tissue may precede mature scars. Findings of bronchiolitis may be nonspecific and it may be difficult to ascertain the underlying cause of either inflamed or scarred bronchioles. Additional nonspecific findings such as intra alveolar foamy macrophages due to small airway obstruction may be present, regardless of the etiology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 582, "end": 585, "text": "1.2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1189, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1636, "end": 1645, "text": "Fig. 25.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1795, "text": "Table 25", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1861, "text": "Table 25.3.", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Pathology of Small Airways Philip T.
