            "text": "A healthy gut can help birds to gain optimum growth performance because gastrointestinal tract (GI) is meant for digestion/absorption of nutrients and immune response. The mucosal membrane of the intestine serves as a barrier between luminal digesta and tissues and requires a dynamic balance between different components of gut like epithelial cells, microbiome, and immune system cells for proper functioning. One of the most important components that affect intestinal mucosal barrier is microbiota because gut health is mediated by commensal microbes influencing the development of structure and morphology of gut (Kamada et al., 2013). Microbiome of the intestine is responsible for biosynthesis of different vital nutrients for the host including vitamins especially B vitamins (Hooper et al., 2002; Leblanc et al., 2013) and some essential amino acids. Moreover, they are also responsible for the production of different metabolites from undigested dietary components in the small intestine (B\u00e4ckhed et al., 2005). Microbiota produces butyrate, propionate, and acetate, which provide epithelial cells with energy and also influence mucosal barrier (Topping and Clifton 2001). The beneficial microbiota effectively supports host in the regulation of homeostasis, immune response, organ development and metabolic processes (B\u00e4ckhed, 2013).",

            "text": "The intestinal microbiota has exhibited its unique effects on the development of both innate and acquired mucosal immunity (Gaskins, 1997). Therefore, the second most important functional role of the gut after nutrient absorption is pathogen defense. The gut components that mediate host immune system include an intestinal mucosal layer, epithelial cells, and immunoglobulin A, and antimicrobial peptides. The microbiota is responsible for enhancing intestinal immunity through mediation of toll-like receptor (TLR) expression (Lundin et al., 2008), antigenic response, and lymph follicles (Lee and Mazmanian, 2010; Belkaid and Hand, 2014), as well as by affecting systemic immunity (Noverr and Huffnagle, 2004). The most significant component of intestinal immunity includes a protective covering of mucus gel that contains mucin glycoproteins synthesized and secreted by goblet cells in gut epithelium (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004; Dharmani et al., 2009; Forder et al., 2012). This mucin layer promotes the passage rate of digesta and serves as a protective covering against injuries caused by feed, microbes, and their products. This specialized mucin protective covering has two layers in which outer loose layer allows microbial colonization, while inner compact layer inhibits attachment of bacteria acting as first line of defense against pathogenic infection (Brisbin et al., 2008; Johansson et al., 2010). The changes in normal intestinal microbiota have been associated with modification of goblets cells ultimately changing the composition of intestinal mucus. Such mediations in microbial populations and/or host-derived inflammatory mediators are coupled with alteration of expression of mucin thus directly affecting composition or secretion of mucus. Comparison of conventionally reared broiler and germ-free broiler chicks revealed differential mucin profile and increased goblet cells in the intestine (Forder et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Gut microbiome not only modulates antibody-mediated response but also greatly influences cell-mediated immune components. Studies have reported significant effects of complexity of intestinal microbiome on gut T cell repertoire in chicken (Mwangi et al., 2010). For example, Lactobacillus species have exhibited their ability to induce differential cytokine expression in T cells of chicken cecal tonsils that could contribute to intestinal homeostasis (Brisbin et al., 2012). Additionally, a significant decrease in expression of important cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) has been observed in the response of treatment with a blend of probiotic bacteria (L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, and S. faecalis) in Salmonella typhimurium challenged broiler chicken (Haghighi et al., 2008). It is evident from different studies that commensal bacteria of the intestine (at least some of them) significantly affect the immune system of the bird along with pathogenic and probiotic strains. The predominant bacterial species in the gut mainly include: lactic acid bacteria (55%), rods (44%), and pathogens (\u223c1%). The relative abundance of the microbial community in the gut is affected by many factors that predominantly include feed, age, use of feed additives, and pathogenic infection. Such changes in gut microflora can potentially modulate performance of host by affecting growth rate, immune status, and maturity (Apajalahti and Vienola, 2016). Keeping in view the importance of intestinal microbiome, it seems plausible to evaluate different additives that can affect colonization of intestinal microbiota to improve immune response in chicken. Green tea has shown its potential in improving the antioxidant status and immune function in animals. Polyphenols and amino acids (L-theanine) in green tea have been suggested to have the potential to modulate the immune system and intestinal microflora. Moreover, numerous studies on the administration of green tea (L-theanine) in calves and pigs have exhibited improvement in intestinal microflora balance demonstrated by increased fecal Lactobacillus and decreased Clostridia (Hara et al., 1995; Ishihara et al., 2001). In our previous study, growth performance data of birds revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine at a dose rate of 200 mg/kg showed better results in terms of weight gain, meat quality, immune response, and feed conversion ratio (FCR; Saeed et al., 2018). It was hypothesized that improved performance of birds may be a result of modulation of intestinal immunity and microbiome that led to better gut health.",

The total rearing period of 6 wk was sub-divided into two phases: a starter phase (1 to 3 wk) and finisher phase (3 to 6 wk). L-theanine was purchased from a commercial company (Jiangsu Qiang Sheng Chemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China with 98% purity) and was mixed in feed mill with different concentrations at 0, 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed for the C, 100 LT, 200 LT, and 300 LT treatments groups, respectively. This addition did not change the pH value of diets. Basal diets were formulated according to NRC recommendations and were iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous (NRC, Rockville, MD, 1994) as shown in Table 1. Chicks were housed in a room having 20 pens of uniform size (3 \u00d7 4 sq feet). Pens were whitewashed and disinfected with bromogeramine (1%) before the start of the experiment. For each pen, wood shaving (layer of 3 inches) was used as litter. Ambient temperature was set at 32\u00b0C at placement and then decreased gradually to achieve 24\u00b0C from week 3 onwards. Lighting was constant on the first day and then changed from day 2 to the end of the study trial to a regime 21 L:3D. Chicks were vaccinated against infectious bursal disease at the age of 8th, 18th, and 28th day while for Newcastle disease at the age of 5th and 18th days (MAFF, 1984). At 21st and 42nd day of rearing, five birds were randomly selected from each treatment group and humanely euthanized. Mucosal contents were aseptically collected from each bird and immediately stored at \u201320\u00b0C and promptly processed. Birds were fasted for 16 h before slaughter. Mucosal samples were scrapped aseptically from ileum (2 cm from Merkel's diverticulum) and jejunum by sterile glass slides.

            "text": "Adaptive immunity in birds is significantly affected by immuno-regulatory peptides called cytokines. For example, interleukin-12 is responsible for differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into Th-1 cells, which is required for mediation of immune response to enable the host to resist pathogenic invasion (Park et al., 2008). Similarly, another cytokine IFN-\u03b3 activates lymphocytes and enhances expression of MHC class II antigens leading to regulation of acquired immunity. Additionally, a high level of IFN-\u03b3 has been observed during an immunogenic response against coccidia infection in chicken and is considered a marker of cellular immunity (Lee et al., 2008). Expression of mRNA expression of TLRs and cytokines was determined in the intestine to reveal the influence of L-theanine on the intestinal immune response. Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2, TLR-4), TNF-\u03b1, IFN- \u03b3, and IL-2 was decreased as result of treatment with L-theanine as compared to control group (Figure 7). As L-theanine also increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum in this study, so correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the relationship of the relative abundance of Lactobacillus with mRNA expression of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 8). It was observed that the increase in abundance of Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 expression in intestine and these effects were highly significant (P < 0.01).",

Relative abundance of different bacterial species is also very divergent across different sections of the GT as a preference for species colonization widely varies among bacterial taxa. Results of the relative abundance of intestinal microflora observed in this study are consistent with earlier researches that reported that predominant phylum of bacteria in the chicken gut is Firmicutes. Their abundance ranges from 50% to 90% of total bacterial population in the ceca (Qu et al., 2008; Danzeisen et al., 2011), while Firmicutes (mainly Lactobacilli) generally form more than 90% of all taxa in other segments of gut like ileum and jejunum (Gong et al., 2007; Rehman et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2008; Danzeisen et al., 2011). A large variation has been observed in microbiota composition between individual broiler chickens. These differences occur even in animals managed under the same dietary and environmental conditions (Stanley et al., 2016). Conditions such as stress, immunological development, and epigenetic factors may be involved, which results in high inter-individual diversity in intestinal microbiota composition. Effect of L-theanine in increasing abundance of Firmicutes is significant in both ileum and jejunum mucosa and exhibits its potential for modulation of the gut microbiome in broilers. Recently, a study (Shaufi et al., 2015) also reported Firmicutes as most abundant bacterial phylum (>70% of all bacterial sequences) in the ileum of chicken at all ages. They also reported that Firmicutes was also abundant phylum (48%) in caeca of chicken at 42 d of age, which has also been reported previously (Wei et al., 2013). However, a variable abundance of bacteria in fecal samples was observed by Singh et al. (2012) as Proteobacteria was abundant phylum followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria.",

            "text": "The fact that lactobacilli are the dominant and diverse bacteria in the crop, ileum, duodenum, and jejunum has been widely reported in culture-dependent (Fuller, 1997) and independent studies (Guan et al., 2003). Lactobacilli are commonly considered as a sign of healthy gut (Snel et al., 1995) being relatively more abundant in the chicken ileum (Lu et al., 2003). A flow of digesta is more rapid in the proximal part of the intestine (duodenum), which ultimately results in reduced numbers of bacterial harboring on average 103 to 105 cells g\u22121 of digesta. However, distal small intestine (ileum) harbors a greater number of bacteria (108 to 109 cells g \u22121 digesta) and possesses a highly diverse bacterial population. Many factors could contribute to a variable composition of intestinal microbes, among which significant factors include the type of feed, species, variable rearing and environmental conditions, and different techniques used for analysis. There are various possible modes of action like competitive exclusion and adjustment of the microbial population like Lactobacillus in intestinal microflora (Fang et al., 2000; Frece et al., 2009). The microbial diversity and structures of community of gut microbial population are reported to be significantly affected by dietary ingredients (Knarreborg et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2003) bird's age (Lu et al., 2003; Zhu and Joerger, 2003; Amit-Romach et al., 2004) and administration of drugs like antibiotics (Knarreborg et al., 2002; Smirnov et al., 2005). Modulation of intestinal microbiome by L-theanine as revealed by this study provides strong evidence of its influence on body weight gain and immunity of broilers. Dietary supplementation of L-theanine increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus (>90%) that ultimately made the gut environment conducive for efficient nutrient absorption, metabolism, and better intestinal immunity. L-theanine is a unique amino acid that is only found in tea naturally and is responsible for many physiological roles of green tea (Juneja et al., 1999). The precise mechanism that how L-theanine manipulated gut microbiota is not clear but these potential effects are beneficial for chicken as a healthy gut is responsible for proper nutrient absorption, utilization, and immune response. L-theanine enhanced expression of occludin and ZO-1 that are normally required for formation of TJ proteins, which are the first line of defense against a pathogenic attack on intestinal epithelium. Both innate and adaptive immunity are critically affected by super family of tumor necrosis factors that modulate inflammatory process, apoptosis, and proliferation of cells (Kaiser and St\u00e4heli, 2008). Supplementation of directly fed microbes containing Bacillus has been reported to modulate expression of immune-related cytokines leading to improved immune response. Decrease in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) has also been reported in the intestine of chicken fed on probiotic (L. casei, L. acidophilus, B. thermophilum, and E. faecium) supplemented diet for 21 d (Chichlowski et al., 2007). Similarly, treatment with L. fermentum reduced the TLR2 level, without affecting TLR4. Various studies have reported mediation of immune functions in response to supplementation of diet with Lactobacilli (Lopez et al., 2008; Llopis et al., 2009). These results imply that beneficial microbiota containing Lactobacilli can regulate intestinal immunity and modulate cytokines and TLR levels to ameliorate inflammation (Cao et al., 2013).",

            "text": "L-theanine modulates immunity and growth response by exerting two-fold effects; one by favoring beneficial gut microbiota by increasing their relative abundance that reduces pathogenic load by competitive exclusion. At the same time, L-theanine directly reduces the expression of mRNA of TLRs (TLR-2, TLR-4), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-2) as observed in this study. Earlier reports have also demonstrated this ability of L-theanine to inhibit stress-induced inflammatory response by decreasing serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in mice (Jiang et al., 2012). Moreover, it was also observed that L-theanine is potentially responsible for down-regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) along with improving the anti-oxidant ability of cells affected by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity. Theanine is not an anti-oxidant but enhances the activity of anti-oxidant enzyme activities and increases the concentration of glutathione (GSH). Many studies have shown favorable role of L-theanine on immune system as revealed by epidemiological studies and experiments on cell cultures, animals and humans (Kim et al., 2008; Chattopadhyay et al., 2011; D\u2019Arena et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2014; Huijun wang et al., 2014). After oral intake of L-theanine, it is absorbed in blood through the gut and hydrolyzes in glutamic acid and ethylamine in liver and intestine (Tsuge et al., 2003; Scheid et al., 2012). This ethylamine is capable of the proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes that are subsets of T-cells and act as the first line of defense in case of pathogenic attack as reported in a clinical study (Rowe et al., 2007). So these potential effects of L-theanine by enhancing proliferation of T lymphocytes while decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory response mediate immune response effectively. Results revealed that L-theanine-mediated growth and immune response in broiler by modulation of intestinal microbiome that ultimately influences better nutrient utilization and metabolism along with positively influencing intestinal immunity. This mediation of intestinal microbiome was also coupled with the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in gut and regulation of expression of inflammatory cytokines and TLRs in the intestine that provided two-fold responses in terms of growth and immune response. However, further studies are required to explore the mechanism of modulation of intestinal microbiota and T lymphocyte-mediated immune response in chicken by L-theanine. The graphical presentation of our major findings of the study is illustrating in Figure 9.",

L-theanine showed its potential to modulate intestinal mucosal immune response and ameliorate inflammation by changing expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TLRs. Supplementation of dietary L-theanine improved the integrity of the TJ barrier by enhancing expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-3 in the intestine. Moreover, L-theanine showed its ability to modulate intestinal immunity and inflammatory response by regulating the expression of cytokines and TLRs. However, further studies are required to explore the mechanism of modulation of intestinal microbiota and T lymphocyte-mediated immune response in chicken by L-theanine.",
