The cancer-style pandemic is genetically inherited by nearly every character, hence, the human fate, in Full Sea. Albeit not a Sontag-esque pathological metaphor, China continues to crystallize ideological interpellation and hegemonic oppression in McHugh's work. 1 The extreme effects of utopia and dystopia, sinophilia and sinophobia in particular, are the interlocked head and tail of the sci-fi uroboros.

Reverse colonization materializes in the socialist McHugh's Zhang less as a takeover than as a makeover, a benign growth on the body of America, normalized, even hailed, as a technological utopia. McHugh's China-dominated future is a mere screen for, in the words of Fredric Jameson, the \"unmediated, unfiltered experience of the daily life of capitalism,\" not so much \"unmediated, unfiltered experience\" as a critique thereof in the vein of a Marxist utopian impulse (Archaeologies of the Future 287).",

(3) (4) Moving into \"the late 20th century,\" argues Gregory Claeys in Searching for Utopia (2011) , \"the spectre of ecological catastrophe came increasingly to displace totalitarianism as the dystopia of choice\" (202). Indeed, McHugh's Marxist heaven is replaced with total environmental devastation by Chang-rae Lee. The benign growth is now indisputably malignant. Lee's bleak dystopia manifests the doomsday scenario presaged by the ecocriticism from Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962 up to Priscilla Wald in 2015, whose description sounds like an uncanny footnote to Full Sea, or full of C-illness: \"Permeating the fundamental substance of humanity-blood, bones, sinew-the chemicals are colonizing the future, seeping into genes and \u2026 the circulatory systems of people and of the planet\" (183).

            "text": "Despite the shared trope of \"Good China, Bad China,\" McHugh and Lee are two very different writers, not to mention the intervening shadows of September 11, war on terror, global economic downturn, and, of course, the ascent of China that enshroud Lee's vision. 2 McHugh is a practitioner of science fiction, following her debut Zhang with three more novels in the same vein. Asianness as a theme does diminish dramatically after her debut. Reflecting techno-Orientalism's turn from the 1980s Japan fad to the 1990s China fad, McHugh launched her career with a heavy dose of Chineseness, but has evolved away from it. Christopher T. Fan posits that two autobiographical crises of McHugh's life brought about Zhang: McHugh's working experiences as \"a precarious laborer in New York City during the 1980s\"; and her witnessing of China's \"radical reorientation from Maoist to market-directed aims\" in 1987-1988 when she taught English in Shijiazhuang, China (\"Techno-Orientalism with Chinese Characteristics\" 2). In other words, McHugh learned firsthand how laborers fell through the cracks in the financial capital of capitalism and how a communist China gave way to a market economy in a city two hundred miles from the PRC's capital. Yet, like fellow mainstream sci-fi writers, including cyberpunks and techno-Orientalists, such as William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) based on Philip K. Dick's novel, Asianness is a narrative strategy they resort to as well as put behind then. Asianness is the mask of the Other that white writers, in their complacency of mainstream universalism, elect to assume or take off at will.",

            "text": "Published after Zhang, McHugh's Half the Day Is Night (1994, henceforth Half) is futuristic, post-holocaustal, but decidedly not postrace. Rather than moving beyond the social and historical construct of race, race turns out to be even more entrenched in the future. As such, sci-fi dramatizes the racial differences and inequality of the here and now. Consequently, Half features race-based characters, with bloodline in a symbolic sense dominating the characters' physiognomy: one is blond and the other with \"a broad Mayan face and hook nose; a face like the Olmec man\" (30-31). The protagonists are vague shadows of their Chinese and Oriental genes: the French-speaking Jean David Dai is a \"skinny little Asian\" with a limp, whose \"great-grandparents were from Vietnam\" (31, 16); Mayla Ling professes that \"My greats were Chinese. My grandfather is Chinese-American, but I'm a, I guess I'm a mongrel\" (16). John Ling, Mayla's stern grandfather in a wheelchair, strikes one as a stereotype of traditional moribund Chinese patriarchs straight out of Frank Chin's plays. 3 It is worth noting that their Asian ancestry is announced by the protagonists themselves, in addition to Dai's Asian physiognomy or in spite of Mayla's \"mongrel,\" un-Asian physiognomy. By contrast, the blond, Mayan-looking, and sundry other characters are merely described. Given that physical traits manifest the characters' origins, more agency seems to be bestowed on the \"Asiatics.\" But this remains an agency bestowed by McHugh, who kneads in \"now you see it now you don't\" Asian ethnicity according to her narrative needs.",

Whereas Zhang contains whole chapters on cybernetic kite flying and Arctic exploration, Half imagines construction under the sea. The level of understanding of material science and laborers' physical hardships is deep and astounding. Another stylistic characteristic of Zhang is also carried over to Half: multilingual hybridity. Jean David Dai is French Vietnamese, unfamiliar with English, a linguistic borderland akin to the American-born Zhang passing as Chinese. Now employed as Mayla's bodyguard in the Carib, which is largely Spanish-speaking, Half has integrated multiple languages from West and East. Mission Child (1998) doubles back to Zhang's theme of homosexuality, centering it on the cross-dressing, transgender protagonist Janna-Jan trying to survive genocides and atrocities in a Darwinian landscape of the future. Instructed by a Native American-style crossdressing shaman, the transgender protagonist winds up in Hainandao, the southernmost island of China that also provides part of the setting in Zhang.",

            "text": "In contrast to McHugh's sci-fi corpus, Chang-rae Lee is an American ethnic writer who has arrived at a dystopic Full Sea after four novels. Other than being influenced by the millennial sci-fi and China rage, pun intended, it seemed that Lee's own trajectory was overdetermined that he would have a go at a bad China, which crystallizes the \"bad blood\" that infects the world. The novelist's problematic relationship with Asianness as symptomatic of Asian American identity began with his debut novel, Native Speaker (1995) . In that breakthrough novel, Lee capitalizes on Korean American ethnicity, where the protagonist Henry Park is torn between his \"lengthy Anglican Goddess\" of a wife (15), his greengrocer immigrant father dying like a \"gritty mule\" (48), and his profession as a spy, winning the trust of his Asian subjects and then betraying them. Lee bundles together several genres (literary genes?): an ethnic bildungsroman favored by US multiculturalism; a romance and marriage on the rocks and slowly healing itself; a spy novel full of suspense and littered with film noir lingo. This generic hybridity reflects Henry Park's torturous split between assimilation and ethnic identity, apparently irreconcilable to the extent that the novel concludes with \"in every betrayal [of Asian subjects] dwells a self-betrayal [of Asianness]\" (314).",

The Korean adoptee and Japanese military doctor Doc Hata's brief encounter with comfort woman K haunts him into his old age, so much so that he overcompensates by adopting the mixed-race Korean Sunny, a K substitute, in a quiet American suburban neighborhood. Lee then ventures into the heart of a white protagonist, Jerry Battle, in Aloft (2004), whose late wife Daisy was Korean and drowned herself in the family pool for unknown reasons. The burden of betrayal weighs on Battle, albeit subconsciously, and he takes to the air in his beloved private airplane to escape the earth, his profession as a landscaper, and Daisy's watery grave. Even in the 2010 The Surrendered's multiple perspectives, Jerry Battle lives on in the white character Hector, whose entanglement with an opium-addicted missionary's wife Sylvie during the Korean War culminates in Lee's obsession with ravishment, either war trauma and bonding, or Freudian eros and thanatos-the oralprone lovemaking of the Parks, the trysts with K amid gang rapes at the comfort station, a repentant Daisy after inexplicable bouts of rage offering herself in the shower \"doggie-style\" (108), and Hector and Sylvie languishing in alcoholic or opiate highs. The Surrendered's pathological love and dependency inch them toward a shared death wish. Hector's ex-wife June is terminally ill with cancer, a Korean War refugee who arrived in the USA through a sham marriage with Hector. The long line of Korean (discomfort?) women from those in Native Speaker to K, Sunny, Daisy, and June are mysterious and incomprehensible, in contrast to the \"tangible corporeality\" of Henry Park's white wife, Jerry Battle's Hispanic partner Rita, and Hector's Sylvie and girlfriend Dora. There is yet another commonality among these Korean women-they are all immigrants, who, by definition, are unknowable aliens.",

Indeed, these English-language writers often identify themselves as non-English-speaking immigrants to legitimize their narratives.

The folk oral tradition, largely non-existent in print culture, is made to contest official colonial history. Ethnic and mainstream writers' immigrant license resembles the tactical fabrication of the subaltern, both coming into being as an Other alleged to be part and parcel of the Self-Spivak merging with the subaltern or Henry Park with his mulish father. Admittedly well-intentioned and progressive, such licensing is nonetheless the doppelganger to the conservative hegemony, including traditional male discourse imposing male fantasies onto females from an allegedly female perspective, or Orientalist discourse imposing the binarism of cannibals and noble savages onto the racial other from an allegedly native perspective.

No equivalent effort is made to approximate Zhang's plethora of Mandarin, Singaporean English, and other dialects, or Native Speaker's pidgin-spewing grocer father and Korean dollar store owner.

The novel takes place in the wake of the proletarian revolution that replaced bankrupt capitalism with socialism; the USA is now the \"Socialist Union of American States\" (6), a \"backward\" place where the ABC protagonist Zhang and others crave to travel to China as the most technologically advanced nation-the good China (17). Gravitating to this object of desire, Zhang's Chinese father and Hispanic mother \"paid to adjust [Zhang's] genetic make up \u2026 that I look like a slope-head like my father\" (2). Even the derogatory stereotype of Asian slope-heads (as opposed to Caucasian eggheads or potato heads, one presumes) becomes an ideal, allowing Zhang to pass as Chinese. Reversing the Chinese inferiority complex from a debilitating century of being a subcolony, McHugh imagines an alternative universe where China stands truly as the \"Middle Kingdom,\" with America in its periphery. McHugh hereby begins to deploy sci-fi's quintessential \"cognitive estrangement,\" which Darko Suvin expounds in Metamorphoses of Science Fiction (1979) . In America, even shocked exclamations and invocations are no longer \"Oh God!\" or \"Lord!\" but \"Lenin and Mao Zedong!\" Zhang's schools in Brooklyn taught Chinese and apparently a lot more, as Maoist-style political slogans and Marxist theory and history are on everyone's lips. In fact, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution repeated itself in the Great Cleansing Winds campaign, which demoted Zhang's boss Qian and swept him and his ugly daughter San-xiang to the frontier colony of New York. McHugh's conceit not only elevates China as the world power but grafts China's communist past and ideology onto a future America and, in fact, galaxy, as Martian settlers are featured in several chapters, where the bad China begins to rear its ugly head, most conspicuous in the cruel and unusual punishment of a \"capital offence\" for \"deviance,\" like Zhang's homosexuality (17). Zhang's University of Nanjing tutor and lover, Haitao, jumps to his death, fearing exposure and worse. China's ascendance owes as much to a superior ideology and political system as to filthy lucre, or qian (\u9322 money) in Mandarin which happens to be the surname of Zhang's boss.",

This pattern of good kids being devoured by stronger, more aggressive forces tragically reprises in San-xiang, who, after becoming more presentable, thanks to long-overdue medical procedures, is desirable enough to be date raped by a Caucasian Bobby on drugs. Admittedly, the rape itself is typical enough: San-xiang screams in protest, but is silenced by slaps that draw blood.

Good China is to be consumed by bad China, which includes a Caucasian rapist and a predator lurking in China's sphere of influence where top managerial positions belong to the Chinese. For a home-coming to the center of gravity, Qian sacrifices his daughter's looks and happiness. For racial passing, Zhang's parents remake him genetically in the image of Chineseness.

Both the ancient philosophy of Daoism and Zen master training come into play in Zhang's apprenticeship to a Korean architect, Woo Eubong, who steers him toward \"enlightenment.\" Woo accomplishes this by having Zhang repeat nearly nonsensical exercises of designing only doors, followed by floors, windows, and other parts in ways that invoke de factor Zen koan, \"public cases,\" or small pieces of a cosmic puzzle awaiting resolution named duenwu (\u9813\u609fsudden illumination). \"Don't plan the building, let the system do that,\" counsels Woo. \"You just let go, let your mind drift and do what it wants\" (218). Woo even quotes Dao De Jing, the Daoism Bible: \"The way that can be spoken is not the way,\" coming after, of course, the six-character italicized, Romanized original in an attempt at authenticity (220). McHugh's dalliance with Daoism is preceded within the sci-fi genre by Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle (1962) and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven (1971), 4 and soon followed by Le Guin's The Telling (2000) . 5 Zhang ultimately consummates his Daoist engineering training when he imagines a perfect house. Contrary to Zhang's ecstatic egolessness, McHugh's dialectics of good and bad China do not sprout from a vacuum, but from a formula within American pop culture: Orientalist stereotypes and exotic idolization with a touch of sinophobia and sinophilia. The polarization displaces the repulsion-cum-attraction of the Western mind, albeit in the name of the egolessness of McHugh's Pop Dao, one spiked with Zen \u00e0 la D. T. Suzuki's The Zen Doctrine of No-Mind (1949) . That Orientalist combination attracts not only erstwhile novelists but also contemporary critics, such as Eric S. Rabkin in the seminal academic journal PMLA who applauds McHugh's Daoist self-effacing within a system as \"nearly utopian \u2026 but in my view it is the future of criticism\" (458). The Dao is the way, according to Rabkin, for scholarly criticism.",

Note that both Park and Hata are indiscriminately categorized as immigrants, in keeping with the \"conceit\" throughout Lee's corpus that the ethnic, hyphenated identity of Korean-American is presented at the outset as the access to the immigrant condition. If a spectrum is established with Hata at one end as a naturalized immigrant American and Park at the other as a Korean-American, then Lee certainly belongs to the latter-see how adroitly he handles the English language, even Hata the non-native speaker carries on self-assured conversations with many a striking, mellifluous turn of phrase. Not to belabor the point, but this is one of countless examples of the game, the fallacy, of immigrant license that writers, publishers, critics, and readers play together to feel good, to be \"in the zone\" of multiculturalism and globalization, both predicated on transnational migration and diaspora. Many rehearse this pattern of an immigrant genesis. In his interview with Lee, David Naimon sets the stage by introducing Lee's \"tales of immigrants\" (\"A Conversation with Changrae Lee\" 121), which leads to the question of \"cultural dissonance of the immigrant experience.\" This allows Lee to generalize his works as \"put toward the lens of immigrancy\" (122): \"I kind of feel like I've been writing dystopian books all along. If you think of an immigrant coming to a place called New York City \u2026 it's an alien world, right?\" (123). Neither Naimon nor any other critic tries to reflect on the deceptive authentication of \"immigrant license.\" 6 Jiayang Fan also remarks that Lee's original intention is to write about \"the lives of Shenzhen factory workers\" (227). A project of investigative reporting on millions of Chinese workers, it belongs to a growing genre of such documentaries as Last Train Home (2009) and Up the Yangtze (2007), or such neorealist films as Blind Shaft (2003) and",

Whatever he observes and imagines is colored by the fear of being replaced by China as, in McHugh's words, \"the dominant world power.\" The socialist McHugh lays out a Sino-centric future, which the liberal Lee dreads, liberal in the sense that Lee's original intention was to uncover the misery of worker drones behind the China century. Either the mystery of creativity has alchemized a journalistic project into a fictional dystopia, or it may be a ruse to preempt a charge of xenophobia.

Reminiscent of Freud's repetition compulsion-repressing a trauma from consciousness yet revisiting it in subconscious nightmares or unwilled actions-the racial origin is beyond forgetting, unforgettable, inscribed on one's face and body, one's diet, one's very existence. Lee resorted to this technique at the outset of his career. Native Speaker begins with Henry Park's estranged wife leaving him a damning note, which he copies and secretes on his person.
