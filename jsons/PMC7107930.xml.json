All laboratory procedures were performed as previously reported [16]. Serial nasopharyngeal, and if intubated, endotracheal viral load, were assessed by quantitative PCR of the influenza A virus M gene [17]. The detection limit of this assay was 900 copies of RNA/mL. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were also tested. Oseltamivir resistance was directly detected in the initial positive nasopharyngeal or endotracheal sample by RT-PCR and sequencing of a 320-bp fragment of the neuraminidase gene spanning the 274 position for a C arr;T mutation [18]. The test was repeated in respiratory specimens of patients with persistently high viral load despite oseltamivir treatment. All initial respiratory tract samples were cultured in Madin Darby Canine Kidney cell line with trypsin for 7 days.",

However, unlike seasonal influenza virus, which replicates mainly in the upper respiratory tract, challenge studies in mammals showed that the pandemic virus can replicate to a high level in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts [4\u20136]. The findings of ARDS with postmortem findings of diffuse alveolar damage, reactive hemophagocytosis and lymphoid atrophy in our deceased patients were compatible with a cytokine storm and have similarly been reported in H5N1 infection [10]. Therefore, we studied the clinical characteristics, serial viral load in the respiratory specimens, and plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines in the 3 groups of patients with different levels of disease severity.",

Animal experiments and clinical studies showed that viral load increased steadily within 48 h after inoculation when the host failed to mount any innate immune response [22]. Once innate immune response was mounted, the viral load reached a plateau. Due to the later presentation of the severe cases, data on the viral load in the initial days after symptom onset were scarce. Thus, the nasopharyngeal viral load at presentation appeared to be slightly lower in the more severe groups. The later presentation of the more severe cases might have allowed more time for the recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocyte response specific to the highly homologous nucleoprotein antigen present in all influenza A viruses which can suppress the viral load.",

The finding could be related to a less effective innate and adaptive immune response together with a delay in starting antiviral therapy due to a later presentation. Fatal cases of H5N1 infection had persistently high viral load due to oseltamivir resistance [23], but oseltamivir resistance was not responsible for the slower rate of decline in viral shedding in our series, because only 1 patient was infected with oseltamivir-resistant virus who eventually survived without complication by ARDS. Although uncontrolled viral infection was unlikely to be the only cause of death or ARDS, antiviral therapy that can suppress the viral load more rapidly, such as intravenous zanamivir [24], and neutralizing antibody in convalescent plasma or hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin should be considered in randomized, control trials for the treatment of severe cases. Such strategy may accelerate clearance of their viral load, which may also reduce the excessive cytokine release.",

Plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles of the severe group were consistent with the challenged macaque model, which showed elevated levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 in their inflamed lungs [6]. When stratified by time after symptom onset, there was a significant correlation between disease severity and the level of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15 throughout the initial 10 days after symptom onset. Correlation between higher IL-6 levels and severe influenza infection has been well established in both animal and in human [26\u201327], but this correlation has not been reported for IL-10 and IL-15. As an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 is essential in dampening inflammatory response to prevent excessive host damage. Of interest, IL-10 deficiency was shown to be protective in influenza infection in mice, and high IL-10 production in elderly was associated with poorer antibody response to influenza vaccine [27, 28]. IL-15 level has been reported to be elevated among many bacterial and viral infections [29]. Despite being regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine, recent animal model suggested that high levels of IL-15 may actually decrease the level of antibody against influenza [30]. In contrast, IL-17 was lower in the more severe groups, consistent with previous studies which showed that IL-17 might help to protect against lethal influenza [31]. The use of immunomodulator in the treatment of influenza is still controversial but appeared effective when an antiviral is given concomitantly [32].",

However, bacterial isolates in our series have been covered adequately during the course of hospitalization. Other nonpulmonary complications, such as myocarditis, might have contributed to the mortality. Chronic pulmonary diseases and exacerbation of underlying pulmonary comorbidities were over-represented in the survived-without-ARDS group, suggesting that although these patients required oxygen supplementation, their prognosis was usually better than those who have respiratory decompensation due to viral pneumonitis. Thrombotic phenomena such as thrombosis in branches of pulmonary artery and splenic artery leading to wedged splenic infarct were found, which resembled those reported during the 1918 pandemic [36]. Although abdominal symptoms were reported to be an important clinical manifestation, and although an in vitro study showed that this virus could replicate to a high level in the intestinal cell line Caco-2 [21], gastrointestinal symptoms were not prominent in our cases. As in patients who developed cytokine storm, shock requiring inotropic support and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome were frequent.",

The frequent taking of clinical samples was prohibitive to the enrollment of children, and even adult patients occasionally refused serial nasopharyngeal or blood sampling. Viral load can be affected by minor differences in sampling technique, but this problem will affect all groups. The use of nasopharyngeal swabs may result in a lower viral load than nasopharyngeal aspirate, but very few of our samples were obtained by swabs. Because of the changing clinical status of individual patients, treatment regimen could not be unified and may confound the viral load and immunological profiles. In summary, a slower control of viral load and dysregulated cytokine profile are important in the pathogenesis of severe disease by this new pandemic virus. Preexisting immune impairment due to underlying diseases or genetic susceptibility in apparently immunocompetent cases should be investigated. Our findings mandate interventional studies of severe cases by other antiviral and immunomodulatory strategies.",
