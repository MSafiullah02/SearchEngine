Among them, a water extract of Ilex kaushue (IKWE) effectively inhibited HNE activity (IC 50 , 11.37 \u00b1 1.59 \u03bcg/mL). Using bioactivity-guided fractionation, one new compound and 23 known compounds were identified. Compound 6 (identified as 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid; 3,5-DCQA) exerted the most potent and selective inhibitory effect on HNE activity (IC 50 , 1.86 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcM). In a cell-based assay, 3,5-DCQA not only directly reduced superoxide generation and elastase activity but also attenuated the Src family kinase (SRKs)/ Vav signaling pathway in N-formyl-L-Met-L-Leu-L-Phe (fMLF)-stimulated human neutrophils. In an animal disease model, both 3,5-DCQA and standardized IKWE protected against lipopolysaccharideinduced ALI in mice, which provides support for their potential as candidates in the development of new therapeutic agents for neutrophilic inflammatory diseases.",

Further invasion of pathogens is prevented with the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), serine proteases, and neutrophil extracellular traps 5 . In ALI pathology, circulating neutrophils are recruited and activated by chemokines and cytokines from alveolar macrophages and alveolar-type II epithelial cells, triggering neutrophil serine protease release, alveolar edema and impaired oxygenation. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is one of the serine proteases released from activated neutrophils that cause pulmonary damage through hydrolysis of elastin-rich connective tissue. Additionally, NE acts as an inflammatory mediator and contributes to the migration and activation of neutrophils through effects on alveolar macrophage and lung epithelial cells 6 . \u03b1 1 -Antitrypsin, an endogenous secretory elastase inhibitor abundant in the peripheral alveolar region, naturally protects lung tissue from proteolysis by elastase. Enhanced NE activity has been observed due to inactivation of \u03b1 1-antitrypsin under conditions of increased oxidative stress resulted from neutrophils 4,7 . The development of NE inhibitors is therefore considered an effective therapeutic strategy for ALI 3,4 .",

Triterpenoids, polyphenols, cyanoglucosides and essential oils are the major metabolites of I. kaushue 12, 13 . Traditionally, the plant has beneficial physiological effects, including thirst quenching, elimination of phlegm for resuscitation, and removal of mucus from the lung 14 . Recent studies have additionally revealed anticancer, antidiabetes, antiobesity and antioxidant bioactivities 12,13,15-17 .

Among these, compound 19 was new, while compounds 1~8 were identified as caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) or dicaffeoylquinic acids (DCQA) based on the position and number of caffeoyl groups conjugated with quinic acid. Saccharides of 11, 14, and 15 were further hydrolyzed to generate aglycons (11-1, 11-2, 14-1, 15-1, and 15-2) for proposing structure and activity relationships (SAR). All known compounds were identified by comparing their physical and spectral data with the values provided in the literatures. Compound 1621 cm \u22121 in the IR spectrum, 13 C NMR signals at \u03b4 C 93.7 (d), 117.9 (s), 124.5 (d), 143.3 (d), 159.1 (s) and 1 H NMR signals at \u03b4 H 5.77 (s), 6.24 (d, 10 .0), 6.57 (dd, 10.0, 2.0), together with ultraviolet absorption at \u03bb max 256 nm, signifying the presence of \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 , \u03b4 -unsaturated nitrile [18] [19] [20] . NMR signals at \u03b4 H 3.66 (dd, 11.6, 8.0), 3.86 (d, 11.6), 4.48 (d, 8 .0); \u03b4 C 62.6 (t) and 102.6 (d) suggested the presence of a glucopyranosyl group. Comparison of 1D and 2D NMR spectra revealed that compound 19 is a structural isomer of menisdaurin (18) (Fig. 1B , Supplementary information Figs S2-S8 and Table S1 ) [19] [20] [21] . The strong NOE (nuclear overhauser effect) correlations between H-4 and H-5a, H-5a and H-6, and H-6 and H-1' demonstrate that compound 19 shares the same orientation of H-4 and H-6 with menisdaurin. Additionally, NOE correlations between H-6 and H-7 implied an E-configuration of the C-1/C-7 double bond in compound 19 19, 22 . The downfield shift of the H-2 signal (calculated as 0.25 ppm) additionally supported the presence of the E-configuration 19 . Based on the collective data, the structure of 19 was determined as an E-form isomer of menisdaurin (18) , designated menisdaurin F.",

Infiltrating neutrophils, thickening of the alveolar wall, lung edema and alveolar hemorrhage are pathological features of ALI 1-4 . Dark red color and morphological swelling of the lung in LPS-induced ALI mice suggested alveolar hemorrhage and edema (Fig. 5A ). In addition to hemorrhage, histological examination revealed infiltrating neutrophils and thickening of the alveolar wall in the LPS-treated group. These pathological features were significantly improved following pretreatment with IKWE (500 mg/kg) or 3,5-DCQA (50 mg/kg). Wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and branchalveloar lavage fluid (BALF) were further assessed to confirm the protective effects and determine underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that IKWE and 3,5-DCQA not only improve lung edema but also suppress accumulation of neutrophils in lung tissue (Figs 5B,C and 6A-C). Reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) were additionally observed (Fig. 6D ,E), clearly supporting the protective effects of both IKWE and 3,5-DCQA against LPS-induced ALI in mice. Besides, the post-treatment with 3,5-DCQA was performed to further evaluate its effects against LPS-induced ALI in mice 24 .",

Botanical drugs are considered to be an important resource for drug development, and they require stringent testing for efficacy, safety and quality 9 . Because of the ability of IKWE to inhibit HNE activity, the protective effects of I. kaushue against ALI were investigated, both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vivo studies, dexamethasone was used as a positive control. Although the applied dosage and possible side effects of dexamethasone in clinical settings are controversial, it is still a common positive control in ALI mouse models [25] [26] [27] . Although serine proteases are responsible for several physiological functions in humans, abnormal and excessive levels can cause or promote disease 28, 29 . Recent experimental and clinical studies have shown that enhanced HNE activity is associated with the degradation of elastin-rich proteins in the pathological progression of ALI. Consequently, HNE is considered to be a promising therapeutic target for treating ALI 4, 28, 30 . In our experiments, 3,5-DCQA exhibited high selectivity for HNE among the five serine proteases that were examined. Further exploration of the SAR of the caffeic acid analogues showed that the inhibitory effects on HNE activity of the compounds did not depend on the caffeic acid moiety, but were correlated with the regioselectivity of caffeic acids conjugated to quinic acid (Supplementary information Table S3 ).",

The production of superoxide anions from human neutrophils can be reduced through intracellular mechanisms or ROS scavenging agents 4,30 . 3,5-DCQA was previously reported to be a ROS-scavenger and to exert anti-oxidant effects 31 . The ortho-dihydroxyphenyl moiety significantly promotes ROS scavenging activity via a highly favorable electron acceptance and resonance system 32, 33 . Our results showed that all caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, together with CA, RA and THBA, potently inhibit O 2 .\u2212 generation in neutrophils (Table 2 ). In contrast, compounds p-CA, 3-HCA and FA were non-active because the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl group was absent. Interestingly, the HNE inhibitory effects of 3,5-DCQA decreased in fMLF-induced neutrophils, which was demonstrated by comparing the results of an enzyme inhibition assay. To eliminate the influence of O 2 .\u2212 generation, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was used as an inducer in human neutrophils (Supplementary information Table S2) , which led to the recovery of 3,5-DCQA-induced HNE inhibition 34 . These data confirmed that 3,5-DCQA at a high dose (100 \u03bc M) was able to inhibit elastase release, myeloperoxidase activity and superoxide production in human neutrophils 35 . SFKs belong to the family of tyrosine kinases and play important roles in neutrophil activation 36, 37 . Previous reports have shown that SFKs are responsible for O 2 .\u2212 generation and cell migration in fMLF-stimulated neutrophils 36 . In addition, SFKs have been shown to cause elevated expression of TNF-\u03b1 and chemokines in LPS-induced neutrophils 37 . These effects have been inhibited effectively by PP2, a highly selective SFK inhibitor 36, 37 . Vav, a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family, causes activation of NADPH oxidase by activating Rac 38 . A previous study revealed that SFKs were able to enhance Vav phosphorylation and activity 39 . Our immunoblotting assay showed that 3,5-DCQA inhibited SFKs and Vav phosphorylation in fMLF-induced neutrophils, which suggests that 3,5-DCQA might attenuate O 2 .\u2212 generation, cell migration and TNF-\u03b1 and chemokine expression in stimulated neutrophils through the SFKs/Vav signaling pathway. Other signaling proteins such as ERK, p38 and Akt are also important in neutrophil activation 36 . However, 3,5-DCQA does not reduce the levels of phosphorylated ERK, p38, and Akt. Based on enzyme-based and cell-based data, we proposed that 3,5-DCQA modulates neutrophil function through intercellular and intracellular mechanisms simultaneously.",

These adhesion proteins promote neutrophil attachment to endothelial cells and firm their migration 30 . Chlorogenic acid (3) is another major chemical component in I.

Neutrophil elastase has been shown to stimulate TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression in macrophages 44 . A previous study demonstrated that 3,5-DCQA was able to reduce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells 45 . In the current study, 3,5-DCQA inhibited neutrophil elastase and reduced BALF inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. These suggested that 3,5-DCQA might be able to modulate macrophage function by inhibiting elastase and intracellular mechanisms simultaneously 44 .",

Agents were dissolved in vehicle solution (PBS containing 10% Tween-80). All animals were pretreated intraperitoneally with 100 \u03bc L vehicle solution or agents, respectively, 1 h before PBS or LPS (Sigma, Escherichia coli. 055:B5) intratracheal injection (5 mg/kg in 50 \u03bc L of PBS) 26, 27 . Mice were sacrificed at 6 h post-dosage, and the left lung collected for histological examination or MPO activity measurement. Lung tissue was fixed with 10% formalin before embedding with paraffin wax and routine H&E staining. MPO activity was measured as described earlier 59 . The right lobes were prepared for W/D weight ratio determination or BALF analysis. To obtain the W/D weight ratio, wet tissues were weighed immediately after collection, dried in the oven at 80 \u00b0C for 48 h, and re-weighed. For post-treatment experiments, mice treated with vehicle or 3,5-DCQA (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 1 h after LPS treatment 24 . Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid preparation and analysis. Mice were sacrificed and hilum of the left lung sealed. BALF was collected following injection with 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3 or 0.5 mL PBS. BALF samples were combined and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Total proteins in the supernatant fraction were determined using the protein assay dye (BIO-RAD, 500-0006) with BSA as the reference, and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels measured with ELISA kits (eBioscience, 88-7324-88 and 88-7064-88). Cell pellets from BALF were resuspended in 100 \u03bc L PBS and cytospun (200 g, 3 min) onto a glass microscope slide, followed by staining with Liu's stain. Neutrophils were counted under a light microscope in five randomly selected fields (\u00d7 200 magnification) 60 .",
