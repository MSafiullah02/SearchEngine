We agreed that the COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic crisis which has generated an unprecedented amount of substantial medical knowledge in a compressed amount of time. Thus, the journal\u2019s call for COVID-19\u2013related papers and the act of removing the paid barrier to open access of this information are important steps in informing the medical community. At the time of writing this article in late April 2020, there are already over 38 related articles published in Anesthesia & Analgesia in the journal\u2019s COVID-19 collection. This demonstrates the rapid pace with which new information is being developed by physicians internationally, and the great interest taken by the anesthesiology community.",

In the midst of the pandemic, even those within the medical community have found it challenging to sort out the literature to answer the questions necessary for their practice, the safety of their patients, and that of themselves. More than ever, acquisition and proper dissemination of such knowledge in a quickly digestible form areurgent for all medical staff to properly and safely treat COVID-19 patients.",

To combat the pandemic and remove the burden on anesthesiology providers from the waterfall of information over the past few months, a COVID-19 anesthesiology taskforce was established at our institution. Commonly occurring questions and issues (Table) were directed to the taskforce from the anesthesiology departments and perioperative staff. Many of these questions have no definitive guidelines or evidence. The answers provided here were primarily based on the current institutional practices and may not apply to other institutions. This information is not intended to replace medical literature or published guidelines, but rather is focused on sharing common questions from anesthesiologists in an academic center to alleviate some of the cognitive, emotional, and physical burden from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
