(In vivo, the most dramatic consequence is the effacement of the brush border microvilli); (iii) intimate attachment to the exposed enterocyte cytoplasmic membrane, mediated by an outer membrane protein, intimin, with polymerisation of actin filaments underneath the zone of adherence of the bacteria and enhancement of the cytoskeleton rearrangements; and (iv) penetration of the bacteria into the cells. The VT/Stx toxins play no role in the development of the AE lesions, but cause damage to the intestinal wall vessels resulting in haemorrhages and dysentery in humans and calves. In humans, they also cause damage to the arterioles of the kidneys, resulting in the HUS [19], [24], [25].",

They received 300 millilitres of colostrum which was negative by ELISA and agglutination against strain 340S89. At six hours of age, three of them were challenged orally with 109 to 1010 CFU of strain 340S89 suspended in sterile saline and the fourth one with saline only. Strain 340S89 was grown on Meat extract Agar slants (Oxo\u00efd, Gent, Belgium) for six hours aerobically at 37 \u00b0C. The bacteria were resuspended in sterile saline and the optical density at 620 nm was adjusted to obtain a bacterial concentration between 109 to 1010 per 200 mL. The exact concentration was calculated after inoculation of tenfold dilutions of the suspension onto Gassner agar plates (Belgolabo, Overijse, Belgium). This medium was used to select enteric bacteria. Moreover, it provided the opportunity to make a differentiate between coliforms thanks to his lactose activity [11]. The calves were subsequently fed twice a day with two liters of UHT whole milk. Clinical investigations and faecal sampling were performed every four hours. Faecal samples were tested by ELISA (trousse ELISA digestive, BioX, Brussels, Belgium) for the presence of K99 enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Crytosporidium sp. The excretion of the challenge strain was followed by bacteriological examination and by PCR.",

Arguments in favour of a role of the O118:H16 EHEC strain are: (i) challenge with a nontoxigenic F17-producing E. coli strain resulted in the absence of any clinical signs (Van Bost and Mainil, unpublished data); (ii) the colonization of the gut was still high as attested by the faecal excretion even after the disappearance of the diarrhoea (figure 1).

Other factors must thus be considered: the presence of other diarrhoeagenic agents, such as a rotavirus in calf 2; the age of the animal and its genetic background; loss of some bacterial virulence genes during storage. Coexistence between EPEC/EHEC strains and other diarrhoeagenic agents has already been noticed in field studies and may be related to the severity and persistance of diarrhoea in farms [5]. The age of the animal is also important: with strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11 clinical signs could not be reproduced in calves aged one to two weeks but could be reproduced well in newborn calves [1], [6], [7], [18]. The opposite situation may exist for strains belonging to other serotypes, mimicking the situation of EPEC in rabbits [21], [26].",

The role of VT1 produced by most cattle EHEC [17], [19] is actually still unknown. Challenge experiments with the wild-type strain and isogenic mutants in the genes coding for the verotoxins may bring an answer to this question.",

It is also worth noting that strain 340S89, and several other EHEC and EPEC bovine strains, give images of internalization into the enterocytes when tested in the rabbit ligated intestinal loop assay [4], [12]. The significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria. Indeed, the challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves. However the challenge strain was never detected in other organs or in heart blood.",
