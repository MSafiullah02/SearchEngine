Hence, prescribing antibiotics in 23 4 those patients with known comorbidities cannot be excluded e.g. COPD exacerbations with 1 purulent sputum or when radiological evidence of pneumonia. However, it imperative that a 2 tailored decision process toward lab workup might not be sensitive navigating an unknown 3 terrain with COVID 19 is a challenge. 4 Such that, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological differences between patients who 5 were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit have yet to be conclusive in our cohort of 6 patients. There is no current study to delineate the structural changes that coronavirus can impact our 9 population cohort and give if any will be in the future. Those studies will have limited resources 10 and numbers of patients in these studies will be relatively small and infer nothing substantial to 11 teach current and future generations. 12 In addition to what has been mentioned above, the clinical characteristics of patients who died 13 are scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 has yet been shown to be 14 effective, hence supportive therapeutics to ameliorate and protect multi-organ function is crucial 15 (13) . The changing clinical terrain and our ability to reconnoitre the surface is limited. The truth to the matter is that we are unable to yet comprehend the scale of this effect on the 12 health sector, to say the least. The reduction in taskforce due to COVID lockdown and social 13 isolation has impacted the running of financial output precisely. Staffing and capacity to care for patients. For many of the elements presented above, it is difficult to predict how a specific power would 5 be used in a specific context, and therefore monetized costs would be hard to assess and evaluate 6 until the cloud has dispersed. The fight against this disease and its spectral elusive outcomes are yet to unravel. The inclusive 10 totality of repercussions on our patients' cohorts will be delineated in the immediate future post 11 COVID era.
