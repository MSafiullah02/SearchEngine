            "text": "A wide variety of respiratory viruses will also cause significant morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised. Measles is an important respiratory pathogen in the immunocompromised host and it must be remembered that the typical rash may not develop. Mortality can be high, especially amongst patients with leukaemia and those undergoing HSCT. A prospective multi-center review of patients undergoing HSCT found direct RSV-associated mortality to be 17.4%, and mortality directly attributable to influenza A to be 15.3% (Ljungman et al., 2001). Respiratory viruses often present with non-specific symptoms but progress to a significant lower respiratory tract infection. Chest x-ray will often show a pneumonitis picture with diffuse interstitial changes. HRCT may show peri-bronchial thickening and ground glass attenuation without consolidation in a lobular distribution. Diagnosis requires identification of the organism from respiratory secretions. This may be possible on nasopharyngeal secretions or throat swab but may require more invasive testing, such as bronchoscopy and BAL. Laboratory techniques include immunofluorescence, PCR and viral culture. Treatment is mainly supportive, but specific treatment options are evolving, making rapid and accurate diagnosis increasingly important. Appropriate isolation and infection-control measures are essential to prevent transmission between immunocompromised patients, as these viruses can be easily spread. One UK study in a HSCT unit identified 10 cases of RSV over one winter season, and eight of the nine RSV strains that could be tested by molecular methods were found to be identical (Taylor et al., 2001).",

Combinations of inhaled ribavirin and intravenous palivizumab have shown encouraging results.

Evidence is limited but a recent review has indicated that nitazoxanide may reduce parasite load and therefore be useful (Abubakar et al., 2007). In the authors\u2019 experience, azithromycin and nitazoxanide are safer options in post-HSCT patients, as paromomycin has been associated with significant hearing loss, particularly when given with ciclosporin. Supportive care remains essential. In those with HIV, anti-retroviral therapy, with its associated improvement in CD4 count, can result in improvement in the Cryptosporidium infection.",

Those most at risk are patients who receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant, those with active graft versus host disease and those who receive total body irradiation. There are a number of different species of adenovirus, and these are divided into serotypes, some of which are primarily associated with the respiratory tract, while others have a predilection for the gastrointestinal tract. Young children are particularly vulnerable, as they often carry adenovirus in their gastrointestinal tract, predisposing them to reactivation and dissemination when they become immunocompromised. In view of this, screening can be important in the immunocompromised and adenovirus is usually identified in urine, stool, or sometimes respiratory secretions prior to being identified in blood. A study of 132 patients undergoing HSCT were screened for adenovirus in stool, urine, on throat swab and in peripheral blood during the post transplant period. 27% had a positive adenoviral PCR on at least one screening test, but this was not associated with clinical signs unless it was detected in peripheral blood and, even then, there was a median delay of 3 weeks from first detection of adenovirus until the patient demonstrated clinical signs. In one study, mortality was as high as 82% in those with adenovirus detected on peripheral blood. This highlights the importance of early recognition and consideration of pre-emptive use of antivirals (Lion et al., 2003).",

There was wide variation in the definition of fever (from persistent temperature higher than 37.5\u00b0C to a single reading of 39\u00b0C) and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1 \u00d7 109, < 0.75 \u00d7 109 or < 0.5 \u00d7 109). Empirical antibiotic regimes also varied greatly, including aminoglycosides plus a second agent (piperacillin based, cephalosporin or carbapenem), carbapenem alone or, in two cases, cefuroxime plus flucloxacillin and ciprofloxacin plus ceftazidime. Timing of the anti-fungal therapy was even more variable, in terms of when to start and the duration of empirical treatment. Some of this variation can be explained by variations in organisms isolated and antibiotic sensitivity from unit to unit, but this does not seem to account for all the differences in practice.
