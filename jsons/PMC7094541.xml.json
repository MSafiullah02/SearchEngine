HPS was first recognized in 1993 in the four-corners region of the southwestern United States. The virus is shed in the urine, feces, or saliva of rodents of the family Muridae, and transmission to humans occurs via the inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported in the United States, but a few cases have been described in Argentina and Chile involving a specific strain, Andes virus. Sin Nombre virus (SNV), a Hantavirus common in the southwestern United States, is associated with a severe form of HPS that has a case fatality rate of 40 to 50%. The reservoir for SNV is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which is one of the most common small mammals in the United States. Most cases of HPS occur during the spring and summer months, though, depending on climate conditions, patients may present in the winter months. Our patient died in February.",

The disease typically progresses from a nonspecific febrile prodrome to a fulminant cardiopulmonary phase, followed by a recovery phase in survivors. Following an incubation period of about 2 to 3 weeks (range, 14 to 32 days), the prodrome phase is characterized by fever, chills, myalgias, and headache. Nausea, vomiting, and malaise can also be seen, but some classic features of upper respiratory tract infection such as rhinorrhea and pharyngitis are absent. Early laboratory findings may be normal, but thrombocytopenia and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels can be seen. The prodrome phase usually lasts 2 to 5 days.",

As seen in our patient, this transition can occur rapidly, in as little as 4 h, and has led to recommendations for the transfer of these patients to tertiary care centers at the earliest signs of HPS. Bronchorrhea with copious proteinaceous edema fluid, with or without diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, can be seen. Laboratory findings during this phase include marked leukocytosis with a leftward shift, worsening thrombocytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase, hemoconcentration, and low serum albumin due to capillary leak. Additional findings on the peripheral blood smear that are highly suggestive of HPS include a relative lack of toxic granulation of the neutrophils, and immunoblasts accounting for \u226510% of the total lymphocyte population. An elevated serum lactate level, which is associated with poor outcome, can be seen in severe cases; in one early series, all patients with a peak serum lactate concentration of >4 mmol/L died.",

Few centers have onsite testing, so a presumptive diagnosis based on exposure history and clinical presentation is usually necessary to guide therapy. There is no effective antiviral therapy for HPS, with a controlled trial of IV ribavirin in North America showing no benefit. ICU support with mechanical ventilation, the early use of pressors, and the avoidance of volume overload are recommended. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used for treatment in centers where it can be initiated expeditiously; it seems to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with severe hypoxemia and depressed cardiac function.",
