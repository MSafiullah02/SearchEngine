AI is one of such technology which can easily track the spread of this virus, identifies the high-risk patients, and is useful in controlling this infection in real-time. It can also predict mortality risk by adequately analyzing the previous data of the patients. AI can help us to fight this virus by population screening, medical help, notification, and suggestions about the infection control [[1], [2], [3]]. This technology has the potential to improve the planning, treatment and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool.
