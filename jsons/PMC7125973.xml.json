HRSV is an important respiratory pathogen, causing approximately 30 million cases of acute lower respiratory tract disease in children under 5 annually, some 10% of which require hospitalisation [2]. Most infants recover from a natural HRSV infection but some suffer a fatal outcome [3]. Since long-term immunity is not established, infections reoccur throughout life [4] and in elderly or immunocompromised individuals, these can lead to serious complications [5].",

Subsequently, many HRSV vaccine strategies have been investigated [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], however no clinically successful candidate has emerged. HRSV vaccine candidates are often investigated in mice, although very high challenge doses are required to give disease and even then, pathogenesis does not match that seen in severely affected human infants [15]. In contrast, low doses of PVM in its natural rodent host give clinical signs ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to fatal pneumonia [16] with pathogenesis that closely resembles severe HRSV disease in humans, making it an appropriate system for investigating pneumovirus pathogenesis and immune responses [17], [18].",

            "text": "HRSV vaccine strategies have focused on stimulating a strong systemic humoral response against the F and G glycoproteins [11], [19]. However, the natural response that resolves pneumovirus infection is primarily mediated through CD8+ T-cells [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) have been widely developed as vaccine candidates, including to deliver HRSV glycoproteins [13], [19], [25], [26], and typically elicit potent TH1-biased responses [27]. We therefore evaluated intranasal (i.n.) delivery of human rAd type 5 (rAd5) PVM recombinants in the mouse as a model for protection against pneumoviruses. We selected this route since it was superior to intramuscular (i.m) delivery in providing protection against either lethal influenza A virus challenge or HRSV replication in the lung [13], [28]; it is also now an established route for human vaccination [29]. We focused on the internal proteins M and N since they contain potent cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) epitopes in HRSV [30], [31] and H-2Db and H-2Kb restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes in PVM [32], [33]. Furthermore, vaccinating calves with N protein vectors primed BRSV-specific T cells and conferred partial protection against BRSV challenge [34], [35] and mucosal immunisation of mice with HRSV N protein nanoparticles induced both specific antibody and T cell responses, and reduced HRSV pulmonary replication [36]. We show here that rAd5 containing the M or N gene of PVM is able to elicit long-term protection against lethal PVM infection in mice, correlating with the stimulation of PVM-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations.",

Whilst rAd5M-immunised animals showed some weight loss, particularly following prolonged delay between immunisation and challenge, this was transient and less severe than in rAd5Z-immunised mice, which showed severe disease similar to the mock-immunised animals (Fig. 3C).

Although some rAd5M-immunised animals possessed anti-PVM IgG at weeks 6, 8 and 11 (Fig. 5A), at no time point did any more than a minority show a response. For rAd5N, only one animal developed detectable anti-PVM IgG by week 6 but the numbers responding and magnitude of response increased in weeks 8 and 11 (Fig. 5B); again, only a minority showed a detectable response at any time point and anti-PVM IgG antibodies were no longer detectable by week 20. As expected, rAd5Z elicited no detectable anti-PVM IgG at any time (Fig. 5C). In contrast, all animals mounted a detectable anti-Ad5 response, confirming delivery of the immunogen (Fig. 5D\u2013F). The absence of consistent anti-PVM antibody responses in the context of consistent protection from lethal PVM challenge suggested that an anti-PVM IgG response was not the primary mechanism of protection.",

In contrast, no PVM-specific CD8+ T-cells were observed (data not shown). However, 7 days after immunisation with three doses of 107\n pfu of rAd5N, 2 weeks apart, the majority of PVM-specific T-cells induced by rAd5N in the spleen were CD8+ T cells (9.2% CD8+IFN\u03b3+ compared with 2.04% CD4+IFN\u03b3+, Fig. 6\n). Notably, PVM-specific T-cells were not detected in lung lymphocytes from these mice (data not shown); this may have been related to the high background IFN\u03b3 response observed in lung lymphocytes from these animals. As PVM-specific T cells were not elicited by rAd5Z (Fig. 6), the PVM-specific CD4+ and CD8+ splenocytes in rAd5N-immunised animals demonstrate that rAd5N induces a significant PVM-specific T-cell response.",

Notably, anti-PVM IgG had declined to undetectable levels by 20 weeks post immunisation yet all animals were still protected. Specific protection was not explained by priming for a rapid PVM-specific antibody response as there was no difference in specific IgG titres between rAd5N-immunised and control vector or rAd5Z-immunised animals post-challenge (data not shown). PVM-specific antibody responses might be weak because PVM M and N proteins do not contain strong B-cell epitopes or because the route of administration could not elicit such responses. The latter is unlikely since rAd5 expressing HRSV antigens elicited good serum IgG responses when delivered by the i.n. route [13], [26] and our immunisations reliably elicited Ad5-specific IgG. We also considered whether our protocol might have elicited greater mucosal than serum antibody responses, however we did not detect any PVM-specific IgA in BAL fluid obtained from vaccinated mice. Therefore, whilst it remains possible that rAd5N and rAd5M each elicited some form of antibody that our assays could not detect and which was the basis of protection, we consider this unlikely.",

In contrast to PVM rAd5 studied here, vaccination with a chimpanzee rAd (PanAd3) expressing F, N and M2-1 caused accelerated onset of weight loss in mice following HRSV challenge, a difference most likely due to the high titre HRSV challenge inoculum encountering a strong CD8+ response induced by M2-1 [46].

A similar finding of non-specific protection was reported previously in ferrets immunised with high dose rAd: though having no effect on SARS coronavirus replication in the nose, control rAd reduced virus penetration into the lung and consequent pathology [47]. Many other studies of rAd immunisation have not included both empty rAd and non-immunised controls so any non-specific protection would not have been detected. In one further study that incorporated both controls, non-specific protection in the airway was not seen after rAd delivery to mice i.m.
