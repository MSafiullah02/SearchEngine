In comparison to intravenous route, nebulized aminoglycosides and colistin can achieve significantly higher lung tissue concentrations necessary for the effective treatment of VAP due to MDR GNB [1, 2] . For colistin, this is achieved with minimal systemic toxicity compared to intravenous administration. Demonstration of high lung tissue deposition following nebulization is difficult in humans as epithelial lining fluid concentrations may be in part falsely elevated because of a heavy contamination of the bronchoscope during bronchoalveolar lavage ( Fig. 1e-i) [5] . Evidence of high lung tissue concentrations relies on microdialysis [2] or open lung biopsies [1] that can be performed exclusively in experimental studies.",

In pneumonia, high antibiotic tissue concentrations are also observed but are heterogeneously distributed, and likely influenced by the aeration loss [6, 7] . Peak tissue concentrations remain high in non-aerated lung regions, indicating that aminoglycosides and colistin likely diffuse through bronchiolar mucosa towards adjacent consolidated infected alveoli. Both are concentration-dependent antibiotics with peak interstitial concentrations determining bactericidality. Systemic diffusion of nebulized aminoglycosides is substantial, increasing when the alveolar-capillary membrane is injured by a microorganism [1] . The peak plasma concentration is observed 1 h following nebulisation, with a subsequent bi-compartmental time-dependent decrease. Trough plasma concentrations, which determine the toxicity risk, are similar to those resulting from the intravenous administration when the nebulized dose is equal to the intravenous dose plus extrapulmonary deposition (Fig. 1k) . In contrast, systemic diffusion of nebulized colistin is weak even in the presence of extensive VAP (Fig. 1j) , protecting against nephrotoxicity [1, 7, 8] and offering the possibility of delivering very high doses by nebulization. Measured colistin plasma concentrations result from the hydrolysis of the nebulized prodrug colistin methanesulfonate [9] .",

The combination of nebulized and intravenous aminoglycosides is likely to increase the risk of toxicity. When added to intravenous betalactams, nebulized aminoglycosides do not improve therapeutic efficacy in VAP caused by susceptible GNB, likely because double-antimicrobial therapy is not superior to monotherapy. The addition of nebulized to intravenous colistin increases lung tissue concentrations but not plasma concentrations. Thus, it improves efficacy without increasing systemic toxicity. Compared to adjunctive therapy, substitution therapy markedly reduces colistin plasma concentrations and decreases the risk of toxicity as shown in a recent meta-analysis [10] . This is the reason why the ESCMID position paper recommended to perform future randomized control studies comparing substitution therapy (rather than adjunctive therapy), to intravenous administration [4] . The FSAICM and FICS also recommended the use of substitution rather than adjunctive therapy in VAP caused by MDR GNB susceptible to colistin and/or aminoglycosides [11] .",

In vitro, mesh nebulizers appear superior over jet nebulizers to deliver tobramycin [15] . Aerosol particle size is slightly smaller with jet nebulizers compared to mesh nebulizers, but always remained below five microns, a condition required to reach the distal lung. Lung dose is significantly higher with mesh nebulizers whereas nebulization time and residual volume are significantly reduced. These in vitro benefits were confirmed in animals and in patients treated by salbutamol [16] [17] [18] .",

The vibrationinduced micro-pumping effect produces a fine particle, low velocity aerosol. The mass median aerodynamic diameter depends and the holes' diameter; d specific respirator tubings with smooth angle and inner surface; e-i illustrations of tracheobronchial deposition of aerosol particles. Scintigraphic images representing airways and lung deposition of an aerosol of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid labeled with technetium-99 m are shown in e-h. Images were obtained in four postoperative neurosurgery patients without pulmonary disease ventilated either in volume-controlled ventilation (n = 2, e and f) or in pressure support ventilation (n =",
