            "text": "Spatial spread of infectious diseases among populations via the mobility of humans is highly stochastic and heterogeneous. Accurate forecast/mining of the spread process is often hard to be achieved by using statistical or mechanical models. Here we propose a new reverse problem, which aims to identify the stochastically spatial spread process itself from observable information regarding the arrival history of infectious cases in each subpopulation. We solved the problem by developing an efficient optimization algorithm based on dynamical programming, which comprises three procedures: i, anatomizing the whole spread process among all subpopulations into disjoint componential patches; ii, inferring the most probable invasion pathways underlying each patch via maximum likelihood estimation; iii, recovering the whole process by assembling the invasion pathways in each patch iteratively, without burdens in parameter calibrations and computer simulations. Based on the entropy theory, we introduced an identifiability measure to assess the difficulty level that an invasion pathway can be identified. Results on both artificial and empirical metapopulation networks show the robust performance in identifying actual invasion pathways driving pandemic spread.",

In the study of network epidemiology, networks are often used to describe the epidemic spreading from human to human via contacts, where nodes represent persons and edges represent interpersonal contacts [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . To characterize the spatial spread between different geo-locations, simple network models are generalized with metapopulation framework, in which each node represents a population of individuals that reside at the same geo-region (e.g. a city), and the edge describes the traffic route that drives the individual mobility between populations [18] , [19] . The networked metapopulation models have been applied to study the real-world cases such as SARS [6] , A (H1N1) pandemic flu [23] , Ebola [11] , which can capture some key dynamic features including peak times, basic epidemic curves, and epidemic sizes. Quantitative model results can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , such as optimizing the vaccine allocation.",

The model calibrations need highresolution data for incidence cases, which may not be available or accurate during the early weeks of initial outbreaks [4] . Hence, continuous model training with data collected in realtime is essential in achieving a reliable model prediction [29] . Generally, model results are the ensemble average over numerous simulation realizations, which aims to predict the mean and variance of epidemic curves, while in reality there is no such thing described by the average over different realizations [30] . To extract more meaningful information from epidemic data generated by surveillance systems, recent studies (particularly in engineering fields) start paying attention to reverse problems, such as source detection and network reconstruction, which are briefly summarized here.",

The target is to figure out the causality that can trigger the explosive dissemination across social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo. For example, using maximum likelihood estimators, D. Shah and T. Zaman [32] proposed the concept of rumor centrality that quantifies the role of nodes in network spreading. W. Luo et al. [33] designed new estimators to infer infection sources and regions in large networks. Z. Wang et al. [34] [35] [36] extended the scope by using multiple observations, which largely improves the detection accuracy. Another interesting topic is the network inference, which engages in revealing the topology structure of a network from the hint underlying the dynamics on a network [37] . Some useful algorithms (e.g. NetInf) have been proposed in refs. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] .

Firstly, the whole spread process among all populations will be decomposed into disjoint componential patches, which can be categorized into four types of invasion cases. Then, since two types of invasion cases contain hidden pathways, an optimization approach based on the maximum likelihood estimation is developed to infer the most probable invasion pathways underlying each path. Finally, the whole spread process will be recovered by assembling the invasion pathways of each patch chronologically, without burdens in parameter calibrations and computer simulations. iii) An entropy-based measure called identifiability is introduced to depict the difficulty level an invasion case can be identified. Comparisons on both artificial and empirical networks show that our algorithm outperforms the existing methods in accuracy and robustness.",

For each invasion case, by analyzing the variance of infected hosts in each subpopulation i, we define three levels of extent of subpopulations observability to reflect the information held for the inference of relevant invasion pathway: (i) Observable Subpopulation: Subpopulation i is observable during an invasion case, given the occurrence of the three most evident (subpopulation's) status transitions. The first refers to the transition S i \u2192 I i , accounting that the previously unaffected subpopulation i is contaminated during that invasion case due to the arrival of infected hosts. The second concerns the transition I i \u2192 S i , in which the previously infected subpopulation i becomes susceptible again during that invasion case, since the infected hosts do not trigger a local outbreak and leave i. In the third transition S i \u2192 S i , despite of having infected subpopulations in the neighborhood, subpopulation i remains unaffected during that invasion case due to no arrival of infected hosts. Figure 3 (a) illustrates such observable transitions. (ii) Partially Observable Subpopulation: Subpopulation i is partially observable during an invasion case occurring at time t, if its number of infected hosts is decreased, i.e., I i (t) < I i (t \u2212 1) and I i (t) > 0, which implies that at least \u2206I i (t) = |I i (t) \u2212 I i (t \u2212 1)| infected hosts leave i during that invasion case. It is impossible to distinguish their mobility destinations unless the invasion case I \u2192 S or I \u2192 nS occurs. Fig. 3 (b) illustrates the partially observable subpopulation.

We first anatomize the whole invasion pathway into four classes of invasion cases at each epidemic arrival time. Then we identify four classes of invasion cases, and reconstruct the whole invasion pathway from the source subpopulation of a spreading process. We introduce the concept of identifiability to quantitatively analyze the difficulty level that an invasion case can be identified. The simulation results on the American Airports Network (AAN) and large-scale BA networked metapopulation have demonstrated our algorithm held a robust performance to identify the spatial invasion pathway, especially for the early stage of an epidemic. We conjecture the proposed IPI algorithm framework can extend to the problems of virus diffusion in computer network, human to human's epidemic contact network, and the reaction dynamics may extend to the SIR or SIS dynamics.",
