The fact that nucleoprotein is a protein and a protein is a object allows the transitive conclusion to be drawn that nucleoprotein is a object. Although this relationship may be obvious, the ability to express it in formal terms is a step towards automating the discovery of new relationships. A formal ontology (Fig. 1c ) expands upon the concept of a taxonomy in that it allows for multiple types of relationships between and among objects.

In short, many domain-specific ontologies are under development by the respective experts in their fields.

BFO intends to be a high-level ontology from which more focused domain-specific ontologies can be developed. At its most basic level, BFO divides the world into continuants and occurrents. Continuants are entities that persist through time and are further divided into independent and dependent continuants. Independent continuants are defined as bearers of qualities and include OBI material entities (e.g., instruments, organisms, cells, proteins). Dependent continuants are entities that are intrinsic to or borne by other entities. These include things like qualities (e.g., mass, shape), and roles (drug, placebo) that require an independent continuant to exist. Occurrents make up the second major branch of the BFO hierarchy and are defined as entities that unfold over time. OBI further divides these into planned (e.g., experiments) and unplanned (e.g., diseases) processes. A partial schema of the hierarchy is depicted in Fig. 2. In the next section, we describe how the integration into this high level structure has effected the development of ONTIE. It is important to point out that OBI and, to a lesser degree, BFO are still under active development and their topology may change.

The first two of these correspond to different steps of the experiment, and are clearly processes as they occur over time. The others are objects playing specific roles. For example, the same type of protein can be the immunogen in the immunization protocol and the antigen in the ELISPOT assay. Similarly, the same type of cell type can play the role of an effector cell and antigen presenting cell. In other words, these are structurally the same objects playing different roles in different processes. Examples for distinct types of objects, on the other hand, are organisms, cells, or proteins.

This experiment starts with an Immunization protocol with a na\u00efve (in the immunological sense) mouse (playing the role of host) and SARS coronavirus nucleoprotein (playing the role of immunogen) as an input and an immunized mouse as an output. The immunized mouse is input for an organ harvesting protocol that produces mouse lymph nodes as output. Lymph cells are next generated as output from a cell isolation protocol. This yields a mixture of T cells and potential antigen presenting cells (APC) among other cell types. These protocols are labeled N/A for IEDB as they are not explicitly captured. In the next protocol (ELISPOT assay) a peptide that can be derived from the protein administered in the first protocol, is administered as the antigen, to the isolated cell mixture. APCs present bound peptide on their surface via MHC molecules. T cells specific for this peptide will bind to the peptide-MHC complex and become activated This results in the secretion of interferon g (IFN-g). Next, labeled antibodies specific for IFN-g are added and bind to IFN-g bound to the plate via a capture antibody (not depicted) in the vicinity of these activated T cells. In the next step -Spot counting, the plate is scanned by an instrument and spots are counted where labeled antibodies have bound. The final step -Data acquisition -is the transformation of the raw count to a frequency measurement followed by encoding into a digital format These proxy for relations form a chain that can be traversed all the way back to the immune response. That is, the spot count is proxy for the SFC, which is proxy for the activation of T cells, which is proxy for the frequency of epitope specific T cells induced by the immunization protocol. The intermediate steps can be subsumed so that the count of spots is ultimately proxy for the frequency of epitope-specific T cells induced by the immunization protocol.",

The SARS Coronavirus typically has many copies of the nucleoprotein in the virion. The nucleoprotein is derived from the virus and, conversely, the virus is the source of the nucleoprotein. The peptide is identical to a particular stretch of amino acids in the nucleoprotein and can therefore serve as material proxy for that region of the nucleoprotein in experiments. If it was created by digesting the nucleoprotein, then it would have a derived from/source of inverse relationship plethora of other ontologies developed under the OBO foundry. Simultaneously, we redesigned the IEDB data structure to follow the principles of the ontology and house a representation of the data that will be easier to maintain and extend.
