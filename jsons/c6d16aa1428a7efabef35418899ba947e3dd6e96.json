However, restricted hand movement and higher production costs may be a caveat. Also, those devices were not developed for use during surgical procedures. Our prototype, on the other hand, provides greater mobility, since the plastic sheet is more malleable, when comparing to more rigid structures such as acrylic. The metallic frame has also a curved shape on its sides where surgeons can be positioned closer to the patient without compromising safety, therefore preserving ergonomics.

The present work presents a prototype device for a barrier enclosure which can be used during open surgeries such as tracheotomy. This collective protection equipment (CPE) was developed at Walter Cantidio University Hospital at the University of Cear\u00e1 Medical School, with the purpose of usage at public hospitals in developing countries. We also enumerate some considerations to be performed during tracheotomies in COVIDsection we describe all steps involved during tracheotomy of COVID-19 patients in our institution, as well as de devices used during the procedure. The barrier enclosure device presented here, called COVID-Box, was developed by the Surgical Airway Team for COVID-19 Pandemic, with collaboration of the Chief Nurse of the Operative Room at Walter Cantidio University Hospital and the Medical Engineering Department of the University of Cear\u00e1 Medical School. The Surgical Airway Team for COVID-19 Pandemic is a temporary task force formed by Walter Cantidio University Hospital medical staff, consisting of experienced head and neck surgeons, thoracic surgeons and otolaryngologists.",

            "text": "forming a bottomless box. The latter part consists on a 2 x 2 meters transparent polyethylene plastic sheet, with 90g/m 2 grammage. Details of the metallic structure of the COVID-Box are shown in figure 1. Preparation of the Patient and Surgical Field Patient should have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease, and indications of tracheotomy should be accessed by the surgical team. The major indication for tracheotomy is prolonged intubation, for which tracheotomy could be performed up to 21 days after mechanical ventilation has initiated. Tracheotomy before 21 days or other indications should be evaluated individually. Patient should be adequately positioned in ICU bed, with neck extension when feasible. After skin preparation and positioning of sterile fields, preparation of the COVID-Box follows. Firstly, all suction tubes and electrosurgical equipment are positioned on the top of patient's core, securely placed by towel clamps. We made an adaption on the electrosurgical hand piece, placing the tip of the surgical pencil through a 12Fr disposable PVC suction catheter, in order to continuing aspirate aerosols generated by the electric scalpel (figure 2). Secondly, the COVID-Box metallic structure (sterilized) is placed on top of the draped patient in the UCI bed, then the sterile plastic sheet is positioned above the metallic structure, forming a box-shaped enclosed device. Sterile towel clamps may be used to tighten up the box outer shape (figure 3a). The access ports on the COVID-Box are then created by cross-shape incisions made at the plastic sheets, two on each side, at the height of surgeon's arms (figure 3b). Another extra port should be created on the caudal part of the COVID-Box, which may be used for instrumentation. Intraoperative Steps Patient should be fully paralyzed and adequate sedated throughout the procedure, at the discretion of the intensivist. Minimizing aerosolization during the procedure itself is critical. The use of electrosurgical equipment should be limited to as minimum as possible but must not be used during tracheal incision. Also, ventilation should be paused prior to incision of the trachea (11). Insertion of tracheotomy tube should be quick, with the cuff immediately inflated and connected to a close circuit, in order to minimize open airway time. Postprocedure Steps, Waste Disposal and Decontamination The postprocedure waste disposal and decontamination of equipment need careful consideration to minimize contamination of the environment (12). Bioaerosols may remain viable in air for up to 3 hours (14), therefore removal of the COVID-Box apparatus should be done with caution. After tracheotomy is performed, we recommend leaving the COVID-Box placed on top of the patient for at least 3 hours, so it can be removed safely. Even though, extreme care during plastic sheet removal should be taken, with proper disposal afterwards. Drapes, suction tubes, electric scalpel and other disposable items are then removed and discard. The metallic frame of COVID-Box can be sanitized and sterilized for 8 future use. PPE should be worn in the postoperative setting according to the recommendations for enhanced droplet and airborne precautions.",
