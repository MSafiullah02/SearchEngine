If there is any doubt that in spite of halving the dose there are still signs of clozapine intoxication, completely stopping clozapine may be indicated.

In 1994, Bertilsson et al 1 described CYP1A2 as its major metabolic pathway. CYP1A2 pharmacology is highly relevant in clozapine dosing. Norclozapine is the main metabolite of clozapine and appears to be mainly eliminated by the kidney, since its conjugated metabolites are present in the urine and the serum free norclozapine is excreted by an unknown renal transporter that can be inhibited by gemfibrozil. With geriatric age, clozapine clearance from the body decreases; this is probably explained by the decrease in renal function and subsequent decrease in renal clearance of norclozapine and other metabolites eliminated in the urine.",

Male patients, then, tend to have serum concentration values that are approximately 0.86 that of females when using the same clozapine dose. 2 Co-medication with inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampicin increase clozapine metabolism and decrease clozapine levels. The most important inhibitors of clozapine metabolism are ciprofloxacin, oral contraceptives, fluvoxamine and caffeine in high doses.

Some of these clozapine ADRs, such as sedation, hypersalivation, constipation and seizures, are dose-related. It is probably more accurate to describe them as serum concentration-related. An expert guideline recommends for efficacy in schizophrenia trough steady-state clozapine concentrations of 350-600 ng/mL. 3 This indicates a narrow therapeutic index. The serum concentration of norclozapine does not contribute to antipsychotic efficacy since norclozapine has no antipsychotic activity.

            "text": "Clozapine dosing is not only influenced by geriatric age, smoking, gender and co-medication but ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian). In 1997, Asian researchers first described Chinese patients as having serum concentrations similar to those of Caucasians with only half the clozapine dose used in the US. 4 5 A meta-analytic review 2 showed that Chinese and other East Asians have lower clozapine clearance than Caucasians. The lower clozapine clearance, probably explained by lower CYP1A2 activity, appears to be present not only in Chinese patients but is also common to other Asians. 6 The FDA describes Asians as those people whose ancestral origins range geographically from Pakistan to Japan. 6 In Asians, to reach 350 ng/mL, a non-smoking female with average metabolism needs around 150 mg/ day and a male smoker 300 mg/day, requiring typical doses in Asians from 150 to 300 mg/day. 6 On the other hand, a non-smoking US Caucasian female with average clozapine metabolism needs around 300 mg/day while a US Caucasian male smoker needs 600 mg/day, requiring typical doses in the US from 300 to 600 mg/day. 6 To define clozapine poor metabolisers (PMs), it is necessary to stratify Asians versus non-Asians. Within the ethnic group, taking powerful clozapine inhibitors and/or being severely obese can be explained as being a phenotypic PM. In five Asian samples, around 7% of the patients (2%-13%) were phenotypic PMs, with no known cause, but four of the five studies were limited by not ruling out current inflammation, which can make a patient look temporarily like a clozapine PM. 7 Thus, it is possible that around 7% (2%-13%) of Asians may have unknown genetic mutations possibly at the CYP1A2 gene associated with being a clozapine PM. 7 Until there is a better definition of clozapine PMs, we recommend considering Asian clozapine PMs as those who reach concentrations of 350 ng/mL with clozapine doses <150 mg/day. A more precise definition, including smoking and gender stratification, is provided in a review article. 6 Asian female non-smokers who are PMs need a clozapine dose around 50 mg/day to reach 350 ng/ mL, while Asian male smokers who are PMs need a clozapine dose around 125 mg/day. 6 Until a better definition of clozapine PMs in non-Asians is established, we recommend considering non-Asian clozapine PMs as those who reach 350 ng/mL with clozapine doses <300 mg/day. 2 InflAmmAtIon cAn IncreAse clozApIne levels The US package insert for theophylline, a drug metabolised by CYP1A2, indicates that upper respiratory infections with fever increase serum theophylline concentrations. The release of cytokines during the infection decreases the activity and/or expression of CYP1A2. More relevant for clinicians, experts on theophylline 8 recommended that the theophylline dose should be approximately halved to avoid intoxication during these infections. Therefore, the first author reduced the clozapine dose by half 8 when he first diagnosed a clozapine intoxication during an upper respiratory infection with fever in one of his patients. The later arrival of the clozapine serum concentration level verified his diagnosis of clozapine intoxication. 8 In 2004, based on this case 9 and the available literature, he proposed that during severe inflammations/infections, including pneumonia, the clozapine dose should be halved until clozapine levels are available to better personalise clozapine dosing. 9 Through 2016, there are 40 published cases of clozapine elevation during infections. 10 There are also published clozapine intoxications during severe inflammation without infection. 11 More recently, in a Beijing hospital, three cases of clozapine intoxication we identified included ones with pneumonia, 12 influenza 11 and dermatitis in the absence of infection. 11 In these three Chinese patients severe infections were associated with roughly double the serum concentrations, 11 12 while the effects in relation to dermatitis depended more on its severity. A doubling of the concentration was only observed when there was an elevation of the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and widespread effect on the skin all over the body. 11 In a recent retrospective review of 131 clozapine inpatients at Beijing Anding Hospital, we found 18 episodes of infections/ inflammations in 16 patients. At the total sample level, these episodes: (1) extended for 2% (482/24 789) of clozapine days and (2) contaminated 3% (46/1384) of trough steady-state serum concentrations of clozapine. At the individual level, we found: (1) no clinically relevant effects on the serum clozapine concentrations in the 11% of infection episodes which presented with no leukocytosis or CRP elevations; (2) halving the clozapine dose would be advisable in 61% of the infection episodes; and (3) reducing the clozapine dose to one-third would be advisable in 28% of infection episodes. 13 Therefore, based on the US 8 14 and Chinese experiences [11] [12] [13] as well as on the literature, 10 we proposed that clinicians need to be very alert regarding clozapine patients' risk of clozapine intoxications during any kind of systemic inflammation associated with fever and/or CRP elevations. Until better data is available, based on our experience in the US and China, we have developed three sets of recommendations regarding infection, based on timeframe: (1) prevention; (2) during the infection; and (3) after the infection. 13 For prevention, we recommend that psychiatrists using clozapine should educate their outpatients and families to be attentive to signs or symptoms of infection/inflammation or fever and to contact them immediately to prevent clozapine intoxications. Moreover, a careful clinician, after reaching a stable maintenance clozapine dose, should go ahead and measure two or three trough and steady-state serum clozapine concentrations. By calculating the mean concentration and correcting by the clozapine dose, 2 the clinician can establish a baseline for clozapine metabolism in that patient and the lowest clozapine dose providing a therapeutic serum concentration. In the unfortunate event that the patient develops a systemic infection or inflammation, this baseline clozapine metabolism can be compared with the decreased metabolism during the inflammation.",

            "text": "clozApIne cAn cAuse InflAmmAtIon Clozapine can also cause inflammation, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. Most cases of clozapine-induced inflammation occur during titration and the most typical manifestations are CRP elevations, fever and/or myocarditis. 15 Other rarer forms have been described and include serositis, pneumonitis/alveolitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, nephritis, colitis and dermatological disorders. 15 Australia appears to have almost 10-100 times more clozapine-induced myocarditis than European countries. Drug agencies from various countries send their data to a WHO database called VigiBase. 16 In July 2019, there were 3048 reports of myocarditis associated with clozapine, which resulted in 6% lethality (170 fatal outcomes). Australia provided >1500 of those reports. Most individual countries from continental Europe provided <30 reports. In the view of Australian experts, 17 a 3% incidence rate of clozapine-induced myocarditis in Australia is explained solely by their intensive cardiac monitoring during titration, which is not practiced in other countries. Psychiatrists in continental Europe, on the other hand, titrate their patients slowly and rarely diagnose clozapine-induced myocarditis. In a real-world study with 3262 clozapine patients from the Danish registry, Rohde et al 18 found a 0.03% incidence of myocarditis within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on a 3% incidence of myocarditis according to Australian data and a 6% death rate due to lack of cardiac monitoring, six deaths (3% multiplied by 6% is 0.18% and 0.18% of 3262 is six deaths) were expected in that Danish study, but no myocarditis deaths were identified within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. 18 To understand the paradox of clozapine myocarditis, one needs to remember that inflammation decreases clozapine metabolism and then realise that clozapine can also cause inflammation. The history of lamotrigine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome provides further understanding. 19 Lamotrigine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome was associated with rapid dose escalation and/ or normal titration in patients taking an inhibitor, such as valproic acid. The first sign that the titration is too fast for that patient is usually a skin rash. If the escalation continues, autoantibodies develop, leading to fullblown Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Therefore, after the first approval, the pharmaceutical company had to reformulate the lamotrigine titration by halving the dose during co-prescription of valproic acid. Similarly, we propose that, first, a clozapine titration that is too fast leads to CRP elevations and/or fever; second, cytokine release decreases clozapine metabolism and this causes a positive feedback mechanism; Third, if the clozapine titration continues, the inflammation evolves into myocarditis, probably with the development of auto-antibodies.",

In two of the five patients clozapine levels were available and they were compatible with a decrease in clozapine clearance. 20 Following this model, clozapineinduced myocarditis can be prevented by using slow, personalised titration: (1) with further slowing for Asians treated by Western psychiatrists, including Australians, who were trained to use Caucasian-level titration in all their patients; (2) considering reversible cases of clozapine PM status by stopping the co-prescription of inhibitors, such as valproic acid and oral contraceptives, and requiring normal CRP before starting clozapine; and (3) considering extremely slow titration for cases of clozapine PMs in which the cause cannot be removed: extreme obesity or an absolutely needed co-prescribed inhibitor.

The mechanism is not well understood but it is believed that, in these patients, antibodies are developed against the neutrophils. The peak incidence occurs at 1 month of exposure and declines to negligible levels after 1 year of treatment. 21 A recent meta-analysis provided a prevalence of agranulocytosis of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.3% to 0.6%); deaths caused by agranulocytosis were 0.05% (CI: 0.03% to 0.09%). 22 This widespread awareness by clinicians is reflected in the almost 35 000 reports of neutropenia in VigiBase with the number of fatal outcomes only in the 500s (2% relative lethality). 16 More importantly, clinicians may not be aware that even in the absence of neutropenia, clozapine has been associated with a possible increased infection risk. Landry et al, 23 based on case reports, proposed that clozapine may increase the risk of tuberculosis and, based on a chart review in a Canadian hospital, may be associated with increased use of antibiotics. Large studies in clozapine patients using the registries of Taiwan 24 and Denmark 25 verified an increased risk of tuberculosis with an adjusted risk ratio of 1.63 (95% CI: 1.10 to 2.40; p = 0.014) 24 and increased antibiotic use with a relative risk of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.26 to 1.61, p<0.001). 25 In a British case-control study, a higher proportion of the clozapine-treated group reported taking more than five courses of antibiotics in the preceding year, 5.3% (5/123) vs 1% (1/111) in controls taking other antipsychotics, and this was associated with an increased percentage of patients with low values for all immunoglobulins. 26 In an vitro study, clozapine increased the production of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. 27 Regarding possible increased infection risk in the absence of agranulocytosis, we only recommend that clinicians tell clozapine patients to avoid close contact with contagious people.",

Then Kuo et al, 28 using the Taiwanese registry, demonstrated that clozapine may be the antipsychotic most closely associated with pneumonia. As a matter of fact, compared with other antipsychotics, clozapine General Psychiatry may be associated with a greater number of pneumonia cases and greater mortality. 16 More importantly, clinicians need to be aware that pneumonia may be among the greatest causes of mortality in clozapine patients. VigiBase had >6000 reports of broadly-defined pneumonia in clozapine patients with >2000 lethal outcomes. To get an accurate perspective, clinicians need to be aware that the broad definitions of agranulocytosis or myocarditis were associated with lethal outcomes in the 500s. 16 Before describing which known mechanism can explain the strong association between clozapine and pneumonia, we have to acknowledge that in countries other than China clozapine is mainly used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Thus, in countries other than China, the association between clozapine and pneumonia may be partly explained by the greater severity of illness in clozapine patients, who are frequently the most treatment-refractory patients with relatively high rates of smoking. Therefore, the contributing effects of the severity level of mental illness on pneumonia needs to be further explored by future studies in clozapine patients. On the other hand, clozapine has specific effects independent of the greater severity of illness in the clozapine patients, since using mirror-image design in the Danish registry,Rhode et al. 29 Rhode et al 29 found that clozapine gave the largest absolute increase in pneumonia risk although it did not reach significance, probably due to the relatively small sample size. In the year before clozapine, there were 1.22% (23/1872) patients with pneumonia and in the first year 1.87% (35/1872). This is an increase of 0.64% (12/1872) (p=0.10).",

            "text": "Clozapine, as with any other antipsychotic, can interfere with swallowing, increasing the potential for aspiration. 27 The potential for aspiration and aspiration pneumonia during antipsychotic treatment may be further increased by sedation and hypersalivation. 27 As clozapine is more prone to cause sedation and hypersalivation than other antipsychotics, 27 it is not surprising that clozapine may be more strongly associated with aspiration pneumonia. Assuming that clozapine is associated with immunological abnormalities, this may also explain an increased risk for other types of pneumonia not associated with aspiration. Rarely, other severe clozapine ADRs, such as severe constipation complicated with ileus, or myocarditis, can be complicated by pneumonia. Once pneumonia develops, clozapine co-prescription may be particularly lethal and worse than other antipsychotics. Severe inflammation during pneumonia releases cytokines that inhibit CYP1A2 expression and/or activity and increase serum clozapine concentrations, further increasing the risk of concentration-related ADRs including hypersalivation, sedation, aspiration or even arrhythmia, creating very dangerous positive feedback. 16 Our three sets of recommendations for infections in clozapine patients apply to the most important infection, pneumonia. The general preventive measures related to infection apply, including patient/family education and use of the lowest possible dosage providing efficacious response. Specific preventive measures for aspiration pneumonia are close monitoring of sedation and hypersalivation. Clozapine administration should be moved around to the most convenient times in order to increase adherence and decrease these ADRs; treat hypersalivation, preferably with local antimuscarinic treatments which may have less risk of increasing the risk of constipation than oral anticholinergic drugs, such as benztropine, or biperiden. Discontinuation of other co-medications associated with sedation and/or pneumonia risk should be considered. As benzodiazepines are associated with sedation, swallowing disturbances and pneumonia, clinicians may need to consider decreasing or discontinuing them to decrease the aspiration pneumonia risk. Although there is no data, it may not be unreasonable to give pneumonia vaccines to clozapine patients to decrease risk of pneumonia not associated with aspiration, but it cannot be ruled out that vaccines may not be as effective in clozapine patients due to clozapine effects on immunological mechanisms.",
