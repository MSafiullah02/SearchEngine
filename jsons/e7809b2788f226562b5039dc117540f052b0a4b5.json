The animals were gavage treated 5 d per week with up to 1000 ng of PCB126 per kilogram of body weight per day or up to 100 ng of TCDD per kilogram of body weight per day for up to 2 yr. The control animals received only a corn oil/acetone vehicle (99:1 mixture). The corresponding stop-study groups received the highest doses for 31 wk and then received only the vehicle for the remainder of the study. After a full necropsy of all animals, a complete set of tissues was examined microscopically. Administration of each compound was associated with treatment-related increases in the incidences of degenerative cardiovascular lesions. Cardiomyopathy and chronic active arteritis increased in a dose-related manner in all groups treated with PCB126 or with TCDD. Increased incidences were also observed in the stop-study groups, indicating that a shorter term exposure may produce some effects. The average severity of cardiomyopathy was minimal or slightly greater in all dose groups, including the controls. Chronic active arteritis occurred primarily in the mesentery and pancreas, although the rectum, liver, heart, ovary, uterus, and glandular stomach in the PCB126 study and the liver and ovary in the TCDD study were affected in a few of the dosed animals. The authors' investigations indicate that the rat cardiovascular system is a target for dioxin toxicity, which increases the incidence of spontaneous cardiomyopathy and arteritis.",

Animal studies indicate that exposure to dioxins can produce effects on the cardiovascular system. For example, Kociba et al. (3) report that rats treated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have hemorrhages in the brain and spinal cord, an increase above background levels in the incidence of mesenteric/thoracic periarteritis accompanied by thrombosis, and, in females only, an increase above background levels in the incidence of myocardial degeneration. Brewster et al. (4) note that macrophage-like structures in the intima and media, considered to be preatherosclerotic lesions, occurred in TCDD-treated rabbits. Dioxin treatment of C57Bl/6J mice produces an elevated mean tail-cuff blood pressure and an increase in the urinary excretion of vasoactive eicosanoids, and exposure of Apoe (-/-) mice to dioxins causes a trend toward an earlier onset and greater severity of atherosclerotic lesions (5). Riecke et al. (6) note diffuse myocardial interstitial collagen deposition in marmosets, which they suggest is mediated through transforming growth factor b-1.",

Exposure of zebrafish embryos to TCDD during early development results in reduced blood flow in the mesencephalic vein, which may be related to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation, induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP1A), and oxidative stress (7) . Exposure of chick embryos to TCDD is associated with an increase in the normally occurring level of apoptosis in the heart, a decreased myocyte proliferation with a thinner ventricular wall, and a reduction in coronary artery development, which is demonstrated by decreased coronary artery size and number. The decrease in coronary artery development may be a result of the decreased myocyte proliferation and thinner ventricular wall, which, in turn, may be influenced by increased apoptosis (8) .",

However, lung vas-culitis was observed in AHR-deficient mice when a high dose of TCDD was applied (2000 \u00b5g/kg) but not when lower doses were used (200 \u00b5g/kg). These observations suggest a pathway leading to toxicity that is unrelated to AHR when high doses are used (10) . No TCDD-related lesions were observed in other tissues, including the heart, in the AHR-deficient mice. Another suggested mechanism for cardiovascular pathology is a reduction in local circulation involving CYP1A induction associated with the release of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, resulting in increased vascular permeability (7) .",

The same study design was used for both studies and included interim evaluation groups, 2-yr study groups, and a single stop-study group that received the highest dose of chemical. The stop-study group was added to (1) investigate the potential reversibility of various pathological effects induced by these compounds on withdrawal of the treatment and (2) attempt to distinguish between genotoxic and nongenotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis (11) . Interim valuations were conducted at 14 wk, 31 wk, and 53 wk; 10 animals per group were evaluated at 14 wk and at 31 wk; and 8 animals per group were evaluated at 53 wk.

In the treated and control rats, the microscopic appearance of cardiomyopathy, which is a common spontaneous change in rats, was typical of the appearance that has been described for this change (16) . Cardiomyopathy was characterized by a slight alteration consisting of multiple foci of myocardial degeneration scattered within the ventricular walls, most commonly the left ventricle and the interventricular septum. The earliest changes, seen in only a few animals in these studies, consisted of small foci of myocardial fiber necrosis, characterized by deeply eosinophilic myocardial fibers with pyknotic nuclei and diffusely infiltrated with lymphocytes and macrophages and an occasional neutrophil. As lesion development progressed, the necrotic myocardial fibers were replaced by proliferating interstitial connective tissue cells producing several small, irregular, lightly eosinophilic areas that contained numerous connective tissue nuclei lying between myocardial fibers. In addition, areas of accumulation of small to moderate amounts of lightly basophilic, homogeneous material-presumably ground substance-that lay between and separated adjacent myocardial fibers were also commonly seen. This was the stage of lesion development that was observed most prevalently in these studies. In a few animals, lesion development progressed even further, producing a somewhat more severe change that consisted of moderate-sized foci of complete replacement of myocardial fibers by connective tissue. Lesion severity was graded according to the amount of myocardium affected. In most animals, because the amount of affected myocardium was relatively small, the severity of cardiomyopathy was graded as minimal.",

As the lesions progressed, the necrosis of the vessel wall resolved and was replaced by varying degrees of medial thickening, which, in some cases -primarily in large arteries-resulted in a medial thickness that was several times greater than that seen in the normal wall. The thickened media generally contained increased numbers of nuclei arranged in a somewhat disordered pattern, and small amounts of homogeneous, lightly basophilic material, presumably ground substance, were present between smooth muscle fibers. The lumina of larger arteries were often dilated. The thickening of the arterial wall, together with the luminal dilatation seen in the larger arteries, led to an overall increase in the size of the artery, which accounted for the grossly observed lesions. Irregular focal remnants of the necrotic media were often seen within the thickened walls of large arteries, indicating that fibrinoid necrosis was resolved through replacement by medial proliferation. Some degree of adventitial proliferation, as well as inflammatory cell infiltrate within the adventitia, was still present.

Thus, both chemicals increased the incidences of cardiomyopathy without increasing the average severities. That none of the interim evaluation animals, including those evaluated at 53 wk, was observed to have cardiomyopathy indicates that the lesions developed later in life. Cardiomyopathy occurred in the stopstudy groups that received the high dose of compound for 31 wk and vehicle thereafter until study termination at 2 yr. However, at 2 yr, the incidences in the stop-study groups were greater than those in the respective control groups-indicating a chemical-related effect-but less than those in the highdose groups that had received chemical for 2 yr. These findings suggest that a shorter term exposure to the compounds can result in a higher incidence of cardiomyopathy than in controls. Furthermore, longer exposure times and higher doses of chemical can lead to the occurrence of cardiomyopathy in an even greater number of animals. Because myocardial degeneration of cardiomyopathy heals by fibrosis and leaves a permanent lesion, microscopic examination should have revealed whether cardiomyopathy had ever been present in the stop-study animals, even if lesion development had ceased after compound administration was discontinued. Thus, the lack of any lesions in a given stop-study animal indicates that cardiomyopathy was never present in that animal. The lower incidence in the stop-study groups apparently occurred because fewer animals developed cardiomyopathy. In a 2-yr study in which SD rats were administered up to 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/d of TCDD in the feed, Kociba et al. (3) also reported an increase of myocardial degenerative change above background levels in females only, which suggests a possible sexual predisposition.

This finding may suggest that exposure to the chemicals increased the occurrence of the spontaneous change. According to Greaves (17) , however, the presence of fibrosis is a common end-stage finding with myocardial degeneration and results from different etiologies and pathogeneses (i.e., initial, direct, chemically induced insult to the myocardium; exaggeration of spontaneous disease after treatment-related increase in circulatory demand; or other chemically induced changes).

Its cause in the rat is unknown, but age of onset and severity are affected by diet, environment, and stress (16) . The caloric and protein content of the diet, having a positive association with the development of cardiomyopathy, and fiber content, displaying a negative association, have been reported to influence the severity of spontaneous cardiomyopathy (18, 19) . In the SD rat, spontaneous cardiomyopathy is more common in males (20, 21) , in which it can appear as early as 3-4 mo of age. Sites of predilection include the myocardium of the apex, the region below the fibrous rings, the papillary muscles, and the free wall of the left ventricle. The changes are focal or diffuse, consisting of progressive mononuclear cell infiltration, fibrosis, myofiber degeneration/necrosis, and atrophy (21) . Early lesions of spontaneous cardiomyopathy are focal to multifocal and tend to enlarge and become more extensive as they increase in severity. In general, myocardial lesions resulting from anoxia tend to be focal, whereas toxic lesions are usually generalized. Cardiomyopathy may, therefore, be secondary to focal anoxia, possibly resulting from slight vascular changes. In these studies, however, no vascular lesions were observed in the hearts affected with cardiomyopathy, which suggests that any vascular changes must be functional rather than pathological. Treatment of rats with catecholamines, which are vasoactive compounds, can result in multifocal myocardial necrosis (16) . TCDD, through the activation of AHR, may be able to influence blood pressure in mice through the production of vasoactive eicosanoids (5). This suggestion introduces the possibility that vasoactive effects of the test compounds affected the occurrence of cardiomyopathy; however, information is lacking concerning potential vasoactive effects of dioxin compounds in rats.",

After cessation of treatment, therefore, the chemical exhibits a slow decrease in body burdens over the remainder of the study to low levels that are equivalent to those seen with lower dose exposure (data not shown). Thus, exposure per se does not stop; rather, it persists after cessation of daily dosing. By simply considering the total weekly averaged exposure over the course of the study, one sees that the stop group has a higher total of administered dose than a lowdose treated group in which increases in cardiomyopathy were observed (10 ng/kg/d). For example, dosing at 100 ng/kg/d for 5 d a week for 31 wk, averaged over 104 wk, yields an average of 149 ng/kg/wk or 21 ng/kg/d. The greater incidences of cardiomyopathy in the stop-study groups may, therefore, indicate that a time-integrated dose metric (such as total area under the curve of exposure) may be a better measure of dose for evaluating cardiomyopathy. Clearly, though, these data indicate that cardiomyopathy does not require continuous high-dose levels over the entire course of the study; rather, early exposure can lead to effects later. Alternatively, chance occurrence unrelated to treatment may have played a role, but this possibility seems unlikely, as the incidences in both stop-study groups exceeded those in both control groups and were similar to those seen in treated groups. Thus, at present, the mechanism by which TCDD and PCB126 increased the incidences of cardiomyopathy remains undetermined and requires elucidation.",

These data suggest that the potency of PCB126 for inducing cardiomyopathy may be less than that predicted by the current WHO TEF of 0.1. However, a formal modeling of the appropriateness of WHO TEFs and the additivity of relative potency factors for nonneoplastic changes (including cardiomyopathy) and neoplastic changes observed in these and other studies will be presented elsewhere. Arteritis occurred in one or more animals in each of the treated groups, including the stop-study groups, but not in the controls. The incidences were higher in the PCB126-treated animals than in the TCDDtreated animals, except for the stop-study groups, in which the incidence was greater in the TCDD study. The incidences increased with increasing doses, but the average severity, which generally fell between mild to moderate, was similar across dose groups. That arteritis was not observed in any of the interim evaluation animals indicates that, like cardiomyopathy, it developed later in life. Arteritis was observed in a small number of animals in the stop-study groups that received the high dose of compound for 31 wk and vehicle thereafter until study termination at 2 yr. The incidences were fewer than those of the highdose groups that received the chemical for 2 yr and were higher in the TCDD group than in the PCB126 stop-study group, in which only a single animal was affected. These findings suggest that, as in cardiomyopathy, shorter term exposure to the chemical may predispose the animal to the development of arteritis, but longer exposure times and higher doses of the chemical may lead to the occurrence of arteritis in a greater number of animals. Arteritis affected primarily the mesenteric and pancreatic arteries, occasionally the arteries in other abdominal organs, and, in one animal, the heart. In their 2-yr study of TCDD, Kociba et al. (3) also reported an increase above background levels in mesenteric and thoracic periarteritis, with accompanying changes, including thrombosis, in males and females. In the present studies, arteritis in the heart, which occurred in one stop-study animal from the PCB126 study, was its only occurrence in an extra-abdominal location. That thrombosis was occasionally observed in affected arteries is in agreement with the findings of Kociba et al. (3) .",

The mesenteric and pancreatic arteries have been reported to be especially susceptible to the effects of vasodilators (28, 29) , possibly resulting from a lack of anatomic supporting structures for these vessels and/or the presence of specific receptors for the vasodilator in the vessel wall (27, 30, 31) . A recent study in F344/N rats of theophylline, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor that produces excessive vasodilation, resulted in periarteritis of the mesenteric and pancreatic arteries that appeared morphologically similar to the arteritis in the present studies (26) . This finding suggests the possibility that the arteritis observed in our investigation was caused by the vasoactive effects of the compounds on the affected arteries, although the potential vasoactive effects of these compounds in rats are unknown.
