Denison R eview articles on the topic of pharyngitis usually focus on the importance of not missing the diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections. This emphasis derives from the treatability of these infections, including the acute and subacute complications of ifaitially untreated GABHS infections. In this context the viral pharyngytides are addressed only peripherally, to round out a differential diagnosis and to point out the classic presentations of pharyngitis caused by herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and enteroviruses so that an unnecessary course of antibiotics can be avoided. However, the viral pharyngities have unique issues of transmission, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, morbidity, and treatment that make them well worth discussing as an independent group.",

It can replicate in a number of cell lines, but in humans it appears to be tropic primarily for cells of B lymphocyte lineage. EBV can cause transformation of 13 cells, resulting in its welbknown association with Burkitt's lymphomaJ 3 EBV appears to be transmitted rather inefficiently, with transmission occurring primarily\" by intimate contact. The moniker of the \"kissing disease\" is a result of rather prolonged shedding of EBV in upper respiratory secretions after EBV infection and in asymptomatic adults, as well as the close contact required for effective transmission. EBV can be found in the blood and other body fluids, especially in immunocompromised patients, but blood-borne transmission is unusual under normal circumstances. 14 The pathogenesis of EBV infection involving pharyngitis has not been well described. Since ent.ry is via the mouth and oropharynx, it might be assumed that local replication in tonsillar B cells initiates infection, followed by spread to regional lymph nodes, viremia, B cell proliferation, and spread to distal sites. In fact, this appears to be the case. There is a persistent oropharyngeal infection with excretion for sometimes prolonged periods in more than 85% of patients with IM. 15 B lymphocytes infected in the oropharynx undergo polyclonal transformation and spread to distal sites, localizing primarily in the lymphoid organs. Early in the infection, a significant percentage of circulating B cells are infected (between 5% and 20%), but this rapidly declines during the second week of infection (to fewer than 2%) as infected cells are cleared. 13 Clinical mononucleosis is probably a manifestation of the immune response to the infected B cells. By the time clinical illness manifests, few circulating Bcells are EBV-positive; the reactive lymphocytosis consists primarily ofT cells, principally of the cytotoxic T cell category.I6",

It has been thought that EBV infection usually is asymptomatic in this age group, and that classic \"adult type\" infectious mononucleosis rarely occurs. But Sumaya and Ench 17 have demonstrated that illness consistent with clinical IM may not be as uncommon as previously thought. 17 The variation in clinical presentation with younger age and the decreased heterophile antibody response may have been responsible for this underestimation of EBV mono in young children. Children less than 4 years old may have a similar incidence of exudative tonsillopharyngitis but more rashes, neutropenia, and hepatosplenomegaly than do older children and adults. In relation to the oropharynx, recurrent tonsillopharyngitis may be associated with EBV infection in very young children.

The child less than 4 years old is less likely to have absolute lymphocytosis, with the likelihood decreasing as age decreases. The diagnosis had been more difficult in younger children because tests to identify heterophile antibodies are positive less often in children under age 6, but the advent of specific EBV serologies has enabled the diagnosis of EBV infection in any aged child. In a child over age 6, the diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty with tests for heterophile antibodies, such as the Mono-Spot. This is a qualitative test based on the Paul-Bunell-Davidson quantitative heterophile tests. The \"rapid slide tests\" use horse erythrocytes, which are agglutinated in the presence ofheterophile antibodies. In fact, these qualitative tests appear to be as good (approximately 80%) as quantitative heterophile tests with horse erythrocytes in detecting EBV in children as young as 4 years old. 18 At ages less than 4, the poor sensitivity of rapid slide tests probably results from lower levels ofheterophile antibodies, because quantitative assays also detect fewer cases of confirmed EBV infection. Thus, in the case of suspected EBV in a child less than 4 years old, specific serologies are more likely to be useful. Specifically, the detection of IgM antibodies against the viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgM) is as useful in young children and infants as in older children and adults. It may be important to make sure that VCA-IgM can be quantitated at titers of less than 160, because they may be lower (< 40) and more short lived (2 to 4 weeks) than in adults. TM",

This is a potentially catastrophic imitator of EBV mononucleosis but also has been reported as a complication of EBV infection. Lemierre's disease was first described in 1936 and consists of fever, dysphagia, severe exudative pharyngitis, and swelling over the sternocleidomastoid in an adolescent or young adult. 23 The symptoms and duration may mimic exactly the exudative pharyngitis, fetor oris, fever, and lymphadenopathy of EBV. Lemierre's disease, however, is caused by _Fusobacleriurn necrophorum, a gram-negative anaerobe which is a frequent, normal inhabitant of the oral cavity. The severe pharyngitis of Lemierre's disease is a direct invasion by\" the organism, and the swelling over the sternocleidomastoid is .septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. It is important to quickly differentiate this syndrome from EBV IM because F necrophorum can rapidly and destructively disseminate to bones, central nervous system (CNS), lungs, liver, and kidneys, resulting in CNS and lung abscesses, multifocal osteomyelitis, and overwhelming sepsis. [24] [25] [26] Thus, we return to the importance of the other fairly consistent features ofEBV IM such as splenomegaly, lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and heterophile positivity. In the absence of these features, one should be suspicious of an EBV diagnosis. Even with confirmed EBV disease, the presence of severe continued exudative tonsillitis, or new findings such as shortness of breath or joint pain, should bring Lemierre's disease to mind.

Not surprisingly, acquisition of enteroviruses is most common in young children who have more promiscuously bad hygiene than do adults and who transmit enteroviruses via feces, skin, and fingers-to-mouth. Initial replication occurs to relatively high levels in the oropharynx and proximal gastroin-testinal tract within the first 1 to 3 days. This replication is followed by primary viremia with spread to other regions of the reticuloendothelial system and then by more replication over the next 3 days, with subsequent viremia and dissemination. Oropharyngeal manifestations of enterovirus infection appear to be a result ofviremia spread back to the oropharynx, rather than of continued replication in situ with local responses. This conclusion is predicated on the lack of prodrome and the appearance of pharyngeal lesions at the same time as the onset of fever and other manifestations ofenterovirus disease, such as rash or hepatitis. Enteroviral illnesses usually last from 3 to 6 days, with malaise and relatively l~igh fever, which rapidly resolves, leaving no sequelae.",

Oral lesions appear 1 to 2 days later, followed by other skin lesions. Oral lesions are more common than hand and foot lesions, while hand lesions are more common than those on the feet. Oral lesions are present in 90% to 100% of young children with Coxsackie virus A16 infection; they present as small (4 to 8 ram) ulcerated lesions principally on the buccal mucosa and posterior tongue, although the palate, uvula, and anterior tonsillar pillars are involved about 40% of the time. 3~ Because the exanthem is not always present, and because exanthem becomes increasingly uncommon with older children and adults, the oropharyngeal lesions of HFlVl frequently are misdiagnosed as apthous ulcers or herpes simplex stomatitis. There is little practical consequence to this mistaken identity, however, because HFM is a self-limited illness which clears within 4 to 6 days.

            "text": "Herpangina refers to small papular, papnlovesicular, or ulcerated lesions of the oropharynx in association with other systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and anorexia. Herpangina is caused primarily by Coxsackie A and B viruses, and much less frequently by echo and other enteroviruses. In contrast to HFM, herpangina is caused by a wider variety of viruses. In a study of 538Japanese patients, Coxsackie A 1-10, 16, 22 and Coxsackie B 1-5 comprised 75% and 12%, respectively, of the responsible agents. 33 Transmission is thought to be primarily by the fecaloral route, although at least one prospective volunteer study 34 and one retrospective review of herpangina suggest that airborne transmission may be more common than previously thought. 33 As with HFM, the illness is heralded by acute onset of fever, sore throat, and anorexia, although the acuity and severity of these symptoms is variable. The lesions of herpangina may appear anytime within the first 48 hours after the onset of nonspecific symptoms. These lesions are characterized as 1 or more discrete papular lesions that progress to vesicles, which subsequently become small (1 to 2 mm) ulcers that may enlarge to 3 to 4 mm. The lesions are surrounded by a zone of erythema and, in contrast to HFM, are more common on the tonsillar pillars, palate, uvula, and posterior pharyngeal wall but also may be present on the posterior tongue and buccal mucosa. The small size of the lesions and posterior location is characteristic of herpangina. As with HFM, herpangina usually resolves in 3 to 6 days without complications. 35 No general laboratory tests are useful in diagnosing herpangina. Culture of the oropharynx or rectal swabs may yield an organism if it is caused by Coxsaekie B viruses or echoviruses. But because the majority of cases of herpangina are caused by Coxsackie A viruses, suckling mouse inoculation would be required for their diagnosis. This inoculation might be warranted in the case of an epidemic or herpangina with significant other complications. 29",

HSV is transmitted by virus= in secretions, principally saliva, and has a strong predilection for infecting mucosal surfaces and other tissues of ectodermal origin. However, only a very small percentage of children seropositive for HSV-1 have any history consistent with oral infection, specifically gingivostomatitis. An exception is the high percentage (31%) of seropositive Navajo children reported to have a history of gingivostomatitis. 37 This suggests that other factors may be critical in the progression from infection to clinically apparent gingivostomatitis. Herpes gingivostomatitis is seen primarily in children between 10 months and 3 years old . 36, 38 Transmission of HSV may occur by direct contact, by transmission on fingers, or by transmission on other objects, although this is less common. Primary oropharyngeal infection appears to remain localized, with no viremia detected by culture during clinical disease in one study. 39 However, this study did not use hybridization or polymerase chain reaction, and it measured virus at only one time point, so it is still possible that low level viremia may occur at some point during infection. The incubation period of the virus is short (1 to 3 days), and illness begins with fever and irritability, followed by the appearance of vesicular lesions on the lips, buccal surfaces, tongue, and gingivae. The vesicular lesions may progress rapidly (over a few hours) to pustules and ruptured vesicles, leaving shallow, erythematous, painful ulcers. The lesions may bleed on contact, and the gums may be swollen and tender. Lesions often are noted around the nares, cheeks, lips, and chin, and there may be associated significant tender cervical adenopathy. Beginning with the prodromal period, children with significant involvement may drool, appear in great distress, and refuse to eat or drink fluids. The latter complications are most often the reason for hospitalization of these children. The normal course is continued appearance and evolution of lesions for up to 5 days, followed by complete resolution over I to 2 weeks without scarring. pharynx, with significant pain. Respiratory syncytral viruses and parainfluenza viruses may cause erythematous pharyngitis, but this is usually mild and is overshadowed by the other respiratory components of these illnesses. Interestingly, reoviruses may have ewthematous pharyngitis as part of their clinical presentation, which is primarily gastroenteritis. The enanthem of measles has no characteristic pharyngeal lesions, but again is primarily erythema; the Koplik's spots on the buccal mucosae are the distinguishing characteristic of the oral pathology. Thus, these agents present primarily as erythematous pharyngitis and their diagnosis is dependent on recognizing other aspects of the illness and on laboratory tests.",
