            "text": "Over the history of biomolecular NMR, stable isotope labeling methods have always played key roles in providing the foundation for protein structural investigations. The range of biomolecular NMR studies has expanded along with the development of protein isotope labeling methods [1\u20135]. Numerous isotope labeling schemes are now available for NMR studies. The conventional [U-13C,15N] labeling approach, which is widely employed in NMR investigations of proteins smaller than 25 kDa, allows the application of heteronuclear multidimensional experiments to resolve highly overlapped proton NMR signals from each other, by correlating the hetero-nuclei chemical shifts of the attached 15N and/or 13C signals [6, 7]. As a result, it is now almost routine work to determine the three-dimensional structures of small proteins using [U-13C,15N] samples, which can readily be prepared by growing E. coli cells harboring the targeted protein genes in minimal medium containing [13C]-glucose and/or [15N]-ammonium salt as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. However, the largest size amenable to NMR structure determination using uniformly [U-13C,15N] proteins is around 25 kDa, due to the excessive signal overlapping and line broadening. To address the size problem, protein deuteration to improve the spectral quality has been explored. The substitution of 1H to 2H mitigates the unwanted dipolar and scalar couplings in proteins [8]. In concert with transverse relaxation spectroscopy (TROSY), the size limitation for NMR investigations has been somewhat relieved [9]. In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the further developments along this direction since the turn of the century, i.e., selective methyl labeling, stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL), and other NMR methods using advanced site-specific isotope labeling technologies.",

In addition, the NMR signal intensity of a methyl group is very strong, due to the high proton density and fast rotation around the methyl carbon axis. Therefore, methyl groups are valuable probes in NMR studies of the structures and dynamics of large proteins. During the past two decades, methyl-specific isotope labeling techniques on perdeuterated proteins have been progressing, and their combination with methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (methyl TROSY) [10] has allowed structural and dynamic information to be obtained for protein particles as large as 1 MDa [11].",

            "text": "For producing methyl-specific-labeled proteins in the conventional E. coli protein expression system, isotope-labeled amino acid precursors are commonly used. Among them, \u03b1-ketobutyrate and \u03b1-ketoisovalerate are well-established precursors for the specific isotope labeling of the Ile \u03b41, Leu \u03b41/\u03b42, and Val \u03b31/\u03b32 methyl groups in proteins, respectively [12, 13]. A variety of isotope-labeled \u03b1-keto acids and their methyl isotopomers (i.e.,\n13CH3, 13CH2D, and 13CHD2) have been developed [14] and are commercially available at affordable prices. Therefore, these precursors are widely used in various NMR experiments. In the case of using \u03b1-ketoisovalerate, in which the \u03b31 or \u03b32-methyl is alternatively labeled with 13CH3 and 12CD3 (Fig. 1a), all inter-residue methyl-methyl NOEs for Leu and Val residues can be observed, because of the alternative methyl labeling scheme. In protein dynamics studies, 13CH2D or 13CHD2 isotopomers might be useful for obtaining 2H or 1H relaxation information for the methyl groups [15, 16]. The sequence-specific assignment for Ile \u03b41, Leu \u03b41/\u03b42, and Val \u03b31/\u03b32 methyl signals can also be achieved by using COSY-based HN-detected and methyl-detected \u201cout-and-back\u201d experiments [17, 18]. For larger proteins, such as the 468 kDa PhTET2 complex, a systematic site-directed mutagenesis method was used for the methyl signal assignment [19]. However, these approaches alone cannot establish the stereospecific assignments for Leu \u03b41/\u03b42 and Val \u03b31/\u03b32 methyl groups. For the stereospecific assignment of these prochiral methyl groups, additional experiments, such as biosynthetic fractional 13C labeling or selective labeling with 13C-\u201cblock\u201d-labeled Leu and Val, are required [5, 20]. There are some other limitations of \u03b1-keto acid precursors for Ile, Leu, and Val methyl labeling. For example, \u03b1-ketobutyrate cannot be applied for labeling the \u03b32 methyl group of Ile. When using \u03b1-ketoisovalerate, all of the Leu \u03b41/\u03b42 and Val \u03b31/\u03b32 methyl groups are simultaneously labeled, causing serious signal overlapping, particularly in large proteins, and thus hampering precise signal assignments. Moreover, when the alternatively methyl 13C-labeled \u03b1-ketoisovalerate is used, the labeling rates for each Leu \u03b41/\u03b42 and Val \u03b31/\u03b32 remain 50% or lower. As a consequence, the signal intensities of the inter-residue methyl-methyl NOEs, which are critical data for precise structural analyses of proteins, are only 25% of the maximum values. Therefore, the widely used \u03b1-ketoisovalerate is not ideal for the residue- and stereo-selective Leu/Val methyl labeling (Fig. 1a, f).",

The precursor, \u03b3-[13C]-aceto-\u03b1-hydroxybutyrate, can specifically label the Ile \u03b32 methyl group in proteins and was successfully used for the sequence-specific signal assignments of the 360 kDa half proteasome complex [21]. For Leu selective labeling, methyl 13C-labeled \u03b1-ketoisocaproate has been developed [22]. Among the several new precursors, the regio-specifically methyl 13C-labeled acetolactate seems to be very useful for Leu and Val methyl labeling. Using \u03b3-[13C]-\u03b1-acetolactate, in lieu of \u03b1-ketoisovalerate, the Val \u03b32 and Leu \u03b42 methyls are specifically labeled with high incorporation rates [23]. The specific labeling of the Val \u03b31 and Leu \u03b41 methyl groups in proteins can be achieved by using \u03b2-[13C]-\u03b1-acetolactate. Therefore, the overcrowded Val \u03b31/\u03b32 and Leu \u03b41/\u03b42 signals in 2D methyl TROSY are improved, and the methyl signal assignments and inter-residue methyl-methyl NOE analyses are achieved clearly and effectively, even in large proteins, such as 82 kDa MSG and 468 kDa PhTET2 [23].",

            "text": "Isotope-labeled amino acids for Val/Leu methyl signal analyses have also been developed. In early studies, stereo-selective deuterated leucine, (2S,4R) [5,5,5-2H3] leucine, was used for the stereospecific methyl signal assignment of Leu residues [24]. Recently, residue- and stereo-specific Val methyl isotope labeling has been achieved, by using [13C]-\u03b1-acetolactate in combination with uniformly deuterated leucine [25]. As a straightforward isotope labeling protocol for Leu and Val residues in a protein, stereo-specifically methyl-labeled leucine and valine were produced [26] (Fig. 1b\u2013e). The E. coli cellular expression using these amino acids, in lieu of isotope-labeled amino acid precursors, allowed the preparation of proteins with labeled Leu \u03b41/\u03b42 and/or Val \u03b31/\u03b32 methyl groups in residue- and stereo-specific manners. Actually, when we prepared 82 kDa malate synthase G (MSG) samples using 2 mg of \u03b42-Leu in 100 ml deuterated M9 medium (i.e., 20 mg/L \u03b42-Leu), all 70 Leu residues in MSG gave highly sensitive and well-dispersed 1H-13C HMQC signals for Leu \u03b42, without serious signal overlapping (Fig. 1g). Therefore, the residue- and stereo-specific signal assignments can be achieved very efficiently and precisely. Moreover, this method allows the differential isotope labeling for Leu \u03b41/\u03b42 and Val \u03b31/\u03b32 methyl groups in any combination. For example, we could obtain Val \u03b31 and Leu \u03b42 methyl signals in the same HMQC spectrum, by using \u03b31-Val and \u03b42-Leu (Fig. 1h). This methyl labeling scheme cannot be achieved by using isotope-labeled amino acid precursors. The Leu-Val combinatorially labeled protein gives inter-residue methyl-methyl NOEs with all stereochemical pairs, which are extremely useful for obtaining precise structural information about large proteins. The incorporation efficiencies attained by adding relatively small amounts of labeled Leu (20 mg/L) and Val (100 mg/L) are over 90% and 80%, respectively. Accordingly, highly sensitive measurements and unambiguous assignments of the inter-methyl NOEs for the Leu and Val residues of 82 kDa MSG were achieved [26].",

As a result, the biosynthetic pathways from pyruvate to l-isoleucine, l-leucine, and l-valine in this E. coli strain are completely aborted. Using this auxotrophic E. coli mutant strain for preparing 13C-methyl-labeled proteins, the incorporation efficiencies of exogenous isotope-labeled isoleucine, leucine, and valine are nearly 100% without any scrambling, even with the supplementation of only 10 mg/L of each amino acid [28]. These methods are particularly useful when expensive isotope-labeled amino acids, such as stereo-array isotope-labeled (SAIL) amino acids, must be used for NMR studies, as described in the next section.

            "text": "The elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of a protein is an important focus of NMR studies. The determination of a protein structure is performed by collecting the NOE-derived distance restraints between the protons in the protein. If the size of the target protein is less than 25 kDa, then the structure determination can be performed using the uniformly 13C/15N-labeled (UL) protein. In this case, the backbone and side-chain resonances in the target protein are assigned by 13C- or 15N-edited multidimensional experiments and then NOESY experiments are applied. However, the application of this conventional method to proteins larger than 25 kDa may not be practical. With an increase in the molecular weight of a protein, the NMR analysis of the protein becomes more challenging due to the increased line broadening and serious overlapping of NMR signals. The stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method was developed to solve these fundamental problems encountered in NMR studies of large proteins. The SAIL method employs proteins exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically 2H-, 13C-, and 15N-labeled amino acids (SAIL amino acids) for NMR experiments. The SAIL amino acids are chemically synthesized and then incorporated into a target protein by a cell-free protein expression system. The isotope labeling pattern profoundly improves the sensitivity and mitigates the signal overlap [29, 30]. In the methylene groups in SAIL proteins, for example, one of the two methylene protons is stereo-specifically substituted by 2H. While the NOE peaks involving the substituted proton are undetectable, the peak intensity of the other methylene proton is exceptionally improved, and the signal overlapping between the two methylene protons is eliminated. As a result, the NOEs involving the methylene proton can be observed. Notably, since the methylene protein is stereo-assigned, the NOE-derived restraints contribute to defining the structure of the protein. Besides the methylene groups, such stereo- and regio-specific labeling are applied for the prochiral methyl groups of Leu and Val residues. Furthermore, the methyl groups are kept as 13CHD2, such that the proton density of the proton is reduced, and thus more quantitative NOEs are obtainable. In the aromatic rings, specific C-H moieties are kept as 13C-1H, and the adjacent C-H moieties are 12C-2H (Fig. 2).",

The line width of each resonance in the SAIL protein is much narrower than that in a conventional uniformly 13C/15N-labeled (UL) protein, and the signal overlap problem is significantly mitigated. In the case of an aromatic moiety, a constant time scheme is not needed due to the absence of one-bond 13C-13C coupling in the ring. Since fewer protons serve as the source of NOEs, as compared to UL proteins, the spin diffusion is highly suppressed, enabling the acquisition of more quantitative and sensitive NOEs [36].",

In the aromatic rings of SAIL amino acids, a CH moiety is labeled as 13C-1H, and the other protons and carbons are kept as 12C and 2H. To examine whether the position of the 13C-1H moieties in the phenyl ring influences the NMR analysis, we synthesized three types of SAIL Phe and Tyr residues to observe the aromatic signals at the \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6 positions. The \u03b4-, \u03b5-, and \u03b6-SAIL Phe residues were incorporated into an 18.2 kDa protein, E. coli peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase b (EPPIb), and the aromatic CH signals were observed. As compared to UL proteins, each peak was clearly detected by virtue of the elimination of the scalar and dipolar couplings. Twelve signals were observed for the \u03b6-SAIL Phe-labeled EPPIb, in agreement with the number of Phe residues in the protein. Interestingly, however, only nine CH signals were detected for the \u03b4- and \u03b5-SAIL Phe-labeled proteins (Fig. 3). This phenomenon was ascribed to the exchange broadening derived from the ring flipping for the three missing CH signals, which will be described later in detail. The NOE constraints involving the \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6 protons of Phe/Tyr residues are complementary, and thus by combining the NOE restraints obtained using different SAIL proteins (i.e., \u03b4-SAIL Phe/Tyr, \u03b5-SAIL Phe/Tyr, and \u03b6-SAIL Tyr), the quality of the NMR structure can be further improved [37]. As with the Phe and Tyr residues, the spectral improvement in Trp residues is also enormous. In the SAIL Trp, the 13C-1H moieties are located at the \u03b41, \u03b53, and \u03b72 positions. In terms of a protein structural study, an interesting point in the analysis of Trp residues is that the \u03c72 conformation can be determined, based on the intra-residue NOEs involving H\u03b23 and either the H\u03b41 or H\u03b53 proton [38].",

The LASBM was first detected through NMR observations of the rotations of the side-chain aromatic rings of phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues, embedded in the hydrophobic core of proteins, about their C\u03b2-C\u03b3 axis in solution. Since the embedded aromatic rings are tightly packed by the surrounding atoms of other residues in the crystal form, the explanation for the ring-flipping phenomenon is that proteins transiently undergo large-amplitude fluctuations involving the formation of a large space, which allows the ring-flipping motion to occur.",

So far, we have designed and synthesized three types of phenylalanine and tyrosine residues, in which the 1H-13C pairs at the \u03b4, \u03b5, or \u03b6 positions have alternate isotope labeling patterns [31, 37]. Importantly, the CH bond at the \u03b6 position is located on the rotational axis, and thus its line shape is insensitive to the ring-flipping rate. However, if another kind of conformational exchange is present, then the effect is manifested on the line shape of the CH signals at the \u03b6 position.

The interactions between FKBP12 and the immunosuppressant serve as a model for designing protein-ligand interactions. FK506 and rapamycin are both macrolides with the FKBP12-binding region on one side. The chemical structures of the FKBP12-binding sites are identical in the two macrolides. When the two complexes are compared, the atomic coordinates of the molecular interfaces are indistinguishable between them. The binding interface includes several aromatic residues, and thus the ring-flipping motions of the interfacial aromatic rings were compared, based on the NMR line shapes and exchange experiments. In the free form, the \u03b4- and \u03b5-CH signals of Phe in FKBP12 are averaged. Upon binding to rapamycin, the signals of Tyr26 located in the binding interface were broadened, while these signals were resolved upon binding to FK506 (Fig. 5). The distinct line broadening indicates that the LASBMs occurring in the binding interfaces are different between the two complexes. The relationship between the different interface dynamics and the biological functions serves as an interesting future subject of study.",

            "text": "Hydrogen atoms attached to polar groups, such as backbone amide groups and hydroxyl (OH), sulfhydryl (SH), and amino (NH2) groups, exchange with the solvent water. The exchange frequency is closely associated with the environment at the position, such as the involvement in hydrogen bonding, the depth from the molecular surface, and the occurrence of conformational fluctuations allowing access to the solvent water. Therefore, the hydrogen exchange of polar groups provides detailed information about the structures and dynamics of proteins, and numerous NMR hydrogen exchange studies have been reported. However, almost all of them focused on the non-exchangeable protons of amino acid residues, and there are very few NMR studies of polar side-chain groups. One reason for this is that the protons attached to polar groups exchange quickly with the water protons, and thus they are assumed to be rarely detectable by NMR. To expand the range of NMR hydrogen exchange studies to polar side-chain groups, we have developed NMR methods to investigate their hydrogen exchange rates in proteins by observing the line shapes of the 13C-NMR signals of carbons attached to the polar groups, in a mixture of H2O and D2O [41, 45, 46, 47]. The 13C chemical shifts of carbon atoms attached to protonated and deuterated polar groups are slightly, but significantly, different due to the H/D isotope shift effect. Given a hydrogen exchange rate slower than the size of the isotope shift, the 13C signals attached to protonated and deuterated polar groups are resolved in the H2O/D2O mixture; otherwise, the 13C signals are observed as an averaged single peak.",

            "text": "The key requirement for this method is that the line widths of the 13C signals from the carbon attached the polar groups are narrowed sufficiently to resolve the protonated and deuterated states. For this purpose, we synthesized amino acids in which the target carbon is site-specifically enriched by 13C carbon and the protons, if present, are deuterated. For investigating Tyr OH groups, for example, we synthesized the \u03b6-SAIL Tyr. In this labeling pattern, the \u03b6-carbon attached to the OH group is enriched by 13C, and the other aromatic carbons were kept as 12C. To assign the \u03b6-carbon, the \u03b41 and \u03b42 protons were kept as 1H, while the \u03b51 and \u03b52 were 2H, such that the \u03b6-carbon is correlated with the \u03b4-protons via three-bond J coupling, and then to the \u03b23 proton via the NOE. This \u03b6-SAIL Tyr was incorporated into the 18.2 kDa E. coli peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase b (EPPIb), and the Tyr \u03b6-carbon signals were observed in H2O, D2O and a 1:1 mixture. EPPIb contains three Tyr residues, Tyr30, Tyr36, and Tyr120. Interestingly, the signals of Tyr30 and Tyr36 were observed as a doublet, comprising the protonated and deuterated isotopomers, while that of Tyr120 was an averaged peak, indicating that the hydrogen exchange rates of the OH groups in Tyr30 and Ty36 were slower than the isotope shift (~10 s\u22121) and that in Tyr120 was faster than the size of the line width (Fig. 6). Notably, the slowly exchanging OH protons identified through the 13C observations in H2O and D2O are detectable by 1H NMR. Such slowly exchanging and thus detectable 1Hs serve as sources of NOEs for determining the conformations of polar side-chain groups.",

Such conformational and dynamic properties of protein disulfide bonds represent an important subject for NMR studies. We initially developed a method for determining the connectivity and conformation of a protein disulfide bond by observing the quantitative NOEs between the \u03b2-protons in the two Cys residues across the disulfide bond [48]. The problem encountered in observing the quantitative NOEs is that fast spin diffusion between the geminal \u03b2-protons occurs in conventional [U-13C, 15N] proteins. To overcome this issue, we prepared proteins selectively labeled with an equimolar mixture of (2R,3S)-[\u03b2-13C;\u03b1,\u03b2-2H2] Cys and (2R,3R)-[\u03b2-13C;\u03b1,\u03b2-2H2] Cys, but otherwise fully deuterated, to observe the quantitative NOEs. In the labeling pattern, since either one of the prochiral methylene protons , namely, \u03b22 (proS) or \u03b23 (proR), is always replaced with a deuteron and no other protons remain in proteins prepared by this labeling scheme, all four of the expected NOEs for the \u03b2-protons across disulfide bonds could be measured without any spin diffusion interference, even with long mixing times (Fig. 7). With the NOE information, accurate distances were evaluated for the four \u03b2-proton pairs, and thus the conformation could be determined. This method was applied to the three disulfide bonds in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrating the feasibility of this method [48].",

We probed the conformational isomerization of the Cys14-Cys38 disulfide bond in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), by an NMR line-shape analysis of its Cys carbon peaks [49]. In this case, the targeted carbons are site-specifically enriched by 13C, and the proton attached to the carbon is deuterated. The 1D 13C spectra were then recorded at small temperature intervals for the BPTI samples, and the recorded peaks were displayed in the order of the temperature. As the result, the exchange broadening that became altered with temperature was manifested for the carbon peaks of Cys14 and Cys38 over the profile of the line shape. Interestingly, biphasic exchange broadening was observed for the Cys14 \u03b1-carbon peak, which is consistent with the report that the Cys14-Cys38 disulfide bond exists in equilibrium between a high-populated state (M) and two low-populated states (mc14 and mc38). This line-shape analysis is useful for detecting and characterizing the conformational isomerization of protein disulfide bonds. ",
