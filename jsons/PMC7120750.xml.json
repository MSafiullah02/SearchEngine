However, this is not a new idea and there are examples of One Health approaches being adopted prior to this time, especially for zoonotic diseases such as rabies. The role of environmental factors in infectious diseases has also been recognized for hundreds of years, even if the mechanisms involved in the interactions were poorly understood (Brandt 2012). Hong Kong, a crowded city where outbreaks of infectious disease can spread rapidly, provides a good example of the benefits of a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach to disease control and prevention for both human and animal health.",

Reports of an outbreak of disease with high mortality in pigs in cities along the Chinese coast in the wake of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, probably represented spill-over of the pandemic virus to swine (Chun et al. 1919); a situation reminiscent of that following the 2009 human influenza pandemic. In a seminal series of studies from 1977 onward, Shortridge et al. studied animal viruses in order to understand human influenza pandemic emergence (Shortridge 1992). In the course of these investigations, they elucidated much of the ecology of influenza in poultry, wild birds, swine, and horses in the region. They demonstrated a diversity of influenza virus subtypes circulating in domestic poultry and that domestic ducks had a much higher rate of carriage of influenza virus subtypes than chickens and other terrestrial birds (Shortridge 1982). All avian viruses isolated (including H5N2 and H5N3), met established criteria for low pathogenic influenza viruses.",

He presciently suggested that \u201cpigs may serve as a potential reservoir for future human pandemics as well as a possible source of genetic information for recombination between human and porcine strains of influenza virus\u201d (Shortridge et al. 1977). Given the farming practices in China provide opportunities for close interactions between domestic ducks and other poultry with swine and humans, it was suggested that swine may serve as a mixing vessel for pandemic emergence (Scholtissek et al. 1985) and, since the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 started in China, that China was a pandemic epicenter (Shortridge and Stuart-Harris 1982). Among other things, Shortridge also investigated outbreaks of equine influenza (H3N8) in race-horses in Hong Kong in 1992 (Watkins et al. 1993) and elsewhere.",

Collaborative studies between the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation and The University of Hong Kong identified this to be caused by a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype. Two other farms also reported outbreaks characterized by high mortality in April and May 1997 caused by the same virus. No further cases were detected in poultry for the next 6 months despite investigations of a number of other disease outbreaks on poultry farms. The incident was reported to the relevant international veterinary authority, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). As outbreaks of HPAI at this time were not considered to have public health relevance, the public health authorities (the Department of Health) were not informed of this event.",

It took 3 months for the virus to be identified as a HPAI H5N1 virus (Claas et al. 1998). In retrospect, if the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept had been in application and relevant public health authorities were made aware of the outbreak of H5N1 HPAI in poultry, the identification of the virus isolate from this child as a H5N1 virus may have occurred sooner.

As the number of human cases increased, a range of interim control measures, including a temporary short term suspension of trade in live poultry and improved cleaning of markets were implemented. But further human cases occurred, associated with significant mortality; ultimately 6 of the 18 diagnosed cases proved fatal. There was no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission. Still, there were growing concerns in the local and international press about the potential for emergence of a severe influenza pandemic that may rival the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic.",

The next day, a batch of birds showing signs consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in the main wholesale market, and the decision was taken to cull all chickens on commercial farms and in LPM in Hong Kong, based on an assessment of the risk that the continued exposure of humans to this virus posed, not only to the citizens of Hong Kong, but potentially to global public health. These decisions had to be made on the best available information at the time and from first principles of disease control and prevention. Some 1.5 million poultry were killed and sent to landfill for appropriate burial in a 5 day period from December 29. These measures resulted in the elimination of the 1997 H5N1 Hong Kong strain, and no new locally acquired human cases occurred in Hong Kong after depopulation of poultry in markets.",

            "text": "Just prior to and during the major culling exercise in 1997, a number of cross disciplinary investigations were conducted that, over time, provided confirmation of the importance of poultry and LPM in the epidemiology of this disease. Surveillance studies in markets in Hong Kong revealed a very high prevalence of infection in poultry in markets, with almost 20 % of chickens in markets being infected at the time of the mass poultry cull (Shortridge 1999). This demonstrated the importance of implementing measures to control infection in markets. Given the probable high exposure of people to infected poultry, the limited number of human cases suggested that transmission of the virus from birds to humans was very inefficient. Epidemiological studies to assess risk factors for human infection were carried out in collaboration with staff of the US Centers for Disease Control, who were invited to Hong Kong to assist with the investigation. These revealed that a visit to a live poultry market in the 7 days prior to disease onset was a significant risk factor (Mounts et al. 1999). Overall, few people in Hong Kong had antibodies to H5 virus (other than some who worked with poultry, some health workers and some government workers involved in culling operations) indicating that transmission of the virus from poultry to human and from human-to-human was exceedingly inefficient (Buxton Bridges et al. 2000; Bridges et al. 2002).",

H5N1 viruses from humans and poultry were very similar and retained avian-characteristics in all 8 gene segments with no evidence of reassortment with human or swine influenza viruses. This indicated direct avian-to-human transmission. The virus retained signatures in the hemagglutinin that indicated a preference for binding alpha 2\u20133 linked sialosides found on avian cells (Claas et al. 1998; Suarez et al. 1998; Subbarao et al. 1998). The Hong Kong 1997 H5N1 virus had acquired its hemagglutinin from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (gs/Gd/96)-like HPAI H5N1 viruses first isolated from an outbreak of disease in geese in 1996 in Guangdong, (Xu et al. 1999). The other gene segments of the H5N1/97 viruses were probably derived from low pathogenic H9N2 (G1-lineage) or H6N1 viruses that were common in quail and other game-poultry species. This particular gene constellation has not been seen since. Thus, H5N1/1997 may have arisen within Hong Kong or in the markets or farms supplying Hong Kong through reassortment between gs/Gd/96-like and H9N2 or H6N1 viruses (Guan et al. 1999; Hoffmann et al. 2000).",

This indicated that gs/Gd/96-like HPAI H5N1 viruses continued to circulate in geese in mainland China. In 2000, further viruses were isolated from geese and ducks imported into Hong Kong with evidence of novel reassortants in ducks, indicating that this virus was undergoing rapid genetic change in ducks (Guan et al. 2002a). This served as a warning that H5N1 viruses were on the move, both geographically and genetically. This information was shared freely with and between the parties involved in control of avian influenza as soon as it became available and proved to be extremely valuable.

The routine active surveillance system which involves monthly sampling of fecal droppings in LPM led to the detection of H5N1 HPAI viruses from apparently healthy birds. Subsequently, die-offs were noted in poultry within these markets, leading to a second cull of 1.3 million poultry across all LPM in Hong Kong, predominantly birds on farms that could not be sold due to the closure of markets (Sims et al. 2003a, b). The gs/Gd/96-like H5N1 virus had been replaced by a number of novel HPAI H5N1 reassortants, which were all distinct from the H5N1/97 virus (Guan et al. 2002b). It is important to note that without the active virologic surveillance of apparently healthy poultry in these markets, the initial incursion of H5N1 viruses would have probably gone unnoticed, possibly for many months, leading to reexposure of the human population to significant zoonotic risk. The viruses isolated were undergoing rapid evolution with viruses from clade 0, clade1, clade3, clade 4, and clade 8 all detected during the period from 2001 to 2003 along with multiple genotypes.",

The evening prior to the rest day, all live poultry were sold or slaughtered and the market was empty of poultry during the rest day, when the markets were cleaned and disinfected. Subsequent studies, using the endemic poultry H9N2 subtype viruses as an indicator, demonstrated the impact of the rest day in reducing virus isolation rates and implied that avian influenza viruses entered markets infrequently, but then amplified and were maintained in these retail LPMs (Kung et al. 2003). Continued introduction of fresh poultry into these markets, a proportion of them remaining in the markets for a day or two before slaughter allowed time for virus transmission within these markets without overt large-scale die-offs in the birds (because few of them stayed for long enough for the full-blown disease to manifest. Heterosubtypic immunity from prior exposure to H9N2 viruses may also have played a role in masking severe disease in HPAI H5N1 infected birds (Seo and Webster 2001)",

This farm was located in an area with a high density of poultry farms and those in the vicinity were quarantined and later depopulated. By mid February, 17 of 18 farms in the vicinity were affected and depopulated. There was a diversity of H5N1 virus genotypes (n = 6) in the markets, and a smaller diversity of viruses affecting the farms (3 genotypes). Epidemiological investigations suggested a small number of introductions to farms followed by limited lateral spread (Sims et al. 2003b; Kung et al. 2007). A case\u2014control study was conducted to identify farm practices and other factors associated with increased risk of infection. This analysis identified that direct sales of poultry from the farms to the retail markets (by-passing the wholesale market, where cages returning to farms were thoroughly washed) was associated with increased risk of farms acquiring infection (Fig. 1) (Kung et al. 2007). The retail LPM were serving as an amplifier of virus as well as disseminating virus back to farms. Thus, while LPM were a \u201cdead-end\u201d for the poultry, it was not a \u201cdead-end\u201d for the virus.

This was the first report of this Asian lineage H5N1 HPAI virus, causing severe and lethal disease in ducks and also affecting wild birds (Sturm-Ramirez et al. 2004). HPAI was previously believed not to cause severe disease in ducks and experimental studies with the 1997 virus had shown this to be the case (Perkins and Swayne 2002). Kowloon Park was home to a range of rare and protected species. The control measures implemented included strict isolation, culling, increased sanitation, and also vaccination, were successful in containing that outbreak, although with significant loss of valuable bird species. Around this time, H5N1 HPAI virus was also detected in a few LPM and in a poultry farm. The vaccination program for chicken farms was enlarged to cover some other farms, but a subsequent outbreak occurred in several adjacent unvaccinated farms. Vaccination was successfully used in the face of an outbreak to control the disease in unaffected poultry houses (Ellis et al. 2004a).",

Following an outbreak of disease caused by H5N1 HPAI virus in migratory wild birds in Qinghai lake in April\u2013May 2005 caused by a clade 2.2 virus (Chen et al. 2005), there was further spread of that virus to Central and South Asia, the middle-east, Africa, and Europe. By end of 2006, 115 human H5N1 cases had been cumulatively reported, from Azerbaijan, Cambodia, mainland China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam (WHO 2012).

            "text": "Hong Kong had also initiated active surveillance in live wild birds at the Mai Po nature reserve and wetland park, and of dead wild birds detected anywhere in Hong Kong. Since 2005, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation provided a round-the-clock service for examination of wild birds collected dead or in a weak state; for example, 8,700 wild bird carcasses were tested in 2007. Up to 2012, more than 100 carcasses have been found to be infected with H5N1 virus. While a range of low pathogenic influenza viruses of diverse subtypes were detected in live wild birds in Mai Po nature reserve, no H5N1 HPAI viruses were detected in live wild birds (Leung 2011). However, the program of dead wild bird surveillance repeatedly led to the detection of H5N1 HPAI viruses in a range of wild aquatic birds (e.g. pond herons, grey herons, egrets), birds of prey (Peregrine falcons, Buzzards), and passerine birds (Smith et al. 2009; Ellis et al. 2009). Detection of infection tended to be commoner in the winter months. While infection of migratory birds and birds of prey may be understandable in the context of ongoing infection in poultry in the wider region, the source of infection of passerine birds was more of an enigma. \u201cBird-release\u201d to acquire religious merit is a religious and cultural activity common in Hong Kong and other Asian countries. This demand has led to a commercialized and large-scale trapping and transborder trading activity and it was estimated that 680,000\u20131,050,000 birds were imported legally (and sometimes illegally) into Hong Kong to service this trade. Although direct proof is lacking, it is possible that these birds acquired infection during this trade and importation, and bird-release of infected birds may explain the detection of some H5N1 infected dead birds (Chan 2006). Clustering of wild bird cases in the area around the pet bird market in Hong Kong in 2006 and 2007 provides further evidence to support this proposition during those 2 years (Anonymous 2006). However, the pattern of detection changed in 2008 onward with no cases detected near this market (Anonymous 2006\n).",

In December 2008, a poultry farm in Hong Kong was found to be infected, the alert being raised by the death of chickens. These clade 2.3.4 viruses were found to be antigenic variants, which evade the immunity conferred by the contemporary H5 vaccine (Leung 2011). However, the majority of HPAI H51 viruses being detected in wild birds in Hong Kong in recent years were clade 2.3.2.1 viruses.

Building these measures was an interactive process based on experiences, experiments, and epidemiological investigations from and after 1997.

This evidence convinced relevant authorities in Guangdong to control these markets and to ban the sale of civet cats within them, very likely aborting a reemergence of SARS (Wang et al. 2005). The search for the animal reservoir led to the identification of bats as the source of the precursor of SARS CoV, and also to the recognition that bats may serve as a reservoir for a number of virus families including the coronaviruses (Vijaykrishna et al. 2007).",
