The Bocaviruses so far identified include bovine parvovirus type 1 (BPV) (Chen et al., 1986), canine minute virus (CnMV) (Schwartz et al., 2002) and the recently identified human bocavirus (HBoV) (Allander et al., 2005). BPV causes diarrhea and mild respiratory symptoms in calves inoculated intranasally (Via et al., 2006). CnMV is associated with fetal infections leading to reproductive failure and neonatal respiratory disease (Parrish, 2006). HBoV was first cloned from pooled human respiratory tract samples collected in Sweden and was classified provisionally into the genus Bocavirus based on sequence comparisons (Allander et al., 2005). However, similar to the bovine bocavirus BPV, HBoV was recently reported to be associated with acute gastroenteritis (Lau et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2007, Mackay, 2007).",

The incidence of HBoV has been reported to be between 1.5% and 11.3% based on tests of respiratory samples from individuals with acute respiratory illness (Allander et al., 2005, Arnold et al., 2006, Bastien et al., 2006, Choi et al., 2006, Foulongne et al., 2006, Lin et al., 2007, Ma et al., 2006, Qu et al., 2007, Sloots et al., 2006, Weissbrich et al., 2006). HBoV appears to be associated with lower respiratory tract infections, and in many cases, co-infection with other respiratory viruses (Allander et al., 2007, Fry et al., 2007). The frequency of detection suggests that HBoV is less common than respiratory syncytial virus and probably also rhinoviruses in infants with respiratory illnesses. However, the virus is approximately as common as influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 3, and adenoviruses and is probably more common than coronaviruses and the other parainfluenza viruses (McIntosh, 2006).",

At this time, neither virus isolation nor infectious clone has been reported. Serological study of HBoV infection in Japan has shown an overall seroprevalence rate of 71.1% against the VP1 protein of HBoV using an immunofluorescence assay in a population aged from 0 months to 41 years (Endo et al., 2007). Currently, detection of human bocavirus in children with lower respiratory tract infections relies on DNA amplification by PCR, however, PCR assays do not reflect the course of HBoV infection. Therefore, a method to detect HBoV infection in a large scale is required to diagnose and characterize the role of HBoV in human disease. Purified HBoV proteins are needed to develop an accurate and efficient enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to help characterize potential HBoV etiology of lower respiratory tract infections.",

A concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml in 100 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, was determined to develop an OD value of approximately 1.0 at 450 nm with two strong reactive serum (Serums #2 and #17) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS (Fig. 4A). Serums #2 and #17 were also confirmed to be strongly reactive with the VP2 protein by immunoblot (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Next, ELISAs were performed on serially diluted sera from selected healthy blood donors. The test produced typical ELISA curves with an end point (with an OD value below 0.2 at 1:400 dilution for negative sera and 1:6400 for positive sera) (Fig. 4A). The presumed negative serums #13 and #14 were also confirmed to be so by immunoblot (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4).

The mean (N) of these 20 sera from healthy blood donors was 0.116. Therefore, a cut-off value of 0.3, which is equal to a P/N value of 2.5, was used in our data analysis. Thus, all the serum samples with an OD of 0.30 were putatively considered IgG positive for HBoV in this study. When this assay was applied to the remaining adult serum samples it was determined that 50% (10/20) of the sera from these healthy adult US blood donors aged 18\u201365 years were positive for HBoV IgG (cut-off = 0.3), some with a high titer [e.g., serum #2 with a titer of 1:1600 (Fig. 4A)].",

In the group of healthy children over 9 years of age, nearly half (48%) had apparently been previously infected with this virus, as the level of IgG antibody was high in this group (Fig. 5B). Therefore, HBoV infection in children clearly occurs frequently as the virus specific antibodies last longer than the viruses in patient after an acute viral infection.",

This ELISA showed specificity for the HBoV VP2 protein; no cross-reactivity was observed with the closely related bovine bocavirus BPV capsid. This is the first report to demonstrate that the HBoV VP2 protein is capable of forming VLPs, and the second to show the presence of HBoV specific IgG antibody in human sera. Importantly, a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody in relative age groups of children with acute respiratory infection was found compared with that of children without acute respiratory infection, suggesting that HBoV may be an agent causing or playing a role in acute respiratory infection in children. Nevertheless, characterization of the presence of IgM antibody or IgG in double serum samples is required in subsequent studies for precisely evaluating the status of infection of HBoV in acute respiratory infection. In addition, a high positive rate of HBoV IgG antibody in sera from healthy U.S. blood donors (aged 18\u201365 years) was observed in this study, indicating HBoV infection is widespread in the U.S. Together, these results also indicate that HBoV is likely first encountered in childhood, which is consistent with previous suggestions (Allander et al., 2005, Arnold et al., 2006, Bastien et al., 2006, Choi et al., 2006, Foulongne et al., 2006, Lin et al., 2007, Ma et al., 2006, Qu et al., 2007, Sloots et al., 2006, Weissbrich et al., 2006).",

The relatively lower positive rate in our study, compared to that of the Japanese group could be explained if the immuofluorescence assay used by the Japanese group also detected HBoV specific IgM in the tested sera (Endo et al., 2007). For children clinically diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections in the study presented here, HBoV IgG seroprevalence rates were as follows: 22% in children younger than 12 months of age, 31% in children 1\u20132 years of age, and 60% in children 3 years of age. However, a high level of IgG was observed in positive sera from the children with lower respiratory tract infections [11% (18/161) had an OD value of higher than 0.8]. Either re-infection or acute infection of HBoV may have occurred, and HBoV may have been the causative agent for lower respiratory tract infections in these children. Only 5 of 161 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples (3.1%) from these children showed a significant level of HBoV genome (6.6 \u00d7 103\u20134.8 \u00d7 106\n gc/ml). Interestingly, all of these five children were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections and had a significant IgG antibody titer (OD > 0.4); three of them had a high IgG antibody titer (OD > 0.7), which suggested acute infection of HBoV. HBoV co-infection with other respiratory viruses (Allander et al., 2007, Fry et al., 2007) has been found in many cases, therefore, the role of HBoV in lower respiratory tract infections is unclear. This study was designed initially to probe the independent pathogenesis of HBoV in lower respiratory tract infections. A high level of IgG (11% had an OD value of higher than 0.8) in positive sera from children with lower respiratory tract infections suggests, but certainly does not prove, that HBoV may cause infection independently.",

Infection with B19 occurs in children in a high incidence asymptomatically. Specific IgG antibodies appear several days after IgM and persist for years. Seropositivity to B19 (IgG) has been shown to reach 80% in healthy European blood donors (Gallinella et al., 2003). Thus, infection with HBoV might also occur widely. A high seroprevalence in healthy children and adults suggests that most HBoV infections do not require medical attention in children.",

This parvoviral like particle did not hemagglutinate human \u201cO\u201d type red blood cells unlike the bovine bocavirus BPV. An ELISA based on these VLPs was established for detection of IgG antibody against HBoV in sera. A significant difference in serum reactivity to HBoV VLPs was observed; a high percentage with higher OD values were present in sera from children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections compared with sera from healthy children. Therefore, this VLPs-based ELISA was appropriate for early diagnosis of HBoV infection and for further study of the virus and its infection in children with lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, HBoV VLPs have the potential to be used in the future for vaccine development.",
