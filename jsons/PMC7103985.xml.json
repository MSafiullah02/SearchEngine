During any inter-pandemic year, there are an estimated 1 billion cases of influenza worldwide with 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and 300,000\u2013500,000 deaths [1]. Fear of the global spread of serious respiratory disease persists in the light of past pandemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, and the recent emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2]. Ever-increasing international travel intensifies the risk of the spread of emerging novel viruses, further intensifying the concern [3]. Mass gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage pose a particular risk for transmission of respiratory viruses [4], [5].",

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a household setting found that adherence to facemask use decreased the risk of influenza-like illness (ILI) [7]. Meta-analysis of data from 6 trials shows that wearing facemasks is protective against ILI, but did not show that facemasks are protective against laboratory-confirmed influenza, perhaps due to limitations of the studies (Fig. 1\n) [18]. Interestingly, one nested case\u2013control study showed that intermittent facemask use was associated with a significantly greater risk of infection among healthcare workers at Hajj, suggesting perhaps that infectious material that settles on facemasks can become a source of direct hand transmission to the respiratory tract [19]. Standard facemasks may prevent: (i) acquisition of infection by droplet and/or aerosol spread, or conversely, (ii) transmission from infected subjects [20], [21].",

The largest study undertaken to date was a cluster-randomised trial in 509 households, with 2788 recruits; it did not find an additional benefit from the combination of facemasks and hand hygiene over health education (regarding preventive measures) on the overall rate of laboratory-confirmed viral infection, although there was a benefit against secondary transmission of RTI and laboratory-confirmed influenza. The authors pointed to concerns about both under-powering of the study and poor compliance with mask use [11]. Bin Reza et al. recommended that sufficient power may be achieved by larger trials that are multi-centred and run for several years [6]. The authors of this study contend, in addition, that taking important steps to improve compliance with mask use is also critical to inducing a form of herd immunity through widespread mask use. There are considerable logistic and cost issues to consider in the design and conduct of such trials, but the public health benefits of a positive result could be substantial.",

It is believed that this data may be useful to other mass gatherings, such as the Olympics, and perhaps to other closed settings such as hospitals, schools, airplanes, ships and airport settings. It also represents a powerful opportunity to study precise patterns of virus transmission through detailed comparison of circulating viral strains. It is hoped that the outcomes of this study will inform global health authorities about the effective control of respiratory viral infection.",
