The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), belongs to the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales, and it causes respiratory problems in pigs of all ages and reproductive failure in sows, including still births and mummification, birth of weak piglets and high pre-weaning mortality (Kimman et al., 2009, Rossow et al., 1994). Genetic and antigenic analyses have revealed two distinct PRRSV genotypes, European (type 1) and North American (type 2). Marked genetic and antigenic differences of up to 40% are observed between the type 1 and type 2 PRRSV genotypes (Kim et al., 2007, Nelsen et al., 1999). In addition, within the genotypes up to 30% genetic variation for type I and 21% for type II PRRSV do exist (Kim et al., 2007, Zimmerman et al., 2012). This implies complexity of the PRRSV and difficulties to develop protective vaccines (Li et al., 2010).",

Two types of PRRSV vaccines are commercially available, modified live virus (MLV) vaccine and a killed virus (KV) vaccine (Charerntantanakul, 2009). PRRS MLV vaccine has been shown to provide protective efficacy against PRRSV infection in the field; however, it provides limited protection against heterologous viruses. Additionally, PRRS MLV vaccine has the intrinsic risk of reversion to a virulent strain (Kwang et al., 1999). Though PRRS KV vaccine is safe to use in pigs, it elicits insufficient immunity in pigs (Lee et al., 2014). Overall, commercially available PRRS KV vaccine does not induce strong required immune response, and thus failed to protect pigs against viremia to homologous as well as heterologous viral challenges (Nilubol et al., 2004, Scortti et al., 2007, Zuckermann et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Interestingly, experimental studies showed that it is possible to induce production of virus neutralizing (VN) antibody response in na\u00efve pigs by immunization with inactivated PRRSV (Misinzo et al., 2006, Renukaradhya et al., 2015a). Passive transfer studies demonstrated that the PRRS VN antibody response is responsible for viral clearance from the blood and lungs, and reduce transplacental transmission of the virus, thus played a significant role in protective immune response against PRRS (Lopez and Osorio, 2004, Osorio et al., 2002). Recent research efforts aimed to improve protective immune response to PRRS KV have been focused on utilizing potent vaccine adjuvants, which help to reduce viremia, lung lesions and clinical disease in homologous and heterogeneous PRRSV challenged pigs. Several types of vaccine adjuvants have been investigated for their ability to potentiate the immune response to PRRS vaccines (Charerntantanakul, 2009, Li et al., 2013), for example polymeric adjuvant Montanide\u2122 Gel (Deville et al., 2012, Parker et al., 2008, Tabynov et al., 2015). Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that Montanide\u2122 Gel 01 potentiates the immune response of a candidate inactivated PRRS vaccine (Tabynov, 2014), but at that time the efficacy was not compared with the commercial vaccine.",

In the D/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs, VN titers against LKZ/2010 were detected at DPFV 42 (Fig. 3\nA). The VN titers in the D/KV/ADJ-vaccinated groups were significantly higher compared to the C/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs at DPC 10 and 14 (P\n < 0.05 to P\n < 0.0001) (Fig. 3A). A rapid VN antibody response against LKZ/2010 virus was observed in the D/KV/ADJ vaccinated pig group 3 indicating that the vaccine induced better protective memory immune response. To assess broad VN antibody activity, we used heterologous PRRSV strain (type 1) CM/08 in VN assay and detected VN titers at DPFV 42 in pig groups 3 and 4 vaccinated with D/KV/ADJ (Fig. 3B). The VN titers of these animals were significantly higher than those of C/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs (group 6) at DPC 12\u201314 (P\n < 0.05 to P\n < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). The VN titers against the challenge virus strain of the pig group 4 vaccinated with D/KV/ADJ and challenged with CM/08 strain were similar to those of group 3 animals challenged with the homologous virus strain LKZ/2010. This indicates that our experimental pigs received PRRSV vaccination (strain LKZ/2010) followed by a heterologous CM/08 strain challenge generated antibodies with a broader neutralizing spectrum.",

However, each vaccine type possesses its own strengths and limitations. Due to safety issues inactivated vaccines are preferred over attenuated vaccines; however, efficacy of current inactivated PRRSV vaccines is questionable (Renukaradhya et al., 2015a, Scortti et al., 2007, Vanhee et al., 2009, Zuckermann et al., 2007). Inactivated PRRSV vaccine under field situations showed to elicit protective immune response under certain conditions, which was depending on the strain of infecting field virus. By employing a controlled inactivation procedure and using a suitable adjuvant, an inactivated PRRSV vaccine could be developed that systematically induces PRRSV specific VN antibody response after two vaccinations in na\u00efve piglets (Nilubol et al., 2004). Serum VN antibodies have been identified as a key component of protective immunity against PRRSV infection (Osorio et al., 2002). Researchers have previously showed that an inactivated vaccine could induce VN antibodies resulting in strong to partial virological protection in challenged pigs (Misinzo et al., 2006, Renukaradhya et al., 2015a). Experiments of passive transfer of VN antibodies in pigs prior to PRRSV infection showed VN antibodies could fully protect pigs against viremia and reproductive failure (Lopez and Osorio, 2004, Osorio et al., 2002). However, others observed only low to moderate degree of protection against heterologous strains of virus when pigs were immunized with inactivated PRRSV vaccines (Labarque et al., 2004, Lager et al., 1999). But intranasal delivery of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticle-entrapped UV-killed PRRSV vaccine adjuvanted with soluble Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived whole-cell lysate showed the induction of cross-protective immune response in pigs (Binjawadagi et al., 2014a, Binjawadagi et al., 2014b).",

However, we did not observe VN titers to LKZ/2010 or CM/08 in the serum pre-challenge, and only a slightly elevated neutralizing antibody response was detected post-challenge in C/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs. These results are consistent with other published studies (Scortti et al., 2007, Zuckermann et al., 2007), wherein vaccination with inactivated PRRSV candidate vaccines slightly improve VN antibody response post-challenge. Moreover, comparable to mock-vaccinated pigs, C/KV/ADJ vaccinated animals became ill post-challenge and manifested characteristic clinical signs of PRRS (severe respiratory disorders with high scores), with simultaneous detection of viremia. Noticeable macroscopic lung lesions were observed at necropsy in all the mock- and C/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs challenged with LKZ/2010 (type 2) or CM/08 (type 1) virus, and detected high challenged viral RNA copy numbers in the lungs. Thus, we conclude that the commercial C/KV/ADJ vaccination in pigs does not protect against clinical disease, viremia and lung lesions against field variants of Kazakh strains of PRRSV. These results are in line with earlier studies, such as vaccination against PRRS in the field provides variable degrees of protection, and reports of clinical outbreaks of PRRS in vaccinated pigs have led to doubts about efficacy of current commercial PRRSV vaccines (Geldhof et al., 2012, Thanawongnuwech and Suradhat, 2010).",

After the third immunization, VN antibodies were detected in all the animals vaccinated with D/KV/ADJ prior to challenge, albeit at low levels. Interestingly, the VN titer did not reduce after challenge in any pig vaccinated with D/KV/ADJ, and the animals had consistently high VN titers against both homologous and heterogeneous PRRSV. This data is in agreement with an earlier study, which showed that high VN titers are required at the time of challenge to offer full protection against high dose of virus used to infect animals (Geldhof et al., 2012). The detectable levels of replicating PRRSV was absent post-challenge in D/KV/ADJ vaccinated pigs, which could be attributed to early appearance (pre-challenge) of VN antibodies targeting the putative neutralizing epitopes on the PRRSV GP5 and M proteins (Yang et al., 2000), but it needs further investigation. Inactivated vaccines predominantly elicit Th2 response (Spellberg and Edwards, 2001), but we cannot exclude the possibility of Th1-Th2-balanced response in D/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs, which also requires further research.",

Similar results were also observed in our previous study with this candidate vaccine, but challenged with a heterologous NADC-8 (type 2) strain of virus (Tabynov, 2014). These findings demonstrated that our candidate killed PRRSV vaccine has a safety profile, and it is efficacious when administered three times at days 0, 21 and 35 to Large-White breed of pigs aged 2 months.",

The reasons beyond better protective response by our candidate vaccine could be attributed to vaccination of pigs three times with Montanide\u2122 SEPPIC adjuvant compared to others, wherein in many vaccine trials killed or subunit PRRSV vaccines were vaccinated twice using relatively weaker adjuvant than Montanide adjuvant (Renukaradhya et al., 2015a). Furthermore, at this moment due to lack of genome sequence data of both the vaccine and challenge viruses, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions on this interesting result.",

Due to lack of sequence data of vaccine and challenge viruses used in this study, it is likely that though the commercial vaccine virus and the challenge virus strain are type 2 viruses, the level of genetic variability is not known.
