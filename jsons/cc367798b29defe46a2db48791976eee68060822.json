Modern states incorporate elaborate public health bureaucracies tasked with either containing or eliminating pathogen outbreaks. States are thus highly cognitive entities at the institutional level. It is then appropriate, indeed arguably necessary, to reconsider vector-borne infection from a control theory perspective.",

A , B are square matrices, x t the vector of system parameters at time t, u t the control vector at time t, and W t a white noise vector. The data rate theorem states that the minimum rate at which control information must be provided for system stability is H > log[| det[A m |], where A m is the subcomponent of A having eigenvalues \u22651. This is interpreted as asserting that the rate of control information must exceed the rate at which the unstable system generates topological information",

As a consequence, if the disease outbreak \"gets inside the command decision loop\" of the bureaucratic entities constituting the \"public health\" response, so that \u03bb becomes negative, then resource demands cannot be met under",
