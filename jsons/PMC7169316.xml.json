If neonatally infected cats are more likely to develop ocular toxoplasmosis, this may help to explain why so many cats in nature are infected but so few develop ocular toxoplasmosis. Results of this study also support the suggestion that some T. gondii strains are oculotropic. With the exception of one kitten, posterior segment lesions in kittens infected with ME\u201049 and Maggie strains were less severe than those in kittens infected with the Mozart strain. Although the role strain played in development of ocular disease in this study is not clear because of the small number of litters studied, and the variations in protocol between litters, our results support a recent study of adult cats orally inoculated with ME\u201049, Maggie, and Mozart cysts, where ocular lesions were detected in one of seven cats, one of five cats and three of five cats, respectively, suggesting strain may be important in development of ocular disease (Lappin MR, unpublished data).",
