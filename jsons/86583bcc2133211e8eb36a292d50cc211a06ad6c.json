The number of viral species recognized to infect human is predicted to rise from less than 10 in 1900 to more than 200 by 2020, with the large majority of the increase since 1960 ( Fig. 10.1 ) [10] . The reasons are diverse and beyond the scope of this chapter, but a shrinking globe puts pathogens from the sub-Saharan rain forest within 24 h of a blood center in the Northern Plains. Urbanization, especially when combined with poverty and overcrowding, and human changes of and encroachment into diverse ecologic niches change host, pathogen, and vector relationships. Alterations of climate and animal husbandry also affect reservoir, pathogen, and vector distributions. New discovery systems like next-generation sequencing and metagenomics identify potential pathogens in the environment, wildlife reservoirs, and humans (our microbiome), well before disease associations are even considered. Social media via the Internet brings us nearly instantaneous news and speculation about new diseases and outbreaks from anywhere in the world. How do we integrate, or decide not to, the potential threats into our blood safety regime? Our difficult task in the transfusion medicine community is choosing a proactive framework within which to approach emerging infections despite initially incomplete information about their impacts on transfusion safety. WNV, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Trypanosoma cruzi, Zika, and Babesia microti are recent demonstrations that zoonotic infections, as they emerge (or emerge in our consciousness), become targets for intervention. There are many other zoonotic and/or arthropod-borne agents for which we have not implemented mitigation measures (beyond the requirement that donors are well when they give) but about which we need to think. They include, but are by no means restricted to, dengue, chikungunya, MERS-CoV, Nipah, Hendra, the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), Bourbon and Powassan viruses, Mayoro virus, the tick-borne agents (Erlichia sp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum) and Leishmania. These agents persist in arthropods and/or nonhuman vertebrate reservoirs with spillover into human populations either by contact or vector transmission. Tick-borne infections are not further considered herein. Year of discovery Zoonotic infections, excluding HIV, have certainly had less clinical impact in transfusion medicine than the classic sexually and parenterally transmitted agents, but, especially under epidemic scenarios, several are presently prominent in conversations about if and when to intervene for blood safety. In this context, we have taken to speculating on the need for interventions for pathogens for which transfusion transmission, when the asymptomatic presence of an agent is biologically plausible, is theoretical. This is indeed proactive, in contrast to our historical approach, but risks a response (and consumption of scarce resources) where none is appropriate. In the best light, this is \"precautionism.\"",

These deferrals aim to prevent an adverse outcome that has proven to be very rare, even in the United Kingdom epicenter of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic [14] . The cost has been the ongoing loss of many thousands of donors for residence in and travel to (and transfusion in some) the countries with risk. In addition to difficult donor counseling sessions, the estimates of donor loss ranged as high as 5% in the United States [15, 16] . We will likely maintain them until concerns about theoretical subsequent waves of the vCJD epidemic, largely related to incubation periods associated with polymorphisms in the human prion protein gene, are adjudicated [17, 18] .",

The large global areas affected by dengue and chikungunya overlap those with endemic malaria, and temporary malaria deferral for travel to these areas surely provides partial protection of the blood supply in unaffected areas. However, the use of malaria deferral is clearly an incomplete approach [34] , failing to address risks associated with malaria-free areas and from autochthonous transmission in the United States or other non-endemic countries where competent vectors are established (e.g., as has been seen sporadically with dengue in the United States [35] ).",

Our response to dengue risk, or lack thereof, is informative of considerations used to address emerging pathogens. It is the most common human arboviral infection in the world (recent estimates suggest that more than 390,000,000 million infections occur annually) [36] . Human infections can range from asymptomatic to a lethal hemorrhagic fever. It is increasing in incidence worldwide, and transfusion transmission has been documented (albeit infrequently) [37] [38] [39] . Accordingly, dengue was labeled a priority agent in an AABB Transfusion-Transmitted Disease Committee exercise [11] . However, to date, no interventions are being seriously considered in the United States, beyond the requirement that donors be well when they are bled and what is contributed by malaria deferrals. For donors with risk for dengue from travel or outbreaks, who can be identified prior to donation, management strategies that temporarily restrict their donations or use (currently investigational) donor screening tests have been considered or used with variable costs and impacts on the availability of donors [40] [41] [42] [43] . Recent data, using nucleic acid amplification tests, suggest that the clinical burden after transfusion transmission may be quite modest and not require action [44] . In this study from Brazil, 16 susceptible transfusion recipients of blood from dengue RNA-positive donors were clinically indistinguishable from susceptible controls who did not. Five exposed recipients experienced probable dengue transmissions, and one was a possible infection. Surveillance for the clinical sequelae of transfusion transmission is clearly a priority as the blood community considers the relevance of this virus.",

However, during the recent pandemic, the occurrence of severe joint pain persisting for many weeks and months was recognized [45] . A mutation in the viral envelope protein allowed its adaptation to and high-level replication in the cosmopolitan vector Aedes albopictus [46] . Subsequently, the virus emerged from Africa as a pandemic that spread across the Indian Ocean, Asia, and the Pacific starting in 2005, reaching the Americas (St. Martin in the Caribbean) in late 2013 [38, 47] . The explosive (attack rate >30%) 2005-2006 epidemic on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean was met with suspension of the collection of red blood cells and plasma on the island, their importation from Metropolitan France, and the emergent introduction of pathogen reduction for platelets collected from local at-risk donors [48] . The virus can be transmitted by IV inoculation of monkeys [49] . Modeling exercises suggest a substantial risk of transmission by blood [50, 51] . Donor testing in the Caribbean using nucleic acid tests during 2014-2015 identified 0.19-0.54% of tested donors to be \"RNA-emic\" [52, 53] . The positive units were discarded if prospectively tested or de-linked, so recipient outcomes are not available.",

The occurrence of asymptomatic infection is obviously problematic, however [58] . Evidence for viremia is rarely sought but, where evaluated to date, has been confined to severely ill patients. The index patient in a family cluster in Tunisia in 2013 had viral sequences amplified by PCR from serum after more than a week of illness [66] . Another patient, with fatal infection, had sequences detected 4 weeks after onset of the illness, but was not apparently tested earlier [67] . In neither case was infectious virus sought. One hundred ten Saudi blood donors were seronegative for neutralizing antibodies [68] , but there are no systematic studies looking for asymptomatic RNAemia or viremia in higher-risk cohorts such as contacts of cases. The most recent formal WHO MERS-CoV risk assessment includes no mention of a risk from transfusion-transmitted infection [69] , nor does the European CDC rapid risk assessment of communicable diseases risk associated with the 2017 Hajj [70] . Given the low number of cases outside of the Middle East, and the apparent requirement for close contact with ill patients for person-to-person transmission to occur (esp. to healthcare workers), it does not appear that specific travel or risk deferrals are appropriate. Continuous monitoring (i.e., systematic \"horizon scanning\") for changes in the epidemiology and clinical pathology of MERS to be alert to changes that would suggest some risk of parenteral spread and transfusion risk seems an appropriate response.",

They are currently confined to South Asia and Australia (Fig. 10.2) [74] . Nipah is an emerging bat zoonosis, which spills over into humans to cause human infections ranging from inapparent to lethal encephalitis. It is an enveloped RNA virus sharing 70-90% amino acid homology across regions of the genome with Hendra virus. Nipah emerged in Malaysia in 1998-1999 where bats infected swine and the swine infected humans. During that outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness, there were approximately 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths [75, 76] . The clinical spectrum seems variable across geographically separate outbreaks. Treatment is supportive, but the antiviral ribavirin has been used in uncontrolled circumstances with some success. No effective prophylaxis (medication, immunoglobulin, or vaccine) has been reported. The human incubation period has ranged from 4 days to 2 months (90% \u226414 days), and there is, again, some variation according to the location of the outbreak. Direct contact with the respiratory secretions of infected swine that generally have a mild illness (apparently infected by consumption of mangoes contaminated with bat urine) was the source of the index outbreak. Bats of the genus Pteropus (\"flying foxes\") appear to be the natural reservoir and can infect a variety of mammalian secondary hosts (i.e., felines, canines, swine, and equines). An outbreak in Bangladesh was associated with the consumption of date palm sap, again contaminated by infected bats. Direct contact with infected bats may also result in transmission. Human-to-human transmissions, including family and healthcare associated, are documented. There is indirect evidence (i.e., lacking virus isolation or nucleic acid tests) of reactivation of latent, chronic infection resulting in recurrent CNS disease and death [77] [78] [79] .",

Horses are infected after contact with infected urine from Pteropus bats. A total of 53 outbreaks of equine respiratory illness involving more than 70 horses have all been confined to the northeast coast of Australia [81] . There is no evidence of the infection before its 1994 emergence after serological studies on a number of vertebrate and invertebrate repository samples. It causes a spectrum of human illness from nonspecific fever to flu-like syndromes to fatal encephalitis, generally as a consequence of spillover from equine infections. Treatment is supportive. No effective prophylaxis is available. The incubation period is from 5 to 21 days from exposure. Transmission to humans occurs mainly after direct contact during the care of sick horses or at the time of their autopsies. In early studies, recipient horses were infected intravenously using homogenates of the spleen and lung from two of the index horses. Postmortem lung, liver, kidney, and spleen from a human decedent were infectious in tissue culture [70] . In one case of CNS infection, the patient recovered but had recurrent neurological illness over a year later and died. There are no reports alleging transfusion transmission.",

The task for infectious diseases and epidemiology experts in the blood community is to be sensitive to this inevitability and to spend real effort anticipating which agents of many candidates pose material threats that bear forethought and planning. To that end, the emerging infections subgroup at AABB has engaged in developing a toolkit to guide that process (Fig. 10.3) . The most critical activity is \"horizon scanning\" that daily surveils a spectrum of online and print resources to identify new and emerging human pathogens. These include media reports, professional meetings, organizational and peer-reviewed publications, open source and subscription websites (e.g., ProMED [85] , CDC.gov, WHO.int, PAHO.org, and many others), and personal networks. Perhaps difficult element for horizon scanning is effective hemovigilance.

Online risk modeling tools to accomplish these analyses are being developed for transfusion medicine [88] , with the critical, if obvious, caveat that the precision of their output is wholly dependent on input parameters. These are necessarily least precise in the earliest stages of emergence when initial preparedness decisions must be made generally and specifically with regard to transfusion safety. There are critical data needed to inform any quantitative assessment of the importance of a potential pathogen. A \"routine\" search for and reports of the presence of the infectious agent (or the imperfect surrogates, nucleic acids, and antigens) in the blood of asymptomatic individuals at risk would be a valuable standard operating procedure during epidemiologic investigations of emerging infections; this does not often occur early and before the blood community must respond to a potential threat. Likewise, prospective determination of pathogen survival through contemporary component production, processing, and storage should be a research priority.",

They will range from information and education to donor queries and deferrals. For example, would it not be rational in the temperate world to consider a blanket travel deferral of several weeks for donors visiting tropical and subtropical venues where acute arthropod-borne and zoonotic agents are common? Donor testing and determining the role of pathogen reduction techniques are more aggressive responses to greater perceived risk. These considerations are all, necessarily, cyclic, iterative processes. The pivotal role of risk-based decision-making from a societal perspective is covered elsewhere in this book.",
