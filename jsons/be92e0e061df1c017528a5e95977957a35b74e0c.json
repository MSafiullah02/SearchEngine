Microarray detection is a good method, but requires complex procedures for multiple virus detection. Methods: We developed a novel PCR assay, the microar- ray-in-a-tube system, which integrates multiple PCR processes and DNA microarrays for multiple virus de- tection. A 5 \u060b 5 oligonucleotide microarray for detecting 4 respiratory tract viruses (severe acute respiratory syn- drome-associated coronavirus, influenza A virus, influ- enza B virus, and enterovirus) with inner controls was arranged on the inner surface of a specially designed Eppendorf cap with a flat, optically transparent window. Results: We were able to perform all detection processes in the encapsulated system without opening the cap. The 4 viruses were successfully amplified by one-step reverse transcription-PCR in the encapsulated tube. After the PCR process, the microarray-in-a-tube was inverted, and the fluorescence-labeled PCR products were directly hybridized on the microarray. Hybridiza- tion signals were obtained with an ordinary fluorescent microscope. The sensitivity of the system for virus detection reached 10 2 copies/L. With the help of inner controls, the system provided reliable results without false negatives and false positives. Conclusions: The microarray-in-a-tube system is a rapid, labor-saving tool for multiple virus detection with several advantages, such as convenience, preven- tion of cross-contamination of the PCR products, and potential for multiple-gene detection", "authors": [{"first": "Quanjun", "middle": [], "last": "Liu", "suffix": "", "affiliation": {}, "email": ""}, {"first": "Yunfei", "middle": [], "last": "Bai", "suffix": "", "affiliation": {}, "email": ""}, {"first": "Qinyu", "middle": [], "last": "Ge", "suffix": "", "affiliation": {}, "email": ""}, {"first": "Shixin", "middle": [], "last": "Zhou", "suffix": "", "affiliation": {}, "email": ""}, {"first": "Tian", "middle": [], "last": "Wen", "suffix": "", "affiliation": {}, "email": ""}, {"first": "Zuhong", "middle": [], "last": "Lu", "suffix": "", "affiliation": {}, "email": ""}]}, "abstract": [], "body_text": [{"text": "for use in epidemiology, food safety, and antiterrorism.

A sealed tube for nested-PCR and a 2nd PCR could be performed with a protocol including 2 separated gene amplifications to avoid cross-contamination (29 ) . The disadvantage, however, is that during the assays the amplicon could leak when detected by gel electrophoresis or hybridization analysis. With microelectromechanical system techniques, many other devices are able to prevent the vapor exchange during PCR amplification and DNA hybridization within a closed device (6 -8, 30 ) . These methods are inconvenient to perform, however, whereas the microarray-in-a-tube system was developed to enhance structural simplicity, labor savings, and low cost. In this system, all the steps from gene amplification to image capture could be performed in the sealed device. The system prevents cross-contamination because there is no gene amplicon leakage during any detection process. Asymmetrical RT-PCR production was added in an equal volume hybridization buffer for the 30-min hybridization. Images in A and B are fluorescence images before and after hybridization, respectively. The plots in C are fluorescence intensity before and after hybridization. After capturing the hybridization image, we calculated all the fluorescence intensities with in-house developed software. Three kinds of signal groups could be detected on the microarray for analyzing the reliability of the hybridization results. From the position signals we obtained the immobilized efficiency and the relative position of the probes. In general, because of the effect of hybridization efficiency, the fluorescence intensity of the position probes should be higher than that of hybridization probes. Therefore the fluorescence signals of the hybridization image were classified into 3 groups: the position signal, the negative signal, and the hybridization signals, which include inner control signals. All reliable results of fluorescent hybridization images should contain the above 3 signal groups. In the in-house developed software for the microarray-in-a-tube system, the fluorescence intensities were \u03fd5 for the negative result and \u03fe50 for the position marker. The fluorescence intensity of the inner positive control should be \u03fe20 and less than that of the position marker, otherwise the result should be discarded and the detection should be performed again.
