The word quarantine is derived from the French word quarantaine and is defined as \"1: a period of 40 days; 2a: a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore\" (Merriam Webster 2007). In human medicine quarantine has long served to isolate patients with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB1), measles, or influenza from the general population in order to prevent the spread of infectious agents. The development of infectious agents that are resistant to currently available antibiotics has seen a return of mandatory\u2014and controversial\u2014quarantine for public health reasons, such as the recent incarcerations of individuals with drug-resistant TB (Moszynski 2007) and of individuals traveling in Asia during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (CDC 2003a).",

Many of these imported NHPs were caught wild in their natural habitat (NAS 1970), a practice that provided a ready source of research animals but that also, because of the methods used at the time, resulted in high levels of morbidity and mortality among these animals. The stress of capture, transport, and exposure to human pathogens resulted in epizootics of infectious disease in newly imported populations (NAS 1973). Animals that were already immunocompromised from stress encountered novel viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents such as measles, Shigella, and tuberculosis (Kalter 1970), and were therefore subject to disease outbreaks that caused the loss of animals, poor animal quality, and compromised research programs (DeValois 1960; Kalter 1970). To address these problems, government programs and research facilities in the United States began developing conditioning programs in source countries as well as quarantine programs at facilities receiving animals to help detect the presence of infectious disease and prevent its spread in captive primate populations (NAS 1973; Whitney et al. 1967).",

A basic premise of animal management is the philosophy of \"all in and all out\" in which populations of animals are not mixed or combined with each other due to the risk of disease spread. Karl Habel in 1947 stated (referring to rhesus macaque importation) that \"All large groups of fresh stock should be left as homogeneous as possible. All animals in a room should be used before more are moved in\" and further recommended that \"New monkeys should be isolated and released into the colony only if they have passed two tuberculin tests one month apart\" (Habel 1947). Despite this advice, disease outbreaks occurred in domestic colonies as a result of the mixing of primate species in transit or inadequate biological separation of species at the receiving facility (DeValois 1960; Kalter 1970). The mixing of individuals of the same species but different geographic origins always has the potential to cause a disease outbreak, as different infectious agents may have a different prevalence in different populations (Hunt 1970; Kalter 1970). In addition, the exposure of na\u00efve young animals without maternal antibody protection resulted in rapid infection and spread in those populations.",

During the 1960s and early 1970s African species including baboons, vervets, and Patas monkeys were imported for infectious disease research; at the same time Asian species, predominantly macaques, were imported for other areas of primate research. A variety of disease outbreaks occurred in the imported Asian macaques after exposure to African primates. This experience soon led to the recognition that many African primate species carry a specific arterivirus, simian hemorrhagic fever. This highly infectious positive-strand RNA virus agent is easily transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, or fomites (Renquist 1990); it has an incubation of 3 to 7 days in aberrant hosts; and it results in a severe hemorrhagic crisis, leading to organ failure and death (Mansfield and King 1998). The mixing of primate populations of different provenance provided primate veterinarians with very dramatic examples of epizootics and added to researchers' knowledge of the presence of latent viruses in primate species.",

The focus of the new regulations, enacted on October 10, 1975, was primarily on the provision of a health certificate for animals from countries where yellow fever is endemic and on the requirement that animals be shipped in mosquito-resistant enclosures in order to exclude yellow fever vectors. The regulations also established basic quarantine requirements and required that the CDC be notified of the occurrence of Marburg virus, yellow fever, or monkeypox in any group of imported nonhuman primates (42 CFR 71.53).

CDC also established a Special Permit for Importation program with additional control measures (CDC 1990c) for the importation of rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, and African green monkeys (DeMarcus et al. 1999).

There are advantages and disadvantages to the number and size of quarantine rooms. Dividing quarantine shipments into subgroups housed in separate smaller rooms and treating them as isolated cohorts may provide the twin benefits of reducing the number of animals at risk in the event of a disease outbreak and limiting secondary spread of infection. But this benefit may be limited as quarantine will likely be extended for all animals in the shipment to account for the possibility that the entire shipment had direct contact immediately before shipment and therefore will have had the same pathogen exposure. Furthermore, smaller quarantine rooms decrease the space efficiency of the quarantine facility. Animal vivariums in general and quarantine rooms in particular are some of the most expensive research spaces to construct, and the additional walls, doors, and air handling equipment required by smaller rooms can dramatically increase the cost of the total square footage (Ruys 1990, 555-563).",

The development of rapid, cost-effective in vitro diagnostic assays of an infection with mycobacterial agents of significance is needed to improve the efficiency of nonhuman primate quarantine.
