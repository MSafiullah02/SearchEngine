In turn, the notion that these viral diseases likely have their ultimate ancestry in bats triggered a major increase in the sampling of bat viruses, leading to the progressive uncovering of a diverse bat virome and further fueling the idea that these animals are major reservoirs of emerging pathogens (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015; Young and Olival, 2016).",

Although RNA viruses commonly jump species boundaries, in part reflecting their ability to rapidly generate important adaptive variation (Geoghegan et al., 2017; Holmes, 2009; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005), coronaviruses (CoVs) seem to exhibit a strong zoonotic potential and demonstrated by the emergence SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Graham et al., 2013). Coronaviruses are single-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales that are classified in four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma and Deltacoronavirus. Among these, gamma and delta CoVs are largely associated with avian hosts, while alpha and beta CoVs include several pathogens of humans and domestic animals, and whose emergence is likely associated with cross-species transmission events (Drexler et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and are associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection characterized by mortality rates of 10% and 35%, respectively (Hu et al., 2015). The SARS pandemic was promptly controlled through an unprecedented global containment effort and the virus has not been reported in humans since May 2004 (Graham et al., 2013). Despite this rapid eradication, SARS-CoV caused almost 800 deaths in 27 countries, with sustained outbreaks in 18 countries on three continents (WHO). There is increasing evidence that rhinolophid bats act as natural reservoirs for SARS-related CoVs, with direct spill-over to non-flying mammals. For example, like the SARS coronavirus, some bat CoVs are able to utilize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor (Ge et al., 2014; Menachery et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016). Conversely, the role of bats in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is less well understood as the human viruses are clearly mostly related to those viruses found in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016). Indeed, although related viruses have been found in bats, these are divergent in their spike sequences and seem to be inefficient in the use of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as cell a receptor (Anthony et al., 2017a; Reusken et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014). The MERS epidemic is ongoing in the Middle East and travel-associated cases have been reported in 27 countries worldwide (WHO, 2017). Finally, Alphacoronavirus 229E and NL63, which cause a mild influenza-like syndrome in humans, share a common ancestor with viruses sampled from the bat genus Hipposideros and Triaenops, respectively (Corman et al., 2015, Corman et al., 2016; Tao et al., 2017).",

The long-term evolutionary interactions between bats and coronaviruses is also supported by phylogenetic evidence that CoVs exhibit some species- and genus-specific tropism (Cui et al., 2007; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007), and that phylogenetically related viruses are found in related bat species independent of sampling location. In contrast, that CoVs are not always shared among bat species that co-roost suggests that there are some barriers to cross-species transmission (Anthony et al., 2013; Corman et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2006).",

However, recent studies on specific bat taxa from particular locations suggests that the role of virus-host co-divergence in the evolutionary history of CoVs may have been overestimated relative to other events including host-jumping (Anthony et al., 2017b; Lin et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2017). Indeed, as well as strict virus-host co-divergence, topological congruence could also arise from preferential host switching, in which viruses most often successfully jump from closely related hosts (De Vienne et al., 2013). The analysis of the long-term evolutionary history of bat CoVs is also complicated by frequent multiple substitution at deep evolutionary distances that prevents the accurate estimation of divergence times (Wertheim et al., 2013).",

For example, across the CoVs as a whole, there were 0\u201311 co-divergence events compared to 38\u201347 host-shift events. Importantly, this result was independent of the cost associated with co-divergence (assigned as either equal or lower than that associated with cross-species transmission) and was the same when the alpha and beta CoVs were analyzed independently, such that there was no difference in the frequency of cross-species transmission between these viral groups.

In five cases, cross-species transmission events involved more than one highly similar CoV from the same recipient bat species. Up to six cross-species transmissions were recorded for a single donor host, with the highest frequency in clusters associated with the genera Miniopterus, Hipposideros and Rhinolophus (Table 5\n).

In only two cases did cross-species transmission involve related hosts from different geographical areas, namely phyllostomidae bats of the genera Carollia and Artibeus sampled in Costa Rica and Panama, respectively, and bats of the genera Miniopterus and Eptesicus from China and USA, both belonging to the superfamily Vespertilionoidea.

Our data indicate that bats are indeed associated with several distinct clusters of alpha and beta CoVs, and that most CoVs from non-flying mammals also fell within these clusters on phylogenetic trees. However, we also noted the existence of monophyletic groups of CoVs associated with mammalian species other than bats, such as Alphacoronavirus 1 and Betacoronavirus 1. Interestingly, we revealed a positive association between CoV diversity and the species richness and geographical distribution of samples from each bat genus, with more virus clusters in genera for which more species have been sampled across a wide geographic area, such as Myotis, Pipistrellus, Rhinolophus, and Hipposideros. This suggests that the high phylogenetic diversity of CoVs likely reflects the large number of different bat species and their global distribution (Fenton and Simmons, 2015; Woo et al., 2012), and supports the central role for these animals in CoV evolution. Furthermore, we detected a strong impact of sampling effort on CoV diversity, suggesting that this still likely underestimated in bats as a whole (Anthony et al., 2017b).",

Similarly, despite the evidence for geographical structuring, CoVs belonging to the same RGUs were also described in different locations, as previously described (Leopardi et al., 2016). Hence, as a general rule, CoVs exhibit genus-specificity rather than species-specificity. Conversely, CoV clusters associated with bat genera Pipistrellus and Eptesicus showed low divergence at the amino acid level based on the 816 bp fragment, suggesting their classification within the same CoV putative species.

Of particular note is the short length of most fragments of coronaviruses used for analyses, with less than half compressing the 816 bp necessary for RGU classification (Drexler et al., 2010), and which obviously limit phylogenetic resolution. Similarly, the uncertain classification of certain host species should not be underestimated, due to variable species assignments as well as the cryptic nature of several bat species that cannot be readily identified based on obvious morphological features but whose correct assignation often require the use of genetic or echolocation studies (Kingston et al., 2001) (Table S1). Indeed, the hosts included in our database represent only about 20% of the bat species (6% of the bat genera) described worldwide. Studies of CoV diversity have mainly been performed in China and Europe, while important hot spots for bat biodiversity (Richardson, 2002), such as South East Asia and Latin America, are under-represented. Furthermore, sequences collected from different areas are generally weakly representative for their specific continent with, for example, most African samples being collected from Ghana and Kenya (Fig. 1). While the reliability of our conclusions was confirmed by analyses performed on a much smaller data set with more accurate host assignments, we encourage a more comprehensive sampling, the collection of longer CoV sequences, and the accurate genetic attribution of the host species, all of which provide the information needed to better reveal the evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in bats.",

The tree reflects a Bayesian analysis of 935 bp of the RdRp gene (data set RdRp_CoV_1), rooted using two sequences from gamma coronaviruses (GenBank accession numbers EF584911-2). Genus specific clusters identified in our study are colored based on the host genus, as indicated. Posterior probabilities >0.90 supporting each cluster are shown. Branch lengths are scaled according to the number of substitutions per site. The three bars around the tree show the frequency within each cluster of (i) host genera, (ii) host species and (iii) sampling locations, from the innermost to the most exterior. Sequences showing characters with frequency < 10%, between 10 and 50%, and >50% are colored black, grey and light grey, respectively. For the \u201chost species\u201d bar, only sequences belonging to the host genus characterizing the cluster (frequency > 50%) have been colored; sequences associated with hosts only characterized at the genus level are indicated in yellow. The ICTV classification of virus clusters is indicated when available. The figure was generated using iTOL.",
