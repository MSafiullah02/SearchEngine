In the last few decades, increasing concerns about unfavorable outcomes associated with ABT, anticipation of future insufficient blood supply, and awareness of the cost (direct and indirect) of transfusion have led to the promotion of patient blood management (PBM) as a cost-effective strategy, beneficial for patients as well as for society (Shander et al. 2010). PBM programs utilize a series of measures with a proven ability to reduce ABT and to be cost-effective. Despite that the impact of PBM on patient clinical outcomes needs to be fully defined and future studies are needed, PBM should be adopted as a new standard of care.",

Acute reactions include acute hemolytic reactions, febrile nonhemolytic reactions, allergic reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and transfusion-related sepsis. Also, hyperkalemia, citrate toxicity, coagulopathy, and hypothermia may occur, especially in the case of massive transfusion. Delayed transfusion reactions include delayed hemolytic reactions, active immunization toward blood cell antigens, iron overload, transfusion-transmitted infections, autoimmunization and posttransfusion purpura, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease.",

Hemovigilance carries extremely important conclusions and recommendations but entails intrinsic limits. It essentially uses an incident-reporting methodology, where underreporting is common, since adverse effects may be not recognized or not ascribed to transfusion, or due to the lack of a rigorous reporting system. More importantly, some relevant adverse outcomes are not comprehended by an even well-established hemovigilance system but require large clinical studies for coming into light. On the basis of several observational studies and some RCTs, a causative relationship with transfusion has been shown for unfavorable outcomes, including higher mortality, more thrombotic events, organ dysfunction, infections, delayed wound healing, and increased length of hospital stay; transfusion has also been associated with cancer recurrence and insurgence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (for comprehensive reviews, see Vamvakas and Blajchman 2009; Shander et al. 2011). A dose relationship is present, but complications can be observed after administration of minimal amounts of RBC units (Rubinstein et al. 2013).",

For HBV the rate is slightly higher (around 1:200,000), because of the prolonged window period before serologic conversion and because of occult HBV infection (OBI), but further reduction is possible after the introduction of the triplex HBV/HCV/HIV NAT test in some countries (among which Italy) on the basis of HBV infection prevalence. In the last decade, west nile virus (WNV) has constituted a growing challenge for the blood bank system, forcing national authorities in North America and Europe to implement plans for either testing or referring donations, adapted on the base of national and/or local epidemiology reports. Dynamics of migrating populations and tourism are also taken into account as a possible source of infections by epidemiology control bodies, which blood management national authorities refer to. In this respect, reports of transmission through transfusion of newly emerging and reemerging infections, due to protozoan parasites (malaria, babesiosis, Chagas disease, etc.), viruses (dengue, chikungunya, influence strains, coronavirus, etc.), and prions (vCJD), are a matter of concern. Implementation of specific tests for infrequent infections is not an option for unacceptable cost/benefit ratio, and selection of donors has to be guided by up-to-date protocols.",

Operating a translation in our field, the \u201ctotal transfusion dependency ratio\u201d (TTDR; Hofmann et al. 2009) has been proposed, that is, non-donating population (aged <17 or >65 years), divided by donating population, multiplied by 100. Such index is suggestive since aged patients account for a large part of all RBC transfused (45 % for patients aged >70 years). In the recently past years, the TTDR was well less than 50 %, but a rapid climb is expected in the next 20 years, escalating over 55 % in several high-income countries (Farmer et al. 2013). In this perspective, a blood supply fulfilling even a steady request can no longer be taken for granted.",

When considering real costs of transfusion, a long series of activities involving material resources, technologies, and personnel both in transfusion service laboratories and in the wards (indirect costs) are to be taken into account. Through activity-based costing methodology (Shander et al. 2010), it has been calculated that on average, to transfuse a single RBC unit costs $726\u20131,183 in the USA and $522\u2013611 in Europe.",

In particular, among candidates for elective orthopedic surgery, one out of three to five is expected to be anemic at preadmission (Bierbaum et al. 1999; Saleh et al. 2007; Spahn 2010). Therefore, till recently, the presence of low-grade anemia has been accepted as a matter of facts, eventually to be corrected through the liberal use of RBC concentrates. Blood components were considered safe, quickly effective, readily available, and relatively inexpensive. As a consequence, preoperative anemia is a predictive factor for perioperative transfusion and still drives a relevant consumption of blood units (Khanna et al. 2003; Shander et al. 2004; Myers et al. 2004; Gruson et al. 2009), as much as 8 % for major orthopedic hip and knee surgery, in a study conducted in north England (Wells et al. 2002).",

            "text": "Oxygen supply is essential for aerobic metabolism, where it is employed in the process of extraction of energy from organic molecules. In multicellular, complex organisms, the atmospheric oxygen reaches the tissues by diffusing through specifically developed organs and vascular structures in a liquid system, that is, blood, from which it can diffuse in peripheral tissues. More complex organisms rely on a high-efficiency carrier for oxygen in the bloodstream, for at the atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen (21 %), the amount dissolved in the water solvent would not be sufficient for life. Therefore, in mammals, the presence of an adequate quota of oxygen in the inhaled air, anatomical and functional integrity of the lungs and its vascularization, and adequate blood flow and hemoglobin content are critical for the survival of cells. Even simple organisms have developed mechanisms for sensing reduction in oxygen delivery; in more complex organisms, oxygen sensors are multiple, existing in cells (hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF), organelle (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors), and organs (kidney). When hypoxia occurs, these mechanisms become activated, ultimately leading to the adaptive phenomena that we observe during blood loss and anemia. In acute anemia, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and hemoglobin-oxygen saturation (SaO2) are maximized by means of an increased ventilation and a more efficient ventilation/perfusion matching, occurring through a NO-mediated mechanism. The cardiovascular system undergoes fundamental modifications in response to acute normovolemic anemia: through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, after stimulation of vascular chemoreceptors, both heart rate and stroke volume are increased, the resulting cardiac output (CO) augmented up to threefold in the presence of intact adaptive mechanisms. Moreover, vasodilation occurs, determining a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Importantly, regional differences in CO are established, through differentiated degrees of vasodilation; thus, vital organs are initially preserved, the heart and the brain receiving a higher proportion of CO. Instead, the kidney appears to have a lower margin for compensation and becomes injured earlier, insomuch as hemoglobin concentration drops below 7 g/dl, during cardiac surgery (Habib et al. 2003; Karkouti et al. 2005). Increased CO is also related to reduced blood viscosity and increased venous return, associated with vasoconstriction in the splanchnic district. The relevance of adrenergic activation as a compensative mechanism is highlighted by what has been considered a paradoxical effect of \u03b2-blockade during blood loss, that is, an increased rate of perioperative myocardial infarction (van Klei et al. 2009) and stroke (Devereaux et al. 2008), following administration of adrenergic antagonists. Another compensative mechanism for tissue hypoxia is an increased peripheral oxygen extraction, consequent to lowered hemoglobin-oxygen affinity (for increased 2,3-DPG, reduced pH, and NO-mediated events) and overall enlarged capillary bed. On the other hand, some organs reduce their oxygen demand, in front of an increase in consumption by the myocardium.",

Possible strategies therefore include measures aimed to increase DO2 and possibly to reduce VO2. Since DO2 = CaO2 \u00d7 CO (where CaO2 is the arterial oxygen content), a feasible approach to increase CaO2 is hyperoxic ventilation, with the aim to maximize the amount of the gas physically dissolved in plasma that can become a relevant quota available for tissue oxygenation in the presence of low Hb concentrations. To support CO, inotropic drugs are used in acute normovolemic anemia. On the other hand, a reduced oxygen demand can be obtained with neuromuscular blockade, as well as induction of anesthesia. Depth of anesthesia also affects anemia tolerance, but handling this tool is not commonly practicable (see Meier and Gombotz 2013).",

It is difficult to argue against the overall beneficial outcomes of a program encompassing several measures, all aimed to reduce ABT, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. Nevertheless, although the effects of single measures are mostly known, we cannot really anticipate the effect of a complex of measures, possibly being addictive, synergistic, or even paradoxically counteracting. Studies involving a large population are needed in order to address this question, in the form of CRTs, targeting clinically relevant outcomes, or in the form of registries collecting safety and effectiveness data on patients managed in a PBM program (Gross et al. 2013). So far, initiatives involving local institutions have demonstrated the feasibility of implementing PBM programs, achieving extremely relevant goals such as fewer transfusion administered, reduced mortality and complications, lenght of stay (LOS), readmissions, and costs (Kotz\u00e9 et al. 2012; Leahy et al. 2012). A recently published study (So-Osman et al. 2014a), combining restrictive transfusion thresholds, erythropoietin administration, and/or autologous blood reinfusion, reports effectiveness (but not cost-effectiveness) of erythropoietin administration, but it shows lack of benefit for cell salvage/drain reinfusion in patients with Hb levels 10\u201313 g/dl.",

When a diagnosis is made of functional iron deficiency, iron sequestration, or mixed anemia, IV iron therapy may be necessary, particularly in the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, because of inhibition of gastrointestinal absorption caused by increased hepcidin levels. At present, IV iron is included in guidelines as a recommended pharmacological measure aimed to reduce transfusion rate (Leal-Noval et al. 2013). Several formulations are available for IV use, currently for different anemic conditions. High-molecular-weight iron dextran (HMWD) should be abandoned in favor of low-molecular-weight iron dextran (LMWD), for a lower rate of adverse reactions. Ferric gluconate and iron sucrose are formulations widely used in chronic kidney disease, but adverse effects are not rare. The recently introduced ferumoxytol does not require dilution for slow IV use, in contrast to iron sucrose and sodium ferric gluconate. Ferric carboxymaltose and iron isomaltoside, still in the course of study for some applications, are proposed, as well as ferumoxytol, for total dose infusion, that is, a slow infusion of 1\u20131.5 g. The European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP; 2013) has emanated new recommendations to manage risk of allergic reactions with intravenous iron-containing medicines indicating that IV iron medicines are used when iron supplements given by mouth cannot be used or do not work and staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions must be immediately available, as well as resuscitation facilities. Moreover, the utility of test dose is underscored, and a 30-min period of observation after infusion is prescribed.",

In particular, in many European countries, ESA preoperative use is not approved, unless preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) is scheduled. More recently, following post-approval clinical trials, targeting risk of thrombotic adverse effects of ESAs, and overall increased rate of morbidity and mortality, limits for their use have been indicated, in respect to Hb levels and an appropriate antithrombotic prophylaxis, by regulatory agencies.",

In the course of a PABD program, 5 units can be produced with a timing compatible with storage and use during surgery (Goodnough et al. 1992). Most effective dosage and timing of administration are debated, and diverse schedules are used. Low doses of erythropoietin (400 U/kg over a 2-week period) are sufficient to exert a significant stimulus on erythropoiesis (Sans et al. 1996). Even a single administration of erythropoietin plus iron, 1 day before surgery, has been found to be effective in reducing the need in ABT in cardiac surgery (Yoo et al. 2011). Aggressive schedules are employed in the course of a PABD program, when the RBC mass produced on a 3-week period, directly related to erythropoietin dosage, can be anticipated: RBC volume (ml per kg) = 6.34 + 0.0013X, where X equals the total units of erythropoietin administered, per kg body weight (Goodnough et al. 1994).

Indeed, PABD programs in major orthopedic surgery have caused a reduction in risk of ABT (Rosencher et al. 2003; Carless et al. 2004). Greater effectiveness is obtained when a PABD program is integrated with treatment with an ESA. Yet, the overall risk of transfusion is increased, entailing an increased risk of clerical errors as well as some kind of complication also presented by PABD (TACO, fever and chills, infections, possibly immunomodulation). These and other disadvantages (over-collection, outdating, wasting) are to be taken into account in order to evaluate PABD cost/benefit ratio. The British Committee for Standards in Hematology (2007) emanated internationally recognized guidelines that do not recommend PABD unless specific conditions are present. In particular, patients still considerable candidate for PABD are children with scoliosis, patients who refuse transfusion but would consent to PABD, bearers of rare blood groups, or who are poly-immunized. A PABD program, in combination with blood salvage, may be beneficial in bilateral TKA (Boettner et al. 2009).",

Further studies are needed in order to target relevant clinical outcomes.\n",
