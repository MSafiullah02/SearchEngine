Case 1 involved a 61-year-old man who was the owner of a farm that he visited regularly. The patient had substantial contact with animals including camels, sheep, pigeons, and hens, and no history of travel outside of Qatar in the 2 weeks before becoming ill. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed by E gene (upE) PCR on a sputum sample collected on Oct 13, 2013, in the National Virology Laboratory of Qatar. Case 2 involved a 23-year-old male employee of the farm owned by case 1 and was identified in the close-contact investigation of that case. He was reported on Oct 17, 2013, and had no underlying medical conditions and no recent travel history, but had regular contact with the animals on the farm. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed in a throat swab taken on Oct 17, 2013, by the National Virology Laboratory of Qatar. Diagnosis for both cases was confirmed (ORF1b and N gene PCR) by Public Health England.15, 16 Qatari authorities, with support from WHO, did an epidemiological investigation at the farm within 1 week of diagnosis of the first case, which included the collection of various clinical samples from the farm's dromedary camels. Full details of the outbreak investigation will be described elsewhere.",

The sample collection was done jointly by the Communicable Disease Control Outbreaks Rapid Response Team of the Public Health Department and the Animal Health Team, which used full personal-protective equipment including N95 masks, goggles, disposable gowns, gloves, and head covers during the handling of the animals, and during the environmental and human sampling. Serum samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C and all other samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and were shipped to the Netherlands on dry ice. We tested nose swabs with two independent RT-PCR targets specific for MERS-CoV (upE and nucleocapsid [N gene]) in one laboratory (Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands), and did RT-PCR testing with a third target (ORF1a) in another laboratory (National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, Netherlands).",

However, virological testing was unable to detect MERS-CoV viral sequences in camels, probably because only faecal and serum samples were analysed. In addition, shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV in camels (and human beings) are unknown, and therefore, interpretation of negative RT-PCR results from screening is difficult because positive and negative predictive values remain to be determined.22\nPanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed for articles published in English up to Dec 1, 2013, with the search terms \u201cnovel coronavirus EMC\u201d or \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d. We identified 121 reports linked to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Our study provides proof that MERS-CoV has infected dromedary camels in Qatar. Our results suggest the simultaneous occurrence of a MERS-CoV outbreak in people and camels. On the basis of the present data, we cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa.

Another possibility is that people and camels were infected from a third as yet unknown source. Although additional sequencing might provide improved resolution, it probably will not provide conclusive evidence. The most important unknown is the exact timing of infections, both in the infected people and camels. If the virus entered the farm through either the people or the camels, the infections observed would probably have resulted from a chain of transmissions that introduced mutations.",

A more detailed analysis of the outbreak, including testing of additional animals and environmental samples is ongoing, as are attempts to obtain full MERS-CoV genomes of the human and animal specimens. We cannot exclude the possibility that other common livestock species including cattle, sheep, and goats, or other animals including wild species were involved in the spread of MERS-CoV. While confirmation of the source is awaited, we recommend that a detailed case history is taken of any cases of MERS-CoV, including review of any animal exposures (including animal products), and targeted (prospective) serosurveys to determine what risk factors are associated with human infection.",
