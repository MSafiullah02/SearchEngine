BCoV, which causes diarrhoea in newborn calves, winter dysentery in adult calves and respiratory tract illnesses in calves and adult cattle, inflicts in severe economic losses on the global farming industry (Azizzadeh, Shooroki, Kamalabadi, & Stevenson, 2012; BOK et al., 2015; Johnson & Pendell, 2017).",

            "text": "Bovine coronavirus possesses five major structural proteins: the spike (S), hemagglutinin/esterase (HE), nucleocapsid (N), transmembrane (M) and the small membrane (E) (Lai & Cavanagh, 1997). The S protein is involved in receptor recognition and carries distinct functional domains near its amino (S1) and carboxy (S2) termini, while the N\u2010terminal S1 domains recognize sugar receptors, and the S2 subunit is a transmembrane protein that mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion during cell invasion (Fang Li, 2016). S1 and S2 contain several antigenic domains, but S1 appears to be the most efficient at inducing antibodies with high neutralizing activities in its host (Yoo & Deregt, 2001). The HE protein contains two important functional domains: the lectin domain and the esterase domain. The lectin domain recognizes sugar receptors in the cell, whereas the esterase domain possesses a receptor\u2010destroying enzyme activity capable of removing cellular receptors from the surfaces of the targeted cells. The receptor\u2010binding (lectin) and receptor\u2010destroying (esterase) domains may be important for virus entry (Kienzle, Abraham, Hogue, & Brian, 1990; Schultze, Wahn, Klenk, & Herrler, 1991). Therefore, in addition to the S protein, the HE protein serves as a second viral attachment protein for infection initiation (Groot, 2006). The primary role of BCoV N protein is to package the viral genome into long, flexible, helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, protect the genome and ensure its timely replication and reliable transmission, as well as playing a role in viral transcription and translation (Hurst, Ye, Goebel, Jayaraman, & Masters, 2010). In contrast, the M protein plays a crucial role in BCoV assembly (Oostra, Haan, Groot, & Rottier, 2006).",

            "text": "The high genetic diversity in coronaviruses is attributable to the high mutation rates associated with RNA replication, the high recombination frequencies within the coronavirus family and the large coronavirus genomes (Woo, Lau, Huang, & Yuen, 2009). Recombination in coronaviruses plays an important role in virus evolution and can result in the emergence of new pathotypes (Menachery, Graham, & Baric, 2017; Wang et al., 2015) as well as changing the host ranges and ecological niches (Bakkers et al., 2017). Thus far, recombination regions in coronaviruses have been extensively reported for the S gene (Kin et al., 2015; Lau et al., 2011; Minami et al., 2016), a finding also applicable to BCoV (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012). Recombination events in M (Herrewegh, Smeenk, Horzinek, Rottier, & Groot, 1998), N (Kin et al., 2015), RP3 (Lau et al., 2010) and the ORF1 gene (Chen et al., 2017; Kin et al., 2015) have also been reported. However, to date, recombination events in HE have only been reported in MHV, a betacoronavirus, and this situation may act as a strong force for generating strains with new genotypes, host spectra and tissue tropisms (Groot, 2006; Luytjes, Bredenbeek, Noten, Horzinek, & Spaan, 1988; Smits et al., 2005).",

In China, the prevalence of BCoV is still largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we screened 190 diarrhoea faecal samples from calves, 36 of which were found to be BCoV\u2010positive, and the positive samples were distributed across 13 of the 14 farms we screened across six provinces in the major dairy cattle production areas of China. The results showed that BCoV is circulating widely in these dairy cattle, a finding that should help with the diagnosis and control of diarrhoea in these animals. Most of the strains from this study are unique in their evolutionary histories based on our analysis of the full\u2010length S, HE, N and M genes, a finding similar to that for BCoV in Korean (Ko et al., 2006; Park et al., 2010). This may be the result of geographical, environmental and natural selection patterns (Bidokhti et al., 2013; Hasoksuz, Sreevatsan, Cho, Hoet, & Saif, 2002; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The BCoV S protein is involved in receptor recognition, host specificity, antigenic diversity and immunogenicity (Fang Li, 2016). Its gene sequences are variable, and mutations in this protein are associated with alterations in viral antigenicity, viral pathogenicity, host range and tissue tropism (Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Peng et al., 2012). In this study, compared with other BCoV S genes, we found that nine out of 13 of our sequences and 13 Chinese BCoV sequences (one strain from cattle and 12 strains from Yaks), which clustered on a large independent branch of the phylogenetic tree, each had an identical aa variant (N1192Y) in the S2 subunit. As a transmembrane protein, the S2 subunit mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Luo & Weiss, 1998); hence, the biological significance of this variant warrants further investigation. In addition, four out of 13 sequences and 12 sequences from Chinese Yaks were found to have an identical aa variant (E121V) in the S1 receptor\u2010binding region, compared with the other S genes. The S1 subunit in the N\u2010terminal of BCoV (aa 1\u2013330) recognizes a sugar receptor (Peng et al., 2012), and aa substitutions in this region can change the receptor\u2010binding capacity (Li et al., 2005) and host receptor specificity (Sheahan et al., 2008). Two BCoV strains (GenBank accession number MK095177 and MK095178) from Shanxi Province were found to have unique aa substitutions (E1051V, S1076P) in the heptad repeat region. This region is crucial for viral entry and for viral and host cell membrane interactions to occur, and it promotes lipid bilayer fusion and nucleocapsid release into the cytoplasm (Forni et al., 2015). Thus, aa substitutions in this region may affect the interaction between the coiled\u2010coil structure and the host cell receptor (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012). The HE protein has a receptor\u2010binding function, which also plays a critical role in the infection process of BCoV (Langereis, Zeng, Heesters, Huizinga, & Groot, 2012). The BCoV HE receptor\u2010binding region comprises six surface loops, among which five are grafted onto the beta\u2010sandwich core of the lectin domain, named the R1\u2010loop, R2\u2010loop, R3\u2010loop, R4\u2010loop and the RBS\u2010hairpin, and another is present on the esterase domain (E\u2010loop; Langereis et al., 2012). In our study, 10 of the 13 strains were identified as having the same recombination events in the HE gene, located between the esterase and lectin region (Figure 5); this recombination phenomenon may affect receptor\u2010binding capacity.",

Moreover, these strains each had an identical aa variant (F181V) in the R2\u2010loop of the HE gene, while nine of the 10 recombinant strains had another identical aa variant (P, S158A) in the adjacent R1\u2010loop of the HE gene and this variant differs from all other available BCoV HE sequences in GenBank, and these recombinant strains clustered into a large independent branch in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). The 10 recombinant strains were recovered from eight farms in four provinces across a wide geographical distance, with the two furthest provinces being more than 1,000 km apart. Thus, these novel HE recombinant strains have been circulating widely in dairy cattle in China. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a recombination event in the HE gene from BCoV in cattle, a finding that augments current understanding about the evolution of BCoV. In fact, MHV, which is another lineage A member of the betacoronavirus genus, has also reportedly undergone a non\u2010homologous recombination event in the HE gene (Luytjes et al., 1988). Recombination in the HE gene from Influenza C virus and in toroviruses has also been observed (Groot, 2006; Smits et al., 2005). Recombination in the HE gene may be a strong driving force for generating strains with new genotypes, host spectra and tissue tropisms (Groot, 2006; Luytjes et al., 1988; Smits et al., 2005). Notably, in our study, the HE recombinant and non\u2010recombinant strains simultaneously existed on the same cattle farm in Liaoning Province.",

The most common betacoronavirus HE receptor is 9\u2010O\u2010acetylated sialic acid (9\u2010O\u2010Ac\u2010Sia; Matrosovich, Herrler, & Klenk, 2013). However, the MHV\u2010S receptor is 4\u2010O\u2010Ac\u2010Sia, not 9\u2010O\u2010Ac\u2010Sia, and this change may be caused by aa substitutions and/or insertions in the receptor\u2010binding region of the HE lectin domain, as compared with the Mebus BCoV prototype strain (Langereis et al., 2012). The HE protein lectin domain recognizes the sugar receptor, and the R2\u2010loop in the lectin domain (residues 176\u2013185) plays an important role in ligand binding; aa substitutions in this region may reduce receptor\u2010binding activity (Bakkers et al., 2017). In the present study, all the strains with recombination in HE share an identical aa variant (F181V) in the R2\u2010loop of the HE gene. Furthermore, nine of the 10 strains have another identical aa variant (P, S158A) in the adjacent R1\u2010loop of their HE genes, which is an identical situation to that seen with the HCoV\u2010OC43 (Bakkers et al., 2017). Thus, further investigation of the significance of the receptor\u2010binding capacity caused by aa substitutions in the receptor\u2010binding region of the HE recombinant strains is warranted.",

In this study, the high prevalence of the HE recombinant strain was found in China, which has a significant implication on BCoV vaccine development subsequently in China. It is also interesting to further investigate the protective effect of the vaccine developed by BCoV prototype strain on the HE recombinant strain of BCoV. In this study, we made efforts to isolate the recombinant strain using HRT\u20108 cell. Unfortunately, we failed. It may be caused by repeated freeze\u2010thaw of samples when they were used for detecting other enterovirus before the detection of BCoV.
