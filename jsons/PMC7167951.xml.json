It has been considered that apoptosis in the hippocampus occurs as a result of immune\u2010triggered bystander effects during the course of infection,6, 7, 8 which has been indicated by our previous report2 showing that the viral antigens in the hippocampus are mainly found in the CD11b\u2010positive cells distributed in the stratum oriens located outside the pyramidal layer, and only a few pyramidal neurons are infected. Furthermore, the apoptotic cells, indicated as showing caspase 3 (Cas3) activation, consist of a high number of uninfected cells. Such bystander effects causing pyramidal cell apoptosis are also observed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).9 The bystander effects are considered to be the result of elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines detected in the course of diseases, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1,7, 8, 9 IL\u20106,8 IL\u20101\u03b27 and MCP\u20101.4 Therefore, we examined the local expression of several kinds of proinflammatory cytokines including those reportedly associated with hippocampal damage. However, the distribution of proinflammatory cytokines after infection with Mu\u20103 did not correspond with that of subregional lesions in CA2 and CA3 induced by Mu\u20103 infection.",

Intensive cell infiltration, leading to a dense population of monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mas), is only observed in the meninges during the early phase of infection.1, 10, 12 Furthermore, it has been indicated that the immunosuppressive state after infection is mediated by expression of the Lewis X (Lex) carbohydrate structure13 using mutant mice that lack \u03b11,3\u2010fucosyltransferase 9 (Fut9\u2212/\u2212) and are unable to synthesize the Lex structure.14 Our study comparing wild\u2010type and Fut9\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated that leukocytes derived from infected wild\u2010type mice were unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, whereas those from Fut9\u2212/\u2212 mice responded to the challenge, although the stimulation of leukocytes derived from the two strains through Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 9 similarly caused high\u2010level responses.10, 15 The immunosuppressive state observed in the wild\u2010type mice after infection mimics the state in endotoxin tolerance (ET), or LPS tolerance, known as a classic example of a protective mechanism to prevent an excessive inflammatory response.16 The state of ET is mediated by suppressor cells, which are a Gr\u20101\u2010 and CD11b\u2010positive (Gr\u20101+ CD11b+) population of Mo/Mas.16\n",

The injection of medium into the frontal lobe led to higher\u2010level responses in the hippocampus than viral infection, which is typically observed as elevated levels of type I interferons (IFN\u2010I) and TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Fig. 1a). In the pons, such dissociation was not seen, and relatively higher\u2010level responses were observed on viral infection compared with sham infection (Fig. 1b), as has been reported on srr7 infection.13 These rather conflicting data obtained from the measurement of cytokines of total tissues, which has been the major method to show the contribution of cytokines to induce hippocampal damage, described in the Introduction, led us to study the local production of cytokines by immunofluorescence at 3 dpi. This time, no tissue damage in the hippocampus was found (Supplemental Fig. 1A), as previously reported,2 and no viral antigens were detected in the hippocampus (Supplemental Fig. 1B), as previously reported.2 Furthermore, most of the cytokine production after sham infection subsided (Fig. 1a). At 4 dpi, tissue destruction starts in the hippocampus,2 which would trigger the production of cytokines not involved in pyramidal cell apoptosis as causative cytokines. However, no proinflammatory cytokine examined showed expression localized in the CA2 and CA3 subregions at 3 dpi. IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 were detected in the CA1 and CA2 subregions.

The failure to detect cytokines in the tissue extracts with the multiplex bead\u2010based immunoassay, in spite of their local expression being detected by tissue immunostaining, is due to their more sensitive assessment by the latter compared with the former, shown in our previous study.17 The level of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in the supernatant of peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) culture was undetectable after Mu\u20103 infection when measured by the multiplex bead\u2010based immunoassay, although, by immunostaining of cultured PECs after infection, IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010producing cells were detected at a distance from infected cells. Nevertheless, the multiplex bead\u2010based immunoassay revealed that the infection inhibited productions of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus compared with the pons. The levels of cytokines measured in the pons might be a reflection of intensive and moderate inflammatory cell invasion in the meninges and fourth ventricle adjacent to the pons, respectively.10, 12, 22 The hippocampus can be more sensitive, hence more vulnerable, to external stress4, 23 than other areas of the brain, leading to elevated levels of cytokines in the hippocampus of sham\u2010infected mice at 2 dpi. The response observed on sham\u2010infection, which did not induce anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus at a detectable level, might have been suppressed by viral infection. Viruses have evolved various strategies to circumvent the innate immune response,24 and coronaviruses are known to block type I IFN (IFN\u2010I) signaling and counter the action of downstream effector molecules.25 Our findings indicate that the production of many proinflammatory cytokines other than IFN\u2010I is also suppressed in the brain by Mu\u20103 infection.",

The same question arose when we detected IL\u201010 expression in the hippocampus at 3 dpi. Furthermore, it was the pyramidal neurons that expressed IL\u201010 and not CD11b\u2010positive Mo/Mas, which can migrate into the hippocampus. The failure of the production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines by Mo/Mas or microglia after infection was also detected by the brain primary culture, where a large population of CD\u201011b\u2010positive cells are found,20 although we have shown, for the first time, that coronaviral infection can trigger the production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines by Mo/Mas in PECs within 8 h post\u2010infection (hpi).17 The answer to the question of how information on infection reaches the hippocampus is provided by our previous reports.20, 22 As early as 12 hpi with cl\u20102, a unique reticular network (RN) is formed in the meninges, ventricle, ventricular wall, and brain surface facing the meninges, which extends deep into the brain parenchyma with an association with astrocytic fibers within 48 hpi.22 The fibers of the RN (RNfib) are positive for antigens, such as collagen, laminin, and ER\u2010TR7 antigen (ERag), the most important marker of the fibroblastic RN (FRN) in lymphoid organs. The fibers of FRN in the lymphoid organs contain collagen fibers as a core, which is wrapped by an ERag\u2010positive extracellular matrix (ECM), and further by a basement membrane enriched with laminin.26 The FRN functions as a conduit system, transferring substances such as cytokines and antigens to facilitate immune responses, and guiding the homing of leukocytes.27 The RN in the brain, referred to as astrocytic RN (ARN),20 could have quickly transferred the information about the viral invasion to the cells deep in the brain parenchyma, like FRN does in the lymphoid organs. In addition, cell\u2010to\u2010cell\u2010mediated cross\u2010talk, like that occurring through an immune synapse formed between lymphoid cells,28 using either immune\u2010related or non\u2010immune\u2010related molecules such as neurotransmitters,29 might contribute to transmit the signal from the infected site to neurons in the hippocampus in order to produce IL\u201010.",

Among domestic cells in the CNS, astrocytes that produce IL\u201010 are found in chronic active lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS).34 Using the cell line PC12, it was shown that neuronal cells are capable of producing IL\u201010 in vitro under a hypoxic state, which causes apoptosis of the cells in vitro as well as pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in vivo.\n35 The blocking of the cascade to produce IL\u201010 reduces the apoptosis.35 It is an important issue whether IL\u201010 production by neurons is involved in neuronal apoptosis, because the anti\u2010inflammatory function of IL\u201010 is considered as a therapeutic tool to handle an autoimmune state in the CNS.34\n",
