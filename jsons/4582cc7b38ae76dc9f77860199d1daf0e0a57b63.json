Indeed, 2D cell cultures have contributed tremendously to the investigation of infectious disease etiology, the immune mechanisms used to defend against human viruses Barrila et al., 2010) , and especially the biochemistry and molecular biology of viral replication (Andrei, 2006) . However, 2D monolayer culture has significant restrictions in mimicking the physiological complexity of the in vivo microenvironment that is encountered by pathogens; this model cannot accurately reproduce the natural infection process (Barrila et al., 2010) . In addition, due to the lack of suitable cell culture models, the study of the life cycle of fastidious viruses and virus-host interactions has been hampered (Lindenbach et al., 2005; Sainz et al., 2009a) . Furthermore, animal models are costly and their use has ethical issues (Page et al., 2013) . A multitude of pathogens are species specific, and the pathogenesis mechanisms cannot be captured by time-consuming animal models (Griffith and Swartz, 2006) . As an example, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in animal models seldom progressed to lethality, however, it may cause death in people (Louz et al., 2013) .",

Cells grown on 3D culture systems can differ considerably in their morphology, viability, signaling control, gene expression, differentiation, proliferation and drug sensitivity in comparison with those grown on flat 2D tissue substrates (Friedl et al., 2012; Edmondson et al., 2014; Antoni et al., 2015) . For example, Matrigel-cultured Huh7 cells assemble into 3D spheroids, whereas standard 2D-cultured cells form epithelial monolayers (Molina-jimenez et al., 2012) . Cells cultured in a 3D matrix can adequately reproduce the function of 3D tissues and mimic cell-cell and cellmatrix interactions in vivo. 3D culture systems have been designed to allow investigation of infectious pathogens, such as human viruses, bacteria and parasites.

Cells grown in a 3D environment more closely represent normal cellular characteristics and biological function that the traditional 2D monolayer culture cannot provide. For example, cells cultured in a 3D matrix can adequately reproduce the function of 3D tissues and mimic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that affect proliferation, differentiation, morphology and a range of cellular functions in vivo, which are lost in conventional 2D conditions (Mazzoleni et al., 2009) . The classic polarized patterns of signaling that guide migration in 2D models are not essential for efficient migration in 3D models . Almost all cells use lamellipodia to migrate on 2D substrates, however, multiple modes of migration are observed in three dimensions, including lamellipodial, lobopodian, amoeboid migration (Madsen and Sahai, 2010; and collective migration (Friedl and Alexander, 2011) .

In addition, some emerging 3D culture models can allow nutrients and metabolites to be transported in and out of the 3D cells (Li and Cui, 2014) . Although current 3D systems provide unique mechanistic insights into cell-microenvironment interaction, most 3D models do not replicate all complex physiological features of real-tissue in vivo. They often lack the normal vasculature, normal transport of small molecules, host immune responses, internal tissue tensions, tissue heterogeneity and fluid flows observed in vivo. In addition, those models cannot precisely replicate biochemical composition, gradients of soluble regulatory factors and other microenvironment factors in vivo (Yamada and Cukierman, 2007; Grinnell and Petroll, 2010; Baker and Chen, 2012; Friedl et al., 2012) . Moreover, more complex architectures are found in tissues in vivo, such as orthogonally arranged collagen sheets and collagen fibril bundles. However, the most current methods to prepare 3D fibrillar matrices result in matrices in which fibrils lack any particular organization or become aligned uniaxially (Grinnell and Petroll, 2010) .

Consequently, it has been applied extensively in reproducing the key elements of malignant tumor behavior (Hamilton, 1998) . Traditional and newer techniques have been investigated for spheroid production. First, the spinner flask method, which prevents cell attachment to the vessel surface and promotes cell-cell contacts via constant stirring. This method is relatively simple and produces massive spheroids, suitable for high-throughput testing, but has a high shear force and variability in cell size/number (Lin and Chang, 2008; Breslin and O'driscoll, 2013) . Second, the hanging drop method depends on gravity forces to form spheroids on inverted substrates (Kelm et al., 2003) . This method is inexpensive and suitable for highthroughput testing, and the spheroid size can be con-trolled; however, it is labor intensive and mass production is limited (Lin and Chang, 2008) . Third, liquid overlay culture, which prevents the attachment of cells to tissue culture plates and promotes spheroid formation (Achilli et al., 2012) . Although this method is easy to set up, rapid and makes screening easy, the size and shape of the spheroids are heterogeneous. Fourth, a rotating-wall vessel (RWV) creates a microgravity that supports cells in suspension and promotes cell aggregation into spheroids. This method allows good control of the microenvironment over time (Achilli et al., 2012) . In addition, pellet culture 3D scaffolds can also form MCSs, especially with micro-fluidics and the magnetic cell levitation method, which were developed in recent years to create new opportunities to form spheroids (Kim et al., 2013) .",

To overcome these problems, the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Johnson Space Center developed the RWV (Goodwin et al., 1992) , which provides a low fluid-shear environment and minimal turbulence that promotes cell growth and randomized gravitational vectors (Goodwin et al., 1993) .

In recent years, several novel 3D culture models have been developed for further studying human tissue pathophysiology and physiology in vitro. Microfluidic 3D cell culture allows spatial control over fluids in micrometer-sized channels. This model has become a valuable tool to further increase the physiological relevance of 3D cell culture by enabling spatially controlled co-cultures, perfusion flow and spatial control over signaling gradients. van Duinen et al. (2015) have reviewed the most important progress in microfluidic 3D cell culture since 2012. Using hydrogels in microfluidic systems have been a recent trend, this model offers cells a more physiologically relevant 3D matrix (Huang et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2012) . The microfluidics 3D system will play an important role in the development of personalized medicine, especially in the field of cancer. In addition, 3D perfusion cell culture, an emerging technology, may provide a potential research avenue for commercial applications in drug discovery, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. This model, mimicking the blood circulation in the human body, can control physiological chemostatic conditions, and create gradients of oxygen, growth factors and other biochemical signals. The 3D perfused culture model also can maintain the stability of the local microenvironment of the residing cells by continuously providing a nutrient supply and waste removal (Li and Cui, 2014) . Souza et al. (2010) reported a novel 3D tissue culture based on magnetic cells levitation. In this method, cells bind with a magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle assembly comprising gold nanoparticles and cell-adhesive peptide sequences. By spatially controlling the magnetic field, cells are concentrated at the airliquid interface, where they aggregate to form larger 3D cultures (Haisler et al., 2013) . The magnetic levitation method (MlM) and other associated techniques (cell culture, imaging and IHc) adapted for the MlM are described by Haisler et al.(2013) .",

            "text": "Organotypic epithelial raft cultures represented a breakthrough in the study of papillomaviruses due to the strict link of HPV replication with epithelial cell differentiation (Andrei et al., 2010) . So far, more than nine aspects of HPVs have been explored in these systems. HPV cannot be propagated in 2D cell monolayer cultures, so organotypic epithelial raft cultures that generate a stratified and differentiated epithelium have been applied in studying the HPV life cycle (Chow, 2015) . The organotypic raft culture system has allowed the study of the en-tire differentiation-dependent life cycle of HPVs, including virion morphogenesis (Mclaughlin-Drubin et al., 2003; Mclaughlin-Drubin and Meyers, 2005) . Fang et al. (2006) demonstrated episomal maintenance of HPV-11 DNA in N-Tert cells. HPV-11 episomal DNA-contain- Barrila et al., 2010 Hjelm et al., 2010 Unsworth et al., 1998 Hammond and Hammond, 2001 Organotypic epithelial raft cultures ing cell populations grown in raft culture showed induction of a productive viral life cycle. This system has served as a faithful in vitro model for investigating propagation, infection and neutralization of HPVs, as well as producing infectious HPV virions (Ozbun, 2002; Mclaughlin-Drubin et al., 2004; Chow et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009 ). Examinations of virus-host interactions have also been reported (Anacker and Moody, 2012) . Several researchers have further used the organotypic epithelial raft cultures to study the interaction of HPV with other epitheliotropic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and HPVs, adeno-associated virus and HPV interaction Hermonat et al., 2005) . Importantly, Meyers et al. (2002) demonstrated that the nonstructural genes of HPV18 functionally interact with the structural genes of HPV16, allowing the complete HPV life cycle to occur, which is the first report of the propagation of chimeric HPV by normal life cycle pathways. Screening and evaluating antiviral compounds can also be carried out with raft cultures (Satsuka et al., 2010) . Recently, research on the relationship between tumor progression and HPV is increasing, which will hopefully lead to the development of effective treatments for HPV-associated cancer. A detailed review concerning evaluation of the efficacy of the therapeutic interventions for HPV using epithelial raft cultures has been published by Andrei et al. (2010) . So far, these studies appear to be rather limited. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have addressed more specifically the role of HPV gene products and the difference in protein function between different HPV types, as well as the mechanisms of HPV carcinogenesis, especially the relationship between HPV oncoproteins (E2, E4, E5) and cervical tumors (Doorbar, 2016) . The effects of HPV16 E5 deletion mutants on epithelial morphology have been reported by Barbaresi et al. (2010) . Mole et al. (2009) using the organotypic raft culture with epithelial cells, demonstrated that SF2/ASF (splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor) is up-regulated in response to differentiation in HPV-infected cervical epithelial raft tissue. A specific subset of SR proteins (Ser-Arg rich proteins) regulated by HPV16 E2, including SF2/ASF, SRp20 and SC35, were also overexpressed during cervical tumor progression. Furthermore, organotypic raft cultures using verruciformis-derived keratinocytes could be used to reconstruct the \u03b2-HPV life cycle and show the relationship between \u03b2-HPV E4 expression patterns and disease severity. This finding is indicative that E4 may be a possible marker of viral expression during \u03b2-HPV-associated skin cancer progression (Borgogna et al., 2012) . A longitudinal cell culture using organotypic raft cultures has been used to investigate the immortalizing and transforming abilities of naturally occurring E6 variants in primary human foreskin keratinocytes (PHFKs). The observations provided insight into the mechanisms behind how PHFKs are immortalized and transformed into malignant tumors by the viral oncoproteins of HPV16 (Richard et al., 2010) . In addition, a breakthrough in HPV chimeric genomes producing infectious virus in organotypic raft cultures was achieved. Researchers constructed HPV18 chimeric genomes in which the HPV18 capsid genes were replaced with those of evolutionarily diverse PV types, including HPV45, HPV39, HPV33, HPV31, HPV11, HPV6b, HPV1a, CRPV and BPV1. Each of the chimeric genomes generated infectious viral particles in organotypic raft cultures (Bowser et al., 2011) .",

Although dramatic progress has been made in the development of novel antiviral drugs (De Clercq, 2007) , an effective vaccine remains elusive despite two decades of effort (Maartens et al., 2014) . The use of antiretroviral drugs has markedly reduced the mortality rate amongst AIDS patients. However, the effect of these drugs on oral epithelium growth and differentiation is presently unknown. A new 3D cell culture system, organotypic raft cultures of gingival keratinocytes, has been established. Research demonstrated that HIV protease inhibitor amprenavir severely inhibited the growth of gingival epithelium cultured in this model. When the drug was added at day 8, amprenavir treatments altered the proliferation and differentiation of gingival keratinocytes (Israr et al., 2010) . There are several other studies that have reported similar results utilizing organotypic raft cultures of gingival keratinocytes to investigate the effect of anti-HIV drugs on gingival epithelium growth and differentiation. Those drugs included protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, efavirenz and tenofovir (Israr et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014) . Furthermore, Balzarini et al. (2013) developed a multi-targeted drug, 6-phosphonylmethoxyethoxy-2, 4-diaminopyrimidine (PMEO-DAPym), and demonstrated that this drug efficiently suppressed both HIV-1 and HSV-2 in organotypic epithelial raft cultures of primary human keratinocytes. In addition, 3D cell cultures could be developed as a potential model for studying the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection and the development of drug candidates that could effectively treat the neurological complications of HIV infection . Investigating the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and designing multi-targeted antiviral drugs that could effectively suppress both HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) (or HCV) may lead to the future direction of HIV in 3D culture systems.",

Researchers succeeded in reconstituting a hepatic-like structure formation from Huh-7 cells using a calcium-alginate encapsulation model, which provides an opportunity for viral studies, especially for application with HCV (Tran et al., 2013) . Recently, Mebiolgel-derived 3D culture models were shown to support cell growth as 3D spheroids for up to 63 days, this system was susceptible to HCV infection and replication; it could be implemented as an alternate for primary hepatocytes in studies such as viral isolation from patient serum (Rajalakshmy et al., 2015) .",

HSV-1 is normally associated with orofacial infections and encephalitis, whereas HSV-2 usually causes genital infections. More culture models have been applied to epithelial cells for researching HSV. The organotypic raft culture system, which accurately mimics the in vivo physiology of the epidermis, is a most powerful tool for studying infectious agents that infect the epithelium. The first report about the application of 3D organotypic raft culture for the study of HSV appeared in 1996 (Syrjanen et al., 1996) . Researchers demonstrated that the F strain of HSV-1 had the ability to produce lytic or nonproductive infection in HaCaT cells (immortalized skin keratinocytes) cultured in a 3D organotypic tissue culture. The cultures were infected with HSV-1 (5 PFU) 30 min after the lifting of the epithelial cells into the air-liquid interface and were collected 1 week after inoculation. These cultures were positive for HSV DNA using PCR. One year later, another research study focused on utilizing the organotypic tissue culture methodology for the study of the infection, replication and spread of HSV-1 in fully stratified and differentiated human epithelial tissue (Visalli et al., 1997) . A similar HSV-1 culture system has also been described by Hukkanen et al. (1999) . They reported HSV-1 could infect immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes cultured in an organotypic raft culture system, the virus yield was highest when the inoculation took place 72h after seeding. In addition, 3D epithelial raft culture represents a novel model for the study of antiviral agents active against HSV. Researchers have shown that specific compounds, such as foscarnet and cidofovir, can reduce the replication and spread of HSV in raft cultures of human keratinocytes (Andrei et al., 2005) .",

Unfortunately, investigating VZV pathogenesis is challenging as VZV is strictly a human pathogen and infection is highly restricted in other species. In addition, few culture models are available for studying the interaction between VZV and human neurons, because the life span of terminally differentiated human neurons in culture is short (Goodwin et al., 2013; Zerboni et al., 2014) .",

Researchers have reported that they studied the action of antiviral compounds against VZV in organotypic epithelial raft cultures. The cultures were infected by VZV after 4 to 5 days of human keratinocyte differentiation and treated with serial dilutions of antiviral compounds. The antiviral effects were quantified by determining the viral DNA load by real-time PCR for VZV. Furthermore, this system could be very useful for the study of the interactions between viruses and the skin. The raft cultures have been used as a novel approach for investigating VZV replication in epidermal cells undergoing differentiation (Andrei et al., 2005) .

VZV produced a persistent infection in NHNP cell TLAs, which could be maintained for at least 3 months. This 3D culture system is likely to contribute to deciphering the establishment of VZV latency and reactivation in future studies (Goodwin et al., 2015) . Despite advances having been made in understanding VZV-host interactions, numerous questions relating to VZV pathogenesis remain unresolved (Zerboni et al., 2014) . 3D culture systems have the potential to provide new approaches for preventing and treating VZV infections, in particular they may provide the cell system required for the generation of high-titer, cell-free attenuated virus for vaccine production.",

More recently, research has demonstrated that adenoviruses could effectively deliver transgenes into the cultured 3D \"mini-gut\" organoids using adenoviral vectors that expressed fluorescent proteins. The transgene expression could be maintained for at least 10 days. These results were indicative that adenovirus vectors should be explored as effective gene delivery vehicles to introduce genetic manipulations in 3D organoids (Wang et al., 2014) .",

Straub et al.

The results showed that this model could support the natural growth of human NoVs. However, other investigators reported that using these same methods had not been suc-cessful. In 2011, Straub et al.

For example, 3D porcine epithelial cell cultures were designed to help understand the interaction between foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and porcine mucosal epithelial cells. The results demonstrated that FMDV replicated only transiently without any visible cytopathic effect, and infectious progeny virus could be recovered only from the apical side (Dash et al., 2010) . Researchers reported that a panel of clinical human rhinovirus (HRV) species C specimens, including HRV-C2, HRV-C7, HRV-C12, HRV-C15 and HRV-C29 types, were all capable of mediating productive infection in reconstituted 3D human primary upper airway epithelial tissues, and that the virions entered and exited preferentially through the apical surface. This model is considered as a potential tool for modeling the respirat- ory epithelium in the study of infections caused not only by HRVs, but also by other respiratory pathogens (Tapparel et al., 2013) . In addition, 3D human intestinal enteroid cultures were designed as a novel pathophysiological model for studying human rotavirus infection, host restriction and pathophysiology (Saxena et al., 2015) . Furthermore, Lam et al. (2012) demonstrated a method for measuring the impact of infection on the mechanics of a 3D model of connective tissue using human cytomegalovirus.

Recent progress in the imaging of 3D dynamics may promote the development of 3D cell culture. 3D culture models provide a potential tool for studying viral growth, infection, pathogenesis, and virus-host interaction. These culture systems have allowed a breakthrough in the cultivation of fastidious viral pathogens, which has advanced our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie pathogenic processes in both the virus and host (Barrila et al., 2010) . In addition, these models will play a key role in preclinical drug and therapeutic discovery. It is estimated that 10%-15% of human cancers worldwide are caused by seven human viruses (Moore and Chang, 2010) . As an example, high-risk HPV causes cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus leads to Kaposi's sarcoma and HBV contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the understanding of the relationship between human viruses and tumors is still limited, especially the therapy strategies. 3D cell culture models, capturing tumor complexity in vitro, provide a potentially powerful physical tool for investigating virus-cancer interaction and evaluating antiviral agents. In addition, analyzing the mechanism of human tumor virology in 3D in vitro may be useful for predicting cancer progress. So far, although the development and testing of viral vaccine in 3D culture systems is limited, these models may be useful as an alternative means for evaluating preclinical vaccines in the future. Moreover, 3D co-culture holds enormous potential for studying virus-virus interactions (such as HSV and HPV), and for developing novel products for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral disease. In recent years, the development of multi-targeted drugs for suppressing two or more viruses has been receiving widespread attention. It might also be possible to use 3D models for the specific design of effective individual therapy according to patient-specific strains. Most importantly, 3D culture systems may be used not only in future virological studies, but also in more tissue engineering. We expect that these novel, easily made and reliable models will make a contribution to the further understanding of biological science.",
