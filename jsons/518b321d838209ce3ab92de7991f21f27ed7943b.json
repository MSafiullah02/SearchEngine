            "text": "Since 1986, an explosive epizootic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has occurred in the UK: about 166,000 cattle were affected up to 1997, with peak incidence between 1992 and 1993. According to the main symptom -loss of neuromuscular coordination -the syndrome has informally been called \"mad cow disease\". It originated from the use of ovine meat-bone meal added to the fodder of cattle; some of the source sheep cadavers had been infected with scrapie, another spongiform encephalopathy, known and described in Great Britain since 1732. Scrapie was widely dispersed in Britain by the mass use of a vaccine against louping ill (1938 and later) unintentionally contaminated with scrapie. In cattle a disease similar to scrapie was never observed before 1986; in the 1980s, scrapie obviously overcame the species barrier and adapted to cattle (a \"host-jumping event\"). The infectious agent in BSE and in similar \"slow\" or \"unconventional\" diseases, called generally transmissive spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), with an incubation period usually over 3 years in diverse mammals (mink, cat, deer) including man (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, or kuru) are so-called prions (Stanley B. Prusiner 1982: \"proteinaceous infectious particles\", a modified acronym), causing vacuolisation of the brain tissue that looks like a sea sponge or an Emmental cheese. It is interesting that the prion PrP c is a physiological normal protein in the CNS, which however can change its conformation (spatial configuration) from the molecule with a prevailing \u03b1-helix structure to the pathogenic \u03b2-folded flat structure PrP Sc (the index Sc means scrapie). Following this structural rearrangement, the molecule becomes hydrophobic and resistant to disintegration. An accumulation of these PrP Sc prions in the CNS leads to the subsequent destruction of neurons. The pathological isoform of the prion posseses several other quite unusual characteristics: it is non-antigenic (no humoral antibodies are produced against the prion), resistant against proteases (this is why it accumulates in tissue not being metabolised), high temperature (it does not inactivate at 121 \u2022 C for 60 min nor at 240 \u2022 C for 1 min) and common disinfection liquids (peracetic acid, phenol, alcohols, formalin, ultraviolet and microvave irradiation), while undiluted sodium hypochlorite, 4% NaOH, or autoclaving at 134 \u2022 C for 60 min are effective.",

            "text": "Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) was described in 1920-1921. It is a rare, but absolutely fatal disease with a mean incidence of about 0.4 cases per 10 million population, usually hereditary but there is also a transmissible form e.g. during corneal transplantation or on application of hypophyseal growth hormone. A new variant of human CJD (abbreviated as \"vCJD\") has been observed in Britain since 1994, differing from classic CJD by a substantially shorter incubation period (months rather than years), a much higher incidence rate (the original inter-annual increase of the incidence was 20-30%) and in also affecting young people. This vCJD was detected disproportionately more often in families of farmers in areas where BSE was endemic and after contact with diseased cattle. There is a justified hypothesis that vCJD is, in fact, BSE transmitted to humans, it means a zoonosis. This hypothesis has been promoted by results of several experiments with BSE on animals (monkeys and mice). The CNS, bone marrow, neural ganglions, ileum, retina, and so-called mechanically-recovered meat (remnants of meat detached from backbone and ribs, used for preparation of hamburgers, sausages and minced meat in tins for humans and pet animals) are regarded as risky bovine tissues for consumption. Until August 2010, \"only\" 212 people had died of vCJD (against the originally expected many hundreds or thousands of victims), out of which 43 patients were from outside Great Britain (France 25 cases, Ireland 6, the Netherlands 2, Spain 1, Portugal 1, Italy 2, Canada 1, USA 3, Japan 1, and Saudi Arabia 1). The epidemic was efficiently controlled by drastic veterinary measures: culling, and the ban on feeding meat-bone meal to cattle.",

Numerically most common viral agents of zoonoses are arboviruses. The acronym arbovirus (for \"arthropod-borne virus\", coined by W. M. Hammon in 1958) was suggested by W. C. Reeves, and recommended for general use by the WHO in 1960. Arboviruses do not constitute a taxonomic unit, but an ecological group with a common mode of transmission to vertebrates. Their existence in nature is conditioned by replication in blood-feeding (haematophagous) arthropods and by an interaction between these arthropods and vertebrates. It is important that transmission from the vector arthropod to the recipient vertebrate is biological, not mechanical. The ability of replication in two phylogenetically and physiologically diverse organisms -poikilothermic arthropods and homeothermic vertebrates -and, at the same time, at largely varying ambient temperatures, is a remarkable characteristic and one that is in other viruses unusual.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of arbovirus and other virus infections is largely based on serological laboratory analysis, optimally by using paired blood serum samples taken at an interval of 2-3 weeks. Recent infection is said to be demonstrated when the patient seroconverts between the two intervals (i.e., the 1st sample is without antibodies, while the 2nd sample contains antibodies to a particular virus) or when there is an at least fourfold increase of antibody titre against the virus, as revealed in different serological tests, e.g. ELISA, HIT, CFT, VNT, IFA etc. (Lennette, Schmidt et al. 1974 ). If there is only one (convalescent) serum sample of the patient available, the differentiation of recent infection from a past one can be done by testing for IgM and IgG immunoglobulins -in recent infections IgM antibodies prevail over IgG. A very significant, but difficult and time-consuming technique is the isolation of the virus agent from the blood, CSF or bioptic samples of the patient using inoculation of suckling mice, cell cultures or chicken embryos. In the last decade, isolation techniques have started to be intensively replaced by molecular techniques detecting specific nucleic acids of particular viral agents: traditional or real-time PCR and RT-PCR, nested (RT-)PCR, RLB, sequencing, and others. These methods are excellent tools, although they also have some specific limitations (e.g., they do not show whether the nucleic acid fragments originate from a viable virus). Various immunohistochemistry techniques are also very convenient for the detection of viruses in the vertebrate tissues, and usually they are highly specific.",

Animal disease: inapparent course (however, some species of New World monkeys die after experimental inoculation). Transmission mode ( In the sylvatic cycle, man acquires infection accidentally during occupational (e.g., hunters) or recreational (tourism) activities. In Africa, an intermediate (savannah) cycle involves transmission of YF from tree holebreeding Aedes spp. (e.g., Ae. opok, Ae. luteocephalus) to humans living or working in jungle border areas. For typical habitats of sylvatic YF, see Photos 5.1 and 5.2. Human disease: yellow fever -high fever with chills, headache, backache, vomiting (in severe cases black vomit containing blood), haemorrhages, necrotic hepatitis (YF virus reveals a marked hepatotropism) with icterus, nephritis, albuminuria, sometimes also encephalitis; fatality rate is 5-40%. YF was introduced in the Caribbean from western Africa during the slave trade (introduction of viraemic persons and infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes on slave ships): the first extensive epidemic occurred here in 1647-1648 and involved Little Antilles (Barbados, St. Cristof, Guadeloupe), Yucatan and Cuba (in Havana one-third of citizens died); epidemics occurred frequently in Central America also in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1741 and 1802-1803, big outbreaks of YF were reported in Portugal and Spain (80,000 victims -also an import on ships, with a consequent spread from seaports to inland); in 1793, 15% citizens of Philadelphia died on YF; in 1853, 8,000 persons from 29,000 infected died in New Orleans; 1900, Havana: Human disease: Japanese encephalitis with fever, headaches, myalgia, decreased consciousness, convulsions, pareses, aggravated breathing; fatality rate 20-40%; common are severe irreversible sequelae in 30-40% of patients (and even higher proportion among children). The first recorded extensive JE epidemic occurred in 1924, with 6,125 cases including 3,197 deaths. The present incidence in Asia is thousands of patients yearly: in the 1990s it was on average 45,000 (about 10,000 fatal), while in the last years 20-50 thousands annually, out of them 6,000-10,000 fatal (for instance, China reported a total of 38, 000 cases in 1990, about 15,000 in 1995, 8,100 in 1999, and 5,104 1950-1951, 1956, 1971, and 1974 .

During a mixed simultaneous infection of cells in a vector or vertebrate host with different but related bunyviruses, reassortant (hybrid) virions can arise through incorporation of RNA segments from different viruses. Incidence of this disease is low. The disease with Ilesha (7 cases) and Bwamba (9 cases) viruses included fever with headache, myalgia and rashof the observed Ilesha cases, one was fatal. One encephalitic case caused by Tensaw virus was reported. Also these American species of rodents are not only the competent hosts of hantaviruses, but at the same time also the reservoir, due to their persistent infection combined with long-term excretion of the virus by saliva, urine and faeces. Animal disease: inapparent course. Transmission mode: aerogenic (dried particles of rodents' infectious excreta -urine, faeces, saliva), contact (rodent bite), and alimentary -food contaminated by infected rodents. Epidemiological cycle is analogical to that of the Old World hantaviruses. The main risk factor for acquiring HPS or HCPS is being a \"male farmer seeing or killing rats in the fields or dwellings\". Human disease: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) -high fever, chills, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhoea, nausea, sweat, thrombocytopenia, severe hypotension, cough, pneumonia (marked oedema of the lungs)intensive care including assisted ventilation is necessary, carditis (when also carditis is associated with the syndrome, the disease is called hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome, HCPS); high fatality rate, 45-70%. Sin Nombre: 186 cases in USA, 1993 USA, -1998 .

Transmission mode: percutaneous -biting of an infected mammal (virus in saliva), transplantation of cornea (8 cases), liver and kidneys (2 cases in Germany, infection of the donor originated in India). Human disease: rabies (lyssa) -encephalomyelitis with excitation, aerophobia (patient cannot stand breath of air over face), hydrophobia, anxiety, hallucinations and bizzare aggressive behaviour, eventually followed by paralysis, coma and terminating with death at full consciousness (without treatment, the fatality rate is 100%). Acute neurologic disease is divided into furious and paralytic (dumb) forms. Incubation period is long, 10 days to 6 months. The disease was known already in the Old Babylon, Egypt, Israel, India, China, ancient Greece and Rome. According to WHO, about 50,000-60,000 human deaths from rabies are estimated to occur annually, most often in Asia: e.g., about 20,000 cases in India (the Buddhist and Hindu ethics forbid culling the stray dogs; also in Thailand the killing of stray dogs is prohibited). Bio-containment: BSL-2/3. Diagnosis: anamnesis (animal bite); observation of the captured biting animal for the period of 5-10 days by a veterinarian, or post-mortem examination of the animal (histological slides of the brain and salivary glands -detection of antigen by the technique IF, Negri bodies or intracerebral inoculation of mouse); in the human patient, IF microscopy of corneal, mucosal and bioptic samples; also isolation on mice. Treatment: post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an immunization with several doses of vaccine combined with antiserum application (antirabic equine immunoglobuline). Prevention: vaccination of exposed persons -several effective inactivated rabies vaccines are currently available worldwide (the virus is cultivated in human diploid cells); obligatory immunization of pet dogs, reduction of foxes or their vaccination (baited oral vaccine with strain SAD, suggested by George M. Baer); the latter method has 80% effectivity in the fox populations. Oral vaccination of foxes started in Europe in Switzerland (1978) , and it has then been used in France, Germany, Czechland and other countries. Geographical distribution: Lyssavirus s.s. occurs worldwide with the exception of Great Britain (the UK has applied a very strict policy since 1886: a 6-month quarantine for import or visit of dogs and cats), Ireland, Iceland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and some other islands.

Free-living waterfowl, gulls and shorebirds are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses in nature. Some wild anseriforms (swans, geese, ducks) also participate in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Animal disease: inapparent (in a majority of waterbirds) or fever, sinusitis, bronchopneumonia, oedema of the face and neck, cyanosis -e.g., \"fowl plague\" in hens due to HPAI virus subtypes H5 and H7, with a fatality rate 70-100%; these subtypes may cause clinical disease also in some terrestrial and aquatic mammals. Transmission mode: aerogenic (a droplet infection), also by conjunctivae and contact. In the zoonotic HPAI H5N1 virus is the highest risk of human infection associated with processing of fowl (killing, removal of feather, cutting into portions), and in Asian animal markets with living fowl if it is infected. Human-to-human transmission of HPAI viruses has been absent or very rare. Close contacts of humans with domestic ducks, chickens and pigs (common dwellings) in southeastern Asia present a permanent epidemiological risk into the future. Bio-containment: BSL-2 (but HPAI H5N1: BSL-2/3). Diagnosis: isolation and cultivation in chick embryos or on cell cultures, detection of antigen or RNA in the samples, serology (HIT). Treatment: antivirotics amantadin, rimantadin, zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu) might moderate the clinical course, but resistant strains of influenza A have already appeared. Prevention: vaccine (human and fowl), culling of infected animal breeds. Geographical distribution: worldwide; most strains of zoonotic influenza originate in Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "Members of the order Chlamydiales are very small Gram-negative spherical bacteria with a diameter of 0.3-0.5 \u03bcm, obligate intracellular parasites preferentially of the mucosal epithelium. They do have solid cell wall but without muramic acid (in contrast to other bacteria peptidoglycan between the wall and plasmatic membrane is absent). They do not posses their own energetic metabolism and depend on the ATP system of the host cell (they are therefore called \"energetic parasites\"); thanks to this adaption, their genome is markedly reduced. The peculiar life cycle of chlamydiae differs greatly from that of other bacteria, and involves small extracellular non-metabolising but infectious elementary bodies (0.3-0.5 \u03bcm) that produce in the infected cell bigger and non-infectious reticulate bodies (also called \"initial bodies\", 0.7-1.1 \u03bcm); those divide by binary fission and form new elementary bodies which are able to survive extracellularly and also infect new hosts. Cell inclusions visible microscopically in chlamydial infections are, in fact, conglomerates (colonies) of replicating reticulate bodies together with the daughter elementary bodies. Finally, the infected cells crack or the bodies escape by exocytosis. Chlamydiae are well stained for microscopy according to Macchiavelli (initial bodies are stained blue, and reticulate bodies red) or Giemsa (blue and purple, respectively). The tenacity of chlamydiae in the milieu is very limited, especially for reticulate bodies (however, avian strains of Chlamydophila psittaci can survive in bird droppings for a long time). Chlamydiae are sensitive to diethyl ether because 50% of the cell wall content is formed by lipids, and are readily inactivated by certain antibiotics, largely those that inhibit proteosynthesis (chloramphenicol or tetracycline). The only typical zoonotic species among chlamydiae is Chlamydophila psittaci, while two other species cause anthroponotic infections: Chlamydophila pneumoniae causes respiratory infections (possibly also atherosclerosis and coronary disease), and Chlamydia trachomatis trachoma, but its serotypes D to K very frequent sexually transmissible infections of the human urogenital tract (and proctitis), and serotype L is the agent of lymphogranuloma venereum. In contrast to rickettsiae, chlamydiae are not transmitted by arthropod vectors.",

Another species of the genus Francisella is F. philomiragia, living saprophytically in water, being of low pathogenicity for man. There are also ichthyopathogenic francisellae recorded in marine fish farms in USA, Japan and Norway which are not pathogenic for endothermic vertebrates and are unable to grow at 37 \u2022 C. Very interesting are the francisellae living as endosymbionts in metastriate ixodid ticks especially of the genus Dermacentor in the Holarctis. The new findings indicate two probable trajectories of evolutionary adaptation from saprophytism to parasitism within the genus Francisella: (a) via water organisms; (b) via ixodid ticks.",

Occupational disease: farmers, hunters or trappers of leporids and big rodents (caught for skin, e.g. muskrats), workers in veterinary laboratories. There was a big outbreak of hare/rodent-borne tularaemia in Central Europe (Austria, Czechoslovakia) in 1936/1937, with many hundreds of patients. A recent (1999) (2000) outbreak of largely alimentary tularaemia in Kosovo involved 327 confirmed cases; the main source were rodents, overpopulated during the Civil War in this region. The first two outbreaks of tularaemia in Spain occurred in 1997 and 1998, and were associated with hare hunting (585 patients) and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) fishing in a contaminated freshwater stream, respectively. In the USA from 1990 to 2000, the average annual number of human cases of tularaemia was 124 (the range, 86-193); however, prior to 1950 there were many hundreds of cases annually (maximum in 1939: 2,291 reported patients). For comparison, in the Central-European Czechland (about 10 million population), the annual incidence averaged in the same decade 75 cases (the range, 12-225); an absolute maximum of tularaemia incidence in Czechland was recorded in 1962, with a total of 1,468 reported (serologically confirmed) patients.

Diagnosis: serology (micro-AR, IFA, CFT; antigen phase II indicates acute infection, while antigen I confirms the chronic stage of Q fever; in ELISA there can occur cross-reactions with Chlamydophila psittaci), intraperitoneal inoculation of the blood sample in guinea pig, mouse or on chick embryo (patients have intense bacteraemia during acute phase of the illness, but the isolation is a risky operation); staining after Gim\u00e9nez or Giemsa, immunohistochemistry; PCR. Treatment: doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol (they shorten febrile period, but do not kill the intracellularly localized coxiellae), cotrimoxazole in children and pregnant women; a recommended combinations in chronic cases of Q fever are doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine, rifampicin or cotrimoxazole. Prevention: Australian vaccine is approved for humans (it is prepared from the phase I); the protection is assumed to last 10 years. Culling of infected small ruminant herds according to the \"test (bulk milk samples tested by PCR) and slaughter\" policy. In addition, mandatory vaccination of small ruminants started in the Netherlands in 2009.

Salmonellae are able to persist for a long time in visceral organs of mammals (spleen, liver, kidney, biliary duct) and in oviducts of fowl. S. Dublin and S. Pullorum (both not transmissible to man) cause severe disease in cattle and in chickens, respectively. Transmission mode: alimentary -typical \"food-borne disease\" (mainly via contaminated eggs with S. Enteritidis and meat; MID for man is quite high, usually 106, exceptionally 102-103, but in some highly virulent strains allegedly 101 cells will do; some salmonellae easily replicate in foods at room temperature); direct contact (nosocomial infections). Great tenacity of S. Enteritidis (and other zoonotic salmonellae): e.g., in chicken droppings it survives viable \u22651 year. Human disease: salmonellosis, one of the most frequent and important zoonoses -gastroenteritis with a very short incubation period (6-48 h), watery diarrhoea (about 10 days), headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, usually associated with haematogenic and lymphogenic dissemination of the agent, sometimes resulting in meningitis (especially in children); fatality rate is low, about 0.1% (mortality only occurs in toddlers and old patients -via critical dehydratation). The most frequent serovars are S. Enteritidis (frequent phagotypes are European PT4 and American PT8; -they have been panzootic and pandemic in the 1990s) and S. Typhimurium, less common are e.g. S. Virchow, S. Agona, and a number of others. Incidence of salmonellosis in the USA: 1956 reported 1,700 cases, while 1965 already 20,865. A similar increase of incidence was recorded in European countries; for instance in Czechland: 1,981 reported cases in 1955, 4,975 in 1965, 7,678 in 1975, 8,492 in 1985, and 52,588 in 1995. A considerable increase of the incidence in Czechland was reported in 1989, from 11 to 24 thousands of cases (it was caused by import of pandemic strain of the serovar S. Enteritidis from west Europe and USA), and the subsequent mean salmonella morbidity in the years 1990-2000 was 43,450 cases annually. While the incidence rate of salmonellosis per 100,000 population in Czechland was 385 in 1997, the average for Europe in the same year was 20-130, but it could be biased by underreporting (or no obligatory reporting) of the disease in some European countries. An instructive outbreak of salmonellosis occurred in Minnesota in 1994 with 224,000 patients (the largest salmonellosis outbreak in the U.S.A.): infective vehiculum was ice cream, and the mechanism was contamination with S. Enteritidis of a tank transporting egg melange used for preparation of that ice cream. The economical costs of salmonellosis can be high: it has been calculated that diagnosis and therapy of one human case of this disease in EU countries will cost on average 1,100C.

The plague sometimes occurs as an occupational infectious disease -hunters of marmots and other rodents: e.g. 19 marmot hunters (handling infected animals or their carcasses) got plague in north China in 2004, and 8 died. An alternative (but speculative) mode for Y. pestis transmission during outbreaks might be via the body lice Pediculus humanus. Types of disease foci: (1) primary, natural, sylvatic (the hosts of the agent are exoanthropic rodents) in steppe, semidesert or tropical forest ecosystems;",

The clinical forms are bubonic (bubonic plague, with lymphadenitis: swollen and extremely painful lymph nodes called buboes), pulmonary (severe bronchopneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome -usually in the anthroponotic infection), oroglandular (after an alimentary infection, associated with abdominal pain and diarrhoea), and primarily septic (without lymphadenitis, but with meningitis, endotoxic shock, organ failure and a disseminated intravascular coagulation); occasional severe peripheral tissue necrosis and gangrene remind of medieval epithet (\"Black Death\"). Mean fatality rate is 2-10% in treated and 50-95% in untreated cases (the most lethal are septic and pulmonary forms). Historically, the first major epidemic of plague was reported in China in 224 BC. Later on, three pandemics of plague were recorded: (1) \"Justinian's plague\" in the sixth century (with roughly 100 million victims out of the 142 million infected); (2) \"black death\" in the fourteenth century killed nearly whole populations of Tatars and Saracens, then the disease encompassed nearly whole Europe where died one-fourth of the population (about 25 millions), and further roughly 25 millions died before in Asia and Africa; (3) \"modern\" plague in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (30 million people got the disease, 12 millions of them died; the pandemic started in Hongkong after introduction from the continental China; rats and their fleas dispersed plague on ships to many seaports of Japan, India, Europe, Africa, America and Australia (2010) involved 31 cases including 3 deaths (the last outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Peru before was in 1994, which affected more than 1,100 persons and killed 35 of them).

In Great Britain the annual incidence of campylobacterosis attained 50,000 cases in the years 1997-1999 and surpassed that of salmonellosis (51,800 cases in 2007). A similar trend was observed in Czechland (EPIDAT Report on incidence of infectious diseases): while the mean annual incidence was 8,630 cases in the decade 1990-2000, as many as 23,480 cases (annual average; the range, 20-30 thousands) were reported in the period 2001-2008, i.e. not much less than in salmonellosis in the same period (annual average 25,800, the range 11,000-33,000 cases).

Human disease: leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses in the world -a flu-like illness, often with biphasic body temperature curve, aseptic meningitis and nephritis (albuminuria). The course of the disease varies according to serovar; the most severe is Weil's disease (L. interrogans Icterohaemorrhagiae) with hepatitis, icterus, myalgia, necroses, cardiac and ocular involvement, nephritis (damage to glomerulae; leptospiruria), haemorrhagies, encephalitis, and fatality rate in untreated cases 10-20%; milder but most frequent is the \"harvest fever\" in central Europe (caused by L. interrogans Grippotyphosa); also other anicteric leptospiroses usually have milder symptoms, e.g. \"fever of swine breeders\" (L. interrogans Pomona). The incidence of leptospirosis is not very high in most countries; for instance in Czechland, on the average 82 (the range, 12-226) cases were reported annually in the years 1970-1999, while 38 (the range, 11-88) in the decade 1990-2000 (0.4 cases per 100,000 population); in France, an average of about 250 cases annually have been reported since 1980 (0.5 cases/100,000). Occupational disease: up to 30% of cases form butchers in slaughterhouses, farmers, meat inspectors, workers in sewerage system, miners, soldiers, gamekeepers, hunters, rodent control workers, sugar cane cutters, ricefield workers, animal attendants in zoological gardens and workers in sewerage system; leptospirosis also often occurs as a \"recreational\" (leisure time) infectious disease (about 30% of all cases) -during outdoor activities like water sports (canoeing, swimming), or camping. Epidemics also follow natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes or earthquakes. For instance, 167 Philippinos died from leptospirosis after storm Ondoy flooded Manila and Rizal in 2009.

B. burgdorferi can sometimes persist in the human body for long periods (up to 10 years), e.g. in synovial fluid or in the CNS (often in changed morphological forms -cystic, circular or granular). LB is the most frequent ixodid tick-borne human disease in the world, with an estimated 85,000 patients annually (Europe 65,000, North America 16,500, Asia 3,500). For instance in Czechland was reported on average 3,330 (the range, 1,446-6,302) cases annually in the years 1990-2006, which presents an incidence rate of 32 (the range, 16-61) per 100,000 population (EPIDAT). Bio-containment: BSL-2. Diagnosis: symptoms (EM) and anamnesis (tick bites), serology (ELISA IgM and IgG, optimally with confirmation using WB; IF); isolation of spirochaetes from the skin biopsy or from CSF fluid complex BSK (or MPK) medium at 33 \u2022 C (the growth is very slow); also electron or IF microscopy of CSF; PCR. The 'cystic forms' or 'blebs' are impossible to diagnose in darkfield microscopy. Treatment: doxycycline, amoxicilin, penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, deoxymykoin in the acute phase; in the chronic phase cephalosporins (cefotaxim, ceftriaxon), or big doses of penicillin. Prevention: suitable human vaccine against LB does not exist at present. The lately released US vaccine \"LYMErix\" was removed from the market several years ago. Examination by darkfield microscopy or PCR of ixodid ticks feeding on a person may be helpful -in positive cases, prophylactic treatment of the person with one or few doses of doxycycline should be recommended. Geographical distribution: holarctic (Europe; northern Asia -including Siberia, China, Japan, Korea; and North America). For different habitats of LB agents, see Photos 5.33 to 5.37.",

For instance, ten thousands of livestock died in Zimbabwe in 1979-1982; about abdominal; and septic. The number of anthrax cases in the world varies between 5 and 100,000 yearly (WHO), with a considerable mortality (25-100%) especially in non-cutaneous forms of the disease with septicaemia (the fatality rate in cutaneous forms is 5-20%). Epidemics: e.g., Zimbabwe c. 10,000 cases in 1979-1985 (the source: infected cattle); 64 persons died in Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) after an unintentional release of B. anthracis spores in 1979 from a plant producing bacteriological weapons; 2000 Volgograd: 25 persons were infected after consuming infected meat; 2000 Romanian Danube delta: 2 persons died. In 2001, anthrax spores were used as a bacteriological weapon in letters in USA: 22 persons were infected, and 5 of them died (11 cases were the inhalational clinical form, and 11 were the cutaneous form). Occupational disease: the wool, skin and fur proceeding workers (carpets etc.), veterinarians, butchers, farmers, diggers in burial ground with the anthrax contaminated bodies. Bio-containment: BSL-2/3. Potential bioterrorist agent (used, e.g., in USA). Diagnosis: symptoms (in cutaneous form), blood smear (Gram, IF) with detection of capsules (Giemsa or polychromic methylene blue stain, or phase contrast); cultivation (MPA, BA: colonies have a characteristic shape caput Medusae, without haemolysis; selective media such as PLET agar inhibiting Bacillus cereus); inoculation of laboratory mouse (or guinea pig, rabbit); Ascoli's precipitation reaction (overlaying of anti-anthrax precipitation serum with the filtered extract of the tested organ); serology (IFA), PCR. Treatment: large doses of penicillin, amoxicilin, ampicillin, penicillin combined with streptomycin; tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin. Prevention: vaccine (immunization with a toxoid; for humans and animals, a non-virulent strain; developed Louis Pasteur in 1880, who cultivated the strain for 6 weeks/42-43 \u2022 C); (a vaccine licensed in USA -AVA/Biothraxis applied by skin scarification). In leather manufacture, inactivation of B. anthracis spores with peracetic acid (Persteril) is used for raw materials (skins).

The macroscopic pattern of the fungal colony and microscopic morphology of the fungus is evaluated. In addition, biochemical identification sets are generally used for the determination of pathogenic yeasts (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans). Histological examinations are also applied in invasive visceral mycoses (e.g. histoplasmosis, blastomycosis) -the sections are usually stained according to Schiff's or the more specific Grocott and Gomori methods.

In addition to the domestic cycle (domestic cat -mouse) there is a sylvatic cycle, observed e.g. in French Guyana: highly virulent strains of T. gondii circulate between free-living jaguars (Panthera onca, the definitive host) and their prey (intermediate hostsdeer, armadillos, pacas, peccaries). Sources of human infection is undercooked meat from hunted game and water containing oocysts excreted by wild cats.

Chronic forms (sometimes latent period of 10-20 years): heart arhythmia, dilatation of heart, esophagus (\"megaoesoophagus\"), gut (\"megacolon\"), and hepatosplenomegaly; the death usually occurs after perforation (\"explosion\") of the dilated gut or heart.

Ninety percent of visceral leishmaniasis cases occur in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal and Sudan; 90% of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis occurs in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru; and 90% of cutaneous leishmaniasis occur in Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Brazil and Peru. The annual incidence in Europe (southern only) is much lower, about 750 cases. Asymptomatic infections of humans with Leishmania are 30\u2212100 times more frequent than the clinical cases. DNA of L. donovani was amplified from ancient Egyptian and Nubian mummies 4,000 years old. Bio-containment: BSL-2. Diagnosis: microscopy of amastigotes (biopsy -lymph nodes, scrapings, smears: amastigote forms 2.5-5\u00d72 \u03bcm, replicating in monocytes, macrophages; punctate from spleen or sternum in visceral leishmaniasis), cultivation (NNN agar), inoculation of mouse or Syrian hamster (ears, tail), serology (IFA, ELISA or haemagglutination test in visceral and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), intradermal test, PCR. Treatment: derivatives of pentavalent antimony (natrium stilbogluconate, megluminantimonate, pentamidine), pyrimethamine (Daraprim), amphotericin B (the most effective in liposomal form in visceral leishmaniasis: AmBiosome) or ketoconazole (in cutaneous leishmaniasis), cycloguanyl, miltefosine, N-chlorotaurin (L. donovani); local injections of ulcers, cryotherapy. Prevention and risk avoidance: human vaccine unavailable at present. LEISHMUNE vaccine is the first licensed vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani in Brazil. Skin collar with deltametrine can be helpful in dogs. Dog travel to and from endemic areas poses a risk of introducing L. infantum to other areas. Geographical distribution: (semi)arid areas -steppe and savannah in Asia (L. tropica, L. major, L. donovani), Africa (L. tropica, L. aethiopica, L. donovani) and the Mediterranean (L. tropica, L. infantum); forest ecosystems in Central and South America",

Except for the recent outbreak, all pandemic influenza A strains had in its genome inserted characteristic fragments of avian influenza viruses; they therefore emerged as reassortants of avian and mammalian influenza strains during co-infection of a susceptible mammal host (usually domestic pig as a 'mixing vessel'). However, sporadical zoonotic influenza infections of humans with equine, swine and avian strains have been reported, usually without a further spread in human population. For instance in Wisconsin (1990) several pig breeders became ill, and one pregnant women died. This so-called swine influenza caused about 50 laboratory-confirmed cases (7 patients died) worldwide up to 2008. Another zoonotic problem is avian influenza; first cases of it were described inHongkong (1997), where 18 persons were infected from chickens with the HPAI virus type H5N1 from chickens, and 6 of the patients died (one million hens had to be put down). In 2003, one veterinarian died after being infected with HPAI virus type H7N7 in the Netherlands (30 million chickens were then killed, and during this action 89 persons get fever with severe conjunctivitis).

Animal disease: pseudorabies (morbus Aujeszky) -encephalomyelitis with bronchopneumonia, fatal for piglets; in adult pigs the course is inapparent.Transmission mode: direct contact, percutaneous (biting). Human disease: nettle-rash, salivation, pharyngitis, affection of the CNS. However, the possibility of a zoonotic infection of man with this virus is unclear and doubted by many virologists. Bio-containment: BSL-2. Diagnosis: isolation in cell cultures, IF; VNT, ELISA. Geographical distribution: worldwide. Macacine Simplexvirus 1 (Herpesvirus B, Monkey B virus) Source of infection (natural host range): monkeys of the Old World (reservoir Macaca spp., mainly M. mulatta as well as M. fascicularis, but also M. fuscata, M. arctoides, M. cyclopsis and M. radiate): they excrete the virus with saliva and other secrets. Animal disease: inapparent course or stomatitis (small vesicles on tongue and mucosa), rarely encephalomyelitis. Transmission mode: contact -percutaneous (biting, scratching), also aerogenic; most commonly after a stress (caused e.g. by transport of the animals); there were reported also several laboratory infections during the work with monkey cell cultures. Human disease: simian herpes B (herpes simiae) -vesicles, lymphadenitis, severe encephalomyelitis with the fatality rate of 80%. Up to now a total of 40 cases have been reported. Risk groups: people getting into close contact with macaques (attendants, hunters, etc.). Bio-containment: BSL-3. Diagnosis: isolation on cell cultures, IF; VNT, ELISA. Treatment: acyclovir (Zovirax). Geographical distribution: southeastern Asia (also temples in Nepal and India), North Africa; secondarily other regions by transport of monkeys. Large subspherical or moderately pleomorphic virions (about 250\u00d7200 nm), enveloped, containing one linear molecule dsDNA sized 170-250 kbp.

Animal disease: pox. Transmission mode: contact with wild animals (especially in hunters); the man-to-man transmission is relatively rare, but after 1995 the proportion of secondary man-to-man infection has obviously increased. Human disease: monkeypox, similar to smallpox, with fever, hyperhidrosis, headaches, myalgia, backaches, extreme fatigue, rash, lymphadenitis (the latter symptom differentiates both diseases); fatality rate can attain 10% (reports show 4-33%) -most lethal is monkeypox for small children up to 4 years old. Monkeypox in humans was described in 1970, and to 1999 nearly 1,000 cases (40 fatal) were reported in Africa: e.g., 398 cases in DR Congo between 1981 and 1986, an outbreak in the same country in 1996/1997 (88 cases, fatality rate 4%), and a total of 51 laboratory-confirmed cases between 2001 and 2004. In 2003, monkeypox was imported with wild rodents of several genera (e.g. Cricetomys, Graphiurus) from Ghana to Wisconsin (USA) where several captive American prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) were infected and unintentionally distributed to other US states; 35 attending persons (12 veterinarians and several animal shop assistants) acquired the infection as well, and the number of humans infected with monkeypox increased then to 82 in USA. Bio-containment: BSL-3. Diagnosis (valid also for other poxvirus infections): symptomatology; histopathology and electron microscopy of the vesicular lesions, IF, and isolation (on chick embryos or cell cultures Vero, LLC-MK2) from skin lesions; serology (HIT, ELISA, RDPA). Treatment: cidofovir. Prevention: vaccine against smallpox protects against monkeypox. Geographical distribution: tropical forests in central and western Africa (DR Congo, Cameroon, Ghana, Gabon), Southeast Asia. By passaging this virus originated the vaccinia virus O. officinalis, [Lat. vacca = cow], used for vaccination against smallpox (variola, i.e. human pox).

It could lead in lethal disease without sufficient therapy. Immunocompromised persons seem to be the most susceptible (e.g., with HIV infection). Zoonotic tuberculosis constitutes in different regions 3-10% of overall tuberculosis cases in humans. Disease caused by M. microti occurs only rarely in human (a total of 11 cases have been described), usually in patients with HIV, but also two immunocompetent patients suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis due to M. microti in Germany in 1999.

Prevention: attenuated vaccine M. bovis BCG (bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin: effectiveness not optimal, about 80%); eradication programs in domestic animals. Attenuated vaccine from strain VO166 M. microti has been formerly used in Czech Republic and Great Britain. Vaccine strain (BCG) occasionally causes post-vaccination infections in immunosuppressed patients. Geographical distribution: worldwide (but eradicated in many countries). Treatment: difficult (number of strains are resistant) and long-term (at least 24 months), relapses of the diseases occur quite often. Therapy with isoniazid + rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol.

Transmission mode: aerogenic, alimentary; iatrogenic. Human disease: mycobacteriosis -chronic pulmonary disease (risk factor for acquiring infection: occupational exposure in coal miners; e.g., in Ostrava (Czechland), a total of 1,034 patients were recorded in 1968-1999), more often in immunocompromised persons (AIDS, chronic bronchitis, history of tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, or people with lung parenchyma damage). Extrapulmonary forms of the disease involve skin lesions, cervical lymphadenitis, and uterine infections. A case of fatal septicaemia was also demonstrated.
