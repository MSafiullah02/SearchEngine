Policy-makers have responded by increasing training and funding to these areas [18] [19] [20] . Similarly, planners within the public and private sectors have established tactics and procedures to respond to various emergency scenarios. These plans frequently consider methods to improve communications between various emergency responders and others who must have sufficient capability to contact each other in an emergency situation. Preparedness planning efforts targeting bioterrorism have occurred concurrently with initiatives to bolster public health infrastructure for other public health emergencies including natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) and naturally occurring disease outbreaks (e.g., pandemic influenza). Finally, preparedness planners have considered some of the ethical concerns raised by bioterrorism attacks and their potentially devastating consequences.",

Public health law grants public health agencies powers to detect, track, prevent, and contain health threats resulting from bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. However, many existing public health and emergency response laws at the state and federal levels may not be sufficient to address biological terrorism. These laws often do not grant public health authorities the necessary powers to stop an outbreak. Public health laws vary widely across different jurisdictions. As a result, the legal powers ascribed to public health officials may be different in scope and function in different locales.

The federal government will normally become involved in localized public health matters only at the request of the state or if the disease has the potential to cross state or international borders, or affect interstate interests.

Indeed, an outbreak may traverse international boundaries as well, which would clearly entail the input of the federal government. Bioterrorism implicates additional concerns beyond public health, including national security and law enforcement considerations. Federal public health and legal authorities may specifically respond to multiple components of a bioterrorism attack, as well as offer guidance and expertise to assist state and local governments in their responses. Thus, responses to bioterrorism require sufficient legal powers at both the federal and state levels, in addition to a wellconceived plan for coordinating these powers to maximize public benefit.",

Balancing these goals requires difficult choices that are further complicated when public health laws are unclear, poorly drafted, or confusing. To assist state and local law-and policy-makers, public health law scholars at the Center for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown University Law Center and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health drafted two model state public health acts. The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) was drafted quickly after September 11, 2001 , with input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and multiple national partner organizations [25, 26] . Completed on December 21, 2001, MSEHPA has served as a valuable template for states to modernize their public health laws to address public health emergencies, including emergencies caused by bioterrorism. It provides a modern framework for public health powers, authorizing state and local authorities to engage in a range of activities to address a public health emergency. These measures may restrict temporarily the liberty or property of affected individuals or groups to protect the public's health [27] . To date, 44 states and the District of Columbia have introduced bills based on some or all of the provisions of the MSEHPA, and 38 states and the District of Columbia have passed their respective bills [28] .",

            "text": "Quarantine and isolation are among the oldest of public health tools. Their use predates modern scientific advances in disease testing and treatment, not to mention modern conceptions of civil liberties. They operate on the most basic principle of infectious disease control-keeping healthy individuals separated from those who have been exposed or infected. In modern times, the mass use of quarantine or isolation has faded as rapid medical tests and effective treatments have become available. When quarantine and isolation have been used, they have been directed predominantly at specific infectious individuals, for example, to control recalcitrant tuberculosis patients [31] [32] [33] [34] . Nevertheless, for a disease of unknown etiology or a disease that poses a significant threat to a vulnerable population, quarantine and isolation may still be effective techniques to contain an outbreak. Depending on the scope of the outbreak, largescale quarantine measures may have to be considered. Modern logistics surrounding enactment of a large-scale quarantine would be complex and possibly unworkable [35] . The terms quarantine and isolation have engendered a great deal of confusion. The two terms are often used interchangeably, but in actuality represent distinct concepts. The term quarantine denotes a compulsory physical separation of an individual or a group of healthy people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to prevent transmission during the incubation period of the disease [21] . Historically, quarantine restrictions were often imposed on travelers to insure that they did not introduce a contagious disease into a country or town. The word itself derives from the Latin term quadragina and the Italian term quarante, which refer to the 40-day sequestration period enforced on merchant ships during plague outbreaks [21] . The term isolation, by contrast, means the separation, for the period of communicability, of known infected persons so as to prevent or limit the transmission of the infectious agent [21] . Precise usage of and differentiation between these terms is vital to insure that those subject to these powers receive appropriate treatment and protection.",

The federal quarantine statute, first enacted in 1796, authorized the president to assist states in their use of quarantines [36] . The federal government subsequently took control over maritime quarantines [37] . This expanded federal role prompted a debate over whether the federal or state government should administer quarantines-a debate which continues to this day. As discussed below, states claim that their quarantine authority derives from their police power, while the federal government argues that its authority arises from its constitutionally -granted power to regulate interstate commerce.",

These differences are evident in the structural distribution of power between the state and local governments and the substantive criteria (or lack thereof) for placing an individual under quarantine. Some states have a centralized public health system that retains most public health powers at the state level, including quarantine and isolation decisions. Other states delegate these decisions to local public health agencies. In these states, quarantine will generally be under the jurisdiction of local public health officials when the disease is confined to a discrete local area. If the outbreak affects more that one community within the state, the state public health authority will usually have the power to implement quarantine or isolation orders. Very few jurisdictions have articulated explicit procedures and policies to determine whether or not an individual should be subject to quarantine. Both the MSEHPA and Turning Point Act propose a systematic process for making this determination that considers the exigencies of the situation. Furthermore, they allow for an appeal of the decision if possible under the circumstances [25, 29] .",

This is problematic because the imposition of a large-scale quarantine will almost certainly involve the use of federal and state powers. Under these circumstances, there is the possibility of confusion and controversy over who is in charge. As past bioterrorism simulations and real emergencies like Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated, if the lines of authority are not clear to officials at all government levels, the public health response can be paralyzed and undermined [3, 4, 47, 48] .

The response to this question requires the decision-maker to balance the need for restrictive intervention with the effect it may have on the civil liberties of affected individuals. Modern commentary on the acceptability of quarantine asks whether the risk to the population posed by the disease justifies such a serious loss of liberty [21, 49, 50] . In addition to restrictions on liberty, imposing a quarantine temporarily deprives individuals of their economic livelihood, their right to travel or associate freely with others, and may subject them to stigma and discrimination. In a time of great crisis, public sentiment may strongly support such measures, but public sentiment alone is an insufficient justification to use quarantine powers. These powers may be warranted to prevent the continued transmission of a disease that presents a serious risk to the population. It is important, however, that restrictive powers are not used unnecessarily or as an artifice for discrimination [51] . Past quarantines in the United States have led to violence [52] , increased disease transmission among the quarantined population [53] , and biased decision making [54] . In one case, a federal court invalidated a quarantine imposed on an area of San Francisco comprised mostly of persons of Chinese descent, finding that the public health officials had used an ''evil eye and an unequal hand'' in issuing their quarantine order [55] .",

Barbera et al. list three key questions to consider when evaluating a quarantine decision: ''(1) do public health and medical analyses warrant the imposition of large-scale quarantine?

Case reporting is a form of passive surveillance involving the routine submission of data to a public health agency by external sources such as health care professionals and laboratories, often pursuant to mandatory legal requirements [56, 57] . Through disease surveillance and reporting, public health authorities may assess the magnitude of the outbreak and appropriately target resources and tactics [21] . Surveillance and case reporting raise privacy concerns since the reports usually contain identifiable data, which could include a person's name or other identifying characteristics. While using anonymous data instead of identifiable information is preferable to protect privacy, personal identifiers may be necessary to effectively track cases in some circumstances.",
