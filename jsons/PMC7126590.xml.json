            "text": "Despite the poor global economic performance and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 in the US, the number of international tourists traveling worldwide reached 715 million in 2002, an increase of 21 million from 2001 for an annual growth of 3.1 percent (World Tourism Organization, 2002). Global tourism receipts were 475.8 billion in US dollars (US$) for 2000 and 462 billion US$ for 2001. Tourist spending, as an alternative form of exports, can contribute to the balance of payments through foreign exchange earnings and proceeds generated from tourism expansion and can represent a significant income source for a national economy (Balaguer & Cantavella\u2013Jorda, 2002). Foreign exchange earnings from tourism can also be used to import capital goods to produce goods and services, which in turn leads to economic growth (McKinnon, 1964). Other economic benefits derived from tourism activity include tax revenues, employments and additional sources of income (Archer, 1995; Belisle & Hoy, 1980; Davis, Allen, & Consenza, 1988; Durbarry, 2002; Khan, Seng, & Cheong, 1990; Uysal & Gitelson, 1994; West, 1993). It is generally assumed that tourism expansion should have a positive contribution to economic growth.",

After Balaguer and Cantavella-Jorda's (2002) work, Oh (2005) counter-argued that the existence of the tourism-led growth hypothesis in Spain may be attributed to the fact that Spain is one of the world's top recipients of international tourist revenues. Tourism earnings in Spain comprise approximately 5.9 percent of its GDP (World Tourism Organization, 2000). The author used South Korea as a destination country for comparison. Although South Korea and Spain are both developing countries, the tourism industry in South Korea is not as strong as Spain. For example, value-added revenue derived from tourism-related activities accounts for 3.5 percent of South Korea's GDP (Bank of Korea, 2002). In his study, the cointegration analysis indicated no long-run link between tourism receipts and economic growth in South Korea over the period from 1975 to 2001. He further found an economic-driven tourism growth instead of a tourism-led economic growth, thereby implying that in South Korea, economic growth led tourism expansion rather than tourism expansion causing economic growth.",

To match the time period with TOUR, the quarterly GDP was chosen from the first quarter of 1971 to the second quarter of 2003. The annual series of TOUR were available from 1956 to 2002. For the same reason, the annual GDP data were selected beginning from 1956 to 2002. Then, TOUR and GDP data were transformed by the use of natural logarithms (LTOUR and LGDP) to ease interpretation of coefficients. Coefficients in the log function indicate a percentage change in a dependent variable given a percentage change in an independent variable.

Since the coefficient in the log function implies a percentage change in the dependent variable given a percentage change in the independent variable, the results can be further interpreted as follows: a 5% increase in tourism arrivals leads to a 0.1% increase in GDP and a 5% increase in GDP also causes a 0.1% increase in tourism arrivals.",

Most foreign firms were not allowed in the Korean market until South Korea became wide open in the mid 1990s after joining the WTO (World Trade Organization).

No strict travel regulations have ever existed in Taiwan. The reason for this may be explained by one distinctive difference in the economic system between the two nations. Small and medium-sized companies play a key role in Taiwan whereas large conglomerates lead South Korea (Feenstra, Yang, & Hamilton, 1999). In South Korea, it is perhaps sufficient for a few selected people such as key managers in the trading division of large corporations to have a privilege to travel abroad. However, in Taiwan, many small independent entrepreneurs may have to make international business trips. If strict travel rules are given to these ordinary people who own such companies, their businesses will be hampered and further national economic growth will be influenced negatively. The countries with more open societies such as Taiwan are, therefore, more likely to stimulate both inbound and outbound travels, which in turn boost economic growth.",
