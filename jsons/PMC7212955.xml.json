Like the previous pandemics, the unimaginable mental sufferings such as depression, panic, trauma, adjustment disorder, etc. are reported in general people as well as healthcare professionals (Ahorsu et al., 2020, Frank et al., 2020, Jahanshahi et al., 2020, Montemurro, 2020). These psychiatric sufferings are also accounted for about 90% of the global suicide occurrences in the extreme cases (Mamun & Griffiths, 2020b). Thus, suicide rate increment during and afterwards a pandemic is not highly unexpected, but more common. For instance, the COVID-19 fear leads to suicide completion that is reported in Pakistan\u2019s neighborhood countries like Bangladesh, India (e.g., Goyal et al., 2020, Mamun and Griffiths, 2020a). Besides, another non-representative study utilizing only 7-cases claims that the global COVID-19 suicide risk factors to be \u2013 (i) social isolation and distancing, (ii) economic recession, (iii) mental problems among healthcare professional, and (iv) social boycott and discrimination etc. (Thakur & Jain, 2020). The study is not representative as of it does not consider the COVID-19 suicide cases based on either global or a representative country. Hence, the conclusion of the global COVID-19 risk factors is arguably limited by selecting one suicide case for each causality, that also limits in overrating the prominent risk factors more generally in the crisis time. Besides, the decreasing of German Finance Minister is reported for economic recession suicide case rather than considering the general economic recession victims, that is totally unable to convey the evidence of lockdown-related economic recession suicides among the general people (Thakur & Jain, 2020). These non-representative and selective findings lead us to investigate the actual COVID-19 suicide causalities by considering all the COVID-19 suicide cases from a developing country (e.g., Pakistan).",

Since January 2020, a total 29 suicide cases were reported in Pakistani press media (i.e., news reports in both English and Urdu languages). Of these, 16 suicidality cases (i.e., 12 completions and four attempts) were directly related to COVID-19 issues and were included in this study. About 12 were males,13 victims had suffered from economic recession and only three were feared of COVID-19 infection (Table 1\n).",

Any destructions in economic cycle leads to lower gross domestic product and higher unemployment rates in a country. The economic recessions are estimated to affect significantly on the people mental health and wellbeing by magnitude the relative and attributable risks. Research indicates a significant adverse effect of job loss and unemployment on mental health sufferings like depression, anxiety, stress etc. (Rafi et al., 2019), which act as the mediators of suicide attempt and completion (Mamun & Griffiths, 2020b). Based on a systematic review, 31 global studies exhibit a positive association between economic recession and increased suicide rates (Oyesanya et al., 2015). However, the present findings also support the previous literatures of increasing suicide rates during the financial crisis and economic constraints in the lockdown.",

For the Pakistani economy, was projected by the Asian Development Bank to decrease by 3.3% in 2019 to 2.6 % by 2020, and this inflation likely to persist around 11.5% for 2020 (Augustine, 2020). Presently, Pakistan is facing many challenges including poverty, food insecurity and unceasing natural and manmade disasters etc. The country has a 24% of the total population living below the national poverty line and 38.8% are poor based on the Multidimensional Poverty Index (Humanitarian Response, 2019). This nastiest situation is also reflected in food security as a bleak picture. For instance, 20.5% of the total population is reported to be undernourished during the 2015-2017 time-period according to a recent report (Humanitarian Response, 2019).
