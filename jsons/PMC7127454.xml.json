Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis usually follows an infection of the upper respiratory tract. Numerous pathogens have been associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. For instance, viruses that have been implicated in this disorder include measles, rubella, varicella, influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, Coxsackie virus, coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and West Nile virus. Other organisms associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis include hemolytic streptococcus (group A), Mycoplasma pneumonia, and leptospirosis [1], [2]. Previous studies established that the influenza virus also represents a common causative agent of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. However, only a few cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis secondary to influenza A (H1N1) virus have been reported in the literature [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].",

At that time, he presented with fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough that began 5 days before admission. The boy was previously healthy, and he reported no history of any recent exposure to other medications, toxic substances, or previous vaccinations. Furthermore, the medical history of his family was unremarkable. The physical examination of the boy revealed mild tachycardia and pharyngeal hyperemia. A subsequent neurologic examination indicated the presence of confusion, lethargy, quadriplegia, and a bilateral extensor plantar response. Although a laboratory evaluation revealed a low leukocyte count (1910/mm3), his serum C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Cranial computed tomography was performed, and the findings were unremarkable. Likewise, an examination of the patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid produced normal results, except for mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (100 cells/mm3, all mononuclear, with normal protein and glucose), and the findings of an electroencephalogram were also unremarkable. Acyclovir and ceftriaxone were administered to the boy empirically. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were then performed with a 1.5 T system (Siemens Magnetron Symphony, Erlangen, Germany). Magnetic resonance imaging indicated T2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the globus pallidus and cerebellar dentate nucleus and periaqueductal white matter bilaterally. After an intravenous injection of gadolinium, minimal enhancement was detected. In diffusion weighted images, no loss of diffusion was evident. However, magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no lactate peak corresponding to these lesions (Fig 1\n). Serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were normal, and his oligoclonal bands also tested negative.",

Serum markers for viruses (i.e., herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Varicella zoster, mumps, rubella, measles, and Epstein-Barr virus) as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia produced negative results. However, influenza A (swine origin H1N1 serotype) was detected in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen by enzyme immunoassay on day 6, and oseltamivir was administered to the boy. Because of the persistence of neurologic signs, intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/day) was initiated on day 23 after admission, and was administered for 2 days. During a follow-up examination at the end of treatment, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and revealed a significant regression of the lesions (Fig 2\n). The boy was subsequently discharged with anarthria and quadriparesis on day 34 after admission. A follow-up appointment revealed that the boy continued to manifest anarthria and quadriparesis 2 years after the initial attack.",

Although unfavorable outcomes were mostly related to pulmonary complications, neurologic complications can occur after respiratory tract infections with the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus [8]. The literature has established that the influenza virus is a common causative agent of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
