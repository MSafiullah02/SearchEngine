However, novel diagnostics is only one of the strategies needing development as we come towards the end of antibiotics. Discussion in the Lancet ID has focused on the need for a global response to the global problem of antibiotic resistance following the recent report from the Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission.2, 3\n",

Randomized controlled studies in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) evaluated two new glycopeptide antibiotics for treating bacterial skin infection.4, 5 A single intravenous dose of oritavancin was non-inferior to twice daily intravenous vancomycin over seven to 10 days.4 Similarly, one weekly intravenous dose of dalbavancin was non-inferior to daily vancomycin followed by linezolid.5 Clearly, a single or weekly dose of antibiotics is preferable for a number of reasons, not least the patient's convenience! The discovery of truly novel antibiotics is limited by the fact that most potential bacterial targets are covered by other agents. A new insight into the construction of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide published in Nature could spur novel drug discovery.6\n",
