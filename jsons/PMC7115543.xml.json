The rapid pace of spread of virus through the capital cities of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, with cases doubling almost weekly through the summer of 2014, and the potential for international dissemination, necessitated an alternative development schema. Through a massive collaborative effort between government, academia and the pharmaceutical industry, multiple vaccines and therapeutic candidates were rapidly advanced into clinical development \u2013 with two vaccines reaching advanced testing and a viral-vectored vesicular stomatitis vaccine (VSV) [1], [2] demonstrating protection of at-risk individuals [3].",

Second, scale up of vaccine production occurred \u201cat-risk\u201d and prior to large-scale safety and immunogenicity assessments. Third, and importantly was the need for novel clinical trial study designs for Phase II/III studies in the face of an ever changing epidemiology. The ring vaccination strategy used for the VSV-EBOV vaccine utilized a staged approach whereby immediate contacts of cases of Ebola virus infection were randomized to early (immediate) vs late (delayed by 21 days) inoculation [3]. While clinical trials proceeded relatively quickly, early pre-clinical development was significantly challenged by the lack of funding which necessitated moving partially tested vaccines into clinical practice during a period of increasing international panic [4]. The Ebola vaccine trials were additionally challenged by ethical concerns of whether and how to include a control arm, societal mistrust of foreign entities conducting clinical trials, and the fact that the Ebola outbreak was in decline by the time vaccine studies commenced. Vaccine developers also had concerns regarding significant costs related to vaccine development, production, and clinical trial conduct for unknown commercialization potential.",

MERS-CoV is a Group C betacoronavirus with a clinical presentation of a rapidly progressive severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, renal failure, neurologic compromise, and cardiac arrhythmias [5], [6], [7]. MERS shares many similarities with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a Group B betacoronavirus. However, whereas SARS was considered highly lethal with a mortality rate of \u223c10%, the mortality rate for MERS is almost 40% - akin to the recent 2014\u20132015 Ebola epidemic. The epidemic potential for MERS-CoV was made readily apparent in the summer of 2015 when an outbreak in South Korea involving 186 individuals ensued from an index case of a businessman returning from Saudi Arabia; 20% of infected individuals died during the Korean outbreak, [8]. And finally, Zika virus, discovered in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947, was unknown outside of equatorial Africa and tropical Southeast Asia until 2009 when it began its relentless spread Eastward across the South Pacific [9], [10], [11], and eventually landing in Brazil with reports commencing in March 2015 [12], [13]. While Zika virus infection is typically self-limited and may even be subclinical, causing a syndrome significantly milder than chikungunya or dengue, Zika\u2019s propensity for neurologic complications such as the Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome [14], [15], as well as microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities among fetuses for women infected during pregnancy [16], [17], [18] has riveted international attention on this illness [19].",

Each has a different epidemiology, distinct mechanisms of transmission, and target risk groups. Clinical trial design and power calculations are intimately related to both the attack rate as well as the fraction of the population that are na\u00efve to infection. One unique consideration with each of these illness is the fact that the epidemiology of each outbreak was changing in real time that poses significant challenges to trial design and implementation. These logistical and design concerns need to be considered within the context of societal and local mores that can affect the ability to conduct a clinical trial. In this paper, we discuss some aspects of rational trial design that focuses the Ebola, MERS-CoV, and Zika epidemic outbreaks as models for vaccine development and alternative trial design.",

Examples include influenza H1N1 and the avian H7N9 influenza with increased propensity for mortality, and the H3N2 variant outbreak that caused infection in age groups (40\u201359 years of age) not typically associated with more severe illness. While Ebola virus was not new, the 2014 outbreak involved a much greater geography with a much higher potential for international spread and could be technically labelled as \u201cre-emergent\u201d. Zika virus infection is neither new, having been discovered in 1947, nor re-emergent as it has remained endemic in Asia and Africa, but has newly recognized comorbidities and complications as well as spread into the Western Hemisphere. At the other end of the spectrum are diseases such as MERS-CoV that represent completely new pathogens, as a genetically novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 [20].",

The high mortality rate of Ebola and MERS and the fetal malformations related to Zika, resulted in international clamor for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutics. Among these three, Zika has a unique critical need for a vaccine as the primary means to combat disease-related complications. For both Ebola virus and MERS, therapeutic small molecules should be able to interrupt disease pathogenesis and morbidity as Ebola has a 7\u201321 incubation period before the onset of clinical illness and MERS patients have between 1 and 5 days prior to clinical deterioration following diagnosis that could allow an effective therapeutic to abort infection. In contrast, for pregnant women who present with Zika infection, diagnosis typically follows the onset of rash and the peak of viremia and after fetal infection has likely occurred. Thus, preventive measures for Zika are uniquely reliant on an effective vaccine.",

Although the pathogenesis of SARS had been well characterized in the decade since its discovery, many lessons were not applicable to MERS. SARS was known to infect cells through binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [21], [22]. The fact that ACE2 is expressed widely in mammalian species allowed for murine and other mammalian animal models to assess candidate vaccines. In contrast, MERS is phylogenetically restricted to primates, camelids, and bats binding to the cell surface dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4), which while universally expressed in mammals, the receptor binding domain differs between susceptible and non-susceptible species [23]. This species restriction meant that rodents were not a useful model system unless induced to express primate DPP4 either through adenoviral transfection [24] or gene exchange [25], [26]. Transfected and transgenic mice while permissive to infection have been suboptimal, whereas camels or alpacas develop infection [27], [28] but are expensive and represent difficult model systems. Primates such as macaques [29], [30] or marmosets [31] develop self-limited illness but are expensive and with multiple barriers to use.",

In fact, neurologic consequences of disease have been known for greater than 4 decades as a study published in 1971 demonstrated histopathologic destruction of CNS tissue following infection of mice [38].

However, studies presented to date raise question as to validity of this assumption. For example, a clinical trial was completed that compared supportive therapy (standard of care, SOC) to SOC plus the use of hyperimmune, convalescent serum taken from recovered patients for the treatment of Ebola virus infection [47]. The study showed no survival benefit for those administered hyperimmune serum. One limitation of the study was that the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in donor serum was unknown. For MERS, the development of neutralizing antibodies does not predict viral clearance [48] although one small study did suggest a potential correlation between neutralization titers and outcome [49]. Importantly, indirect evidence against a role for neutralizing antibodies to protect against future disease is the observation that new infections continue to be documented for those with camel exposure (http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016\u201308-8\u2013001.aspx), a group for whom repeated and ongoing exposure should be the norm and for whom immune responses against MERS are well documented [50]. While the B-cell response against coronaviruses such as SARS quickly over time [51], MERS antibodies are detected up to three years post-infection in most [52]. Whether the latter represent neutralizing antibodies was not specified. Immune correlates of Zika virus protection are still being elucidated, but protection of immunocompetent mice from viremia with binding antibodies alone was suggested by one DNA vaccine study that yielded minimal neutralization titers [53].",

For EIDs (and for any other infection), it is important to be able to exclude individuals who have prior disease exposure and/or who become infected after enrollment but prior to when immunity is expected to develop.

Assessment of vaccine efficacy is dependent upon being able to compare vaccine recipients to those receiving placebo. During the Ebola outbreak, late phase vaccine and therapeutic trials were complicated as to consensus of what constituted an adequate control arm against which to measure efficacy and whether it was ethical to even include a control arm [62]. The competing needs of therapeutic intervention versus proof of therapeutic efficacy stymied decision making. As one cannot predict efficacy a priori, the need to control for response related to vaccine is imperative. The compromise reached as part of the ring vaccination trial was to randomize primary cases into immediate versus delayed (by the 21 day incubation period for Ebola) groups. The study met study goals and was terminated early [3].",

For both the MERS and Zika virus epidemics, epidemiologic studies occurred (or are being conducted) in parallel with vaccine development. It is also key to understand the \u201cmicro-epidemiology\u201d of disease. For example forMERS, while certain areas of Saudi Arabia are known as \u201chot spots\u201d for disease, the random nature of new cases and spread within new environs raises critical logistical considerations for a ring vaccination study design. And for Zika, it is known that within cities and regions transmission and incidence rates may vary widely from neighborhood to neighborhood \u2013 again posing challenges to clinical trial design. Additionally, one needs to detail key risk groups for disease transmission and whether these groups differ from those at most risk for illness or disease complications. For example, for Zika while all are considered at risk within endemic regions, vaccination will be targeted to women of child-bearing potential and their sexual partners.
