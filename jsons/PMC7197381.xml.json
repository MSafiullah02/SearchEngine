It starts from the Tangula Mountain region, app. 5, 170 m high, in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region of Qinghai, China. The Yangtze river is the longest river in Asia running downhill from the HKH region to the Yellow Sea eventually. And before its water slows down -running from the mountains \u2013 eventually it accumulates in Poyang Lake. Several other large lakes and wetland systems are also linked with Poyang Lake and its watershed acting as a natural buffer. Those lakes are Daguan Lake, Longgan Lake, Changhu Lake, Pohu Lake, Huanghu Lake and Junshan Lake for instance. Eventually, several rivers from there end up in the Yellow Sea running by the famous and ancient cities like Kaifeng and Shanghai. These cities have a large human, often global, history and legacy (Elvin 2006). The Yellow Sea \u2013 as a tidal mudflat system linking with the Chinese Sea \u2013 is not short of its own records but now also in big environmental troubles (MacKinnon et al. 2012).",

There are many mysteries about this lake and its inherent processes. Irrigation projects have been carried out for centuries (Fig. 6.2). To no surprise Poyang Lake plays that big role in the Asian culture, and the HKH region upstream is a direct driver for this watershed, including its weather (some details in Fei et al. (2016)).

For instance, Poyang Lake awaits an assessment that is done with an Ecological Economics perspective (e.g. Czech and Daly 2004; Daly and Farley 2010; see also Czech et al. 2000; Huettmann 2014). That\u2019s because it should be emphasized that most western-style research comes from an capitalistic ideology usually involving NGOs, whereas China pursues a marxist-leninist governance scheme and tends to run a different science concept and institution. Thus, aim, culture, perceptions and outcome do differ. But where there is less difference and good agreement is in the concept that wetlands are of global relevance and provide ecological services to the global community! Climate and migratory species are a good example for that, and so is food security, water supply, waste, contamination and ecological cleansing, or the human need to have recovery areas to engage with nature (Table 6.1).",

            "text": "The large water system of Poyang Lake was used by local fishermen in relatively low harvests for millennia. However, during different regimes these methods and concepts have changed: It went from wilderness to an indigenous and Asian feudal system to the Chinese empires, foreign dominations, and then, an almost century-long communistic regime, and now, a new exploitive capitalistic development focus also using computing power and remote sensing as well as globalization (Diamond 1999; Elvin 2006). Like elsewhere in the world, essentially a devastating cash economy now rules the resource management (Fig. 6.1, Czech et al. 2004). Another major impact came simply with monofilament (plastic) nets in the 1970s creating havoc in the ecosystem, e.g. small net sizes, bycatch and unregulated poaching all happening on a dramatic scale. And like elsewhere in Asia it is known that nets are not only used under water but also on land catching there songbirds (incidentally but in large and persistent numbers). In both cases, this is an indiscriminate catch and thus very devastating, specifically when it occurs on a vast landscape-scale without relevant enforcement to stop it entrenched as a culture and somewhat institutionalized in the \u2018status quo\u2019. Such catching is still ongoing to this very day (see for instance recent campaign by Audubon Society http://www.audubon. org/magazine/may-june-2014/fighting-bird-poachers-chinas-poyang-lake). Consequently, the natural resource pays the price. Primarily, that is the freshwater fish that gets reduced, but also several endangered species are among those, and certainly the ecosystem overall and virtually all of the ecological services. The finless porpoise, a small cetacean from the Yangtze River, is already heavily reduced and could get extinct (https://www.chinadialogue. net/article/show/ single/en/839-Poyang-Lake-saving-the-finless-porpoise; Fang et al. 2006 for context). Songbirds are in generic decline in Asia, especially in China (Jiao et al. 2016; see Kamp et al. 2015 for 90% population crashes). Another widely forgotten side-aspect are the millions of unnamed migratory waterbirds that make use of Poyang Lake as a resting and winter grounds. Simply by \u2018developing\u2019 Poyang Lake the wintering habitats for those species are sacrificed further, just like their food items. Such wilderness systems are on an overall and consistent decline, so are the surrounding areas, flyways and by now the atmosphere overall (Table 6.2).",

Aside of generic river bed destruction sand mining is said to be a major cause for the massive decline of the finless porpoise (https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/839-Poyang-Lake-saving-the-finless-porpoise). Other factors associated with those developments are the excessive use of herbicides, insecticides and pesticides (see Fig. 6.3 for examples and evidence); many other parts of the world ban such type of use of those problematic substances and in that amount. It will leave impacts on the wider food chain, certainly on the food source for many species \u2013 insects and plankton \u2013 which the spraying is to reduce. Long-term impacts are not so well known, yet but one may assume they are very serious and to be pre-cautionary is suggested (Fig. 6.4, Table 6.3).",

The affiliated culture is equally in transition. Smaller enforcement of compliance might look and sound impressive but hardly can fix the problems anymore. Perhaps the destruction can be halted\u2026in 100 years or more and some base features might remain by then. But even if local processes can get under control, the destructions upstream in the HKH region must also be addressed, namely globalization, dams, human expansion and climate change resulting into water loss, massive  glacier melt and warming. And judged by the consistent but ongoing failures of climate agreement and COP meetings, and the dominance of neoliberal mind sets on global governance (e.g. Huettmann 2012, 2014) the real-world outlook to stop those processes seems to be slim for the next 100 years or so. This will all be very costly too (Wang et al. 2013). It\u2019s part of a wider western template of nature destruction (Czech et al. 2004). We shall see then what will remain under such global governance.
