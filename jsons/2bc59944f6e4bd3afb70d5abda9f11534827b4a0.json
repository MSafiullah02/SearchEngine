Nevertheless, CNS compromise remains uncommon, but its associated morbidity and mortality are quite high. Even for immunocompetent hosts, the cure rate for patients receiving antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis is around 75% and is only 25% for aspergillosis and mucormycosis (Perdigao et al. 2004 ). Fungal infections have been recognized historically, but CNS fungal infections have been recognized recently. The first description of a fungal infection is attributed with Hippocrates, in his book Of the Epidemics (400 B.C.E.) (The Library of Victoria University, Toronto n.d.), in which he described white patches in the oral cavity of a debilitated patient (candidiasis). Zenkar in 1861 described a fatal case of intracerebral candidiasis, and Smith and Sano were the first reporting a case of Candida meningitis in 1933 (Segal and Elad 2010) .",

Therefore, diagnosis of infection versus colonization with these fungi is a common issue that has important treatment implications (Guarner and Brandt 2011) . Moreover, advances in diagnostic imaging and specific patient support have permitted the possibility of collecting biopsy specimens for histological examination from sites previously not reachable; nevertheless, these advantages come with challenges related to the limited amount of tissue obtained and the architectural distortion produced by the procedure (Gavito-Higuera et al. 2016) .",

However, this demonstration requires a brain biopsy, which is one of the most important limitations (De Pauw et al. 2008) . Frequently, fungi when present in tissue are not easily visible using routine stains; thus, Gomori methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining can be used to improve their visibility and allow a better morphological identification (Schwartz et al. 2018; De Pauw et al. 2008) . Some microscopic fungal characteristics can allow its identification to a genus level. For example, Aspergillus species can be differentiated from Mucorales by their septate, dichotomous branching hyphae, whereas Mucorales have an irregular shape of mostly uniseptate or pauciseptate hyphae. Some organisms show specific morphological characteristics, which can help in their identification. For example, H. capsulatum are small intracellular, budding yeasts; B. dermatiti-dis are thick-walled, broad-based budding yeasts; P. brasiliensis is big yeasts with small yeasts attached given a so-called pilot-wheel configuration; and Coccidioides species manifest themselves as large spherules that contain endospores (De Pauw et al. 2008; McCarthy et al. 2014) .",

DL Rosa R.M.)) that reproduce asexually producing conidia ( Fig. 6 .1b, d (Courtesy of Z. DL Rosa R.M.)) (Bennett 2009 ). These fungi are ubiquitous and have been used for centuries for industrial proposes. This genus is able to survive in a variety of habitats from leaf litter to human tissues. The most frequent species associated with human disease is A. fumigatus, and other species, such as A. niger, cause disease in immunosuppressed individuals. Aspergillus fungi produce three particular clinical entities: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis/ aspergilloma, and invasive or systemic aspergillosis (Riscili and Wood 2009) . Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis generally occurs in critically immunosuppressed patients, including patients with prolonged neutropenia, organ transplant recipients, patients with AIDS, premature newborns, and patients with chronic granulomatous disease (Sherif and Segal 2010) . Aspergillus spp. are one of the most frequent fungi isolated from neurological infections, most infections of the CNS are due to A. fumigatus, which gets into the CNS by hematogenous spread from the primary site of infection (lungs) or from contiguous anatomical sites, such as the paranasal sinuses (McCarthy et al. 2014) . Focal lesions or a brain abscess are the predominant findings (Barrera-Herrera et al. 2015) , while cerebral infarction caused by septic embolism, vascular thrombosis, or mycotic aneurysms are less frequent (McCarthy et al. 2014) , and meningitis (without parenchymal involvement) is rarely reported (Antinori et al. 2013) . Microscopically, Aspergillus spp. are thin (3-12 \u03bcm), septate, acute-angle (45\u00b0), or dichotomous branching hyphae ( Fig. 6 .1a, c), and when present in cavitary lesions, vesicles with conidia can be also identified ( Fig. 6.1b, d) .",

(2006) , 56% of the cases were caused by Aspergillus spp., 25% of them had a positive culture, and the majority of patients were immunocompetent. The most common source of spreading was continuity from sinuses, orbit or ear, followed by the hematogenous route; however, in eight cases, no source of infection was identified. Histologically, granulomas and dense fibrosis were the most frequent features. Eight cases presented isolated intracerebral granulomas; fibrosis was less marked in these lesions. The granulomas observed differed from tuberculous granulomas by the prominence of multinucleated giant cells, an abundance of neutrophils and plasma cells with lymphocytes and few epitheloid cells and marked fibrosis. Microscopic identification of the fungus was performed on GMS and PAS, and the culture positivity was 25%. The most common isolated organisms were A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, and A. terreus. Lee et al. (2010) reported a series of 393 patients with evidence of fungal infection on histologic examination (a total of 231 (58.8%) were rhinocerebral infections); they analyzed the culture-histology concordance of filamentous fungi in 122 specimens; they showed concordance in 83% on cases with septated, acute-anglebranching hyphae and the presence of Aspergillus spp. in culture; Fusarium spp., Trichophyton spp., and others were recovered in culture from the discordant cases. Among the Aspergillus species isolated, A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. nidulans, and A. terreus were identified.",

Historically, these molds have been called Zygomycota (not used anymore) and Mucorales; therefore, the disease is known as mucormycosis or zygomycosis. Currently, it is accepted that the subphylum Mucoromycotina has two orders, the Mucorales and the Entomophthorales. The former was originally identified as affecting insects and causing mucocutaneous disease in immunocompetent human hosts, while the Mucorales cause a spectrum of predominantly angioinvasive disease in immunosuppressed patients ( Fig. 6 .3f (Courtesy of A. Agudelo M.D.)). Among the Mucorales, Rhizopus is the most frequent genus that causes human disease; conversely, Mucor spp. produce disease in less than 20% of cases (Naggie and Perfect 2009 ).",

Their spores are easily airborne, frequently causing contamination in the laboratory; considering this, isolation of these molds must be correlated with the clinical history, in order to define their clinical significance. Inhaled spores can produce respiratory disease in immunosuppressed individuals, and the spores can also invade the skin and subcutaneous tissue by traumatic inoculation, contaminated needles, and even insect bites; less commonly, spores can be swallowed and cause gastrointestinal disease (Prabhu and Patel 2004) . When the immune response is not able to control the initial infection, the spores germinate and invade the surrounding tissue. Initially, there is an edematous reaction, and by the time the hyphae invade blood vessels, (Fig. 6 .3f) the tissue becomes necrotic and acquires a characteristic black color. By contrast, immunocompetent individuals develop an intense inflammatory response and can present with a mass in the skin, respiratory sinuses, or the gastrointestinal tract (Roilides et al. 2014) .",

When immunosuppressed patients develop disseminated disease, it is usual to observe sheets of macrophages filled with yeasts ( Fig. 6.4b, c) . The abundance of macrophages distorts the organ architecture and produces necrotic areas. Considering that the morphology of H. capsulatum is not specific, it is important to always perform clinical-epidemiologic correlation (Kauffman 2008 In addition to the mentioned fungi, some parasites can also appear morphologically similar to Histoplasma spp., agents of leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, and Chagas' disease, which also show intracellular organisms (Gupta et al. 2009 ). One of the most relevant histopathologic differences between these protozoans and Histoplasma is that H&E stains the entire organism, and none of them show the halo produced by the fungal cell wall. Kinetoplasts (a distinct hematoxylinstained bar located to the side of the nucleus that represents a mass of mitochondrial DNA) should be observed in the cases of Leishmania or Trypanosoma infections. Finally, it is important to remember when toxoplasmosis and Chagas' disease are suspected, that the infected cells are somatic (cardiomyocytes or neurons) rather than macrophages. In summary, to perform a definitive diagnosis of histoplasmosis from tissue sections is challenging, and if cultures were not requested, alternative testing must be demanded.",

There are two primary species that cause the disease. Coccidioides immitis is endemic in some parts of the United States, particularly in the California desertic areas (Adam et al. 2009 ); additionally, Coccidioides posadasii is present in desertic regions of the United States (Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and West Texas), northwest Mexico, and desertic zones in Argentina, Paraguay, and areas of Central America (Colombo et al. 2011; Ampel 2009 ). Nevertheless, differences in morphology or clinical presentation have been found between the entities produced by each species. An interesting correlation between the incidence of the disease and specific environmental factors is commonly reported; for example, coccidioidomycosis incidence increases when there are rainy summers followed by dry winters, after earthquakes, or when humans establish themselves on the previously recognized endemic areas. Thus, when any of these situations take place, Coccidioides arthrospores are released in higher concentrations compared with the usual baseline (Parish and Blair 2008) .",

It is estimated that approximately 60% of infected people have no symptoms, while the remainder may present a clinical condition that simulates an acute community-acquired pneumonia, also known as \"valley fever\" (Adam et al. 2009; Ampel 2009 Most of acute infections resolve with no complications; however, in a minority of patients, the infection may progress to a chronic condition, developing either a cavity or a nodule (Wheat et al. 2016) . It is recognized that specific risk groups (African Americans, Asians, pregnant women, patients with diabetes, patients receiving corticosteroids) are more likely to develop disseminated disease (Adam et al. 2009 ). The most common sites of extrapulmonary involvement are the skin, lymph nodes, bones, and joints; nevertheless, the most feared is the extension to the CNS (Kauffman 2008) . In those cases, the most frequent presentation is meningitis. Therefore, the usual imaging findings are meningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus, but focal brain lesions, infarcts, or areas of cerebritis or cerebellitis can also be observed (Lammering et al. 2013) .",

Initially, because skin manifestations of blastomycosis were very striking, it was considered a dermatologic condition (Gilchrist and Stokes 1898). The concept of airborne transmission was not recognized until pathologic descriptions allowed the pathophysiologic mechanisms to be elucidated (Sarosi and Davies 1979) . There are infrequent cases of direct cutaneous inoculation in laboratory workers and veterinarians, but virtually all cases of blastomycosis are considered to originate primarily from lung disease (Sarosi and Davies 1979) . The etiological agent is the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The organism exists in nature in the mold or mycelial phase and converts to the yeast phase in tissues at body temperature ( Fig. 6.7a, b) . The mold is the infective form, producing conidia that can be aerosolized and subsequently inhaled. In culture, B. dermatitidis grows from 25 to 28 \u00b0C as a mold and at 37 \u00b0C as a yeast (Nemecek et al. 2006) . This fungus has been isolated from soil in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, around the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River, which include multiple states in the United States (southeastern, south central, and upper Midwestern states); it has also been found in several Canadian provinces (McKinnell and Pappas 2009) . Outbreaks of blastomycosis after a source exposure have been reported, but most cases occur sporadically in the endemic areas. Occasionally, cases are reported in areas where the disease is not endemic, such as Colorado, Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska in the United States, and from other countries around the world (Shukla et al. 2009 ).",

The sensitivity and specificity have been reported to be above 90%; nevertheless, cross-reactivity occurs in patients with histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and penicilliosis caused by P. marneffei (Durkin et al. 2004) . Because of the cross-reactivity, it is useful to perform antigen tests for both blastomycosis and histoplasmosis. Detection of antibodies to B. dermatitidis in serum using traditional complement fixation and immunodifusion has poor specificity and sensitivity; however, as antigens have been better purified and used in radioimmunodiffusion and EIAs, the sensitivity and specificity of serology are significantly higher (McKinnell and Pappas 2009).",

The broad spectrum in clinical and pathogenic presentation makes its diagnosis a big challenge. When a tissue or liquid specimen is available, the pathological analysis is a very useful tool for rapid and accurate diagnosis. Usually, pathological studies can provide results before the culture or other analyses are available. Nevertheless, it is important to remember the limitations of this approach because many of the fungal structures among different species are very similar. Therefore, it could be really easy to misdiagnose a specific fungal infection, which would have a relevant impact on therapy. Thus, it is always important to consider the clinical information, as well as complementary analysis, in order to obtain a definitive ethological diagnosis.",
