Consequently, ED nurses are the first healthcare professionals to care for patients infected with the novel contagious disease. In fact, there were many cases of exposure to the disease in EDs during the MERS-CoV outbreak [3]. Compared to nurses in other areas, ED nurses are faced with hectic, unpredictable, and ever-changing situations [4]. Because they deal with various diseases, traumatic events, and urgent situations, they do not have enough time for recovery, putting them under persistent stress. As a result, ED nurses are reported to experience much higher burnout than nurses in other hospital departments 5, 6, 7. Burnout is a long-term consequence of prolonged exposure to certain job demands and a reaction that appears when a person can no longer endure the stress they have been undergoing [8]. It is a syndrome of physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion that includes a negative self-concept and work attitude, and a reduced interest in patients [8]. It has also been strongly associated with working conditions in nursing 5, 6, 7, 8, leading it to be the focus of many nursing studies 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.",

According to a systematic review of 17 reports on emergency room (ER) nurses' burnout published over the past 25 years, 26.0% of them suffered from burnout [5]. Although varying between studies, the factors influencing burnout have been largely divided into individual factors and work-related factors 5, 9. Individual factors reported in previous studies include demographic characteristics such as gender, age, religion, education level 5, 9, having children, living with family [10], job stress 7, 11, personality, coping strategies, and job attitude 5, 9. Major work-related influencing factors are exposure to traumatic events, level of wages, social support, staffing, and lack of material resources 5, 9.",

            "text": "A nationwide outbreak of MERS-CoV is an unfamiliar traumatic event for ED nurses, so there has been little research into MERS-CoV-related burnout. Similarly, when severe acute respiratory syndrome such as SARS spread rapidly, most nurses experienced severe stress, and some nurses refused to care for patients 12, 13. In addition, the factors influencing nurses' desire to leave their jobs during an outbreak of SARS were identified as the perceived risk of fatality from SARS, tenure, work stress, and social relationships [13]. When H5N1 avian flu spread rapidly, Taiwanese nurses' fear of infection from the disease was a significant factor influencing their willingness to care for patients infected with the avian flu [14]. Since an emerging respiratory infectious disease such as MERS-CoV can happen anywhere in the world, nursing managers need to pay attention to ED nurses' burnout in association with their experiences of a nationwide MERS-CoV outbreak. However, not even a basic survey has been conducted on the level of burnout experienced by ED nurses, who are in the front line taking care of MERS-CoV patients, or factors of burnout that consider the specific nature of MERS-CoV. Thus, this study attempted to assess ED nurses' burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout.",

Of all the participants, 223 replied to the survey (response rate 92.9%). After unanswered questionnaires were excluded, 215 questionnaires were used as valid data in this study.",

The outcome of this study is expected to provide basic information related to ED nurses' burnout in connection to an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as MERS-CoV and to contribute to programs and strategies for reducing burnout. In order to lower the level of burnout, nursing managers need to make efforts to reduce job stress, to reinforce hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV, and to promote support from family and friends. Particularly in the area of ED nursing, it is essential that we develop effective and systematic burnout management programs for monitoring and preventing burnout in preparation against possible future outbreaks of infectious diseases.",
