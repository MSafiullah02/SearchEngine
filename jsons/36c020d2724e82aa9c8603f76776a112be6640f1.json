The majority of patients, 19 (76%), had several comorbidities (in particular diabetes mellitus [32%], hypertension [64%] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [28%]).

In addition, survival and overcome from infection of cancer patients COVID-19-positive were evaluated compared with a control group of patients COVID-19-positive hospitalized in the same period comparable and matched by age, sex, pneumonia and antiviral treatment.",
