Although over 90% of those deaths and cases were concentrated in the People's Republic of China and its southeastern neighbours (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Vietnam), SARS infected people across the world, including such disparate and distant places as Canada, South Africa, and Romania. One of the striking features of the SARS epidemic was the manner in which airline networks acted as corridors for the spread of the disease (Peiris and Guan 2004).",

The catastrophic spread of bubonic plague in fourteenth century Eurasia was most rapid along trade routes across the Mediterranean Sea, taking much longer to move overland (Herlihy 1997). In nineteenth century America, the spread of cholera in three great epidemics (1832, 1844 and 1866) followed the transport routes of the time, spreading much more rapidly during the last epidemic along the nation's newly built railroad network (Pyle 1969). And more recently, \u2018Patient Zero\u2019, the somewhat misleading nickname given to a person who played an important role in the early spread of HIV/AIDS to North America (but was not necessarily the first person to do so), was a Canadian flight attendant (Gould 1993).",

Faster trips make it more likely that a person infected at the start of a journey will still be infectious at the end of that journey, severely weakening the epidemiological isolation afforded by distance (Cliff et al. 1998). In her influential book The coming plague, Garrett (1994, 571) put it more graphically, \u2018Thanks to changes in Homo sapiens activities, in the ways in which the human species lived and worked on the planet at the end of the twentieth century, microbes no longer remained confined to remote ecospheres or rare reservoir species: for them, the earth had truly become a Global Village\u2019. Indeed, diseases once limited mainly to developing countries are no longer as circumscribed (Mayer 2000), in part because one million people travel by air from developing to developed countries and vice versa per week.",

Among the most comprehensive studies examining the spatial spread of disease are two books by Cliff et al. (1998 , 2000). In Deciphering global epidemics (2000), they model geographic patterns in the incidence of six infectious diseases across 100 cities worldwide between 1888 and 1912. Transport networks, especially those of nineteenth century steamship lines, are mentioned in the book but play no role in their analyses. In Island epidemics (1998), which examined the disease record of populated islands across the world, air transport networks were analyzed as one factor shaping disease patterns. However, the link between the networks and disease was shown only with a single diagram, and no attempt was made to quantify this link or show how it was mediated by other factors such as the level of economic development, trade patterns, or immigration history.",

In one such study, that specifically incorporates the role played by air travel, Rvachev and Longini (1985) estimate the probability of diffusion based in part on the volume of international air traffic among 52 worldwide cities. They test the model against the 1968\u20139 Hong Kong flu pandemic and find that the predicted space\u2013time spread of the disease matches the actual experience fairly well. However, the authors concede that the difficulty in obtaining actual origin\u2013destination traffic flow data frustrates their efforts to fully assess the role of air travel in disease diffusion. Also, they indicate that to make the forecasts of their model more realistic, traffic data would have to be collected for three times as many cities as in their study. As described below, the methodology employed in the present study is less sensitive to the shortcomings of airline traffic data and includes a set of more than 200 sample cities.",

In a potential epidemic crisis, public health professionals can easily access complete airline schedules, but even rudimentary data on actual flown traffic are likely to be available only much later.

For example, the number of passengers departing Singapore (a key source of investment and managerial expertise) bound for China in May 2003 was nearly 90% lower than in May 2002 (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore 2002 , 2003). In response, China's Health Ministry finally issued a battery of \u2018Management Measures\u2019 in mid\u2010May 2003. These included strict new rules governing the handling of SARS cases, with the rules to be enforced by harsh, new court\u2010approved penalties for non\u2010compliance.

Visitors from Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada, staying on the same floor of the hotel as Hong Kong's index case, contracted the virus, and returned home aboard international flights.

            "text": "From these data, passenger health screening appears to coincide with the decrease in imported cases to the US. However, other variables may also have contributed to the decline in imported cases to the US from areas of local transmission, including the effective decrease in accessibility wrought by sharply lower passenger movements. For example, passenger traffic through Asia during the outbreak decreased by as much as 90% in Taiwan, 70% in Hong Kong and 55% in Singapore (Hendrickson 2003). A further complicating factor was the onset of summer in the northern hemisphere bringing warmer temperatures less favourable to the SARS virus.",

On the one hand, some of the world's best scientists, doctors, and other health professionals from across much of the world, linked by the latest in information technology, were able to isolate and characterize the SARS\u2010CoV rapidly (Heymann 2004; Weiss and McLean 2004). On the other hand, SARS spread rapidly via a global airline network that, a century on from the Wright Brothers\u2019 first flight, afforded unprecedented mobility. While it is true that the origin of the disease so close to Hong Kong made it especially prone to diffusion by air travel, and that a similar disease originating in Central Africa, for instance, would have spread more slowly (Weiss and McLean 2004), it is nevertheless apparent that the world was ill\u2010prepared to mitigate the diffusion of SARS via international air transport.",

While the threat of SARS was a global concern, the responses to contain SARS were heterogeneous across the affected countries. Infrared scanners in Singapore, mandatory quarantine in Taiwan and health notification cards in Toronto were all responses to mitigate the same disease. The WHO effectively established a global standard for containing the international spread of SARS to which nations compared their response efforts. Governments measured their containment efforts against WHO recommendations in press releases and, similarly, media reports either chastised or celebrated containment efforts, based on how they compared to those recommended by the WHO.",

The escalation of uneven country\u2010specific responses contributed to a sense of panic, especially in Asia, that was incommensurate with the true scale of the threat (McKercher and Chon 2004). Indeed, on a global scale, the 2003 outbreak of SARS was a minor killer (Weiss and McLean 2004), but it still took nearly a thousand lives; and its human toll was exacerbated by its vast financial cost, estimated at US$40 billion for the Asia\u2010Pacific region alone (Osterholm 2005). Should a future epidemic arise in which an emerging or re\u2010emerging disease is more easily transmissible than SARS, a more uniform and planned response could be crucial to limiting both the loss of life and the economic devastation wrought by an outbreak.",
