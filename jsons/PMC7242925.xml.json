The problem associated to fast transmission is associated to asymptomatic proportion in a city, near to 18%, investigated in a Diamond Princess cruise chip [3]. In the last month, some research papers have investigated the evolution of COVID-19 outbreak in Asia (China) [4] and Europe (Italy, France and Spain) [5]. This research have analyzed epidemic data made available on the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [6], the available data analyzed is considered between January 21th 2020 and April 12th 2020, included, with a feedback process in a neural network applied; it allows to examined the information in real time in each state, at Fig. 1\n, New York is the city with more infection around USA with 7,867 deaths and 172,348 total confirmed with COVID-19 with more than 800 new deaths. In this process, the government is implemented new strategies for COVID-19 control, however, it should consider a forecast according USA behavior.",

Finally, the COVID-19 forecast, performed as chaotic-dynamic system, has a good result than traditional models, because of the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. It uses the Lorenz\u2019s system displayed, so it seems like a paradox, where the system is both deterministic and unpredictable, because, you could never know the initial conditions with perfect accuracy, for the contagious pattern.",

Therefore, we think that the pandemic behaves as a dynamic-chaotic system, which sets new starting points that do not intersect and changes its behavior according to the way it is treated. Consequently, this study could be a real contribution for understanding this problem with a good tool of processing a systematic review. As we can see in the Fig. 9, the example started with three countries, with three initial states. Hence they have been evolving together until some days, but after a month, they diverge (e.g. Spain and Italy), due to the strategies implemented by the government as quarantine, closed frontiers and more constraints. From being arbitrarily close together, they end up on different trajectories; then, it demonstrates that depends on initial conditions and the actions taken. In the equations described in the section 2, there is nothing random at all about this system of equations, even if you could input exactly the same initial conditions, you would get exactly the same result.
