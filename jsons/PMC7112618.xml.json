            "text": "Lipids are loosely defined as biological molecules with hydrophobic or amphipathic properties that render them soluble in organic solvents [1]. Despite the fact that this definition includes thousands of different chemical structures, a more defined classification seemed unnecessary for a long period of time. Lipids were believed to have two general functions: a structural role in biomembranes and a role in energy storage in cells (lipid droplets) and body fluids (lipoproteins). During the last two decades, however, we have come to realize that lipids have a multitude of different and essential functions in the cell. First indications for the involvement of specific lipids in biological processes came from the identification of platelet-activating factor as a lipid molecule [2]. The groundbreaking work of Irvine and Berridge in the 1980s showed the involvement of lipids in intracellular cellular signaling by the generation of second messengers from phosphoinositides [3]. Almost concomitantly the discovery was made that diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid are biologically active lipids, as well as lipidic breakdown products of cellular sphingolipids [4], [5], [6], [7]. Since the identification of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein as an essential factor for protein trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in yeast in the early 1990s [8], an overwhelming body of evidence showed the involvement of lipids in the regulation of membrane traffic [9]. Lipids have also been implicated in the generation of lateral heterogeneity in biological membranes, creating membrane domains that are often referred to as lipid rafts [10]. By specific recruitment of proteins and lipids to these domains while excluding others, many biological processes such as cell migration, the immune system, and the cell cycle are affected or regulated.",

This multitude of functions makes lipids also an attractive target for pathogens. In the innate immune system, microbes can be internalized by a phagocytosis-like process in order to be degraded by the acidic environment in subsequent phagolysosomal compartments. Some pathogens, however, escape the immune system by interacting with the cellular machinery at any one of these steps, allowing their survival and multiplication. Today there are many indications for an important role of lipids in various stages of host\u2013pathogen interactions. One of the first examples for such involvement comes from the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that secretes the enterotoxin cholera toxin. The receptor of the toxin is a lipid termed GM1 [11]. This protein-lipid interaction results in the formation of a membrane pore, ultimately causing severe diarrhea.",

In the membrane of erythrocytes parasitized by Plasmodium falciparum the composition of individual phospholipid classes, as well as that of their fatty acid constituents is altered [17], [18], [19]. Fatty acid alterations are not observed in all lipid classes. Alterations in the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine of erythrocyte membranes were observed for Plasmodium knowlezi\n[20]. Intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium chabaudi is also associated with alterations in the overall fatty acid composition of the plasma membrane of the host cell [21], but not in that of the host cell\u2019s plasma membrane phosphatidylcholine [22]. At this moment it is not clear whether the observed alterations in fatty acid composition are due to enzymatic modifications in situ of the phospholipids in the plasma membrane of the erythrocyte, or to selective uptake of phospholipid molecular species from the erythrocyte plasma membrane by the parasite. Alterations in fatty acid composition of host cell lipids are not limited to parasitic infections. Changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition were also observed in mouse tissues after infection with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, an attenuated mutant of Mycobacterium bovis\n[23], while human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection of cultured lymphocytes was found to result in alterations of the fatty acid composition of the membrane lipids of the lymphocytes [24].",

            "text": "Pathogens can modify the fatty acid composition of host cell lipids in several ways. One way is the modulation of host cell fatty acid uptake from the environment. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) inhibits the uptake of short-chain fatty acids, as illustrated by inhibition of butyrate uptake into Caco-2 cells during infection [25]. Genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila cells infected by Listeria monocytogenes or Mycobacterium fortuitum indicated the involvement of a member of the CD36 family of scavenger receptors, which are presumed fatty acid translocases [26], [27]. A second way to modify the host cell fatty acid composition is the modulation of the activity or expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. RNAi screening in Drosophila SL2 cells indicated that infection by M. fortuitum or L. monocytogenes requires sufficient expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase [26]. Likewise, inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or fatty acid synthase in the host cells inhibits Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication [28], [29]. Moreover, during infection HCV induces an upregulation of the expression of mRNAs encoding enzymes of fatty acid synthesis [28], [29]. It is not clear whether alterations in expression levels of enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis also result in altered fatty acid profiles of membrane lipids. In the next sub-sections we will focus on a third way for pathogens to modulate the fatty acid composition of host cell lipids which involves phospholipase activities, lipase activities, and/or cholesterol acyltransferase activities to efficiently modify of the fatty acid composition of host cell lipids by fatty acid exchange.",

Based on the position within the phospholipid at which the cleavage takes place, they are classified into four major groups: phospholipase A, B, C and D (PLA, PLB, PLC and PLD, respectively). Phospholipases from bacteria, viruses and parasites act as virulence factors by modifying host cell lipids to their advantage [30], [31]. They exert their action by being involved in a variety of aspects of host\u2013pathogen interaction, such as causing membrane damage (hemolysis in the case of erythrocytes), entry into the host, and exit from vacuoles (Fig. 2\n). Phospholipases of pathogens may also be involved in acquisition of fatty acids for nutritional purposes (see Section 8), and activation of host signaling pathways to regulate the immune response (see Section 3). Lastly, pathogens can also trigger the activity of host cell phospholipases. Distinct isoforms of PLA2 were found to mediate the ability of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri to induce the transepithelial migration of neutrophils [32].",

ExoU injected into the host cell is cytotoxic. By lysing cell membranes it may contribute to the ability of Pseudomonas to disseminate rapidly from lung tissue into the bloodstream. However, the cellular effects of ExoU are not limited to localised cell death and tissue destruction. This protein triggers an arachidonic acid-dependent inflammatory cascade in vivo\n[38]. Recent data indicate that ExoU liberates the arachidonic acid from intracellular lipid droplets [39]. In addition, it activates several transcription factors that control proliferative responses and proinflammatory cytokine production (for review, see [30]. S. typhimurium injects an effector protein SseJ into the host cell cytoplasm from within a vacuole in which the bacterium resides after its uptake into the host cell. SseJ exhibits both PLA and glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase activity [40], [41]. The exact role of this enzyme, which is activated by as yet unidentified proteinaceous host cell factor(s), is not yet clear [40]. SseJ is not cytotoxic [42].",

A PLA2 of Helicobacter pylori plays a role in colonization of the gastric mucosa [53], [54]. A similar role may be played by a PLA secreted by Campylobacter pylori, which was shown to degrade phospholipids of gastric mucus [55]. The Plasmodium berghei phospholipase Pb PL is involved in migration of sporozoites through cells to gain entry into the bloodstream [56]. Pb PL is most similar in sequence to LCAT, a member of the PLA2 family of serine lipases. Like LCAT it contains the GxSxG motif found in many serine lipases, and the catalytic triad of serine, histidine and aspartate. The enzyme was shown to have PLA activity [56]. The penetration of host cells by Rickettsia rickettsii, R. prowazekii and R. conorii also appears to be mediated by a PLA2 of rickettsial origin [57], [58]. A PLA2 may also be involved in host cell invasion by the protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium parvum\n[59] and Toxoplasma gondii\n[60], [61]. PLB secreted by Cryptococcus neoformans is important in the binding of this fungus to human epithelial cells prior to its internalization, possibly due to the release of fatty acids from host cell plasma membranes or pulmonary surfactant [62].",

Clostridium perfringens escapes from its macrophage phagosome by use of its \u03b1-toxin (a PLC) in cooperation with its perfringolysin O, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin [65]. The combined action of phospholipase and a pore-forming protein in escape from the vacuole is also seen for the well-studied L. monocytogenes, an intracellular pathogen that replicates in the cytosol of host cells [63], [64]. After invasion into cells, L. monocytogenes escapes from its vacuole by the combined action of the pore-forming protein listeriolysin O (LLO) and a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (PI-PLC), both secreted by the bacterium [63], [64], [66], [67]. It has been suggested that LLO forms holes into the vacuole membrane, which allow L. monocytogenes phospholipase to access exposed membrane leaflet [63]. However, in a liposome lysis assay membrane permeabilization by L. monocytogenes PI-PLC in cooperation with LLO was found to be independent of phospholipid hydrolysis [68]. In addition to directly invading a cell, L. monocytogenes can also spread from one cell to another without leaving the intracellular environment. After such cell-to-cell spread the bacterium resides in a secondary vacuole surrounded by a double membrane. The escape from this double-membrane vacuole requires the coordinated action of LLO, PI-PLC and PC-PLC (a PC-preferring PLC also secreted by L. monocytogenes) [67], [69], [70]. Recent data indicate that the PI-PLC and PC-PLC act specifically in the initial degradation of the inner membrane of the double-membrane vacuole, after which the outer membrane is disrupted by LLO [71]. PLCs may likewise be involved in phagosomal escape of Bacillus anthracis. Cooperation between the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin anthrolysin O and three PLCs in B. anthracis mediated macrophage-associated growth and survival of this pathogen, while ectopic expression of anthrolysin O from B. anthracis in Bacillus subtilis conferred limited phagosomal escape upon the recombinant bacterium [72]. However, at present it is unclear whether the mediation by the combined action of anthrolysin O and the PLCs of growth and survival of B. anthracis in macrophages is actually related to an effect on phagosomal escape. Also various Rickettsia species lyse their phagosomal compartment after entry into a host cell. The lysis of the vacuolar membrane has been attributed to the activity of rickettsia PLA2\n[57], [58], [73]. The failure to identify a rickettsia PLA2 from the rickettsia genome, together with the identification of a PLD in R. prowazekii and R. conorii has led to the suggestion that a PLD is involved in the escape from the vacuole [74]. This is supported by the observation that expression of the R. prowazekii PLD gene in S. typhimurium, which normally does not escape from its vacuole, conferred on the Salmonella the ability of vacuole escape [75]. There are also viruses that use a phospholipase to escape from a host cell vesicle: parvovirus virions deploy a capsid-tethered PLA2 to breach the endosomal membrane after entry into a cell [76].",

Burkholderia cepacia secretes a lipase that increases its invasion into epithelial cells without affecting plasma membrane or tight junction integrity [77]. P. aeruginosa uses a secreted lipase together with a secreted PLC to induce inflammatory mediator release from human platelets and leukocytes. Among these inflammatory mediators are the lipidic 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and leukotriene B4\n[78], [79]. A lipase secreted by Staphylococcus aureus decreases phagocytosis and intracellular killing by human granulocytes of staphylococci, but not the phagocytic killing of pneumococci or streptococci. The effect of the lipase was reported to be partly retained after heat inactivation, indicating that the effect of the lipase is not exerted by enzyme action alone [80]. Also Candida parapsilosis secretes a lipase which inhibits phagocytosis and intracellular killing by macrophages [81]. In addition to these functions, lipases secreted by pathogens may also be involved in generation of fatty acids from host cell lipids for the pathogens\u2019 energy production or complex lipid synthesis (see Section 8).",

They are members of the GDSL lipase family, which is characterized by the presence of a conserved GDSL motif and a catalytic triad (S-D-H) [82], [83]. Cholesterol is an important component of eukaryotic membranes, but is absent from the membranes of most prokaryotes. Acylation by a pathogen of host cell cholesterol might therefore be a good tool for the pathogen to specifically target host cells using an enzyme that in principle does not discriminate between host cell and pathogen lipids. Lowering the cholesterol level in the membranes of host cells may lead to increased fluidity of these membranes. In addition, GCAT/PLAs may influence signaling pathways in the host cell by generating lysophospholipids and fatty acids, or by affecting lipid raft composition through their effects on cholesterol. Here we will describe 3 examples of host\u2013pathogen interactions involving GCAT activity that have been described in some detail.",

This protein was recently found to have GCAT activity [40], [41], PLA activity [40] and deacylase activity towards the artificial substrate para-nitrophenyl butyrate [93], but no lysophospholipase activity [40]. SseJ is translocated by a type 3 secretion system into the cytosol of a host cell from within the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) in which the Salmonella resides after its entry into the host cell [94]. The GCAT and PLA activities of SseJ are both potentiated by proteinaceous factors from the host cell [40]. SseJ destabilizes the SCV membrane in the absence of another Salmonella effector SifA [42], and antagonizes the stimulatory effect of SifA on the formation of Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs), which are tubular extensions of the SCVs [42], [95]. SifA prevents the microtubule motor kinesin from being recruited to the SCV [96]. The GCAT activity of SseJ may lower the cholesterol level of the SCV membrane and lead to storage of the resulting cholesterol esters in lipid droplets [41]. The decreased cholesterol level in the SCV membrane may lead to increased fluidity of this membrane, thus facilitating kinesin-mediated rupture of the SCV around Salmonella lacking SifA [40]. Furthermore, it was suggested that by lowering the amount of cholesterol in the SCV membrane SseJ could lower the amount of SifA on the SCV, thereby decreasing the level of Sif formation [40]. Alternatively, the formation of lysophospholipid by SseJ may aid in giving the Sif membrane the right amount of curvature.",

Replication of T. gondii in its vacuole is dependent on the conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol ester. The parasite expresses two isoforms of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which differ from mammalian ACAT in their substrate affinity and specificity, and in their mechanism of regulation [99]. The endogenous ACAT activities of T. gondii are thought to be involved in the parasite\u2019s cholesterol ester synthesis and lipid droplet biogenesis [99], [100] (Fig. 3).",

LCAT transfers an acyl chain from phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to cholesterol, similarly to the GCATs described above.

Phosphoinositides are an important class of signaling lipids and they are involved in numerous cellular signaling cascades. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated at its 3, 4 and 5 position in all possible combinations, leading to 7 different phosphoinositide species. Phosphorylation at other positions is also possible but less common. Phosphoinositides are involved in cellular signaling via two different mechanisms: (1) their hydrolysis yields second messengers that transmit downstream signals; and (2) they serve as a docking site for proteins with domains that recognize specific phosphoinositides [105]. In the latter case, phosphoinositides must be present in stoichiometric amounts and must be generated at (or targeted to) specific organelles or membrane domains. Therefore, phosphoinositides help define the identity of an organelle or of a domain by recruitment of specific proteins [106].",

It contributes to the dynamics of the entire phagocytic maturation process, starting with the formation of a phagocytic cup at the plasma membrane and ending with the maturation process transforming a phagosome into a phagolysosome. During these processes, lipid kinases and phosphatases act in concert to regulate the extensive interconversion of various phosphoinositides. In brief: at the phagocytic cup, rapid interconversions between PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 take place [109], [110]. Some of the phosphoinositides are involved in the recruitment of cytoskeletal elements, necessary for the formation of a phagocytic cup [111]. During the subsequent maturation process, formation of PI(3)P is essential, as well as the action of PI(3) kinases. Multiple waves of PI(3)P attract effector proteins such as EEA1 and Hrs to the phagosome, which is important for downstream signaling events [112]. In later stages of phagosome maturation, PI(3,5)P2 is generated through phosphorylation of PI(3)P by PIKfyve [113]. As a result, PI(3)P effector proteins are released from the membrane and PI(3,5)P2 effector proteins are recruited to the phagosomes.",

As these enzymes lead to propagation of the infection, they are often regarded as virulence factors [127]. As mentioned before, Salmonella secretes SigD which affects phosphoinositide metabolism at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The same enzyme activity of SigD is, however, also active at the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). After entry of the Salmonella, SigD is delivered from the plasma membrane to the SCV via a process controlled by SigD ubiquitination [128]. At the SCV, SigD promotes formation of PI(3)P [125]. In this process SigD does not dephosphorylate phosphoinositides to produce PI(3)P, as suggested earlier [129], but promotes recruitment of Rab5 and its effector the PI(3) kinase Vps34, which in turn results in the formation of PI(3)P [125]. The mechanism described for the effector protein SigD is reminiscent of the effector IpgD that is secreted by S. flexneri. IpgD is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 to PI(5)P. PI(4,5)P2 is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and in this way the cytoskeletal organization is affected [130], [131]. Furthermore, IpgD is required for the formation of PI(3)-kinase products during S. flexneri invasion, possibly by activating a class I PI(3)-kinase [132].",

These microdomains are important targets for pathogens and will be dealt with separately (see Section 6). During the past two decades it became clear that sphingosine and related lipids containing a sphingoid base have an important role in cellular signaling, in cell function including the cell cycle, and in apoptosis [104]. The sphingolipid metabolites ceramide (Cer) and sphingosine (Sph) are associated with growth arrest and apoptosis. Many stress stimuli increase the levels of Cer and Sph, whereas suppression of apoptosis is associated with increased intracellular levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).

The pro-survival signal of S1P delays host cell death and results in increased viral replication [144]. Cytomegalovirus also activates sphingosine kinase, but in this case an elevated level of dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P, also known as sphinganine-1-phosphate) was observed [145]. Sphingosine kinase can use both sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (dhSph) as a substrate, resulting in the synthesis of S1P or dhS1P, respectively. As dhSph is a temporary intermediate in early steps of the synthesis of sphingolipids in the ER, levels of dhSph and its metabolites such as dhS1P are usually very low. Hence little is known about their potential biological (signaling) activity. dhS1P has been shown to be an S1P receptor agonist [146]. Opposite effects of dhS1P and S1P have been observed in transforming growth factor-beta/Smad signaling [147]. Thus, potential overlap and divergence in their biological activities have yet to be defined. It is interesting to note that the lipid composition of HIV-1, an enveloped retrovirus, shows an enrichment of the unusual sphingolipid dihydrosphingomyelin [148].",

            "text": "One of the most complex forms of molecular mimicry occurs in sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingolipids play an important role in the regulation of the delicate balance between the pathogen and the host. Pathogens that cannot produce sphingolipids themselves are often capable of utilizing host sphingolipids to promote their virulence [161], [162]. This is illustrated by Chlamydia trachomatis. The bacterial membrane contains up to 4% of (modified) sphingolipids although the bacterium is not capable of sphingolipid synthesis de novo\n[163]. The observations implying that pathogens can take up and modify host cell sphingolipids will be further discussed below (see Section 8). Pathogens capable of producing sphingolipids often produce types of sphingolipid species that are not present in mammalian hosts and that are specific to plants and fungi, including phytoceramide, inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC), and products thereof [156], [161], [162]. The functions of these pathogen-specific sphingolipids are not fully understood. Some are essential for pathogen function itself, as is seen for example in Leishmania. In this case, inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis results in an accumulation of small intracellular vesicles in internal vacuoles and the flagellar pocket [164], [165]. The small vesicles in internal vacuoles resemble those occurring within the multivesicular bodies or multivesicular tubules of the endocytic pathway. These observations are consistent with the enrichment of sphingolipids in the endocytic pathway and multivesicular bodies [138]. Another potential function for these pathogen-specific sphingolipids is that they contribute to virulence. In this respect it is interesting to note that pathogen-specific sphingolipids are not a substrate for host cell enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism and thus are not converted to other sphingolipid metabolites in host cells [162]. This does not exclude the possibility, however, that several of these pathogen-specific sphingolipids can bind to host cell enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. In fact, by molecular mimicry several of these compounds are highly efficient inhibitors of host cell enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism [149]. Given the crucial role of sphingolipids in host cell function, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, these compounds can effectively affect the host organisms, and cause disease or death. In fundamental and applied research, these inhibitors are used to study the involvement of sphingolipid metabolism in biological processes. For pharmaceutical research these compounds offer great potential for the development of anti-infectious disease drugs.",

PIM stimulates Rab5 and EEA1 to enhance fusion of phagosomes with early endosomes (Fig. 4) instead of fusion with lytic organelles [136]. PIM is the precursor of lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which is a heavily glycosylated form of PI, and of ManLAM (mannose-capped form of LAM). ManLAM interferes with a PI(3) kinase that synthesizes PI(3)P and thereby with subsequent recruitment of EEA1, affecting late endosomal and lysosomal trafficking events [137], [167], [168] (Fig. 4). The molecular mechanism(s) of action of PIMs and LAMs are not known. M. tuberculosis may disrupt phosphoinositide signaling by molecular mimicry of phosphoinositides. It has been suggested that especially the structure of PIM1 and PIM2 may resemble that of phosphoinositides, with the mannose residues replacing the phosphate groups [169]. The effect of PIM is independent of PI(3)K as it stimulates early endosomal fusion in the presence of wortmannin [170]. However, it is difficult to envision the binding of PIMs to phosphoinositide-specific protein domains in which electrostatic interactions of the phosphate groups play an important role [171]. Deretic and colleagues [170] suggest that PIMs may act either by insertion in membranes and subsequent recruitment of effector proteins [172], or by modifying the biophysical properties of the membrane bilayer.",

Thus, the lipid composition of the virus resembles the composition of the host cell membrane [176], [177]. This form of mimicry may allow viruses to avoid immune detection. An example illustrating this principle is the recent observation that two rare antibodies against HIV-1 with potential clinical application were in fact reactive with the phospholipid cardiolipin [178].

It is well known as a C-terminal post-translational modification of proteins [182]. Much less is known about the function of free glycosylphosphatidylinositol molecules that abundantly cover the cell surface of several parasites, including Leishmania, Trypanosoma, T. gondii, and malaria parasites (P. falciparum). The free GPIs of these protozoan pathogens closely resemble the mammalian GPI anchor, but differ from each other with respect to the composition of the glycan head group and/or the fatty acid-moieties of the lipid anchor [183], [184]. Differences between free GPI structures are responsible for sometimes opposite biological effects. Depending on the isolation of GPIs from T. Brucei, P. falciparum, or Leishmania, the GPI isolates activated or inhibited macrophage function [185], [186], [187]. Very little is known about the mechanism of action of free GPI on host cells. If free GPI from pathogens would act by molecular mimicry on host cells, this would suggest a signaling role of GPI in mammalian cells. So far, however, the only function ascribed to GPI in mammalian cells is to serve as anchoring device for peripheral proteins. Alternatively, the signal of pathogen-derived GPI might be mediated via Toll-like receptors (TLR) and be involved in induction of secretion of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Indeed, parasite GPIs have been shown to activate TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 [188], [189], [190] A glycosylphosphatidylinositol-based treatment alleviates Trypanosomiasis-associated immunopathology [191].",

They have been classified into three distinct phylogenetic groups in which e.g.\nSalmonella and Shigella entry-associated T3SSs are closely related and the T3SSs of EPEC and Pseudomonas are more divergent [198]. At the tip of the needle, bacterial proteins insert into the host cell membrane to form a translocon that perturbs the bilayer [199], [200]. The translocon components SipB and IpaB of Salmonella and Shigella, respectively, are cholesterol-binding proteins. Cholesterol is required for the binding of SipB to the plasma membrane, and secretion of effectors by the T3SSs of Salmonella, Shigella and EPEC depends on cholesterol [201]. Of the Pseudomonas translocon components PopB and PopD, PopB directly binds cholesterol, while in addition both PopB and PopD can bind phosphatidylserine [202]. PopB together with PopD causes a cholesterol-dependent aggregation of liposomes [203]. This aggregation occurs in liposomes containing 15% cholesterol and is independent of the presence of sphingomyelin, suggesting that this effect is lipid raft-independent. The biological significance of the aggregation observed in this assay is not clear. Under different experimental conditions, PopB and PopD synergistically permeabilize vesicles without causing aggregation in a cholesterol-independent manner [202].",

Cholesterol levels may affect intracellular trafficking in various ways, including the recruitment of proteins and lipids to the pathogen-containing vacuole. For example, cholesterol was found to mediate the phagosomal association of TACO/coronin-1, affecting the degradation of mycobacteria in lysosomes [174] (Fig. 4). Coronin-1 is required for activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria [214]. This mechanism acts in concert with the effect of mycobacterium on sphingosine kinase (discussed in Section 3.4 and elsewhere [215]).",

Recently, VacA was identified as a bacterial virulence factor, secreted by the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori that exploits a plasma membrane sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as a cellular receptor [298]. Helicobacter pylori may exploit the capacity of SM to partition into lipid rafts in order to access the raft-associated cellular machinery. Other pathogens that exploit lipid-binding toxins to localise to lipid rafts include toxigenic E. coli, which secrete the heat-labile enterotoxin LTI targeting GM1, or which secrete the heat-labile enterotoxin LTII targeting GD1, Shigella dysenteriae that secrete Shiga toxin targeting Gb3, and Vibrio cholera that secrete cholera toxin targeting GM1. The multimeric toxins have the potential to cluster rafts, thus allowing high affinity toxin-binding through relatively weak individual binding forces of carbohydrate binding sites [387], [388]. In addition, the raft-dependent interaction also determines their mechanism of uptake. It is becoming increasingly clear that there are clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways which differ in their requirement of lipid rafts [389], [390], [391], [392].",

Ceramide molecules have the tendency to induce the formation of ceramide-enriched microdomains, to function as a fusogen that triggers the spontaneous fusion of ceramide-enriched membrane microdomains, and to stabilize large ceramide-enriched membrane macrodomains [394], [395], [396]. The second possibility of lipid targeting by pathogens is that lipids cause a reorganization/alteration of lipid rafts. This possibility has been suggested for lipoarabinomannan (LAM), an integral component of the M. tuberculosis that markedly alters the morphology of lipid domains in membranes [397]. As a result phagosome maturation is inhibited [398]. The third possibility is that pathogens target lipids to cause a disruption of lipid raft structures. Brucella abortus secretes 1,2 cyclic glycan, a component that resembles cyclodextrins and extracts cholesterol from membranes, resulting in disruption of lipid rafts [399].",

In model membranes that consist of only a specific subset of lipids, lipid rafts can easily be observed (see e.g.\n[400]). In biological membranes, the lipid composition is much more complex and heterogeneous, resulting in the suggestion that protein interactions are necessary to stabilize lipid rafts (see e.g.\n[229] for a discussion on this topic). The fact that pathogens can alter the oligomeric state of rafts in biological membranes by targeting lipids suggests that lipids provide a major driving force determining the biophysical state and hence physiological role of rafts.",

Other viruses known to assemble on or bud from lipid rafts in host cell membranes include influenza virus [176], measles virus [401] and Newcastle disease virus [352] (see Table 1 for a comprehensive list). As HIV-1 particles excluded a bona fide raft marker (flotillin-1), this indicates that the virus buds from a subset of cellular microdomains. The function of lipid rafts in virus assembly can be manifold, including recruitment of a subset of host lipids and proteins into viral membranes and determination of the oligomeric state of viral proteins. Another surprising possibility was suggested by the finding that assembly of the non-enveloped Rotavirus is dependent on cholesterol, suggesting that rafts may control the proper incorporation of viral proteins into virions [402].",

Other examples include the induction of lipid droplet formation by Plasmodium berghei in mouse kidney and liver cells [412], [413] and the induction of lipid droplet formation by Candida albicans in macrophages and hepatocytes by use of an extracellular lipase [414].

In addition, structural proteins of HCV have been found to localise to lipid droplets [415]. The HCV capsid protein (core protein) localises to the LDs and recruits non-structural proteins and replication complexes, which appears critical for the production of virus particles [416], [417]. The core protein most likely replaces adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), a major protein associated with the surface of lipid droplets, by progressively coating the entire surface. The absence of ADRP then results in lipid droplet aggregation around the nucleus [418]. The presence of the replication machinery and the observation of virions in close proximity to the LDs might indicate virus assembly at or in close proximity to lipid droplets. Recent work from Roingeard et al. [419] indicates that the overexpression of HCV core protein induces virion budding from ER membranes in close proximity to the LD rather than at membranes directly apposed to the lipid droplets.",

Thus, a close interaction of lipid droplets with the pathogen vacuole allows a possible discharge of lipid droplet content [421].

            "text": "One function of acquired lipids is to modulate host\u2013pathogen interactions and virulence, as has been discussed in other sections of this review (see also e.g.\n[433]). A second function of acquired lipids is to serve as an energy source. For example, Corynebacterium jeikeium cannot synthesize fatty acids, but upon their acquisition they are utilized for subsequent \u03b2-oxidation, as the bacterium contains all the enzymes required for this process [431]. Even cholesterol can be used as a substrate for energy production, for example by Rhodococcus species, soil bacteria related to M. tuberculosis\n[434]. To ensure expedited energy supply, Gram-negative bacteria can induce the release of fatty acids from host cells by stimulating adipose lipolysis via the lipid A moiety of LPS [435]. A third function of acquired lipids is to provide building blocks for pathogen assembly. In general, pathogens can synthesize the typical prokaryotic lipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol and must acquire lipids generally associated with eukaryotes such as sphingomyelin, cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol [163]. Hence, several pathogens are auxotrophic for these lipids (e.g. sphingolipids [162] or cholesterol [99], [219]). Host cell lipids can also be used as a carbon source, as has been described for e.g.\nM. tuberculosis\n[205], [429], Salmonella\n[436], Candida albicans\n[437], and Cryptococcus neoformans\n[438]. The acquisition of a viral envelope from host cell membranes could also be considered as an effective mechanism to acquire building blocks for pathogen assembly. This has been discussed elsewhere in this review (Section 4).",

Indeed, several host cell-derived lipids accumulate in the membrane of pathogen vacuoles. Cholesterol accumulates in the vacuoles of e.g.\nCoxiella\n[446], Salmonella\n[204], Chlamydia\n[447], T. gondii\n[448], [449], [450], and M. tuberculosis\n[212].

T. gondii also preferentially recruits PC over other phospholipids to its parasitophorous vacuole [453]. How are these lipids delivered to the vacuole? In the case of Chlamydia, the observation that host transmembrane proteins are not delivered to the vacuole has intriguing implications for the mechanisms of transport [454]. Only for a few pathogens, including Chlamydia and T. gondii, the molecular mechanisms of lipid transport to the pathogen vacuole have been described in some detail.

The transport of both sphingomyelin [451] and cholesterol [447] was shown to be Brefeldin A-sensitive, suggesting a Golgi origin of these vesicles. In contrast, Golgi-derived glycoproteins en route to the plasma membrane were not intercepted by the pathogen [456]. These results indicate that only a subfraction of vesicles is targeted for delivery to the pathogen vacuole. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that Chlamydia preferentially intercepts basolaterally-directed sphingomyelin-containing exocytic vesicles [457]. Whether the intercepted vesicles represent bona fide exocytic vesicles derived from the Golgi complex remain to be established, as it cannot be excluded that Chlamydia induces an alternative or modified exocytic pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Recently, it was shown that Chlamydia\ntrachomatis causes fragmentation of the Golgi complex and the generation of Golgi ministacks surrounding the bacterial inclusion [458]. This process is mediated by bacteria-induced proteolytic cleavage of the Golgi matrix protein Golgin-84. This Golgi fragmentation is involved in lipid acquisition, as inhibition of the cleavage of Golgin-84 also inhibited the transport of lipids to the pathogen vacuole. These observations open the possibility that lipid transport is not only mediated by exocytic vesicles, but also by Golgi fragments (Fig. 5). T. gondii also induces Golgi fragmentation in the host cell, but in this case, the Golgi fragments seem dispensable for parasite invasion and replication [459]. It will interesting to determine whether the lipids from these Golgi fragments are transported by fusion of the Golgi fragments with the vacuole or by the generation of contact sites between the Golgi fragments and the bacterial vacuole (see also next Section 8.5). The Golgi fragments generated by knockdown of Golgin-84 are different from the Golgi fragments caused by Brefeldin A. First, in the presence of Brefeldin A, de novo synthesized sphingomyelin and cholesterol from the exocytic pathway are no longer delivered to the Chlamydia vacuole [447], [451]. Second, whereas Golgin-84-induced Golgi fragmentation enhances bacterial replication [458], Brefeldin A does not affect bacterial multiplication [447], [460]. The ineffectiveness of Brefeldin A on bacterial multiplication indicates that alternative pathways must be available to provide Chlamydia with lipids. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that Chlamydia can also recruit lipids from multivesicular bodies that are rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin [461], [462] (Fig. 5).",

In contrast to Chlamydia, however, Salmonella replication is affected by Brefeldin A [464]. Legionella pneumophilla also intercepts vesicular traffic, in this case from the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, and the pathogen-containing vacuole becomes surrounded by these vesicles [465]. These vesicles attach and fuse with the Legionella-containing vacuole, allowing the acquisition of ER-derived proteins. Similar to Legionella, Brucella abortus interacts with the ER exit sites and its replication is inhibited by blockage of Sar1 activity, which disrupts the ER exit sites [466]. In the cases of Salmonella, Legionella and Brucella, it remains to be established whether, as a result of these specific interceptions of exocytic vesicles, the pathogens acquire lipids.",

The intracellular parasite T. gondii acquires cholesterol from the host. T. gondii scavenges cholesterol from LDL that is taken up by the host cell (Fig. 3) and does not utilize cholesterol synthesized de novo by the host cell. During Toxoplasma infection, cholesterol from LDL travels from the endosome to the parasitophorous vacuole and is taken up by the parasite in a microtubule dependent way [448], [449]. The characteristics of cholesterol acquisition, such as temperature, energy, and microtubule dependency, supported a mechanism involving vesicular transport [449]. Recent evidence, however, allowed Coppens et al.\n[471] to propose an unconventional model that involves the inward budding of endosomal/lysosomal vesicles into the parasitophorous vacuole and subsequent fission of the vacuolar membrane, generating double membrane-layered vesicles in the vacuole.",

Lipid droplets were found docked at the surface of the vacuole and can translocate from the host cell cytoplasm into the vacuolar lumen [425]. How entire organelles such as lipid droplets or vesicles derived from multivesicular bodies are translocated across the vacuolar membrane remains to be determined. Under physiological conditions, inward budding (i.e. into the lumen of an organelle) is so far only observed for multivesicular bodies. The ESCRT machinery provides the driving force for this process [472]. Pathogens such as HIV hijack this machinery to bud from the plasma membrane. It remains to be established whether the inward budding into the parasitophorous vacuole also requires elements of the ESCRT machinery, or whether specific virulence effectors, secreted by the pathogens, are sufficient for this process. Clearly, the uptake of lipid droplets and vesicles from multivesicular bodies is dependent on pathogen-secreted factors [425], [471]).",

Pathogens make extensive use of the complexity of the host cell lipidome and have evolved very sophisticated mechanisms to use the diversity and complexity of the lipidome of their host to their advance. This is best illustrated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that uses a large portion of its coding capacity to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis [473]. Pathogens not only use lipids as building blocks or as a nutrient source, but also to influence the host cell physiology, enabling their survival and replication.",

Lipidomic analysis of host\u2013pathogen interactions by mass spectrometry will provide a great opportunity for future research and can be expected to reveal the specific roles of individual lipid species. This will greatly aid in the generation of more specific drugs against pathogens. An example of drug development that interferes with lipid metabolism is the statins. Statins have been reported to inhibit the replication of various pathogens in host cells, including viruses [29], [474], [475], [476], [477], [478], [479], [480], [481], [482], [483], bacteria [484], [485], [486], [487], [488], [489] and parasites [490], [491], [492], [493]. Clinical studies have been carried out concerning the use of statins for the management of septic patients [494]. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and reduce the biosynthesis of cholesterol, but also that of farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. The latter two compounds serve as lipid attachments for a post-translational modification, termed prenylation, of a great number of regulatory proteins in eukaryotes, among which small GTP-binding proteins. These GTP-binding proteins have crucial roles in intracellular inflammatory signaling [495]. The inhibition by statins of the prenylation of regulatory proteins in the eukaryotic cells is in most cases thought to cause the suppressing effect of statins on the replication of the microorganisms. In the case of the suppression of Salmonella replication in host cells by statins [485], the inhibition of host cell prenylation of the bacterial effector protein SifA [496] may also play a role.",

Many novel and unanticipated findings are expected to emerge from these studies, in combination with novel methods of lipidomic analysis.

In this respect it is revealing that most pathogens studied so far do not play a single trick with the host cell but simultaneously induce several changes in the host cell signaling and trafficking mechanisms, both at the level of the proteome and of the lipidome. In this review, we have described several pathogens, such as T. gondii (Fig. 3), Mycobacteria (Fig. 4), Salmonella and Chlamydia (Fig. 5), which appeared in multiple sections, illustrating that they take full advantage of the complexity of the host cell lipidome.",

Thus lipidomic techniques will soon provide us with a detailed view on changes of the host cell lipidome in response to pathogen infection. Although lipidomic methods are technically more challenging than proteomic techniques, they may soon catch up and bypass proteomic analyses. Most lipids exist across species, allowing the application of lipidomic analyses to all species, independently of the knowledge of the genomic organization. In the field of host\u2013pathogen interactions, with many pathogen genomes still unknown, this is a great advantage.
