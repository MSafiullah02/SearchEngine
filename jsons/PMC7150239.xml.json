            "text": "\nThe members of the order Nidovirales are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses of widely different architecture. Depending on whether the external appearance of the virion or the nucleocapsid is considered, similarities and differences can be discerned (Figure 1\n).\nCoronavirinae\n: As seen in conventional electron micrographs, coronaviruses are roughly spherical enveloped particles, 120\u2013160 nm in diameter, with a characteristic fringe of 15\u201320 nm petal-shaped surface projections (peplomers). In a subset of betacoronaviruses a second, inner fringe of 5\u20137 nm surface projections is also seen. Coronavirus (CoV) particles as studied by cryo-electron tomography are homogeneous in size and distinctively spherical (envelope outer diameter 85\u00b15 nm). The envelope exhibits an unusual thickness (7.8\u00b10.7 nm), almost twice that of a typical biological membrane. The nucleocapsid is helical and tightly folded to form a compact structure that tends to closely follow the envelope.\n\nTorovirinae, Torovirus\n: Toroviruses appear as a mixture of rod-shaped, kidney-shaped and spherical particles. This is, however, most likely an EM artifact. Native torovirus particles are presumably bacilliform with rounded ends, measuring 100\u2013140 nm in length and 35\u201342 nm in width (envelope outer dimensions). Virions carry two types of surface projections that in size and shape closely resemble those of (beta)coronaviruses. The most distinctive virion element, the core, is a flexible and seemingly hollow tube of helical symmetry (periodicity ca. 4.5 nm), about 100 nm in length and about 23 nm across with a central channel of about 10 nm in diameter.\nTorovirinae, Bafinivirus\n: Bafiniviruses (bacilliform fish nidoviruses) are 130\u2013160\u00d737\u201345 nm in dimension (excluding spikes) with a rod-like nucleocapsid in the form of a rigid cylinder (120\u2013150\u00d719\u201322 nm with a central channel of 2\u20135 nm). The virion envelope is studded with 20\u201325 nm coronavirus-like peplomers.\nRoniviridae\n: Roniviruses (rod-shaped nidoviruses) are also bacilliform in shape, 150\u2013200 nm in length and about 45 nm in diameter, and contain a tightly coiled nucleocapsid with a diam\u00adeter of about 25 nm and a 5\u20137 nm helical periodicity. The ronivirus envelope bears spikes, but smaller in size than those of coronaviruses, projecting approximately 11 nm from the surface.\nArteriviridae\n: Arterivirus virions are significantly smaller than those of the other nidoviruses, spherical or egg-shaped and with a seemingly isometric core that contains the genome. Complete particles and nucleocapsids, as measured by cryo-EM, average 54 nm and 39 nm in diameter, respectively, with core and envelope separated by a 2\u20133 nm gap. Three-dimensional reconstructions, based on cryo-EM tomography, suggests that the core might consist of a helical nucleocapsid wrapped into a hollow ball. No spikes are obvious on the arterivirus surface, but a surface pattern of relatively small and indistinct projections has been observed.\n",

Though different in sequence, the M proteins of corona-, toro- and bafiniviruses are alike in size, structure and presumably also in function. They have a similar triple-spanning membrane topology with a short amino terminus located on the outside of the virion, and a long C-terminal endodomain, comprising an amphiphilic region and a hydrophilic tail. The amphiphilic segment is believed to associate with the inner leaflet of the membrane to form a matrix-like lattice, which would explain the remarkable thickness of the coronavirus envelope as observed by cryo-electron tomography. Of note, in transmissible gasteroenteritis virus of swine (Alphacoronavirus 1), a second population of M proteins adopting an Nexo-Cexo topology in the viral envelope has been described.\n",

Remote but significant sequence similarity among S proteins of toro-, bafini- and (to lesser extent) coronaviruses suggests common ancestry and similarity in structure and function, i.e. receptor-binding and membrane fusion. With few exceptions, the S proteins become proteolytically cleaved during virion biogenesis into subunits S1 and S2 that remain associated. Coronavirus S proteins assemble into homotrimers and this most likely also occurs with the S proteins of toro- and bafiniviruses. The bulbous membrane-distal part of the peplomers, comprising the receptor-binding domains, are largely composed of S1 subunits, whereas the C-terminal S2 subunits form a membrane-anchored stalk. Heptad repeat regions in S2 are assumed to drive membrane fusion during entry by undergoing a series of conformational changes culminating in a six-helical bundle. In the primary structure, the N-terminal repeat, HR1, is located immediately downstream of a predicted internal fusion peptide and the other repeat, HR2, immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain.",

Corona- and torovirus HEs share 30% sequence identity and thus are far more closely related to each other than are the S and M proteins of these nidovirus lineages. While the latter two protein species might have been encoded in the last common ancestor of the Corona- and Torovirinae lineages, the HE proteins must have been acquired relative recently. Originating from a hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein resembling that of influenza C virus, the HEs appear to have been introduced into the betacorona- and torovirus proteomes independently (i.e. through two separate horizontal gene transfer events) well after the Corona\u2013Torovirinae split, and in the case of the coronaviruses even after their separation into alpha-, beta- and gammacoronaviruses.",

It forms a disulfide-linked heterodimer with the major glycoprotein (GP5 for EAV, PRRSV and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, LDV; GP7 in simian hemorrhagic fever virus, SHFV), which is also a putative triple-spanning membrane protein. Viral glycoproteins GP2, GP3 and GP4 are minor virion components and form heterotrimers. The remaining envelope protein, E (for envelope), is small, hydrophobic and non-glycosylated, and believed to function as an ion-channel protein.

The virion RNA functions as mRNA (mRNA1) for ORFs 1a and 1b, but the expression of the latter requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift. Translation of ORF1a yields polyprotein pp1a. In 20\u201330% of the cases, ribo\u00adsomes do not reach the ORF1a termination codon, but slip at the ORF1a/1b overlap and shift register to the 21 reading frame to continue translation into ORF1b.

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the conservation of functional domains in the replicase polyproteins is the result of a continuous evolution from a common nidovirus ancestor. Activities and functions have been identified for many of the conserved replicase domains and the corresponding cleavage products. Replicase subunits conserved across all nidoviruses include (from N- to C-terminus): (i) a chymotrypsin-like protease (3C-like or main protease; 3CLpro, Mpro) that is flanked by two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (tm-Mpro-tm) in the viral polyprotein and has a substrate specificity resembling that of picornavirus 3C proteases, (ii) a large RdRp, (iii) a 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 helicase domain containing a putative multinuclear Zn-finger-like domain at its N-terminus (Zn-HEL). Some replicase subunits are present only in a subset of nidoviruses. A nidoviral endoribonuclease specific for uridylate (NendoU) was long considered to be shared by all nidoviruses and to represent a unique diagnostic molecular marker that would distinguish the members of this order from all other RNA viruses known to date. However, a very recent study shows roniviruses to lack this domain. A 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and ribose-2\u2019-O-methyltransferase (O-MT) are conserved in the large nidoviruses, but not in arteriviruses. An ADP-ribose-1\u201d-phosphatase (ADRP, also called macrodomain) and a noncanonical \u201csecondary\u201d RdRp with possible primase activity (coronavirus nsp8), have been (tentatively) mapped only in members of the family Coronaviridae. A guanine N7 methyltransferase, recently identified in coronaviruses, appears to be conserved in roniviruses. The conservation of key proteolytic and RNA-processing enzymes in the main nidovirus lineages is summarized in Figure 3.",

The sg mRNAs of corona-, arteri- and bafiniviruses are chimeric, that is, comprised of sequences that are non-contiguous in the viral genome. Each carries a short 5\u2032 leader sequence of 55\u201392, 170\u2013210 nt, and 42 nucleotides, respectively, which is identical to the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome. It was established early on that leader and \u201cbody\u201d sequences are not joined through splicing, but via a process of discontinuous RNA synthesis. A key observation was the presence of mirror-copy nested sets of sg minus-strand RNAs in corona- and arterivirus-infected cells. Combined experimental evidence from biochemical and reverse genetics analyses indicates that these sg minus-strand RNAs are in fact the templates for sg mRNA synthesis. Replicative intermediates (RI)/replicative forms with sizes corresponding to the different sg mRNAs were shown to be actively involved in transcription. According to the prevailing 3\u2032-discontinuous extension model, the discontinuous step occurs during the production of sg minus-strand RNAs and entails attenuation of RNA synthesis at the TRSs, followed by a similarity-assisted copy choice RNA recombination event. In corona-, arteri- and bafiniviruses, a TRS is present immediately downstream of the genomic leader sequence. It is believed that, during minus-strand RNA synthesis, the replicase complex upon encounter of an internal TRS dissociates from the template and is transferred to the 5\u2032 end of the genome, guided by sequence complementarity between the anti-TRS on the nascent strand and the genomic TRS. Reinitiation and completion of RNA synthesis would then result in a chimeric minus-strand that in turn would serve as a template for uninterrupted (continuous) synthesis of 5\u2032 leader-containing sg mRNAs.",

It is likely that sg mRNAs are transcribed from sg minus-strand templates also in toro- and in roniviruses. Here, the conserved sequence elements (TPs) preceding the 3\u2032-proximal genes might serve dual roles as signals for premature termination of minus-strand synthesis and as promoters for plus-strand production. The torovirus S gene, expressed from mRNA 2, lacks a TP. Apparently, transcription-competent minus-strand sg RNAs are produced by inclusion of a complementary copy of the 5\u2032-terminal genomic TP via a similarity-assisted RNA recombination process analogous to that seen in corona- and arteriviruses.",
