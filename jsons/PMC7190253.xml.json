As part of the program, a clinical decision support tool was developed to guide clinicians to consider possible sources of infection, evaluate noninfectious sources of fever, and carefully review risk factors of patients for bloodstream infections. The implementation of the program resulted in a reduction in the total number of BCs collected by 46%.7 Two additional hospitals then decided to adopt the program. The research team performed a WSA by interviewing different stakeholders (eg, physicians and nurses) during a 2-day trip to each hospital.6 Informed by findings of the WSA, the 2 hospitals adapted the program to their context and achieved a 21%\u221237% reduction in BC use.8",

The Bright STAR collaborative includes 15 hospitals across 14 states whose PICUs vary in size and patient volume. Each participating hospital convened a local QI team, led by 2 physician champions, and involving many other stakeholders. The research team routinely communicated with the local QI teams through various avenues, including an initial individual site call, monthly individual site calls, monthly all-site calls, and individual and group emails. Because of the number and geographic span of the participating hospitals, the research team could not visit each hospital and conduct in-person interviews. With limited capabilities and resources, the local QI teams could also not easily conduct their own WSA. Therefore, the research team adapted the onsite, interview-based WSA to a survey-based WSA. In this article, we examine the feasibility of using the survey-based WSA for large-scale dissemination.",
