A rapid positive result enables a quick diagnosis, targeted treatment options, reduction or elimination of inappropriate antibiotic therapies, opportunity for cohorting seriously ill patients for infection control purposes, and the potential for reduced laboratory test usage and hospitalization costs. Factors involved in the selection of a rapid diagnostic assay include statistical performance characteristics of the assay such as sensitivity, specificity, simple use and interpretation, background clarity, and cost per test result. The statistical performance characteristics of a rapid assay are influenced by the patient population being tested, the prevalence of disease in the community, and the type of specimen submitted for analysis.",

One cause of false-negative results by IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest may be attributable to the small amount of viral particles in the sample. In thirty-four samples, we detected adenovirus by IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest, which were subsequently multiplex PCR negative (false positives). These discrepancies may be explained at least in part by cross-reaction with other viruses (eleven cases the sample was positive for bocavirus, five influenza B-virus, four influenza A-virus, four enterovirus, three RSV-A, two rhinovirus, two metapneumovirus, one influenza C-virus and one parainfluenzavirus type 3). Thus, the IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest has moderately sensitivity and specificity compared with those of multiplex PCR and viral culture for detecting the Adenovirus. Samples with negative rapid assay results should have additional testing for adenovirus performed by either viral culture or PCR. The IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest was also easy to perform, and provided results in 15 min, a time frame that is useful to decide optimal treatment strategies, when the test is positive.",
