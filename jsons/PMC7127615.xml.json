Nevertheless, the CSF analysis showed 4 patients with pleocytosis, and none with albumin-cytologic dissociation (an increase in CSF protein levels without a corresponding increase in cellular content characteristic of GBS). Previous reports on ZIKAV-GBS showed similar time between onset of viral symptoms and neurological deterioration (6 days).

Indeed, large investigator-led research consortia have proven to be important in the initial characterization of novel infectious threats such as H1N1 influenza, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and ZIKAV. The availability of validated and ready-to-use case report forms through the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) facilitated the rapid launch of data collection.",

The scarcity of resources and technological limitations in certain countries, especially during an epidemic, play a major role in determining diagnostic protocols. In addition, the workup for GBS was insufficient, undermining the certainty of diagnosis in some cases. Some data had to be collected retrospectively and even then, key elements may be missing due to the complexity of this nascent international collaboration. Participation in the study was voluntary and unfunded. As such, we do not claim to establish the regional burden of severe ZIKAV infection during the period reported. Furthermore, we lack reliable prevalence data, so we cannot estimate the risk of severe illness amongst infected patients.",

In this study we report 10 adults critically ill patients with diagnosis of ZIKAV confirmed that required admission to ICU due to life-threatening complications. In our series, ZIKAV was associated with a spectrum of neurological presentations: most commonly a GBS-like syndrome, but also encephalitis, suggesting more than one potential pathophysiological mechanism. This is important in clinical follow-up of patients suspected with ZIKAV, and when considering etiologies amongst patients presenting with neurologic symptoms. Larger population-based observational studies of patients with ZIKAV are needed to help identify risk factors for severe illness so that we may better counsel patients and prepare the health care system.",
