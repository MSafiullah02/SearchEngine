The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue; while headache, hemoptysis, and gastrointestinal symptoms are less common [1] . Recently, there was a report of a COVID-19 patient from Wuhan, China, who developed rhabdomyolysis during hospitalization [2] . Herein, we report the first case of an elderly male who presented with rhabdomyolysis and later was diagnosed with COVID-19.",

His home health attendance found him sat on the toilet and could not stand up due to the pain and weakness of both thighs. He had a past medical history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, benign prostatic hypertrophy, bilateral knees osteoarthritis, and mild cognitive impairment. His medications include simvastatin, donepezil, furosemide, losartan, metoprolol succinate, and tamsulosin, which were not changed since the past year. He took simvastatin for several years without any complications. He denied fever but admitted having some dry cough. He denied any other respiratory or gastrointestinal tract symptoms. On initial evaluation, he had a low-grade fever with a temperature of 100.2 Fahrenheit, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22. Oxygen saturation was 94 percent on room air. His lungs exam revealed mild crackles in both basal lungs fields. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed blunting of the left costophrenic angle, indicating a small pleural effusion, which did not change compared to the CXR from the previous month ( Figure 1 ). His pelvis X-ray was normal.",

His urine analysis showed a presence of blood on a urine dipstick test with absent red blood cells. The COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test from the nasopharyngeal swab was sent due to the presence of fever and cough and returned positive. The flu test was negative. He received a total of 2 L bolus of intravenous crystalloids but led to a mild exacerbation of his congestive heart failure, which was resolved after giving intravenous furosemide. Hydroxychloroquine was given for five days. His symptoms were improved. He reported less pain and fatigue, and his CPK was gradually decreased, as demonstrated in Figure  2 . However, he developed acute kidney injury on hospital day 7 with a creatinine of 1.38 mg/dl. Small boluses of intravenous crystalloids (total of 1 L) were administered and his creatinine decreased to 1.09 mg/dl on the next day. ",
