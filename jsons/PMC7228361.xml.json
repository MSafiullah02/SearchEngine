Liver biopsies in SARS patients showed a significant increase in mitotic cells, with eosinophilic bodies and balloon\u2010like hepatocytes, suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV may induce apoptosis of liver cells and thus cause liver injury.\n18\n Other studies showed that SARS\u2010CoV\u2010specific protein 7a can induce apoptosis in cell lines of different organs (including the lung, kidney and liver) through the caspase\u2010dependent pathway, further confirming the possibility that SARS\u2010CoV directly attacks liver tissue and causes liver injury.\n24\n\n",

Currently, studies on the mechanisms of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010related liver injury are limited. It has been shown that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 also uses ACE2 as its entry receptor as SARS\u2010Cov does.\n52\n Chai et al\n53\n found that both liver cells and bile duct cells express ACE2. However, the ACE2 expression of bile duct cells is much higher than that of liver cells, but to a comparable level of alveolar type 2 cells in the lung. Bile duct epithelial cells are known to play important roles in liver regeneration and immune response.\n54\n These results suggested that the liver injury occurred in COVID\u201019 patients may be due to the damage to bile duct cells, but not liver cells by the virus infection. Besides, the inflammatory cytokine storm was observed in severe COVID\u201019 cases,\n55\n yet whether it results in liver damage in patients remains to be investigated. Postmortem biopsies were recently performed in a death COVID\u201019 patient, and the results showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection or drug\u2010induced liver injury.\n56\n Similar to the situation in SARS, antibiotics, antivirals and steroids are widely used for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n57\n These drugs are all potential causes of liver injury during COVID\u201019, but not yet being evident.\n49\n Actually, a recent study reported that the liver injury observed in COVID\u201019 patients might be caused by lopinavir/litonavir, which is used as antivirals for the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n43\n So far, there is a lack of reports that liver failure occurs in COVID\u201019 patients with chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B or C.",

The mechanisms of liver injury that occurred during SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection remain largely unclear. Our current understanding suggests that infection of highly pathogenic human coronavirus may result in liver injury by direct virus\u2010induced cytopathic effects and/or immunopathology induced by overshooting inflammatory responses. Meanwhile, SARS\u2010CoV may aggravate liver injury in patients with viral hepatitis, but there is no evidence for MERS\u2010CoV and SARs\u2010CoV\u20102. Importantly, drug\u2010induced liver injury during the treatment of coronavirus infection should not be ignored and needs to be carefully investigated. From a clinical perspective, in addition to actively dealing with the primary disease caused by coronavirus infection, attention should also be paid to monitor the occurrence of liver injury, and to the application of drugs which may induce liver damage, such as antibiotics of macrolides or quinolone, and steroids, etc. Patients with liver damage are advised to be treated with drugs that could both protect liver functions and inhibit inflammatory responses, such as ammonium glycyrrhizinate,\n58\n which may, in turn, accelerate the process of disease recovery.",
