When several outcomes were available from one study, we chose \u201cdays of sputum production\u201d as the main outcome, because this symptom is most characteristic of the disease (4). For studies that did not include the outcome \u201cdays of sputum production,\u201d we chose the outcome in the study that was the most clinically similar (sputum production score, cough amount score). We transformed each outcome into units of standard deviation, thus giving a comparable effect size for different outcomes. The study-specific effect size was the difference in the mean outcome for the antibiotic and placebo groups, divided by the pooled standard deviation of the outcome measure in that study. The summary effect size across studies was calculated as a weighted average of the study-specific effect sizes, with weights equal to the inverse of the estimated variance. The significance of the summary effect size, standardized by its estimated variance, was assessed by comparing it with the standard normal distribution. A test for heterogeneity was calculated by comparing the weighted average of the squared differences between summary and study-specific effect sizes with an appropriate X\n2 distribution, with the same weights being used. These calculations used standard formulas (44), which assume that the outcomes are normally distributed and the sample sizes are approximately equal in the antibiotic and placebo groups.",

We found a small, statistically significant benefit to the use of antibiotics in patients with acute bronchitis approximately equal to one-fifth of a standard deviation unit. To relate the observed benefit in the summary effect size to clinical variables, we also calculated summary mean differences for all outcomes that were reported by at least four trials (duration of sputum production, duration of cough, and days lost from work), all of which showed small, nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics.

Both of these trials showed no benefit from the use of antibiotics. Thus, their exclusion tended to bias our results in favor of antibiotics. In addition, the summary effect size may have been overestimated if publication bias made it more likely that studies showing benefit were published, whereas those showing no benefit were not. If there was publication bias, small studies with negative findings should have been unlikely to be published, whereas small studies with positive findings should have been more likely to be published, leading to a correlation between study size and effect size. We found no such correlation.",

Patients who were treated with antibiotics had a modest improvement in peak expiratory flow of approximately 11 L/min compared with those treated with placebo.

They include prescription costs, medication side effects, and an increase in antibiotic resistance. Several studies have shown that widespread antibiotic use leads to the development of resistant organisms 45, 46, 47. Antibiotic use for acute bronchitis constitutes a substantial portion of all antibiotic use in the United States, accounting for 9% of all prescriptions written for children (26). Furthermore, side effects of antibiotics used for acute bronchitis are common, occurring in 10% to 36% of patients 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37. The practice of routinely giving antibiotics for acute bronchitis encourages patients to expect antibiotics for subsequent episodes (48), which adds to the cycle of medication costs, side effects, and antibiotic resistance. We believe that there should be a clear, substantial benefit to antibiotics to justify these costs.",

In a study of 140 patients randomly assigned to treatment with doxycycline or placebo, Verheij et al (35) reported that doxycycline resulted in clinical benefit among patients older than 55 years and in those who felt ill at study entry. However, approximately 30% of the patients in that study had abnormalities on lung auscultation and therefore may have had conditions such as pneumonia that would show a large benefit from antibiotic treatment (49). Others have suggested treating patients who test positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae\n(39), although there is no evidence from randomized trials to support this practice. In a randomized trial using erythromycin to treat acute bronchitis, King et al (37) found no difference in outcomes between patients who tested positive and those who tested negative for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. More research is needed to determine if there are subgroups of patients who are likely to have a substantial benefit from treatment with antibiotics.",
