Most investigations have examined interactions between pairs of potentially competing, often congeneric, species (Hart, 1983) . However, there is no compelling reason to limit the possibility of resource partitioning to just two or three species utilizing a single resource along one niche dimension. Spatial and temporal patterns of species coexistence may depend upon a tendency for each species to specialize in resource use, thereby reducing or eliminating the negative affects of interspecific competition (MacArthur & Levins, 1967; May & MacArthur, 1972) .

Vannote & Sweeney (1980) hypothesized that as a result of interspecific competition, periods of peak resource utilization by species within a given stream functional group will follow a seasonal sequence. This hypothesis is one of the tenets of the River Continuum Concept (Vannote et al., 1980) and is consistent with the view that community development is a process of assembling numerous species into discrete functional groups, thus leading to efficient annual use of stream resources through temporal specialization (Vannote & Sweeney, 1980) . This temporal pattern has been observed within guilds of filter-feeding, shredding and grazing caddisflies and shredding stoneflies (Cather & Gaufin, 1976; Oswood, 1976; Vannote & Sweeney, 1980) . Only two studies, however, have compared this pattem against appropriate null models. Georgian & Wallace (1983) found that within a scraper guild, the peak periods of resource utilization were more regularly spaced thati would be expected by chance alone. In contrast, Tokeshi (1986) found that the mean overlap in temporal resource utilization for nine species of epiphytic chironomid larvae was significantly larger than expected from a null model analysis.",

Sample units from both sites (six to eight replicates) were used to determine species population densities. Using samples from both sites to determine population densities was justified given the physico-chemical similarities between sites. Also, a community similarity index (Whittaker, 1975) , an expression of the degree to which two sites are alike based on the relative abundances of species, indicated a 76% similarity between sites for the total macroinvertebrate fauna and a 93% similarity for members of the guild.

Calculations were made separately for different generations of the bivoltine species Baetis tricaudatus. Separate calculations were also made for different cohorts of poorly synchronized, univoltine species. In both cases the production over a given time interval for different cohorts or generations representing a single species was summed to provide a single resource utilization curve. The temporal pattern of peak production for the species of this guild was analysed using a null model developed for flowering phenological data (Poole & Rathke, 1979) . This analysis is equivalent to randomly assigning each of the species a peak production date and then comparing this random pattern to the observed pattern. Because production was essentially zero for 4 months of the year (November-February), none of the randomly assigned peak production values were allowed to fall within this time period. Therefore, this model incorporated the effects of winter and ensured that all peak production estimates occurred randomly but outside the four winter months. The resource utilization curves for B. tricaudatus, D. grandis and D. doddsi were bimodal; peak production occurred in the spring and in autumn. Both peaks were used for these three species.",

If we had found a regular pattern among the species resource utilization curves then competition would be one of the likely mechanisms, among a few alternatives, capable of producing this pattern. As it is, com-petition is probably unimportant in structuring the temporal organization of this guild. However, population densities and production may still be influenced by competition that occurs too infrequently to produce life-cycle adjustments and temporal separation.",

            "text": "It is also possible that competition has influenced the amount of temporal resource overlap among a few species of this guild without producing a regular pattern of peak resource utilization. If this were the case, then we would expect some of the pair-wise species production overlap values to be stnall. For example, Georgian & Wallace (1983) found that a scraper guild demonstrated a regular pattern of temporal peak production with remarkably small values of temporal overlap (ranging from 0.00 to 0.29) among speeies annual production curves. The amount of temporal overlap of species annual production curves for the members of this guild was high and ranged from 0.39 to 0.81. In addition, the pattern of peak resource utilization was aggregated for the guild as a whole and no different from random within Groups 1 and 2. For these reasons, we found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that interspecific competition has influenced the temporal patterns of resource utilization within this guild. Evidence suggests that in this stream, and other similar Rocky Mountain streams (Ward, Zitnmermann & Cline, 1986) , physical componetits may be more important than competitive interactions in structuring zoobenthie assemblages.",
