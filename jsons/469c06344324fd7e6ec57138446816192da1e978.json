            "text": "Governments worldwide are currently deliberating the feasibility of a national shutdown strategy to contain and mitigate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on their country's population. Testing for COVID-19 is mainly being done among at-risk individuals (eg, those with influenza-like symptoms, people who have had contact with an individual testing positive for COVID-19, healthcare professionals, or those with a travel history to an affected region), 1 thus an accurate value for how many individuals are truly infected is not known. Since at-risk individuals are not representative of the general population, it is impossible to obtain the true prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. Yet, establishing this value is vital to understand the morbidity and mortality risk in the population, particularly in lowincome and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India, which cannot absorb the socioeconomic and publichealth fallout resulting from national shutdowns.",

            "text": "In the absence of universal testing, a random-sample-based population surveillance framework is urgently needed. We propose using the well established Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) framework as a solution to ascertain the true prevalence of COVID-19. We use as an example the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), India's version of the DHS that is led by the International Institute of Population Sciences under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 2 In 2002, India was projected to have 25 million HIV-positive individuals, with a prevalence of HIV in adults of 3-4%. 3 These estimates were based on extrapolation of infection rates among selected at-risk individuals. India used the NFHS to test for HIV in the general population, and estimates were sharply reduced to 2\u00b75 million, with a prevalence of HIV in adults (aged 15-49 years) of 0\u00b728%. 4 This discrepancy showed the shortcomings of selective testing of at-risk individuals as the basis for understanding disease prevalence in a population. 5 The NFHS has state-of-the-art infrastructure with a ready sampling framework. For more than 25 years the NFHS has served India well, providing reliable estimates of various population, health, and nutrition indicators. Layering a COVID-19focused data-collection effort onto the NFHS infrastructure would keep operational costs low, with the major expense being laboratory costs for testing samples.",

Under a scenario of 0\u00b75% prevalence, we would only need a sample of about 3000 individuals to be tested. The minimum required sample size increases to just over 15 000 under a rarer scenario of 0\u00b71% prevalence and decreases to about 1500 if the anticipated prevalence is 1%. Should the anticipated prevalence of COVID-19 be any higher than 1%, the minimum sample size needed to reliably estimate the true prevalence would be smaller and, therefore, fewer resources would be needed.",
