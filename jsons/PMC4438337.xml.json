Enrolling children for a period of 12 months and incorporating monthly follow up will enable us to measure changes in predictors (e.g. child care attendance, changes in breastfeeding and vaccination status and exposure to tobacco smoke) and impacts over time.",

The collection of bilateral anterior nasal swabs on all study children will identify viral and bacterial pathogens associated with ARI and cough at both the time of enrolment, and at monthly time points and specialist review. An extended panel of known respiratory pathogens (previously discussed) was chosen to ensure that pathogens excluded from routine respiratory PCR testing were included for analysis and contribute to the literature on pathogens for which the association between nasal detection and clinical illness is still being explored (e.g. polyomaviruses) [28]. Using an extended panel also enhances our ability to explore viral and bacterial interactions and their effects on cough outcomes. However, associating viral detection with current illness is not straight forward as up to 42 % of children who have a non-classical virus detected are asymptomatic [29]. Also, co-detection of viruses and/or virus with bacteria are also commonly found in children with acute and chronic respiratory illnesses [30, 31].",

As MM services an area of predominantly low socio-economic status, ARI incidence and its predictors/outcomes may be higher than other settings. It is plausible that parents of children with recurrent ARI are more likely to enrol and complete the study, potentially overestimating the prevalence of chronic cough at day 28. Similarly children with existing undiagnosed chronic lung disease may be enrolled in the study also inflating the prevalence of chronic cough. However, the identification of these children will be an important outcome for the child and his/her family. Our extensive baseline data collection and comprehensive assessment of child at specialist review will allow assessment of these potential biases.",

However, retrospective collection of cough persistence and healthcare utilisation data at the time of enrolment will allow for assessment of such a bias.

At specialist review (where required), both the parent and treating physician report on cough type allowing for the assessment of inter-rater reliability and the potential for derived bias Through employing a small team of study specific respiratory specialists from the same centre, the potential for bias derived from inconsistency of diagnosis at the time of specialist review will be minimised.",
