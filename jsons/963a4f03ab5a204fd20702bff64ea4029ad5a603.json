There is evidence that also endothelial cells are infected by SARS-COV-2, with subsequent occurrence of systemic vasculitis, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Those effects, together with the \"cytokine storm\" are involved in a worse prognosis. In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In in vivo studies, ACE-Is and ARBs seem to paradoxically increase ACE-2 expression, which could favour SARS-CoV-2 infection of host's cells and tissues. By contrast, in patients treated with ACE-Is",

COVID-19-affected patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy [20] , with a concurrent massive elevation of von Willebrand Factor [21] towards massive endothelial stimulation and damage with release of von Willebrand Factor from Weibel-Palade bodies. In Chinese, Italian and French cohorts of COVID-19-affected patients, a substantial increase in D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, along with a longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time has additionally been documented as compared to uninfected patients [18, 20, 22] . Significantly higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, along with longer prothrombin and activated thromboplastin times were observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects who did not survive, with the 71.4% frequency of DIC in non-survivors and 0.6% in survivors highlighting the critical role played by such condition in COVID-19 severity and associated deaths [23] .",

ACE-2 function, following SARS-CoV binding, is reduced due to endocytosis and proteolytic cleavage [33] and there are high levels of Ang II in the blood of patients with COVID-19 [34, 35] . Consequently, the up-regulation of human ACE-2 induced by RAAS-antagonists in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could be clinically useful, due to the cardiovascular protection elicited by the increased activity of angiotensin(1-7), thereby attenuating angiotensin II effects on vasoconstriction and sodium retention [31, 34] . In vivo ACE-2 deficiency results in augmented vascular inflammation and plaque instability [36] , while its overexpression has been also shown to reduce left ventricular damage during myocardial infarction [37] . It has been additionally suggested that ACE-2 plays a key role in the reduction of left ventricular remodelling as well as in preserving ventricular function in humans [38] .",

The fact that the ACE-2-encoding gene is located on chromosome X [40] could be a relevant factor in this regard. The SARS-CoV-2 uses the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), an androgen-regulated gene, for viral spike protein priming [1] . ACE-2 receptor polymorphisms have, in silico, different affinities for the spike proteins SARS-CoV-2 [41] [42] [43] . Another confounding factor is smoke, with cigarette smoking increasing ACE-2 expression not only in experimental models [44] but also in humans [45] notwithstanding the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine. Respiratory tract inflammation can expand ACE-2 receptor availability for respiratory cell infection by SARS-CoV-2. This point is also controversial [46] , with the percentage of COVID-19-affected patients admitted to intensive care units in China being almost double in current smokers than in non-smokers [10] .",

Also the Position Statement of the Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology [53] strongly suggests that, since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 enzyme to infect host's cells, and although ACE-2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-Is and ARBs, there is currently lack of evidence supporting in humans the harmful effects of ACE-Is and ARBs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby recommending that physicians and patients should continue ongoing treatments with their usual anti-hypertensive therapies.",

With the aim of reinforcing the above-reported statements, some very recent studies further contribute to clarify the debate [54] [55] [56] . In a retrospective study on 1128 hospitalized COVID-19-affected patients with hypertension, including patients taking ACE-Is (17%) or ARBs (83%) with a median age of 64-66 years (about 52% of whom males) and an additional 940 COVID-19-affected patients treated by other anti-hypertensive drugs with a median age of 64 years (about 53% of whom males), the unadjusted casefatality rate was either significantly lower in the former group versus the non-ACE-Is/ARB group (3.7% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.01) [55, 56] , or both groups were equal in terms of severe disease and deaths [54] . Nevertheless, the Chinese cohorts consisted of younger patients and had less comorbidities than the Italian CoViD-19-affected patients who succumbed to the disease. Interestingly, the platelet count was significantly lower [55] , similarly to the prothrombin time [54] and the D-dimer [56] levels, in the ACE-Is-or ARB-treated, COVID-19-affected patients. After multivariate analysis for age, sex, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications [56] , the adjusted HR for the ACE-Is/ARB group was 0.42 (95% CI 0.19-0.92; P = 0.03). The cautious conclusion of the authors, due to the intrinsic limitations of a retrospective study, was that \"it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs was associated with an increased mortality risk\" [56] . Four very recent retrospective studies did not find any influence of the two RAAS-inhibitors on the clinical course [57] , the rate of inhospital death [58] or propensity of developing COVID-19 infection [59, 60] .",
