One aspect of shielding the vulnerable is to identify those at risk of developing serious and potentially life-threatening symptoms and distance them from sources of infection. More work is needed to identify such groups, which include people over the age of 65 and those with underlying health conditions. Another is to identify and isolate the infected. This is complicated by uncertainty as to whether efforts to produce a vaccine will succeed and how long it will take. It is possible that post-infection immunity may be short-lived (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2020, 9), and even if infection confers immunity, the ECDC estimates that 67% of the population would need to have had the virus in order to prevent ongoing transmission and that \u2018Some form of physical distancing interventions will therefore need to be in place for at least several months from now\u2019 (2020, 18). A second wave (and potentially further waves) of COVID-19 is possible (Xu and Li 2020).",

That is, a person contracting the novel virus will pass it on to an average of around 3 people. The R0 is a measure of potential transmissibility that is difficult to establish, particularly if the accuracy of the data is questionable as where, for example, there is under- or mis-reporting. Underlying the R0 is a considerable variation which, early in the outbreak, Mackenzie (2020) postulated may be down to the role of super-spreaders: around 10% of cases could be responsible for up to 80% of transmission. If so, she argued, control of super-spreading would be essential in tackling the outbreak.",

Some individuals are asymptomatic throughout, though the risk of transmission is probably somewhat lower in such cases. There have also been reports of COVID-19 positive tests during convalescence, following a negative test (Chen et al. 2020). COVID-19 may itself have super-spreading tendencies flowing from the occurrence of atypical symptoms (Wang et al. 2020), which may have led to a failure to identify many mild cases\u2014a phenomenon that has been exacerbated by limited and variable availability of testing, tracing and screening.",

Super-spreading is not a new phenomenon: symptomless \u2018Typhoid Mary\u2019 was exiled for 26 years for apparently infecting many others in the 1800s (Marineli et al. 2013), and super-spreading was thought to be a driver of MERS, SARS (2002\u20132003) and, to a lesser extent, Ebola (Wong et al. 2015). Stein (2011) observes that observational and modelling studies support a 20/80 rule whereby 20% of individuals are likely to contribute around 80% of the transmission potential in a given infectious disease. Many variables make up this tendency, and this has potential to limit the meaningfulness of the term.",

As for events, any large gathering or movement of groups or individuals can constitute super-spreading. So too can policy decisions or indeed any occurrence which in hindsight exacerbated infection rates, such as the lack of control measures when SARS first emerged and single cases were treated as atypical pneumonia and transmitted to others (WHO 2003). As highlighted above, COVID-19 itself has super-spreading tendencies given its potential for atypical symptoms and pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.",

Spreading can be exacerbated by poor hygiene or certain social practices such as hand shaking, but infection of others is not evidence alone that guidelines on behaviour have been ignored.

If any potential biological super-spreading tendencies of COVID-19 were better understood, then it could aid management and control through, for example, isolation or targeted vaccination if and when it becomes available. Research might usefully focus on the tendency of some individuals to shed high levels of the pathogen, including investigation of co-morbidity, genetics, viral load and infectivity at different stages of presentation. In COVID-19, the relationship between viral load, severity and infectivity is complex and poorly understood. Increased viral load does not necessarily result in more severe symptoms (Geddes 2020), and infection dose is currently uncertain.

Regulation 3(4) allows the Secretary of State, having had independent advice from the Confidentiality Advisory Group, to give notice to health organisations, general practices and local authorities that confidential information will be required (DHSC 2020) for a certain purpose. The purpose in this case is COVID-19 and includes understanding risks and trends including (amongst other things):locating, contacting, screening, flagging and monitoring such patients and collecting information about and providing services in relation to testing, diagnosis, self-isolation, fitness to work, treatment, medical and social interventions and recovery from Covid-19.

Whilst efforts will be made to protect the identity of the patients, anonymity is not a binary concept and, as argued above in relation to the Brighton case, media interest in \u2018super-spreaders\u2019 could lead to \u2018jigsaw identifiability\u2019 and to moral blame, which in turn could impact on trust.",

Consideration of the tendencies of individuals to exacerbate infection rates is a worthy focus of research. As more targeted public health responses are developed to replace widespread physical distancing policies, it is increasingly important that heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission is explored and factored into responses. To the extent that super-spreading is an aspect of research on heterogeneity, there is a risk that the negative connotations the term has attracted will result in public reticence to give up the private information upon which that research might depend. Greater accuracy of definition would help ensure that debate around the term is not at cross-purposes, help reduce or prevent moral blame of those who unwittingly infect others and could enhance public trust around the use of confidential data.",

Turning briefly to potential solutions, one option would be to avoid use of the term altogether, but it is well accepted in the scientific literature (see for example Lloyd-Smith 2005, Stein 2011, Gopinath 2014), and its abandonment could disrupt important linkage between current and previous research. Another option would be to encourage the use of the terms \u2018super-spreading\u2019 and \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 in epidemiology, in place of \u2018super-spreader\u2019. This might reduce stigma, but it is unlikely to limit more general (mis)application of the term. Another option would be to encourage the development of a clearer taxonomy of super-spreading so as to take scientific ownership of the term and discourage inappropriate lay adoption, potentially through a classification of behavioural, environmental and biological super-spreading.",
