            "text": "Obesity, as a major pandemic health problem, refers to the excessive and abnormal fat accumulation according to the definition of World Health Organization (WHO) [1], resulting from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure [2]. It is mostly defined as having body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 [3]. The prevalence of obesity has been increased dramatically in the past decades [4]. It has been estimated that approximately 1.35 billion and 573 million individuals will be obese and overweight by 2030 [5]. Recent studies show that obesity prevalence have been raised in Iranian adults in last years [5]. The interaction between genetic and life style behaviors including diet and physical activity have been recently attracted much attention in treatment and management of obesity and related disorders. Genetic and molecular epidemiological evidences suggest that there is a clear difference in the susceptibility to obesity and obesity-related disorders according to their genetic traits [6]. Accordingly, the adverse effects of obesity on cardio-metabolic risk factors has strong dependence to genetic variants and therefore, it is necessary to develop a tri-polar approach of gene-nutrient-metabolic risk factor interactions in molecular studies. So, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics studies can provide an understanding of the intra and inter population phenotypic differences in the effect of obesity on metabolic risk factors [7]. Over the past decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide gene encoding cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) protein as a neurotransmitter and hormone [8\u201310], located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus [11] and implicated in several physiological processes such as neurological disease, anxiety, stress, addiction, depression, endocrine function, specially feeding behavior, weight management and energy homeostasis [10\u201312]. CART prepropeptide gene located in chromosome 5q13-14 in coexistence of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons [12], contains one exon and two introns [11] and produces short peptide fragments [10, 13] (Fig. 1). Alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) as a derivative of POMC along with CART leads to energy expenditure enhancing food intake and appetite inhibition [10]. It has been identified that CART prepropeptide gene polymorphism is associated with obesity [14]. Also Rigoli et al. [15] declared that CART gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may affect CART expression which is associated with obesity in children. Other study by del-Giudice et al. [16] suggested the possible role of Leu34Phe mutation of CART gene might play an important role in obese phenotype by altering the CART mediated leptin effect on thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Likewise, understanding of gene-diet interactions may be more effective in prevention of the obesity-related phenotypes and their better management. The role of diet as one of lifestyle factors in preventing obesity and relevant non-communicable diseases and also maintaining good health is indisputable [17]. Since food and food ingredients including micro or macro-nutrients are usually consumed in combination of each other in a usual diet and as a consequent they will have numerous synergistic or even inhibitory interactions, it is logical to study their simultaneous effects in the diet rather than studying their isolate actions; dietary pattern approach, accounting complexity of the diet, provides the opportunity to approve the real image of a diet on health outcome [18]. Among priori-defined dietary pattern approaches, as known as \u2018diet quality indices\u2019, including diet quality index International (DQI-I) and healthy eating index (HEI) [19, 20] have been known as being cardio-protective. DQI-I is developed to clarify dietary variations among population; whereas, HEI-2015, the most recently updated version is a nutrient density-based approach [21]. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the interaction between CARTPT genotype and dietary indices and the effects of these interactions on anthropometric and metabolic risk factors in obese individuals.",

The highest and lowest consumption of three adequacy components (e.g., whole grains, dairy and fatty acids) scored 10 and 0, respectively. Other Six adequacy components include total fruits (fruit, fruit juice and canned fruit), whole fruits (fruits except fruit juice), total vegetables, seafood and plant proteins, greens and beans, and total protein foods; each scored at 5 for the highest and 0 for the lowest consumption. A maximum of 10 points was given to the lowest consumption of four moderation components includes refined grains, sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. However, the highest consumption of these items was scored as 0. Intermediate intake of every component was scored proportionally. Higher overall HEI-2015 scores shows greater alignment with DGA recommendation and better diet quality [21].",

Basic characteristics of study participants across the CART rs2239670 genotypes have been presented in Table 1. Genotype prevalence among study participants was as follow: AA (5.4%), AG (20.4%), GG (74.1%) and AA (15.6%), AG (20%), GG (64.4%) in men and women respectively. Significant differences had been shown about age distribution among genotypes in men (P < 0.05). Table 2 indicates biochemical parameters of participants according to CARTPT gene rs2239670 polymorphisms. There were statistically significant difference in terms of \u03b1-MSH (P = 0.010), AgRP (P = 0.019) in women and glucose (P = 0.05) and HOMA (P = 0.035) in men across CARTPT gene rs2239670 genotypes. While higher amounts of these parameters were observed in AA genotype compared with other genotypes. Figure 2 presents CARTPT-HEI interactions and their effects on several anthropometric and biochemical variables. Accordingly, CARTPT-HEI interactions affect basal metabolic rate (BMR; PInteraction = 0.003), glucose (PInteraction = 0.009), HDL (PInteraction = 0.03) after adjusting for sex and age. The risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome was not homogenous in CART genotype groups, across tertiles of HEI. The lowest BMR was observed in the AG genotype with moderate compliance with the HEI; highest BMR values was observed in highest HEI tertile in AA and AG genotypes. AA genotype had also the highest fasting serum glucose concentrations even in highest adherence to HEI. While being in AG or GG genotype reduced serum glucose concentrations (P = 0.009). Also the lowest HDL was observed in the AG genotype with moderate adherence to the HEI; while its concentrations reduced in highest tertile. As a conclusion, HEI could not modify the adverse effects of being in AA genotype of CARTPT. Whereas, gene-diet interactions were more pronounced for CARTPT DQI-I compared with CARTPT-HEI as represented for FM (PInteraction = 0.02), WC (PInteraction < 0.001), BMI (PInteraction < 0.001), BMR (PInteraction < 0.001), serum fasting glucose (P Interaction < 0.001) and AgRP (PInteraction = 0.05) even after adjusting for potential confounders (Fig. 3). Higher adherence to DQI-I scores reduced fasting serum glucose and Ag-RP levels in AA genotype; while individuals with lower adherence to DQI-I exhibited a higher serum fasting glucose and Ag-RP concentrations. Accordingly, highest adherence to DQI-I index reduced FM, BMI, fasting serum glucose and Ag-RP in AA genotype while increased BMR values further highlighting the beneficial effects of high adherence to DQI-I to reduce the adverse obesity-related risk factors. The interaction between HEI or DQI-I and other anthropomeric or biochemical parameters were not statistically significant while the related information are provided in supporting information (Additional file 1: Figures S1 and S2).

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigated the interactions between CARTPT rs2239670 genes with dietary indices in terms of metabolic parameters. We demonstrated that AA genotype was the possible risk factor of metabolic disorders and adherence to higher diet quality index of DQI-I reduced the metabolic risk in obese individuals. While these interactive role was not favorite for HEI. As elucidated above AA homozygote genotype can increase metabolic abnormalities like serum fasting glucose level despite high adherence to HEI and DQI-I and also can increase FM, BMI, AgRP even in high compliance with DQI-I. The role of CARTPT gene in obesity has been studied in several previous works; Two variants, 1457delA and A1475G, in the coding region of CARTPT gene were detected in Danish Caucasians with early onset obesity in Echwald et al. study [27]. In addition, according to the results of Challis study, the A1475G and 1457delA variants are not associated with obesity in Caucasian population in the U.K, and the A1475G SNP was significantly associated with lower WHR, fasting plasma insulin, and fasting triglycerides [28]. Likewise, no association was reported between C1442G variant of CARTPT gene and obesity in a group of obese Pima Indians [29]. In contrast, Yamada et al. [30] demonstrated that the A-156G variant of the CARTPT gene was associated with obesity in the Japanese population. Accordingly, our results were in line with other Asian populations in Korea [31] and Malaysia [32] where the majority of the participants had GG genotype about the genotype prevalence and allele frequency of this gene polymorphism. Moreover, consistent with our findings, there was no significant difference in term of anthropometric measurements and blood pressures among the genotypes [12]. Although the underlying mechanisms for these different results remain poorly understood, differences in dietary habits and other socio-demographic factors in studied populations may contribute to these inconsistent outcomes. Although, no study is available evaluating the CARTPT gene-interactions with dietary indices and their effects on metabolic parameters in obesity, but numerous previous studies are available investigating the interaction between single nucleotide gene polymorphisms with diet or dietary ingredients in the pathogenesis of obesity-related comorbidities; for example the interaction between Mediterranean dietary pattern and FTO gene variants [33], dietary inflammatory index and VEGF genotype [34], and the role of dietary approach to stop hypertension interaction with insulin receptor substrate-1gene expression [35] affecting obesity and obesity related metabolic phenotypes are available in literature. Our findings revealed the interactive role of DQI-I in reducing obesity related metabolic profile including BMI, FM and FSG and AgRP in AA genotype of CARTPT; no human study is available evaluating the relationship between AgRP and CART gene polymorphisms. However, increased AgRP in obesity had been reported in several previous reports [36\u201338]. The possible underlying mechanism of increased AgRP in obesity is hypothalamic re-sistance to its function due to increased leptin concentrations in obese individuals [39]. In terms of CARTPT-HEI interactions, being in highest tertiels of HEI could not show favorable effects in reducing metabolic risk factors; for example FM increased while HDL decreased in highest adherence to HEI in AA genotype. Similarly, Sanjeevi et al. and Kirwan et al. reported that a whole grain-rich diet with high adherence to HEI score significantly reduced serum HDL concentrations in overweight and obese adults [40, 41].",
