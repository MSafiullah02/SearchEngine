Antibodies against the SARS proteins can be obtained in different ways. The most commonly used are hybridomas to make monoclonal antibodies 25 and immunization followed by collection of antiserum. 26 Selections using phage display have been performed, selecting scFv antibodies from semi-synthetic (nonimmune) libraries 27-29 and with immune library. 30 The first time a fusion protein was displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophages was in 1985 by G.P. Smith, 31 who showed that foreign DNA fragments could be inserted in the middle of gene III to create a fusion protein. The phage particle displays a protein or peptide on the surface and carries the gene for the displayed protein or peptide inside the particle, giving a linkage between phenotype and genotype. 31 This allows for the selection of phage displaying a protein or peptide with affinity for a given target, and at the same time the gene encoding the protein or peptide is co-selected. In this way, it is possible to screen millions of different displayed proteins or peptides.",

The immune libraries are made from immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region (V) genes derived from immunized donors. 37 An immune library is biased toward a specific antigen, which leads to the selection of higher-affinity antibodies (compared to na\u00efve libraries of the same size). The na\u00efve libraries are made from Ig V genes derived from nonimmunized donors or from synthetic V-genes. 36 The na\u00efve library is unbiased and can therefore select antibodies against virtually any antigen.",
