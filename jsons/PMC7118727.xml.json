Airborne and droplet transmission are the major routes for spreading viral diseases, such as smallpox, influenza, measles, and mumps. Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and influenza virus have attracted public attention and are believed to be transmitted by aerosol. Virus droplets generated from sneezing or coughing typically range from 1 to 100\u03bcm in size and will evaporate to droplet nuclei that approach the size of the individual microbe (Kowalski & Bahnfleth, 1998). Such droplet nuclei remain airborne for long periods of time (up to 1 day) with potential for retention in the respiratory tract (Ijaz, Karim, Sattar, & Johnson-Lussenburg, 1987). When a virus is encased in a droplet, its infectivity is enhanced due to shielding from drying, temperature, and sunlight, compared to an isolated airborne virus (Tyrrell, 1967). Due to such droplet encasement, virus-containing aerosols less than 2\u03bcm in size have higher infectivity than those of the virus itself (Couch et al., 1965).",

For safety concerns during experiments, a single type of bacteriophage, MS2, has been typically used as a substitute for pathogenic viruses (Harstad, 1965, Hatch and Warren, 1969, Trouwborst and de Jong, 1972). However, MS2 cannot represent all types of viruses due to the wide range of structures and nucleic acids. Using an Andersen 6-STG sampler, Ijaz et al. (1987) demonstrated that 87% of aerosolized viruses have a particle size smaller than 2.1\u03bcm. Studies show that the collection efficiency of impingers for infective viruses is superior to that of filters (Hatch and Warren, 1969, Dubovi and Akers, 1970; Trouwborst, de Jong, & Winkler, 1972), and that RH, stress during sampling, and the extraction process strongly influence the collection efficiency of a biosampler for a virus (Harstad, 1965, Ijaz et al., 1987).",

Such delay gives the organisms an opportunity to multiply or die in transit (Thorne, Kiekhaefer, Whitten, & Donham, 1992). Although the effect of storage time and temperature on survival of bacterial and fungal aerosols collected using impingers has been reported (Li and Lin, 2001, Lin and Li, 2003), the effect on survival of virus aerosols has not yet been reported until our current study. Although a virus is an obligate parasite and cannot multiply without a host in the collection medium, virus infectivity might still be affected by the sampling method, storage temperature, storage duration, and sample processing. The results for collection efficiency from the previous sampling studies of aerosolized virus discussed above (Hatch and Warren, 1969, Dubovi and Akers, 1970, Trouwborst et al., 1972) could not be compared due to the use of different sampling devices, evaluation indexes, and virus targets. The collection efficiencies of different sampling devices for collecting infective viruses with different morphology and nucleic acid types needs further investigation.",

A high titer stock of bacteriophages (109\u20131010 PFU/mL) Plaque forming units (PFU) was prepared via plate lysis and elution. To allow the phage to attach to the host, the bacteriophages were mixed with their own respective host. First, 5 ml of top agar was added to a sterile tube of infected cells. Then, the contents of the tube were mixed by gentle tapping for 5 s and poured onto the center of a labeled agar plate. Finally, the plate was incubated for 24 h either at 37\u2218C for coliphages or at 26\u2218C for phi 6. After cultivation, 5 ml SM buffer (containing NaCl, MgSO4\u00b77H2O, Tris, and gelatin) was pipetted onto a plate that showed confluent lysis. Then, the plate was slowly rocked for 40 min and the buffer was transferred to a tube for centrifugation at 4000\u00d7g for 10 min. After the supernatant was removed, the resulting phage stock was stored at 4\u2218C . Plaque assay described by Adams (1959) was then used to measure the bacteriophage concentrations.",

These bacterial and fungus results were also suitable for aerosolized virus. Therefore, total recovery (TR) is not a good indicator for collection efficiency of samplers; here, TR is defined as Ctest/C0, where Ctest is PFU/m3, i.e., the number of infective virus particles per cubic meter of air passed through the sampler, and C0 is the total number of virus particles per cubic meter of air passed through a particle counter. To better understand the collection efficiency for virus aerosols, the viability of microorganisms in liquid suspension used as the source of the generated bioaerosols should be evaluated. Therefore, in this study, we used a parameter called relative recovery (RR) as an indicator for collection efficiency of the samplers; here, RR is defined as Ctest /Csusp, where Csusp is the PFU/mL in the suspension, i.e., number of infective virus particles in the suspension.",

After virus air sampling by using the AGI-30, the first sample from the liquid collection medium was inoculated as soon as possible (5 min) for the initial concentration, C0. Each sample of collected virus was separated into two equal portions, one of which was then stored at 25\u2218C (room temperature) and the other refrigerated at 4\u2218C . To obtain a kinetic curve of concentration variation up to 1-day storage, each storage suspension was inoculated for plaque assay at storage times of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h.

The RR for T7 (Fig. 4\n) at RH 85% was similar to that for MS2 and phi X174, but was much lower (1 log decrease) at RH 20% and 55%. At all RH levels, the RR for phi 6 (Fig. 5\n) ranged between 4\u00d710-4 and 6\u00d710-4, significantly lower than those for the other three viruses. These differences might be because MS2 and phi X174 phages are lipid-free icosahedral viruses, and are therefore more resistant to sampling stress compared to T7, which has a tail fiber, and to phi 6, which has a lipid envelope. The observed higher RR for the tailed phage T7 at high RH (85% RH) might be due to the formation of a moisture film that protects the delicate tail fibers of this phage from sampling stress (Hatch & Warren, 1969). Because the lipid content of phi 6 is extremely sensitive to environmental stress (Woolwine & Gerberding, 1995), the low RR of phi 6 might be related to the lipid content being affected by the sampling stress, such as impaction and dehydration. The lipid content of phi 6 reportedly is essential for infectivity (Woolwine & Gerberding, 1995).",

These findings agree well with those reported for tailed phages T1 and T3 collected using an impinger (Harstad, 1965, Hatch and Warren, 1969).

The RR was extremely low for both the phi 6 (Fig. 5) at all three RH levels (1\u00d710-5) and for T7 (Fig. 4) at RH 20% and 55% (2\u00d710-5). The RR for T7 at RH 85% was 2\u00d710-3, higher than those at RH 20% and 55%. Because all four of the test virus aerosols in this study were larger than the 0.4-\u03bcm pore size of this nuclepore filter, penetration of the virus aerosols through the filter should be negligible. The observed loss of virus infectivity (reflected by the extremely low RR) in samples collected using a nuclepore filter is probably primarily related to the biological stress during filtration, dehydration during sampling, and extraction process (Li et al., 1999).",

            "text": "In summary, our results showed that both the morphology of the virus particles and the presence or absence of a lipid envelope significantly affected the collection efficiency of the four evaluated bioaerosol samplers and affected the infectivity of the collected virus sample. The Andersen impactor, impinger, and gelatin filter were found superior to the nuclepore filter for sampling hydrophilic viruses. In addition, the RR values of hydrophobic viruses (i.e., phi 6) (viruses with a lipid envelope) was lower than that of hydrophilic viruses (i.e., MS2, phi X174 and T7), because lipid is extremely sensitive to sampling stress, and virus recoveries of MS2, phi X174, and phi 6 did not depend on RH, whereas that of T7, which has a tail fiber, strongly depended on RH. These results are similar to those previously reported for bacteria, endospores, and fungal spores (Lin & Li, 1999b). Specifically, when the impactor or impinger were used for virus collection, the RR values for MS2 and phi X174 viruses were similar to those for E. coli and yeast cells, but lower than those for endospore B. subtilis and Penicillium (Li & Lin, 1999b; Li et al., 1999; Lin & Li, 1999a). When the gelatin filter was used, the RR values for MS2 and phi X174 virus were lower than that for Penicillium, were similar to those for B. subtilis and yeast, and were higher than that for E. coli (Lin & Li, 1998; Li & Lin, 1999a). When the nuclepore filter was used, the recoveries for MS2 and phi X174 virus were lower than those reported for Penicillium and B. subtilis and were similar to those for yeast and E. coli (Li et al., 1999; Lin & Li, 1999b).",

When stored at room temperature, Phi 6 retained little infectivity (<10%) in all three media (Fig. 9\n), but when refrigerated, it retained more than 80% infectivity in either deionized water or peptone broth. Based on previous studies indicating that salt solution might lower the infectivity of phage because of sampling stress of unbalanced forces at the air\u2013water interface (Dubovi and Akers, 1970, Trouwborst and de Jong, 1973), the infectivity of phage phi 6 could be significantly affected by the salt in the nutrient broth during the impingement and thus cause the loss of virus infectivity. No plaque was found in the MS2, phi X174, and phi 6 samples in nutrient broth stored for 24 h at room temperature, possibly due to interference of plaque assay. Further study is needed, however, to confirm this interference.",

The unsuitability of the nuclepore filter was possibly due to sampling stress during filtration, to dehydration during sampling, and to the extraction process.
