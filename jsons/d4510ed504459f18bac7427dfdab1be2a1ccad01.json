Host susceptibility and responses to infection are known to be heterogeneous, and the identification of common genetic variants linked to disease outcome by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has underscored the significance of host polymorphisms in responses to infection. Several such GWAS have highlighted the IFN-\u03bb locus on chromosome 19q13 as an area of genetic variation significantly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the rs12979860 genotype can be used in clinical practice as a biomarker for predicting a successful response to treatment with pegylated IFN and ribavarin.

Type I IFNs cause a rapid peak and fall of ISG expression, whereas IFN-\u03bbs induce a steady increase and prolonged expression of ISGs due in part to their induction of the constituents of the transactivator ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9) [13] [14] [15] [16] . As IFN-\u03bb subtypes are differentially expressed (with IFN-\u03bb1 requiring IRF1 and NF-\u03baB in addition to IRF3 and IRF7), the variation in ISG activation between the subtypes is likely attributable to relative levels of IFN-\u03bb subtypes as well as receptor binding affinities and tissue-specific expression of transcription activators (e.g. IRF1 and Med23), and repressors (e.g. Zeb1) [12, [17] [18] [19] [20] . These differences in IFN expression, receptor utilisation and subsequent ISG induction between and within the 3 IFN families suggest that they are likely to have complementary roles in host defence against invading pathogens.",

A similar study found a haplotype with 6 polymorphisms [rs12980275, rs8105790, rs8103142, rs10853727, rs8109886 and rs8099917 (GCCTAG)] to be overrepresented in patients who failed to respond to treatment, and in particular the minor G allele at both rs12980275 and rs8099917 was found to be strongly linked to a failure to clear infection (null virological response; NVR) [5, 6] .",

The dinucleotide variant (TT/\u0394G) rs368234815 (or ss469415590) has recently been identified, and the \u0394G frame shift allele, which leads to expression of IFN-\u03bb4, is the major variant in Africans and the strongest known host factor for predicting failure to clear HCV in this population [9] . The homozygous TT genotype at this locus also has a strong positive correlation with HCV clearance and treatment outcome [45] [46] [47] . Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs found within the IFN-\u03bb region is a prominent feature and makes it difficult to assign a causative role to individual SNPs, particularly if they are far apart. In sickle cell anaemia, for example, a functional SNP has been found in high LD with SNPs up to 2.5 Mbp away [48] . In the context of IFN-\u03bb3 polymorphisms, the high LD observed between rs12979860 and rs368234815 (r 2 = 0.988) gives the latter SNP limited use as a marker in this population ( fig. 2 ) [49] . However, the evidence that the rs368234815 genotype actually provides a better prediction of therapy outcome in Caucasians co-infected with HIV-1 and HCV highlights the difficulties in forming reliable associations between disease and SNPs [50] .",

Of the numerous SNPs within the IFN-\u03bb locus ( fig. 1 ), many are located in the promoter region and could directly influence protein expression by altering the transcription factor binding affinity or chromatin accessibility [61, 62] . For example, SNPs rs12978960, rs4803221 and rs368234815 are proposed to be located within a CpG island [17, 45, 62, 63] . Methylation and deamination at CpG islands cause epigenetic changes promoting the recruitment of proteins associated with less transcriptionally active heterochromatic DNA and thus may alter IFN-\u03bb3 expression. Whilst a recent investigation into the transcriptional regulation of IFN-\u03bb suggested that the majority of the control occurs within the first kilo base pair upstream of IL28B, excluding both rs12979860 and rs8099917, it is well established that the risk alleles at these SNPs (T and G, respectively) alter the mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sera and the liver in HCV patients as well as healthy individuals [5, 6, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] .",

Considering the substantial side effect burden of IFN therapy, patients may be reluctant to start treatment, but knowledge of their IL28B genotype and likely response to treatment can facilitate a more informed decision.

The minor T allele at rs12979860 was found to be associated with the severity and frequency of oral herpes labialis recurrence [20] . A more recent study in HIV-infected patients found that individuals homozygous for the \u0394G mutation at SNP rs368234815 had a higher incidence of developing CMV retinitis [77] . Infection of retinal epithelial cells by CMV causes retinal damage resulting in blindness, and the reduced IFN-\u03bb3 expression as a result of this \u0394G mutation may contribute to higher replication levels of CMV and an increased likelihood of developing retinitis. IFN-\u03bb SNPs have also been investigated in the context of HIV 'controllers' who suppress the HIV viral load in the absence of therapy. One such study found the protective rs12979860 CC genotype to be associated with spontaneous HIV control; however, in addition to having very low numbers in comparison to noncontrollers (53 vs. 389 ), this group also had a high rate of HCV co-infection, making firm conclusions difficult [78] .",

            "text": "Despite being the major IFN expressed in airway cells in response to infection [26] [27] [28] , surprisingly little is known about the effect of IFN-\u03bb SNPs on respiratory infectious diseases. One study exploring the SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 in infants hospitalised with RSV-associated bronchiolitis found no link to the course of clinical infection or viral load even though a significant association between raised IFN-\u03bb1 levels in airway secretions and the severity of disease in infants hospitalised due to RSV bronchiolitis has been observed [83, 84] . This apparent negative link between IFN-\u03bb and disease prognosis raises the possibility that overexpression of IFN-\u03bb may actually be detrimental to patient health, particularly in the context of respiratory infections. In such infections, the predominant induction of IFN-\u03bb may contribute significantly to the phenomenon of hypercytokinaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation in lifethreatening disease [85] . [86] . IFN-\u03bb suppresses allergic asthma in mouse models as a result of promoting Th1 and suppressing Th2 responses [88, 89] , and bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients are impaired in their ability to express IFN-\u03bb in response to infection [90] . It is possible, therefore, that polymorphisms that reduce IFN-\u03bb levels are responsible for a dominance of Th2 cells and the resultant inflammatory and allergic diseases, and one study found the risk T allele at rs12979860 to be overrepresented in a cohort of allergy sufferers [87] . However, contradictory reports of elevated IFN-\u03bb levels in asthma patients [91, 92] indicate the need for further studies to elucidate the role of IFN-\u03bb and its polymorphisms in inflammatory disease.",

Interestingly, the IL28RA SNP rs4649203 minor allele is linked to an increased risk of SLE in the Chinese Han population [96] and, whilst the effect of this polymorphism is not known, its location in the 3 \u2032 UTR sug-gests that it may influence receptor expression. Whilst the underlying cause of SLE remains undefined, an infectious agent has long been suspected [reviewed in 96 ] . It is unsurprising, therefore, to find links between host polymorphisms influencing IFN-\u03bb pathways and SLE, and the role of IFN-\u03bb in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "The most studied SNP in the IFN-\u03bb locus, rs12979860, shows extensive geographical variation in allele frequencies, with the C allele, associated with clearance of HCV, present at very high (>90%) rates in East-Asian populations and at low rates (<40%) in African populations ( fig. 3 a) . This disparity in C allele frequency correlates with the observed clinical differences between these populations, where East Asians have a more than 3 times greater rate of HCV clearance [42, 97] . The ethnicity-dependent distribution of the protective CC genotype also partially explains the differences in SVR between African Americans and European Americans, where chronic infection occurs more often in people of African descent (76.4%) compared to Caucasian populations (44%) [4] . Such variation in allele frequencies is A v e r a g e C a u c a s i a n A s i a n 238 also likely to contribute to the global variations in 'predictor' genotypes, such as the SNPs rs8099917 and rs368134815 being the strongest predictors of HCV therapy outcome in Japanese and African populations, respectively [9, 43] . Intra-regional variation in SNP allele frequencies is also noted, with CC frequencies ranging from 80% in Asian Australians to 19% in Mediterranean Australians ( fig. 3b ) [98] , and this high level of variation even within the relatively small population of Australians ( \u223c 23 million) should be considered when utilising genotypes for patient stratification. The observed correlation between geographically distinct genotypes and chronic disease prevalence provides evolutionary evidence for maintenance of the protective alleles in the IFN-\u03bb SNPs, i.e. maintenance of a CC at rs12989760 in areas endemic for chronic HCV. However, this does not explain the high prevalence of the so-called 'risk' T allele at this SNP in populations such as the Australian Aboriginal and Mediterranean populations. In some well-known genetic disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia, individuals homozygous for the mutation in question suffer severe disease, whilst the heterozygosity actually confers a level of protection against malaria. It is possible, therefore, that the risk allele at rs12979860 may confer some as yet unidentified genetic advantage to some populations whilst simultaneously rendering others susceptible to chronic diseases such as HCV.",

Whilst the assessment of host genetics contributes to diagnostic and therapy options in oncology, this is surprisingly underexploited in other fields of medicine. The IL28B polymorphism rs12979860 is the only host SNP to be used as a genetic biomarker for infectious diseases, and genotyping at this locus is incorporated into patient stratification for the clinical management of HCV infection [100] . Whilst the link between IFN-\u03bb polymorphisms and HCV infection is the most robust and well described, this review has highlighted a number of other infectious and inflammatory diseases in which polymorphisms affecting IFN-\u03bb expression or signalling have been implicated. The data for many of these diseases, however, remain unconvincing. Many studies have been limited by often very small sample sizes and small effect sizes, and variations in patient characteristics make inter-study comparisons difficult. Given the levels of intra-regional genotype variation within some populations, caution should be used when interpreting the population stratification in such association studies, particularly in those with relatively high p values. Finally, the existence of LD between SNPs within the IFN-\u03bb locus makes it difficult to assign causality to an individual polymorphism. However, it seems likely that host polymorphisms affecting the IFN-\u03bb signalling axis will play a key role in the advancing field of novel host biomarkers for patient management and differential therapy.",
