            "text": "With the popularity of Location-based Social Networks, Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important task, which learns the users' preferences and mobility patterns to recommend POIs. Previous studies show that incorporating contextual information such as geographical and temporal influences is necessary to improve POI recommendation by addressing the data sparsity problem. However, existing methods model the geographical influence based on the physical distance between POIs and users, while ignoring the temporal characteristics of such geographical influences. In this paper, we perform a study on the user mobility patterns where we find out that users' check-ins happen around several centers depending on their current temporal state. Next, we propose a spatio-temporal activity-centers algorithm to model users' behavior more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual model by incorporating it into the matrix factorization model under two different settings: (i) static and (ii) temporal. To show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which we refer to as STACP, we conduct experiments on two well-known real-world datasets acquired from Gowalla and Foursquare LBSNs. Experimental results show that the STACP model achieves a statistically significant performance improvement, compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Also, we demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing geographical and temporal information for modeling users' activity centers and the importance of modeling them jointly.",

            "text": "One of the most important challenges that limit the accuracy of POI recommendation is the data sparsity problem [1, 25, 26] . Numerous users are active on LBSNs with millions of POIs already being listed on these platforms. However, in practice, users are able to only visit a very limited number of POIs. Hence, the user-POI matrix used in different Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches becomes sparse, limiting the attainable recommendation accuracy [3, 24] . To address this problem, several studies have incorporated contextual information such as geographical and temporal influences separately into their model [7, 21, 30, 31] . For example, relevant studies have tried to incorporate geographical [9, 21, 28] and temporal influences [16, 20, 27] in their proposed model. Moreover, as argued in [9] [10] [11] , users commonly check in to POIs around several geographical centers. While modeling these centers it is assumed that they are static and do not change according to temporal information. This assumption may not be correct and taking into account both geographical and temporal influences might help to model the users' behavior with a higher accuracy. For instance, if we consider working time and leisure time, this suggests that users tend to explore POIs around their activity centers in leisure time, while they prefer to visit the same locations more often while they are at work. For example, a person would go to the same restaurant every day to have lunch while working during the weekdays. However, the same user might decide to visit a more diverse set of POIs and visit new places while on holidays (i.e., leisure time). Therefore, the users' check-in behavior and activity centers are dependent on their temporal states (e.g., working time vs. leisure time).",

As seen, this user follows a temporal center-based check-in pattern; that is, the activity centers are different at different temporal states. Also, while we compare Fig. 1a with Figs. 1b and c, we see that the activity centers are different from each temporal state, compared to all the check-ins. Based on these observations, we conclude that joint modeling of geographical and temporal information is an effective approach for defining users' activity centers. In this paper, we take a step for joint modeling of geographical and temporal information. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: -We propose a novel contextual model that jointly considers both geographical and temporal information. -We propose a spatio-temporal activity-centers model that consider users' center-based behavior in different temporal states. -We propose static and temporal MF models to study the users' preference and behavior both in static and temporal manners. In the static MF, we train the model on the whole user-POI matrix, whereas in the temporal MF, we train the model using different user-POI matrices for every time slot. -We address the data sparsity problem by incorporating the proposed contextual model into the traditional MF model and propose a novel MF framework.",

Much work has been carried out in this area based on the core idea behind recommendation systems, assuming that users with similar behavioral histories tend to act similarly [28] . Collaborative Filtering (CF-based) recommendation approaches aim to base recommendations on the similarity between users and items [14, 16] . POI recommendation considers a large number of available POIs (items) while a single user can only visit a few of them. Hence, CF-based approaches applied to POI recommendation often suffer from the data sparsity problem. This leads to poor performance in POI recommendation. Many studies have tried to address the data sparsity problem of CF approaches incorporating additional information into the model [5, 21, 22, 28] . As the users' check-in behavior follows a spatio-temporal mobility pattern, much work has incorporated this critical information. Considering users' movement trajectories between POIs, many of the previous studies have shown that geographical influence is one of the most important factors in POI recommendation [22, 24] .",

[28] argued that a user's check-in behavior is affected by the geographical influence of POIs, following the power-law distribution and proposed a unified POI recommender system incorporating spatial and social influences to address the data sparsity problem. Ference et al. [14] took into consideration several factors such as user preference, geographical proximity, and social influences for out-of-town POI recommendation. This work, however, did not take into account users' temporal information and in-town users' behavior. Cheng et al. [9, 10] modeled users' check-ins via center-based Gaussian distribution to capture users' movement patterns based on the assumption that users' movements consist of several centers. Li et al. [21] , in another work, modeled the POI recommendation task as a pairwise ranking loss, where they exploited the geographical information using an extra factor matrix. Zhang et al. [31] proposed a method that considered the geographical influence on each user separately. To this end, they proposed a model based on kernel density estimation of the distance distributions between POI check-ins per user. Aliannejadi et al. [2] proposed a ranking model and predicted the appropriateness of a POI given a user's context into the ranking process. Yuan et al. [29] addressed the data sparsity problem based on the idea that users tend to rank higher those POIs that are geographically closer to their visited POIs. Guo et al. [17] proposed a location neighborhood-aware weighted matrix factorization model to exploit the location perspective that incorporates the geographical relationships among POIs. More recently, Aliannejadi et al. [6] proposed a two-phase collaborative ranking algorithm for POI recommendation that takes into account the geographical influence of POIs in the same neighborhood.",

Dacrema et al. in [12] show that even some state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods are not able to outperform a non-personalized method such as TopPopular. This is the reason why we have also selected this method as a baseline to compare with STACP. It seems that in comparison to two non-personalized baseline methods, TopPopular and PFM, our method achieves significantly better performance. Comparing with other geographical-based methods, PFMPD, PFMMGM, iGLSR, and L-WMF, it is seen that STACP followed by Rank-GeoFM perform best. One reason for the performance of Rank-GeoFM is that it considers the geographical neighborhoods as a major element in the factorization method. Also, Rank-GeoFM takes a ranking approach to modeling the interactions between users and POIs. This means that instead of considering a point-wise loss function, it applies a pairwise loss function in geographical factorization.",

Also, our proposed model outperforms the LRT and LMFT that modeled temporal information to improve the accuracy of POI recommendation. The reason is that these methods do not consider the geographical information. Compared to the neural baseline, MLP, the improvements of STACP in terms of Recall@20 and nDCG@20 on Gowalla dataset are 65% and 66%, respectively.

As seen in Table 1 , STACP exhibits a significant improvement over STACP-NoTC in terms of all evaluation metrics for both datasets. We see that STACP improves STACP-NoTC by 42% in terms of Recall@20.

As such, we train STACP, as well as all the baseline methods with different data sizes. To do so, for each user, we only consider a certain percentage of visited POIs in the training set randomly, ranging from 40% to 100%. We see in Figs. 2a and b the performance of STACP and all baseline models in terms of nDCG@20 for different training data sizes. The results show that STACP is more effective in comparison with the baselines as the size of the training data varies, indicating that it addresses the data sparsity problem more effectively. As we see in Fig. 2a , when we change the data size from 100% to 40% on Gowalla, the performance of STACP decreases by about 35%, while for the competitor baseline method Rank-GeoFM the value of decrease is 45%. This shows that STACP is more robust when we do not have access to enough data from users. More interesting, the performance of LMFT, a temporal-information-based competitor baseline, decreases by 65% when the size of data changes to 40%. This indicates the unsuitability of the methods that only consider the temporal information. Also, it is worth noting that we observe a more robust behavior of STACP compared to the STACP-NoCN. Thus, the proposed context model enables STACP to deal with noise and data sparsity more effectively. This is clearer when STACP outperforms the best competitor baseline (i.e., Rank-GeoFM) with a larger margin, 33%, in terms of nDCG@20 on Gowalla. Figure 3 shows the performance of STACP for different values of d, \u03b1 and \u03bb. We report in Fig. 3a the effect of different values of d on the performance of STACP in terms of Precision@20 and Recall@20 metrics, respectively. It can be seen that the optimal value of d for both datasets is 15. These results show that users tend to visit nearby POIs to their centers, which are formed in regions. Figure 3b , on the other hand, shows the effect of different \u03b1 values on the performance of STACP. We can see that the optimal value is achieved at \u03b1 = 0.02 for both datasets. More importantly, as seen in Fig. 3c , the optimal value for \u03bb that shows the impact of different temporal states is 0.5. This confirms our assumption and shows that users follow a spatio-temporal activity centered behavior. In fact, when we set this parameter to 1 (i.e., just working time) or 0 (i.e., just leisure time), the performance decreases.",
