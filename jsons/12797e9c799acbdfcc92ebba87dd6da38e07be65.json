There are, however, a few documented epizootics and epornitics among threatened and endangered species. Many of these have involved captive animals, compromising captive propagation programs through decreased numbers of breeders and loss of genetically valuable individuals. The intent of this Thorne Black-footed Ferrets 67 paper is to describe the events leading up to and surrounding a case in which disease played a major role in the management and conservation of an endangered species and to provide examples of other diseases that may affect endangered species conservation programs. Canine distemper is a highly contagious disease of domestic dogs and some wild carnivores (Budd 198 1 ), and morbidity and mortality may be quite high in susceptible populations (Appel et al. 1981) . The disease, caused by a morbillivirus of the paramyxovirus group, occurs throughout the world and is ubiquitous in domestic and wild species (Budd 1981) . Closely related viruses include rinderpest and pest des petite ruminants of ruminants and measles of man (Appel et al.",

Virus occurs in nasal and ocular discharges as well as urine and feces (Appel et al. 1981) . Transmission by fomites is likely when conditions are suitable for virus survival, for example, in an underground burrow where the virus would be protected from sunlight, desiccation, and temperature vacillation. Because canine distemper spreads through susceptible populations primarily by direct contact, transmission should be limited by decreased opportunity for contact caused by declining numbers as animals die or are removed from the population.",

A small population of ferrets was discovered in 1964 in South Dakota and studied during the ensuing years. Beginning in 1971, animals from that population were captured for a captive breeding effort by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Only nine animals were available for captive propagation, and four of these were lost to the vaccine-induced canine distemper. Nonetheless, two litters of five each were produced. In each case, four babies were born dead and the fifth died within one or two days despite intensive medical support (Carpenter & Hillman 1979 , Hillman & Carpenter 1983 , Carpenter 1985 .

Shortly after the blackfooted ferret was rediscovered in 1981, the FWS shared with the state of Wyoming responsibility for making decisions necessary for preserving the species. This was done by allowing the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) to become the lead agency in management of the black-footed ferret under authority granted to the Service in the Endangered Species Act of 1973. One of the first actions of the WGFD was to form an interagency Black-footed Ferret Advisory Team (BFAT) to advise the department in decision making regarding research and management of the ferret (Carr 1986 , Thorne 1987 . From the beginning, diseases were recognized by the WGFD and BFAT as a major threat to the ferret colony, and WGFD and BFAT, along with FWS, implemented extensive precautions designed to minimize opportunity for introduction of disease by researchers and managers (Thorne et al. 1985 , Thorne 1987 .",

Domestic ferrets, which have been studied extensively, and, presumably, black-footed ferrets are susceptible to many diseases and parasites (Carpenter & Hillman 1979 , Bernard et al. 1984 ). Unfortunately, there is little that can be done to protect a free-ranging mustelid population, no matter how small, from diseases that occur naturally in their environment. Precautions were taken, however, to minimize the opportunity for introduction of disease by researchers and managers (Thorne et al. 1985) . Biologists were not allowed to take dogs to the study site and were admonished to avoid contact with strange dogs, which might have canine distemper. Domestic ferrets are susceptible to human influenza, and, presumably, black-footed ferrets also are susceptible. Consequently, persons suffering from influenza were asked not to participate in field activities, such as trapping, that might bring them into contact with a ferret and lead to its exposure. In addition, everyone near a trapped ferret was required to wear a surgical mask to prevent accidental exposure by someone unaware he or she was infected with influenza. To reduce further the chance of exposing a ferret to influenza or canine distemper, all participants in the process of handling ferrets washed their hands with chlorhexidine scrub (Nolvosan Scrub, Aveco Co., Fort Dodge, Iowa) and rinsed them with virucidal disinfectant (Nolvosan Solution, Aveco Co.). Chemically immobilized ferrets were given a prophylactic dose of penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine, and a mild antibacterial ointment was placed in their eyes. When ferrets were trapped or immobilized for research, a veterinarian was always required to be present (Thorne et al. 1985 ).",

This generated a great deal of concern about the future of the prairie dog complex, because it was generally believed that epizootic sylvatic plague results in nearly complete extirpation of prairie dogs in affected colonies (Barnes 1982) . Consequently, what may have been the most extensive nonpublic health, nonurban sylvatic plague control effort was enacted; its objective was to preserve the prey base of black-footed ferrets. Approximately 80,000 prairie dog burrows were individually dusted with 5 percent carbaryl to kill flea vectors of sylvatic plague. As expected, there was no black-footed ferret mortality that could be attcibuted to sylvatic plague; indeed, subsequent research showed domestic ferrets and Siberian polecats to be resistant to plague (Williams, unpublished data) . Although the dusting effort did not eliminate sylvatic plague from the prairie dog complex and there were localized areas where prairie dog mortalities were high, expansion of prairie dogs into other areas resulted in S 2 0 percent loss of occupied prairie dog towns by 1986 (Thorne 1987 ; Forrest et al., in press; Thorne & Belitsky, in press).",

During the May meeting, FWS representatives for the first time expressed optimism that money for captive breeding, according to proposals previously submitted by WGFD, would be available in 1986 or 1987. Consequently, it was decided at that meeting to capture ferrets after field biologists completed 1985 population estimates. The fact that search efforts had failed to locate additional ferret colonies was becoming ominous; the ferrets to be captured in the fall of 1985 were to serve as a hedge against a catastrophe befalling the single known colony of ferrets and also to serve as founder animals for a captive breeding effort (Thorne 1987, Thorne & Belitsky, in press ).",

The rationale behind the emergency capture was to attempt to remove unexposed ferrets from the colony for future use as founder animals; if left in the colony, it was expected they would ultimately be exposed to distemper and die. If diseased ferrets were captured, their removal from the colony would reduce the opportunity for transmission to other animals. Although very few ferrets had been located in outlying towns during 1985 summer surveys, the fact that none of the 49 animals that were ear-tagged as juveniles in 1984 had been relocated or captured in the core colony in 1985 (WGFD 1987; Forrest et al., in press) suggested that a few may have dispersed into those outlying towns. Low ferret density in these areas justified a hope that a few might have escaped exposure to canine distemper and would repopulate the core area after the epizootic had run its course (Thorne 1987; Williams et al., in press; Thorne & Belitsky, in press).",

There are 18 wild black-footed ferrets in captivity and they apparently are all that remain of what is now probably North America's most endangered mammal. The canine distemper epizootic in the only known blackfooted ferret colony had devastating effects. The freeranging colony was essentially extirpated. The captive breeding program quickly went from a carefully planned approach with ideally selected, unrelated founder animals to a crisis situation with related animals, a poor sex ratio, and few mature, experienced Thorne breeder males. In addition, there likely will be no opportunity to add to the original 18 animals in the captive In retrospect, it is unfortunate that ferrets were not captured for captive propagation in 1984 when the population reached its peak size. This had been recommended; certainly WGFD and FWS received much criticism for not having done so (Carr 1986 , May 1986 . Although temporary quarters could have been prepared at Sybille in 1984 as was done in 1985, in 1984 there was neither promise nor even a suggestion of short-and long-term funding for a captive propagation effort from either federal, state, or private agencies and organizations. Nor had any offers been made by institutions outside of Wyoming to take ferrets and participate in captive breeding.",

Carrier animals harbor pathogens and provide sources of infection for endangered species, but they are either unaffected, subclinically affected, incubating the disease and shedding the pathogen, or recovered from the infection but transmitting the disease. The Mauritius pink pigeon (Cobmba rnayeri) is threatened with extinction in its native island habitat of Mauritius, and captive propagation is being attempted at several zoos. At the Rio Grande Zoo, Albuquerque, New Mexico, a well-managed, presumably disease-free, flock of domestic pigeons was established because foster rearing appeared to be an ideal solution to a problem encountered when flighty and unpredictable pink pigeons abandoned eggs. However, pink pigeon chicks, hatched by foster pigeons, died suddenly at 5 to 10 days of age. Pigeon herpesvirus was isolated from the dead chicks and was found to be enzootic but undetected in the domestic flock until susceptible pink pigeons were introduced and succumbed to the infection (Snyder et al. 1985) . Latently infected pigeons re-excrete herpesvirus during the reproductive period, thus serving as a source of virus for uninfected young (Vindevogel et al. 1985) . This case demonstrated the potential hazard from exposure of related but geographically isolated species that differ markedly in their susceptibility to a disease that may be innocuous in one species and fatal in another.",

One of the most successful cheetah captive breeding programs has been at Wildlife Safari, Winston, Oregon, where in 1982 and 1983, 18 cheetahs were lost to feline infectious peritonitis (Pfeifer et al. 1983 , Evermann et al. 1983 ). Rarely does this feline coronavirus-induced disease cause high mortality and morbidity rates in any species that are comparable to those that occurred among Wildlife Safari cheetahs. It has been speculated that the epizootic was so extreme because of the monomorphism of the major histocompatibility complex and lack of effective antiviral immune response (O'Brien et al. 1985) . Absence of genetic variability in this species may have robbed it of its natural protection to this coronavirus.",

There were no illusions that vaccinated free-ranging black-footed ferrets would be completely protected from canine distemper; rather, it was hoped that exposure to canine distemper virus vaccine would result in some degree of primary immune response and possibly would mod@ the course of the disease in an individual exposed to the virus. Some endangered species likely can be effectively vaccinated against important diseases, and they should be vaccinated when handled for research or other purposes. Whether or not endangered species should be captured solely for the purpose of vaccination is more contentious, and such a decision should depend upon inherent dangers associated with capture, demonstrated safety and efficacy of the vaccine in question, predicted consequences of the disease, and potential for exposure of members of the endangered species to the disease.",
