When a disease is perceived as dangerous, people are eager to be protected, even if a varying degree of opposition to immunisation as such has always existed. Many historical examples illustrate this fact. For instance, the ravages wrought by poliomyelitis was the main incentive for over 400,000 American children to take part in what was then (1955) the largest clinical trial of a vaccine (Salk\u2019s inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) (Blume and Geesink 2000). Shortly before (1948\u20131951) nearly 14 million people were inoculated with BCG within the International Tuberculosis Campaign, despite debate surrounding the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. However, the willingness to use BCG cannot be separated from the dread of tuberculosis, particularly in the aftermath of the Second World War (Comstock 1994; Bryder 1999).",

Nor is science the answer to all: how many of us would jump out of an airplane without a parachute, despite the fact that no randomised controlled trial has \u201cscientifically\u201d proven the protection conferred by parachutes when falling through space (Gordon et al 2003)!

And yet if one considers the World Heath Organisation (WHO) European objectives regarding vaccine-preventable diseases, even a country like Switzerland has reached only three goals out of eight (see Table 1).\n\n",

In contrast, only a little over 37% would have agreed to be vaccinated against HIV (Ritvo et al 2003), probably because they considered themselves as not exposed and/or because of treatments being available (regardless of their severe side effects, often underestimated or unknown to the larger public), HIV Aids is increasingly regarded as a chronic, non-fatal disease. Another variation on this theme can be seen in France where parents whose children were vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (HBV) during the 1994\u20131998 campaign as well as parents whose children were over 18 years of age in 2003 had a more favourable attitude towards the HBV vaccine than other parents. This can be attributed at least in part to the fact that they were not confronted with the dilemma of vaccinating or not their offspring following a nationwide scare that HBV vaccine caused multiple sclerosis and a variety of autoimmune diseases (Balinska and L\u00e9on 2007).",

For example, the implementation of Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine was very effective in Switzerland precisely because of the scariness of the disease. As a result, Hib incidence was brought down by 80% in less than 3 years (M\u00fchlemann et al. 1996). But the same fear is associated with meningococcal C disease, whereas its extremely low incidence (only 0.5/ 100,000) hardly justifies the introduction of a full-fledged vaccination programme. Yet how can we not develop recommendations for this much demanded vaccine and how can a physician refuse its administration to the child of anxious parents, especially if the main reason is that the vaccine is \u201ctoo expensive\u201d? This type of situation raises above all ethical issues. In Switzerland, for example, paediatricians confirmed having administrated meningococcal C vaccine to their own children while not being in a position to offer it to their patients (Postfay-Barbe et al. 2005).",

The question may be raised as to what will occur 20 to 30 years hence if we are effective in introducing human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) immunisation programmes. It is perfectly reasonable to predict that it will be increasingly difficult to convince parents to have their adolescent girl immunised against cervical cancer, a disease which will have vanished, if not disappeared.",

Although rotavirus constitutes an important disease burden throughout the world (with high mortality in developing countries), the actual number of ensuing deaths is negligible in privileged countries where access to medical care is as rapid as in Switzerland. Nevertheless, the REVEAL study has estimated that 23.6 million children in the European Union are effected by rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) every year, resulting in some 231 deaths, over 87,000 hospitalisations, and about 700,000 outpatient visits. Seasonal peaks of RVGE are an important cause of hospitalisation for small children, incurring heavy direct medical costs; thus, the introduction of an effective immunisation programme could greatly decrease both distress and costs (Gabutti et al. 2007).",

In spring 2003, an outbreak of measles in Switzerland resulted in 671 cases, leading to 15% of complications, including 4 cases of encephalitis. In 2007, more than 1,000 measles cases were again reported in an outbreak that lasted for more than a year (Richard and Spicher 2007) and is still ongoing with more than 2,300 reported cases by March 2008. Switzerland is hardly an exception: measles outbreaks have been reported in the Netherlands (1999\u20132000, 3,292 reported cases in which 94% of the patients had not been vaccinated) (Van den Hof et al 2002), in Campania, southern Italy, (2002\u20132003, some 20,000 cases with more than 5,000 associated hospitalisations) (Filia 2007), France (2003, 89 cases in Marseilles with a shift to older persons) (Zandotti et al. 2004), and Germany (2003: 246 reported cases in the western part of the country with 52 hospitalisations) (Eurosurveillance Editorial Team 2006). Reasons for insufficient coverage may range from fear of adverse events (such as in the UK) to problems of accessibility (such as in southern Italy) or to a preference for \u201cnatural\u201d medicine (the Netherlands, northeastern Switzerland, and southeastern France). And once again, we face not only an epidemiological problem, but an ethical dilemma, for as one author rightly put it: \u201cunvaccinated clusters pose a risk to themselves and to surrounding vaccine-accepting individuals\u201d (Van den Hof et al 2002). In addition, as time has shown, the use of effective vaccines reduces disease burden and thus the fear of those diseases.",

Besides specific vaccine \u201cpanics\u201d, such as HBV vaccine and multiple sclerosis in France, or Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism in the UK (spreading to other English-speaking countries), there is more and more talk about the possible relation between vaccines and various worrying conditions or concepts, most of which have been refuted or shown to be highly improbable on the basis of available scientific evidence. These fears include vaccines and \u201cimmune overload\u201d (Gregson and Edeman 2003; Offit et al. 2002), vaccines and allergies (Sanchez-Solis and Garcia-Marcos 2006; Koppen et al. 2004), vaccines and autoimmune diseases (Mikaeloff et al. 2007a, b), not to mention suspicions raised over adjuvants (such as mercury and aluminium) (Goriely and Goldman 2007; Siegrist 2007; Davies et al. 2002; Wolfe et al. 2002; Zimmerman et al. 2005) or AIDS (Elswood and Stricker 1994) and cancer. The more recent \u201cepidemic\u201d of obesity in children has also been related to vaccines. And yet the fact remains that the risk of severe adverse events with current vaccines is estimated at 1 to 10 per million. These include anaphylaxis (0.5/million), vaccine-attributed paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) due to oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) (1.3/million), and acute demyelinating encephalopathy (1/million?) (Chen 1996). It has thus become clear that the public perception of vaccines challenges the health of the population at large.",

By computing the use of medical resources one can monitor an entire range of illnesses affecting the target population, which remains beyond the reach of cohort studies. A more difficult challenge is how we, health professionals, should explain relatively complex notions such as time and space clustering, temporal associations - not to mention the difference between adverse events following vaccination (which may or may not be linked to the vaccine), and vaccine adverse effects (recognised undesirable effects usually affecting a very small minority of individuals). These questions are all the more crucial since a number of chronic diseases are on the rise for reasons unknown to us (diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, etc.).

But there are also groups who are more exposed to diseases than others: for example, health-care workers (here again one can cite the examples of hepatitis B and influenza viruses), occupational risks (teachers, social workers, and tuberculosis), or people travelling from a specific disease-free country to a country where that disease is prevalent (for example, yellow fever).",

This third scenario raises important ethical issues: if no official recommendations exist for these vaccines, parents will have at best partial information and, more likely, none. It follows that all effective and safe vaccines should benefit from specific evidence-based recommendations in order to ensure the right to information even in the absence of public health benefit - and even if the recommendation is that a vaccine is not \u201cworth\u201d administering to every one. Efforts should equally be made to ensure equitable access to prevention (principally through reimbursement schemes). However, simply to add such vaccines to routinely recommended vaccines that confer both public health and individual benefit carries the risk of seeing parents select vaccines based on the perceived risks of disease. In such a scenario, measles and pertussis vaccines would continue to rank after group C meningococcus vaccines, despite the evidence.",

In Switzerland, a survey showed in 2004 that 43% of paediatricians based their decision to vaccinate on their own judgement rather than on official recommendations.

The principle and advantage of InfoVac is that it provides direct information to HCW by an independent network of immunisation specialists. It is supported and financed by the Federal Office of Public Health, the Swiss Paediatric Society, the Swiss Society of Infectious Diseases, and the Swiss Society of Allergology and Immunology. InfoVac runs an up-to-date website (www.infovac.ch), which has become a recognised direct source of validated information on vaccine-related issues. Physicians faced with a problem or question regarding immunisation or a specific vaccine can contact InfoVac and are guaranteed an answer from a recognized specialist in vaccinology within 24 to 48 h. InfoVac is appreciated notably thanks to its newsletters to which health-care professionals can subscribe. Information includes newly licensed vaccines, new recommendations, updated epidemiological information (from the Federal Office of Public Health), and product information regarding availability, stock, and batch recalls. The network receives over 2,500 questions per year, around 10% of which concern vaccine safety or adverse events (Cohen and Siegrist 2006). InfoVac also conducts literature reviews on vaccine-related issues and publishes the responses to the most interesting questions it has received during the previous month. A small survey indicating that Swiss paediatricians \u201cfollow their own judgement\u201d also revealed that 77% of them relied on InfoVac for the information they need concerning immunisation (Fig. 1). This is a much better score than that reached by official bodies, reflecting greater peer-based than authority-based confidence and suggesting that InfoVac is a model that might be usefully exported to other countries.\n\n",
