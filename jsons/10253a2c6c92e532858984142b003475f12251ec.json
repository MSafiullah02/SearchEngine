From a philosophical perspective, in the contemporary security discussion the \"dual moment of prevention and compensation of genuinely social and technical uncertainties\" (Makropoulos 1995: 745-750) becomes decisive. These new uncertainties are no manifest or latent dangers emerging from individuals and societal groups that can be prevented by police and political measures but 'societal risks'. This implies that security is no longer a situation free of dangers, but rather an 'insurance' as a 'technology of risks' becomes a disposition of the social steering of modern societies. With the shift of focus from protection against concrete dangers towards insurance in the context of abstract risks, security has become \"a general 'societal idea of value' (Wertidee) and a universally employed 'normative concept', that is used with different meanings in an affirmative manner\" (Makropoulos 1995: 749) .",

As a social science concept, \"security is ambiguous and elastic in its meaning\" (Art 1993: 820-22) . Wolfers (1962) pointed to two sides of the security concept: \"Secu-rity, in an objective sense, measures the absence of threats to acquired values, in a subjective sense, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked\". From the perspective of social constructivist approaches in international relations (Adler 1997; Fearon/Wendt 2002; Risse 2003; Wendt 1992 Wendt , 1999 'security' is conceived as an outcome of a process of social and political interaction where social values and norms, collective identities and cultural traditions are essential. From this perspective, security is always intersubjective or \"security is what actors make of it\" (Wendt 1992) .",

From a realist perspective, objective security is achieved when the dangers posed by manifold threats, challenges, vulnerabilities and risks are avoided, prevented, managed, coped with, mitigated and adapted to by individuals, societal groups, the state or regional or global international organizations. From a social constructivist approach, security is achieved once the perception and fears of security 'threats', 'challenges', 'vulnerabilities' and 'risks' are allayed and overcome. While objective factors in the security perception are necessary, they are not sufficient. Subjective factors influence security perceptions. The perception of security dangers depends on the worldviews or traditions of the analyst (Bull 1977 , Wight 1991 ) and on the mind-set of policymakers (Booth 1979 (Booth , 1987 ) that have often distorted the assessment of 'new challenges' and that \"freeze international relations into crude images, portray its processes as mechanistic responses of power and characterize other nations as stereotypes\" (Booth 1987: 44; 1998: 28) . Influenced by these worldviews and mind-sets, security is a concept of s (Buzan/ Hansen 2009) and of peace and conflict research (Albrecht/Brauch 2008 , 2009 .",

The answers to the questions of security for whom, from whom, by whom, of what values, from what threats and by what means differ fundamentally between both concepts. On the background of the observed widening, deepening and sectorialization of the security concept, this chapter reviews four objective security dangers and subjective security concerns often referred to as security 'threats' (2.2.), 'challenges' (2.3), 'vulnerabilities' (2.4) and 'risks' (2.5), and the use of these basic concepts in different scientific research communities, especially those working on global environmental change, climate change, as well as hazards and disasters. It discusses the relevance of these four concepts for the 'environmental' security dimension (2.6) and for 'human security' (2.7) approaches. The goal of this chapter is to enhance synergies and to mainstream related efforts to strengthen proactive policy initiatives (2.8).",

The state's territory \"can be threatened by seizure or damage, and the threats can come from within and outside of the state\". For Buzan different components of the state are vulnerable to different types of threats where strong states are primarily threatened by outside forces while weak states may be challenged both from within and outside. From a national security perspective, Buzan (1983: 75-83) distinguished between military threats (seizure of territory, invasion, occupation, change of government, manipulation of policy), economic threats (export practices, import restrictions, price manipulations, default on debt, currency controls etc., and those to domestic stability), and ecological threats (damaging the physical base of the state). These threats, Buzan (1983: 88) argued, \"define [the state's] insecurity, and set the agenda for national security as a security problem\". These threats require to understand the state's vulnerabilities. Weapons development as a combination of capabilities and intentions has been semi-independent from threats. Dealing with specific threats, an international security strategy focuses on \"the sources and causes of threats, the purpose being not to block or offset the threats, but to reduce or eliminate them by political action\" (Buzan 1983: 218) .",

Irrespective of the application of this concept to environmental problems, this author suggested to limit the threat concept to hardware related military problems, and to describe dangers posed by the environment as \"environmental security challenges, vulnerabilities and risks\" (Brauch 2005a (Brauch , 2008a . However, in political practice, e.g. in the US national security strategy papers (see chap. 12 by Brauch below); this suggestion could not be observed.",

The official German document suggested that \"risk analysis of future developments must be based on a broad concept of security \u2026 They must include social economic and ecological trends and view them in relation to the security of Germany and its allies.\" 3 In the United States, several national security strategy papers of the Clinton administration have pointed to the fundamental change in security threats (Matthew/Mc Donald 2009) . The administration of George W. Bush in its Quadrennial Defense Review Report (QDR) of 30 September 2001 announced: \"to shift the basis of defence planning from a 'threatbased' model that has dominated thinking in the past to a 'capabilities-based' model in the future [that] \u2026 focuses more on how an adversary might fight rather than specifically who the adversary might be or where a war might occur\" (Brauch 2003b, chap. 12 by Brauch) . The first QDR of the Obama Administration of 1 February 2010 referred to \"Climate change and energy [as] two key issues \u2026 in shaping the future security environment\". It further acknowledged that climate change could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile governments. Climate change will contribute to food and water scarcity, will increase the spread of disease, and may spur or exacerbate mass migration. While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world. In addition, extreme weather events may lead to increased demands for defense support to civil authorities for humanitarian assistance or disaster response both within the United States and overseas. \u2026 DoD has undertaken environmental security cooperative initiatives with foreign militaries that represent a nonthreatening way of building trust, sharing best practices on installations management and operations, and developing response capacity (DoD 2010: 85) .",

She referred to many non-military, non-intentional threats, such as: greenhouse effect, depletion of ozone, badly-handled migration, ageing of the population, and an energy crisis as well as the \u2026 case of a nuclear accident. \u2026The lesson is that many aspects of life in the EU which do fall within the Union's competence but are not normally thought of as security matters are indeed highly relevant to the survival and welfare of our populations, and the more so precisely because of the high level of development and interdependence we have attained. The \u2026 harmonized approaches \u2026 should \u2026 be extended \u2026 to deal e.g. with climatic damage (drought, heat, storm and flood), major cases of pollution, and the interruption of any type of energy supplies.",

Security challenges may refer to less urgent and sometimes non-violent soft security problems, such as migration, human and drug trafficking. These issues are less on the external and primarily on the internal security agenda, and thus a topic for the home and justice ministries and agencies, such as national and international police organizations and of the courts but also of non-governmental societal groups. Migration may be a consequence of domestic conflicts emerging from environmental degradation and resource depletion but it will remain difficult to distinguish push and pull factors.",

            "text": "The vulnerability concept is defined in encyclopaedias in the geosciences where the referent object of 'vulnerability' are both human beings, especially children, and the environment. The vulnerability concept is used in the global change literature (Steffen/Sanderson/Tyson/J\u00e4ger/Matson/Moore III/Oldfield/Richardson/Schellnhuber/Turner/Wasson 2004), on climate change impacts (IPCC 2001a (IPCC , 2007a and in the disaster community (ISDR 2004) . Vulnerability results from \"poverty, exclusion, marginalization and inequities in material consumption\", and it is generated by \"social, economic and political processes\" (Barnett 2001: 132-133) . In the context of the precautionary principle O'Riordan (2002: 369) defined vulnerability at the societal level as: \"the incapacity to avoid danger, or to be uninformed of impending threat, or to be so politically powerless and poor as to be forced to live in conditions of danger\". For Oliver-Smith (2004: 10) \"vulnerability is fundamentally a political ecological concept\". As a theoretical framework \"vulnerability can become a key concept in translating that multi-disciplinarity into the concrete circumstances of life that account for a disaster\". He argues that disasters \"are channelled and distributed in the form of risk within society to political, social and economic practices and institutions\". Wilches-Chaux (1989 : 20-41, 1993 identified 11 types of vulnerability, \"natural, physical, economic, social, political, technical, ideological, cultural, educational, ecological and institutional vulnerability\". For Oliver-Smith (2004: 11) \"vulnerability is conceptually located at the interaction of nature and culture\" that also links \"social and economic structures, cultural norms and values and environmental hazards\". He discussed four questions: 1) the \"general contributions of the cultural construction of nature to the social production of disaster\"; 2) \"how the political and economic forms and conditions that characterize vulnerability are inscribed in an environment\"; 3) \"the relationship between cultural interpretation and the material world of risk, threat and impact of disasters\"; and 4) \"how do we theorize the linkages among these three issues, particularly in the context of current patterns of globalization\". Nathan (2009: 1125) pointed to a dual vulnerability: on the one side \u2026 a tendency to undergo damages, i.e. a state of fragility, or a set of conditions, that raise the susceptibility of a community to the impact of a damaging phenomenon. On the other side, vulnerability is an incapacity to anticipate, cope with, resist to, adapt to and recover from hazards. Vulnerable units are either not resistant, i.e. not capable to withstand the shock (without adapting); and/or not resilient, i.e. not capable to absorb the shock and adapt to come back to an acceptable state. Nathan (2009: 1125) characterized vulnerability \"as a complex process encompassing multiple intricate dimensions\" that is constantly changing. In his view vulnerability is: often cumulative, causing disasters that in turn aggravate it, or adding to vulnerabilities to other risks (such as socio-economical risks, etc.). Furthermore, vulnerability is both hazard-related \u2026 and subject-related. \u2026 Therefore, one has to specify which vulnerability one is talking about, and at which level of analysis (individual, group, society). \u2026 Vulnerability is also highly differentiated: different subjects, even at the same 'level', have different vulnerabilities. \u2026 Generally, the most miserable and isolated suffer most, as well as the less organized. \u2026 Vulnerability is context-dependent, be it an individual exposed to natural hazards at the household level, or mankind at a global level. These 'transversal' features of global vulnerability apply to each component of vulnerability (Nathan 2009: 1125).",

While impact assessment offers little guidance among the many environmental stresses, vulnerability assessment offers a maturing strategy to provide such guidance. Vulnerability to global environmental change has been conceptualized as the risk of adverse outcomes to receptors or exposure units (human groups, ecosystems and communities) in the face of relevant changes in climate, other environmental variables, and social conditions. \u2026 Vulnerability is emerging as a multi-dimensional concept involving at least exposure -the degree to which a human group or ecosystem comes into contact with particular stresses; sensitivity -the degree to which an exposure unit is affected by exposure to any set of stresses; and resilience -the ability of the exposure unit to resist or recover from the damage associated with the convergence of multiple stresses. \u2026 Vulnerability can increase through cumulative events or when multiple stresses weaken the ability of a human group or ecosystem to buffer itself against future adverse events, often through the reduction in coping resources and adaptive capacities (Steffen/Sanderson/Tyson/J\u00e4ger/Matson/Moore III/Oldfield/Richardson/Schellnhuber/Turner/Wasson 2004: 205). Steffen et al. (2004) point to the scale-and space-dependent property of systems and thus differ on the local, regional and global level. Complex vulnerability analyses can address \"multiple causes of critical outcomes rather than only the multiple outcomes of a single event\". Thus, scenario development becomes a crucial element of vulnerability analysis. An important precondition for the quantification of vulnerability parameters could be vulnerability indicators. Along these lines, Comfort, Wisner, Cutter, Pulwarty, Hewitt, Oliver-Smith, Wiener, Fordham, Peacock and Krimgold (1999) developed a \"standardized all-hazards vulnerability index\". Others have suggested an Index of Human Insecurity (Lonergan/Gustavson/ Carter 2000). Steffen et al. (2004: 209) admit that the current status of vulnerability research and assessment \"exhibit both a potential for substantial synergy in addressing global environmental risks \u2026 as well as significant weaknesses which undermine the potential\". A major driver of GEC has been climate change where the 'vulnerability' concept has been extensively discussed.",

While human vulnerability has been extensively researched (Burton/Kates/White 1993; Mitchell 1989 Mitchell , 1990 ; Emel/Peer 1989; Watts/Bohle 1993; Adger 1999) they proposed to move \"from a state of human vulnerability to one of human security\" (Bohle 2001; Twigg/ Bhatt 1998; O'Brien/Vogel 2004) . Earlier Bohle (2001) had pointed to the \"double structure of vulnerability\" linking external or environmental with internal or social vulnerability. While the external side (structure) of vulnerability refers to exposure to social and environmental stressors, the internal side (agency) points to the policy response or the capacity to mitigate, cope with, recover from, and adapt to stressors with the goal to achieve human security. While the 'structure' is influenced by the ecological and geographic context, the 'agency' depends on the institutional context and both rely on the distribution of rights and resources as well as on the control over and access to assets. For the analysis of the linkages between human vulnerability and security they suggest research on four interrelated drivers \"control of and access to assets, institutional factors, distribution of rights and resources, and ecological and geographic conditions\" (Brklacich/Chazan/Bohle 2010: 42).

They concluded arguing that Movement along the continuum from vulnerability to security is most likely influenced by context-specific, sure to threats, capacity for response, and socio-environmental drivers. This contextual nature of vulnerability supports trends towards micro-level approaches to vul-In analysing the linkages between environmental change and violent conflict, Barnett and Adger (2010: 120) listed among the factors affecting violent conflicts besides poverty, migration, and weak states also 'vulnerable livelihoods' that directly influence water, agricultural productivity, the frequency and intensity of extreme events and the distribution of diseases. \"These affect livelihoods by exposing people to risks, thereby increasing their vulnerability. The impacts are more significant in sectors of the population with high resource-dependency, and located in more environmentally and socially marginalized areas.\" Barnett, Matthew and O'Brien (2010a: 308ff.) pointed to several areas of future research on GEC, vulnerability and human security, such as 1) social causes of vulnerability (including gender differentiations) to environmental change; 2) the mediating role of perceptions between GEC and policy responses and the roles of values, beliefs and worldviews, 3) the interface of GEC and human health, 4) shift to peace-ful responses to the linkage of GEC and human security (e.g. environmental peacemaking), 5) the impacts of violent conflict on human security and vulnerability to environmental change, 6) need for more consideration to linkages among human rights, human security and GEC, and 7) to reflect on the coping capabilities and resilience of the affected people.",

In The Regional Impacts of Climate Change: An Assessment of Vulnerability, the IPCC (1998) explores potential consequences of climate change for ten regions based on \"assessing sensitivities and vulnerabilities of each region, rather than attempting to provide quantitative predictions of the impacts of climate change\", i.e. to assess \"the extent to which climate change may damage or harm a system\" taking into account the sensitivity of the region to climate and the adaptive ability. The report tries to explain: \"how projected changes in climate could interact with other environmental changes (e.g. biodiversity loss, land degradation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and degradation of water resources) and social trends (e.g. population growth, economic development and technological progress\" (IPCC 1998: ix) . It calls for more research on \"interlinkages among environmental issues\". This IPCC report assessed the vulnerability of natural and social systems of major regions to climate change with qualitative methods.

The Technical Summary of the AR4 also points to the link with \"systemic thresholds where non-linear processes cause a system to shift from one major state to another\". Besides these potential 'tipping points' of the climate system (Lenton/Held/Kriegler/Hall/ Lucht/Ramstorf/Schellnhuber 2008) key vulnerabilities may be linked to \"'normative thresholds' defined by stakeholders or decision-makers (e.g. a magnitude of sea-level rise no longer considered acceptable by low-lying coastal dwellers\" (IPCC 2007a: 73) . AR4 argues that \"some key vulnerabilities have been associated with observed climate change\", such as \"increases in human mortality during extreme weather events, and increasing problems associated with permafrost melting, glacier retreat and sea-level rise\". AR4 distinguished among three different climate change regimes associated with a global mean temperature increase of up to 2\u00b0C, between 2 to 4\u00b0C, and above 4\u00b0C until the end of the 21 st century. 8 With regard to security risks posed by climate change, the WBGU (2008: 242) defined vulnerability as \"the susceptibility of a social group or (environmental) system to crises and pressures\" by distinguishing between social and biophysical vulnerability. The report of the UN Secretary-General on \"Climate change and its possible security implications\" (UN-SG 2009: 1) approached this linkage \"from a perspective of interdependence between human vulnerability and national security\" and it identified 'vulnerability' among the five channels through which climate change could affect security, arguing that \"Climate change threatens food security and human health, and increases human exposure to extreme events,\" especially for the poor countries that \"are among the most vulnerable, and the best way to reduce their vulnerability is to help lift them out of poverty\". The use of the vulnerability concept by the climate community 7 There is an extensive literature on the vulnerability concept as used by the climate change community, see e.g. F\u00fcssel (2007) offers an overview of the key vulnerabilities of the global social, regional, biological and geophysical systems as well as of the risks from extreme events for global average temperature changes from 0\u00b0C up to 5\u00b0C above 1990.",

This interpretation of vulnerability is unavoidably related to resilience, the ability to return to a state similar to the one prevailing prior to the disaster. Thus, vulnerability is not only ill-defined, but its manifestation and magnitude depend on many partially unknown factors and their coincidence. Plate (2002) recommended a critical index of vulnerability measured as the distance between the part of the GNP per person needed for maintaining minimum social standards and the available GNP per person. This index would focus on the financial resources available within a society or a community, or even an individual household that can reduce the effect of a disaster. This vulnerability measure would cover only some problems, while the environmental dimension cannot adequately be expressed in monetary terms.",

The selection and inclusion of these contributing factors is configured by the worldview, mind-set, perception, the theories and models of the analyst.

Thus, insecurity cannot be measured and cannot be insured against, while risks may be insured against.

In psychology 'risk' (St\u00e4dtler 2003: 937-938 ) is used in decision-making theories, especially for decision situations taken under risk, synonymously for decision and decision behaviour. Risk implies that individuals show in decisions variance preferences that do not always follow the principle of maximizing benefits, but also reflect the relationship between maximum gain and loss. The portfolio theory of risks by Coombs (1975) implies a preference function for risks where the optimal value of risk is to find a balance between greed, challenge and fear.

With his theory of a 'risk society', Beck tried to place the problem of risk in the context of a theory of modernity focusing primarily on technical dangers and less on social action. Bon\u00df (1995: 18-19) suggested to broaden the sociological risk debates in two respects: 1) the linkage between risk and technology must be dissolved and it should be analysed as a problem of insecurity; and 2) from a historical perspective the treatment of uncertainty should be reconstructed. He offered a systematic history of the discourse on the risk concept as a social and cultural construct with a special focus on the transition from a reactive towards an active orientation of insecurity. Among several classifications of risk concepts Bon\u00df pointed to two alternatives to analyse risk as a social phenomenon from an action (ex ante) or systems (ex post) perspective. From an action perspective, risks are reduced to risk decisions, while from a systems perspective risks are treated as threats or danger of loss. Bon\u00df suggests analysing risks in the context of the social construction of uncertainties. While uncertainties due to dangers exist irrespective of human actions, uncertainties as risks include both the intentions and implementation of action. Thus, risks are often the result of decisions made under uncertainty.",

Giddens stresses the importance of the environment, war and personal relationships in modern experiences and construction of risk. In so doing, Giddens makes plain that 'risk is not just a major individual action. There are environments of risk that collectively affect masses of individuals'\".",

Risk has always been constitutive of the conditio humana. However, the nature of risks has changed, while they were originally local in impact, today many risks are eco-centric (i.e. they are linked to environmental problems or related to environmental conditions), and global. They are increasingly perceived as common risks, be it as systematic cumulative environmental risks, often affecting the globe as a whole (e.g. climate change), and the increasing risk consciousness of high technology. With the adoption of 'risk' as the imprimatur of our age, as suggested by Beck and Giddens, the direction of Western thought has shifted from \"the expectation of progress, of continued improvement in the social world\" to an epoch \"in which the dark sides of progress increasingly come to dominate social debate\", shifting from the 'goods' of modernization to the often unintended 'bads' (Jaeger/Renn/Rosa/Webler 2001: 15).",

The competition on the division of resources has partly been replaced by the management of these global risks of survival. They require a reflexive modernization where prevailing views, values, norms, conventions and behavioural patterns are an object of sociological reflection (Hillmann 1994) . Ulrich Beck (1999: 3-4) defined 'risk' as the modern approach to foresee and control the future consequences of human action, the various unintended consequences of radicalized modernization.

Actors do this through cognitive and behavioural routines; and because the resulting routines stabilize the self, actors become attached to them\". Based on Huymans (1998) and Mc Sweeney (1999), Mitzen (2005) argues that states also need ontological security and she proposes \"that states achieve ontological security by routinizing relations with other states and apply that argument to entrenched interstate conflict. This reveals another, second 'security dilemma' in international politics: ontological security can impede physical security\". If states try to break out of security dilemmas, Mitzen (2005: 3-4) argues that this could \"generate ontological insecurity\". Thus, \"parties may prefer to remain in security dilemmas, even if offered credible opportunities for escape. In short, ontological security turns security dilemma logic on its head, suggesting that the persistence of conflict is rooted not in uncertainty but in the certainty such dilemmas offer their participants\".",

Z\u00fcrn (1995: 51) saw an essential difference between environmental destruction as a result of wellbeing and poverty: \"Whereas many wealth-driven ecological threats stem from the externalization of production costs, in the case of the poverty-driven ecological destruction it is the poor who destroy themselves with side-effects for the rich.\" Thus, wealth-driven environmental destruction becomes international only through side-effects in the medium term. Beck (1999: 36) argued that ecological destruction may promote war either as an outgrowth of resource scarcity (water) or because Western eco-fundamentalists use force to stop ongoing destruction. Such ecological destruction may trigger mass emigration which may lead to war. This may result in a spiral of destruction where different crisis phenomena converge. In the world risk society, these 'global threats' have together led to a world where the basis of established risk-logic has whittled away, and where hard to manage dangers prevail instead of quantifiable risks. The new dangers are removing the conventional pillars of safety calculation. Damage loses its spatio-temporal limits and becomes global and lasting. It is hardly possible any more to blame definite individuals for such damage. \u2026 Often, too, financial compensation cannot be awarded for the damage done; it has no meaning to insure oneself against the worst-case effects of spiralling global threats (Beck 1999: 36).",

Daase (2002: 9-35) argued that these new dangers require a paradigmatic change in security policy from defence against threats to crisis prevention. He distinguished between risks due to transformation and globalization and new political and international risks. Since 1990, the traditional threat triangle of an actor, his intentions and capabilities, has been replaced with different dangers that are often indirect, non-intended and uncertain. The fundamental difference between security threats and risks, in his view, has been that the certainty of expectation has disappeared with the departure of a clearly defined threat. Instead of reacting to perceived security threats, a proactive security policy should focus on the prevention of the causes and effects of risks. This would lead to four ideal-type strategies of international risk policy that may be described as cooperation, intervention, compensation and preparation to contain risks.",

From an environmental perspective, Kasperson and Kasperson (2001: 1) tried to combine all four basic concepts: \"global environmental risk is about threat; it is also about opportunity\". The goal of their book is to take stock of \"distinctive challenges posed by global environmental risks, the ability of the knowledge system to identify and characterize such threats, and the capability of societies to address the management of challenges\" (emphasis added). They distinguish between systemic risks (e.g. of global warming) and cumulative environmental change that may cause both short-and long-term consequences. They used risk synonymously with hazard, referring to \"human beings and what they value\". For them, global environmental risk \"refers to threats \u2026 resulting from human-induced environmental change, either systemic or cumulative, on the global scale\". They focus on five themes: 1) Global environment risk is the ultimate threat. 2) Uncertainty is a persistent feature both of understanding process and causation as well as predicting outcomes. 3) Global environment risk manifests itself in different ways at different spatial scale. 4) Vulnerability is a function of variability and distribution in physical and socio-economic systems, the limited human ability to cope with additional and sometimes accumulating hazard, and the social and economic constraints that limit these abilities. 5) Futures are not given, they must be negotiated.",

They refer to five risk sources: a) disputes arising from human-induced local environmental degradation; b) ethnic clashes arising from population migration and deepened social cleavage due to environmental scarcity; c) civil strife caused by environmental scarcity that affects economic productivity and, in turn, people's livelihoods, elite groups, and the ability of states to meet changing demands; d) scarcity-induced interstate war over, for example, water 19 ; and e) North-South conflicts over mitigation of, adaptation to, and compensation for global environmental problems (Homer-Dixon 1999: 5). On the environmental security debate they admit \"that such frameworks and models remain very limited in providing satisfactory interpretations\" and that \"causal linkages between environmental change and attributes of environmental security are yet poorly defined and understood\". Kasperson, Kasperson, Turner, Dow and Meyer (1995: 5-8) distinguished between geocentric and anthropocentric approaches to the study of environmental criticality which they defined as \"a state of both environmental degradation and associated socioeconomic deterioration\". A critical region refers to \"an area that has reached such a state of interactive degradation\". The geocentric approach defines criticality \"in terms of changes in physical attributes or social dimensions\" due to human-induced perturbations that have altered the biophysical system. While the geocentric approach focuses purely on the physical envi-ronment, the anthropocentric perspective focuses solely on human inhabitants. Therefore, the authors suggest an integrative, holistic approach to the criticality of environmental threats which they describe with the conflicting terms -sensitivity, resistance, resilience, marginality, fragility, and vulnerability. Any analysis of criticality requires an assessment of what and who is threatened by environmental degradation. From the literature and their discussion they drew several lessons for the study of 'environmental criticality' of relevance for a regional approach:",

Criticality refers to situations where emerging environmental degradation may lead to a loss of a capability to survive. The 'critical region' concept does not adequately capture the identifiable situations, rather additional categories are needed. A lot of the change inflicted by human pressures on the environment may impose costs on future generations that must be included in approaches to endangerment and criticality. But many of the currently perceived environmental threats may disappear in the near future. These authors differentiate \"criticality\" from lesser degrees of environmental threats such as environmental endangerment and impoverishment. The 'critical regions' are characterized by environmental degradation (water, air, soil, biomass productivity), wealth (GNP, income, savings), well-being (longevity, mortality, infant mortality, nutrition, environmentally induced disease) and economic and technological substitutability (cash-crop dependency, technological monocultures, innovation, economic diversity). Before a region reaches a status of environmental criticality, many warning signals alert experts and the society to impending or recurring damage. The degree of response depends largely on the political and societal sensitivity but also on the resources available to cope with these challenges.",

Slovic (2000) summarized the results of a research team that examined \"the gap between expert views of risk and public perceptions\", how these perceptions have evolved and changed over time, increasingly recognizing \"the importance and legitimacy of equity, trust, power and other value-laden issues underlying public concern\". They described \"new methods for assessing perceptions of risk\" and they discussed \"the implications for regulation and public policy\". In a follow-up study Pidgeon, Kasperson and Slovic (2003) analysed \"how both social and individual factors act to amplify or dampen perceptions of risk and through this created secondary effects such as stigmatization of technologies, economic losses, or regulatory impacts\". They focus on \"risk perception and communication\" and draw lessons \"for public policy, risk management, and risk communication practice\". Posner (2004) offers an interdisciplinary perspective that combines the insights of a lawyer, a social and physical scientist in weighing risks and possible responses to a major catastrophe such as global warming, bioterrorism or a major accident. He argues that the risks of global catastrophe have grown due to the technological advance and industrial applications, the growth of the world economy and population, and the rise of apocalyptic global terrorism that are often underestimated due to low probability that they may happen in the near future. However, there is a difference in public attention and response between creeping natural disasters (climate change) and intended catastrophes, such as nuclear attacks, bioterrorism, and cyber terrorism that have become an objective of the military and of criminal justice. Posner calls for a mutual rethinking of the liberals \"in the face of technological terrorism\" and of the conservatives on global warming, many of them deny that these global challenges and risks require a global response based on international cooperation.",

Smith 2001)\".

Both approaches from the natural and from the social sciences \"assume that disasters are departures from 'normal' social functioning, and that recovery means a return to normal\". Wisner, Blaikie, Cannon and Davis (2004: 10) do not deny the significance of natural hazards as trigger events, but [their book] puts the main emphasis on the various ways in which social systems operate to generate disasters by making people vulnerable. In the 1970's and early 1980's, the vulnerability approach to disasters began with a rejection of the assumption that disasters are 'caused' in any simple way by external natural events, and a revision of the assumption that disasters are 'normal'. Emel and Peet (1989) , Oliver-Smith (1986) and Hewitt (1983a) review these reflections on causality and 'normality'. A competing vulnerability framework arose from the experience of research in situations where 'normal' daily life was itself difficult to distinguish from disaster.

Within the framework of national security Mathews (1989) and Myers (1989 Myers ( , 1989a argued: \"First there was a need to redefine security and to include a new range of threats. \u2026 Second, there was an acceptance that the object of security was no longer simply the state, but ranges to levels above and below the level of the state\" (Lonergan 2002: 270-271) . Mathews (1989: 162) proposed a \"broadening definition of national security to include resource, environmental and demographic issues\". She warned that global changes \"in the chemical composition of the atmosphere, in the genetic diversity of species inhabiting the planet, and in the cycling of vital chemicals through the oceans, atmosphere, biosphere and geosphere\" could lead to irreversible damage. Myers (1989: 23-41) pointed to several environmental factors (soil erosion, ozone layer, climate change) as legitimate causes for international concern that may have repercussions for US security policy. Myers (1993 Myers ( , 1994 Myers ( , 1996 also claimed that the \"principal threat to security and peace stems from environmental breakdown\" and that environmental problems can \"figure as causes of conflict\", such as water in the Middle East, desertification in the Sahel, water diversion or flooding in Bangladesh. Myers (1993: 20-21) equated security with \"human well-being; not only from harm and injury but access to water, food, shelter, health, employment, and other basic requisites\". He warned if the environmental foundations are depleted: the nation's economy will eventually decline, its social fabric will deteriorate, and its political structure will become destabilized. The outcome is all too likely to be conflict, whether in the form of disorder and insurrection within a nation or tensions and hostilities with other nations. \u2026 National security is no longer about fighting forces and weaponry alone. It relates to watersheds, croplands, forests, genetic resources, climate, and other factors rarely considered by military experts and political leaders, but that taken together deserve to be viewed as equally crucial to a nation's security as military prowess. Myers (1996: 22) analysed as environmental factors contributing to conflict: population growth, ozone layer depletion and global warming, mass extinction of species and as a direct consequence: environmental refugees. These 'Neo-Malthusian' (Malthus 1789 (Malthus [1993 ) and 'realist' concerns that focused on the 'state' as the major referent object had a conceptual impact on the US defence and security policy during the Clinton administration but they were discontinued by his successor (Matthew/McDonald 2009).",

On rapid urbanization, Ruggie (1998: 163) emphasized that social turmoil may result from the \"insufficient capacity on the part of the cities to service such large increments of population in so short a time. A social turmoil in turn may provide targets of opportunity, either for domestic forces to internationalize the problem or for foreign forces to meddle in domestic affairs\".

Environmental factors, both rapid-onset hydro-meteorological hazards and creeping challenges posed by global environmental change have increased 'human insecurity' by confronting the highly vulnerable and poor people with a 'survival dilemma' (Brauch 2008b): either to stay at home in their village continuing their traditional livelihood, or to move first to the next major urban centre. The young and those who can afford it have of course a third possibility: to move to a country or a region that offers them better economic conditions and future prospects for survival of their family. Hazard-induced or environmentally triggered distress migration has become a major 'human' and 'societal' security challenge for the 21 st century. In Europe, in the US, but also in India, the counter strategies have been similar in tightening border controls.

Thus a dual strategy is needed for dealing with: short-term situational impacts of extreme weather events and natural hazards; and longer-term structural impacts of global environmental change. While the global environmental change, the climate change and the hazard research communities have used different concepts of environmental, social and economic vulnerabilities and risks, a conceptual and a policy-oriented mainstreaming is needed to address both impacts. Three groups of vulnerability and risk indicators are needed: for both climate change and hydro-meteorological hazards; for specific hazards (storms, floods, drought), and for temperature increase and sea-level rise. Thus, effective climate policies with legally binding obligations may be the most cost-effective solutions to counter the projected increase in extreme weather events. To respond to these complex and manifold environmental security threats, challenges, vulnerabilities, and risks as well as to those posed by manifold hazards, it is primarily proactive non-military policies and measures (table 2.3) which are needed. More conceptual work on the linkages between 'environmental' and 'human' security is necessary, but also between economic production and ecosystems (N. Georgescu-Roegen 1971). Mainstreaming efforts are required on the scientific and political tracks with regard to the environmental dimension of human security (conceptualization in the scientific community); and a 'paradigm shift' in the UN system from 'national' towards 'human security' perspectives.",

They offered \"a formal definition, introducing the term 'tipping element' to describe subsystems of the Earth system that are at least subcontinental in scale and can be switched -under certain circumstances -into a qualitatively different state by small perturbations. The tipping point is the corresponding critical point -in forcing and a feature of the system -at which the future state of the system is qualitatively altered\". They pointed to the melting of the Arctic sea-ice, rapid changes in the Greenland and in the West Antarctic ice sheet, a shutoff of the Gulf Stream (Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation), changes in the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in the Indian summer monsoon, in the Sahara/Sahel and West African monsoon, a drying of the Amazon basin and changes in boreal forests. The potential political and security consequences of these non-linear or chaotic perturbations in the climate system once unknown thresholds have been crossed have not yet been analysed and may only be discussed in the context of worst-case impact scenarios.

GECHS (1999) argued that the following types of environmental change affect human security: a) natural disasters, b) cumulative changes or slow-onset changes, c) accidental disruptions or industrial accidents, d) development projects, and e) conflict and warfare. Barnett (2001: 127) considered a \"human-centred environmental security concept\" as justified on moral and pragmatic grounds \"because addressing the welfare of the most disadvantaged means addressing many of the future sources of environmental degradation\" by protecting the rights of the most vulnerable members of society and by enhancing \"welfare, peace and justice\" on which legitimate institutions should be built which are required \"for human and environmental security\" (Conca 1994 (Conca , 1994a . Najam (2003: 1-24) proposed an environment and security discussion around two sources of insecurity (violent conflict and social eruption), and to focus the analysis on state centred and society centred activities. This leads him to four outcomes: 1) interstate war (state centred violent conflict); 2) civil strife (society centred violent conflict); 3) institutional failure (state centred social disruption); and 4) human insecurity (as a society centred social disruption). Barnett, Matthew and O'Brien (2008) and Matthew, Barnett, Mc Donald and O'Brien (2010, 2010a) offered a glimpse on the work the Global Environmental Change and Human Security (GECHS) project within the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) that has been pursued from 1996 to June 2009 when the project ended with a synthesis conference. Barnett, Matthew and O'Brien (2010: 4) argued that \"global environmental change poses new and in some cases unprecedented threats to human security \u2026 that transcend the North-South binary and the 'rich-poor' dichotomy\" and they discussed \"how a human security orientation to environmental change can contribute to initiatives such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\". In contrast to national or state security, human security \"securitizes \u2026what individuals themselves see as their paramount concerns, and so pluralizes the meaning of security and opens up space for alternative security practices. It adds to the concept of human development \u2026 by focusing on immediate concerns such as basic needs and peace, and by directing attention toward the most vulnerable (Gasper/Truong 2005)\" (Barnett/Matthew/O'Brien 2010: 9). They concluded that \"global environmental change is adding impetus to the realization that traditional understandings of security are limited and are an inadequate basis for making policy\" and that GEC \"is raising new and unavoidable question to equity and sustainability, which already underlie every aspect of human security\". Finally they called \"for greater integration of the security, development, and sustainable development research and policy communities, which have for too long been too distinct\".",

These four pillars of human insecurity pose threats, challenges, vulnerabilities, and risks to different aspects of human security and call for three different but interrelated strategies for coping and overcoming human insecurity for which different national and international organizations and means are needed. All four pillars of human insecurity (want, fear, hazard impact, indignity) also impact on health insecurity. Chen and Narasimhan (2003: 3-12) in their human security agenda for global health argued that three factors: 1) conflicts and humanitarian emergencies; 2) infectious crisis (HIV/AIDS); and 3) impoverishment impact on illness, injury, disability, death posing critical pervasive threats to the vital core of human security: human survival and flourishing; livelihood; and dignity.
