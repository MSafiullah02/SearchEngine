On the 6th illness day, he presented to the emergency department of a community hospital with lethargy and confusion. He was electively intubated for airway protection. His chest X-ray (CXR) was normal. Routine admission laboratory tests including hepatic transaminases were within normal range. A non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any abnormalities (Fig. 1, top row), and he underwent lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 53 WBC/\u03bcl with 91% lymphocytes, 6 RBC/\u03bcl, protein 113 mg/dl, and glucose 59 mg/dl. He was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis and started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily per nasogastric tube). On the morning of the third-day of hospitalization, he experienced tonic-clonic seizures and remained comatose with extensor posturing afterwards. Repeat head CT (Fig. 1, bottom row) demonstrated diffuse brain edema and effaced basal cisterns. He received fosphenytoin, mannitol, and propofol. The treating physicians contacted the neuro-intensive care unit at Kaiser Sacramento for additional assistance.\n",

On arrival, his initial examination demonstrated a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3 (E1V1M1). His repeat CXR did not demonstrate any infiltrates or signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An external ventricular drain was placed by the neurosurgeon at the bedside. He reported that the CSF pressure noted at the time of initial catheter placement was elevated. The first recorded intracranial pressure (ICP) was 10 mm Hg, and this reading was taken after the expected loss of CSF during the procedure. On the second day of NICU hospitalization, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 4 (E1V1M2) and average ICP was 7 mm Hg. Throughout the remainder of the hospitalization, the recorded ICP remained below 20 mm Hg. Initial ICP was maintained with external ventricular drainage at 0 cm relative to the external auditory canal and a midazolam infusion (5 mg/h). Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring demonstrated diffuse, severe slowing in the delta range and no electrographic seizures. On hospital day 3, MRI of the brain was obtained (see Fig. 2). He received 20 days of dual neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (oseltamivir 150 mg twice daily per nasogastric tube, peramavir 600 mg IV daily); intravenous gamma globulin (1 gm/kg \u00d7 2 days); dexamethasone (10 mg IV load, 6 mg IV every 6 h with taper over 4 weeks); ICP monitoring and management; ventilator support; and anticonvulsants (fosphenytoin, levetiracetam). His weekly Glasgow scale scores showed delayed improvement (3, E1V1M1, admission): 5 (E2V1M2, week 1), 5 (E2V1M2, week 2), 5 (E2V1M2, week 3), 9 (E3V2M4, week 4). The midazolam infusion was discontinued on hospital day 4, after clinical observation and EEG confirmation that he was not having electrographic seizures. Thereafter he received intermittent doses of lorazepam as needed for sedation while on the ventilator. Over 3 weeks, neuroimaging demonstrated improvement in his brain edema with restoration of his basal cisterns, and the external ventricular drain was successfully weaned and removed. More rapid weaning of his external ventricular drain was not attempted due to severe neurologic impairments with GCS less than eight and radiographic appearance of diffuse brain edema and effaced basal cisterns.\n",

He did not develop adult respiratory distress syndrome or suffer periods of hypoxemia. RT-PCR of an admission nasopharyngeal swab was positive for 2009 H1N1 virus at the California Department of Public Health Virology Laboratory. RT-PCR analysis of CSF samples was negative for influenza A and B viruses, herpes virus type 1, 2, and 6, varicella, enterovirus, and Epstein Barr virus. Nasopharyngeal samples were negative for enterovirus and mycoplasma PCR. Bacterial and viral cultures of CSF were negative. Test results from clinical specimens (blood, endotracheal aspirate, serum, and CSF) sent to the California Encephalitis Project did not reveal an alternative cause. Follow-up MRI brain imaging (Fig. 2b, d) was repeated at 1 month. After 6 weeks, he transitioned to acute rehabilitation, and 1 month later returned home. Because he had improved upper extremity use without recovery in his legs, the physiatry staff performed spine MR imaging and no specific cause was identified.",

Microglia and astrocytes are capable of producing cytokines in the CNS [13, 14]. It is known that influenza virus infects and replicates at the nasopharyngeal epithelium leading to extensive damage during infection. Below the mucosa, the free nerve endings of the olfactory nerves may also become infected. As seen with Herpes simplex viruses, some postulate that influenza virus could penetrate and replicate at the olfactory mucosa and the free nerve endings with resultant axonal transport of virions to the olfactory bulbs, to the olfactory tract, and finally to the brain [15]. There is some literature to support this mechanism when one looks at H5N1, or avian influenza, where mice inoculated intranasally with H5N1 developed CNS lesions in the pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellar nuclei. Astrocytes and glial cells were positive for viral antigen but viral replication ceased before 7 days [16, 17]. Further study is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of CNS disease complicating influenza A infection.",

Seizures are often present. Initial brain CT may show decreased density in the thalami, and MRI of brain demonstrates the characteristic bilateral thalami lesions. This finding may be initially mistaken for ischemic strokes (top-of-basilar syndrome) or venous infarction secondary to thrombosed internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen, or straight sinus. It is interesting that there have been case reports for recurrent ANE and also familial ANE. This suggests that there may be a genetic susceptibility and a gene associated with familial seasonal influenza ANE cases has been reported (nuclear pore gene, RANBP2; [40]).",

CT and MRI brain imaging were unrevealing. CSF studies detected evidence of the persistence of the NP gene of influenza B virus in the CSF from samples taken 7 and 9 weeks after the onset of initial influenza illness. A 25-year old woman gradually developed gait and speech problems after influenza A illness that was treated with oseltamavir. CSF showed pleocytosis. The cerebellar cortex had increased T2 signal which resolved over an 80 day period. She received pulse intravenous corticosteroid therapy. Her symptoms resolved [42]. Plasmapheresis [45] and IVIG [46] have also been used for this condition. Some cases of cerebellitis following viral and mycoplasma illness have developed fulminant cerebellar swelling with secondary brainstem compression, obstructive hydrocephalus, with fatal outcome [47]. Interventions with posterior fossa decompression and external ventricular drain placement may lead to a favorable outcome in a child with this severe condition. Antibodies to the glutamate receptor have been reported in patients with post-infectious influenza viral cerebellitis [44].",

Treatment for influenza-related GBS is identical to treatment for other GBS due to other associated causes. Monitoring for respiratory compromise due to neuromuscular weakness with timely respiratory support if needed is critical. Plasmapheresis or gammaglobulin treatments are also helpful. The precise pathophysiology is uncertain, but molecular mimicry of the infectious agent is presumed to stimulate autoimmune responses.

A wave of such cases was reported following the 1918\u20131919 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic. The cardinal features of this condition are altered consciousness with prolonged somnolence and ophthalmoplegia. After intervals of months to years, survivors are at risk of developing parkinsonism. Pathological findings include nerve cell destruction primarily in the midbrain, subthalamus, and hypothalamus [53, 54]. Using modern laboratory techniques, formalin-preserved autopsy brain specimens of encephalitis lethargica cases analysed for influenza viral RNA were negative [54]. Scientists have proposed a \u201chit-and-run\u201d model of early viral-mediated injury with late sequelae [54]. The neurologist Oliver Sacks [55] drew attention to this mysterious disorder and the discovery of l-dopa, in his book, Awakenings later converted to a feature-length movie. The delayed appearance of restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia in our patient and others [35] is concerning for this condition (Fig. 2). We do not know if this indicates that our patient with 2009 H1N1 is at risk of developing post-viral parkinsonism, but long-term clinical follow-up will be important. A delayed diffusion neuroimaging abnormality was also reported in the dentate nucleus of a patient with seasonal influenza encephalopathy/splenial sign [42].",
