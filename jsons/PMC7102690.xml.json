            "text": "The gastrointestinal tract of newborn calves is sterile; microbes are introduced from the environment and from the dam's birth canal and colonize the gastrointestinal tract (Ewaschuk et al., 2004, Ouwehand et al., 2002). By 3 days after birth, coliforms, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria are the predominant flora in the feces (Ouwehand et al., 2002, Vlkov\u00e1 et al., 2006). However, in the neonatal calf the microbial population is in transition and extremely sensitive. Sudden changes in diet or environment, disease, or other stress can cause alterations (Krehbiel et al., 2003, Ouwehand et al., 2002) in this microbial system. Newborn calves are often exposed to high levels of stress during the first days of life because they experience changes in environment, diet, feeding conditions, handling, and immunity. It is during this period that calves develop diarrhea, the most common health concern and cause of death during the preweaning period. Calves with diarrhea require prompt attention and care; failure to treat these calves can lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality (Kertz, 2003, Lundborg, 2004, Ribeiro et al., 2009). Diarrhea has been related to an increase of coliform bacteria counts in the intestines and a decrease in Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria counts (Krehbiel et al., 2003, Ouwehand et al., 2002). The increase of coliform bacteria in the intestines may produce putrefactive substances and harm the host (Fujisawa et al., 2010). As a result, gut microbiota are important to the health and development of the host (Ng et al., 2009, Rowland et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp., have been used as feed supplements to influence the gut microbiota to stimulate immune responses in the host (He et al., 2000). The bacteria in these supplements, like Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (Ewaschuk et al., 2004), Lactobacillus acidophilus (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993), and Lactobacillus gasseri K7 (Bogovi\u010d et al., 2006), had been proven to survive the gastrointestinal tract to then colonize the intestinal mucosa. Once in the intestines the bacteria in the supplements are believed to improve intestinal microbial balance by decreasing the adherence of pathogens in the lumen of the intestinal mucosa and affecting the mucosal immune system (Isolauri et al., 2001, Ng et al., 2009). There are many studies with lactic acid bacteria supplements in humans and rodents, and they have shown beneficial effects at the intestinal level, such as decreasing diarrhea in children (Rowland et al., 2010), decreasing or increasing the numbers of IgA and CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria (Perdigon et al., 1999), reducing gastric mucosal inflammation in humans (Sakamoto et al., 2001), and preventing gastric ulcers in rats (Uchida and Kurakazu, 2004). Also other aspects of the immune system are influenced, such as increasing plasma IgA in humans and increasing the amount of IgA in response to Salmonella typhimurium inoculation in rodents (Erickson and Hubbard, 2000).",

Twenty-eight Holstein heifer and 12 Holstein bull calves from the university herd were randomly assigned to 2 groups (20/treatment; equal numbers of heifers and bulls on each treatment) at 1 day of age. Calves were removed from their dams within 1 h of birth, fed pooled frozen colostrum for 2 feedings (4 L/day) and then fed transition milk (second and third milking) from their respective dams for 2 days before being changed to milk replacer. Samples of colostrum (20 mL) were collected and analyzed for IgG and IgA using ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. Montgomery, TX, USA) to be used as a baseline in further calf IgG and IgA analyses. Calves were vaccinated after birth for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and parainfluenza3 (1 intranasal dose TSV-2; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA) and for bovine rota-coronavirus (1 oral dose Calf-Guard; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA). A blood sample was taken between 24 and 48 h for measurement of IgG status. Calves were housed in 1.2 \u00d7 2.4-m, open-sided, individual pens bedded with wood shavings in a naturally ventilated barn. The control group was fed commercial milk replacer (20% crude protein, 20% crude fat; Renaissance Nutrition, Inc., Roaring Spring, PA, USA) containing a coccidiostat (Deccox; 0.05 g/kg; Alpharma, Inc. Bridgewater, NJ, USA) but no other additives. The second group was fed the same milk replacer with Prebio Support (PB; Meiji Feed Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan), according to company recommendations (20 g/day) which contained fermentation products of L. gasseri OLL2716 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3. Addition of PB began on day 2 and continued through week 5; 10 g of product was added to transition milk or milk replacer at each feeding. All milk replacer was fed twice daily at 6% of birth body weight per feeding. During week 6, calves were fed once a day at 6% of birth weight, and weaned at the end of week 6. Fresh calf starter grain and water were offered ad libitum and fed daily from day 1 of age with refusals weighed weekly to monitor feed intake. Nutrient composition of milk replacer and calf starter is listed in Table 1\n.",

The increase of beneficial bacteria during this time is related with the beginning of the bacteria population in the intestine of the newborn calf as reported by Vlkov\u00e1 et al. (2006). However, from day 6 to day 10 Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria counts decreased and Clostridia counts increased. This change of bacteria is probably related to the diarrhea that calves developed. Previously, diarrhea has been related with an increase of coliforms and a decrease in Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria counts (Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996). Higher counts of Bifidobacteria in calves supplemented with this prebiotic product have been found at 21 days of age (Fujisawa et al., 2010). Since there was some degree of variability in Clostridia levels in the calves and this seems to correspond to when calves had higher scour scores, this finding may merit further investigation to determine if prebiotic treatment could help decrease clostridial colonization in the intestine during this critical time.",

            "text": "In general, PB increased Lactobacilli counts and tended to increase Bifidobacteria counts in the feces of dairy calves, but did not significantly decrease Clostridia and Enterobacteria. The increase of Lactobacilli has been found before in calves supplemented with mixed Lactobacilli during 9 weeks (Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996) and with L. acidophilus isolated from humans and calves (Bruce et al., 1979). However, in a previous study with this product (PB) in calves, only an increase in Bifidobacteria, not Lactobacilli, was observed (Fujisawa et al., 2010). The effects of Lactobacilli supplementation on coliforms have been positive in some trials but not in others and may be related to the specific bacteria used. Bruce et al. (1979) found a decrease of coliforms in calves when an increase of Lactobacilli was found, but Fujisawa et al., 2010, Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996 did not find this decrease in coliform counts. Lactic acid bacteria supplements are believed to increase beneficial bacteria in the intestine and to decrease various pathogens. However, bacteria in the intestines could be modified by many factors, such as diet, disease, stress, or various drugs (Mitsuoka, 2000). In this trial C. parvum was a problem for all calves and the use of antibiotics was necessary in some calves to help their recovery. Previous results using a supplement of L. acidophilus in waste milk did not find any effect (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993), but when they used this supplement in milk replacer without medication they found positive results (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993). Penicillin, chlortetracycline, and tylosin tend to inhibit the growth of mixed cultures of bacteria. It is possible that we could not realize the potential benefits of PB because of antibiotic sensitivity to cephalosporin (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993). It is possible that because in this trial pathogens did not decrease with the increase of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, we did not find any effects of PB on the health of calves as reported before in calves fed lactic acid bacteria supplements (Abe et al., 1995, Higginbotham and Bath, 1993). However, some have reported that lactic acid bacteria supplements decrease diarrhea scores at weeks 5, 7, and 8 in calves (Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996); these later weeks were not measured in the present study.",

A lack of effects on weights has been found before using different types of lactic acid bacteria supplements (G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc et al., 2003, Higginbotham and Bath, 1993). However, some positive results have been found in older calves. Calves supplemented with a mixture of lactic acid bacteria for 90 days had higher body weight gains at 3 months of age (Mokhber-Dezfouli et al., 2007), and calves supplemented with Lactobacilli or Bifidobacteria from 7 days of age had higher weights after 56 days of supplementation (Abe et al., 1995). The use of PB and the increase in beneficial intestinal flora populations did not have any effects on circulating blood lymphocytes as reported before by Heinrichs et al. (2009). CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes increased slightly from week 1 to week 5 as reported previously by Kampen et al. (2006); values reported here were lower compared with means reported by Kampen et al.

Similar results have been found before in chickens supplemented with a mix of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococci (Haghighi et al., 2006). However, calves supplemented with L. acidophilus and L. plantarum or L. acidophilus 27SC for 9 weeks had higher serum IgG levels (Al-Saiady, 2010). One of the possible reasons why we did not find any effect of PB on IgG is because plasma IgG levels in both groups at week 0 were higher than minimum recommended levels (> 10 mg/mL of IgG) to avoid compromising survival, indicating successful passive immunity transfer. These values were still high at week 5, so it is likely that the calves' own immune systems were functional by 5 weeks of age.",

Fecal IgA decreased from day 2 to day 8, then increased from day 8 to 16, and decreased by day 20. High levels of IgA in feces at day 2 likely reflect IgA obtained from maternal colostrum. Any re-secretion of IgA back into the intestines that originated from colostrum could not be determined in this study. The decline of IgA levels reflects the decrease of IgA from colostrum ingestion. However at day 8, when calves started to develop diarrhea, IgA levels increased. This increase of IgA was likely a cellular response to the onset of diarrhea. At day 16 the levels decreased again, likely due to less intestinal stress as enteric damage healed and infections were cleared.",
