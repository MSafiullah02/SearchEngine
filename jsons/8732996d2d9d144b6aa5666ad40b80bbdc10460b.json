            "text": "Sphingolipids are ubiquitous, inert membrane components of all eukaryotic cells, but are also major constituents of lipoproteins. Most of their functional properties are still being discovered, but there are at least three crucial aspects: structure, recognition, and signal transduction. Originally, sphingolipids were thought to play merely structural roles with rather inert metabolism. However, there has been a fundamental shift in the understanding of their role in modulating various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, induction of apoptosis, and inflammation. The metabolism of sphingolipids comprises a set of highly regulated pathways that serve to control the levels of the individual molecule, their interconversions, and their functions. Most notable of these bioactive molecules are ceramide, ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphingosyl phosphorylcholine, and other derivatives (Fig. 1) [1 -3 ].",

In a very similar and stereotyped sequence, the mediators are thought to induce an acute phase response orchestrated by an array of substances produced locally or near the source or origin of the inflammatory response. Despite its basically protective function, the response can become inappropriate in intensity or duration damaging host tissues or interfering with normal metabolism. Thus, inflammation is the cause and/or consequence of a diversity of diseases and plays a major role in the development of remote organ failure. Better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of these processes is, therefore, a fundamental pre-requisite fostering the molecular understanding of novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic variables.",

            "text": "Over the past decades, immense attempts have been made to better understand the inflammatory response at the cellular and extracellular level. In the course of these studies, a multitude of lipid mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and lipoxins, has been identified and characterized. Much attention has been focused on the function of another major class of lipids, the sphingolipids, which are involved in key regulation processes such as cellular stress response and apoptosis. This chapter highlights the relevance of sphingolipids, their possible role in the regulation of the inflammatory response, and suggests key questions for further research. The term 'sphingolipid' generally refers to a number of lipids consisting of a polar head group, which is attached to the primary hydroxy-moiety of ceramides. Ceramides, the central building block of all sphingolipids, consist of a sphingoid base, which is N-acylated with fatty acids, differing in length (14-32 carbon atoms) and functionalization (degree of saturation, hydroxylation, etc.). The de novo synthesis of ceramides starts with the rate-limiting condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with serine, yielding to dihydroceramide after addition of a long chain fatty acid. The lipid mediator, resulting from desaturation, serves as a precursor for all known sphingolipids, and is further functionalized by addition of a polar head group such as carbohydrates (not referred to in this review) or phosphocholine. In eukaryotic cells, a 4,5-trans double bound is essential for bioactivity in lipids with sphingosine backbone. Sphingomyelin (= N-acyl sphingosyl phosphocholin) is the other central, but inert storage pool with crucial biophysical functions, which is localized in the outer leaflet of membranes by active flip-flop mechanisms. Removal of the head groupresulting in the generation of ceramide -is catalyzed by the function of several isoforms of sphingomyelinases, which are outlined in detail in Table 1 . Accumulation of ceramides in cellular membranes results in the formation of lipid rafts and functional clustering of surface receptors. Another mode of action is performed by direct interaction with proteins in the activation of kinases (e.g., protein kinase C, isoform a ) coupling the action of ceramide to activation of transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and stress activated protein kinases. In addition, the activation of phosphatases or cathepsin D result in signaling, which enables stimulation of adequate and fine tuned cellular responses. For ceramide clearance, ceramidases hydrolyze the N-acyl fatty acid, resulting in the generation of sphingosine, which can be phosphorylated at the primary hydroxy-moiety by isoforms of sphingosinekinase (SphK) forming sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is cleaved by S1P lyase in an irreversible manner, whereas ceramides or sphingosine can be reversible synthesized by the action of S1P-phosphatase or ceramide synthase, respectively. A Table 1 . Sphingomyelin hydrolyzing enzymes. In human tissues, five RefSeq validated proteins have so far been described, differing in pH-optima, cellular localization and functions. SMPD1 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1) codes for the acidic sphingomyelinase, which is either localized in lysosomes by mannose-6phosphate-receptor/sortilin-dependent trafficking or plasma secreted due to pro-inflammatory stimulation. SMPD2 codes for a neutral sphingomyelinase-1 (NSM1); however SMPD3 is the bona fide gene for NSM2 [83] . A variety of isoform specific inhibitors is described in the right column. major metabolite of ceramide is ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), which is formed by direct phosphorylation of ceramide by the action of a specific kinase. C1P plays a critical role regulation proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and generation of eicosanoids via direct binding to target proteins, e.g. phospholipase A 2 . There is also increasing evidence of a key role in phagocytosis [4] , and most importantly, inhibition of SMPD1 by physical interaction has been observed [5] .",

            "text": "Beyond the stimulus-dependent activation of sphingolipid metabolism, considerable evidence has been gathered regarding the role of subcellular compartmentalization of the generation and accumulation of individual metabolites. Numerous studies point to a tightly controlled localization of enzyme and lipid pools within the cell, e.g., suggesting a specific, apoptogenic role for endogenously generated ceramide from mitochondrial membranes [7] . Within the different compartments, distinct isoforms of sphingomyelinases perform specific functions via generated ceramide, such as inhibition of protein kinase C translocation, inhibition of NF-\u03baB, and aggregation of the Fas receptor [6, 8] . Another mode of action is the endosomal generation of ceramide by acid sphingomyelinase as a direct activator of cathepsin D [9] . Considering that de novo synthesis of ceramide is mainly restricted to the endoplasmatic reticulum as well as to membranes associated with mitochondria and the nucleus, the localization and the effects of synthesis inhibitors, such as fumonisins, suggest a pivotal role for ceramide subfractions in mediating apoptosis. Furthermore, recent evidence has indicated the contribution of the mitochondria and the nucleus as major sites in the initiation of apoptosis by ceramide [10] .",

A corresponding protein, termed 'factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation' (FAN), was described which binds to NSD, resulting in a functional coupling of the TNF receptor with neutral sphingomyelinase activation [18] . Results demonstrating an interaction of neutral sphingomyelinase with activated C-kinase 1 as well as caveolin-1 further suggest that the formation of multiprotein complexes are involved in the signal transduction from TNF-[ to neutral sphingomyelinase, thus regulating its activity [19] .

As a result the proteins are present in both blood plasma and intracellular lysosomes [12] . Previous studies suggested that the lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate receptor is implicated in SMPD1 trafficking [23] . However, the type I transmembrane glycoprotein, sortilin, is also involved in targeting of the protein: Truncated sortilin partially inhibits lysosomal trafficking and enhances the secretion of SMPD1 [24] . Among the known types of eukaryotic sphingomyelinases, only the secretory variant, SMPD1, has so far been shown to be responsible for extracellular hydrolysis of membrane and lipoprotein bound sphingomyelin [22] . SMPD1 is secreted by macrophages, human skin fibroblasts, and human vascular endothelial cells; the latter are assumed to be the chief source of the enzyme [12, 25] . In endothelial cells, apical as well as basolateral secretion of SMPD1 is stimulated by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1 q , interferon (IFN) * , IFN q , TNF-[ , platelet activating factor (PAF), and ROS as endogenous mediators, as well as endotoxin as an exogenous mediator [25] . The secreted form of SMPD1 is stimulated by zinc-ions, whereas the lysosomal form is already tightly bound to the cation. Thus, the source of the activity can be distinguished as originating, e.g., from damaged and disintegrating endothelium or from activated cells driven by a pro-inflammatory impetus. An increase to pH 7.4 which is far beyond the optimum for the lysosomal protein as found in plasma, appears to affect only the substrate affinity (i.e., the K m ), but not the activity (V max ) of SMPD1 [24] , a fact important in estimating the extralysosomal activity of the enzyme [21, 27] .",

Activation by S1P binding results in sequestering of lymphocytes from the circulation to lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. This redistribution effectively reduces T cell numbers at the sites of inflamed tissue or graft sites. TNF-[ induced sphingosine kinase 1(SphK1) activity is followed by increased S1P levels and subsequent cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activation. The inhibition of S1P clearance, e.g. by targeting S1P lyase or S1P phosphatase, augments COX-2 activation and consequently prostaglandin (PG)E2 generation. Exogenous S1P addition dose-dependently reproduced COX-2 induction observed subsequent to TNF-[ addition. In neutrophils, the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin increased SphK activity, and S1P generation appears to be a key event in neutrophilic priming by TNF-[ and other stimuli [28, 29] . During activation of mast cells, S1P levels increase resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes and cytokines. In contrast, sphingosine has an opposing effect on mast cell activation [30] .",

An abundance of evidence indicates that the formation of ceramideenriched membrane raft structures facilitates the invasion of various pathogens [37 -39] . Often, the final result of ceramide-mediated cellular entry is containment and/or inactivation of the pathogen. The importance of ceramide in pathogen invasion is underscored by studies investigating Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Sindbis virus, which have been shown to activate SMPD1 resulting in rapid ceramide formation. The strength of these studies was the demonstration that inactivation of SMPD1 nearly completely hindered pathogen internalization. As a result, all pathogen-associated alterations of membrane scaffold have been shown to mediate internalization of bacteria, viruses, and parasites into the host cell, to initiate apoptosis of the host cell upon infection, and to regulate the release of cytokines from infected mammalian cells [37] . On the other hand, ceramide-enriched membrane platforms are also central to the host defense against potentially lethal pathogens like P. aeruginosa which, upon infection, trig-gers activation of SMPD1 and the release of ceramide in sphingolipid-rich rafts within minutes [39] . Failure to generate ceramide-enriched membrane platforms in infected cells results in an unabated inflammatory response, such as massive release of IL-1 q and septic death in mice.",

The infection of human epithelial cells with rhinovirus strains triggers a rapid activation of SMPD1, the formation of ceramide in the cell membrane and, finally, the formation of large ceramide-enriched membrane platforms.

As described above, NSMII activity and trafficking are tightly regulated by the oxidative intracellular status in a complex dynamic process [20] . On the other hand, sphingolipids are also known to play an important role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis through regulation of plasma membrane oxidants, such as NADPH oxidase, with subsequent disturbance of mitochondrial integrity and induction of apoptosis [44] . Post-translationally, both recombinant and plasma borne SMPD1 are also directly activated in the presence of oxidizing agents by modification either of a 'cysteine switch' or by a copper induced dimerization via disulfide bond formation responsible for an increase in enzymatic hydrolysis [45, 46] . It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that at least some of the above-named stress stimuli stimulate SMPD1 via redox processes. Ceramide itself is known to trigger the release of ROS, from, for example, endothelial cells [47] . Thus, under oxidative conditions, it might be part of a self-perpetuating and positive feedback mechanism for the post-translational activation of SMPD1. Interestingly, in neutrophils, ceramide generation, CD95 clustering, and apoptosis were dependent on ROS suggesting that an altered redox status initiates ligand-independent death receptor signaling via activation of SMPD1 and clustering of preformed DISC components in lipid rafts [48] .",

Furthermore, raised SMPD1 levels have also been reported in children with hypercytokinemia due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [54] . In order to achieve a deeper insight into the functional role of SMPD1 during sepsis, we analyzed its presence and activity in patients with various degrees of different concomitant diseases, variable sources of infection, and a broad range of disease severity as reflected by differing levels of inflammatory markers. Circulating SMPD1 was found to be markedly elevated on the first day of sepsis.

In addition to an increase in the constitutive activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells dependent on illness severity, ex vivo treatment of the cells with tricyclic antidepressive drugs, such as amitryptiline or imipramine, resulted in a rapid reduction in SMPD1 activity. As reported above, ceramide generation changes the composition of membrane structures thus mediating the formation of platforms, which facilitate receptor clustering and signaling. Thus, alterations in SMPD1 activity may have clinical implications for the regulation of serotonin and dopamine reuptake transporter activity. The pathophysiological significance of altered SMPD1 activity in major depression remains to be further elucidated. The observed increase, however, supports the concept that SMPD1 activity and ceramide generation may function in these molecular phenomena, may contribute to subsequent interference with other enzymes such as phospholipase A 2 and isoforms of protein kinase C, as well as synaptic transmission. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that SMPD1 activity may be a molecular target for antidepressant drug therapy.",

Sathishkumar et al. demonstrated, in patients who underwent high dose spatially fractionation radiation, an elevation of both the level of plasma secreted SMPD1 activity and the concentration of lipoprotein bound ceramide, with a correlation of SMPD1 activity and clinical outcome [56] . Most importantly, a role of SMPD1 and ceramide in the generation of PAF-mediated pulmonary edema was shown by Goggel and colleagues [57] . In an animal study, it was clearly demonstrated that SMPD1 plays a critical role both locally in ceramide generation in the stimulated tissue as well as in the increase of vascular permeability resulting in edema formation. Accumulation of ceramide was paralleled by synthesis and release of aspirin-inhibitable prostaglandin production. SMPD1 deficient mice exhibited 50 % less pulmonary edema than wild type animals. Consistent with these findings, agents interfering with ceramide generation as well as anti-ceramide antisera reduced edema formation initially triggered by exogenously administered PAF, bacterial endotoxin, or intratracheal instillation of acid. The latter two models are relevant to the increased permeability during lung edema observed in the clinical condition of sepsis or aspiration-induced pneumonia, which are common and often lethal precipitators of acute lung injury (ALI) in humans [58] . On the other hand, systemic effects were proven by the release of the enzyme into circulation via venous efflux enabling extra-pulmonary ceramide generation at the outer leaflet of remote endothelial membranes [57] . In this context, it is noteworthy that until now plasma secreted SMPD1 is the only enzyme shown to be responsible for extracellular sphingomyelin hydrolysis; activity of NSMII or other sphingomyelinase isoforms has not been observed in plasma [49, 57] . Additionally, SMPD1 translocates to cell surfaces and has activity in the outer leaflet of the cellular membrane; the membrane-associated enzyme may behave differently to recombinant protein administered in solution [34] . However, it is not yet clear whether the enzyme translocated onto the plasma membrane upon CD95 stimulation [33] is identical to the form described by Tabas as the plasma secreted isotype [21] .",

By triggering Weibel-Palade body exocytosis, ceramide activated endothelial cells release von Willebrand factor and P-selectin, which induce leukocyte rolling as well as platelet adhesion and aggregation [62] . This phenomenon, which was also observed after addition of sphingomyelinase, suggests a novel and intriguing mechanism by which ceramide may contribute as an intermediary to vascular inflammation raising a thrombophilic state. A hypothetical schema of the functions of plasma secreted SMPD1 and subsequent ceramide generation during systemic inflammation and infection is outlined in Fig. 2 . It is noteworthy that the observed plasma activities in patients with inflammation of different origins clearly exceed the enzymatic activity reported to induce biological effects in cell culture systems [63, 64] . SMPD1 has been shown to hydrolyze sphingomyelin in low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles [27] , which is important considering that most of serum sphingomyelin and nearly half of the ceramides are known to be localized in circulating LDL [49] . Therefore, the accumulation of ceramide in both circulating cells and in lipoproteins may serve as a persistent reference pool reflecting elevated plasma secreted SMPD1 activity. Though not proven, it might, therefore, be possible to discriminate between transient/short-term effects and long lasting/even mild variations by determination of enzyme activity levels in a functional assay or resulting ceramide accumulation. According to our own observations and data from other groups, there is only marginal degradation of plasma ceramide, resulting in the mentioned accumulation of the mediator in lipophilic compartments, such as plasma lipoproteins.",

For this reason, a panel of compounds was synthesized containing a polyunsaturated fatty acid bound to a chemically less reactive, under physiological conditions, 1,2-amino alcohol derivative with a cyclohexenone moiety [65] . A redoxdependent reversible mechanism is involved in regulation of NSMI activity, which can be abolished by reduced glutathione during induction of programmed cell death due to ischemia in neuronal cells [13] . Structural analogs of sphingomyelin with reactive structural moieties, such as difluoromethylenephosphonic acid, have also been described as effective, non-competitive inhibitors of TNF-[ -induced neuronal cell death [67] . In addition, various low molecular weight inhibitors of SMPD1 activity have been identified, including 5'-adenosine monophosphate (5'-AMP); tricyclic antidepressive drugs, such as imipramine, amitryptiline, or desipramine; cationic amphiphilic drugs, such as NB6, L-[ -phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns3,5P2), and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P(3)]; SR33557; and derivatives of [ -mangostin. Tricyclic antidepressants induced rapid intracellular degradation of SMPD1 and abolished enzyme activity, which could be abrogated by preincubation with the protease inhibitor, leupeptin. Interestingly, data obtained using plasmon resonance technology supported the concept of an interaction of the amphiphilic inhibitor with the enzyme and immobilized sphingomyelin containing lipid bilayers, displacing the protein from its membrane bound substrate and rendering it susceptible to proteolytic cleavage [68] .",

Remembering that SMPD1 fulfils crucial functions in host defense, a non-beneficial effect of SMPD1 inhibition during infection of mice with living bacteria in a model of polymicrobial peritoneal contamination and infection with overwhelming mortality after instillation of human feces is feasible (Bunck et al., unpublished data). FTY720, a substrate for SphK has shown tremendous promise as a regulator of multiple levels of inflammation. FTY720 is chemically derived from myriocin, an ascomycete metabolite, and is metabolized to the phosphor-derivative, FTY-P, by sphingosine kinases to become active as an S1P agonist at four of the five known S1P receptors [69] . FTY720 has been tested as an immunomodulator in renal transplant patients and patients with emphysema. The Sph1P mimetic produces lymphopenia by reducing recirculation of lymphocytes and sequestering them into lymph nodes. FTY-P induces S1P 1 R internalization of lymphocytes, which abrogates the interaction with the naturally occurring ligand, S1P, regulating lymphocyte trafficking between lymphoid organs and the sites of inflammatory response. The com-pound also induces CD31 and q -catenin expression in subcapsular sinus endothelial cells in lymph nodes. The modulation of the inflammatory response by FTY720 may be a useful intervention in a number of inflammatory conditions by targeting bioactive sphingolipid signaling function.",

            "text": "Distinct analysis of the biological effects mediated by variations in the key sphingolipid enzyme activity or its localization, as well as the complex and structurally diverse composition of the mediators, was hampered for a long time by the lack of an accurate and reliable methodology to measure the sphingolipid factors relevant in, for example, pro-inflammatory signaling. A plethora of papers stress the importance of distinguishing between de novo synthesized sphingolipids and degradation products derived from turnover or metabolism from more complex sphingolipids. Over the past decades, sphingolipids, e.g. ceramide, have been discovered to have not only structural but also signaling properties, especially during the stress response. The dynamic balance between sphingolipid metabolites existing in a phosphorylated or dephosphorylated as well as in an acylated or deacylated form, has been recognized as a fundamental factor determining cell fate because of its ambiguous and often opposing properties. On one hand, consistent with their functions as bioactive lipids, ceramide and its metabolites are present in very low levels in the cell's common lipid machinery. On the other hand, the interconvertibility of these mediators and the highly variable kinetics in metabolism present a difficult technical challenge for examining the absolute concentrations at operator-defined time points. This is of particular relevance when various agents for stimulation or analysis of cells consisting of a multitude of cellular subpopulations such as circulating leukocytes are tested. Biological examinations frequently focus on pro-apoptotic or cyto-protective effects alone when mediators are studied. Thus, for a more complete picture it is imperative to analyze all or at least a majority of the lipid mediators potentially responsible for the effects of interest. For this purpose, a number of relatively specific enzymatic methods have been developed based on the use of lipid kinases. These assays are relatively insensitive, time consuming, and require huge amounts of lipid material [70 -72] . Derivatization and subsequent separation by high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection have improved detection sensitivity [73, 74] . The problem of co-elution of related, very similar or interfering compounds, however, has to be addressed. In addition, there is an urgent need for the preparation of internal standards for each unique mediator of interest. Methods based on metabolic labeling of the cellular sphingolipid pool with radioactive or fluorescently labeled compounds are also burdened with concerns regarding improper distribution within the cell and the cellular substructures, uneven behavior in the cellular membrane, and questionable metabolic and enzymatic properties in comparison to the naturally occurring structure of interest. Overall this may be an inefficient and inaccurate method for absolute mass level determinations [75 -77] .",

The use of mass spectroscopy is an intriguing feature for more detailed study of numerous agonists and antagonists and to better address the effects of previously undetectable variations in concentrations of mediators with a sphingolipid backbone. In fact, the methods of sphingolipidomics also facilitate the determination of isotype specific effects, such as the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis exclusively by C16:0 ceramide [80] . Additional information is also obtained by the analysis of the biological significance of the presence or absence of a double bond in the backbone. This difference cannot be distinguished by conventional methods due to strong structural similarity and the poor discrimination when using enzymatic methods. Saturated analogs, however, are usually biologically inactive [81] . Sphingolipidomics will provide thrilling information on the source and the 'job history' of a unique metabolite by comparative analysis of the levels of its de novo precursors versus its degradation products. The convenience of the method can also be applied for the discrimination of cellular effects of extra-or intracellular sphingolytic activity as well as for the determination of the biological effects, e.g., of a selected sphingomyelinase isoform targeted to distinct sub-cellular compartments. Such studies are mandatory for probing the impact of different intracellular sphingomyelin pools [7, 82] . We are convinced that sphingolipidomics will provide useful information on the role, the origin, and the fate of a variety of sphingolipids orchestrating cellular signaling.",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence suggesting a pivotal role of sphingolipids as mediators regulating apoptosis, the cellular stress response, and inflammation. Key regulating enzymes in these processes are sphingomyelinases and ceramidases, generating a fine tuned 'rheostat' between lipid mediators often responsible for opposite cellular effects. The generation of knock-out models and administration of specific low molecular weight inhibitors has enabled the detailed study of the effects at a cellular level. Accumulating evidence emphasizes a critical role of ceramide in systemic inflammation mediated by a plasma secreted isoform of acid sphingomyelinase, SMPD1. An intriguing functional concept for the role of plasma secreted SMPD1 in receptor signaling activation pathways suggests that the enzyme modifies membrane fluidity by the formation of ceramide enriched rafts. Subsequent structural alterations of membrane morphology may then allow rapid and efficient signaling inside the cell, explaining the function of the enzyme in a variety of effects in cellular stress response, but also in the development of MOF during systemic inflammation. Accordingly, plasma secreted SMPD1 is hypothesized not only to function as a signaling molecule per se, but also to be involved in the host response and development of remote organ failure. However, for future therapeutic interventions, it is very important to specifically target the enzyme and the ceramide pool in the precise tissue or cell. A therapeutic intervention of ceramide generation might be envisioned to prevent tissue damage during development of organ failure and to prevent infection of mammalian cells with P. aeruginosa and other pathogens.",
