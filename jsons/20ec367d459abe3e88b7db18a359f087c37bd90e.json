Severe infections can lead to a variety of diseases, including poliomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis. Enterovirus infections have also been implicated in asthmatic exacerbations and type 1 diabetes. The large disease spectrum of the closely related enteroviruses may be partially, but not fully, explained by differences in tissue tropism. The molecular mechanisms by which enteroviruses cause disease are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that the two enteroviral proteases, 2A pro and 3C pro , are important mediators of pathology. These proteases perform the posttranslational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein, but they also cleave several host-cell proteins in order to promote the production of new virus particles, as well as to evade the cellular antiviral immune responses. Enterovirus-associated processing of cellular proteins may also contribute to pathology, as elegantly demonstrated by the 2A pro -mediated cleavage of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes contributing to Coxsackievirus-induced cardiomyopathy. It is likely that improved tools to identify targets for these proteases will reveal additional host protein substrates that can be linked to specific enterovirus-associated diseases. Here, we discuss the function of the enteroviral proteases in the virus replication cycle and review the current knowledge regarding how these proteases modulate the infected cell in order to favour virus replication, including ways to avoid detection by the immune system.

Several pathological mechanisms may be explained by the activity of the viral proteases 2A pro and 3C pro .

However, especially in the persistent types of infections when the production of viral proteins, including proteases 2A pro and 3C pro , continues for months or years, the degradation of host proteins may be virus-and tissue-specific and may lead to more selective pathological processes (e.g. myocarditis and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy).

(3) Immune evasion. Host-cell immune response is blunted by proteolysis mediated by viral proteases 2A pro and 3C pro as intracellular receptors (MDA5/RIG-1), and proteins relaying innate signalling (IPS-1) are targeted, blocking the production of interferons and cytokines. (4) Replication. Viral proteins, in orchestration with host-cell factors, replicate the viral RNA at membrane-associated replication sites. (5) Release.
