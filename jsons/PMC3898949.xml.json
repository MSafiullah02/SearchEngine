During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic between Nov, 2002, and July, 2003, molecular analysis of SARS-CoV from patients from various geographical regions was essential for understanding viral evolution and the spread of the disease.3 Phylogenetic analysis suggested that SARS-CoV probably originated in bats and spread to people.

The cellular receptor for MERS-CoV has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26)5 and the structure of the receptor binding domain of the virus spike protein complexed with DPP4 has been established.6 The tissue distribution of this receptor within mammals is consistent with the lung and kidney pathology of the virus.5 The conservation of the receptor across mammals suggests many possible non-human hosts; however, so far no animal reservoir has been identified for MERS-CoV. The closest relative to MERS-CoV was identified through phylogenetic analysis of a short fragment sequenced from the bat species Neoromicia zuluensis.7 However, in view of the estimated evolutionary rate of MERS-CoV, the most recent common ancestor between this isolate and MERS-CoV existed in bats more than 44 years ago.8 A recent serological study of dromedary camels in Oman and the Canary Islands found cross-reactive antibodies to MERS-CoV, but the investigators were unable to amplify any MERS-CoV-like viral sequences from the samples.9 A small fragment of sequence identical to the EMC/2012 MERS-CoV has been reported from a Taphozous perforatus bat captured in Saudi Arabia, suggesting a regionally relevant bat reservoir.10\n",

Deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted from real-time PCR confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Typically 50 \u03bcL of nucleic acid was generated from 200 \u03bcL of tracheal aspirate or from a nasopharyngeal or throat swab with automated processing. PCR amplified DNA amplicons covering the entire MERS-CoV genome were prepared as described elsewhere.14 The PCR amplicons for each sample were pooled for Illumina library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) preparation with each sample processed to include a unique barcode sequence. Standard MiSeq 150 base pair paired-end reads were generated. Sequence data were de-multiplexed into sample-specific readsets, processed to remove primer sequences at the ends of reads, and trimmed from their 3\u2032 end until the median phred-scaled quality score was >35\u00b70, discarding reads smaller than 125 nucleotides. The processed readsets were assembled into large contiguous sequences (contigs) using the de-novo assembler SPAdes.15 The readset was also mapped against the Al-Hasa_1_2013 genome (GenBank accession number KF18656716) using SMALT (version 0.5.0) to generate a reference-based consensus. In cases where the de-novo assembly was split over several contigs, they were aligned against the reference-based consensus before merging. Any differences between de-novo and reference-based methods were resolved by direct examination of the original read set.",

Geographical locations of the ancestral viruses were co-estimated along with the phylogeny, to assess the spatial evolution of the virus. These results suggest the circulating virus in Saudi Arabia is centred around Riyadh, with sporadic excursions to other centres; the most probable geographical location for all of the internal nodes, except for the Al-Hasa outbreak, is in Riyadh (figure 3). However, with the exception of the ancestor to the Al-Hasa outbreak, the posterior probability on these ancestral geographical locations is low, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on these inferred locations. The number of isolates for each location is small, with only Riyadh and Al-Hasa having more than one isolate. Because the two Al-Hasa isolates cluster together, the positioning of Riyadh along the internal branches could be due to it being the only location present at many distinct positions in the topology. However, although the posterior probability on the root node being Riyadh is low (0\u00b748), it is still more than double that of any other location, suggesting that the low probabilities are due to the small number of genomes (the legend of figure 3 lists the posterior probabilities). Additional genomes will be needed to improve confidence in these inferences.",

The most important findings from this study are that at least two distinct lineages were circulating in Riyadh in October, 2012, and transmission patterns in the epidemic are consistent with both human-to-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic events. An updated evolutionary rate supports the circulation of MERS-CoV since the middle of 2011.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed, ProMed, and Genbank on Aug 15, 2013, for all relevant English language publications with the terms \u201cMiddle East respiratory syndrome\u201d, \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d, and \u201cHCoV-EMC\u201d individually and in combination with the terms \u201csequence\u201d, \u201cgenome\u201d, and \u201cphylogeny\u201d. Articles relevant to our report are cited in the text. The phylogenetic relation of our 21 Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV sequences was assessed in combination with the nine published MERS-CoV genomes. The geographical distribution and phylogenetic relation of MERS-CoV across time in Saudi Arabia was reviewed. Geographical locations of the ancestral viruses were co-estimated along with the phylogeny, to assess the spatial evolution of the virus.\nInterpretation\nMERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission. There is little information about the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV and how this relates to virus transmission. MERS-CoV genomes obtained directly from 21 MERS patients from across Saudi Arabia show three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV were identified and suggest lower R0 values. MERS-CoV is evolving within the largely human-to-human Al-Hasa cluster but the phenotypic consequences of these variants needs assessment before adaption can be inferred. Transmission within Saudi Arabia seems consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Our results provide important and substantial genomic information on MERS-CoV and a direction for further investigation. That there were three genetically distinct lineages of MERS-CoV in Riyadh suggests it is unlikely that the Riyadh infections are the result of one, continuous human-to-human transmission chain. Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed to provide the necessary information to interrupt transmission and contain the virus.",

Our data suggest that local spread of virus in the Al-Hasa outbreak might be more complex than previously thought, with additional sources of the virus contributing to hitherto human-to-human transmission chains. This is consistent with the multiple tree clusters described by Breban and colleagues11 and support their optimistic R0 scenario for MERS-CoV.",

These include the Munich/AbuDhabi, England-Qatar, Riyadh_3 cluster, the Bisha-1, Riyadh_1 cluster, and the singletons Hafr-Al-Batin_1, Riyadh_2, Buraidah_1, and England2-HPA (Makkah). The Riyadh region shows three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes. In view of the evolutionary rate of the virus it is not expected that a single zoonotic event was the source of the epidemic. Such high local diversity could arise from zoonotic events in Riyadh if the MERS-CoV diversity in the animal reservoir is being continuously imported from other regions. Alternately, Riyadh is the largest population centre in Saudi Arabia and therefore the largest target for human-to-human transmission. The many circulating genotypes might be a consequence of the movement of infected people from other regions, this is supported by Riyadh_1_2012 clustering with Bisha_1_2012 and Riyadh_3-2013 clustering with viruses from Doha (England_Qatar_2012) and Abu Dhabi (Munich/AbuDhabi), the two largest urban centres in neighbouring countries (figure 6\n).",

MERS-CoV has not yet been identified in any animal sources. Therefore field studies of all probable reservoir species, including camels, bats, goats, sheep, dogs, cats, rodents, and others in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries are ongoing. A history of contact of Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV patients with camels and goats has been reported in some cases. Serological testing for MERS-CoV has detected antibodies to the virus in camels in Oman and the Canary Islands9 suggesting that a virus that stimulates antibody responses cross-reactive with MERS-CoV has been recently circulating among camels; however, the only way to establish if the virus eliciting the antibody response is the same as human MERS-CoV is to isolate the MERS-CoV itself in a camel. Further, the recent reports of mild and asymptomatic cases discovered through monitoring and testing of contacts of confirmed cases suggest that the focus on severe disease as a surveillance strategy might be missing substantial numbers of milder or asymptomatic cases.",

The posterior probabilities on the geographical location of the root are Al-Hofuf 0\u00b703, Riyadh 0\u00b748, Buraidah 0\u00b704, Bisha 0\u00b718, Abu Dhabi 0\u00b705, Doha 0\u00b713, Hafr-Al-Batin 0\u00b704, and Makkah 0\u00b704.

The light blue nodes show genomes with at least one statistically possible transmission linkage to a known MERS-CoV genome (transmission cases). The coloured nodes in the bottom panel (sporadic cases) are MERS-CoV genomes that cannot be linked by direct transmission to any known MERS-CoV case. Genomes are organised by date of sample collection, and stays in hospital A or D are shown by grey horizontal bars. Red squares show potential transmission, either by shared dialysis session or by direct exposure to a known MERS case. Black arrows show proposed transmission pairs supported by the sequence data, dashed red arrows show proposed transmission pairs not supported by the sequence data. The expected number of differences between each pair of sequences was calculated as the product of the interval between sampling, the evolutionary rate of the virus, and the maximum common length between the two virus genomes. Assuming that the number of differences between two sequences over a length of time is Poisson distributed, with \u03bb equal to the expected number of mutations, the probability of getting the observed number of mutations between the two sequences by chance can be calculated from the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution. A transmission pair was rejected if the cumulative probability value was less than 0\u00b705. A Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons, resulting in an adjusted significance level of 3\u00b785 \u00d7 10\u22123.
