His blood routine test was normal. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the patient's throat swab was positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid. Unenhanced chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) showed subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) with consolidation in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1A). After 5 days of treatment with ribavirin and interferon, the patient's temperature decreased to normal and repeat chest CT showed healing of the lesion (Fig. 1B). After 13 days after admission, repeat throat swab RT-PCR turned negative, and chest CT showed complete resolution (Fig. 1C).",

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report of the HRCT and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 in the English literature. Two patients (case 1 and 3) in our study were symptomatic, both of them had fever and dry cough, and one of them had diarrhea in addition. Thus, fever and dry cough are 2 core symptoms of pediatric patients, which is in line with the adults.4 However, up to 60% of the patients (case 2, 4, and 5) in the present study were asymptomatic, so the asymptomatic children with Wuhan contact (lived or traveled to Wuhan or had close contact with any confirmed patients) are recommended to do a COVID-19 RT-PCR screening. Besides, we noted that up to 66.7% asymptomatic patients (case 2 and 4) had pulmonary GGO, so asymptomatic pediatric patients may be positive for HRCT, and thus, HRCT is recommended in the screening of suspected pediatric patients.",

It is reported that up to 44% adult patients had all 5 lobes affected,1 whereas only 1 patient (case 2) in the present study affected bilaterally, and 3 patients just affected 1 lobe. The HRCT manifestations of adult patients with COVID-19 were reported to be very diverse1\u20133: most appeared as pure GGO, GGO with consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, bronchiolar wall thickening, and crazy paving pattern, whereas rare manifestations included halo sign, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy. In our series of pediatric patients, only GGO and consolidative GGO were found. Pan et al5 studied the time course of lung changes of adult COVID-19 patients and concluded that lung lesions would gradually be absorbed in 2 weeks. On the contrary, most lesions in our study were fully resolved in a week. Furthermore, Song et al3 divided the adult patients with COVID-19 to younger (<50 years) and elder group (>50 years) and found that elder group tended to have more areas of lung involvement and more consolidation. Taking their evidence together, we speculate that the pediatric patients generally have milder CT findings than adults.",
