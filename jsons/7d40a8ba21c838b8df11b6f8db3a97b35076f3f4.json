A precautionary approach is taken in a situation of ongoing review of past actions. Such reviews are often critical of delayed and inadequate responses by national blood services.",

It is noteworthy that, at least in developed countries, the acknowledged major blood borne viruses shared a common epidemiology enabling the application of donor exclusion criteria based on sexual behaviour and other lifestyle risks. This along with the application of increasingly sensitive serological testing methods and in many countries the introduction of molecular based testing has significantly improved the overall safety of donated blood. Indeed by the end of the 20th Century the residual risk of transmission of viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B and C had become very small indeed with reported risks of less than 1 in 2 or more million for major viruses commonly quoted.",

In this context, careful management of the balance between safety and supply becomes very important. Finally, emerging threats can impact on the blood supply because of increased demand for blood components to treat patients. Some infections will impact in a number of ways.",

For new infections there will inevitably be a delay before suitable assays are available but the application of nucleic acid-based testing will potentially shorten this. There is also increasing interest in the use of pathogen reduction systems in the management of emerging threats. These technologies will potentially 'disinfect' blood components in the same way as specific viral inactivation procedures have revolutionized the safety of fractionated plasma products.

Many cases are not associated with clinical disease. There is however considerable clinical data to indicate that occult HBV infection can be associated with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Hepatitis B infection can be transmitted by transfusion of blood collected from healthy donors with occult HBV infection. This may reflect 'tail end' carriage of normal HBV infection or might occur due to the presence of mutant forms of the virus that are not easily detected by standard HBsAg assays. Occult HBV infection thus raises a number of questions for blood services in Asia. This extends beyond the question as to whether costly HBV DNA testing should be implemented to include a requirement for careful evaluation of HBsAg assays to ensure both high sensitivity and also to maximize the detection of common mutant forms that exist in the local community.",
