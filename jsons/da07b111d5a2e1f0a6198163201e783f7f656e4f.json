To test whether representations of a sound's pitch might derive from this need for compression, we compared discrimination of harmonic and inharmonic sounds across delays. In contrast to inharmonic spectra, harmonic spectra can be summarized, and thus compressed, using their fundamental frequency (f0). Despite being comparable for sounds presented back-to-back, discrimination was better for harmonic than inharmonic stimuli when sounds were separated in time, implicating memory representations unique to harmonic sounds.",

Audition, for instance, is argued to also make use of both a sensory trace and a short-term memory store (9) , but the representational characteristics of the memory store are not well characterized. There is evidence that memory for speech includes abstracted representations of phonetic features (10, 11) or categorical representations of phonemes themselves (12) (13) (14) . Beyond speech, the differences between transient and persistent representations of sound remain unclear. This situation plausibly reflects a historical tendency within hearing research to favor simple stimuli, such as single frequencies, for which there is not much to abstract or compress. Such stimuli have been used to characterize the decay characteristics of auditory memory (15) (16) (17) (18) , its vulnerability to interference (19, 20) , and the possibility of distinct memory resources for different sound attributes (21, 22) , but otherwise place few constraints on the underlying representations.",

This summary might not be needed if two sounds are presented back-to-back, as high-fidelity (but quickly-fading) sensory traces of the sounds could be compared.

We tested pitch discrimination with harmonic and inharmonic stimuli, varying the length of silent pauses between sounds being compared. We predicted that if listeners summarize harmonic sounds with a representation of their f0, then performance should be better for harmonic compared to inharmonic stimuli. This prediction held across a variety of different types of sounds and task conditions, but only when sounds were separated in time. In addition, individual differences in performance across conditions indicate that listeners switch from representing the spectrum to representing the f0 depending on memory demands. Reliance on f0-based pitch thus appears to be driven in part by the need to compress sound into memory.",

This decrease in performance is consistent with previous studies examining memory for complex tones (20, 32) . However, we observed a more pronounced decrease in performance for inharmonic stimuli, with worse performance compared to harmonic stimuli at both delays (5 seconds: t(11)=4.48, p<.001 for .25 semitone trials, t(11)=2.12, p=.057 for .5 semitone trials; 10 seconds: t(11)=3.64, p<.01 for .25 semitone trials, t(11)=4.07, p<.01 for .5 semitone trials) despite indistinguishable performance for harmonic and inharmonic sounds without a delay (t(11)=0.43, p=.67 for .25 semitone trials, t(11)=-0.77, p=.46 for .5 semitone trials). These differences produced a significant interaction between the effect of delay and that of harmonicity (F(2, 22)=7.66, p<.01, hp 2 =.41 for .25 semitone trials, F(2, 22)=3.77, p<.05, hp 2 =.26 for .5 semitone trials). This effect was present in both musicians and non-musicians (Supplementary Figure 1 ; averaging across the two difficulty conditions we found no main effect of musicianship: F(1,10)=3.73, p=.08, hp 2 =.27 , and no interaction between musicianship, harmonicity and delay length F(2,20)=0.58, p=.57, hp 2 =.06), suggesting that the harmonic advantage is not dependent on extensive musical training. Overall, the results of Experiment 1 are consistent with the idea that a sound's spectrum can mediate pitch discrimination over short time intervals (potentially via a sensory trace of the spectrum), but that the memory of a sound's pitch over longer periods relies on a representation of f0.",

Masking noise was included in all conditions to prevent distortion products from being audible, which might otherwise be used to perform the task. Performance without a delay was worse for Interleaved Harmonic tones than for the regular Harmonic and Inharmonic tones, but unlike those other two conditions, Interleaved Harmonic performance did not deteriorate significantly over time (Figure 2b ). There was no main effect of delay for either .25 semitones (F(2,48)=1.23, p=.30, hp 2 =.05) or .5 semitones (F(2,48)=2.56, p=.09, hp 2 =.10), in contrast to the significant main effects of delay for Harmonic and Inharmonic conditions at both difficulty levels (p<.001 in all cases). This pattern of results is consistent with the idea that there are two representations that listeners could use to discriminate pitch: a sensory trace of the spectrum which decays quickly over time, and a representation of the f0 which is better retained over a delay.

We also analyzed individual differences in pitch discrimination thresholds across a large number of participants. This analysis showed that harmonic and inharmonic discrimination thresholds were highly correlated without a delay between sounds, but were less so with a delay. By contrast, thresholds for harmonic tones and tones designed to isolate f0-based discrimination showed the opposite pattern, becoming more correlated with a delay between sounds. Together, the results suggest that listeners use different representations depending on memory demands, comparing spectra for sounds nearby in time, and the f0 for sounds separated in time.

One possibility is that representations of f0 are in some cases less accurate and produce poorer discrimination than those of the spectrum if memory is not involved. The results with interleaved harmonics (stimuli designed to isolate f0-based pitch) are consistent with this idea, as discrimination without a delay was worse for interleaved harmonics than for either harmonic or inharmonic tones that had similar spectral composition across notes (we note that this deficit could also reflect other stimulus differences, such as the potentially interfering effects of the changes in the spectrum from note to note). The fact that performance with interleaved harmonics was similar with and without modest delays suggests that representations of the f0 are initially available in parallel with representations of the spectrum, with task demands determining which is used in the service of behavior. As time passes the high-fidelity representation of the spectrum appears to degrade, and listeners switch to more exclusively using a representation of the f0.",

Consistent with this idea, listeners readily describe what they hear in the Inharmonic conditions of our experiments as a pitch change, as though the consistent shift in the spectrum is interpreted as a change in the f0.

But previous studies examining effects of musicianship on pitch discrimination used either pure tone or harmonic tone stimuli, and thus do not differentiate between representations of the f0 vs. the spectrum. We found consistent overall pitch discrimination advantages for musicians compared to non-musicians ( Supplementary Figures 1-3 ), but found no evidence that this benefit was specific to f0 representations: musicianship did not interact with the effects of inharmonicity or inter-stimulus delay. It is possible that more extreme variation in musical experience might show f0-specific effects. For instance, indigenous cultures in the Amazon appear to differ from Westerners in basic aspects of pitch (55) and harmony perception (56, 57) , raising the possibility that they might also differ in the extent of reliance on f0-based pitch. It is also possible that musicianship effects might be more evident if memory were additionally taxed with intervening distractor tones.",

After the survey, participants were presented with the second note (they could again listen to the note twice), and were asked to respond. Each participant heard the same stimulus type (Harmonic, Inharmonic, etc.) for each of the two trials. The order of the trials (with and without the intervening survey) was randomized across participants. Participants initiated the second trial by clicking a button after they entered their response for the first trial. For the trials with the demographic survey, we collected time stamps of when participants heard the first and second note in order to calculate the delay between notes. After completing the two trials and the survey, participants completed 40 up/down discrimination trials without a delay, half with Harmonic and half with Inharmonic tones. The pitch 30 difference in all trials was 1 semitone. The purpose of this task was to estimate baseline performance for each participant. We originally planned to use this to exclude poorly performing participants, but ended up using it as a comparison for the two main experimental trials, as described in the Results section.",

To approximate the number of participants needed we bootstrapped using data from Experiment 2, treating each trial as an independent participant and estimating data distributions using different numbers of sampled trials. For each possible sample size we computed the bootstrap distribution of the difference in performance between the Harmonic and Inharmonic conditions with a delay, as well as a null distribution obtained with conditions permuted across participants. We sought the sample size yielding an 80% chance of seeing a significant Harmonic-Inharmonic difference (i.e. where 95% of the bootstrap samples showed a difference exceeding the 97.5 th percentile of the null distribution), yielding a target sample size of 151 participants in each condition. We made no attempt to recruit equal numbers of musicians and non-musicians, as we did not plan to analyze those groups separately given the similar results across groups observed in the experiments we ran prior to this. Experiment 6, Online Participants: For the online portion of Experiment 6, we performed a power analysis by bootstrapping pilot data (an earlier version of Experiment 6 with slightly different stimuli). For each of a set of sample sizes we computed bootstrap distributions of the interaction term (difference of differences between the conditions being compared, Harmonic/Inharmonic and Interleaved-Harmonic), as well as null distributions obtained by permuting conditions across participants. We found that a sample size of 154 yielded a 90% chance of seeing the interaction present in our pilot data at a p<.05 significance level.

Inharmonic thresholds were indistinguishable from Harmonic thresholds without a delay (Z=1.28, p=.20), but were higher when there was a delay between sounds (Z=-8.83, p<.0001). This produced a significant interaction between effects of tone type and delay (F(1,159)=80.84, p<.0001, hp 2 =.34).

These results suggest that similar representations are used to discriminate pure and harmonic complex tones. In addition the correlations between the Pure Tone condition and the Inharmonic and Interleaved Harmonic conditions showed a similar pattern to that for the Harmonic condition, producing a significant interaction between the conditions being compared and the effect of delay (difference of differences between correlations with and without a delay = 0.32, p<.05).",

Of the total 801 participants, 383 reported some form of musical training, and 171 of those reported greater than four years of training (mean=13.7 years, S.D.=11.9 years). Experiment 6: 10 participants were recruited for the in-lab baseline for Experiment 6 (5 female, mean age=34.1, S.D.=13.8, 6 had over 4 years of musical training, mean=18.3 years, S.D.=7.8 years). 450 participants were recruited for the online component of Experiment 6. 290 were removed from analysis because their average threshold (across all 5 conditions) on the first run of the nodelay trials was greater than the in-lab average for those same conditions (2.47%). The remaining set of 160 participants (71 female, mean age=25.3 years, S.D.=9.1 years) included 110 who reported some form of musical training, and 72 participants who reported greater than four years of musical training (mean=10.9 years, S.D.=6.9 years).",
