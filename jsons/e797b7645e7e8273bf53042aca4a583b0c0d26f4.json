Clinically, it is characterized by fever, headache, muscular soreness, fatigue, dry cough rarely with phlegm, and diarrhea. Most patients experience accompanying pneumonia. In severe cases, the conditions may develop into acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or even multiple organ failure that causes death. In China, SARS has been legally listed as one of the class B infectious diseases but is managed as class A infectious diseases, like anthrax and human infection of avian infl uenza.",

Its diameter is commonly 60-120 mm, with radially arranged petal or cilium-like protrusions on its envelope. The protrusion is about 20 mm in length or longer with a narrow base and with a crown-like appearance resembling the classic coronavirus. The viral envelope mainly includes three types of glycoproteins: spike protein (S protein), membrane protein (M protein), and envelope protein (E protein). In some viral strains, hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE protein) can also be found. S protein is a baseball-shaped glycoprotein protruding out of the envelope, which plays a key role in the binding of virus to the surface receptor of the host cells and in mediating membrane fusion into the host cells. It is also the main antigen protein of coronavirus. M protein is a transmembrane protein, which plays an important role in the formation of the virus envelope and budding. E protein is a relatively small protein mainly scattering at the virus envelope. The categorization of coronavirus and its structural pattern are illustrated in Figs. 20.1 and 20.2 .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is pantropic to human tissues, but its pathogenesis still remains elusive. It gains its access into the human body via the respiratory tract and replicates at the epithelium of respiratory mucosa. Then they are released into blood fl ow to cause viremia, with following invasion into various organs and tissues. And the virus mainly invades the lungs and immune system, with type I alveolar epithelial cells and lymphocytes possibly as its target cells. By immunological assays, the specifi c antibody against SARS-CoV is detected in the serum, while SARS-CoV expresses M protein, N protein, S protein, and E protein to play its important pathogenic role. Clinically, SARS is characterized by acute lung infl ammation and acute lung injury, with 5-10 % of cases complicated by ARDS and MODS. And the conditions of 90 % of such patients are self-limited. Lung infl ammation caused by T lymphocytes is clinically parallel to its prognosis. By autopsy, pulmonary interstitial exudation, transudative infl ammation, and alveolar injury are found. The germinal center of a lymph node is absent, and the count of lymphocytes decreases. Systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS) involves the alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells to cause infl ammatory congestion, further inducing large quantities of exudates of serous fl uid and fi brinogen. The exudated fi brinogen agglutinates into cellulose, together with necrotic alveolar epithelial debris, to form hyaline membrane. The activated macrophages and lymphocytes can release cytokines and free radicals, which further increase the permeability of alveolar capillaries and induce the proliferation of fi broblasts. During the interaction of viruses with immune cells that infi ltrate into the lung tissues, the host immune cells (including macrophages, neutrophils, etc.) overproduce free radical molecules, such as oxygen radicals (O \u2212 2 ), nitric oxide radicals (NO), and its derivatives (ROS). Thus the infected cells and tissues are damaged.",

These pathological changes can be observed on autopsy specimen and biopsy specimen collected by bronchofi berscopy. Some proliferated alveolar epithelium fuses into each other to form zygote-like multinucleated giant cells. In the proliferated alveolar epithelium and the cytoplasm of exudated monocyte, viral inclusion bodies can be observed ( Fig. 20.4 ) . Along with progress of the condition, in cases with an illness course exceeding 3 weeks, organization of intra-alveolar exudates and hyaline membrane as well as hyperplasia of fi broblasts in alveolar septum can be observed. Both of them constantly integrate to cause alveolar occlusion and atrophy, with consequent lung consolidation.
