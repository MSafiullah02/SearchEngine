The classification of these antigens has been changed several times in the past; the current state according to the ISBT is listed in Table 1 . Structurally, GSLs are composed of a lipophilic part containing a long chain fatty acid and a sphingosine anchored in the plasma membrane, and a hydrophilic glycan head group (Fig. 1 ). Starting from lactosylceramide either Pk antigen (globotriaosylceramide, CD77) is synthesized via the action of the A4GALT gene-encoded galactosyltransferase leading to the globo-series GSL pathway, or P1 antigen is synthesized via the action of the same enzyme following two other (non-BG-related) glycosyltransferases generating neolacto-series GSL (Fig. 3 ). For P antigen production an active B3GALNT1-gene is required. structures of the globo-and (neo)lacto-series GSLs act as precursors for GSL-attached ABO, Le and H/Se epitopes, as indicated in Fig. 3 . If a null-allele of either A4GALT or B3GALNT1 is apparent (in very rare cases), globo-GSLs cannot be produced [52] . Furthermore, a rare variant of the A4GALT enzyme is linked to the expression of NOR antigens [53] . The FORS1 antigen was found in individuals with an activated GBGT gene, which is normally not active in humans, but in some nonprimate animals [27] . Except for P1 antigen, which is RBC-specific, the expression of the other related antigens is common to many tissues and cell types, and expression levels can vary during cell cycle and differentiation [12] .

However, genetic diversity with the ~300 alleles found for the ABO locus and ~50 alleles for the H, Se, and Le loci each [25] , together with zygosity gives rise to an enormous variation of the levels of antigen expression including weak phenotypes leading to blood grouping discrepancies [56, 57] . Moreover, in pregnant women, individuals with different hematologic disorders, and especially in newborns, weak expression of histo-BG antigens on RBCs has been reported [57, 58] . The agedependency of ABO antigen expression on RBCs is connected to the expression of I antigen, which is the major precursor of ABO structures on RBCs [12] . I antigen expression in RBCs is negligible at birth and reaches the full adult level by the age of 18 months [59] , giving an example of the oncodevelopmental nature of histo-BG antigen expression [33] . The expression levels of ABO/Se and Le antigens can also vary tremendously within an adult individual over time [60] . Regulatory mechanisms of histo-BG-related glycogene expression, such as microRNA or transcription factor expression, are now being studied [38, 61] .",

This is demonstrated by the close relationships between ABO/Se and Le BGs as well as P1PK, GLOB and FORS, in addition to their precursor chains Ii and T/Tn ( Fig. 2A-D) . Another important modification, which is, however, not directly related to blood groups, is alpha2,3-sialylation of the terminal galactose prior to the action of a FUT on type 1 or 2 chains producing sialyl-Le a and sialyl-Le x antigens, respectively (Fig. 4) . These combined histo-BG antigens are recognized for their role in the context of cancer as is discussed below. Interestingly, sialyltransferases also compete with FUTs for the same substrates, and can therefore have an impact on the expression levels of the inter-connected ABO and Le glycan BG antigens [12] . The different levels of substrate specificities have an additional impact on the overall complexity of the biosynthetic network of histo-BG glycosyltransferases: Some antigens can be synthesized by more than one en- histo-BG glycans an intriguing topic in the field of personalized medicine as discussed in the following paragraphs. In Table 2 the major conclusions from selected epidemiological studies reporting on associations between different diseases and ABO, Le and Se histo-BGs are summarized.",

Since glycans are known for their predominant role as recognition molecules, in particular, in infection, the association of glycan histo-BG polymorphisms with various infectious diseases is not surprising. Many vertebrate species have maintained a functional AB gene, however, in humans roughly half of the population has O genotype resulting in a non-functional A/B enzyme. ABO polymorphism has been linked to evolutionary adaptation as defense against inter-and intra-species infections, since individuals produce antibodies against the non-self AB antigens after the exposure to these antigens originating from e.g. pathogens [62] . Masking of pathogen adhesion glycotopes by other glycans is another defense mechanism suggested [63] . Whereas microbial attachment sites on epithelial surfaces can support colonization, histo-BG antigens on soluble glycans such as mucins or free oligosaccharides from human milk may serve as decoy receptors in pathogen defense [64] [65] [66] (Fig. 1 Glycan epitopes including histo-BGs have an important role in host-pathogen interactions, since glycans act as recognition sites for bacterial adhesins, and secondly, pathogens express surface epitopes to mimic those of the host to evade immune response, as proposed for Helicobacter pylori Le antigens [14] . Remarkably, H. pylori is able to bind to the same antigenic structures on the host's epithelial surface [91] . H. pylori is present in half of the world population and chronic infection is linked to gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer with a high degree of heterogeneity in disease phenotypes [92] . The bacterium is able to attach only to Le b antigen without additional A or B epitopes, and has therefore been proposed to be linked to BG O [91] . However, clinical data on the association of H.",

Pk antigen also binds to adhesin P from Streptococcus suis, a pig pathogen that can cause meningitis in humans [105] . Various studies have demonstrated the stimulation of antibody titers against BG antigens under different conditions of bacterial exposure, thus, supporting the hypothesis of an immunologic defense function of BG antigen (non-)expression [12] . Another indication for the implication of ABO histo-BGs in immunological processes was given by the findings that the efficacy and the vibriocidal antibody response of cholera vaccines was lower in BG O compared to BG A individuals [106, 107] . Therefore, exploring the role of anti-BG antibody response and protection following specific vaccinations is of great interest, as has been shown in a systems biology approach using glycan microarray analysis of immunoglobulin G preparations from different healthy populations [108] . The pooled antibody preparations bound to various self-antigen ligands including especially GLOB, FORS1, Le y , BG A1 and BG B epitopes, but also H2 and sialyl-Le a in some cases. The authors suggested a protective role for these self-antibodies by blocking bacterial attachment sites if released on epithelial surfaces.",

In addition, a certain rotavirus genotype, P [11] that mainly infects neonates, was found to attach specifically to saliva from neonates and infants, but not adults, due to high expression of polylactosamines, i.e. the i antigen [109] . Different viral proteins from selected rotaviral genotypes were found to bind to either i epitopes or their type 1 isomers with or without internal Le x of human milk oligosaccharides in a strain-and viral protein-dependent manner [64] . Consequently, infectivity seems to be highly dependent on the virus genotype in interaction with the host ancestry/ethnicity and different histo-BGs. For norovirus, multivalent virus-like particle vaccines have therefore been proposed representing a broad set of viral genotypes and strains [110] . Interestingly, anti-histo-BG, but not immunoglobulin G or total antibody titers prior to the challenge with norovirus were positively correlated with protection against infection in placebo-recipients, while in vaccinees the frequency of severe disease was lower with higher pre-challenge anti-histo-BG antibody titers [111] . For the development of efficient vaccines against norovirus and rotavirus, individualized approaches addressing all the relevant factors such as virus genotype, the specific particles and adjuvants used in the vaccine, and their interaction with the histo-BG antigens and anti-histo-BG antibodies of the recipients will be of particular interest in the future.",

This switch has furthermore been linked to enhanced cellular motility and poor prognosis [117] . The A/B expression loss goes along with a higher abundance of the precursor structure I antigen in carcinomas from secretors, whereas cancerous tissue from non-secretors experiences a lower I antigen expression [121] . Moreover, an increased distribution of H antigen throughout all the layers of malignant tissue as compared to a more restricted pattern in normal mucosa has been found [126, 128] . Analogously, alpha1,2-FUT activity from both Se-and H-gene encoded enzymes were higher in rectal carcinomas than in normal tissue [129] . Interestingly, Se/H-antigens were found in cecal tumors from Seas well as non-Se patients, while being absent in normal tissues of non-secretors. A very recent in- vestigation of cyst fluid and tissue from ovarian tumors has shown remarkable differences in ABO BG antigen expression between different tumor stages and subtypes [130] . By using mass spectrometry average compositions of fucosylation (ABO and Le antigens) and sialylation of mucin-type glycans, the authors were able to distinguish three groups of samples: i) low-grade, low malignant potential carcinomas and benign mucinous, ii) all serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas, and iii) serous benign samples. Again, non-secretor samples were exceptions due to a genetically determined lower expression of BG epitopes on epithelia.",

Moreover, perturbations in gut microbiota metabolism and other factors of the host-microbial environment in non-secretors and FUT2 heterozygous individuals with Crohn's disease have been reported [135] . Fucosylation in the gut, which is primarily mediated by FUT2 and can be induced by certain gut bacteria via yet unknown mechanisms, has a central role in the host-microbe symbiosys and can suppress pathogens [136] . Interestingly, host fucose utilization by specific microbes is only down-regulated in non-Se mice if fed a glucoserich, polysaccharide-deficient diet, demonstrating an intense interaction between host genetics, diet and gut microbiome [137] . Notably, gastrointestinal malignancies, in particular colorectal cancer, have also been linked to gut microbiota composition [138] . Intriguingly, a previously unrecognized regulatory role of histo-BG antigens in inflammatory adhesion processes has been proposed due to a strong correlation of the ABO locus with plasma concentrations of the soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (sICAM-1) [139] . Moreover, the ABO locus was associated with diabetes type 2 and E-selectin levels, besides sICAM-1 levels [140] . In addition, a lower risk of cardiovascular and associated diseases has been found for BG O individuals and linked to BG antigens on platelet glycoconjugates, as recently reviewed [74] . Interestingly, BG O individuals have lower levels of the blood clotting factors von Willebrand and FVIII due to their shorter plasma half-life [141] .",

As briefly demonstrated by the example of the interaction of an individual's Se status and gut microbiota, histo-BGs might play a significant role already at the early stage of disease prevention. Another example is the various histo-BG glycans in human milk, which are suggested to provide double protection to the breastfed child via their prebiotic and their antimicrobial activity in the gut [145] . The decoy function of milk glycans, in particular the highly abundant free oligosaccharides and mucin glycans, offers a yet underexamined possibility for a novel preventive and also therapeutic antibiotic strategy. Emerging high-throughput analytical technologies such as glycan microarrays, multiplexed capillary electrophoresis, or matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) will pave the way for the discovery of such novel bioactive compounds [64, 65, 146, 147] .",

Therefore, glycomic, together with glycoproteomic and glycolipidomic technologies should be further refined to allow unambiguous (isomer-specific) structural characterization and optimally quantitation of histo-BG glycans that have high potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in the context of both infectious and communicable diseases. Currently applied glyco-analytical techniques in the field of biomarker discovery from cancer tissues are presented in [150] . Major progress in glycomic approaches distinguishing linkages and/or different monosaccharide species has been made recently in the field of N-and O-glycomics [151, 152] . However, glycomics of histo-BGs has been neglected in the last years except for some few, rather targeted approaches [153] [154] [155] . In a very recent study traditional, targeted techniques in combination with liquid-chromatography-MS/MS were successfully applied showing great potential of mucin-type histo-BG glycans for ovarian tumor staging and classification not only from tissues, but also from cystic fluid [130] . Glycomic approaches on only minute amounts of preferably non-invasively acquired patient samples, such as saliva, tears, milk, urine, or feces [66, [156] [157] [158] [159] , will be of particular use in the context of early diagnosis and population-wide screening.",

Interestingly, the spatial organization of ABO antigen patches on RBCs from A, B, and O individuals was shown to differ in BG-specific manner resulting in higher or lower binding of sialic acid-binding proteins (Siglecs) to sialic acid-rich clusters that are co-expressed nearby the ABH regions [160] . The authors claimed having found a novel function of ABH antigens, i.e. as indirect stabilizers of other glycan-protein interactions. Further research is warranted to reveal the function relevance of such multi-compound complexes involving the concerted binding of glycans in a multivalent manner.",
