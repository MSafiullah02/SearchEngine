Avoiding intubation is paramount to the management of oncologic patients with ARF. The risks associated with intubation are pronounced in the immunocompromised and oncologic population. These risks include numerous infectious, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and neurologic complications. Oncologic patients may present with a greater frequency of frailty at the time of critical illness, a higher likelihood of succumbing to aggressive or drug-resistant pathogens or they may experience a blunted or dysregulated host response [4] [5] [6] . As such, patients who progress to require invasive mechanical ventilation are subject to increased mortality compared to the general ICU population [7] .",

Earlier studies in immunocompromised patients receiving NIV compared to COT suggested a reduced need for intubation [6, 8] . This resulted in adoption of NIV as a noninvasive strategy to support oncologic patients in an attempt to prevent intubation. However, these results have been called into question in recent years [9] . Furthermore, we have recently seen the development of HFNC with promising preliminary results across the general ICU population. It is unclear whether these promising results with HFNC translate to the oncologic population. With the goal to reserve intubation in those failing noninvasive oxygenation strategies, there remains a need to better understand these therapies in this unique population.",

Disease associated causes of respiratory failure include tumor infiltration into the airway, pulmonary leukostasis, leukemic infiltrates, and malignant pleural effusions among others. Treatment-associated toxicities may occur early during treatment (tumor lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, all-transretinoic acid differentiation syndrome), at the height of treatment effect (neutropenicassociated infectious complications), during recovery (neutrophil reconstitution or engraftment syndrome associated with ARDS), or as a late toxicity (cardiomyopathy, pulmonary pneumonitis). These causes are unique to the oncologic population. While infectious etiologies remain the most common culprit, a higher proportion of noninfectious causes are noted in this population. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the differential is imperative to guide early recognition, anticipation of deterioration, and institution of appropriate supportive care and treatment. Recognizing and projecting the reversibility of the underlying cause is an important factor in deciding on the noninvasive or invasive modality one may choose as first line.",

In the setting of respiratory distress, the inspiratory flow rate of dyspneic patients often greatly exceeds the upper limit of flow rates delivered by these conventional systems and a significant entrainment of ambient air limits the delivery of the targeted FiO 2. As a result, oxygen delivery to the alveoli is the resultant fractions of high FiO 2 at a fixed delivered rate and ambient air (0.21) at a rate determined by any excessive inspiratory flow generated by a patient in respiratory distress. The greater the entrainment of ambient air, the greater dilution of the alveolar FiO 2 . Furthermore, an additional shortcoming of COT is its lack of ability to provide any alveolar recruitment in the setting of a consolidated lung. Alveolar recruitment may result in a decreased need for excessive FiO 2 delivery through recruitment of additional alveoli to participate in gas exchange. In the absence of this recruitment, a patient on COT may be exposed to unnecessarily high concentrations of inspired oxygen to maintain a sufficient saturation. The resultant negative effect of a prolonged exposure to high oxygen delivery is potentially oxygen toxicity which has been found to be associated with an increased mortality [25] . While we conceptualize oxygen toxicity as having the greatest harm in those with excessive dissolved oxygen content leading to excessive reactive oxygen species, the local toxic effect of the administration of high oxygen concentration of inspired O 2 has also been described leading to tracheal and bronchial irritation, impaired mucociliary clearance and surfactant impairment, alterations in microbial flora in the upper airways and alveolar nitrogen washout leading to absorptive atelectasis. Therefore, in critically ill patients, NIV and HFNC may be more attractive options to temporize or reverse acute respiratory failure given some mechanisms described below. ",

It can both decrease right-ventricular afterload (through improving oxygenation and reversing hypoxic vasoconstriction/decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance) or increase right-ventricular afterload in the setting of alveolar overdistension if excessive PEEP were applied.

This phenomenon underscores the need for adequate volume repletion in patients not in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In contrast, those patients with reduced ventricular function and signs of cardiogenic induced hydrostatic pulmonary edema can greatly benefit from NIV. The physiologic impact of reducing right-ventricular preload and afterload reducing the left ventricle is ideal in the setting of congestive heart failure and an impaired left ventricle.

Contraindications may include, but are not limited to, cardiopulmonary arrest, head and neck surgery, upper airway obstruction, fresh esophageal anastomosis, bowel obstruction, hemoptysis, and untreated pneumothorax. Another important concern with NIV is that there is a challenge in measuring the delivered tidal volumes, which, when greater than 6-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight, may precipitate ventilator-associated lung injury [32, 33] . NIV is a modality that has the greatest evidence in rapidly reversible conditions (congestive heart failure, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); however, in more protracted conditions (i.e., pneumonia, checkpoint-associated pulmonary toxicities), NIV may impair one's ability to proceed with other routine care-objectives, i.e., nutrition, mobility, bronchoscopy, calling into questions its role in longer term management of more complex patients.

The majority of these patients were immunocompromised secondary to hematologic malignancies. NIV was applied for a median of 9 h per day in the first 24 h. Of note, the control arm had a very high mortality with an increased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. These results were intriguing to many and led to an increased application of NIV for oncologic patients with ARF [3, 45] . Antonelli and colleagues conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a similar question in 40 solid organ transplantation and found a similar reduction in invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality [8] . However, this study was noted to have a high proportion of patients with hydrostatic pulmonary edema as the primary etiology of ARFfor which there is a strong, established evidence base. Squadrone and colleagues randomized 40 patients with hematologic malignancies with bilateral infiltrations, tachypnea, and mild hypoxia (saturation <90% on room air) to CPAP or COT as a means to prevent the development of acute lung injury and need for ICU admission [47] .

Rates of NIV success have varied from reports across different institutions which may reflect important differences in patient selection and practice. Accurate identification of those who are at highest risk of NIV failure versus success is paramount to potentially defining any role for NIV in the setting of ARDS for oncologic patients. Datato-date is limited by its retrospective nature subjecting it to selection biasthose who experience NIV failure are patients that the intensivist may not be keen to intubate given poor overall prognostic factors and therefore turned to NIV first line. Until further research clarifies its role in ARDS in oncologic patients, it should be reserved for those patients in which one suspects underlying hydrostatic pulmonary edema as a plausible cause of ARF or contributor, or be applied for a time limited trial (1 or 4 h) in those with a low severity of illness with an early evaluation of physiologic improvement (decrease in respiratory rate, drop in FiO 2 requirements - Fig. 3 ). In the study by Rathi and colleagues, they evaluated improvement in respiratory rate, Glasgow coma score, oxygenation parameters, and acid-base status as markers of NIV success (and thus continuation) or NIV failure (potential indication to consider intubation) [16] . Frat and colleagues also evaluated factors associated with NIV failure. At 1 h following initiation, a persistent PaO 2 / FiO 2 < 200 and tidal volumes greater than 9 mL/ kg of predicted body weight were independently associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality [52] . It would be important that the intensivist considers (1) tidal volumes generated, (2) need for other invasive tests or imaging (CT/fiberoptic bronchoscopy), and (3) immediate response to its application with a projected rapid wean-off of NIV (i.e., drop in respiratory rate/oxygenation response). Furthermore, Patel and colleagues recently evaluated the interface of helmet versus face mask for NIV and found a decreased need for invasive mechanical ventilation and morality [27] . These findings are intriguing for which its role needs to be further elucidated in this population compared to alternative noninvasive oxygen strategies outlined below.",

Eight studies compared HFNC to an oxygen therapy control (NIV or COT). Oncologic diagnosis or treatment associated effect was the leading cause of immunosuppression with a predominance of hematologic malignancy (9/11 studies). HFNC was initiated in the emergency department, acute care ward, or intensive care unit with the latter being the most common site of initiation. Various indications for the application of HFNC existed ranging from tachypnea or hypoxia on room air to more formalized PaO 2 /FiO 2 thresholds. The median PaO 2 /FiO 2 across the studies was 145 (IQR 115-175). The need for invasive mechanical ventilation, evaluated at 28-day intubation or hospital discharge, was 46% (IQR 25-67%). The longest follow-up mortality time points are reported in Table 3 with a median mortality of 36% (IQR 14-58%).",

These findings are primarily meant to be exploratory given the heterogeneous nature of the populations and low quality of evidence (observational studies, post hoc analyses of RCTs). Most recently, Azoulay and colleagues performed the largest RCT to date of immunocompromised patients with ARF and randomized the approximately 800 patients to COT or HFNC [67] . These patients were mainly immunocompromised secondary to hematologic malignancy or its treatments. The primary outcome of 28-day survival was not different between the two groups (35.6% HFNC vs. 36.1% COT), nor were a number of secondary outcomes including intubation rates, ICU and hospital length of stay, or ICU-related complications. This trial therefore suggests that HFNC in all immunocompromised patients may not be better than COT and further subgroups of HFNC \"responders\" must be sought. Future directions would necessitate larger, randomized controlled trials specifically enrolling oncologic patients comparing COT, NIV, and HFNC head-to-head. In addition, there could exist a differential impact across varying severities and indications for ARF.",

Until further research is available, individual patient characteristics, severity of illness, and early response to each modality is imperative to guide selection of which strategy is most applicable. Most importantly, the physician needs to pay meticulous attention to the rapidity of reversibility of the underlying condition and reevaluate the impact of the strategy chosen at an early time points (e.g., 1 and 4 h). An improved physiologic response to the modality of choice has been consistently found to be associated with success. While HFNC is a unique oxygen delivery modality that holds theoretical promise for the treatment of ARF in oncologic patients, the current body of literature demonstrates that there is a paucity of high-quality data in this specific population to guide evidence-based therapy. This chapter underscores the need for further research with clinical and physiological studies, including larger randomized controlled trials specifically of oncologic patients to more clearly elucidate the potential benefits of one modality over another.",

However, the signal of benefit has not been consistent across all studies. A Cochrane review by Corley and colleagues evaluated the use of HFNC compared to COT or NIV for ARF or postextubation across 11 RCTs[53]. HFNC compared to COT was not associated with lower rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (reported in six studies) or mortality (reported in three studies). Confidence in the results using GRADE criteria[54] was downgraded to low given the risk of bias across these studies and different participant indications. Data comparing HFNC to NIV was not pooled given the low number of studies and their heterogeneity.",
