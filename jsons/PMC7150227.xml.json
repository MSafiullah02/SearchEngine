In 2002, Waihenya et al. (2002) evaluated the efficacy of the Aloe secundiflora crude extract on experimentally NDV-infected chicken. Four-month-old chickens, free of NDV antibodies, were used. Results showed that there were no significant differences in the final mortality rates between the treated and untreated chickens. Apparently, the survival of the infected chicken depended mainly on the antibody levels, on which the aloe has no significant effect. The aloe, however, could be a potential candidate on the management rather than the treatment of NDV. Abd-Alla et al. (2012) used various parts of Aloe hijazensis against hemagglutinating viruses such as NDV, avian influenza virus type-1, and egg-drop syndrome virus (EDSV) in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. They reported that the flowers and leaves of A. hijazensis showed relatively higher antiviral activity than other parts of the plant.",

This suggested that the extract demonstrated anti-NDV activity.",

Various parts of the plant were extracted using DMSO and co-incubated with NDV prior to injecting into the embryonated eggs. At concentrations of 250 and 500 \u03bcg/mL, the survivability of the embryo has greatly improved and the hemagglutinin (HA) titer of these embryonated eggs were substantially reduced. The authors further investigated the efficacy of resinous extracts against NDV in chicken (Bakari et al., 2013). The extracts, at various concentrations, were given to the chicken before the challenge (prophylactic effect) or after the challenge (therapeutic effect). Results showed significant reduction in clinical symptoms or severity as well as in antibody titers in the chicken resulting to lower mortality rate. These findings indicate that the resinous extract has strong antiviral activity against NDV in chicken.\n",

(2005) showed that the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin (EGC) could inhibit various stages of AIV replication. EGCG and ECG effectively inhibit the attachment of virus by interacting with the hemagglutination protein. Kim et al. (2013) reported similar results where they showed that EGCG did not affect the binding of the protein to receptors, but inhibited the hemifusion event between virus and the cellular membrane. In addition, catechins were found to suppress the RNA synthesis by inhibiting the endonuclease activity of AIV RNA polymerase (Song et al., 2005, Kuzuhara et al., 2009). Catechins also inhibit the release of the virus by interacting with the neuraminidase protein (Song et al., 2005). The authors proposed that the 3-galloyl group of the catechin skeleton might play an important role on the antiviral activity. Lee et al. (2012b) investigated the potential of antiinfluenza virus activity of green tea by-products against AIV infection in chicken. Antiviral effects, in a dose-dependent manner, were observed when the chickens were fed with 10 g/kg of feed. Significant reduction in the number of SPF chickens that shed AIV in cecal tonsil after the virus challenge was also observed. The authors suggested that green tea byproduct extract inhibits AIV effectively in the chicken intestines.",

Powdered liquorice root is an effective expectorant to promote the secretions of sputum by the air passages and has been used to treat cough since ancient times. The roots of the plant contain many phenolic and active compounds particularly glycyrrhizinic acid, which exhibits antiviral, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-modulating properties (Kapil and Sharma, 1997). These properties allow it to be an important supplement for flu prevention. Animal studies have revealed that liquorice is capable of stopping virus replication (Nose et al., 1998, Curreli et al., 2005). One study found that liquorice root protects cells from the infection of influenza A virus, and in already infected cells, causing a drastic reduction in the number infected cells (Wagner and Jurcic, 2002).",

The plant is also used in dyspepsia and various types of fever. Traditional medicine suggested that mixing one foot long of the Giloy herb and seven leaves of Tulsicould effectively prevent infection of swine flu (Shah and Krishnamurthy, 2013). Though the recipe was not scientifically established, compound and elemental analysis indicated that Guduchi contains various diterpene compounds, including tinosporone, tinosporic acid, syringen, berberine, giloin as well as polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan polysaccharide (Subhose et al., 2005, Sanchez-Lamar et al., 1999). These compounds possess adaptogenic and immunomodulating properties. Studies showed that Guduchi extract could cause a significant increase in IgG antibodies in serum, along with macrophage activation (Fortunatov, 1952), besides promotions of humoral immunity and stimulation of cell mediated immunity (Winston and Maimes, 2007). The plant has immense potential for use against novel H1N1 flu since it is a potent immunostimulant.",

A. indica has traditionally been used as an antiviral, and animal and laboratory research has shown promising results. While researchers have still not pinpointed the exact mode of action of neem phytoconstituents, there is some evidence to show that they interfere with viral reproduction, thus minimizing the impact of viral infections (Sahoo, 2015).

Traditional medicine practitioners often used ginger to boost the body's immunity level, relief gastrointestinal illness, cure cough and flu, antinausea, antiinflammatory, and also aid digestion. The characteristic odor and flavor of the ginger root comes from the mixture of zingerone, shogaols and gingerols, and volatile oils. Ginger contains gingerol, a pungent ingredient of ginger volatile oil with sulphur-containing compounds (allicin, alliin, and ajoene), and enzymes (allinase, peroxidase, and myrosinase), which exhibited antibiotic properties (Shah and Krishnamurthy, 2013). The allicins have fibrinolytic activity that reduces platelet aggregation by inhibiting prostaglandin E2. Compounds in ginger also increase levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which stimulate inflammatory reactions triggered by viral infections. Bioactive components analysis of ginger suggested that various antiinfluenza agents are presented in ginger including TNF-\u03b1, an antiinfluenza cytokine (Chopra and Nayar, 1956). Further animal trial showed similar findings, where gingerols from ginger extract is able to increase the motility of the gastrointestinal tract and have strong antimicrobial properties (Shah and Krishnamurthy, 2013).",

B. falcatum has been used in Chinese medicine for over 2000 years as a \u201cliver tonic.\u201d B. falcatum is commonly prescribed by both Chinese and Japanese traditional medicine doctors for inflammatory and infectious diseases. Despite the precise mechanism of action remains unclear, B. falcatum has been found to possess antiinflammatory and antiviral properties (Lee et al., 2012a). Recent study by Yang et al. (2017) reported that several major triterpenoid saponins were identified in B. falcatum extract, including saikosaponin A (SSA) and saikosaponin D (SSD). These active components are reported to impart immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer effects (Na-Bangchang and Karbwang, 2014). Furthermore, it has been shown that SSD could exhibit an antiproliferative effect in activated T-lymphocyte, via suppression of NF-\u03baB, NF-AT, and AP-1 signaling (Tundis et al., 2009). Many studies have recently focused on the use of Chinese herbal medicines to treat or prevent PCV2-induced health disorders (Sun et al., 2016). Existing data showed that B. falcatum could reduce PCV2-induced pathological effects, which can cause an imbalance in a variety of protein levels and cell numbers through modulating the content of immunoglobulin as well as hemoglobin (HGB) (Darwich et al., 2003, Pejsak et al., 2011, Sipos et al., 2004).",

A recent report showed icariin in E. koreanum stimulates angiogenesis (Chung et al., 2008). Other researcher reported that flavonoids and icariin of E. koreanum Nakai improved the development of osteoblast (Zhang et al., 2008). Also, icariside II was found to induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells (Lee et al., 2009). But, the antiviral effect of E. koreanum was not reported until recently (Cho et al., 2012). Cho et al. (2012) demonstrated that water extract of E. koreanum exerts a potent antiviral activity on PED virus through both in vitro and in vivo animal models. Despite the underlying mechanism of E. koreanum remained unknown; test result suggested that E. koreanum exerts antiviral effect through modulating immune responses such as macrophage and lymphocyte stimulation.",

Hayashi et al. (2000)reported that TS could inactivate human type A and B influenza virus, yet the underlying antiviral mechanisms remain unknown. A recent study investigated the inhibitory effects of TS on PRRSV and its underlying mechanisms of action using an in vitro model system (Li et al., 2015). PRRSV infection always results in persistent transmission and secondary infection. Li et al. (2015) demonstrates that TS can effectively inhibit PRRSV replication through multiple ways, including directly inactivating the virus or blocking the virus entry into the cells, and indirectly through the modulation of Poly (A)-binding protein (PABP). Such unique properties of TS might reduce the opportunity of development of drug-resistant strains.",

On the other hand, in vivo study showed it was capable of killing FMD virus with no toxicity effects on mice (Fu et al., 2014).

Based on the research findings presented, in addition to being a safer and economical alternative to drugs, herbal constituents showed positive responses in animals, which suggest that it may suppress viral replication and reduce the clinical signs of viral diseases in different productive animals. Although the usage of herbs have shown profound effects in reducing viral infections, total elimination is dependent on good management practice and biosecurity of the farms.",
