In hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients, hMPV can cause life-threatening disease. Englund and colleagues described a case series in which the hMPV detection rate by RT-PCR was about 26% among symptomatic patients, and 80% of hMPV-positive patients died from severe infection [63] . Furthermore, in stem-cell transplant recipients, viral shedding and persistence may be prolonged compared to otherwise healthy individuals and may be accompanied by severe infection characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [50, 63] . Until now, ribavirin has been the only antiviral agent used to treat severe hMPV infections [28, 85, 93, 165] . Ribavirin was tested in a mouse model and used successfully in two published clinical cases. To date, no other antivirals or vaccines are available.",

Two new viruses classified as HBoV2 and HBoV3 were discovered recently. HBoV2 has 75% similarity to HBoV, compared to only 18% for HBoV3 and HBoV2 [12, 100] .

The main genome body containing the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding viral proteins has been sequenced and shown to be 5,309 nt in length [115] . The entire genome length is predicted to be about 6,000 nt [8, 9] . Experiments to directly sequence the virus genome failed and led to faulty data [9, 27] . HBoV is thought to have palindromic hairpin structures flanking the terminal ends, similar to related Parvoviridae (e.g., BPV and CnMV). The function of the terminal folds is not fully understood, but it is thought that they act as primers in viral replication and are important for packaging [101] . Until now, it was not possible to decipher the unknown sequences. Attempts to amplify the regions encoding specific enzymes did not reveal the nucleotide sequence [9] . An undetected protein covalent or other protein modification on the HBoV genome may explain this failure, as other parvoviruses (B19, MVM, and H1) possess protein covalents attached to their genomes [39, 51, 168] . Recent findings reveal that the majority (87.5%) of the ssDNA strands packed in the capsid are of negative polarity, independent from their viral subtypes [27] . The genomic composition is as yet unconfirmed, and so far three ORFs have been identified, similar to BPV and CnMV. One of these ORFs encodes for the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, whereas the other two encode for non-structural proteins. The VP2 gene sequence is nested within the VP1 gene sequence. The VP1 sequence, compared to VP2, contains a unique terminal sequence, VP1u [163] , which may be required for HBoV genome transfer to the nucleus for replication [236] . The HBoV capsid is composed of 60 proteins, derived from the structural molecule VP1 and its derivative VP2 [9] . The functions of the non-structural proteins NS1 and NP-1 are still equivocal. NS1 may play a role in replication. It generally acts as an initiator protein (for parvoviruses), specifically controlling the process by which several concatemeric intermediates are processed by rolling-hairpin replication [15] . The role for NP-1, located in the middle ORF, is still unclear, but probably also involves parvovirus replication. The transmission route of HBoV is still unknown, but suggested tissue sites for replication are the respiratory and intestinal epithelia, as well as the lymphatic organs. Parvoviruses replicate only in proliferating cells, and the viral proteins are transcribed only during the S-phase. Recently, an in vitro replication system for HBoV using stratified human airway epithelium to imitate the human trachea was successfully established.",

            "text": "Symptoms associated with possible HBoV infection are wheezing, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [8, 12, 19, 31, 33, 41, 43, 44, 49, 97, 114, 118-121, 124, 126, 141, 176, 177, 179, 183, 195, 198, 203, 213, 219, 226, 235, 237, 239] . However, the presence of HBoV in the respiratory tract does not prove that the virus is the cause of infection. HBoV is often detected concomitantly with other respiratory viruses [41, 216, 226] , a fact that adds to the uncertainty regarding the pathogenic potential for HBoV [41, 66, 91, 97, 118, 124, 128, 136, 176, 200, 203, 213, 217, 226, 239] . The symptoms are identical in patients positive for HBoV alone or combined with another virus, but the viral load is higher in mono-infections than in coinfections. Asymptomatic patients can carry the virus. In one study, 43% of tested asymptomatic children were HBoV-positive. These patients were admitted for elective surgery, and the group undergoing mainly ear, nose, and throat surgery had the highest prevalence of asymptomatic HBoV infection [124] . These data suggested that HBoV may persist in the host in the tonsillar lymphoid tissue, contributing to tonsillar hyperplasia [126] . HBoV has been detected in patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection, but it is unclear whether the virus is only excreted in stool or is a cause of gastroenteritis. In these studies, HBoV was found concomitantly with a norovirus or other enteric viruses, and HBoV was not directly proven to be a cause of gastrointestinal infection. The virus in suspension in respiratory secretions may be simply swallowed and excreted in stool. The newly discovered HBoV2 and HBoV3 have both been detected in stool samples. HBoV2 was identified in a study involving stool sample screening in children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [12, 100, 179] , and HBoV2 and HBoV3 were detected in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis. More studies on the two new HBoV types are needed to gain a better understanding of their role in gastrointestinal infections. No evidence that HBoV2 and HBoV3 can infect gastrointestinal tissue exists to date. Furthermore, whether detection of these viruses in serum indicates viremia or infection of blood cells is unknown, because there are no currently established methods for detecting HBoV particles. The related parvovirus B19 can infect erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, but no HBoV DNA was detected in bone marrow samples from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive and -negative individuals, whereas B19 was present in both groups [76, 146] . So far, there is one published report of HBoV associated with severe pneumonia in a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient [172, 173] and one of HBoV infection in an adult with leukemia [109] . However, none of these patients had clinical symptoms different from those caused by other \"common cold\" pathogens, and no specific antiviral therapy was available.",

No seasonal variations have been described. HoBV occurs mainly in pediatric patients aged 6-24 months [4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 37, 40, 42, 44, 61, 74, 77, 86, 91, 95, 99, 103, 116, 127, 132, 143, 149, 158, 160, 162, 166, 167, 179, 187, 189, 194, 214, 219, 226, 235, 238] . Younger children may be protected by maternal antibodies [38] . HBoV-IgG can cross the placental barrier, but it is unclear whether HBoV can be transmitted from the mother to her fetus. Antibodies against HBoV have been found in about 94% of individuals older than 19 years of age [44] . At the moment, only two different genotypes of the single HBoV lineage are known. A simple verification test is available for rapidly differentiating between these two genotypes. Digestion of a 309-bp fragment of the VP1/VP2 gene with BstAPI endonuclease yields two fragments with genotype 1, but induces no cleavage with genotype 2 [54]. Three HBoV2 genotypes have been identified [5] , but no information is available for HBoV3.",

Patient samples were inoculated onto Rhesus monkey kidney cells (fRhk4) to look for cytopathic effects. Electron microscopy revealed the morphology of the virus and led to characterization of the virus family. Histopathological studies showed mild interstitial inflammation with scattered alveolar pneumocytes. In an immunofluorescence antibody assay, sera from patients had high titers of antibodies against the infected cells. A random RT-PCR assay generated DNA fragments of unknown origin, but with homology to viruses of the Coronaviridae family, and confirmed the results of electron microscopy. A few days later, these results were confirmed by two other groups [56, 108, 156] . SARS and its causative agent appeared unexpectedly and spread explosively. The infection was transmitted from palm civets to humans, although it has since been confirmed that bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Due to the fast mutation rate of RNA viruses and their resulting genotypic markers, the course of the infection could be reconstituted in great detail. In the early phase of the SARS near pandemic, the very first index patient fulfilling the subsequent WHO definition of SARS resided in Foshan near Guangzhou and was identified on November 16, 2002. One month later, the second case occurred, in Shenzhen, where a man who had regular contact with wild animals was infected and transmitted the disease to his family and to several staff members at the hospital where he was admitted. Similar cases were reported nearby. In January 2003, the second phase of the SARS outbreak started in Guangzhou. Several patients died, and patients were transferred to major hospitals, leading to nosocomial spread of the virus to other patients and health-care workers.",

Screening of 2,135 patients with respiratory tract infections identified 43 additional cases [79] . Of note, KIPyV was not named for the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm where it was detected.

Adenoviruses play a major role in solid-organ transplant recipients but occur less often in stem cell recipients [46, 62, 71, 92, 130, 131, 135], However, novel and more aggressive adenovirus strains may meet the definition for emerging pathogens and may play a future role in patients with hematological malignancies. Consequently, adenoviruses deserve attention. More specifically, shedding may be prolonged in high-risk patients, patient isolation may be required, and no antiviral therapy for adenoviruses is available so far [46, 62, 71, 92, 130, 131, 135].",
