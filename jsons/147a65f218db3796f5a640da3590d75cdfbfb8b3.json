            "text": "Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 9 , the quarantined individuals had more negative emotions like anxiety and anger which are consistent with the findings from isolated mice experiments. 10 Hu et al. found that the type of quarantine can affect the level of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. 11 Mass quarantine restrictions on non-emergency health services including psychiatric care may adversely affect the access of vulnerable populations to mental health care which cannot be provided by health professionals in isolation units and hospitals due to a lack of specialized training. 7, 12 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition characterized by heightened anxiety that can also occur in response to diseases outbreaks. The immediate increase of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among patients, healthcare workers, and general population following outbreaks of the SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika -had been studied longitudinally in order to evaluate the long-term consequences of these diseases' outbreaks. SARS survivors with PTSD experienced persistent psychological distress and diminished social functioning in the 4 years after SARS treatment. 13 Frontline healthcare workers of MERS in South Korea were found experiencing PTSS until 3 years after the outbreak with numbness and sleeping disorders in the high-risk group. 14 In Italy, 37% of a national survey respondents had PTSS during the 3rd and 4th weeks of lockdown measures -suggesting that monitoring of population's mental health should be a critical priority during pandemics. 15 Psychobehavioral surveillance is critical for public health response during communicable disease outbreaks because it informs risk awareness strategies targeting general populations and high-risk groups. 16 Perceived risk during communicable disease outbreaks motivates people to adopt protective behaviors to reduce any potential hazards of an emerging epidemic. 17 The relationship between fear and protective behaviors is not linear, but it can be explained by the inverted U-shaped Fear Drive Model of Janis which demonstrates that a moderate level of fear motivates people to adapt protective behavior but when this level is too high or too low, people are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. 18 Protective behaviors were found to be significantly influenced by the level of knowledge and use of social media during the outbreak of COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza, and to positively impact the epidemic week and viral serial interval. 16, 17, 19 Public awareness is a predictor variable which has been associated with both emotions and behaviors during the outbreaks of COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza. Knowledge of the mechanisms of infection transmission and common symptoms are usually found to be sufficient among public, however knowledge of prevention and care-seeking strategies may be distorted by misconceptions and inaccurate information. 20, 21 Infodemic in response to communicable diseases outbreak is an inevitable challenge for public health strategies which occurs as a tsunami of health-related information during early phases of the outbreak -making it challenging for laymen to act properly because of confusing, contradictory, or false information (i.e., fake news), therefore it should be contained in order to escalate behavioral change of public in a predicted manner. 22 Notably, the definition of \"high-risk\" groups does not always correlate between epidemiology and psychology. The high-risk groups for infection, disease progression and fatality are predicted to develop more anxious emotions and different patterns of behaviors based on their elevated perceived risk levels. Young adults also form a particular high-risk group during health crises, because they are more susceptible to be influenced by fake news from social media, to have high levels of anxiety and depression, and to engage in risk behaviors. 6, 11, 23, 24 During communicable disease outbreaks, public health and psychology researchers race against time to assess the early consequences of the emerging phenomena, therefore they typically adopt generic instruments which might not be specific for use in crises settings. To the best of our knowledge, there are no valid instruments to evaluate the induced anxiety, protective behaviors, and public knowledge following communicable disease outbreaks. Therefore, the primary objective of this work was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS), Protective Behaviors towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) and COVID-19 Related Knowledge Scale (CRKS). The secondary objective was to evaluate the relationship between communicable disease outbreak induced anxiety, epidemic related knowledge, and protective behavioral tendencies of the adult population.",

Items in RPB are aimed to measure individuals' protective behaviors in daily life when facing the epidemic, for example, one item in RPB is \"I cancel various parties in the event of COVID-19 outbreak immediately\". The PPB subscale mainly asks about people's protective behaviors after the exposure to possible infection. A sample item of PPB is \"If I get in contact with someone from COVID-19 outbreak area, I should isolate myself\". Finally, the questions in exam people's risky behaviors after the possible infective exposure. A sample item of PRB is \"If my family member or my friend is in health condition after they come back from outbreak area, there is no need to take protective measures\". According to the previous theory in public survey research, such reversed questions can improve the accuracy of the survey.(55) For the PRB dimension, the item-responses were calculated reversely for the further analysis. In consequence, the higher total scores for each sub-scale and the overall scale refer to the higher quality of protective behaviors. (Appendix 2)",

The results indicated that COVID-19 induced anxiety level can be adequately measured by the 6-item version of the CIAS. Communicable diseases outbreaks represent specific health-related crises that may impact people's emotions in different patterns according to their emerging nature, therefore, the CIAS was designed to cover the potential anxiety sources for general population during COVID-19 outbreak. The CIAS assesses anxiety from specific sources including going outside of the house, disease-related stigma, contracting with people from outbreak areas, getting suspicious clinical symptoms, updates of outbreak data, and resultant death, therefore, it represents a useful tool in measuring level of anxiety specifically related to COVID-19. Interpersonal anxietytransfer (transmission of anxiety from one person to another) may aggravate during communicable diseases outbreaks through the object-directed social appraisal theory which states that the person becomes significantly influenced by the information picked up from other person's anxiety expression. 34 The PBCS can also estimate adequately people's protective behaviors towards COVID-19 from three aspects: routine protective behaviors (RPB), post-exposure protective behaviors (PPB) and post-exposure risk behaviors (PRB). During the outbreak, any recommended public health measures for individual protection suggested by official health authorities need to be widely perceived and adopted in a timely manner, therefore regular hand-washing, social distancing practice, and face-masks wearing while in public were considered as the RPB of interest in this scale. In contrast to the PPB which include self-isolation and informing local health authorities after coming from abroad, doing home-quarantine and seeking medical advice as soon as suspicious symptoms arise, and reporting neighboring suspicious and confirmed cases, the PRB are about resisting health recommendations by concealing medical history and taking medications without medical advice.",

            "text": "Our SEM model implied that an individual's COVID-19 related knowledge predicts three dimensions of protective behaviors (RPB, PPB and PRB) in a positive linear way. However, for the level of COVID-19 induced anxiety, it only augurs RPB and PPB by positive linear relationship while it is negatively associated with PRB. The gender differences in protective behaviors are consistent with the previous findings which suggested that compared to females, males are more inclined towards risky behaviors for many specific events because females usually perceive more negative possible outcomes than males. 35, 36 The deduction that the level of knowledge towards COVID-19 increases the protective behaviors is consistent with behavioral predictions whereby specific knowledge helps an individual to perform more beneficial behaviors on the knowledge related event. The Health Belief Model argues that individual's cognitive aspects of health belief, including risk perception and knowledge, can impact the health-related behaviors. 37 Generally, more comprehensive, and accurate knowledge is linked to more health promoting behaviors. For example, among the elderly population, there is a significant positive correlation between knowledge about Alzheimer's symptoms and seeking behaviors for professional help. 38 In college adults, knowledge about AIDS enhances the HIV prevention behaviors. 39 For schoolchildren, the awareness of the importance of physical exercise promotes their engagement in sport activities. 40 The interesting phenomenon that the level of COVID-19 induced anxiety not only raises the possibility of routine protective behaviors and post-exposure behaviors, but also enhances the potential post-exposure risky behaviors underscores the complexity with which anxiety impacts behavior. On the one hand, some research indicated that anxiety causes the risk-avoidant decisions and behaviors. 41, 42 The reason behind the decision style can be explained by the theory that anxiety implies the potential threat and so helps people to perceive lower vulnerability to the threat. 43, 44 However, on the other hand, anxiety can have a negative effect, as it could accumulate and make one prone to risk-taking behaviors, especially under circumstances where an individual displays emotion regulation deficits. [45] [46] [47] In conclusion, this study developed and provided initial validation for scales assessing induced anxiety CIAS, protective behavior PBCS, and related knowledge CRKS. These instruments can be rapidly adopted for other communicable diseases during early phase of pandemic outbreaks. Knowledge is a facilitator for protective behaviors, while severe anxiety can be an indicator for risk behaviors during the early phases of outbreak. Therefore, public health strategies need to transmit timely evidence-based health information to the public and to monitor community anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms.",
