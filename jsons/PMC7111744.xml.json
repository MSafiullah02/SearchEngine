Most of newborn piglets infected by PEDV would be dying and pigs of all ages are also affected and exhibit severe symptom like massive diarrhea and dehydration.2 Infection with this virus has been become a serious issue in the swine industry and outbreaks led to serious economic losses in many swine producing countries, notably in Europe and Asia.3 The outbreak in 2009 from Thailand reported that it spreads throughout the country's farrowing barns in 2007 with 100% piglet's mortality.4 An epidemiological survey of PEDV in China showed that severe diarrhea in piglets occurred with high mortality rate up to 100% in breeding piglets up to 10 days of age after birth.5 Recently, new PEDV was noticed and its outbreak affects 23 US states by the end of January of 2014. PEDV infection in US swine industry caused severe watery diarrhea, variable vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in affected swine, especially neonatal piglets resulting severe economic losses.6, 7\n",

            "text": "Compound 1 was isolated as a brownish powder with positive optical rotation ([\u03b1]D\n25 +23.0 (c 0.2, MeOH)). Its molecular formula was assigned as C25H32O12 based on the [M+H]+ ion peak at m/z 525.1983 (calcd 525.1972) in the HRFABMS. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1\n), a pair of protons at \u03b4\nH 6.25 (d, J=9.5 Hz) and 7.90 (d, J=9.5 Hz) were assigned as H-3 and H-4, respectively, based on their HMBC correlations to characteristic C-2 at \u03b4\nC 160.1 (Fig. 2\n). From the NOESY spectrum, H-4 showed a correlation to a proton at \u03b4\nH 7.65 (d, J=8.7 Hz), indicating this proton being H-5, and the proton at \u03b4\nH 7.22 (d, J=8.7 Hz) was determined as H-6. The absence of other coumarin protons suggested the presence of a 7,8-disubstituted coumarin skeleton. Acid hydrolysis of 1 yielded d-glucose, as analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) following treatment with l-cysteine methyl ester hydrochloride and TMS derivatization (Supplementary data). Besides, the HMBC correlation from the anomeric proton at \u03b4\nH 5.03 (d, J=6.9 Hz) to C-7 (\u03b4\nC 159.6) (Fig. 2) and the coupling constant (J=6.9 Hz) of the anomeric proton indicated the linkage of a \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl moiety at C-7. The down-field singlet at \u03b4\nH 7.23 in the 1H NMR spectrum suggested the presence of an O-benzylic esterified methine of compound 1.22 The detailed analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) suggested the presence of isovaleryl group, which was further confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H-2\u2033 (\u03b4\nH 2.23) to C-3\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 26.5), from H-2\u2033 and H-3\u2033 (\u03b4\nH 2.08) to C-1\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 172.4), from H-4\u2033/5\u2033 (6H, \u03b4\nH 0.93) to C-2\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 43.6) and C-3\u2033 (Fig. 2). The HMBC correlation from H-1\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 7.23) to C-1\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 172.4) determined as the linkage of this isovaleryl group at C-1\u2032 (Fig. 2). The 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanol group was also elucidated at C-1\u2032 from the HMBC correlations from H-1\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 7.23), H3-5\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 1.35), and H3-4\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 1.25) to C-2\u2032 (\u03b4\nC 209.4), and H3-5\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 1.35) and H3-4\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 1.25) to C-3\u2032 (\u03b4\nC 77.8) (Fig. 2). Finally, chemical structure of compound 1 was constructed by the HMBC correlations from H-1\u2032 (\u03b4\nH 7.23) to C-7 (\u03b4\nC 159.6), C-8 (\u03b4\nC 113.5), and C-9 (\u03b4\nC 154.0), indicating the linkage of C-8 and C-1\u2032, and was named as divaricoumarin A.",

However, the calculated ECD profile for 1\u2032S- and 1\u2032R-divaricoumarin A showed the same profiles perhaps due to the hindrance by intramolecular hydrogen bond persisting between the sugar unit and isovaleryl substituent group. Thus, the ECD profile of a hydrolyzed 1a of compound 1 was determined. Interestingly, calculated ECD spectrum of 1a (S) isomer showed good agreement with the overall pattern of the experimental ECD spectrum of 1a,23 suggesting the assignment of 1\u2032S configuration for 1a (Fig. 3\nA). Furthermore, we found the similarity of experimental ECD profile between 1a and aglycone of compound 1 suggesting for the conservation of same configuration even though ester group was hydrolyzed from the structure by acid hydrolysis (Supplementary data).",

As like compound 1, protons at \u03b4\nH 6.29 (H-3, d, J=9.5 Hz), 7.94 (H-4, d, J=9.5 Hz), 7.68 (H-5, d, J=8.7 Hz), and 7.25 (H-6, d, J=8.7 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum suggested the presence of a 7,8-disubstituted coumarin nucleus. Compound 2 also possessed a \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl moiety at C-7 as confirmed by GC analysis of the acid hydrolysis product of 2 (Supplementary data) and the HMBC experiment (Fig. 2), as well as the coupling constant (J=6.0 Hz) of the anomeric proton. The unusual singlet at \u03b4\nH 7.35 revealed the presence of an O-benzylic esterified methine. Moreover, the detailed analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) suggested the presence of a senecioyl group instead of isovaleryl group of compound 1, which was confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H-2\u2033 (\u03b4\nH 5.76) to C-3\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 158.9) and C-1\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 165.9), from H-4\u2033/5\u2033 (6H, \u03b4\nH 2.16, 1.90) to C-2\u2033 (\u03b4\nC 116.1) and C-3\u2033 (Fig. 2).

Absolute configuration of coumarins with 8-substituted down-fielded O-benzylic esterified methine was determined for the first time through ECD analysis. Compound 5 with angular pyrano coumarin skeleton showed the strongest inhibitory effect on viral replication. Human corona viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) from same coronaviridae family share some similar replication mechanism with PEDV. Further optimization of anti-PEDV coumarin molecules could be a worthy approach for finding new antiviral compounds against the fatal human corona viruses like SARS and MERS.",
