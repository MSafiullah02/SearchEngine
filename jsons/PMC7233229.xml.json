In a comprehensive literature review encompassing study samples from 102 different events comprising over 60,000 individuals, Norris et al. (2002)2 described the worry, fear, distress, somatic complaints, and sleep difficulty that are common for many people early after exposures to traumatic experiences. Of the disasters studied, relatively few samples (11%) showed minimal or highly transient impairment; half of the samples showed moderate impairment; and, the rest showed clinically significant distress (21%) or severe symptoms indicative of a diagnosable psychological disorder (18%).",

Individuals may be at higher risk of chronicity if they have few social supports, a history of prior trauma, a history of mental illness, were exposed directly to deaths or injuries, had severe acute reactions to the disaster, or are experiencing ongoing stressors (including occupational or financial strain)2. Frontline healthcare workers treating the sick and dying may be at higher risk for experiencing psychiatric morbidity, at least acutely3. As with routine stressful and traumatic events, there is no single variable that determines individual outcomes; the additive total of risk and resilience factors will determine how each person will respond4.",

Again, past results help inform our expectations. The first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2001-2003 was ultimately contained globally through widespread quarantine measures. During these efforts, longer durations of quarantine were associated with increased reports of distress, as well as symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression7. Add to these effects the potential negative impact of the economic distress that has accompanied the widespread shutdowns during COVID-19, and the consequences for at-risk individuals may be particularly severe.",

Interventions for treatment of acute illness and prevention of chronicity need to be tested across the lifespan and along a continuum of intensity. Technological approaches, including digital and telehealth, will likely be crucial, but additional approaches must also be considered to ensure that interventions can reach those with limited access or familiarity. Research to understand and improve engagement and continuity of care, including approaches to facilitate (re)connection to care for persons with serious mental disorders who experience disruption in services, is needed. Finally, vulnerable populations, including those with serious mental illness or health disparities, are less likely to engage in mental health care, highlighting the need for innovative approaches.",
