Therefore, enveloped viruses have evolved membrane-fusion mediating glycoproteins that, once activated, refold, and release energy that fuses viral and cellular membranes. The influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is a prototypic structural class I viral fusion glycoprotein that, once primed by proteolytic cleavage, is activated by endosomal low pH to form a fusogenic ''leash-in-grooves'' hairpin structure. Low-pH induced HA protein refolding is an irreversible process, so acid exposure in the absence of a target membrane leads to virus inactivation. The HA proteins of diverse influenza virus subtypes isolated from a variety of species differ in their acid stabilities, or pH values at which irreversible HA protein conformational changes are triggered. Recently, efficient replication of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses such as H5N1 in avian species has been associated with a relatively high HA activation pH. In contrast, a decrease in H5N1 HA activation pH has been shown to enhance replication and airborne transmission in mammals. Mutations that alter the acid stabilities of H1 and H3 HA proteins have also been discovered that influence the amantadine susceptibilities, replication rates, and pathogenicities of human influenza viruses. An understanding of the role of HA acid stability in influenza virus biology is expected to aid in identifying emerging viruses with increased pandemic potential and assist in developing live attenuated virus vaccines. Acid-induced HA protein activation, which has provided a paradigm for protein-mediated membrane fusion, is now identified as a novel determinant of influenza virus biology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Abbreviations", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Cytoplasmic tail ER", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The influenza A viruses are negative-strand RNA viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family.

The F domain is trapped in a high-energy conformation in part by the presence of the membrane-distal globular receptorbinding domain (RBD) head domains.

Within 5 min, endocytosed material is exposed to pH 6.5-6.0 in early endosomes and then is slowly acidified (over 30-40 min) to pH 5.5-5.0 in late endosomes and pH 5.0-4.6 in lysosomes (Mellman et al. 1986; Cain et al. 1989; Grove and Marsh 2011) . Exposure to low pH triggers fusion-primed HA1/HA2 to undergo irreversible conformational changes that cause membrane fusion in the presence of target membranes or virion inactivation in the absence of target membranes (Skehel and Wiley 2000) . While the biological trigger for HA activation is low pH, the native protein is trapped in a metastable (high-energy) conformation and its activation energy barrier can also be overcome in vitro by other mild destabilizing agents such as heat and the denaturant urea (Scholtissek 1985; Ruigrok et al. 1986; Carr et al. 1997) . Human H1, H2, and H3 HA proteins from twentieth century pandemics were found to be activated and cause membrane fusion at pH values of 5.0-5.2 (Hoekstra and Klappe 1993; Galloway et al. 2013) , leading to the classical view that HA-mediated membrane fusion takes place in late endosomes (Grove and Marsh 2011; Sun and Whittaker 2013) . However, broader surveys that include avian and swine isolates have shown that HA activation pH values range from pH 4.6 to 6.0 (Scholtissek 1985; Galloway et al. 2013 ). This raises the possibility that isolates with relatively high activation pH values may cause membrane fusion in early endosomes, as has been proposed for HPAI H5N1 viruses (Reed et al. 2010; DuBois et al. 2011b ).

A comparison of LPAI H7N3 viruses found that a virus isolated from a turkey had a lower HA activation pH than a related virus previously isolated from a duck, suggesting the adaptation of avian H7 viruses from wild aquatic birds to terrestrial poultry may be associated with enhanced HA acid stability (Giannecchini et al. 2006 ). The HPAI virus A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1), with an HA activation pH of 5.9 (Reed et al. 2009 ), was rendered unfit for growth and transmission in mallards by mutations that substantially raised (HA1-Y17H, activation pH 6.3) or lowered (HA2-K58I, activation pH 5.4) the HA activation pH. While the acid-stabilizing K58I mutation attenuated H5N1 replication in ducks, this same mutation increased replication and pathogenesis in mice (Zaraket et al. 2013b ) and enhanced early growth of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) in the upper respiratory tracts of ferrets (Zaraket et al. 2013a ). Thus, a decrease in the HA activation pH has been shown to assist in the adaptation of H5N1 to mammals. On the other hand, an increase in HA activation pH (in the range of pH 5.2-6.0) has been associated with increased H5N1 virus growth and virulence in chickens (Hulse et al. 2004; DuBois et al. 2011b ). This agrees with observations that the HA proteins from HPAI influenza viruses tend to have relatively high (pH 5.6-6.0) activation pH values while those from human-adapted seasonal influenza viruses are lower (pH 5.0-5.2) (Scholtissek 1985; Reed et al. 2010; DuBois et al. 2011b; Galloway et al. 2013) . Two recent studies provide compelling evidence for a role of HA acid stability in the adaptation of avian H5-containing viruses to mammals (Imai et al. 2012; Herfst et al. 2012) . Two H5 viruses were adapted to transmit in ferrets, either A/ Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) (Herfst et al. 2012 ) or a reassortant virus containing the HA gene from A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) and the internal genes of A/California/ 04/09 (H1N1) (Imai et al. 2012) . In both studies, three analogous rounds of mutations occurred. First, two mutations were introduced into the R.B.P. that switched receptor-binding specificity from a preference of a(2,3) to a(2,6). Second, a mutation atop the RBD head removed a glycosylation site, increasing the accessibility of the R.B.P.

Intracellular pH is determined by the presence and activity of cellular vacuolar H + -ATPases (V-ATPases) (Mellman et al. 1986; Jefferies et al. 2008) , which may differ between different cell types, tissues, hosts, and metabolic states. For example, increased glucose exposure in MDCK cells leads to increased vATPase activity and decreased endosomal pH, thereby enhancing the replication of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (Kohio and Adamson 2013) , which has a relatively low HA activation pH of 5.0-5.1 (Galloway et al. 2013) . For avian H5N1 viruses, a relatively high HA activation pH enhances replication in the enteric and respiratory tracts of ducks and chickens (Reed et al. 2010; DuBois et al. 2011b ), presumably because a destabilized HA protein is more readily triggered for membrane fusion during viral entry. In contrast, a high HA activation pH appears to be a liability for growth in the mammalian upper respiratory tract (Imai et al. 2012; Herfst et al. 2012; Shelton et al. 2013; Zaraket et al. 2013a ), most likely because it enhances the susceptibility of pre-cleaved H5 HA trimers to irreversible inactivation in airway tissues. Mammalian airway tissue is acidic (pH 5.5-6.9) (Washington et al. 2000; Fischer and Widdicombe 2006) and acid secretion into the airway is enhanced upon infection by influenza viruses, lowering the nasal pH to 5.2 (Jacoby et al. 1988; Fischer et al. 2002) . Humanadapted influenza viruses with monobasic cleavage sites may also benefit by having a relatively low HA activation pH value, which may help prevent premature inactivation in the mammalian respiratory tract. Human-adapted H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 viruses from the twentieth century pandemics have HA activation pH values of pH 5.0-5.2 (Scholtissek 1985; Galloway et al. 2013) , and a naturally occurring mutation in circulating p2009 H1N1 viruses has been shown to decrease the HA activation pH from 5.4 to 5.0 (Cotter et al. 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 308, "end": 329, "text": "(Mellman et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 330, "end": 352, "text": "Jefferies et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 612, "end": 636, "text": "(Kohio and Adamson 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 694, "end": 716, "text": "(Galloway et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 859, "end": 877, "text": "(Reed et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 878, "end": 897, "text": "DuBois et al. 2011b", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1145, "text": "(Imai et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1165, "text": "Herfst et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1186, "text": "Shelton et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1207, "text": "Zaraket et al. 2013a", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1410, "text": "(Washington et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1439, "text": "Fischer and Widdicombe 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1573, "text": "(Jacoby et al. 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1594, "text": "Fischer et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1949, "text": "(Scholtissek 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1971, "text": "Galloway et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2126, "text": "(Cotter et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hypothesis for Role of HA Acid Stability in Influenza Virus Biology"}, {"text": "Membrane fusion is not a spontaneous process but instead is driven by the formation of hairpin structures that bring together the viral TM domain (embedded in the viral envelope) and the viral fusion peptide (inserted into the host cell membrane) so as to juxtapose the viral and cellular membranes. HA-mediated membrane fusion has been a paradigm for understanding viral membrane fusion and is topographically similar to intracellular membrane fusion driven by SNARE proteins (S\u00f6llner 2004; Wickner and Schekman 2008) . Recent studies add HA protein acid stability, or the pH at which the HA is triggered to undergo irreversible structural changes to cause membrane, to the list of molecular properties that contribute to the interspecies adaptation, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of influenza A viruses. Influenza viruses are internalized by endocytosis, and the HA protein is activated for membrane fusion by low pH. Many other enveloped viruses invade host cells similarly including hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, avian leukemia virus, human rhinovirus, dengue virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Grove and Marsh 2011) . These other viruses may also regulate their host range and tropism by adaptive mutations that alter the acid stabilities of their fusion glycoproteins. HA acid stability is just one of multiple simultaneous factors that dictate influenza virus biology, and many questions remain with respect to its mechanism and breadth of impact. It is not yet clear the extent to which this one molecular property interacts with others long known for influencing the replication, interspecies adaptation, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of influenza viruses (Salomon and Webster 2009; Belser et al. 2010; Fukuyama and Kawaoka 2011; Sorrell et al. 2011) . For example, the mechanism by which NA activity influences HA acid stability is unknown (Huang et al. 1980; Su et al. 2009; Reed et al. 2010) . It is also unknown whether mutations that alter the acid stabilities of monobasic HA proteins exert as strong of effects as those altering intracellularly cleaved (and more acid-neutralization sensitive) polybasic HA proteins. Compared to HPAI viruses, LPAI viruses are reported to have a broader and lower range of HA activation pH values (5.3-6.0 in ducks and 5.1-5.5 in chickens and turkeys) (Galloway et al. 2013) . Avian influenza viruses disseminate throughout the enteric tracts of birds, including environments of extreme low pH, yet it is not clear how these viruses avoid inactivation. The pH values in endocytic vesicles have been measured in vitro in cell monolayers, but it is unknown how the pH values of early and late endosomes vary in vivo in the tissues of various living species and individuals with altered metabolic states. Perhaps a knowledge of species-specific and tissue-specific endosomal pH values and extracellular pH may better explain why a relatively low HA activation pH is disfavored by HPAI viruses in avian species yet favored in mammals. The preferred range of HA activation pH in swine and whether swine may serve as a mixing vessel during the acquisition of humanpreferred HA acid stability is not yet known. Finally, the long-term viability of HA stalk-binding antiviral drugs and antibodies, in addition to the development of stalk-based universal vaccines, will also depend on the extent to which such treatments and prophylactics are prone to altering HA acid stability and the concomitant effects of such changes on influenza virus replication and the host response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 477,
