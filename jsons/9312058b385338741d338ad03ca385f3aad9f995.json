T cell response is a critical part of both individual and herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of developed vaccines. However neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2specific T cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19 infection. In both donors we identified SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones, suggesting the existence of immunodominant epitopes. We show that in both donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain CD4+ clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus [1] . T cells are crucial for clearing respiratory viral infections and providing longterm immune memory [2, 3] . Two major subsets of T cells participate in the immune response to viral infection in different ways: activated CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells, while subpopulations of CD4+ T cells produce signaling molecules that regulate myeloid cell behaviour, drive and support CD8 response and the formation of long-term CD8 memory, and participate in the selection and affinity maturation of antigen specific Bcells, ultimately leading to the generation of neutralizing antibodies. In SARS-1 survivors, antigen-specific memory T cells were detected up to 11 years after the initial infection, when viral-specific antibodies were undetectable [4, 5] . The T cell response was shown to be critical for protection in SARS-1-infected mice [6] . Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a genetic disorder associated with lack of B cells, have been reported to recover from symptomatic COVID-19 [7, 8] , suggesting that in some cases T cells are sufficient for viral clearance. Theravajan et al. showed that activated CD8+HLA-DR+CD38+ T cells in a mild case of COVID-19 significantly expand following symptom onset, reaching their peak frequency of 12% of CD8+ T cells on day 9 after symptom onset, and contract thereafter [9] . Given the average time of 5 days from infection to the onset of symptoms [10] , the dynamics and magnitude of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that observed after immunization with live vaccines [11] . The exact immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are yet unknown. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in COVID-19 survivors by activation following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 proteins [12] , or by viral protein-derived peptide pools [13, 14] . Some of the T cells activated by peptide stimulation were shown to have a memory phenotype [13] , and some potentially cross-reactive CD4+ T cells were found in healthy donors [14, 15] .",

Upon arrival, according to local regulations, they were put into strict self-quarantine for 14 days. On day 3 of self-isolation both developed low grade fever, fatigue and myalgia, which lasted 4 days and was followed by a temporary loss of smell for donor M. On days 15, 30, 37 and 45 we collected peripheral blood samples from both donors. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the plasma was measured at all timepoints using SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD domain specific ELISA (Fig. S1 ). From each blood sample we isolated PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in two biological replicates), CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, on days 30 and 45 we isolated four T cell memory subpopulations (Fig. S2 ): Effector Memory (EM: CCR7-CD45RA-), Effector Memory with CD45RA reexpression (EMRA: CCR7-CD45RA+), Central Memory (CM: CCR7+CD45RA-), and Stem Cell-like Memory (SCM: CCR7+CD45RA+CD95+). From all samples we isolated RNA and performed TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoire sequencing as previously described [19] . For both donors, TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoires were obtained for other projects one and two years prior to infection. Additionally, TCR repertoires of multiple samples for donor M -including sorted memory subpopulations -are available from a published longitudinal TCR sequencing study after yellow fever vaccination (donor M1 samples in [16] ).",

            "text": "From previously described activated T cell dynamics for SARS-CoV-2 [9] , and immunization with live vaccines [11] , the peak of the T cell expansion is expected around day 15 post-infection, and responding T cells significantly contract by day 45. However, Weiskopf et al. [13] reports an increase of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells at later timepoints, peaking in some donors after 30 days following symptom onset. To identify groups of T cell clones with similar dynamics in an unbiased way, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the space of T cell clonal trajectories (Fig. 1b and c) . In both donors, and in both TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoires, we identified three clusters of clones with distinct dynamics. The first cluster (Fig. 1bc , purple) corresponded to abundant TCR clonotypes which had constant concentrations across timepoints, the second cluster (Fig. 1bc , green) showed contraction dynamics from day 15 to day 45, and the third cluster (Fig. 1bc , yellow), showed an unexpected clonal expansion from day 15 with a peak on day 37 followed by contraction. The clustering and dynamics are similar in both donors and are reproduced in TCRbeta (Fig. 1bc) and TCRalpha ( Fig. S3) repertoires. We next used edgeR, a software for differential gene expression analysis [20] , to specifically detect changes in clonotype concentration between pairs of timepoints in a statistically reliable way. EdgeR uses biological replicate samples collected at each timepoint to train a negative-binomial noise model. We identified 374 TCRalpha and 373 TCRbeta clonotypes in donor W, and 797 TCRalpha and 672 TCRbeta in donor M significantly contracted from day 15 to day 45 (largely overlapping with cluster 2 of clonal trajectories). 438 TCRalpha and 533 TCRbeta for donor W, and 531 TCRalpha and 599 TCRbeta clonotypes for donor M were significantly expanded from day 15 to 37 (corresponding to cluster 3 of clonal trajectories). Reproducing the analysis using NoiseET, a Bayesian differential expansion model [21] , yielded similar results (see Fig. S4 ), suggesting that our results are robust to the choice of statistical model and parameter inference procedure. Note that, to identify putatively SARS-CoV-2 reactive clones, we only used post-infection timepoints, so that our analysis can be reproduced in other patients and studies where pre-infection timepoints are unavailable. However, tracking the identified responding clones back to pre-infection timepoints reveals strong clonal expansions from pre-to post-infection (Fig. 1de, Fig. S3cd ). For brevity, we further refer to clonotypes significantly contracted from day 15 to 45 as contracting clones and clonotypes significantly expanding from day 15 to 37 as expanding clones. For each contracting and expanding clone we determined their CD4/CD8 phenotype using separately sequenced repertoires of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations (see Methods). Both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets participated actively in the response (Fig. 1de) . Interestingly, clonotypes expanding after day 15 were significantly biased towards the CD4+ phenotype, while contracting clones had balanced CD4/CD8 phenotype fractions in both donors (Fisher exact test, p < 0.0001 for both donors).",

To identify motifs in TCR amino acid sequences, we plotted similarity networks for significantly contracted (Fig. 2d-g) and expanded ( Fig.  S5d-g) clonotypes. In both donors we found clusters of highly similar clones in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets for expanding and contracting clonotypes. Clusters were largely donor-specific, as expected, since our donors have dissimilar HLA alleles (SI Table 1 ) and thus each is likely to present a non-overlapping set of T cell antigens. The largest cluster, described by the motif TRAV35-CAGXNYGGSQGNLIF-TRAJ42, was identified in donor M's CD4+ contracting alpha chains. Clones from this cluster constituted 15.3% of all of donor M's CD4+ responding cells on day 15, suggesting a response to an immunodominant CD4+ epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The high similarity of the TCR sequences of responding clones in this cluster allowed us to independently identify motifs from donor M's CD4 alpha contracting clones using the ALICE algorithm [26] (Fig.  S8 ). While the time dependent methods (Fig. 1) identify abundant clones, the ALICE approach is complementary to both edgeR and NoisET as it identifies clusters of T cells with similar sequences independently of their individual abundances. Finding highly similar responding TCR sequences in both donors, despite their different HLA types, suggests that some of the identified responding clones could be public, and are likely to be found in other SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Using a mechanistic model of TCR recombination [27, 28] we predicted the probability of occurrence of the reactive clones (see Methods). For TCRbeta we also looked for the identified contracting and expanding clones in a large public dataset of TCRbeta repertoires from [29] . The TCRbeta occurrence probability correlated well with the frequency of contracting and expanding clones in this public dataset (Fig. S7) , suggesting that at least a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 responding clones are public and are likely to be shared between patients.",

            "text": "Using longitudinal repertoire sequencing, we identified a group of CD4+ and CD8+ T clones that contract after recovery from a coronavirus infection. Our response timelines agree with T cell dynamics reported by Theravajan et al. [9] for mild COVID-19, as well as with dynamics of T cell response to live vaccines [11] . Surprisingly, in both donors we also identified a group of predominantly CD4+ clonotypes which expanded from day 15 to day 37 after the infection. One possible explanation for this second wave of expansion is the priming of CD4+ T cells by antigen-specific B-cells, but there might be other mechanisms such as the migration of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from lymphoid organs. It is also possible that later expanding T cells are triggered by another infection, simultaneously and asymptomatically occurring in both donors around day 30. The major limitation of our study is that we do not know the specificity of contracted and expanded clones observed after infection. However, accumulation of TCR sequences from SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells will allow us to connect the TCR motifs we described to particular epitopes of the virus and estimate their relative contribution to the immune response. Databases of SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences combined with sequencing of patients' TCR repertoires will allow for the tracking of the adaptive immune response in the early stages of the disease, and possibly identify features correlating with clinical outcomes. We showed that a large fraction of putatively SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell clones are later found in memory subpopulations, and a subset of CD4+ clones were identified in pre-infection central memory subsets. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive CD4 T cells in healthy individuals was recently demonstrated [14, 15] . Our data further suggests that cross-reactive CD4+ T cells can participate in the response in vivo. It is interesting to ask if the presence of cross-reactive T cells before infection is linked to the mildness of the disease. Larger studies with cohorts of severe and mild cases with pre-infection timepoints are needed to address this question.",

First we selected clones which were present among the top 1000 abundant in any of post-infection PBMC repertoires. Next, for each clone we calculated its frequency at each post-infection timepoint and divided this frequency by the maximum frequency of this clone for normalization. Then we performed PCA on the resulting normalized clonal trajectory matrix and identified three clusters of trajectories with hierarchical clustering with complete linkage, using Euclidean distances between trajectories. We identify statistically significant contractions and expansions with edgeR as previously described [17] , using FDR adjusted p < 0.01 and log 2 fold change threshold of 1. NoisET implements the Bayesian detection method described in [21] . Briefly, a two-step noise model accounting for cell sampling and expression noise is inferred from replicates, and a second model of expansion is learned from the two timepoints to be compared. The procedure outputs the posterior probability of expansion or contraction, and the median estimated log 2 fold change, whose thresholds are set to 0.05 and 1 respectively.",
