Time to complete standard chart review was not specifically measured, but was estimated to be 30-60 minutes per patient EMR. Other studies have found that the use of chart review in contact tracing is time-consuming.3 The objective data provided by RTLS reduced the need to further verify and interview staff documented within the chart to identify additional potential exposures. In addition, RTLS may also reduce the effect of recall bias and need to contact health care staff, who must also rely on memory, in an effort to identify potential exposures.",

Although RTLS is not mature enough a technology to entirely replace standard chart review, this case study illustrates how an evolving technology can accelerate the process of active screening and facilitate timely cessation in the chain of transmission of infectious diseases. RTLS can be an important tool for infection control programs, especially in tertiary care medical systems with higher acuity and complex, vulnerable patients. Such hospitals are relied upon to care for patients with rare, high-risk, contagious diseases like measles, tuberculosis, and emerging infections such as Ebola virus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Notably, several high-risk emerging infections are transmitted by airborne spread with greater contagious risk to staff and other patients, and if discharged home, to the public at large. We believe that RTLS may show a more substantial benefit in these cases, because brief exposures at a distance are clinically significant and difficult to thoroughly evaluate by traditional means, whereas event mapping using RTLS is customizable to pick up such brief exposures.",
