The survey by Palache et al. [1] estimated that the influenza A virus (IAV) alone causes around 5 million infection cases globally every year, resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 annual deaths. Since the airborne routes play a key role in spreading respiratory pathogens from person to person, an enhanced understanding of pathogen transmission via aerosolized sputum and saliva droplets is vital to the public health measures aiming at reducing infection risks.",

[2], the droplets generated from human coughing, sneezing and talking are mostly between 1 nm and 500 \u03bcm. The diameter is a critical parameter determining the fate of the droplets because droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm would quickly settle while those smaller than 100 \u03bcm could become airborne and have the chance to be inhaled [3]. For airborne droplets, their movement could be dominated by the inertial and gravitational effects or the airflow, depending on the droplet size and air velocity [4]. In addition, studies on particle deposition in human airways [5] have proven that particles larger than 10 \u03bcm tend to impact onto the surface of upper airways while those smaller than 10 \u03bcm are more likely to penetrate deeper into the lower airways and pulmonary region. Some investigators [2], [3] hence recommended 10 \u03bcm as a cut-off diameter to delineate upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Apparently, appropriate characterization of droplet size is of great importance to the assessment of health risks based on droplet trajectories [6], and to the analyses of individual health hazards associated with particulate exposure.",

This process is strongly controlled by the droplets specific area and ambient conditions including the air temperature, humidity and turbulence. The calculation by Wei and Li [13] revealed that a droplet with an initial diameter of 10 \u03bcm needed only 0.07 s to reach its equilibrium diameter in dry air (0% relative humidity, RH) while a 100-\u03bcm droplet required over 100 s to complete the same process in 90% RH air. Given that the size of a droplet significantly determines its movement and fate, plus the fact that the viability of viruses within the droplet is affected by the moisture content and temperature [3], [14], an effective modelling of the time-dependent droplet size is crucial to the assessment of health risks associated with droplets exposure, for both the public and individual interests.",

            "text": "Despite the importance of droplets in transmitting respiratory disease has long been recognized, the theoretical models and experimental data on respiratory droplets are still very scarce, particularly in terms of the evaporation and dispersion. The classic Wells evaporation-falling curve (1934) [15] was widely used to estimate the droplet size as a function of time. However, Xie et al. [16] suspected that the curve was plotted based on experimental results through extrapolation using various inappropriate assumptions. In recent years, a couple of mathematic models [7], [9], [13], [16] were developed in which the effects of respiratory jets, air turbulence, droplet salinity and ambient humidity were partially considered. However, most of these models simply ignored the inhomogeneous humidity field induced by the evaporating droplets and the supersaturated water vapor exhaled from the respiratory tracts. Although some theoretical models, such as that of Chao and Wan [17], employed a transportable scalar to model the concentration diffusion of water vapor in air, the effects of inhomogeneous water vapor concentration on droplet evaporation were not fully addressed. In fact, the inhomogeneous vapor concentration, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the droplets, may have a strong effect on the droplet trajectories through changing the time-size relationship. In addition, the transport characteristics of water vapor in the air may be subjected to many factors including the air pressure and temperature, as well as the vapor concentration itself [18]. A transportable scalar may be inappropriate to model the transport behaviours. This is particularly true when the local vapor concentration is high. In order that droplet evaporation and transport could be modelled in a systematic way, the diffusion of water vapor in the air needs to be modelled mechanistically.",

Smaller droplets evaporate much faster than larger droplets because of the enlarged specific surface area for heat and mass transfer. Secondly, the relative humidity of air plays an important role. When the relative humidity increased from 0% to 90%, the time required for the droplets to reach their equilibrium diameters tremendously increased from 0.065s to 0.45s (692% increment) for the 10-\u03bcm droplets and from 4.0s to 28.0s (700% increment) for the 100-\u03bcm droplets.",

Fig. 4 shows that the vapor plume, analogous to the air jet, also quickly dissipated so that at t = 8.0 s no significant gradients of vapor concentration can be observed.

Fig. 6\nshows the size variation of the 12-\u03bcm droplets after expulsion. When the inhomogeneous humidity field was ignored (Case 1), the droplet median evaporation time was only 0.12 s. The evaporation rates of all the droplets were predicted to be similar, so that the time-dependent droplet sizes were distributed in a narrow area near their average value. In addition, the curves of the average and median sizes were almost overlapping with each other, meaning that the droplets were predicted to evaporate at the same speed. However, when the inhomogeneous humidity field induced by droplets evaporation was considered (Case 2), the median evaporation time was significantly prolonged (0.29 s). The time-dependent droplet sizes were predicted to be dispersed in a much wider range, suggesting different evaporating rates of the droplets despite the same initial diameter. As shown in Fig. 6(b), some droplets only needed 0.15 s to completely evaporate while some others spent as much as 6.0 s to accomplish the same process. Because of this, the average droplet size was predicted to decrease significantly slower than the median size. Finally, the inclusion of the exhaled humidity further decreased the predicted droplets evaporation rate (Fig. 6(c)), particularly the droplet median evaporation time was significantly prolonged.",

The results firstly revealed that the increased droplet mass noticeably enlarged the size of the high-humidity area and the maximum vapor concentration in the domain. At t = 2.0 s when the exhaled humidity had fully dispersed, the evaporation of the droplets was still significantly elevating the local humidity. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), the maximum local mass concentration of water vapor reached 1.60% when the droplet mass was 100 mg (Case 3). If the droplet mass could increase up to 1000 mg, the maximum local vapor mass concentration could reach as high as 1.97%, which was the saturated water vapor concentration in the air at the given temperature and pressure conditions (25 \u00b0C and 101.325 kPa). The increased droplet mass also changed the droplet trajectories. As shown in Fig. 9 (b), the gravitational settlement of droplets became more significant. Particularly, when the mass flow rate of droplets increased to 1000 mg, the droplets presented a remarkably changed distribution pattern, which will certainly result in different risk assessments if the assessments were based on droplet trajectories [27].",

Some of these new airborne droplets and nuclei could be entrained into the breathing zone by uprising airflows such as the human thermal plume. Due to the large mass of pathogens carried in these type of new airborne droplets/nuclei, the possibility of infection can be significantly increased. Similarly, some small airborne droplets could further shrink in size, becoming smaller than 10 \u03bcm and increasing the probability of lower respiratory tracts infections [5].",

It was demonstrated that although the airborne droplets took a predominant number proportion (0.90) of the exhaled droplets, they only accounted for a very small mass fraction (2.18 \u00d7 10\u22123) of the total mass of expelled pathogen. When the ambient relative humidity was medium (Fig. 14(a), RH 50%), although the total number fraction of inhalable droplets/nuclei and total mass fraction of inhalable pathogen did not change till 10 s after the cough, the number fraction of small droplets/nuclei (smaller than 10 \u03bcm) increased from 0.60 to 0.87 while the mass fraction of the inhalable pathogens carried by them significantly increased from 4.89 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 1.58 \u00d7 10\u22124, which was an astonishing 323-fold increase. When the ambient air had a low relative humidity (RH 10%), the evaporation of droplet was significantly accelerated. As shown in Fig. 14 (b), at time t = 10 s, 91.5% of the exhaled droplets had become airborne, among which 87% were smaller than 10 \u03bcm. Correspondingly, the mass fraction of inhalable pathogens sharply increased to 5.05 \u00d7 10\u22124 with 4.89 \u00d7 10\u22124 being carried by the droplets/nuclei smaller than 10 \u03bcm. Compared with the 2.18 \u00d7 10\u22123 mass fraction yielded from the medium (50%) relative humidity (Case 3), the 5.05 \u00d7 10\u22124 mass fraction predicted with the low (10%) relative humidity (Case 9) was more than 2 times larger. Given that the morbidity of many respiratory diseases is strongly related to the exposure dose [28], it is expected that the elevated mass concentration of the inhalable pathogen in the air could increase the probability of infection, particularly increase the risk of lower respiratory tract infections. This may also give a useful clue to the mystery why influenza always breaks out in winters [3], [29] because of the lower relative humidity in winters.",

The conclusions arising from this study are as follows:1)The inhomogeneous humidity field induced by vapor exhalation and droplet evaporation has a strong effect on the characteristics of droplet evaporation and dispersion. When the transport of evaporation-induced water vapor and exhaled water vapor was progressively included in the computational model, the predicted median evaporation time of the 12-\u03bcm droplets significantly increased. It was demonstrated that the exhaled water vapor can form a \u201cvapor plume\u201d in front of the respiratory tract opening. Despite its short life time (only a few seconds), the vapor plume is big enough to contain all the airborne droplets and significantly impedes their evaporation. Consequently, the airborne droplets were predicted to travel faster when the inhomogeneous humidity diffusion was included. Comparatively, the evaporation of droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm is insensitive to the vapor plume, probably because their travelling speed is larger than the dispersion speed of the vapor plume so that they are mostly located outside the vapor plume.2)The mass of exhaled liquid and the ambient temperature and humidity all have their effects on the droplet evaporation rate and dispersion pattern. Comparatively, the ambient humidity plays a critical role.3)Evaporation causes the droplet sizes to decrease, making some free-falling droplets become airborne and some airborne droplets become small enough to penetrate into the lower airways. Consequently, both the number density of airborne droplets/nuclei and the mass concentration of inhalable pathogens can be significantly increased, resulting in higher infection risks, particularly higher infection risks of the lower respiratory tracts.\n",
