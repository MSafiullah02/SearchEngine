            "text": "Reemergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a distinct possibility. Currently neither antiviral therapy nor vaccine is available. Viral replicase and protease are preferred targets for the screening and design of antiviral compounds and have been successfully targeted in several viral diseases. The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) main proteinase (Mpro or 3CL pro) plays a key role in proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which makes it an attractive target for developing drugs against this new disease. Recent report indicated that the proteinase inhibitor kaletra, a mixture of protease inhibitors\u2013\u2013lopinavir and ritonavir, approved for treating HIV in 2000, shows signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus.1 In particular, researchers in Taiwan discovered that two existing medicines, which have significant effect in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV (http://www.etaiwannews.com/Taiwan/2003/10/31/1067562739.htm). One is an anti-parasite drug niclosamide, and another is anti-psychotic drug promazine. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether the SARS-CoV main proteinase could be the target of these existing drugs. We performed in silico binding studies of the drugs using the recently identified crystal structure of Mpro,[2], [3] to provide information for anti-SARS inhibitor design.",

The surface shape representation uses a novel 3D surface skin model of protein topology, and a novel soft molecular mechanics energy minimization procedure is used to refine the candidate docking solutions. Unlike conventional 3D fast Fourier transform (FFT) docking approaches, Hex uses spherical polar Fourier correlations to accelerate the docking between 10 and 100 times faster than FFT docking algorithm.6 Here we used the following parameter set: correlation type = shape + three probes, post-processing = MM minimization, steric scan = 20 (maximum), final search = 32 (maximum), the others are default set. The structural comparison was performed by LGA.7 The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).",

It is noted that these values are too low, for example, the inhibitory constant of lopinavir was determined as \u223c10\u22127 by Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala.10 The reason for this difference is that the docked energy value from Hex program is a pseudo-energy, which is designed to give reasonably consistent units with conventional energy calculations, not based on experimentally derived parameters, and as a theoretical reference value only when performing the docking algorithm. Thus we do not expect these values are the genuine representations of inhibitory constants and we use them primarily for qualitative comparison among the drugs/inhibitors studied here. Because the lower the K\ni is, the greater the binding affinity is, hence HIV drug ritonavir is the compound that bind to the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV proteinase with the highest binding affinity, followed by HIV inhibitor PNU and anti-parasite drug niclosamide, and UC2 is the compound with the lowest binding affinity. Moreover, the inhibitory constants of ritonavir, PNU, niclosamide, promazine and UC2 are about 10\u22125, 10\u22123, 10\u22122, 10\u22121 and 10-fold inhibitory constant of lopinavir, respectively, if we assume that a value of 10\u22127\n mol for lopinavir's inhibitory constant is correct, the inhibitory constants of ritonavir, PNU, niclosamide, promazine and UC2 could be estimated as 10\u221212, 10\u221210, 10\u22129, 10\u22128 and 10\u22126\n mol, respectively.",

The results show that half of lopinavir is left outside the catalytic site (Fig. 4a), for ritonavir, the thiazole group (P1) and a benzene group (P2) are inserted into S1 and S2 specificity pockets, respectively, while another benzene side chain (P3) might be too long to fit the substrate binding pocket perfectly (Fig. 4b), there is similar situation in the inhibitor AG7088,11 which has been experimentally shown to not bind with high affinity to the SARS-CoV proteinase (http://www.nature.com/nsu/030512/030512-11.html). Thus the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir could be poor. Indeed, consistent with our predictions, experimental observation data indicated that both lopinavir and ritonavir individually have only a weak in vitro activity against SARS-CoV. However, the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to ribavirin and corticosteroid treatment regimens appears to reduce incubation and mortality rates, especially when administered early.12 Similarly, the half of niclosamide or promazine is left outside the active site (Fig. 4c and d), obviously the propane side chain in promazine is too long. For PNU inhibitor, seems it can basically fit into the active cleft, except the dihydrofuran side chain is a little bit long (Fig. 4e). Finally, the inhibitor UC2 binds to a position that is slightly away from the active centre (Fig. 4f), its neopentane or methylfuran side chain is a little long and makes it unable to insert into the active pocket properly. Indeed UC2 is the compound with lowest binding affinity as mentioned above. Taken together, our study illustrates that existing drugs/inhibitors may be used as starting points for the discovery of rationally designed anti-SARS proteinase drugs.",
