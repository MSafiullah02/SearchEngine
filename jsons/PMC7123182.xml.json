            "text": "In The Reluctant Passenger, the protagonist, an environmental lawyer named Nick Morris, somewhat contradictorily dislikes the ungovernable or disorderly aspects of the environment and animals. For example, he has a discussion with his friend and fellow lawyer, Gerhard, about masturbation that turns into an analysis of Romantic poets where Morris discloses that he masturbates to the Lake District of England. In response, Gerhard encourages him to consider Blake\u2019s poetry and to \u201ctry The Tiger next time\u201d (173). Nick explains his disregard for unruly nature:I am not a Tiger type of person, and such fantasies as I have tend towards the tame. For this reason my involvement in the ever-deepening intrigue surrounding Luc Tomlinson\u2019s baboons was as unusual as it was unwelcome. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the Environment should behave itself if it wants us to look after its interests. As a matter of fact, the Lake District is just about my notion of an ideal environment: well-mannered, contained, placidly packaged, officially protected and signposted. (173)\n",

Where the law fails them, I\u2019m interested here in how and why the characters work to protect the baboons extralegally. In light of Nick\u2019s discomfort with \u201cwild\u201d or untamable nature (or zoe) and his sexual fantasies about ordered and \u201ccontained\u201d environments, his reassessment of the unmasterable aspects of the world including his own desires and \u201cself\u201d leads him to break several laws in the course of rescuing the baboons with Luc later in the story. Where Nick once lived a life of abstinence to avoid the messiness and feelings associated with a sexual relationship, he ends up having sex with Luc in his house while the rescued baboons they have secured in the second floor of his house dirty, rearrange, and otherwise mess up his home, which had once been so clean and ordered as to appear uninhabited. This scene indicates the importance of a positive appraisal of desire to protect animals in relation to the limits of legal or animal rights approaches, positions which I analyze below.",

            "text": "In The Animal Gaze: Animal Subjectivities in Southern African Fiction, Wendy Woodward reflects on the interiority and sense of \u201cself\u201d of the animals in southern African fiction, including The Reluctant Passenger and The Heart of Redness. For her, these literary representations of animals do important work toward changing the way we think about animals and their rights. Woodward argues that animals have subjectivities, so they should be recognized in the South African constitution and be accorded rights. In support of her animal rights approach, she draws from Martha Nussbaum\u2019s philosophy of \u201cmoral agency,\u201d a philosophy which, as I\u2019ll discuss later, Braidotti criticizes heavily early on in Transpositions. For example, Woodward recounts how Martha C. Nussbaum critiques utilitarian approaches to rights which position animals as having \u201cmoral standing.\u201d She summarizes the utilitarian position through a quotation of Nussbaum:Because they are subjects of social justice \u201cif a creature has either the capacity for pleasure and pain or the capacity for movement from place to place or the capacity for emotion and affiliation or the capacity for reasoning and so forth (we might add play, tool use, and others), then the creature has moral standing\u201d (362). Nussbaum quite rightly argues for the importance of the agency of the nonhuman animal; in moral agency, then, the animal is active in this sphere, whereas \u201cmoral standing\u201d is conferred on the nonhuman animal for the characteristics he or she embodies.

Braidotti also critiques Nussbaum\u2019s position for the way she tries to intimidate new or experimental approaches and philosophies by asserting that they are relativist. Another problem with universalism is the failure to appreciate local knowledges and hence a tendency toward a monocultural, dominant view of the world.

Cary Wolfe argues that this approach to protecting animals is not sensible:I think we would all agree that an admirable desire of humanism would be to respect the standing of at least some nonhuman animals and to protect them from exploitation, cruelty, and so on. But the attempt to articulate that desire, which is an admirable one, in terms of the rights framework ends up foreclosing and undercutting that desire by reinstating a normative picture of the subject of rights that ends up being humanist and anthropocentric through and through, that ends up with a being that looks a lot like us, so that, in the end, nonhuman animals matter because they are just a diminished version of us. It seems to me self-evident that trying to think about the value of dolphins in terms of their being diminished versions of Homo sapiens makes no sense.

Both Derrida, and Deleuze and Guattari, write about Kafka\u2019s The Trial, which includes the story entitled \u201cBefore the Law,\u201d as a starting point for, or in the course of, their thinking about the law and what it means to be \u201cbefore the law.\u201d Wolfe spends much of his work on biopolitics describing Derrida\u2019s position, noting, for example, the lack of response in law as, constructed in the technicity of language, its automatic nature leads merely to reaction. Yet in this interview he emphasizes \u201cdesire\u201d in relation to the law.

He explains how a pragmatic application of Deleuze\u2019s philosophy bypasses the potential problems of an affirmative biopolitics: \u201cBy a pragmatist account, philosophy for Deleuze, as Paul Patton puts it, \u2018is the invention or creation of concepts, the purpose of which is not accurate representation\u2019 but rather to provide \u2018a form of description which is immediately practical,\u2019 one \u2018oriented toward the possibility of change\u2019\u201d (Before the Law 93).

The law, when viewed as the only outlet to protect animals, \u201cundercuts\u201d desire, then, by reterritorializing desire into the existing legal framework, appealing to its authority or authorities, thereby undermining its revolutionary potential. Or more specifically, for Deleuze and Guattari, the law does not undercut desire but instead is one of two kinds of desire: the transcendental law or the schizo-law. They argue:We should emphasize the fact of these two coexistent states because we cannot say in advance, \u201cThis is a bad desire, that is a good desire.\u201d Desire is a mixture, a blend, to such a degree that bureaucratic or fascist pieces are still or already caught up in revolutionary agitation.

Continuing their reading of The Trial, they argue:From this point on, it is even more important to renounce the idea of a transcendence of the law.

The import of Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s insight into the law, however, is that the law itself is empty, is nothing but desire. In other words, and I\u2019ll discuss this further in my treatment of the novels below, if the desire to protect animals, the environment, humans, and so forth does not exist in the exercising or administration of the law, the law itself (and the passing of more laws ad infinitum, even) will surely fail to protect them and ensure their futures. If those positioned as authorities of the law are colonized by Oedipus and their desires are therefore reterritorialized by capitalism, the laws themselves will not stand a chance against the disposing of these others for the accumulation of pleasure and profit by the arbiters of the law. If the law is really desire and its officials are colonized by capitalism\u2019s definition of desire as lack that must be filled through consumption and accumulation, their authority in the law enables the potential of capitalist desire to render all that lives \u201cdisposable\u201d to their personal interests and make everything available for consumption and profit in a logic of exchange. Thus it becomes all the more important to theorize desire differently and to think outside of capitalist logic which defines desire as lack, viewing desire instead as an opportunity to make ethical attachments toward sustainable futures. Since what appears to be law is really desire, if we take that observation seriously, decolonizing desire or resisting its colonization toward a postcolonial desire then becomes a significant intervention into the political field as part of a project to protect the others and the environments of our communities. Since capitalism bombards us with its definition of desire constantly, portrayals of what I\u2019d like to call \u201cpostcolonial desire\u201d in these novels offers a line of flight away from capitalist logic: a field of desire which can reorient one\u2019s sense of self and relationships to others, animals, and the environment",

Additionally, the secondary consideration of rights for animals continues to privilege the human over the animal, ensuring the continual deferment of protections for animals. Similarly, calls for the addition of more kinds of right, like Elke Zuern\u2019s argument for the case of \u201csocioeconomic rights\u2019 (66) as part of human rights, while certainly important in their attempt to redress economic inequality and its violence, which much current rights discourse overlooks, require their enforcement by the authorities of the law. Zuern summarizes her research: South Africans argue \u201cthat freedom can only be realized when civil, political, and socioeconomic rights are protected and enforced\u201d (xii). The phrasing of this observation gets to the heart of the matter in that the passage of the rights in law, if we agree with Deleuze and Guattari, guarantees nothing without an accompanying schizo-desire that would desire to protect the community. To further extend these rights to animals, then, without thinking desire differently toward a postcolonial desire does little to protect them or the locations where they dwell. Where the recognition of rights is important in a legal sense, poor conditions obviously still persist for many of those who are now extended rights in South Africa. For example, the poor conditions for miners which led to the strikes at many mines, including the Marikana platinum mine in August 2012 where several strikers were shot by the police, are evidence that the putting in place of human rights has not guaranteed the protection of South Africans formerly left outside the law\u2019s protection during apartheid.

She also describes how this instrumentalization of animals continues in an apartheid legacy: \u201cWild animals were exploited to fund the apartheid war, the secret agencies, the Special Forces and the individuals connected to them. It is no secret that the Nationalist government and its military machinery were involved in the illegal trade in ivory\u201d (51). These obvious conflicts of interest in the form of a desire to extract a maximum profit from animal bodies and being charged with the task to protect them speaks to the many ways in which the law is compromised through its colonization by capitalist desire. As Pickover\u2019s reporting on the exploitation of bodies during apartheid reveals, authorities often acknowledge or disavow the rights of others and choose to administer the law as it suits their agendas and financial interests. This problem\u2014that the access to rights and to the protections of the law are made to depend on those administering it (perhaps best described in Kafka\u2019s \u201cBefore the Law\u201d with the countryman seeking access to the law from the doorkeeper)\u2014was most obvious during the apartheid regime with the passing of laws denying the rights of black South Africans. In the context of this discussion of the law being colonized by capitalist desire, perhaps the most pertinent of these laws limiting the rights of black South Africans were those acts which prevented or hindered these communities from acquiring decent paying jobs, ensuring that the white community would benefit financially. In The Reluctant Passenger, the villainous Judge Conroy describes these financial benefits of apartheid to Morris upon telling him of his former plan to hand over the fortune he collected from corrupt dealings as a lawyer: \u201cYou no doubt imagine yourself too morally fastidious to benefit by money derived from an evil regime. I need hardly point out that for decades every white South African to a greater or lesser degree benefited by the policies and practices of that regime\u201d (404). Heyns\u2019 and Mda\u2019s novels shed light on many of these problems as they portray the corruption that informs environmental rulings: The Heart of Redness describes the conflict of interests of the government official deciding on the development project for Qolorha by the Sea; Heyns\u2019 novel in particular describes the government\u2019s collusion in the abuse of baboons in vivisection.",

He also currently maintains a blog entitled Books and Dogs, where he writes often about his dog Simon and dogs in literature (\u201cMichiel Heyns\u201d). Heyns has written previously about the potential of affect to challenge and threaten the cool reason often exercised in the violent treatment of animals and others in his earlier novel, The Children\u2019s Day (2002). His second novel, The Reluctant Passenger (2003), features a white South African middle-class environmental lawyer, Nick Morris, who takes on a case for Luc Tomlinson and a troop of baboons. The subjects of law, rights, and desire discussed earlier come into focus in the story as the protagonist becomes more involved in the case for the baboons. At the beginning of the novel, Morris detests the unmasterable and disorderly aspects of himself and the environment. Heyns\u2019 offers a critique of reason and mastery as Morris is frustrated by any disorganization or things that don\u2019t adhere to the norms of human rationality or reason. For example, Morris wishes he was an accountant as he originally planned, where the world is neatly divided and ordered into columns of debits and credits. He also resents his neighbor\u2019s dog, who shits on his lawn, and he chooses to live a celibate life with his girlfriend so he won\u2019t have to deal with the messiness of sex or love. In an early scene, the dog actually knocks him into a pile of shit as Morris attempts to clean it up to restore cleanliness to his yard. In response, Morris violently wipes the shit all over the dog\u2019s body, viewing animals in a pejorative sense as mere producers of dirt and filth. Morris prefers order and is a perfect employee under capitalism, an ideal manageable subject of capitalist biopolitics, as he is never late, is apolitical, and maintains neatness and order above all else. He makes all attempts to master and control his animality through regimes of culture, and he seeks to avoid encounters with his own non-human life or zoe (including his desires), as well as encounters with non-humans and the nonhuman world. In addition, his concerns for the neatness of his lawn and property cause him, rather comically, to forget to vote in the 1994 democratic elections. Almost all of his life is ordered and he attempts to master or control it completely. As Braidotti says of the dominant understanding of consciousness, he lives in fear of zoe:Relentlessly vital, zoe is endowed with endurance and resilience \u2026 Zoe carries on regardless: it is radically immanent. Consciousness attempts to contain it, but actually lives in fear of it. Such a life force is experienced as threatening by a mind that fears the loss of control. (Nomadic Subjects 110)\n",

Taking advantage of this status, in 1999 several businessmen devised a plan to build a slaughterhouse in Limpopo province to kill wild-caught baboons by electric shock and then process them into salami, polony, and tinned meat for consumption in Central Africa and Eastern Europe. Baboon body parts, such as hands, teeth, and tails, would be exported to Asia as aphrodisiacs. (2)\n",

As he embraces zoe as a positive passion, instead of a negative one which disrupts his orderly world of progress as he had before, he comes to value the complexities of the world in its open-ended becoming. He moves from being someone who fails to ever examine his own sexual feelings for the sake of order and not wanting to be inconvenienced by them, and who detests the disorder and dirt that animals bring into his life, like his neighbors\u2019 dog, to a person who finds himself having sex with his client, Luc, in his home while the troop of baboons they\u2019ve saved from a vivisection lab tear apart his furniture and cause havoc to the upstairs of his house.",

This desire to master the world is also something Jane Bennet challenges via Adorno\u2019s critique in his \u201cnegative dialectics,\u201d where he theorizes that violent behavior results from the frustration that humans experience when the world does not fit their concepts (14). Conroy\u2019s behavior and description of his motivations confirm his paranoid and narcissistic attempts to reterritorialize desire via his position as authority and arbiter of the law. Especially interesting here also is that like her son Luc, Joyce Tomlinson is closer to zoe in her embracing of desires as she often promotes Luc\u2019s free-spiritedness. In contrast, Conroy is colonized by Oedipus, which defines his desire as lack in that his life is devoted to filling the lack created by Joyce\u2019s marriage to Brick, and to a lesser extent his desire to acquire wealth for the manipulation of others. Conroy acquires wealth mostly for the purpose of attempting to separate Joyce and Brick. Joyce, however, largely disregard\u2019s capitalism\u2019s lure as it seems she loves Brick for himself, not for his finances. Of course, Brick\u2019s extreme adoption of capitalist logic leads him to view the baboons and their land as an opportunity for profit, and, anticipating this behavior, Conroy manipulates him into the business venture. The novel thus points to the precarious biopolitical situation for those seeking protection from the law when its arbiters are colonized by capitalist desire. In other words, Conroy\u2019s lack of Joyce in his life and his use of his position to accumulate wealth jeopardizes the protection and futures of South African communities, making \u201cdisposable\u201d those his position was created to protect. The desires of Luc, Morris, and the other characters who assemble to save the baboons, however, work to challenge these capitalist and narcissistic desires outside of the limitations of the law.",

Luc argues that it is obvious that the \u201cchacs\u2019\u201d (Chacma baboons\u2019) rights aren\u2019t being respected, noting how they\u2019ve been taken away for medical testing and vivisection, an issue I\u2019ll return to later. The protagonist replies: \u201cThe rights of animals are a much debated area in law\u201d (259). At this, Luc replies angrily at Morris: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in any fucking debate. Anybody who isn\u2019t unbelievably stupid or dishonest knows what we\u2019re doing to the animals \u2026 it just suits us to come up with debates. The law is \u2026 .\u201d Morris attempts to finish Luc\u2019s sentence, offering \u201cAn ass?\u201d, to which Luc replies: \u201cI was thinking of something more useless, like a \u2026 a eunuch\u201d (259). Their conversation about the law continues, describing how the law protects only certain people through their metaphor of eunuchs as Morris remarks, \u201cThey guard the Sultan\u2019s harem,\u201d and Luc replies: \u201cYeah. Great if you\u2019re the Sultan, not so great if you\u2019re not\u201d (259). The discussion of the law in terms of eunuchs and harems continues to develop the theme of sexuality in the novel, and also points to the exclusionary nature of the law, as it only protects those who are considered as belonging to the community. The discussion of the harem and the sultan also perhaps highlights the discriminatory nature of the law\u2019s privileging some and excluding others.",

Such a position, that we can only work within legal discourse to improve the state of affairs for animals, greatly limits the political potential for addressing the problems facing them. As Wendy Brown and Janet Halley suggest, \u201crights cannot be fully saturated with the aims that animate their deployment \u2026 they retain a certain formality and emptiness which allow them to be deployed and redeployed by different political contestants\u201d (9). In this sense, the affect and enthusiasm for protecting gets cut short when rights are viewed as the only avenue of intervention. Brown and Halley further explain the potential of critical theory for considering opportunities for politics and justice outside of legalistic frameworks, which the characters in Reluctant Passenger eventually take up in seeking extralegal, creative approaches: \u201c[C]ritique [in contrast to legalism] hazards the opening of new modalities of thought and political possibility\u201d (28).

Gerhard continues critiquing the lack of power that pertains to the law: \u201cBut where, as Mr. Tomlinson has pointed out, the law so manifestly lacks balls, we may have to rely on our own \u2026 devices for a remedy\u201d (260).

As a result they are able also to reinstate Mr. Haartshorn, the original Director of Nature Conservation and Development, who testified in the case that he was blackmailed with evidence of his extramarital affair and bribed into resigning after writing a report denying Brick Tomlinson\u2019s business proposal for the land under question. Morris and his team also use some compromising pictures of Minister Stanford from what are revealed to be sex parties for ministers during the apartheid regime, which involved their raping of young men in military uniforms at a building in Rocklands, the preserve of the baboons (163). The photos were given to Morris by Joyce Tomlinson, and later we learn, at the recommendation of Judge Conroy, to influence the minister\u2019s testimony so that he confesses that Haartshorn gave him the report denying development prior to resigning. The trial results in Haartshorn unseating the man who, in the old regime\u2019s pocket, replaced him and approved the proposal. For Conroy, this is a victory because it caused a large financial loss for Brick Tomlinson by preventing the development of the land. However, the baboons are still rendered unprotected after the ruling as they are stolen and taken to the vivisection laboratory, and bulldozers appear at the nature preserve. Thus even the legal ruling that uncovers the corruption and decides in favor of the baboons cannot protect them from the extralegal means of the capitalist desire to dispose of and turn a profit from them and their land. Heyns portrays in Morris a character who transforms his negative feelings about sexuality and animality into positive passions to work for the protection of the baboons, even outside the realm of the law.",

After Nick and the Adonis-like Luc Tomlinson walk naked with no deodorant on to meet the baboons (so as not to scare them off), Petrus, the alpha male Chacma baboon, takes a sexual interest in the protagonist: \u201c\u2018Bloody amazing,\u2019 said Luc, almost admiringly. \u2018You must have really potent pheromones.\u2019 He added with an unconvincing affectation of concern, \u2018I\u2019m afraid he wants to fuck you.\u2019\u201d (84). As his attentions turn to another baboon, Petrus does not consummate the sexual exchange in what would surely be his domination of Morris, who fears Petrus\u2019 great strength and doesn\u2019t want to engage in sex with a non-human animal, but the sexual arousal that the protagonist and his pheromonescaused in Petrus turns out to be the reason that Luc, the self-proclaimed friend of the baboons, initially finds the protagonist attractive sexually as well. The passage in Heyns\u2019 novel suggests the transversal nature of desire as it works across species and indicates the role that pheromonesmight play in sexual attraction. Like the desires that involve Lahnee O, Minke, and Corsicana in Tanuki Ichiban, and the Whale Caller and Sharisha in The Whale Caller, here again animals\u2019 desire and humans\u2019 desire for animals ensures the protection of the animals. The desire that arises out of assemblages (and not transcendental law) enables justice: \u201cTranscendent and reified, seized by symbolical or allegorical exegeses, it [the abstract machine] opposes the real assemblages that are worth nothing except in themselves and that operate in an unlimited field of immanence\u2014a field of justice as against the construction of the law\u201d (Deleuze and Guattari 87). Thus the law is not the house of justice; instead, justice dwells in the potential of desire that results from the immanence of our bodies and relations to others in assemblage. Of importance here is that this assemblage includes \u201cblack\u201d South Africans as well in the figure of Nick\u2019s colleague and her husband Mhlobo, who works at the Mail & Guardian and who supports the case for the baboons as he helps to discover the underhanded deals of the government officials. This environmentalism of the novel is therefore not a \u201cwhite\u201d or colonial conservationism but a postcolonial ecocriticism that benefits the larger community of South Africa. Heyns\u2019 novel portrays how the desires of an assemblage of human and non-human actors works against the mastery and control of dominant logics\u2014a postcolonial desire that presents lines of flight out of the paranoid and narcissistic managements of the law and against the \u201ceating\u201d or instrumentalization of the community.",

Camagu\u2019s alternative proposal, importantly, does not disregard the fact that the villagers\u2019 lives would benefit from some increase in funds. That is, as I discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_3 by quoting Huggan and Tiffin (20), he is not against \u201cdevelopment\u201d in and of itself. Instead, he is against those forms of development that position the developers in a parasitic relation to the environments and communities they develop, where they can better control and manipulate the community through their inclusion into the global capital system. His proposal is certainly one of development as well. The important difference is that the proposal is developed so as to benefit the community as it values local flora and fauna, knowledge, and labor, rather than devastating it as the capitalist casino and theme park certainly would. The villagers of Qolorha are largely divided into two groups: Believers and Unbelievers. The believers are descendants of the followers of the prophetess Nongqawuse back in the times of the Cattle-Killing Movement in the 1850s.2 As the novel jumps back and forth from the colonial past to the present, at times seamlessly, colonial and neocolonial themes are developed in relation to the environment and sustainability. The Believers are more traditional in their return to and appraisal of customs of the past and, as espoused by Zim, a prominent Believer, they are against the development of the tourist casino. However to be sure, Mda does not portray these two groups as totally at odds or pure in their difference: the groups are more complex because some of the Unbelievers value the traditions of others and have a mode of believing in unbelief, for example. These divisions along lines of belief, which were exploited by the British colonizers in a divide-and-conquer strategy, offer a critique of the present political divisiveness that becomes a distraction and more about self-interest and pride than working toward a sustainable future and protections for the community.",

In this sense, while I\u2019ve gestured throughout the project to how the \u201cnew\u201d South Africa continues to be similar to the past violent organizations of society, Mbembe makes clear that the new negative modes of relation and extraction are somewhat different in adopting this underground fashion. Mbembe continues to explain how,[i]n this intermeshing of temporalities, several processes co-exist; there are processes tending to make peoples view the world in increasingly like ways, and at the same time, processes producing differences and diversities. In short, contradictory dynamics are at work \u2026; it is too easy to reduce these dynamics to simple antagonism between internal and external forces. (73)\n",

Much of her writing in her essay about differing worlds and worldviews concerning the prospect of a mining development and its potential devastation of a mountain called Ausangate in the Andes parallels the varied logics and arguments about development in Qolorha in Mda\u2019s novel. For example, Bhonco shows disdain for many traditional practices and knowledges privileging Western development, while Qukezwa and her father Zim have intimate relationships with non-human animals, and great respect for the environment and the indigenous knowledge of the Xhosa. Like Caminero-Santangelo\u2019s reading, which emphasizes the open-endedness of the novel, its privileging of continued dialogue and its refusal to uphold any one character\u2019s or group\u2019s\u2014believers and unbelievers\u2014perspective as the truth or right view, de la Cadena emphasizes plural perspectives on nature and politics rather than the one universalizing understanding that often elides other ways of knowing. She argues that despite indigenous knowledge that conceives of the \u201cearth-being\u201d (or mountain in non-indigenous parlance) called Ausangate as significantly agentive, there are no guarantees that this knowledge will determine the decision people arrive at regarding the question of development:Pluriversal politics add a dimension of conflict and they do not have guarantees\u2014ideological or ethnic (cf. Hall 1996). People\u2014indigenous or not, and perhaps ethnically unlabeled\u2014could side with the mine, choosing jobs and money over Ausangate, either because they doubt or even publicly deny its being a willful mountain, or because they are willing to risk its ire for a different living. Ausangate\u2019s willfulness could be defeated in the political process\u2014some would embrace it, others would not\u2014but its being other than a mountain would not be silently denied anymore for a pluriversal politics would be able to recognize the conflict as emerging among partially connected worlds. And although I would not be able to translate myself into Nazario\u2019s ontology, nor know with him that Ausangate\u2019s ire is dangerous, I would side with him because I want what he wants, to be considered on a par with the rest, to denounce the abandonment the state has relegated people like him \u2026 to denounce the mining ventures that do not care about local life.

For example, the Qukezwa who married Twin in the past explains that \u201cwe never kill the snake of the spring. If we did, the spring would dry out\u201d (22). Later, in the present of the novel, her namesake tells Camagu about the agency of a specific snake, Gqoloma, who lives in the prophet Nongqawuse\u2019s pool: \u201cWhen it pays a visit \u2026 moving from the pool at the Gxarha River to another pool at the Qolorha River \u2026 it causes havoc in its wake, like a tornado. It destroys houses. It uproots trees\u201d (152). Camagu also respects his people\u2019s customs when he prevents hotel workers from killing the snake that appears in his room because it is his totem. In contrast, Xoliswa, who adopts Western knowledge as universal, dismisses indigenous knowledge as nonsense: \u201cWhat can we say about a man who believes in a snake?\u201d (161). Earlier her father Bhonco and others too dismiss the Believer\u2019s respect for indigenous trees and animals as \u201cfoolish\u201d and \u201cmadness,\u201d and takes a homogenous view of nature in suggesting that native trees could easily be replaced with \u201ccivilized trees\u201d (146\u20137). The Heart of Redness\u2019s indigenous cosmopolitics positions indigenous knowledge as frustrating Bhonco\u2019s attempt to deploy as a universal a Western definition of politics as reserved exclusively for humans and his attempts to uphold a human/nature binary. The \u201canimist materialism,\u201d Harry Garuba\u2019s phrase, expressed in characters\u2019 spiritual views of these flora and fauna suggests a mode of resisting their instrumentalization. Where Bhonco reads them as lacking in use value\u2014\u201cthese plants are of no use at all to the people. They are good neither as wood nor as food\u201d (93)\u2014Qukezwa and other characters\u2019 animism values the animals and plants on their own accord. As Garuba argues of animism, \u201cobjects thus acquire a social and spiritual meaning within the culture far in excess of their natural properties and their use value\u201d (267). The reading of desire in the novel offered here aligns with cosmopolitan bioregionalism, animism, and indigenous cosmopolitics. Where cosmopolitan bioregionalism offers a notion of place as process rather than defined space, this project focuses on challenging the defining or limiting views of subjectivity, desire, and other concepts that are also more processual. Indigenous cosmopolitics emphasizes \u201cnon-representational affect\u201d as key to its expanded notion of politics; theorizing desire, as one mode of affect, as a political potential to resist such exploitation coincides with these other concepts\u2019 emphasis on place and indigenous knowledge as modes of resistance.",

Messy dreams\u201d (171). This transformation of his relation with women from a position of dominance to a mutual relationship brought about by Qukezwa suggests that she is a feminist character. Indeed, Harry Sewlall dubs her \u201cthe quintessential ecofeminist\u201d (113), for her thorough knowledge of the plants and animals of her habitat, her challenges to the patriarchal traditions of the villagers, her dressing in traditional garb, and her educating others in the village about the environment and living in a sustainable way. Yet, as Caminero-Santangelo convincingly argues, the novel\u2019s characterization of Qukezwa is not an idealization of the indigenous as some critics hold, since she is more complex, transformed by history and cultural contact: \u201cSuch characterizations [of Qukezwa as the idealized ecofeminist] suggest that Mda reinforces the notion of an unchanged indigenous ecosystem that existed before the impact of colonialism and advocates for a return to an indigenous, properly ecological relationship between human and nonhuman nature.\u201d In other words, Qukezwa sees the similar logics of oppression at work that seek to disenfranchise animals, women, and others from a position of full standing and as deserving of the protections of the community. Her ecofeminism becomes clear, especially in the scene where she seeks to defend her environmentalist practices of killing some foreign water-depleting trees before the council of elders, challenging the lower legal status afforded to women in traditional Xhosa laws by gesturing to the laws of the \u201cnew\u201d South Africa that prevent gender discrimination. Qukezwa\u2019s role as a mother to Heitsi and her teaching him to swim in the sea at the novel\u2019s end demonstrate a particularly South African feminism that embraces motherhood as a political act, a mode of feminism in the country that as Zo\u00eb Wicomb explains differs greatly from the largely negative view of family roles in Western feminisms.

This extends to local flora and fauna, as Bhonco asserts: \u201cWe want to get rid of this bush which is a sign of our uncivilized state\u201d (92). Zim and his daughter Qukezwa, by contrast, follow traditional Xhosa customs, practice indigenous environmental knowledge, and greatly value local biota, rejecting many of the Western ideas introduced into their community. Qukezwa and Zim\u2019s embracing of tradition challenges Bhonco and Xoliswa\u2019s Eurocentricism, yet it too is not without problems. In her chapter that focuses in part on Heart of Redness from her \u201cWilderness into Civilized Shapes:\u201d Reading the Postcolonial Environment, Laura Wright reads some characters\u2019 engagement with traditions in Mda\u2019s novel in terms of Bhabha\u2019s notion of \u201ccolonial mimicry,\u201d arguing that they \u201crely on imagined identification with a now inaccessible and uninhabitable past, while simultaneously subverting and parodying that past in an attempt to monetarily benefit from its value as a marketable commodity\u201d (21\u20132). She explains the problems of this exploitation of tradition in John Dalton\u2019s obviously business-oriented and self-interested plans for a cultural village as she notes Camagu\u2019s view of such a packaging of tradition as \u201cinauthentic\u201d and as \u201cdeny[ing] the value of contemporary Xhosa culture\u201d (50). Wright also astutely observes how Dalton\u2019s planned last-minute heroics by withholding the letter he secured declaring the village a protected heritage site is an example of a \u201ccolonial mentality that indigenous peoples were not capable of caring of themselves\u201d (53).

While she argues that both the Believers and Unbelievers attempt to borrow and invent traditions in ways that are appropriative, Qukezwa\u2019s attempts to \u201crecreate\u201d (51) tradition seem to occur without such appropriation. Like Bhonco, Zim seems somewhat extreme, but in the other direction, in his embracing of past traditions, selectively deploying them at times in the imaginary fashion that Wright identifies in order to emphasize his difference and purity from Bhonco as when, for example, he shaves off his eyebrows. However, Qukeswa\u2019s drawing from tradition and indigenous knowledge, and perhaps from Nongqawuse\u2019s future-oriented biopolitics, is free from this Edenic imaginary and approaches instead an attempt to serve the best interests of the community by exercising an ethics of sustainability. In this sense, Qukezwa\u2019s breaking the traditional laws to cut down certain invasive and water-extracting trees might be seen as more in line with the extralegal efforts of the characters in Heyns\u2019 Reluctant Passenger to protect their community and the baboons.",

The fact that there are no hybrid plants is surprising and supports Wright\u2019s view nicely. However, there are issues with such a metaphorical reading. After acknowledging that the killing of invasive plants can be read in a literal sense as well, Wright goes on to emphasize the plants as metaphor as she attempts to read Qukezwa\u2019s killing of plants as a \u201cshortsighted solution to white intrusion\u201d: \u201cremoving all invasive plant species not only would be impossible, but also such an action can only operate on a metaphoric level\u201d (51).

If Bhonco is extreme in his disdain for local flora and fauna, and in his willingness to sacrifice indigenous plants, animals, and knowledges for English ones, Zim is somewhat extreme in his love of all that is traditional and disdain for the foreign. Yet Quekezwa does not kill some of the foreign trees to restore an Eden or out of a xenophobic impulse but out of concern for the community\u2019s water supply.

Rather like Judge Conroy in The Reluctant Passenger, who seeks to use the law to abuse his rival Brick Tomlinson, Bhonco appeals to the law in hopes of seeing Zim punished for his daughter\u2019s crimes: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he stand up like a man and take the rap?\u201d (214). Bhonco\u2019s desire is reterritorialized, seeing as he has no problem with the development of the casino city, which would break these laws, a project which the developers reveal involves the killing of many of the village\u2019s trees: \u201cHow can we call it a grove when we\u2019re going to cut down all these trees to make way for the rides?\u201d In response, the other developer remarks: \u201c[W]e\u2019ll plant other trees imported from England.

Camagu has the most obviously ambiguous relationship with the community of Qolorah as home and, indeed, with South Africa. He doesn\u2019t feel at home in Johannesburg, in part because he can\u2019t dance the toyi-toyi (the freedom dance of the Struggle) because he was exiled for 30 years and never learned it (28), which results in his being excluded from a number of employment opportunities. In Qolorha, he embraces his totem animal, a snake, in a way that impresses the villagers by showing them that he is like them and belongs. Roman Bartosch, through a citation of Harry Garuba\u2019s definition of \u201canimist materialism,\u201d argues that Camagu\u2019s respecting his totem animal is a \u201cdeliberate re-traditionalisation as described by Garuba\u201d and suggests that \u201che is calculating (\u2018I have gained more respect [\u2026] since they saw I respect my customs\u2019)\u201d (Bartosch 170). While this is an interesting reading, it neglects to consider that Camagu respects the snake first, and only later understands the influence it has on others\u2019 perceptions of him. A calculating gesture would suggest more deliberate and perhaps insincere performing of respect. Camagu, by contrast, seems genuinely joyful to have encountered his totem animal: \u201cCamagu is beside himself with excitement. He had never been visited by Majola, the brown mole snake that is the totem of his clan \u2026 . He is the chosen one today\u201d (98). Where not knowing how to dance the toyi-toyi prevents Camagu from belonging and imagining himself at home in the city, his ability to respect the customs of his people and his affective response enables a kind of assertion of belonging and imagining of a homeland in Qolorha.",

He is more of an umXhosa than most of us\u201d (147). Dalton\u2019s particular imagined relationship and belonging to the community, through knowledge of the language and participation in its rituals such as circumcision, performs a rhetoric of belonging that attempts to ignore or elide the colonial past. Yet he still benefits from his position of white privilege in South Africa in belonging to the \u201cwhite\u201d community, and even continues some racist practices against the villagers, as when he makes Bhonco ride in the back of his truck, a common mode of segregated, racist travel practiced by white men during apartheid: \u201cThe old man [Bhonco] struggles to climb into the back of the bakkie. Even though Dalton is alone in the front seat, customs do not die easily. Dalton can see a hint of anger on the elder\u2019s face\u201d (141).

The imagined relationships also reveal the violence that results from certain rhetorics of \u201chome\u201d as characters often seek to exclude or treat poorly those they deem not \u201cpure enough\u201d or foreign. Foucault observes this violence in the racism of biopolitics:[R]acism makes it possible to establish a relationship between my life and the death of the other that is \u2026 a biological-type relationship: \u2018The more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated, \u2026 the more I\u2014as species rather than individual\u2014can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be. I will be able to proliferate. The fact that the other dies does not mean simply that I live in the sense that his death guarantees my safety; the death of the other, the death of the bad race, of the inferior race (or the degenerate, or the abnormal) is something that will make life in general healthier: healthier and purer.

However, this logic of exclusion based on categories only suits his desire for \u201cdevelopment\u201d and what he thinks will be his personal benefit and profit. Indeed, he often disavows the importance of local knowledge, allowing Western notions of \u201cdevelopment\u201d and civilization to inform his thinking about biopolitical decisions.

We only desired them from a distance\u201d (217, emphasis added). The traditional laws and words of the elders here express a desire for animals that respects their lives and membership in the community and results in the community protecting them from being eaten. The passage highlights the differing models of desire at work in Qolorha as the indigenous notion of desire frustrates the view that capitalist desire is a universal or the only way to desire animals. This other way of desiring challenges the tourists and those who seek only a relation to the animals of eating, thereby showing capitalist desire to be but one way among other, different possibilities. The passage reveals that not only have the Xhosa in The Heart of Redness long had their own environmental laws, as Sewlall suggests, but also they\u2019ve long had their own ways of desiring animals. In contrast to Bhonco, Qukezwa, evaluates newcomers to the community in relation to the harm they may cause or, alternatively, their ability to further protect and sustain the community.

Wolfe writes about the need to deconstruct species and race as a way to prevent this problem: \u201c[R]ace and species must, in turn, give way to their own deconstruction in favor of a more highly differentiated thinking of life in relation to biopower, if the immunitary is not to turn more or less automatically into the autoimmunitary\u201d (56).

Wolfe discusses the desire for sameness that pertains to the law, and how Derrida\u2019s notion of \u201chospitality\u201d can challenge this problem in its ethical response to the other:[T]he reason that this [the ideal of unconditional hospitality] is crucial to biopolitical thought is that it keeps that zone of immunological protection from automatically turning to, as Derrida puts it, an autoimmune disorder.

So eventually, you know, how Aryan is Aryan enough? How Christian is Christian enough? How human is human enough? How \u201cproper,\u201d to go back to Heidegger, is proper enough? The horizon of unconditional hospitality as something to strive for is precisely calculated to remind you that whatever those lines are that you are drawing have to be always taken under erasure, even as, pragmatically those lines have to be drawn and are drawn all the time.

To be sure, she does not welcome everything in an unconditional hospitality because to do so, as Wolfe observes, would be to become apolitical and unethical: \u201c[D]iscrimination, selection, self-reference, and exclusion cannot be avoided, and it is also why the refusal to take seriously the differences between different forms of life\u2014bonobos versus sunflowers, let\u2019s say\u2014as subjects of immunitary protection is, as they used to say in the 1970s, a \u2018cop out\u2019\u201d (103\u20134). Qukezwa clearly exercises discrimination in deciding which plants, animals, and people are welcome to be part of her community and which aren\u2019t, often on the basis of their colonizing or harming the life and futures of the other members of the community.",

As Dalton protects the community in a roundabout legal way, Mda\u2019s novel provides another example of how desire exists where we think there is law to protect communities. Camagu and Dalton, in their desire to protect the community, think that this alternative way to ensure the casino development will not go through. Thus, in addition to Qukezwa\u2019s ethical response to protecting her community, Nongqawuse\u2019s prophecies, her desire to protect the community in thinking toward the future that led to the Cattle-Killing Movement in the 1850s in response to colonization that brought with it lung disease for the cattle, disease for the amaXhosa\u2019s crops, and the starvation of many of the amaXhosa, while tragic, continues to protect her people via the national heritage site enabling further sustainable futures. Laura Wright observes this as well:If there is any hope to be had, the polyphonic and temporally simultaneous structure of the text seems to suggest, it is in the cyclical and nonlinear nature of history wherein Nongqawuse can be read at once as the cause of a people\u2019s destruction in the past and, through her cultural cachet as such a figure, their salvation in the present and as the girl whose failed prophecy in 1856 is fulfilled late in the twentieth century.

Peires explains the biological conditions that resulted from the colonial contact and led to the cattle killing:An important cause of the Cattle-Killing was the lungsickness epidemic which reached Xhosaland in 1855. Cattle mortality was as high as one half to two thirds in some places, and many Xhosa lost all their cattle. The great believer Chief Phatho, for example, lost 96 percent of his 2500 cattle \u2026 The Xhosa began to believe that their cattle were rotten and impure, and that they might as well kill them since they were probably going to die anyway.

Among the many predictions that circulated at the time was one to the effect that the English, like all other evil things, would be swept away in the great storm which would precede the resurrection of the dead.

Perhaps the greatest reason for the British \u201csuccess\u201d in colonizing the amaXhosa, then, is this cattle disease that \u201cwas brought to South Africa in September 1853 by a Dutch ship carrying Friesland bulls\u201d (Peires 70) as it functioned essentially as a kind of biological weapon in the war between the British and the amaXhosa. The slaughtering of the cattle in an attempt to prevent the spread of this disease is an exercise in biopolitics. As Wolfe notes in critiquing affirmative biopolitics that fail to consider the difference of life\u2014those approaches that view all life as equal\u2014such an approach isn\u2019t practical (or perhaps desirable) given the destructive nature of some life forms: \u201c[D]o we extend \u2018unconditional hospitality\u2019 to anthrax and ebola virus, to SARS?\u201d (Before the Law 93). In The Heart of Redness, environmentalist characters often perform a biopolitics and hospitality that is not always affirmative but discriminates and seeks to eliminate the lung sickness, water-depleting plants, and neocolonial developments that would decimate the community.",

Of course, as history bears out, the situation and decision were devastating: one of the figures offered for the drop in the human population of the Xhosa people from the cattle killing is an estimated loss of 40,000 over a two-year period. Also, 400,000 cattle were slaughtered and the Xhosa lost 600,000 acres of land to the British (Peires 319). These tragic figures highlight the vulnerability of bodies that humans and animals share. They also point to the great dependence of the community on these non-human others for survival. Emphasizing our limited knowledge, and that to act at all we can only respond with a conditional hospitality, Wolfe writes of biopolitics:We must choose, and by definition we cannot choose everyone and everything at once. But this is precisely what ensures that, in the future, we will have been wrong. Our \u2018determinate\u2019 act of justice now will have been shown to be too determinate, revealed to have left someone or something out. (104)\n",

Mda\u2019s novel emphasizes, as Peires also argues, that the tragic deaths of the amaXhosa community were caused by the colonizing disease of lung sickness as well as the colonizing British, both of which established a relationship of \u201ceating\u201d these communities. Just like the development project of the casino city, which attempts to colonize and devastate the community, the British colonization during the Cattle-Killing Movement was geared towards ruining the AmaXhosa nation:The Cattle-Killing cannot be divorced from the colonial situation which was imposed on the Xhosa in 1847 by Sir Harry Smith \u2026 it should be remembered that the essential objectives of Grey [Sir George Grey] were identical to those of Smith and of colonial rule generally: to destroy the political and economic independence of the Xhosa, to bring them under British law and administration, to make their land and their labor available to white settlers, and to reshape their religious and cultural institutions on European and Christian models.

Derrida also emphasizes this emptiness in noting the lack of an origin for the law in \u201cBefore the Law:\u201d \u201cWhat is deferred forever till death is entry into the law itself, which is nothing other than that which dictates the delay \u2026 What must not and cannot be approached is the origin of difference: it must not be presented or represented and above all not penetrated. That is the law of the law, the process of a law whose subject we can never say, \u2018There it is,\u2019 it is here or there\u201d (205).See Jeffrey B. Peires, The Dead Will Arise: Nongqawuse and the Great Xhosa Cattle-Killing Movement of 1856\u20131857 (Johannesburg: Ravan Press, 1989). Mda draws significantly from J.B. Peires\u2019 The Dead Will Arise, a historical account of the Cattle-Killing Movement, for the historical information he includes in his book. Indeed, he dedicates the book in part to Peires. In The Dead Will Arise, Peires details how although extremely tragic for the amaXhosa, Nongqawuse\u2019s prophecies and the decision to slaughter cattle resulted from extreme circumstances of British colonization and disease. The slaughter of most of the amaXhosa cattle, then, offers an example of a biopolitical issue. For example, Peires writes \u201cthat the Cattle-Killing was a logical and rational response, perhaps even an inevitable response, by a nation driven to desperation by pressures that people today can barely imagine. I further believe, and I trust that the book will demonstrate this too, that the Cattle-Killing would not have been so fatal an error had it not been for the measures of Governor Grey, which first encouraged and then capitalized on the movement\u201d (x). The unfortunate coincidence of increased pressure from British colonization and the lung sickness that devastated their cattle therefore led to the amaXhosa\u2019s decision to slaughter their cattle as a way to preserve their remaining community. As Peires and Mda\u2019s novel bears out, the decision to slaughter the cattle after the telling of Nongqawuse\u2019s prophecies therefore figured as an attempt to secure the futurity of the amaXhosa people, even while it ultimately caused so many of them to die.Wright also critiques the alternative proposals that Dalton and Camagu offer when she says that there is \u201can uncomfortable verisimilitude between Camagu\u2019s ecotourist business venture and Dalton\u2019s invented capitalistic model in terms of the cultural village; the only difference is the product being marketed: culture or nature\u201d (54\u20135). Wright\u2019s critique of the project is warranted, and yet not all capitalist \u201cdevelopment\u201d is the same and, as Huggan and Tiffin suggest, part of a postcolonial ecocriticism is to challenge parasitic development, not all kinds of development (20). Their alternative proposals prevent the immediate \u201cdevelopment\u201d of the casino, which would surely spell the ruin of the community, rendering it unsustainable. Mda seems to acknowledge that this approach of ecotourism is not exactly the most radical approach either, as his later novel, The Whale Caller, offers a much more revolutionary politics, as I argued in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_3\n\n",
