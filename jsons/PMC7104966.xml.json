C. burnetii is the causative agent of an important and underdiagnosed zoonosis with worldwide distribution, Q fever. Livestock species have traditionally been considered as reservoirs of infection, with microorganisms found in high concentrations in the placenta and reproductive tracts of cattle, sheep, and goats. However, the potential role of other animal reservoirs, including cats and dogs, has been supposed.6 Antibodies against C. burnetii have been detected in the serum of cats worldwide.7 Moreover, it has been hypothesized that cats have been responsible for transmission of C. burnetii to humans in Q fever outbreaks due to exposure to parturient queens, in which various degrees of seroprevalence have been detected.7, 8, 9, 10 Nagaoka et al.11 provided the first evidence of active infection, isolating 9 of 29 cases of C. burnetii from vaginal swabs of domestic queens, and C. burnetii DNA was amplified through PCR assay from 3 out of 37 uterine tissues from cats with and without a history of reproductive abnormalities.12 In canine species, the epidemiological role of C. burnetii infection is still debated; however, seropositivity has been reported in dogs, and human outbreaks associated with parturient bitches have been described.13, 14\nC. burnetii DNA has also been recently detected in 4 of 54 canine placentas originating from aborting animals in The Netherlands.15\n",

There are over 250 pathogenic serovars that are adapted to different wild or domestic animal reservoir hosts, and serovars are further grouped into antigenically related serogroups. Infection with pathogenic leptospires can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from subclinical to severe and potentially lethal disease.16 However, there are only a few reports of reproductive disorders in dogs related to leptospiral infection; abortion has occurred in dogs after transplacental spread of the serovar Buenos Aires,17 and a report suggested that abortion was associated with serovar Bratislava infection.18 Some commercial companies that promote diagnostic devices currently suggest including leptospirosis testing in cases of abortion in dogs. In feline species, seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. varies from 0% to 35% depending on the geographical area and the diagnostic methods used16; however, despite serological evidence, there is little information about clinical leptospirosis in cats. A recent report described 3 confirmed and naturally infected clinical cases of feline leptospirosis presenting with renal failure.19 Stillbirths, abortions, and retained placenta due to Leptospira spp. also have been reported in queens.20\n",

Serial 10-fold dilutions of the Leptospira controls, ranging from 5 ng/\u03bcL to 0.05 pg/\u03bcL, were carried out to determine the increase in sensitivity of the nested protocol in the biological samples compared with the single protocol.

In this study, no evidence of C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA was found in cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the investigation of infectious causes; in fewer than the half of the cases had an infectious agent already been identified as a possible cause. The presence of C. burnetii and Leptospira has been previously reported in the same geographical area and time frame in which this study was conducted, although in different animal species; leptospiral DNA was found in equine abortion and stillbirth,25 whereas C. burnetii has been found in sheep in the same area.26 Moreover, diagnoses of cases of leptospirosis in dogs are reported regularly.27 According to these previous studies, it might be supposed that our negative results could be related to the fact that cases in dogs and cats not exposed to risk factors for Leptospira spp. and C. burnetii infections were analysed in this study. Indeed, Q fever and coxiellosis are traditionally associated with contact with cattle, sheep, and goats, which are considered the main reservoir of infection. In a previous study, which tested canine sera to detect antibodies for C. burnetii, dogs that had contact with ruminants were 10 times more likely to be positive.28 On the other hand, it has been observed that dogs living in kennels had a higher prevalence of Leptospira spp. when compared with client-owned dogs, and that, despite vaccination, risk factors for exposure are relevant for the infection.29 Similarly, in cats, a significantly higher C.burnetii antibody positivity rate was found in stray cats than in pets,30 and leptospiral antibody prevalence is higher in outdoor cats, as well as in cats living in urban areas and cats that are known hunters.31 It has been suggested that the active predatory behaviour of some cats increases the chance of infection for both C. burnetii and Leptospira spp., due to contact with reservoirs such as rodents.7, 16 Unfortunately, in the current study, a serological investigation to establish the exposure to these pathogens was not performed in the bitches and queens, and no indication of breed or lifestyle was specifically requested upon admission of the specimens. Further studies targeting especially populations at risk for these infections should be designed, using animals exposed to water sources or environments contaminated by faeces, urine, or parturition products of animal reservoirs in order to increase the likelihood of finding positive results and determining whether C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are responsible for canine and feline abortion and neonatal losses.",
