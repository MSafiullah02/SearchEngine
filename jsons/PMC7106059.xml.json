Patients are anesthetized with isoflurane and gently restrained in dorsal or lateral recumbency. With smaller patients, the head may be restrained with a loop of string attached to a gauze square-looped around the upper incisors. The head is pulled dorsally and cranially. The area of the vessel is prepared with aseptic technique, and the vein is occluded at the thoracic inlet. The vein may not be visualized in some species but runs from the manubrium to just below the angle of the jaw in all species. The short neck of a rodent and the depth of the jugular vein, often deep to salivary glands, may make entering the vein from cranial to caudal easier for some practitioners. Withdraw blood slowly to avoid collapse of these small vessels. If the first attempt to draw blood is unsuccessful, withdraw the needle slightly; it may have been placed too deeply. If blood stops flowing, do not continue to draw back on the syringe. The vein may have collapsed, or the needle may have attached to the vessel wall. Rotate the needle slightly, or apply slight pressure on the needle (either above, below, or to the side of puncture site).",

When taking blood from the artery, a 25-gauge needle on a 1-mL syringe barrel (no plunger) may be used and the blood is allowed to flow under its own pressure. Flicking or gentle massaging of the tail toward the needle may help facilitate bleeding. Remove the needle and apply gentle pressure to the site of entry to ensure good hemostasis.

When several samples are needed within a short time period, the original wound can be reopened by removing the clot.

Bleeding usually stops immediately and completely when the tube is removed; however, it may be necessary to apply gentle pressure on the eyeball for a brief moment by closing the skin above and below the eye with your first finger and thumb.
